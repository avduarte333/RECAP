   "and then what a happiness would it have been could hester prynne have heard her clear birdlike voice mingling with the uproar of other childish voices and have distinguished and unravelled her own darling ’ s tones amid all the entangled outcry of a group of sportive children but this could never be pearl was a born outcast of the infantile world an imp of evil emblem and product of sin she had no right among christened infants nothing was more remarkable than the instinct as it seemed with which the child comprehended her loneliness the destiny that had drawn an inviolable circle round about her the whole peculiarity in short of her position in respect to other children never since her release from prison had hester met the public gaze without her in all her walks about the town pearl too was there first as the babe in arms and afterwards as the little girl small companion of her mother holding a forefinger with her whole grasp and tripping along at the rate of three or four footsteps to one of hester ’ s she saw the children of the settlement on the grassy margin of the street or at the domestic thresholds disporting themselves in such grim fashion as the puritanic nurture would permit playing at going to church perchance or at scourging quakers or taking scalps in a shamfight with the indians or scaring one another with freaks of imitative witchcraft pearl saw and gazed intently but never sought to make acquaintance if spoken to she would not speak again if the children gathered about her as they sometimes did pearl would grow positively terrible in her puny wrath snatching up stones to fling at them with shrill incoherent exclamations that made her mother tremble because they had so much the sound of a witch ’ s anathemas in some unknown tongue the truth was that the little puritans being of the most intolerant brood that ever lived had got a vague idea of something outlandish unearthly or at variance with ordinary fashions in the mother and child and therefore scorned them in their hearts and not unfrequently reviled them with their tongues pearl felt the sentiment and requited it with the bitterest hatred that can be supposed to rankle in a childish bosom these outbreaks of a fierce temper had a kind of value and even comfort for her mother because there was at least an intelligible earnestness in the mood instead of the fitful caprice that so often thwarted her in the child ’ s manifestations it appalled her nevertheless to discern here again a shadowy reflection of the evil that had existed in herself all this enmity and passion had pearl inherited by inalienable right out of hester ’ s heart mother and daughter stood together in the same circle of seclusion from human society and in the nature of the child seemed to be perpetuated those unquiet elements that had distracted hester prynne before pearl ’ s birth but had since begun to be soothed away by the softening influences of maternity at home within and around her mother ’ s cottage pearl wanted not a wide and various circle of acquaintance the spell of life went forth from her evercreative spirit and communicated itself to a thousand objects as a torch kindles a flame wherever it may be applied the unlikeliest materialsa stick a bunch of rags a flowerwere the puppets of pearl ’ s witchcraft and without undergoing any outward change became spiritually adapted to whatever drama occupied the stage of her inner world her one babyvoice served a multitude of imaginary personages old and young to talk withal the pinetrees aged black and solemn and flinging groans and other melancholy utterances on the breeze needed little transformation to figure as puritan elders the ugliest weeds of the garden were their children whom pearl smote down and uprooted most unmercifully it was wonderful the vast variety of forms into which she threw her intellect with no continuity indeed but darting up and dancing always in a state of preternatural activitysoon sinking down as if exhausted by so rapid and feverish a tide of lifeand succeeded by other shapes of a similar wild energy it was like nothing so much as the phantasmagoric play of the northern lights in the mere exercise of the fancy however and the sportiveness of a growing mind there might be little more than was observable in other children of bright faculties except as pearl in the dearth of human playmates was thrown more upon the visionary throng which she created the singularity lay in the hostile feelings with which the child regarded all these offspring of her own heart and mind she never created a friend but seemed always to be sowing broadcast the dragon ’ s teeth whence sprung a harvest of armed enemies against whom she rushed to battle it was inexpressibly sadthen what depth of sorrow to a mother who felt in her own heart the causeto observe in one so young this constant recognition of an adverse world and so fierce a training of the energies that were to make good her cause in the contest that"

   "but where was little pearl if still alive she must now have been in the flush and bloom of early womanhood none knewnor ever learned with the fulness of perfect certaintywhether the elfchild had gone thus untimely to a maiden grave or whether her wild rich nature had been softened and subdued and made capable of a woman ’ s gentle happiness but through the remainder of hester ’ s life there were indications that the recluse of the scarlet letter was the object of love and interest with some inhabitant of another land letters came with armorial seals upon them though of bearings unknown to english heraldry in the cottage there were articles of comfort and luxury such as hester never cared to use but which only wealth could have purchased and affection have imagined for her there were trifles too little ornaments beautiful tokens of a continual remembrance that must have been wrought by delicate fingers at the impulse of a fond heart and once hester was seen embroidering a babygarment with such a lavish richness of golden fancy as would have raised a public tumult had any infant thus apparelled been shown to our soberhued community in fine the gossips of that day believedand mr surveyor pue who made investigations a century later believedand one of his recent successors in office moreover faithfully believesthat pearl was not only alive but married and happy and mindful of her mother and that she would most joyfully have entertained that sad and lonely mother at her fireside but there was a more real life for hester prynne here in new england than in that unknown region where pearl had found a home here had been her sin here her sorrow and here was yet to be her penitence she had returned therefore and resumedof her own free will for not the sternest magistrate of that iron period would have imposed itresumed the symbol of which we have related so dark a tale never afterwards did it quit her bosom but in the lapse of the toilsome thoughtful and selfdevoted years that made up hester ’ s life the scarlet letter ceased to be a stigma which attracted the world ’ s scorn and bitterness and became a type of something to be sorrowed over and looked upon with awe yet with reverence too and as hester prynne had no selfish ends nor lived in any measure for her own profit and enjoyment people brought all their sorrows and perplexities and besought her counsel as one who had herself gone through a mighty trouble women more especiallyin the continually recurring trials of wounded wasted wronged misplaced or erring and sinful passionor with the dreary burden of a heart unyielded because unvalued and unsoughtcame to hester ’ s cottage demanding why they were so wretched and what the remedy hester comforted and counselled them as best she might she assured them too of her firm belief that at some brighter period when the world should have grown ripe for it in heaven ’ s own time a new truth would be revealed in order to establish the whole relation between man and woman on a surer ground of mutual happiness earlier in life hester had vainly imagined that she herself might be the destined prophetess but had long since recognized the impossibility that any mission of divine and mysterious truth should be confided to a woman stained with sin bowed down with shame or even burdened with a lifelong sorrow the angel and apostle of the coming revelation must be a woman indeed but lofty pure and beautiful and wise moreover not through dusky grief but the ethereal medium of joy and showing how sacred love should make us happy by the truest test of a life successful to such an end so said hester prynne and glanced her sad eyes downward at the scarlet letter and after many many years a new grave was delved near an old and sunken one in that burialground beside which king ’ s chapel has since been built it was near that old and sunken grave yet with a space between as if the dust of the two sleepers had no right to mingle yet one tombstone served for both all around there were monuments carved with armorial bearings and on this simple slab of slateas the curious investigator may still discern and perplex himself with the purportthere appeared the semblance of an engraved escutcheon it bore a device a herald ’ s wording of which might serve for a motto and brief description of our now concluded legend so sombre is it and relieved only by one everglowing point of light gloomier than the shadow “ on a field sable the letter a gules ”"
