   "utterance they came strutting out of his lungs like the crow of a cock or the blast of a clarion looking at him merely as an animaland there was very little else to look athe was a most satisfactory object from the thorough healthfulness and wholesomeness of his system and his capacity at that extreme age to enjoy all or nearly all the delights which he had ever aimed at or conceived of the careless security of his life in the customhouse on a regular income and with but slight and infrequent apprehensions of removal had no doubt contributed to make time pass lightly over him the original and more potent causes however lay in the rare perfection of his animal nature the moderate proportion of intellect and the very trifling admixture of moral and spiritual ingredients these latter qualities indeed being in barely enough measure to keep the old gentleman from walking on allfours he possessed no power of thought no depth of feeling no troublesome sensibilities nothing in short but a few commonplace instincts which aided by the cheerful temper that grew inevitably out of his physical wellbeing did duty very respectably and to general acceptance in lieu of a heart he had been the husband of three wives all long since dead the father of twenty children most of whom at every age of childhood or maturity had likewise returned to dust here one would suppose might have been sorrow enough to imbue the sunniest disposition through and through with a sable tinge not so with our old inspector one brief sigh sufficed to carry off the entire burden of these dismal reminiscences the next moment he was as ready for sport as any unbreeched infant far readier than the collector ’ s junior clerk who at nineteen years was much the elder and graver man of the two i used to watch and study this patriarchal personage with i think livelier curiosity than any other form of humanity there presented to my notice he was in truth a rare phenomenon so perfect in one point of view so shallow so delusive so impalpable such an absolute nonentity in every other my conclusion was that he had no soul no heart no mind nothing as i have already said but instincts and yet withal so cunningly had the few materials of his character been put together that there was no painful perception of deficiency but on my part an entire contentment with what i found in him it might be difficultand it was soto conceive how he should exist hereafter so earthly and sensuous did he seem but surely his existence here admitting that it was to terminate with his last breath had been not unkindly given with no higher moral responsibilities than the beasts of the field but with a larger scope of enjoyment than theirs and with all their blessed immunity from the dreariness and duskiness of age one point in which he had vastly the advantage over his fourfooted brethren was his ability to recollect the good dinners which it had made no small portion of the happiness of his life to eat his gourmandism was a highly agreeable trait and to hear him talk of roastmeat was as appetizing as a pickle or an oyster as he possessed no higher attribute and neither sacrificed nor vitiated any spiritual endowment by devoting all his energies and ingenuities to subserve the delight and profit of his maw it always pleased and satisfied me to hear him expatiate on fish poultry and butcher ’ s meat and the most eligible methods of preparing them for the table his reminiscences of good cheer however ancient the date of the actual banquet seemed to bring the savor of pig or turkey under one ’ s very nostrils there were flavors on his palate that had lingered there not less than sixty or seventy years and were still apparently as fresh as that of the muttonchop which he had just devoured for his breakfast i have heard him smack his lips over dinners every guest at which except himself had long been food for worms it was marvellous to observe how the ghosts of bygone meals were continually rising up before him not in anger or retribution but as if grateful for his former appreciation and seeking to resuscitate an endless series of enjoyment at once shadowy and sensual a tenderloin of beef a hindquarter of veal a sparerib of pork a particular chicken or a remarkably praiseworthy turkey which had perhaps adorned his board in the days of the elder adams would be remembered while all the subsequent experience of our race and all the events that brightened or darkened his individual career had gone over him with as little permanent effect as the passing breeze the chief tragic event of the old man ’ s life so far as i could judge was his mishap with a certain goose which lived and died some twenty or forty years ago a goose of most promising figure but which at table proved so inveterately tough that the carvingknife would make no impression on its carcass and it could only be divided with an axe and handsaw but it is time to quit this sketch on which however i should be glad to dwell at considerably more length because of all men whom i have ever known this individual was fittest to be a customhouse officer most persons owing to causes which i may not have space to hint at suffer moral detriment from this peculiar mode of life the old inspector was incapable of it and were he to continue in office to the end of time would be just as good as he was then and sit down to dinner with just as"

   "and then what a happiness would it have been could hester prynne have heard her clear birdlike voice mingling with the uproar of other childish voices and have distinguished and unravelled her own darling ’ s tones amid all the entangled outcry of a group of sportive children but this could never be pearl was a born outcast of the infantile world an imp of evil emblem and product of sin she had no right among christened infants nothing was more remarkable than the instinct as it seemed with which the child comprehended her loneliness the destiny that had drawn an inviolable circle round about her the whole peculiarity in short of her position in respect to other children never since her release from prison had hester met the public gaze without her in all her walks about the town pearl too was there first as the babe in arms and afterwards as the little girl small companion of her mother holding a forefinger with her whole grasp and tripping along at the rate of three or four footsteps to one of hester ’ s she saw the children of the settlement on the grassy margin of the street or at the domestic thresholds disporting themselves in such grim fashion as the puritanic nurture would permit playing at going to church perchance or at scourging quakers or taking scalps in a shamfight with the indians or scaring one another with freaks of imitative witchcraft pearl saw and gazed intently but never sought to make acquaintance if spoken to she would not speak again if the children gathered about her as they sometimes did pearl would grow positively terrible in her puny wrath snatching up stones to fling at them with shrill incoherent exclamations that made her mother tremble because they had so much the sound of a witch ’ s anathemas in some unknown tongue the truth was that the little puritans being of the most intolerant brood that ever lived had got a vague idea of something outlandish unearthly or at variance with ordinary fashions in the mother and child and therefore scorned them in their hearts and not unfrequently reviled them with their tongues pearl felt the sentiment and requited it with the bitterest hatred that can be supposed to rankle in a childish bosom these outbreaks of a fierce temper had a kind of value and even comfort for her mother because there was at least an intelligible earnestness in the mood instead of the fitful caprice that so often thwarted her in the child ’ s manifestations it appalled her nevertheless to discern here again a shadowy reflection of the evil that had existed in herself all this enmity and passion had pearl inherited by inalienable right out of hester ’ s heart mother and daughter stood together in the same circle of seclusion from human society and in the nature of the child seemed to be perpetuated those unquiet elements that had distracted hester prynne before pearl ’ s birth but had since begun to be soothed away by the softening influences of maternity at home within and around her mother ’ s cottage pearl wanted not a wide and various circle of acquaintance the spell of life went forth from her evercreative spirit and communicated itself to a thousand objects as a torch kindles a flame wherever it may be applied the unlikeliest materialsa stick a bunch of rags a flowerwere the puppets of pearl ’ s witchcraft and without undergoing any outward change became spiritually adapted to whatever drama occupied the stage of her inner world her one babyvoice served a multitude of imaginary personages old and young to talk withal the pinetrees aged black and solemn and flinging groans and other melancholy utterances on the breeze needed little transformation to figure as puritan elders the ugliest weeds of the garden were their children whom pearl smote down and uprooted most unmercifully it was wonderful the vast variety of forms into which she threw her intellect with no continuity indeed but darting up and dancing always in a state of preternatural activitysoon sinking down as if exhausted by so rapid and feverish a tide of lifeand succeeded by other shapes of a similar wild energy it was like nothing so much as the phantasmagoric play of the northern lights in the mere exercise of the fancy however and the sportiveness of a growing mind there might be little more than was observable in other children of bright faculties except as pearl in the dearth of human playmates was thrown more upon the visionary throng which she created the singularity lay in the hostile feelings with which the child regarded all these offspring of her own heart and mind she never created a friend but seemed always to be sowing broadcast the dragon ’ s teeth whence sprung a harvest of armed enemies against whom she rushed to battle it was inexpressibly sadthen what depth of sorrow to a mother who felt in her own heart the causeto observe in one so young this constant recognition of an adverse world and so fierce a training of the energies that were to make good her cause in the contest that"

   "these two men so different in age came gradually to spend much time together for the sake of the minister ’ s health and to enable the leech to gather plants with healing balm in them they took long walks on the seashore or in the forest mingling various talk with the plash and murmur of the waves and the solemn windanthem among the treetops often likewise one was the guest of the other in his place of study and retirement there was a fascination for the minister in the company of the man of science in whom he recognized an intellectual cultivation of no moderate depth or scope together with a range and freedom of ideas that he would have vainly looked for among the members of his own profession in truth he was startled if not shocked to find this attribute in the physician mr dimmesdale was a true priest a true religionist with the reverential sentiment largely developed and an order of mind that impelled itself powerfully along the track of a creed and wore its passage continually deeper with the lapse of time in no state of society would he have been what is called a man of liberal views it would always be essential to his peace to feel the pressure of a faith about him supporting while it confined him within its iron framework not the less however though with a tremulous enjoyment did he feel the occasional relief of looking at the universe through the medium of another kind of intellect than those with which he habitually held converse it was as if a window were thrown open admitting a freer atmosphere into the close and stifled study where his life was wasting itself away amid lamplight or obstructed daybeams and the musty fragrance be it sensual or moral that exhales from books but the air was too fresh and chill to be long breathed with comfort so the minister and the physician with him withdrew again within the limits of what their church defined as orthodox thus roger chillingworth scrutinized his patient carefully both as he saw him in his ordinary life keeping an accustomed pathway in the range of thoughts familiar to him and as he appeared when thrown amidst other moral scenery the novelty of which might call out something new to the surface of his character he deemed it essential it would seem to know the man before attempting to do him good wherever there is a heart and an intellect the diseases of the physical frame are tinged with the peculiarities of these in arthur dimmesdale thought and imagination were so active and sensibility so intense that the bodily infirmity would be likely to have its groundwork there so roger chillingworththe man of skill the kind and friendly physicianstrove to go deep into his patient ’ s bosom delving among his principles prying into his recollections and probing everything with a cautious touch like a treasureseeker in a dark cavern few secrets can escape an investigator who has opportunity and license to undertake such a quest and skill to follow it up a man burdened with a secret should especially avoid the intimacy of his physician if the latter possess native sagacity and a nameless something morelet us call it intuition if he show no intrusive egotism nor disagreeably prominent characteristics of his own if he have the power which must be born with him to bring his mind into such affinity with his patient ’ s that this last shall unawares have spoken what he imagines himself only to have thought if such revelations be received without tumult and acknowledged not so often by an uttered sympathy as by silence an inarticulate breath and here and there a word to indicate that all is understood if to these qualifications of a confidant be joined the advantages afforded by his recognized character as a physicianthen at some inevitable moment will the soul of the sufferer be dissolved and flow forth in a dark but transparent stream bringing all its mysteries into the daylight roger chillingworth possessed all or most of the attributes above enumerated nevertheless time went on a kind of intimacy as we have said grew up between these two cultivated minds which had as wide a field as the whole sphere of human thought and study to meet upon they discussed every topic of ethics and religion of public affairs and private character they talked much on both sides of matters that seemed personal to themselves and yet no secret such as the physician fancied must exist there ever stole out of the minister ’ s consciousness into his companion ’ s ear the latter had his suspicions indeed that even the nature of mr dimmesdale ’ s bodily disease had never fairly been revealed to him it was a strange reserve"
