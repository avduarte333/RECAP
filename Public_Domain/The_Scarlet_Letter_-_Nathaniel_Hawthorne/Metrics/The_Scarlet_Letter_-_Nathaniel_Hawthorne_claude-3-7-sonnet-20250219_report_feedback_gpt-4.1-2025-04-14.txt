   "this personage prefigured and represented in his aspect the whole dismal severity of the puritanic code of law which it was his business to administer in its final and closest application to the offender stretching forth the official staff in his left hand he laid his right upon the shoulder of a young woman whom he thus drew forward until on the threshold of the prisondoor she repelled him by an action marked with natural dignity and force of character and stepped into the open air as if by her own free will she bore in her arms a child a baby of some three months old who winked and turned aside its little face from the too vivid light of day because its existence heretofore had brought it acquainted only with the gray twilight of a dungeon or other darksome apartment of the prison when the young womanthe mother of this childstood fully revealed before the crowd it seemed to be her first impulse to clasp the infant closely to her bosom not so much by an impulse of motherly affection as that she might thereby conceal a certain token which was wrought or fastened into her dress in a moment however wisely judging that one token of her shame would but poorly serve to hide another she took the baby on her arm and with a burning blush and yet a haughty smile and a glance that would not be abashed looked around at her townspeople and neighbors on the breast of her gown in fine red cloth surrounded with an elaborate embroidery and fantastic flourishes of goldthread appeared the letter a it was so artistically done and with so much fertility and gorgeous luxuriance of fancy that it had all the effect of a last and fitting decoration to the apparel which she wore and which was of a splendor in accordance with the taste of the age but greatly beyond what was allowed by the sumptuary regulations of the colony the young woman was tall with a figure of perfect elegance on a large scale she had dark and abundant hair so glossy that it threw off the sunshine with a gleam and a face which besides being beautiful from regularity of feature and richness of complexion had the impressiveness belonging to a marked brow and deep black eyes she was ladylike too after the manner of the feminine gentility of those days characterized by a certain state and dignity rather than by the delicate evanescent and indescribable grace which is now recognized as its indication and never had hester prynne appeared more ladylike in the antique interpretation of the term than as she issued from the prison those who had before known her and had expected to behold her dimmed and obscured by a disastrous cloud were astonished and even startled to perceive how her beauty shone out and made a halo of the misfortune and ignominy in which she was enveloped it may be true that to a sensitive observer there was something exquisitely painful in it her attire which indeed she had wrought for the occasion in prison and had modelled much after her own fancy seemed to express the attitude of her spirit the desperate recklessness of her mood by its wild and picturesque peculiarity but the point which drew all eyes and as it were transfigured the wearerso that both men and women who had been familiarly acquainted with hester prynne were now impressed as if they beheld her for the first timewas that scarlet letter so fantastically embroidered and illuminated upon her bosom it had the effect of a spell taking her out of the ordinary relations with humanity and enclosing her in a sphere"

   "on a luxuriant heap of moss which at some epoch of the preceding century had been a gigantic pine with its roots and trunk in the darksome shade and its head aloft in the upper atmosphere it was a little dell where they had seated themselves with a leafstrewn bank rising gently on either side and a brook flowing through the midst over a bed of fallen and drowned leaves the trees impending over it had flung down great branches from time to time which choked up the current and compelled it to form eddies and black depths at some points while in its swifter and livelier passages there appeared a channelway of pebbles and brown sparkling sand letting the eyes follow along the course of the stream they could catch the reflected light from its water at some short distance within the forest but soon lost all traces of it amid the bewilderment of treetrunks and underbrush and here and there a huge rock covered over with gray lichens all these giant trees and bowlders of granite seemed intent on making a mystery of the course of this small brook fearing perhaps that with its neverceasing loquacity it should whisper tales out of the heart of the old forest whence it flowed or mirror its revelations on the smooth surface of a pool continually indeed as it stole onward the streamlet kept up a babble kind quiet soothing but melancholy like the voice of a young child that was spending its infancy without playfulness and knew not how to be merry among sad acquaintance and events of sombre hue “ o brook o foolish and tiresome little brook ” cried pearl after listening awhile to its talk “ why art thou so sad pluck up a spirit and do not be all the time sighing and murmuring ” but the brook in the course of its little lifetime among the foresttrees had gone through so solemn an experience that it could not help talking about it and seemed to have nothing else to say pearl resembled the brook inasmuch as the current of her life gushed from a wellspring as mysterious and had flowed through scenes shadowed as heavily with gloom but unlike the little stream she danced and sparkled and prattled airily along her course “ what does this sad little brook say mother ” inquired she “ if thou hadst a sorrow of thine own the brook might tell thee of it ” answered her mother “ even as it is telling me of mine but now pearl i hear a footstep along the path and the noise of one putting aside the branches i would have thee betake thyself to play and leave me to speak with him that comes yonder ” “ is it the black man ” asked pearl “ wilt thou go and play child ” repeated her mother “ but do not stray far into the wood and take heed that thou come at my first call ” “ yes mother ” answered pearl “ but if it be the black man wilt thou not let me stay a moment and look at him with his big book under his arm ” “ go silly child ” said her mother impatiently “ it is no black man thou canst see him now through the trees it is the minister ” “ and so it is ” said the child “ and mother he has his hand over his heart is it because when the minister wrote his name in the book the black man set his mark in that place but why does he not wear it outside his bosom as thou dost mother ”"

   "hester prynne with a mind of native courage and activity and for so long a period not merely estranged but outlawed from society had habituated herself to such latitude of speculation as was altogether foreign to the clergyman she had wandered without rule or guidance in a moral wilderness as vast as intricate and shadowy as the untamed forest amid the gloom of which they were now holding a colloquy that was to decide their fate her intellect and heart had their home as it were in desert places where she roamed as freely as the wild indian in his woods for years past she had looked from this estranged point of view at human institutions and whatever priests or legislators had established criticising all with hardly more reverence than the indian would feel for the clerical band the judicial robe the pillory the gallows the fireside or the church the tendency of her fate and fortunes had been to set her free the scarlet letter was her passport into regions where other women dared not tread shame despair solitude these had been her teachersstern and wild onesand they had made her strong but taught her much amiss the minister on the other hand had never gone through an experience calculated to lead him beyond the scope of generally received laws although in a single instance he had so fearfully transgressed one of the most sacred of them but this had been a sin of passion not of principle nor even purpose since that wretched epoch he had watched with morbid zeal and minuteness not his actsfor those it was easy to arrangebut each breath of emotion and his every thought at the head of the social system as the clergymen of that day stood he was only the more trammelled by its regulations its principles and even its prejudices as a priest the framework of his order inevitably hemmed him in as a man who had once sinned but who kept his conscience all alive and painfully sensitive by the fretting of an unhealed wound he might have been supposed safer within the line of virtue than if he had never sinned at all thus we seem to see that as regarded hester prynne the whole seven years of outlaw and ignominy had been little other than a preparation for this very hour but arthur dimmesdale were such a man once more to fall what plea could be urged in extenuation of his crime none unless it avail him somewhat that he was broken down by long and exquisite suffering that his mind was darkened and confused by the very remorse which harrowed it that between fleeing as an avowed criminal and remaining as a hypocrite conscience might find it hard to strike the balance that it was human to avoid the peril of death and infamy and the inscrutable machinations of an enemy that finally to this poor pilgrim on his dreary and desert path faint sick miserable there appeared a glimpse of human affection and sympathy a new life and a true one in exchange for the heavy doom which he was now expiating and be the stern and sad truth spoken that the breach which guilt has once made into the human soul is never in this mortal state repaired it may be watched and guarded so that the enemy shall not force his way again into the citadel and might even in his subsequent assaults select some other avenue in preference to that where he had formerly succeeded but there is still the ruined wall and near it the stealthy tread of the foe that would win over again his unforgotten"
