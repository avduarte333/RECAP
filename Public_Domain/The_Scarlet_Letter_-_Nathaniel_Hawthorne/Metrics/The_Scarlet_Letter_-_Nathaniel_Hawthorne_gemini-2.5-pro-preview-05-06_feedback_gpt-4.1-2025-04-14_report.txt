   "the truth was that the little puritans being of the most intolerant brood that ever lived had got a vague idea of something outlandish unearthly or at variance with ordinary fashions in the mother and child and therefore scorned them in their hearts and not unfrequently reviled them with their tongues pearl felt the sentiment and requited it with the bitterest hatred that can be supposed to rankle in a childish bosom these outbreaks of a fierce temper had a kind of value and even comfort for her mother because there was at least an intelligible earnestness in the mood instead of the fitful caprice that so often thwarted her in the child ’ s manifestations it appalled her nevertheless to discern here again a shadowy reflection of the evil that had existed in herself all this enmity and passion had pearl inherited by inalienable right out of hester ’ s heart mother and daughter stood together in the same circle of seclusion from human society and in the nature of the child seemed to be perpetuated those unquiet elements that had distracted hester prynne before pearl ’ s birth but had since begun to be soothed away by the softening influences of maternity at home within and around her mother ’ s cottage pearl wanted not a wide and various circle of acquaintance the spell of life went forth from her evercreative spirit and communicated itself to a thousand objects as a torch kindles a flame wherever it may be applied the unlikeliest materialsa stick a bunch of rags a flowerwere the puppets of pearl ’ s witchcraft and without undergoing any outward change became spiritually adapted to whatever drama occupied the stage of her inner world her one babyvoice served a multitude of imaginary personages old and young to talk withal the pinetrees aged black and solemn and flinging groans and other melancholy utterances on the breeze needed little transformation to figure as puritan elders the ugliest weeds of the garden were their children whom pearl smote down and uprooted most unmercifully it was wonderful the vast variety of forms into which she threw her intellect with no continuity indeed but darting up and dancing always in a state of preternatural activitysoon sinking down as if exhausted by so rapid and feverish a tide of lifeand succeeded by other shapes of a similar wild energy it was like nothing so much as the phantasmagoric play of the northern lights in the"

   "“ i must needs look deeper into it a strange sympathy betwixt soul and body were it only for the art ’ s sake i must search this matter to the bottom ” it came to pass not long after the scene above recorded that the reverend mr dimmesdale at noonday and entirely unawares fell into a deep deep slumber sitting in his chair with a large blackletter volume open before him on the table it must have been a work of vast ability in the somniferous school of literature the profound depth of the minister ’ s repose was the more remarkable inasmuch as he was one of those persons whose sleep ordinarily is as light as fitful and as easily scared away as a small bird hopping on a twig to such an unwonted remoteness however had his spirit now withdrawn into itself that he stirred not in his chair when old roger chillingworth without any extraordinary precaution came into the room the physician advanced directly in front of his patient laid his hand upon his bosom and thrust aside the vestment that hitherto had always covered it even from the professional eye then indeed mr dimmesdale shuddered and slightly stirred after a brief pause the physician turned away but with what a wild look of wonder joy and horror with what a ghastly rapture as it were too mighty to be expressed only by the eye and features and therefore bursting forth through the whole ugliness of his figure and making itself even riotously manifest by the extravagant gestures with which he threw up his arms towards the ceiling and stamped his foot upon the floor had a man seen old roger chillingworth at that moment of his ecstasy he would have had no need to ask how satan comports himself when a precious human soul is lost to heaven and won into his kingdom but what distinguished the physician ’ s ecstasy from satan ’ s was the trait of wonder in it"

   "the founders of a new colony whatever utopia of human virtue and happiness they might originally project have invariably recognized it among their earliest practical necessities to allot a portion of the virgin soil as a cemetery and another portion as the site of a prison in accordance with this rule it may safely be assumed that the forefathers of boston had built the first prisonhouse somewhere in the vicinity of cornhill almost as seasonably as they marked out the first burialground on isaac johnson ’ s lot and round about his grave which subsequently became the nucleus of all the congregated sepulchres in the old churchyard of king ’ s chapel certain it is that some fifteen or twenty years after the settlement of the town the wooden jail was already marked with weatherstains and other indications of age which gave a yet darker aspect to its beetlebrowed and gloomy front the rust on the ponderous ironwork of its oaken door looked more antique than anything else in the new world like all that pertains to crime it seemed never to have known a youthful era before this ugly edifice and between it and the wheeltrack of the street was a grassplot much overgrown with burdock pigweed appleperu and such unsightly vegetation which evidently found something congenial in the soil that had so early borne the black flower of civilized society a prison but on one side of the portal and rooted almost at the threshold was a wild rosebush covered in this month of june with its delicate gems which might be imagined to offer their fragrance and fragile beauty to the prisoner as he went in and to the condemned criminal as he came forth to his doom in token that the deep heart of nature could pity"

   "an indian in his native garb was standing there but the red men were not so infrequent visitors of the english settlements that one of them would have attracted any notice from hester prynne at such a time much less would he have excluded all other objects and ideas from her mind by the indian ’ s side and evidently sustaining a companionship with him stood a white man clad in a strange disarray of civilized and savage costume he was small in stature with a furrowed visage which as yet could hardly be termed aged there was a remarkable intelligence in his features as of a person who had so cultivated his mental part that it could not fail to mould the physical to itself and become manifest by unmistakable tokens although by a seemingly careless arrangement of his heterogeneous garb he had endeavored to conceal or abate the peculiarity it was sufficiently evident to hester prynne that one of this man ’ s shoulders rose higher than the other again at the first instant of perceiving that thin visage and the slight deformity of the figure she pressed her infant to her bosom with so convulsive a force that the poor babe uttered another cry of pain but the mother did not seem to hear it at his arrival in the marketplace and some time before she saw him the stranger had bent his eyes on hester prynne it was carelessly at first like a man chiefly accustomed to look inward and to whom external matters are of little value and import unless they bear relation to something within his mind very soon however his look became keen and penetrative a writhing horror twisted itself across his features like a snake gliding swiftly over them and making one little"

   "was never more faithfully followed the truth seems to be however that when he casts his leaves forth upon the wind the author addresses not the many who will fling aside his volume or never take it up but the few who will understand him better than most of his schoolmates or lifemates some authors indeed do far more than this and indulge themselves in such confidential depths of revelation as could fittingly be addressed only and exclusively to the one heart and mind of perfect sympathy as if the printed book thrown at large on the wide world were certain to find out the divided segment of the writer ’ s own nature and complete his circle of existence by bringing him into communion with it it is scarcely decorous however to speak all even where we speak impersonally but as thoughts are frozen and utterance benumbed unless the speaker stand in some true relation with his audience it may be pardonable to imagine that a friend a kind and apprehensive though not the closest friend is listening to our talk and then a native reserve being thawed by this genial consciousness we may prate of the circumstances that lie around us and even of ourself but still keep the inmost me behind its veil to this extent and within these limits an author methinks may be autobiographical without violating either the reader ’ s rights or his own it will be seen likewise that this customhouse sketch has a certain propriety of a kind always recognized in literature as explaining how a large portion of the following pages came into my possession and as offering proofs of the authenticity of a narrative therein contained this in facta desire to put myself"
