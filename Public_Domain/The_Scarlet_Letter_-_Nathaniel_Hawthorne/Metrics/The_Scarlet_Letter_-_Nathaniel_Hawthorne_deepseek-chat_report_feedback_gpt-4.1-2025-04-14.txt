   "in truth nothing short of a total change of dynasty and moral code in that interior kingdom was adequate to account for the impulses now communicated to the unfortunate and startled minister at every step he was incited to do some strange wild wicked thing or other with a sense that it would be at once involuntary and intentional in spite of himself yet growing out of a profounder self than that which opposed the impulse for instance he met one of his own deacons the good old man addressed him with the paternal affection and patriarchal privilege which his venerable age his upright and holy character and his station in the church entitled him to use and conjoined with this the deep almost worshipping respect which the minister ’ s professional and private claims alike demanded never was there a more beautiful example of how the majesty of age and wisdom may comport with the obeisance and respect enjoined upon it as from a lower social rank and inferior order of endowment towards a higher now during a conversation of some two or three moments between the reverend mr dimmesdale and this excellent and hoarybearded deacon it was only by the most careful selfcontrol that the former could refrain from uttering certain blasphemous suggestions that rose into his mind respecting the communion supper he absolutely trembled and turned pale as ashes lest his tongue should wag itself in utterance of these horrible matters and plead his own consent for so doing without his having fairly given it and even with this terror in his heart he could hardly avoid laughing to imagine how the sanctified old patriarchal deacon would have been petrified by his minister ’ s impiety again another incident of the same nature hurrying along the street the reverend mr dimmesdale encountered the eldest female member of his church a most pious and exemplary old dame poor widowed lonely and with a heart as full of reminiscences about her dead husband and children and her dead friends of long ago as a burialground is full of storied gravestones yet all this which would else have been such heavy sorrow was made almost a solemn joy to her devout old soul by religious consolations and the truths of scripture wherewith she had fed herself continually for more than thirty years and since mr dimmesdale had taken her in charge the good grandam ’ s chief earthly comfortwhich unless it had been likewise a heavenly comfort could have been none at allwas to meet her pastor whether casually or of set purpose and be refreshed with a word of warm fragrant heavenbreathing gospel truth from his beloved lips into her dulled but rapturously attentive ear but on this occasion up to the moment of putting his lips to the old woman ’ s ear mr dimmesdale as the great enemy of souls would have it could recall no text of scripture nor aught else except a brief pithy and as it then appeared to him unanswerable argument against the immortality of the human soul the instilment thereof into her mind would probably have caused this aged sister to drop down dead at once as by the effect of an intensely poisonous infusion what he really did whisper the minister could never afterwards recollect there was perhaps a fortunate disorder in his utterance which failed to impart any distinct idea to the good widow ’ s comprehension or which providence interpreted after a method of its own assuredly as the minister looked back he beheld an expression of divine gratitude and ecstasy that seemed like the shine of the celestial city on her face so wrinkled and ashy pale again a third instance after parting from the old churchmember he met the youngest sister of them all it was a maiden newly wonand won by the reverend mr dimmesdale ’ s own sermon on the sabbath after his vigilto barter the transitory pleasures of the world for the heavenly hope that was to assume brighter substance as life grew dark around her and which would gild the utter gloom with final glory she was fair and pure as a lily that had bloomed in paradise the minister knew well that he was himself enshrined within the stainless sanctity of her heart which hung its snowy curtains about his image imparting to religion the warmth of love and to love a religious purity satan that afternoon had surely led the poor young girl away from her mother ’ s side and thrown her into the pathway of this sorely tempted orshall we not rather saythis lost and desperate man as she drew nigh the archfiend whispered him to condense into small compass and drop into her tender bosom a germ of evil that would be sure to blossom darkly soon and bear black fruit betimes such was his sense of power over this virgin soul trusting him as she did that the minister felt potent to blight all the field of innocence with but one wicked look and develop all its opposite with but a word sowith a mightier struggle than he had yet sustainedhe held his geneva cloak before his face and hurried onward making no sign of recognition and leaving the young sister to digest his rudeness as she might she ransacked her consciencewhich was full of harmless little matters like her pocket or her workbagand took herself to task poor thing for a thousand imaginary faults and went about her household duties with swollen eyelids the next morning before the minister had time to celebrate his victory over this last temptation he was conscious of another impulse more ludicrous and almost as horrible it waswe blush to tell itit was to stop short in the road and teach some very wicked words to a knot of little puritan children who were playing there and had but just begun to talk denying himself this freak as unworthy of his cloth he met a drunken seaman one of the ship ’ s crew from the spanish main and here since he had so valiantly forborne all other wickedness poor mr dimmesdale longed at least to shake hands with the tarry blackguard and recreate himself with a few improper jests such as dissolute sailors so abound with and a volley of good round solid satisfactory and heavendefying oaths it was not so much a better principle as partly his natural good taste and still more his buckramed habit of clerical decorum that carried him safely through the latter crisis “ what is it that haunts and tempts me thus ” cried the minister to himself at length pausing in the street and

   "it is that of the collector our gallant old general who after his brilliant military service subsequently to which he had ruled over a wild western territory had come hither twenty years before to spend the decline of his varied and honorable life the brave soldier had already numbered nearly or quite his threescore years and ten and was pursuing the remainder of his earthly march burdened with infirmities which even the martial music of his own spiritstirring recollections could do little towards lightening the step was palsied now that had been foremost in the charge it was only with the assistance of a servant and by leaning his hand heavily on the iron balustrade that he could slowly and painfully ascend the customhouse steps and with a toilsome progress across the floor attain his customary chair beside the fireplace there he used to sit gazing with a somewhat dim serenity of aspect at the figures that came and went amid the rustle of papers the administering of oaths the discussion of business and the casual talk of the office all which sounds and circumstances seemed but indistinctly to impress his senses and hardly to make their way into his inner sphere of contemplation his countenance in this repose was mild and kindly if his notice was sought an expression of courtesy and interest gleamed out upon his features proving that there was light within him and that it was only the outward medium of the intellectual lamp that obstructed the rays in their passage the closer you penetrated to the substance of his mind the sounder it appeared when no longer called upon to speak or listen either of which operations cost him an evident effort his face would briefly subside into its former not uncheerful quietude it was not painful to behold this look for though dim it had not the imbecility of decaying age the framework of his nature originally strong and massive was not yet crumbled into ruin to observe and define his character however under such disadvantages was as difficult a task as to trace out and build up anew in imagination an old fortress like ticonderoga from a view of its gray and broken ruins here and there perchance the walls may remain almost complete but elsewhere may be only a shapeless mound cumbrous with its very strength and overgrown through long years of peace and neglect with grass and alien weeds nevertheless looking at the old warrior with affectionfor slight as was the communication between us my feeling towards him like that of all bipeds and quadrupeds who knew him might not improperly be termed soi could discern the main points of his portrait it was marked with the noble and heroic qualities which showed it to be not by a mere accident but of good right that he had won a distinguished name his spirit could never i conceive have been characterized by an uneasy activity it must at any period of his life have required an impulse to set him in motion but once stirred up with obstacles to overcome and an adequate object to be attained it was not in the man to give out or fail the heat that had formerly pervaded his nature and which was not yet extinct was never of the kind that flashes and flickers in a blaze but rather a deep red glow as of iron in a furnace weight solidity firmness this was the expression of his repose even in such decay as had crept untimely over him at the period of which i speak but i could imagine even then that under some excitement which should go deeply into his consciousnessroused by a trumpetpeal loud enough to awaken all his energies that were not dead but only slumberinghe was yet capable of flinging off his infirmities like a sick man ’ s gown dropping the staff of age to seize a battlesword and starting up once more a warrior and in"
