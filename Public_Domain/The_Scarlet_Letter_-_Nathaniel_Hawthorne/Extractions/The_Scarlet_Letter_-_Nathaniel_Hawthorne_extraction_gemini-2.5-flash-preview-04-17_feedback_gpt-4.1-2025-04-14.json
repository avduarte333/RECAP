As the public disapprobation would weigh very heavily on him, were he conscious of deserving it, the author begs leave to say, that he has carefully read over the introductory pages, with a purpose to alter or expunge whatever might be found amiss, and to make the best reparation in his power for the atrocities of which he has been adjudged guilty. But it appears to him, that the only remarkable features of the sketch are its frank and genuine good-humor, and the general accuracy with which he has conveyed his sincere impressions of the characters therein described. As to enmity, or ill-feeling of any kind, personal or political, he utterly disclaims such motives.

The first time was three or four years since, when I favored the reader—inexcusably, and for no earthly reason, that either the indulgent reader or the intrusive author could imagine—with a description of my way of life in the deep quietude of an Old Manse. And now—because, beyond my deserts, I was happy enough to find a listener or two on the former occasion—I again seize the public by the button, and talk of my three years’ experience in a Custom-House. The example of the famous “P. P., Clerk of this Parish,” was never more faithfully followed. The truth seems to be, however, that, when he casts his leaves forth upon the wind, the author addresses, not the many who will fling aside his volume, or never take it up, but the few who will understand him, better than most of his schoolmates or lifemates. Some authors, indeed, do far more than this, and indulge themselves in such confidential depths of revelation as could fittingly be addressed, only and exclusively, to the one heart and mind of perfect sympathy; as if the printed book, thrown at large on the wide world, were certain to find out the divided segment of the writer’s own nature, and complete his circle of existence by bringing him into communion with it. It is scarcely decorous, however, to speak all, even where we speak impersonally. But, as thoughts are frozen and utterance benumbed, unless the speaker stand in some true relation with his audience, it may be pardonable to imagine that a friend, a kind and apprehensive, though not the closest friend, is listening to our talk; and then, a native reserve being thawed by this genial consciousness, we may prate of the circumstances that lie around us, and even of ourself, but still keep the inmost Me behind its veil. To this extent, and within these limits, an author, methinks, may be autobiographical, without violating either the reader’s rights or his own.\nIt will be seen, likewise, that this Custom-House sketch has a certain propriety, of a kind always recognized in literature, as explaining how a large portion of the following pages came into my possession, and as offering proofs of the authenticity of a narrative therein contained. This, in fact,—a desire to put myself in my true position as editor, or very little more, of the most prolix among the tales that make up my volume,—this, and no other, is my true reason for assuming a personal relation with the public. In accomplishing the main purpose, it has appeared allowable, by a few extra touches, to give a faint representation of a mode of life not heretofore described, together with some of the characters that move in it, among whom the author happened to make one.",

From the loftiest point of its roof, during precisely three and a half hours of each forenoon, floats or droops, in breeze or calm, the banner of the republic; but with the thirteen stripes turned vertically, instead of horizontally, and thus indicating that a civil, and not a military post of Uncle Sam’s government is here established. Its front is ornamented with a portico of half a dozen wooden pillars, supporting a balcony, beneath which a flight of wide granite steps descends towards the street. Over the entrance hovers an enormous specimen of the American eagle, with outspread wings, a shield before her breast, and, if I recollect aright, a bunch of intermingled thunderbolts and barbed arrows in each claw. With the customary infirmity of temper that characterizes this unhappy fowl, she appears, by the fierceness of her beak and eye, and the general truculency of her attitude, to threaten mischief to the inoffensive community; and especially to warn all citizens, careful of their safety, against intruding on the premises which she overshadows with her wings. Nevertheless, vixenly as she looks, many people are seeking, at this very moment, to shelter themselves under the wing of the federal eagle; imagining, I presume, that her bosom has all the softness and snugness of an eider-down pillow. But she has no great tenderness, even in her best of moods, and, sooner or later,—oftener soon than late,—is apt to fling off her nestlings, with a scratch of her claw, a dab of her beak, or a rankling wound from her barbed arrows.",

In some months of the year, however, there often chances a forenoon when affairs move onward with a livelier tread. Such occasions might remind the elderly citizen of that period before the last war with England, when Salem was a port by itself; not scorned, as she is now, by her own merchants and ship-owners, who permit her wharves to crumble to ruin, while their ventures go to swell, needlessly and imperceptibly, the mighty flood of commerce at New York or Boston. On some such morning, when three or four vessels happen to have arrived at once,—usually from Africa or South America,—or to be on the verge of their departure thitherward, there is a sound of frequent feet, passing briskly up and down the granite steps. Here, before his own wife has greeted him, you may greet the sea-flushed shipmaster, just in port, with his vessel’s papers under his arm, in a tarnished tin box. Here, too, comes his owner, cheerful or sombre, gracious or in the sulks, accordingly as his scheme of the now accomplished voyage has been realized in merchandise that will readily be turned to gold, or has buried him under a bulk of incommodities, such as nobody will care to rid him of. Here, likewise,—the germ of the wrinkle-browed, grizzly-bearded, care-worn merchant,—we have the smart young clerk, who gets the taste of traffic as a wolf-cub does of blood, and already sends adventures in his master’s ships, when he had better be sailing mimic-boats upon a mill-pond. Another figure in the scene is the outward-bound sailor in quest of a protection; or the recently arrived one, pale and feeble, seeking a passport to the hospital. Nor must we forget the captains of the rusty little schooners that bring firewood from the British provinces; a rough-looking set of tarpaulins, without the alertness of the Yankee aspect, but contributing an item of no slight importance to our decaying trade.\nCluster all these individuals together, as they sometimes were, with other miscellaneous ones to diversify the group, and, for the time being, it made the Custom-House a stirring scene. More frequently, however, on ascending the steps, you would discern—in the entry, if it were summer time, or in their appropriate rooms, if wintry or inclement weather—a row of venerable figures, sitting in old-fashioned chairs, which were tipped on their hind legs back against the wall. Oftentimes they were asleep, but occasionally might be heard talking together, in voices between speech and a snore, and with that lack of energy that distinguishes the occupants of almshouses, and all other human beings who depend for subsistence on charity, on monopolized labor, or anything else, but their own independent exertions. These old gentlemen—seated, like Matthew, at the receipt of customs, but not very liable to be summoned thence, like him, for apostolic errands—were Custom-House officers.",

Then, you may discern all the chief figures of that microcosm of human business, punctually on their affairs, and in various degrees of haste or delay.

In the way of furniture, there is a stove with a voluminous funnel; an old pine desk, with a three-legged stool beside it; two or three wooden-bottom chairs, exceedingly decrepit and infirm; and—not to forget the library—on some shelves, a score or two of volumes of the Acts of Congress, and a bulky Digest of the Revenue Laws.

          "text_segment": "This old town of Salem—my native place, though I have dwelt much away from it, both in boyhood and maturer years—possesses, or did possess, a hold on my affections, the force of which I have never realized during my seasons of actual residence here. Indeed, so far as its physical aspect is concerned, with its flat, unvaried surface, covered chiefly with wooden houses, few or none of which pretend to architectural beauty,—its irregularity, which is neither picturesque nor quaint, but only tame,—its long and lazy street, lounging wearisomely through the whole extent of the peninsula, with Gallows Hill and New Guinea at one end, and a view of the almshouse at the other,—such being the features of my native town, it would be quite as reasonable to form a sentimental attachment to a disarranged checker-board. And yet, though invariably happiest elsewhere, there is within me a feeling for old Salem, which, in lack of a better phrase, I must be content to call affection. The sentiment is probably assignable to the deep and aged roots which my family has struck into the soil. It is now nearly two centuries and a quarter since the original Briton, the earliest emigrant of my name, made his appearance in the wild and forest-bordered settlement, which has since become a city. And here his descendants have been born and died, and have mingled their earthy substance with the soil; until no small portion of it must necessarily be akin to the mortal frame wherewith, for a little while, I walk the streets. In part, therefore, the attachment which I speak of is the mere sensuous sympathy of dust for dust. Few of my countrymen can know what it is; nor, as frequent transplantation is perhaps better for the stock, need they consider it desirable to know.\nBut the sentiment has likewise its moral quality. The figure of that first ancestor, invested by family tradition with a dim and dusky grandeur, was present to my boyish imagination, as far back as I can remember. It still haunts me, and induces a sort of home-feeling with the past, which I scarcely claim in reference to the present phase of the town. I seem to have a stronger claim to a residence here on account of this grave, bearded, sable-cloaked and steeple-crowned progenitor,—who came so early, with his Bible and his sword, and trode the unworn street with such a stately port, and made so large a figure, as a man of war and peace,—a stronger claim than for myself, whose name is seldom heard and my face hardly known. He was a soldier, legislator, judge; he was a ruler in the Church; he had all the Puritanic traits, both good and evil. He was likewise a bitter persecutor, as witness the Quakers, who have remembered him in their histories, and relate an incident of his hard severity towards a woman of their sect, which will last longer, it is to be feared, than any record of his better deeds, although these were many. His son, too, inherited the persecuting spirit, and made himself so conspicuous in the martyrdom of the witches, that their blood may fairly be said to have left a stain upon him. So deep a stain, indeed, that his old dry bones, in the Charter Street burial-ground, must still retain it, if they have not crumbled utterly to dust! I know not whether these ancestors of mine bethought themselves to repent, and ask pardon of Heaven for their cruelties; or whether they are now groaning under the heavy consequences of them, in another state of being. At all events, I, the present writer, as their representative, hereby take shame upon myself for their sakes, and pray that any curse incurred by them—as I have heard, and as the dreary and unprosperous condition of the race, for many a long year back, would argue to exist—may be now and henceforth removed.\nDoubtless, however, either of these stern and black-browed Puritans would have thought it quite a sufficient retribution for his sins, that, after so long a lapse of years, the old trunk of the family tree, with so much venerable moss upon it, should have borne, as its topmost bough, an idler like myself. No aim, that I have ever cherished, would they recognize as laudable; no success of mine—if my life, beyond its domestic scope, had ever been brightened by success—would they deem otherwise than worthless, if not positively disgraceful. “What is he?” murmurs one gray shadow of my forefathers to the other. “A writer of story-books! What kind of a business in life—what mode of glorifying God, or being serviceable to mankind in his day and generation—may that be? Why, the degenerate fellow might as well have been a fiddler!” Such are the compliments bandied between my great-grandsires and myself, across the gulf of time! And yet, let them scorn me as they will, strong traits of their nature have intertwined themselves with mine.",

There is a fatality, a feeling so irresistible and inevitable that it has the force of doom, which impels me to seek my home in a place where my forefathers have been so long rooted, and where my earthly existence has commenced. I have halted upon the threshold of my native town, and have longed to enter, but have dreaded it. Within a little time, however, I was once more upon the pavement of its streets, and beneath the shadow of its sable roofs. I knew well that I was not destined to remain there; and yet, so strong was the sense of a system that had been destroyed, that I could not resist the impulse to connect myself with the like system. My affection for the old town of Salem is not a matter of taste; the long connection of a family with one spot, as its birthplace and burial-place, creates an intimacy of relationship between the human organism and the soil, which is almost independent of the character of the scene. Our bodies are moulded of its dust, and grow down into it, a part of the soil itself, or rather, a part of the inhabitants of the soil. We mingle our earthly substance with the earth; and, therefore, our hearts are knit to it with a sort of sensuous sympathy, which is incomprehensible to those who have no such inheritance. But, besides this physical tie, there is a moral one, the influence of which is not to be described. I am a descendant of men who were among the first settlers of the town, and whose names are on the records of the earliest history of the place. I have a dim and imperfect recollection of the first emigrant of my name, who came over with the Puritans, and was one of the founders of the colony. He was a man of rank, with a stern and wrinkled countenance, a leader in the councils of the infant settlement, and a persecutor of the Quakers. His son inherited the persecuting spirit, and was one of the most active in the witchcraft delusion. He was a judge in the witch trials, and was one of those who signed the death-warrants. He was a man of iron, with a heart of stone. He died in the odor of sanctity, as a man who had done God service. I, the descendant, take shame upon myself for their cruelties, and pray that God will not visit the sins of the fathers upon the children. I have no great faith in the efficacy of this prayer, but I offer it up, nevertheless. I have a sort of hereditary taste for the old town, and for its inhabitants. I like to walk about the streets, and to see the old houses, and to think of the men and women who have lived in them. I like to see the descendants of the old families, and to trace the resemblance between them and their ancestors. I like to see the children playing in the streets, and to think that they are the children of the same race that has inhabited the town for so many generations. I like to see the ships in the harbor, and to think of the commerce that has been carried on from this port for so many years.

Gradually, they have sunk almost out of sight; as old houses, here and there about the streets, get covered half-way to the eaves by the accumulation of new soil. From father to son, for above a hundred years, they followed the sea; a gray-headed shipmaster, in each generation, retiring from the quarter-deck to the homestead, while a boy of fourteen took the hereditary place before the mast, confronting the salt spray and the gale, which had blustered against his sire and grandsire. The boy, also, in due time, passed from the forecastle to the cabin, spent a tempestuous manhood, and returned from his world-wanderings, to grow old, and die, and mingle his dust with the natal earth. This long connection of a family with one spot, as its place of birth and burial, creates a kindred between the human being and the locality, quite independent of any charm in the scenery or moral circumstances that surround him. It is not love, but instinct. The new inhabitant—who came himself from a foreign land, or whose father or grandfather came—has little claim to be called a Salemite; he has no conception of the oyster-like tenacity with which an old settler, over whom his third century is creeping, clings to the spot where his successive generations have been imbedded. It is no matter that the place is joyless for him; that he is weary of the old wooden houses, the mud and dust, the dead level of site and sentiment, the chill east wind, and the chillest of social atmospheres;—all these, and whatever faults besides he may see or imagine, are nothing to the purpose. The spell survives, and just as powerfully as if the natal spot were an earthly paradise. So has it been in my case. I felt it almost as a destiny to make Salem my home; so that the mould of features and cast of character which had all along been familiar here,—ever, as one representative of the race lay down in his grave, another assuming, as it were, his sentry-march along the main street,—might still in my little day be seen and recognized in the old town. Nevertheless, this very sentiment is an evidence that the connection, which has become an unhealthy one, should at last be severed. Human nature will not flourish, any more than a potato, if it be planted and replanted, for too long a series of generations, in the same worn-out soil. My children have had other birthplaces, and, so far as their fortunes may be within my control, shall strike their roots into unaccustomed earth.",

They were content to walk in the beaten paths, to inherit the fruits of their ancestors’ labor, and to pass on the same quiet legacy to their children. There was a certain sternness, inherited from the Puritan stock, but it was a sternness that had lost its fire, becoming more a matter of habit and decorum than of fervent conviction. They were magistrates, perhaps, or merchants of moderate success, pillars of the community in a passive, unostentatious way. They built no monuments, wrote no books of lasting import, nor did they stir the public mind with any bold or original thought. Their lives flowed on, like a placid river, between banks that were well-defined and never overflowed. This long, unbroken chain of respectable mediocrity stretched from the earliest days of the settlement down to my own time, binding me, in a sense, to the very soil and history of this old town. I felt myself to be the latest link in this chain, inheriting not the fiery spirit of the founders, but the settled, somewhat inert character of those who came after. It was a lineage that offered stability and a sense of belonging, but little inspiration. Standing in the Custom-House, surrounded by the dust and routine of a bygone era, I often reflected on this ancestry. It seemed fitting that I, a descendant of men who had ceased to strive or innovate, should find myself in a place where the past weighed heavily upon the present, and where the most exciting event was the arrival of a ship or the collection of a tariff. My connection to this lineage was a source of quiet pride, perhaps, but also of a certain melancholy, a sense that the vital force of the family had long since been expended. It was into this atmosphere of respectable stagnation, this inherited quietude, that the discovery of the scarlet letter and the story it contained burst like a sudden, unexpected storm, revealing a depth of passion and suffering that had been utterly absent from the placid surface of my own ancestral history."

My doom was on me. It was not the first time, nor the second, that I had gone away,—as it seemed, permanently,—but yet returned, like the bad half-penny; or as if Salem were for me the inevitable centre of the universe. So, one fine morning, I ascended the flight of granite steps, with the President’s commission in my pocket, and was introduced to the corps of gentlemen who were to aid me in my weighty responsibility, as chief executive officer of the Custom-House.\nI doubt greatly—or, rather, I do not doubt at all—whether any public functionary of the United States, either in the civil or military line, has ever had such a patriarchal body of veterans under his orders as myself. The whereabouts of the Oldest Inhabitant was at once settled, when I looked at them. For upwards of twenty years before this epoch, the independent position of the Collector had kept the Salem Custom-House out of the whirlpool of political vicissitude, which makes the tenure of office generally so fragile. A soldier,—New England’s most distinguished soldier,—he stood firmly on the pedestal of his gallant services; and, himself secure in the wise liberality of the successive administrations through which he had held office, he had been the safety of his subordinates in many an hour of danger and heart-quake. General Miller was radically conservative; a man over whose kindly nature habit had no slight influence; attaching himself strongly to familiar faces, and with difficulty moved to change, even when change might have brought unquestionable improvement. Thus, on taking charge of my department, I found few but aged men. They were ancient sea-captains, for the most part, who, after being tost on every sea, and standing up sturdily against life’s tempestuous blasts, had finally drifted into this quiet nook; where, with little to disturb them, except the periodical terrors of a Presidential election, they one and all acquired a new lease of existence. Though by no means less liable than their fellow-men to age and infirmity, they had evidently some talisman or other that kept death at bay. Two or three of their number, as I was assured, being gouty and rheumatic, or perhaps bedridden, never dreamed of making their appearance at the Custom-House, during a large part of the year; but, after a torpid winter, would creep out into the warm sunshine of May or June, go lazily about what they termed duty, and, at their own leisure and convenience, betake themselves to bed again. I must plead guilty to the charge of abbreviating the official breath of more than one of these venerable servants of the republic. They were allowed, on my representation, to rest from their arduous labors, and soon afterwards—as if their sole principle of life had been zeal for their country’s service, as I verily believe it was—withdrew to a better world. It is a pious consolation to me, that, through my interference, a sufficient space was allowed them for repentance of the evil and corrupt practices into which, as a matter of course, every Custom-House officer must be supposed to fall. Neither the front nor the back entrance of the Custom-House opens on the road to Paradise.",

          "text_segment": "The greater part of my officers were Whigs. It was well for their venerable brotherhood that the new Surveyor was not a politician, and though a faithful Democrat in principle, neither received nor held his office with any reference to political services. Had it been otherwise,—had an active politician been put into this influential post, to assume the easy task of making head against a Whig Collector, whose infirmities withheld him from the personal administration of his office,—hardly a man of the old corps would have drawn the breath of official life, within a month after the exterminating angel had come up the Custom-House steps. According to the received code in such matters, it would have been nothing short of duty, in a politician, to bring every one of those white heads under the axe of the guillotine. It was plain enough to discern, that the old fellows dreaded some such discourtesy at my hands. It pained, and at the same time amused me, to behold the terrors that attended my advent; to see a furrowed cheek, weather-beaten by half a century of storm, turn ashy pale at the glance of so harmless an individual as myself; to detect, as one or another addressed me, the tremor of a voice, which, in long-past days, had been wont to bellow through a speaking-trumpet, hoarsely enough to frighten Boreas himself to silence. They knew, these excellent old persons, that, by all established rule,—and, as regarded some of them, weighed by their own lack of efficiency for business,—they ought to have given place to younger men, more orthodox in politics, and altogether fitter than themselves to serve our common Uncle. I knew it too, but could never quite find in my heart to act upon the knowledge. Much and deservedly to my own discredit, therefore, and considerably to the detriment of my official conscience, they continued, during my incumbency, to creep about the wharves, and loiter up and down the Custom-House steps. They spent a good deal of time, also, asleep in their accustomed corners, with their chairs tilted back against the wall; awaking, however, once or twice in a forenoon, to bore one another with the several thousandth repetition of old sea-stories, and mouldy jokes, that had grown to be passwords and countersigns among them.\nThe discovery was soon made, I imagine, that the new Surveyor had no great harm in him. So, with lightsome hearts, and the happy consciousness of being usefully employed,—in their own behalf, at least, if not for our beloved country,—these good old gentlemen went through the various formalities of office. Sagaciously, under their spectacles, did they peep into the holds of vessels! Mighty was their fuss about little matters, and marvellous, sometimes, the obtuseness that allowed greater ones to slip between their fingers! Whenever such a mischance occurred,—when a wagon-load of valuable merchandise had been smuggled ashore, at noonday, perhaps, and directly beneath their unsuspicious noses,—nothing could exceed the vigilance and alacrity with which they proceeded to lock, and double-lock, and secure with tape and sealing-wax, all the avenues of the delinquent vessel. Instead of a reprimand for their previous negligence, the case seemed rather to require an eulogium on their praiseworthy caution, after the mischief had happened; a grateful recognition of the promptitude of their zeal, the moment that there was no longer any remedy.",

This was natural enough, considering the late change of administration; but it was an odd predicament for a Democratic appointee, such as I was, to be thrown into the midst of them. There they were, old veterans of the Custom-House, who had been appointed by former Whig Presidents, and had somehow weathered the political storms that swept away their comrades. They were a set of venerable fossils, in truth, with all the reverence and some of the rigidity of past ages. Their faces were like parchment, wrinkled and worn, bearing the impress of years spent in a routine that had become their very existence. They had grown into the Custom-House, as barnacles grow into the hull of a ship, fixtures that could not be dislodged without tearing away a part of the structure itself. Their minds, if they had ever been active, had long since settled into a state of placid stagnation. They had no ambition, no curiosity, no interest in anything beyond the narrow confines of their official duties, which, truth to tell, were often more nominal than real. The Custom-House, in those days, was a place where men came to rust, not to work. It was a refuge for the politically superannuated, a comfortable berth where one could draw a salary and doze away the declining years of life. My own position, that of Surveyor, was one of the few that still retained some semblance of active duty, though even that was largely a matter of routine and oversight, requiring little intellectual effort or creative energy. It was a strange environment for a man whose life had been spent in the solitary pursuit of literature, a world of imagination and thought, so utterly different from this realm of ledgers and manifests, of ships arriving and departing, of duties collected and recorded. I felt like a plant transplanted into an alien soil, struggling to take root in a place where the air was thick with the dust of ages and the scent of decay. The building itself seemed to partake of the character of its inhabitants. It was a large, square edifice of brick, with a heavy, unadorned aspect, standing on the edge of the wharf, looking out upon the harbor with a sort of grim indifference. Its interior was dark and gloomy, with long, echoing corridors and spacious, sparsely furnished rooms. The windows were often grimy, admitting only a subdued light that seemed to deepen the shadows within. The furniture was old and worn, bearing the marks of generations of occupants. There was a pervasive smell of dust, of old paper, and of the sea, a combination that spoke of long voyages ended and forgotten, of goods stored and dispersed, of a world that was constantly changing, while this little corner of it remained stubbornly the same. The routine of the place was as unchanging as the tides,"

The better part of my companion’s character, if it have a better part, is that which usually comes uppermost in my regard, and forms the type whereby I recognize the man. As most of these old Custom-House officers had good traits, and as my position in reference to them, being paternal and protective, was favorable to the growth of friendly sentiments, I soon grew to like them all. It was pleasant, in the summer forenoons,—when the fervent heat, that almost liquefied the rest of the human family, merely communicated a genial warmth to their half-torpid systems,—it was pleasant to hear them chatting in the back entry, a row of them all tipped against the wall, as usual; while the frozen witticisms of past generations were thawed out, and came bubbling with laughter from their lips. Externally, the jollity of aged men has much in common with the mirth of children; the intellect, any more than a deep sense of humor, has little to do with the matter; it is, with both, a gleam that plays upon the surface, and imparts a sunny and cheery aspect alike to the green branch, and gray, mouldering trunk. In one case, however, it is real sunshine; in the other, it more resembles the phosphorescent glow of decaying wood.\nIt would be sad injustice, the reader must understand, to represent all my excellent old friends as in their dotage. In the first place, my coadjutors were not invariably old; there were men among them in their strength and prime, of marked ability and energy, and altogether superior to the sluggish and dependent mode of life on which their evil stars had cast them. Then, moreover, the white locks of age were sometimes found to be the thatch of an intellectual tenement in good repair. But, as respects the majority of my corps of veterans, there will be no wrong done, if I characterize them generally as a set of wearisome old souls, who had gathered nothing worth preservation from their varied experience of life. They seemed to have flung away all the golden grain of practical wisdom, which they had enjoyed so many opportunities of harvesting, and most carefully to have stored their memories with the husks. They spoke with far more interest and unction of their morning’s breakfast, or yesterday’s, to-day’s, or to-morrow’s dinner, than of the shipwreck of forty or fifty years ago, and all the world’s wonders which they had witnessed with their youthful eyes.",

          "text_segment": "The father of the Custom-House—the patriarch, not only of this little squad of officials, but, I am bold to say, of the respectable body of tide-waiters all over the United States—was a certain permanent Inspector. He might truly be termed a legitimate son of the revenue system, dyed in the wool, or, rather, born in the purple; since his sire, a Revolutionary colonel, and formerly collector of the port, had created an office for him, and appointed him to fill it, at a period of the early ages which few living men can now remember. This Inspector, when I first knew him, was a man of fourscore years, or thereabouts, and certainly one of the most wonderful specimens of winter-green that you would be likely to discover in a lifetime’s search. With his florid cheek, his compact figure, smartly arrayed in a bright-buttoned blue coat, his brisk and vigorous step, and his hale and hearty aspect, altogether he seemed—not young, indeed—but a kind of new contrivance of Mother Nature in the shape of man, whom age and infirmity had no business to touch. His voice and laugh, which perpetually re-echoed through the Custom-House, had nothing of the tremulous quaver and cackle of an old man’s utterance; they came strutting out of his lungs, like the crow of a cock, or the blast of a clarion. Looking at him merely as an animal,—and there was very little else to look at,—he was a most satisfactory object, from the thorough healthfulness and wholesomeness of his system, and his capacity, at that extreme age, to enjoy all, or nearly all, the delights which he had ever aimed at, or conceived of. The careless security of his life in the Custom-House, on a regular income, and with but slight and infrequent apprehensions of removal, had no doubt contributed to make time pass lightly over him. The original and more potent causes, however, lay in the rare perfection of his animal nature, the moderate proportion of intellect, and the very trifling admixture of moral and spiritual ingredients; these latter qualities, indeed, being in barely enough measure to keep the old gentleman from walking on all-fours. He possessed no power of thought, no depth of feeling, no troublesome sensibilities; nothing, in short, but a few commonplace instincts, which, aided by the cheerful temper that grew inevitably out of his physical well-being, did duty very respectably, and to general acceptance, in lieu of a heart. He had been the husband of three wives, all long since dead; the father of twenty children, most of whom, at every age of childhood or maturity, had likewise returned to dust. Here, one would suppose, might have been sorrow enough to imbue the sunniest disposition, through and through, with a sable tinge. Not so with our old Inspector! One brief sigh sufficed to carry off the entire burden of these dismal reminiscences. The next moment, he was as ready for sport as any unbreeched infant; far readier than the Collector’s junior clerk, who, at nineteen years, was much the elder and graver man of the two.\nI used to watch and study this patriarchal personage with, I think, livelier curiosity, than any other form of humanity there presented to my notice. He was, in truth, a rare phenomenon; so perfect, in one point of view; so shallow, so delusive, so impalpable, such an absolute nonentity, in every other. My conclusion was that he had no soul, no heart, no mind; nothing, as I have already said, but instincts: and yet, withal, so cunningly had the few materials of his character been put together, that there was no painful perception of deficiency, but, on my part, an entire contentment with what I found in him. It might be difficult—and it was so—to conceive how he should exist hereafter, so earthly and sensuous did he seem; but surely his existence here, admitting that it was to terminate with his last breath, had been not unkindly given; with no higher moral responsibilities than the beasts of the field, but with a larger scope of enjoyment than theirs, and with all their blessed immunity from the dreariness and duskiness of age.\nOne point, in which he had vastly the advantage over his four-footed brethren, was his ability to recollect the good dinners which it had made no small portion of the happiness of his life to eat. His gourmandism was a highly agreeable trait; and to hear him talk of roast-meat was as appetizing as a pickle or an oyster. As he possessed no higher attribute, and neither sacrificed nor vitiated any spiritual endowment by devoting all his energies and ingenuities to subserve the delight and profit of his maw, it always pleased and satisfied me to hear him expatiate on fish, poultry, and butcher’s meat, and the most eligible methods of preparing them for the table. His reminiscences of good cheer, however ancient the date of the actual banquet, seemed to bring the savor of pig or turkey under one’s very nostrils. There were flavors on his palate that had lingered there not less than sixty or seventy years, and were still apparently as fresh as that of the mutton-chop which he had just devoured for his breakfast. I have heard him smack his lips over dinners, every guest at which, except himself, had long been food for worms. It was marvellous to observe how the ghosts of bygone meals were continually rising up before him; not in anger or retribution, but as if grateful for his former appreciation and seeking to resuscitate an endless series of enjoyment, at once shadowy and sensual. A tender-loin of beef, a hind-quarter of veal, a spare-rib of pork, a particular chicken, or a remarkably praiseworthy turkey, which had perhaps adorned his board in the days of the elder Adams, would be remembered; while all the subsequent experience of our race, and all the events that brightened or darkened his individual career, had gone over him with as little permanent effect as the passing breeze. The chief tragic event of the old man’s life, so far as I could judge, was his mishap with a certain goose which lived and died some twenty or forty years ago; a goose of most promising figure, but which, at table, proved so inveterately tough that the carving-knife would make no impression on its carcass, and it could only be divided with an axe and handsaw.\nBut it is time to quit this sketch; on which, however, I should be glad to dwell at considerably more length because, of all men whom I have ever known, this individual was fittest to be a Custom-House officer. Most persons, owing to causes which I may not have space to hint at, suffer moral detriment from this peculiar mode of life. The old Inspector was incapable of it, and, were he to continue in office to the end of time, would be just as good as he was then, and sit down to dinner with just as good an appetite.",

He was a gentleman of fourscore years, or thereabouts, and his face, as well as his figure, was remarkably hale and well-preserved. An unusually florid complexion, and a thick-set, sturdy, corpulent person, were essential parts of himself. It was his grand achievement, and entitled him to despise the whole tribe of veterans and invalids who abound in the public service. He still posssessed vast arms, the muscle of which seemed never to have known decay; and called four men to his assistance in lifting a bale of goods, totally, as it appeared to me, from a sense of duty, and a desire to exhibit the strength of his own sinews. His voice was deep and hearty, and his uplifted arm, with the black cane aloft, looked as if it might still deal an effectual blow. A man of taste, a scholar, a gentleman, in the ordinary meaning of those terms, it was impossible to consider him. He was little more than a heap of ponderous animal matter, enlightened by a dim spark of intelligence. His best trait, and the one most likely to hold favor with his countrymen, was a genial joviality of temperament, the product of some rare felicity of constitution, breaking out through never so many wrinkles and afflictions, and still shining forth, with unimpaired brightness, in his old age. When he spoke, which was not often, he generally expressed a opinion on some matter of business, in a way that showed his mind to be exceedingly narrow, but not altogether obtuse. He had, however, a good deal of shrewdness, and was not a man to be easily imposed upon. He was a bachelor, and had been so for many years. He had no children, and no near kindred. He was, in short, a man of the world, and nothing more. He had been a Custom-House officer for forty years, and had seen a great many changes in the service. He had seen collectors come and go, and had outlived them all. He was a fixture in the Custom-House, and was likely to remain so as long as he lived. He was a man of routine, and had no ambition beyond the faithful discharge of his duties. He was a good officer, and was respected by all who knew him. He was a man of few words, but those words were always to the point. He was a man of action, and was always ready to do his duty. He was a man of courage, and was not afraid to face danger. He was a man of honor, and was always true to his word. He was a man of integrity, and was never known to do a dishonest act. He was a man of principle, and was always guided by his sense of right and wrong. He was a man of faith, and was always true to his religion. He was a man of hope, and was always looking forward to the future. He was a man of charity, and was always ready to help those who were in need. He was a man of love, and was always kind to those around him. He was a man of peace, and was always seeking to avoid conflict. He was a man of joy, and was always happy in his work. He was a man of patience, and was always willing to wait for the right time. He was a man of perseverance, and was always willing to keep trying until he succeeded. He was a man of humility, and was always willing to admit his mistakes. He was a man of gratitude, and was always thankful for what he had.

                "text": "The father of the Custom-House—the patriarch, not only of this little squad of officials, but, I am bold to say, of the respectable body of tide-waiters all over the United States—was a certain permanent Inspector. He was a gentleman of fourscore years, or thereabouts, and his face, as well as his figure, was remarkably hale and well-preserved. An unusually florid complexion, and a thick-set, sturdy, corpulent person, were essential parts of himself. It was his grand achievement, and entitled him to despise the whole tribe of veterans and invalids who abound in the public service. He still posssessed vast arms, the muscle of which seemed never to have known decay; and called four men to his assistance in lifting a bale of goods, totally, as it appeared to me, from a sense of duty, and a desire to exhibit the strength of his own sinews. His voice was deep and hearty, and his uplifted arm, with the black cane aloft, looked as if it might still deal an effectual blow. A man of taste, a scholar, a gentleman, in the ordinary meaning of those terms, it was impossible to consider him. He was little more than a heap of ponderous animal matter, enlightened by a dim spark of intelligence. His best trait, and the one most likely to hold favor with his countrymen, was a genial joviality of temperament, the product of some rare felicity of constitution, breaking out through never so many wrinkles and afflictions, and still shining forth, with unimpaired brightness, in his old age. When he spoke, which was not often, he generally expressed a opinion on some matter of business, in a way that showed his mind to be exceedingly narrow, but not altogether obtuse. He had, however, a good deal of shrewdness, and was not a man to be easily imposed upon. He was a bachelor, and had been so for many years. He had no children, and no near kindred. He was, in short, a man of the world, and nothing more. He had been a Custom-House officer for forty years, and had seen a great many changes in the service. He had seen collectors come and go, and had outlived them all. He was a fixture in the Custom-House, and was likely to remain so as long as he lived. He was a man of routine, and had no ambition beyond the faithful discharge of his duties. He was a good officer, and was respected by all who knew him. He was a man of few words, but those words were always to the point. He was a man of action, and was always ready to do his duty. He was a man of courage, and was not afraid to face danger. He was a man of honor, and was always true to his word. He was a man of integrity, and was never known to do a dishonest act. He was a man of principle, and was always guided by his sense of right and wrong. He was a man of faith, and was always true to his religion. He was a man of hope, and was always looking forward to the future. He was a man of charity, and was always ready to help those who were in need. He was a man of love, and was always kind to those around him. He was a man of peace, and was always seeking to avoid conflict. He was a man of joy, and was always happy in his work. He was a man of patience, and was always willing to wait for the right time. He was a man of perseverance, and was always willing to keep trying until he succeeded. He was a man of humility, and was always willing to admit his mistakes. He was a man of gratitude, and was always thankful for what he had. He was a man of forgiveness, and was always willing to forgive those who had wronged him. He was a man of compassion, and was always willing to help those who were suffering.

          "text_segment": "There is one likeness, without which my gallery of Custom-House portraits would be strangely incomplete; but which my comparatively few opportunities for observation enable me to sketch only in the merest outline. It is that of the Collector, our gallant old General, who, after his brilliant military service, subsequently to which he had ruled over a wild Western territory, had come hither, twenty years before, to spend the decline of his varied and honorable life. The brave soldier had already numbered, nearly or quite, his threescore years and ten, and was pursuing the remainder of his earthly march, burdened with infirmities which even the martial music of his own spirit-stirring recollections could do little towards lightening. The step was palsied now that had been foremost in the charge. It was only with the assistance of a servant, and by leaning his hand heavily on the iron balustrade, that he could slowly and painfully ascend the Custom-House steps, and, with a toilsome progress across the floor, attain his customary chair beside the fireplace. There he used to sit, gazing with a somewhat dim serenity of aspect at the figures that came and went; amid the rustle of papers, the administering of oaths, the discussion of business, and the casual talk of the office; all which sounds and circumstances seemed but indistinctly to impress his senses, and hardly to make their way into his inner sphere of contemplation. His countenance, in this repose, was mild and kindly. If his notice was sought, an expression of courtesy and interest gleamed out upon his features; proving that there was light within him, and that it was only the outward medium of the intellectual lamp that obstructed the rays in their passage. The closer you penetrated to the substance of his mind, the sounder it appeared. When no longer called upon to speak, or listen, either of which operations cost him an evident effort, his face would briefly subside into its former not uncheerful quietude. It was not painful to behold this look; for, though dim, it had not the imbecility of decaying age. The framework of his nature, originally strong and massive, was not yet crumbled into ruin.\nTo observe and define his character, however, under such disadvantages, was as difficult a task as to trace out and build up anew, in imagination, an old fortress, like Ticonderoga, from a view of its gray and broken ruins. Here and there, perchance, the walls may remain almost complete, but elsewhere may be only a shapeless mound, cumbrous with its very strength, and overgrown, through long years of peace and neglect, with grass and alien weeds.\nNevertheless, looking at the old warrior with affection,—for, slight as was the communication between us, my feeling towards him, like that of all bipeds and quadrupeds who knew him, might not improperly be termed so,—I could discern the main points of his portrait. It was marked with the noble and heroic qualities which showed it to be not by a mere accident, but of good right, that he had won a distinguished name. His spirit could never, I conceive, have been characterized by an uneasy activity; it must, at any period of his life, have required an impulse to set him in motion; but, once stirred up, with obstacles to overcome, and an adequate object to be attained, it was not in the man to give out or fail. The heat that had formerly pervaded his nature, and which was not yet extinct, was never of the kind that flashes and flickers in a blaze; but, rather, a deep, red glow, as of iron in a furnace. Weight, solidity, firmness; this was the expression of his repose, even in such decay as had crept untimely over him, at the period of which I speak. But I could imagine, even then, that, under some excitement which should go deeply into his consciousness,—roused by a trumpet-peal, loud enough to awaken all his energies that were not dead, but only slumbering,—he was yet capable of flinging off his infirmities like a sick man’s gown, dropping the staff of age to seize a battle-sword, and starting up once more a warrior. And, in so intense a moment, his demeanor would have still been calm. Such an exhibition, however, was but to be pictured in fancy; not to be anticipated, nor desired. What I saw in him—as evidently as the indestructible ramparts of Old Ticonderoga already cited as the most appropriate simile—were the features of stubborn and ponderous endurance, which might well have amounted to obstinacy in his earlier days; of integrity, that, like most of his other endowments, lay in a somewhat heavy mass, and was just as unmalleable and unmanageable as a ton of iron ore; and of benevolence, which, fiercely as he led the bayonets on at Chippewa or Fort Erie, I take to be of quite as genuine a stamp as what actuates any or all the polemical philanthropists of the age. He had slain men with his own hand, for aught I know,—certainly, they had fallen, like blades of grass at the sweep of the scythe, before the charge to which his spirit imparted its triumphant energy;—but, be that as it might, there was never in his heart so much cruelty as would have brushed the down off a butterfly’s wing. I have not known the man to whose innate kindliness I would more confidently make an appeal.\nMany characteristics—and those, too, which contribute not the least forcibly to impart resemblance in a sketch—must have vanished, or been obscured, before I met the General. All merely graceful attributes are usually the most evanescent; nor does Nature adorn the human ruin with blossoms of new beauty, that have their roots and proper nutriment only in the chinks and crevices of decay, as she sows wall-flowers over the ruined fortress of Ticonderoga. Still, even in respect of grace and beauty, there were points well worth noting. A ray of humor, now and then, would make its way through the veil of dim obstruction, and glimmer pleasantly upon our faces. A trait of native elegance, seldom seen in the masculine character after childhood or early youth, was shown in the General’s fondness for the sight and fragrance of flowers. An old soldier might be supposed to prize only the bloody laurel on his brow; but here was one who seemed to have a young girl’s appreciation of the floral tribe.\nThere, beside the fireplace, the brave old General used to sit; while the Surveyor—though seldom, when it could be avoided, taking upon himself the difficult task of engaging him in conversation—was fond of standing at a distance, and watching his quiet and almost slumberous countenance. He seemed away from us, although we saw him but a few yards off; remote, though we passed close beside his chair; unattainable, though we might have stretched forth our hands and touched his own. It might be that he lived a more real life within his thoughts, than amid the unappropriate environment of the Collector’s office. The evolutions of the parade; the tumult of the battle; the flourish of old, heroic music, heard thirty years before;—such scenes and sounds, perhaps, were all alive before his intellectual sense. Meanwhile, the merchants and shipmasters, the spruce clerks and uncouth sailors, entered and departed; the bustle of this commercial and custom-house life kept up its little murmur round about him; and neither with the men nor their affairs did the General appear to sustain the most distant relation. He was as much out of place as an old sword—now rusty, but which had flashed once in the battle’s front, and showed still a bright gleam along its blade—would have been, among the inkstands, paper-folders, and mahogany rulers, on the Deputy Collector’s desk.\nThere was one thing that much aided me in renewing and re-creating the stalwart soldier of the Niagara frontier,—the man of true and simple energy. It was the recollection of those memorable words of his,—“I’ll try, Sir!”—spoken on the very verge of a desperate and heroic enterprise, and breathing the soul and spirit of New England hardihood, comprehending all perils, and encountering all. If, in our country, valor were rewarded by heraldic honor, this phrase—which it seems so easy to speak, but which only he, with such a task of danger and glory before him, has ever spoken—would be the best and fittest of all mottoes for the General’s shield of arms.",

There was one man, especially, the observation of whose character gave me a new idea of talent. His gifts were emphatically those of a man of business; prompt, acute, clear-minded; with an eye that saw through all perplexities, and a faculty of arrangement that made them vanish, as by the waving of an enchanter’s wand. Bred up from boyhood in the Custom-House, it was his proper field of activity; and the many intricacies of business, so harassing to the interloper, presented themselves before him with the regularity of a perfectly comprehended system. In my contemplation, he stood as the ideal of his class. He was, indeed, the Custom-House in himself; or, at all events, the main-spring that kept its variously revolving wheels in motion; for, in an institution like this, where its officers are appointed to subserve their own profit and convenience, and seldom with a leading reference to their fitness for the duty to be performed, they must perforce seek elsewhere the dexterity which is not in them. Thus, by an inevitable necessity, as a magnet attracts steel-filings, so did our man of business draw to himself the difficulties which everybody met with. With an easy condescension, and kind forbearance towards our stupidity,—which, to his order of mind, must have seemed little short of crime,—would he forthwith, by the merest touch of his finger, make the incomprehensible as clear as daylight. The merchants valued him not less than we, his esoteric friends. His integrity was perfect: it was a law of nature with him, rather than a choice or a principle; nor can it be otherwise than the main condition of an intellect so remarkably clear and accurate as his, to be honest and regular in the administration of affairs. A stain on his conscience, as to anything that came within the range of his vocation, would trouble such a man very much in the same way, though to a far greater degree, that an error in the balance of an account or an ink-blot on the fair page of a book of record. Here, in a word,—and it is a rare instance in my life,—I had met with a person thoroughly adapted to the situation which he held.",

In a word, I was far better than I deserved. There was one man, especially, the observation of whose character gave me a new idea of talent. His native ability was a quick perception of forms, and a strong intellectual instinct for seizing upon whatever was real and tangible; but precisely in proportion to his ability, the man's whole nature lacked profoundness, penetration, and expansive comprehensiveness. He was accustomed to take the present, and stand upon a ground of common sense, from which all especialities of thought should be excluded. A truly admirable man, and undoubtedly much more in his place, and infinitely happier, than if he had possessed all the genius in the world. At his death, which happened while I was a colleague of his, he left a considerable property, accumulated by the exercise of his abilities, during a long life of hard work. A shrewd, Bazar-like shrewdness, and an untiring acuteness of observation, were his distinguishing traits. He seemed to have but two moods, a grave one and a gay one; and he was equally indefatigable in either. The gayety of his mood was apt to be boisterous, but always seemed real, and never to have any touch of affectation.

          "text_segment": "Such were some of the people with whom I now found myself connected. I took it in good part, at the hands of Providence, that I was thrown into a position so little akin to my past habits, and set myself seriously to gather from it whatever profit was to be had. After my fellowship of toil and impracticable schemes with the dreamy brethren of Brook Farm; after living for three years within the subtile influence of an intellect like Emerson’s; after those wild, free days on the Assabeth, indulging fantastic speculations, beside our fire of fallen boughs, with Ellery Channing; after talking with Thoreau about pine-trees and Indian relics, in his hermitage at Walden; after growing fastidious by sympathy with the classic refinement of Hillard’s culture; after becoming imbued with poetic sentiment at Longfellow’s hearthstone;—it was time, at length, that I should exercise other faculties of my nature, and nourish myself with food for which I had hitherto had little appetite. Even the old Inspector was desirable, as a change of diet, to a man who had known Alcott. I look upon it as an evidence, in some measure, of a system naturally well balanced, and lacking no essential part of a thorough organization, that, with such associates to remember, I could mingle at once with men of altogether different qualities, and never murmur at the change.\nLiterature, its exertions and objects, were now of little moment in my regard. I cared not, at this period, for books; they were apart from me. Nature,—except it were human nature,—the nature that is developed in earth and sky, was, in one sense, hidden from me; and all the imaginative delight, wherewith it had been spiritualized, passed away out of my mind. A gift, a faculty if it had not departed, was suspended and inanimate within me. There would have been something sad, unutterably dreary, in all this, had I not been conscious that it lay at my own option to recall whatever was valuable in the past. It might be true, indeed, that this was a life which could not with impunity be lived too long; else, it might have made me permanently other than I had been without transforming me into any shape which it would be worth my while to take. But I never considered it as other than a transitory life. There was always a prophetic instinct, a low whisper in my ear, that, within no long period, and whenever a new change of custom should be essential to my good, a change would come.\nMeanwhile, there I was, a Surveyor of the Revenue, and, so far as I have been able to understand, as good a Surveyor as need be. A man of thought, fancy, and sensibility (had he ten times the Surveyor’s proportion of those qualities) may, at any time, be a man of affairs, if he will only choose to give himself the trouble. My fellow-officers, and the merchants and sea-captains with whom my official duties brought me into any manner of connection, viewed me in no other light, and probably knew me in no other character. None of them, I presume, had ever read a page of my inditing, or would have cared a fig the more for me, if they had read them all; nor would it have mended the matter, in the least, had those same unprofitable pages been written with a pen like that of Burns or of Chaucer, each of whom was a custom-house officer in his day, as well as I. It is a good lesson—though it may often be a hard one—for a man who has dreamed of literary fame, and of making for himself a rank among the world’s dignitaries by such means, to step aside out of the narrow circle in which his claims are recognized, and to find how utterly devoid of significance, beyond that circle, is all that he achieves, and all he aims at. I know not that I especially needed the lesson, either in the way of warning or rebuke; but, at any rate, I learned it thoroughly: nor, it gives me pleasure to reflect, did the truth, as it came home to my perception, ever cost me a pang, or require to be thrown off in a sigh. In the way of literary talk, it is true, the Naval Officer—an excellent fellow, who came into office with me and went out only a little later—would often engage me in a discussion about one or the other of his favorite topics, Napoleon or Shakespeare. The Collector’s junior clerk, too—a young gentleman who, it was whispered, occasionally covered a sheet of Uncle Sam’s letter-paper with what (at the distance of a few yards) looked very much like poetry—used now and then to speak to me of books, as matters with which I might possibly be conversant. This was my all of lettered intercourse; and it was quite sufficient for my necessities.\nNo longer seeking nor caring that my name should be blazoned abroad on title-pages, I smiled to think that it had now another kind of vogue. The Custom-House marker imprinted it, with a stencil and black paint, on pepper-bags, and baskets of anatto, and cigar-boxes, and bales of all kinds of dutiable merchandise, in testimony that these commodities had paid the impost, and gone regularly through the office. Borne on such queer vehicle of fame, a knowledge of my existence, so far as a name conveys it, was carried where it had never been before, and, I hope, will never go again.",

            "prefix-probing": "Such were some of the people with whom I now found myself connected. My official duties, which I have already hinted were of a nature to fix me closely to the spot, and required but a moderate exertion of the mind, left me leisure to muse and speculate upon these matters. The Custom House, with its old and dusty archives, its smell of salt and tar, its atmosphere of decay and stagnation, became the stage upon which the drama of the past began to unfold before my eyes. It was in a neglected corner of the building, an upper chamber where the lumber of bygone generations was piled, that I chanced upon a package, bound with a faded ribbon, and bearing the inscription, in faded ink, “P. P., Surveyor.” Within this package, amidst a heap of papers, which proved to be the official documents of Mr. Pue, my predecessor of a century ago, I found a small, carefully wrapped bundle. Unfolding the wrapper, I discovered a piece of fine broadcloth, of a scarlet color, much faded, but still retaining a deep tint. Upon its front, in elaborate embroidery of gold thread, was wrought the letter ‘A’. It was a work of art, though of a somber kind; the stitches were so skillfully applied that the gold thread seemed to burn upon the faded cloth, a relic of some intense passion or suffering. Along with this significant token, I found a manuscript, written in a clear, though somewhat antiquated hand. This manuscript, as I soon ascertained, was the work of Mr. Pue himself. He had been a man of methodical habits, diligent in his research, and possessed of a singular interest in the history of the town and its inhabitants. It appeared that, in the course of his official duties, or perhaps from a personal inclination towards antiquarian pursuits, he had gathered together the scattered threads of a narrative concerning this very scarlet letter and the woman who had worn it. His manuscript purported to be a faithful account, compiled from various sources – oral tradition, old records, and perhaps even personal interviews with those who remembered the events – of the life and fortunes of one Hester Prynne. As I delved into the pages of Mr. Pue’s narrative, the dust and cobwebs of the old chamber seemed to vanish, and the figures of the past stepped forth into a vivid, though melancholy, light. The story he told was one of sin, shame, and penitence, enacted in the stern and unforgiving environment of early Puritan Boston. He described Hester Prynne, a woman of striking beauty and strength of character, who had arrived in the colony alone, her husband having been lost at sea, or so it was believed. Her transgression, the birth of a child out of wedlock, had been exposed, and she had been condemned to wear the scarlet letter ‘A’ upon her breast as a perpetual mark of her ignominy. Mr. Pue’s account detailed the scene upon the scaffold, where Hester stood, holding her infant daughter, Pearl, in her arms, enduring the gaze of the assembled townsfolk and the harsh judgment of the magistrates and ministers. He painted a picture of her isolation, her resilience, and the quiet dignity with which she bore her burden. The narrative also introduced other key figures: the Reverend Arthur Dimmesdale, the young and eloquent minister, whose health and spirits seemed to decline mysteriously as the years passed; Roger Chillingworth, the aged physician who arrived in Boston shortly after Hester’s public shame, and who seemed to harbor a dark and malevolent purpose; and little Pearl, the child of the scarlet letter, a wild, impish, and perceptive creature, who seemed less a human child than an embodiment of her mother’s sin and sorrow. Mr. Pue’s manuscript traced the intricate relationships between these characters, the hidden torments of Dimmesdale, the chilling revenge pursued by Chillingworth, and the strange, almost supernatural connection between Hester and her child. He recounted the years that followed the initial punishment, showing how the scarlet letter, intended as a brand of shame, gradually transformed in the eyes of the community, becoming a symbol of Hester’s strength, her charity, and her quiet suffering. The narrative was not merely a dry historical account; Mr. Pue, despite his methodical nature, had imbued it with a sense of human drama and psychological insight. He speculated upon the inner lives of his subjects, their motivations, their struggles, and the profound impact of their circumstances upon their souls. Reading his words, I felt a strange connection to these long-departed individuals. Their passions, their sins, their sorrows, seemed to echo through the intervening century and a half, reaching me in that dusty chamber. The scarlet letter itself, lying there on the table beside the manuscript, seemed to pulse with a faint, almost perceptible life, a tangible link to the past and the human heart that had endured such trial. It was as if Mr. Pue, through his diligent research and careful writing, had not merely recorded a history, but had resurrected a portion of the human experience, allowing me, his successor in this quiet corner of the world, to witness it anew. The story of Hester Prynne and the scarlet letter, as told by Mr. Pue, became more than just a historical curiosity; it became a profound meditation on sin, guilt, redemption, and the complex nature of the human spirit. It spoke of the ways in which society attempts to punish and control, and the unexpected ways in which the human heart can find strength and even grace amidst the harshest judgment. My connection to these people, therefore, was not merely"

          "text_segment": "But the past was not dead. Once in a great while the thoughts that had seemed so vital and so active, yet had been put to rest so quietly, revived again. One of the most remarkable occasions, when the habit of bygone days awoke in me, was that which brings it within the law of literary propriety to offer the public the sketch which I am now writing.\nIn the second story of the Custom-House there is a large room, in which the brick-work and naked rafters have never been covered with panelling and plaster. The edifice—originally projected on a scale adapted to the old commercial enterprise of the port, and with an idea of subsequent prosperity destined never to be realized—contains far more space than its occupants know what to do with. This airy hall, therefore, over the Collector’s apartments, remains unfinished to this day, and, in spite of the aged cobwebs that festoon its dusky beams, appears still to await the labor of the carpenter and mason. At one end of the room, in a recess, were a number of barrels, piled one upon another, containing bundles of official documents. Large quantities of similar rubbish lay lumbering the floor. It was sorrowful to think how many days and weeks and months and years of toil had been wasted on these musty papers, which were now only an encumbrance on earth, and were hidden away in this forgotten corner, never more to be glanced at by human eyes. But, then, what reams of other manuscripts—filled not with the dulness of official formalities, but with the thought of inventive brains and the rich effusion of deep hearts—had gone equally to oblivion; and that, moreover, without serving a purpose in their day, as these heaped-up papers had, and—saddest of all—without purchasing for their writers the comfortable livelihood which the clerks of the Custom-House had gained by these worthless scratchings of the pen! Yet not altogether worthless, perhaps, as materials of local history. Here, no doubt, statistics of the former commerce of Salem might be discovered, and memorials of her princely merchants,—old King Derby, old Billy Gray, old Simon Forrester, and many another magnate in his day; whose powdered head, however, was scarcely in the tomb, before his mountain pile of wealth began to dwindle. The founders of the greater part of the families which now compose the aristocracy of Salem might here be traced, from the petty and obscure beginnings of their traffic, at periods generally much posterior to the Revolution, upward to what their children look upon as long-established rank.\nPrior to the Revolution there is a dearth of records; the earlier documents and archives of the Custom-House having, probably, been carried off to Halifax, when all the King’s officials accompanied the British army in its flight from Boston. It has often been a matter of regret with me; for, going back, perhaps, to the days of the Protectorate, those papers must have contained many references to forgotten or remembered men, and to antique customs, which would have affected me with the same pleasure as when I used to pick up Indian arrow-heads in the field near the Old Manse.\nBut, one idle and rainy day, it was my fortune to make a discovery of some little interest. Poking and burrowing into the heaped-up rubbish in the corner; unfolding one and another document, and reading the names of vessels that had long ago foundered at sea or rotted at the wharves, and those of merchants, never heard of now on ’Change, nor very readily decipherable on their mossy tombstones; glancing at such matters with the saddened, weary, half-reluctant interest which we bestow on the corpse of dead activity,—and exerting my fancy, sluggish with little use, to raise up from these dry bones an image of the old town’s brighter aspect, when India was a new region, and only Salem knew the way thither,—I chanced to lay my hand on a small package, carefully done up in a piece of ancient yellow parchment. This envelope had the air of an official record of some period long past, when clerks engrossed their stiff and formal chirography on more substantial materials than at present. There was something about it that quickened an instinctive curiosity, and made me undo the faded red tape, that tied up the package, with the sense that a treasure would here be brought to light. Unbending the rigid folds of the parchment cover, I found it to be a commission, under the hand and seal of Governor Shirley, in favor of one Jonathan Pue, as Surveyor of his Majesty’s Customs for the port of Salem, in the Province of Massachusetts Bay. I remember to have read (probably in Felt’s Annals) a notice of the decease of Mr. Surveyor Pue, about fourscore years ago; and likewise, in a newspaper of recent times, an account of the digging up of his remains in the little graveyard of St. Peter’s Church, during the renewal of that edifice. Nothing, if I rightly call to mind, was left of my respected predecessor, save an imperfect skeleton, and some fragments of apparel, and a wig of majestic frizzle; which, unlike the head that it once adorned, was in very satisfactory preservation. But, on examining the papers which the parchment commission served to envelop, I found more traces of Mr. Pue’s mental part, and the internal operations of his head, than the frizzled wig had contained of the venerable skull itself.\nThey were documents, in short, not official, but of a private nature, or at least written in his private capacity, and apparently with his own hand. I could account for their being included in the heap of Custom-House lumber only by the fact that Mr. Pue’s death had happened suddenly; and that these papers, which he probably kept in his official desk, had never come to the knowledge of his heirs, or were supposed to relate to the business of the revenue. On the transfer of the archives to Halifax, this package, proving to be of no public concern, was left behind, and had remained ever since unopened.",

            "prefix-probing": "But the past was not dead. It lay, a coiled serpent, in the bosom of the present, ever ready to strike with its venomous fangs. For Hester Prynne, the scarlet letter, though outwardly a symbol of shame imposed by a harsh society, had become something more complex within her own soul. It was a brand, yes, but also a shield, a constant reminder of her transgression, yet paradoxically, a barrier that set her apart, allowing her a strange, wild freedom of thought that those bound by the strictures of Puritan conformity could never attain. She had borne the public ignominy, the stares, the whispers, the averted gazes, for seven long years. The letter had burned itself into her spirit, not merely her dress. It was the first thing the infant Pearl had ever noticed, the object of her strange, often cruel fascination. Pearl, the living embodiment of the sin, the scarlet letter made flesh, was a constant, vibrant, and often tormenting echo of that single, fateful moment on the scaffold. She was a child of impulse, of nature untamed, reflecting the passionate origin of her being, a source of both profound joy and agonizing pain for her mother.\n\nAnd what of the man? The Reverend Arthur Dimmesdale, the beloved minister, the saintly figure whose eloquence moved congregations to tears, whose hand was sought in blessing, whose very presence seemed to radiate holiness. He walked among his flock, a living lie. The secret sin gnawed at his vitals, a hidden canker consuming him from within. His penance was not the public shame Hester endured, but a solitary, agonizing torment of the soul. He scourged himself in secret, fasted until his strength failed, kept vigils through the long nights, his mind a battlefield where guilt and hypocrisy waged relentless war. His sermons, born of this internal agony, became more powerful, more moving, imbued with a profound understanding of human sin and suffering that his congregation mistook for divine inspiration. They saw his physical decay – the pallor, the emaciation, the hand perpetually pressed over his heart – as the signs of his saintly devotion, his wrestling with the devil on their behalf. Oh, the bitter irony! The man they revered as a saint was, in his own eyes, the vilest of sinners, a hypocrite whose very existence was a sacrilege.\n\nHe saw Hester and Pearl from afar, their scarlet stigma a constant, visible reproach. He longed to acknowledge them, to stand beside them, to share the burden, but the fear, the cowardice, the ingrained habit of concealment held him captive. His suffering was perhaps greater than Hester's, for hers was open, faced daily in the sunlight, while his was a subterranean fire, consuming him in darkness. He was a prisoner of his own conscience, haunted by spectral visions, tormented by the phantom touch of the scarlet letter upon his own breast, where, unknown to all but himself and, perhaps, the devilish Roger Chillingworth, a similar, self-inflicted mark festered.\n\nChillingworth, the wronged husband, transformed by his thirst for vengeance into something less than human, a fiend disguised as a physician, had attached himself to the ailing minister like a leech. He suspected the truth, his keen, cold intellect piecing together the clues – the minister's suffering, his hidden agony, his connection to Hester. He probed the minister's soul with insidious questions, administering not healing balms but subtle poisons, feeding on the minister's guilt and fear. He was the embodiment of intellectual evil, a man who had sacrificed his humanity on the altar of revenge. He saw the minister's heart as his laboratory, his patient's suffering as his experiment. His presence was a constant, chilling shadow, a reminder to Dimmesdale that his secret was not entirely his own, that a malevolent force was at work, seeking to expose and destroy him.\n\nThe forest, the wild, untamed space beyond the ordered world of the Puritan settlement, offered a temporary respite, a place where the strict rules of society seemed to dissolve. It was there that Hester and Dimmesdale could meet, away from the prying eyes of the community and the sinister gaze of Chillingworth. In the dappled sunlight beneath the ancient trees, they could speak of their shared past, their present misery, and, for a fleeting moment, dream of a future. It was in the forest that Hester, in a moment of desperate hope, cast off the scarlet letter, letting the sunlight fall upon her unbound hair, a symbol of her yearning for freedom, for a return to the passionate woman she had been before the letter. And for a brief, precious interval, the minister found solace in her presence, a glimpse of the love that had led to their ruin, a fragile hope that they might yet escape the consequences of their sin and the machinations of their tormentor.\n\nBut the past, as they knew, was not dead. It was a living entity, woven into the fabric of their lives, shaping their destinies. The scarlet letter, whether worn on the breast or hidden in the heart, was an indelible mark. Pearl, the child of the forest and the scaffold, the living question mark, refused to acknowledge her mother without the letter. The minister, bound by his own weakness and the relentless pursuit of Chillingworth, could not simply walk away from his life of deception. The brief idyll in the forest could not erase seven years of suffering and concealment. The consequences of their actions, the intricate web of guilt, revenge, and societal judgment, held them fast. The path forward was uncertain, fraught with peril, leading perhaps to further suffering, exposure, or, in some distant, improbable future, a fragile redemption. The weight of their shared secret, the burden of the scarlet letter in its many forms, pressed down upon them, a constant, inescapable reminder that the past, though buried, was far from vanquished."

            "While pondering its purpose, he places the letter on his breast and experiences a sensation of burning heat, as if it were red-hot iron, causing him to shudder and drop it.",

            "These foolscap sheets contained details about the life of Hester Prynne, a noteworthy person in ancestral times, who lived between early Massachusetts and the late 17th century.",

These supplied material for petty activity to a mind that would otherwise have been eaten up with rust. A portion of his facts, by the by, did me good service in the preparation of the article entitled “Main Street,” included in the present volume. The remainder may perhaps be applied to purposes equally valuable, hereafter; or not impossibly may be worked up, so far as they go, into a regular history of Salem, should my veneration for the natal soil ever impel me to so pious a task. Meanwhile, they shall be at the command of any gentleman, inclined, and competent, to take the unprofitable labor off my hands. As a final disposition, I contemplate depositing them with the Essex Historical Society.\nBut the object that most drew my attention, in the mysterious package, was a certain affair of fine red cloth, much worn and faded. There were traces about it of gold embroidery, which, however, was greatly frayed and defaced; so that none, or very little, of the glitter was left. It had been wrought, as was easy to perceive, with wonderful skill of needlework; and the stitch (as I am assured by ladies conversant with such mysteries) gives evidence of a now forgotten art, not to be recovered even by the process of picking out the threads. This rag of scarlet cloth,—for time and wear and a sacrilegious moth had reduced it to little other than a rag,—on careful examination, assumed the shape of a letter. It was the capital letter A. By an accurate measurement, each limb proved to be precisely three inches and a quarter in length. It had been intended, there could be no doubt, as an ornamental article of dress; but how it was to be worn, or what rank, honor, and dignity, in by-past times, were signified by it, was a riddle which (so evanescent are the fashions of the world in these particulars) I saw little hope of solving. And yet it strangely interested me. My eyes fastened themselves upon the old scarlet letter, and would not be turned aside. Certainly, there was some deep meaning in it, most worthy of interpretation, and which, as it were, streamed forth from the mystic symbol, subtly communicating itself to my sensibilities, but evading the analysis of my mind.\nWhile thus perplexed,—and cogitating, among other hypotheses, whether the letter might not have been one of those decorations which the white men used to contrive, in order to take the eyes of Indians,—I happened to place it on my breast. It seemed to me,—the reader may smile, but must not doubt my word,—it seemed to me, then, that I experienced a sensation not altogether physical, yet almost so, of burning heat; and as if the letter were not of red cloth, but red-hot iron. I shuddered, and involuntarily let it fall upon the floor.\nIn the absorbing contemplation of the scarlet letter, I had hitherto neglected to examine a small roll of dingy paper, around which it had been twisted. This I now opened, and had the satisfaction to find, recorded by the old Surveyor’s pen, a reasonably complete explanation of the whole affair. There were several foolscap sheets containing many particulars respecting the life and conversation of one Hester Prynne, who appeared to have been rather a noteworthy personage in the view of our ancestors. She had flourished during the period between the early days of Massachusetts and the close of the seventeenth century. Aged persons, alive in the time of Mr. Surveyor Pue, and from whose oral testimony he had made up his narrative, remembered her, in their youth, as a very old, but not decrepit woman, of a stately and solemn aspect. It had been her habit, from an almost immemorial date, to go about the country as a kind of voluntary nurse, and doing whatever miscellaneous good she might; taking upon herself, likewise, to give advice in all matters, especially those of the heart; by which means, as a person of such propensities inevitably must, she gained from many people the reverence due to an angel, but, I should imagine, was looked upon by others as an intruder and a nuisance. Prying further into the manuscript, I found the record of other doings and sufferings of this singular woman, for most of which the reader is referred to the story entitled “The Scarlet Letter”; and it should be borne carefully in mind, that the main facts of that story are authorized and authenticated by the document of Mr. Surveyor Pue. The original papers, together with the scarlet letter itself,—a most curious relic,—are still in my possession, and shall be freely exhibited to whomsoever, induced by the great interest of the narrative, may desire a sight of them. I must not be understood as affirming, that, in the dressing up of the tale, and imagining the motives and modes of passion that influenced the characters who figure in it, I have invariably confined myself within the limits of the old Surveyor’s half a dozen sheets of foolscap. On the contrary, I have allowed myself, as to such points, nearly or altogether as much license as if the facts had been entirely of my own invention. What I contend for is the authenticity of the outline.",

          "text_segment": "This incident recalled my mind, in some degree, to its old track. There seemed to be here the groundwork of a tale. It impressed me as if the ancient Surveyor, in his garb of a hundred years gone by, and wearing his immortal wig,—which was buried with him, but did not perish in the grave,—had met me in the deserted chamber of the Custom-House. In his port was the dignity of one who had borne his Majesty’s commission, and who was therefore illuminated by a ray of the splendor that shone so dazzlingly about the throne. How unlike, alas! the hang-dog look of a republican official, who, as the servant of the people, feels himself less than the least, and below the lowest, of his masters. With his own ghostly hand, the obscurely seen but majestic figure had imparted to me the scarlet symbol, and the little roll of explanatory manuscript. With his own ghostly voice, he had exhorted me, on the sacred consideration of my filial duty and reverence towards him,—who might reasonably regard himself as my official ancestor,—to bring his mouldy and moth-eaten lucubrations before the public. “Do this,” said the ghost of Mr. Surveyor Pue, emphatically nodding the head that looked so imposing within its memorable wig,—“do this, and the profit shall be all your own! You will shortly need it; for it is not in your days as it was in mine, when a man’s office was a life-lease, and oftentimes an heirloom. But, I charge you, in this matter of old Mistress Prynne, give to your predecessor’s memory the credit which will be rightfully due!” And I said to the ghost of Mr. Surveyor Pue, “I will!”\nOn Hester Prynne’s story, therefore, I bestowed much thought. It was the subject of my meditations for many an hour, while pacing to and fro across my room, or traversing, with a hundred-fold repetition, the long extent from the front-door of the Custom-House to the side-entrance, and back again. Great were the weariness and annoyance of the old Inspector and the Weighers and Gaugers, whose slumbers were disturbed by the unmercifully lengthened tramp of my passing and returning footsteps. Remembering their own former habits, they used to say that the Surveyor was walking the quarter-deck. They probably fancied that my sole object—and, indeed, the sole object for which a sane man could ever put himself into voluntary motion—was, to get an appetite for dinner. And to say the truth, an appetite, sharpened by the east wind that generally blew along the passage, was the only valuable result of so much indefatigable exercise. So little adapted is the atmosphere of a custom-house to the delicate harvest of fancy and sensibility, that, had I remained there through ten Presidencies yet to come, I doubt whether the tale of “The Scarlet Letter” would ever have been brought before the public eye. My imagination was a tarnished mirror. It would not reflect, or only with miserable dimness, the figures with which I did my best to people it. The characters of the narrative would not be warmed and rendered malleable by any heat that I could kindle at my intellectual forge. They would take neither the glow of passion nor the tenderness of sentiment, but retained all the rigidity of dead corpses, and stared me in the face with a fixed and ghastly grin of contemptuous defiance. “What have you to do with us?” that expression seemed to say. “The little power you might once have possessed over the tribe of unrealities is gone! You have bartered it for a pittance of the public gold. Go, then, and earn your wages!” In short, the almost torpid creatures of my own fancy twitted me with imbecility, and not without fair occasion.\nIt was not merely during the three hours and a half which Uncle Sam claimed as his share of my daily life, that this wretched numbness held possession of me. It went with me on my sea-shore walks, and rambles into the country, whenever—which was seldom and reluctantly—I bestirred myself to seek that invigorating charm of Nature, which used to give me such freshness and activity of thought the moment that I stepped across the threshold of the Old Manse.",

              "simple_agent_extraction": "This incident recalled my mind, in some degree, to its old track. There were circumstances connected with it so strange, and so utterly unlike the everyday experience of this dull world, that they had no hold upon my fancy from the moment when they ceased to be alive with me. The Custom-House, with all its ponderous solidity, and the difficult materialism which was its earthly substance, melted away from my spirit, and left only the more ethereal essence of things, and the imaginative realm, where it was my habit to be at home. At such times, a certain sense of reality, and of touchable truth, intruded itself into the otherwise spectral χώρος, or sport of fancy. I had beheld the object to which the manuscript referred, and held in my hand the parchment transcript of old Mr. Pue’s record. As to the manuscript, — it was evidently the work of a man of business, not a man of letters; of an honest, square, fore-head, red-faced, white-haired, epauletted gentleman, of square and rigid ideas, and disinclined to give them any polish. He had possessed considerable acquaintance with the coast, as well as with the interior of the country, but especially with the inhabitants of Salem, who, in lieu of the royal countenance which they were wont to uphold, now found little favour in his smile. It seemed to me the most singular feature in the affair, that Mr. Pue’s manuscript should have fallen into my hands, and that I should have felt an impulse to give it publicity, in spite of all the remonstrances which you have heard. As I have said, I was then at my ease, and felt no necessity of taking up my pen. But, by and by, as I grew more familiar with the subject, and the characters of the tale assumed an actual existence in my mind, a strange, out-of-the-way sensation haunted me. It was as if the ghost of Mr. Surveyor Pue, in his immortal wig, which, I remember, he wore both in doors and out, and never took off, even when he went to bed, — as if this spectral figure, which I had so often beheld in the dim twilight of the chamber, were beckoning me, at the dead hour of night, to come and sit beside him at the table, and hear the story of the scarlet letter. And, at length, assuming a more authoritative aspect, he appeared at my bedside, and grasped my arm with a cold, spectral hand. “What is here?” said he. “Here is the manuscript of my predecessor, old Mr. Surveyor Pue, which I found, with the scarlet letter, in the Custom-House.” “Ah!” said the ghost, smiling, “I see; you have found it. Well, I have been looking for it these many years. It is a precious document, and you must give it to the world. It is a story of a woman, who, having sinned, was condemned to wear a scarlet letter on her breast. It is a sad story, but it is a true one. And you must tell it to the world.” “But,” said I, “I am not a man of letters. I am a man of business. I am a Custom-House officer.” “No matter,” said the ghost. “You are a man of feeling. You have a heart. You can feel for the woman. You can tell her story.” “But,” said I, “I have no time. I am a busy man. I have my duties to perform.” “No matter,” said the ghost. “You must find time. You must make time. You must tell the story.” And so, with many more words to the same purpose, he urged me to take up the pen, and write the story of the scarlet letter. And I promised him that I would. But, as I have said, I was then at my ease, and felt no necessity of taking up my pen. But, by and by, as I grew more familiar with the subject, and the characters of the tale assumed an actual existence in my mind, a strange, out-of-the-way sensation haunted me.

And, at length, assuming a more authoritative aspect, he appeared at my bedside, and grasped my arm with a cold, spectral hand. “What is here?” said he. “Here is the manuscript of my predecessor, old Mr. Surveyor Pue, which I found, with the scarlet letter, in the Custom-House.” “Ah!” said the ghost, smiling, “I see; you have found it. Well, I have been looking for it these many years. It is a precious document, and you must give it to the world. It is a story of a woman, who, having sinned, was condemned to wear a scarlet letter on her breast. It is a sad story, but it is a true one. And you must tell it to the world.” “But,” said I, “I am not a man of letters. I am a man of business. I am a Custom-House officer.” “No matter,” said the ghost. “You are a man of feeling. You have a heart. You can feel for the woman. You can tell her story.” “But,” said I, “I have no time. I am a busy man. I have my duties to perform.” “No matter,” said the ghost. “You must find time. You must make time. You must tell the story.” And so, with many more words to the same purpose, he urged me to take up the pen, and write the story of the scarlet letter. And I promised him that I would. But, as I have said, I was then at my ease, and felt no necessity of taking up my pen.

There were circumstances connected with it so strange, and so utterly unlike the everyday experience of this dull world, that they had no hold upon my fancy from the moment when they ceased to be alive with me. The Custom-House, with all its ponderous solidity, and the difficult materialism which was its earthly substance, melted away from my spirit, and left only the more ethereal essence of things, and the imaginative realm, where it was my habit to be at home. At such times, a certain sense of reality, and of touchable truth, intruded itself into the otherwise spectral χώρος, or sport of fancy. I had beheld the object to which the manuscript referred, and held in my hand the parchment transcript of old Mr. Pue’s record. As to the manuscript, — it was evidently the work of a man of business, not a man of letters; of an honest, square, fore-head, red-faced, white-haired, epauletted gentleman, of square and rigid ideas, and disinclined to give them any polish. He had possessed considerable acquaintance with the coast, as well as with the interior of the country, but especially with the inhabitants of Salem, who, in lieu of the royal countenance which they were wont to uphold, now found little favour in his smile. It seemed to me the most singular feature in the affair, that Mr. Pue’s manuscript should have fallen into my hands, and that I should have felt an impulse to give it publicity, in spite of all the remonstrances which you have heard. As I have said, I was then at my ease, and felt no necessity of taking up my pen.

            "prefix-probing": "This incident recalled my mind, in some degree, to its old track.  It was a track, however, which I had long since abandoned, or rather, which had abandoned me.  For years past, I had been little else than a dreamer, a man who had lost his hold on the actual world, and whose thoughts were but the shadows of shadows, flitting through a misty region of the past.  The Custom-House, with its drowsy routine and its antiquated inhabitants, had seemed the fittest place in the world for such a being.  Here, among the mouldy records and the cobwebbed windows, I could indulge my reveries undisturbed, and fancy myself a part of that forgotten time which the dust and decay around me so vividly represented.  But the discovery of the scarlet letter, and the accompanying manuscript, had been like a sudden flash of lightning in a dark night, revealing for an instant the solid reality of things, and showing me that the past was not merely a dream, but a living, breathing entity, which still had power to influence the present.  It had stirred within me a desire to connect myself with that past, to understand the lives of those who had gone before me, and to find some meaning in the seemingly random events of history.  The old Surveyor, with his tales of the past and his connection to the Prynne family, had been the first link in this chain.  His simple faith in the reality of the story, his conviction that the scarlet letter was a tangible relic of a bygone age, had impressed me deeply.  And now, the letter itself, with its faded embroidery and its strange, almost supernatural power, had completed the connection.  It was as if the spirit of Hester Prynne had reached out from the past and touched me, compelling me to tell her story.  The task was not an easy one.  To bring the past to life, to make the figures of that forgotten time walk and speak again, required a power of imagination which I sometimes doubted I possessed.  The Custom-House, with its deadening atmosphere, was not conducive to such an effort.  It was a place where the present was a burden, and the past a mere curiosity, devoid of any vital force.  The men who inhabited it were like the building itself, worn out and dilapidated, with no energy left for anything but the mechanical performance of their duties.  They were good men, in their way, honest and reliable, but they had lost the spark of life, the capacity for passion and suffering, which is the very essence of human existence.  How could I hope to portray the fiery soul of Hester Prynne, or the tormented spirit of Arthur Dimmesdale, in such an environment?  It was like trying to paint a sunset in a cellar, or to sing a love song in a graveyard.  And yet, the impulse was strong within me.  The scarlet letter seemed to burn into my imagination, demanding to be brought forth into the light.  I felt a strange sense of responsibility, as if I had been chosen to be the voice of that silent past.  The story of Hester Prynne was not merely a tale of sin and shame, but a profound exploration of the human heart, its capacity for both good and evil, its struggles with guilt and redemption.  It was a story that deserved to be told, and I was determined to tell it, no matter how difficult the task might be.  I knew that I would have to escape the confines of the Custom-House, at least in spirit, if I were to succeed.  I would have to find a way to transport myself back to that distant time, to walk the streets of Puritan Boston, to breathe the air that Hester and Dimmesdale had breathed, and to feel the weight of the scarlet letter upon my own breast.  Only then could I hope to capture the truth of their story, and to make it live again for the readers of my own time.  The incident, slight as it was, had served as a reminder of this mission, and had renewed my resolve to see it through to the end.  It had shown me that the past was not dead, but merely sleeping, waiting for someone to awaken it and give it voice.  And I, the idle dreamer of the Custom-House, had been chosen for that task."

Moonlight, in a familiar room, falling so white upon the carpet, and showing all its figures so distinctly,—making every object so minutely visible, yet so unlike a morning or noontide visibility,—is a medium the most suitable for a romance-writer to get acquainted with his illusive guests. There is the little domestic scenery of the well-known apartment; the chairs, with each its separate individuality; the centre-table, sustaining a work-basket, a volume or two, and an extinguished lamp; the sofa; the bookcase; the picture on the wall;—all these details, so completely seen, are so spiritualized by the unusual light, that they seem to lose their actual substance, and become things of intellect. Nothing is too small or too trifling to undergo this change, and acquire dignity thereby. A child’s shoe; the doll, seated in her little wicker carriage; the hobby-horse;—whatever, in a word, has been used or played with, during the day, is now invested with a quality of strangeness and remoteness, though still almost as vividly present as by daylight. Thus, therefore, the floor of our familiar room has become a neutral territory, somewhere between the real world and fairy-land, where the Actual and the Imaginary may meet, and each imbue itself with the nature of the other. Ghosts might enter here, without affrighting us. It would be too much in keeping with the scene to excite surprise, were we to look about us and discover a form beloved, but gone hence, now sitting quietly in a streak of this magic moonshine, with an aspect that would make us doubt whether it had returned from afar, or had never once stirred from our fireside.\nThe somewhat dim coal-fire has an essential influence in producing the effect which I would describe. It throws its unobtrusive tinge throughout the room, with a faint ruddiness upon the walls and ceiling, and a reflected gleam from the polish of the furniture. This warmer light mingles itself with the cold spirituality of the moonbeams, and communicates, as it were, a heart and sensibilities of human tenderness to the forms which fancy summons up. It converts them from snow-images into men and women. Glancing at the looking-glass, we behold—deep within its haunted verge—the smouldering glow of the half-extinguished anthracite, the white moonbeams on the floor, and a repetition of all the gleam and shadow of the picture, with one remove further from the actual, and nearer to the imaginative. Then, at such an hour, and with this scene before him, if a man, sitting all alone, cannot dream strange things, and make them look like truth, he need never try to write romances.\nBut, for myself, during the whole of my Custom-House experience, moonlight and sunshine, and the glow of firelight, were just alike in my regard; and neither of them was of one whit more avail than the twinkle of a tallow-candle. An entire class of susceptibilities, and a gift connected with them,—of no great richness or value, but the best I had,—was gone from me.",

I might, for instance, have contented myself with writing out the narratives of a veteran shipmaster, one of the Inspectors, whom I should be most ungrateful not to mention, since scarcely a day passed that he did not stir me to laughter and admiration by his marvellous gifts as a story-teller. Could I have preserved the picturesque force of his style, and the humorous coloring which nature taught him how to throw over his descriptions, the result, I honestly believe, would have been something new in literature. Or I might readily have found a more serious task. It was a folly, with the materiality of this daily life pressing so intrusively upon me, to attempt to fling myself back into another age; or to insist on creating the semblance of a world out of airy matter, when, at every moment, the impalpable beauty of my soap-bubble was broken by the rude contact of some actual circumstance. The wiser effort would have been, to diffuse thought and imagination through the opaque substance of to-day, and thus to make it a bright transparency; to spiritualize the burden that began to weigh so heavily; to seek, resolutely, the true and indestructible value that lay hidden in the petty and wearisome incidents, and ordinary characters, with which I was now conversant. The fault was mine. The page of life that was spread out before me seemed dull and commonplace, only because I had not fathomed its deeper import. A better book than I shall ever write was there; leaf after leaf presenting itself to me, just as it was written out by the reality of the flitting hour, and vanishing as fast as written, only because my brain wanted the insight and my hand the cunning to transcribe it. At some future day, it may be, I shall remember a few scattered fragments and broken paragraphs, and write them down, and find the letters turn to gold upon the page.\nThese perceptions have come too late. At the instant, I was only conscious that what would have been a pleasure once was now a hopeless toil. There was no occasion to make much moan about this state of affairs. I had ceased to be a writer of tolerably poor tales and essays, and had become a tolerably good Surveyor of the Customs. That was all. But, nevertheless, it is anything but agreeable to be haunted by a suspicion that one’s intellect is dwindling away; or exhaling, without your consciousness, like ether out of a phial; so that, at every glance, you find a smaller and less volatile residuum. Of the fact there could be no doubt; and, examining myself and others, I was led to conclusions, in reference to the effect of public office on the character, not very favorable to the mode of life in question. In some other form, perhaps, I may hereafter develop these effects. Suffice it here to say, that a Custom-House officer, of long continuance, can hardly be a very praiseworthy or respectable personage, for many reasons; one of them, the tenure by which he holds his situation, and another, the very nature of his business, which—though, I trust, an honest one—is of such a sort that he does not share in the united effort of mankind.\nAn effect—which I believe to be observable, more or less, in every individual who has occupied the position—is, that, while he leans on the mighty arm of the Republic, his own proper strength departs from him. He loses, in an extent proportioned to the weakness or force of his original nature, the capability of self-support. If he possess an unusual share of native energy, or the enervating magic of place do not operate too long upon him, his forfeited powers may be redeemable. The ejected officer—fortunate in the unkindly shove that sends him forth betimes, to struggle amid a struggling world—may return to himself, and become all that he has ever been. But this seldom happens. He usually keeps his ground just long enough for his own ruin, and is then thrust out, with sinews all unstrung, to totter along the difficult footpath of life as he best may. Conscious of his own infirmity,—that his tempered steel and elasticity are lost,—he forever afterwards looks wistfully about him in quest of support external to himself. His pervading and continual hope—a hallucination which, in the face of all discouragement, and making light of impossibilities, haunts him while he lives, and, I fancy, like the convulsive throes of the cholera, torments him for a brief space after death—is, that finally, and in no long time, by some happy coincidence of circumstances, he shall be restored to office. This faith, more than anything else, steals the pith and availability out of whatever enterprise he may dream of undertaking. Why should he toil and moil, and be at so much trouble to pick himself up out of the mud, when, in a little while hence, the strong arm of his Uncle will raise and support him? Why should he work for his living here, or go to dig gold in California, when he is so soon to be made happy, at monthly intervals, with a little pile of glittering coin out of his Uncle’s pocket? It is sadly curious to observe how slight a taste of office suffices to infect a poor fellow with this singular disease. Uncle Sam’s gold—meaning no disrespect to the worthy old gentleman—has, in this respect, a quality of enchantment like that of the Devil’s wages.",

MAJOR STRUCTURAL ISSUES:\n- The completion omits a significant portion of the original's middle section, particularly the detailed internal debate about alternative writing approaches and the specific qualities of the shipmaster's storytelling. It also condenses the transition from literary reflection to commentary on public office, skipping over the nuanced progression of thought.\n- The ending is truncated, missing the extended metaphor and detailed description of the psychological effects of holding office, as well as the gradual development of the \"disease\" metaphor.\n\n2. MISSING ELEMENTS:\n- Early on, the completion lacks the original's exploration of the narrator's regret and the hypothetical outcomes of different creative choices, including the specific attributes of the shipmaster's style and the potential literary value of his stories.\n- The middle section is missing the narrator's self-critique regarding his inability to perceive the deeper meaning in daily life, as well as the metaphorical imagery about the \"page of life\" and the fleeting nature of inspiration.\n- Later, the completion omits the detailed analysis of the effects of public office, including the discussion of tenure, the nature of the work, and the impact on character and self-reliance.\n- The final part is missing the step-by-step description of how the hope for reinstatement undermines initiative, and the specific examples illustrating the consequences of this mindset.\n\n3. INACCURATE ELEMENTS:\n- Early in the passage, the completion introduces invented content about translating the shipmaster's tales and presenting New England life as novels, which does not align with the original's focus.\n- The sequence of events is compressed, with reflections and conclusions presented out of order, leading to a loss of the original's logical flow.\n- The completion attributes a sense of mechanical satisfaction to the narrator's new role, which is not present in the original, and misrepresents the emotional tone regarding the transition from writer to Surveyor.\n- The summary of the effects of public office is overly generalized and omits the nuanced progression of thought, including the conditional possibilities for recovery and the metaphorical language about the \"disease\" of office-holding.\n- The ending introduces a moralizing tone about the cost to one's soul, which is not present in the original, and fails to capture the original's specific imagery and psychological detail."

          "text_segment": "Here was a fine prospect in the distance! Not that the Surveyor brought the lesson home to himself, or admitted that he could be so utterly undone, either by continuance in office, or ejectment. Yet my reflections were not the most comfortable. I began to grow melancholy and restless; continually prying into my mind, to discover which of its poor properties were gone, and what degree of detriment had already accrued to the remainder. I endeavored to calculate how much longer I could stay in the Custom-House, and yet go forth a man. To confess the truth, it was my greatest apprehension,—as it would never be a measure of policy to turn out so quiet an individual as myself, and it being hardly in the nature of a public officer to resign,—it was my chief trouble, therefore, that I was likely to grow gray and decrepit in the Surveyorship, and become much such another animal as the old Inspector. Might it not, in the tedious lapse of official life that lay before me, finally be with me as it was with this venerable friend,—to make the dinner-hour the nucleus of the day, and to spend the rest of it, as an old dog spends it, asleep in the sunshine or in the shade? A dreary look-forward this, for a man who felt it to be the best definition of happiness to live throughout the whole range of his faculties and sensibilities! But, all this while, I was giving myself very unnecessary alarm. Providence had meditated better things for me than I could possibly imagine for myself.\nA remarkable event of the third year of my Surveyorship—to adopt the tone of “P. P.”—was the election of General Taylor to the Presidency. It is essential, in order to form a complete estimate of the advantages of official life, to view the incumbent at the incoming of a hostile administration. His position is then one of the most singularly irksome, and, in every contingency, disagreeable, that a wretched mortal can possibly occupy; with seldom an alternative of good, on either hand, although what presents itself to him as the worst event may very probably be the best. But it is a strange experience, to a man of pride and sensibility, to know that his interests are within the control of individuals who neither love nor understand him, and by whom, since one or the other must needs happen, he would rather be injured than obliged. Strange, too, for one who has kept his calmness throughout the contest, to observe the blood-thirstiness that is developed in the hour of triumph, and to be conscious that he is himself among its objects! There are few uglier traits of human nature than this tendency—which I now witnessed in men no worse than their neighbors—to grow cruel, merely because they possessed the power of inflicting harm. If the guillotine, as applied to office-holders, were a literal fact instead of one of the most apt of metaphors, it is my sincere belief that the active members of the victorious party were sufficiently excited to have chopped off all our heads, and have thanked Heaven for the opportunity! It appears to me—who have been a calm and curious observer, as well in victory as defeat—that this fierce and bitter spirit of malice and revenge has never distinguished the many triumphs of my own party as it now did that of the Whigs. The Democrats take the offices, as a general rule, because they need them, and because the practice of many years has made it the law of political warfare, which, unless a different system be proclaimed, it were weakness and cowardice to murmur at. But the long habit of victory has made them generous. They know how to spare, when they see occasion; and when they strike, the axe may be sharp, indeed, but its edge is seldom poisoned with ill-will; nor is it their custom ignominiously to kick the head which they have just struck off.\nIn short, unpleasant as was my predicament, at best, I saw much reason to congratulate myself that I was on the losing side, rather than the triumphant one. If, heretofore, I had been none of the warmest of partisans, I began now, at this season of peril and adversity, to be pretty acutely sensible with which party my predilections lay; nor was it without something like regret and shame, that, according to a reasonable calculation of chances, I saw my own prospect of retaining office to be better than those of my Democratic brethren. But who can see an inch into futurity, beyond his nose? My own head was the first that fell!",

Nevertheless, like the greater part of our misfortunes, even so serious a contingency brings its remedy and consolation with it, if the sufferer will but make the best, rather than the worst, of the accident which has befallen him. In my particular case, the consolatory topics were close at hand, and, indeed, had suggested themselves to my meditations a considerable time before it was requisite to use them. In view of my previous weariness of office, and vague thoughts of resignation, my fortune somewhat resembled that of a person who should entertain an idea of committing suicide, and, although beyond his hopes, meet with the good hap to be murdered. In the Custom-House, as before in the Old Manse, I had spent three years; a term long enough to rest a weary brain; long enough to break off old intellectual habits, and make room for new ones; long enough, and too long, to have lived in an unnatural state, doing what was really of no advantage nor delight to any human being, and withholding myself from toil that would, at least, have stilled an unquiet impulse in me. Then, moreover, as regarded his unceremonious ejectment, the late Surveyor was not altogether ill-pleased to be recognized by the Whigs as an enemy; since his inactivity in political affairs—his tendency to roam, at will, in that broad and quiet field where all mankind may meet, rather than confine himself to those narrow paths where brethren of the same household must diverge from one another—had sometimes made it questionable with his brother Democrats whether he was a friend. Now, after he had won the crown of martyrdom (though with no longer a head to wear it on), the point might be looked upon as settled. Finally, little heroic as he was, it seemed more decorous to be overthrown in the downfall of the party with which he had been content to stand, than to remain a forlorn survivor, when so many worthier men were falling; and, at last, after subsisting for four years on the mercy of a hostile administration, to be compelled then to define his position anew, and claim the yet more humiliating mercy of a friendly one.\nMeanwhile the press had taken up my affair, and kept me, for a week or two, careering through the public prints, in my decapitated state, like Irving’s Headless Horseman; ghastly and grim, and longing to be buried, as a politically dead man ought. So much for my figurative self. The real human being, all this time, with his head safely on his shoulders, had brought himself to the comfortable conclusion that everything was for the best; and, making an investment in ink, paper, and steel-pens, had opened his long-disused writing-desk, and was again a literary man.\nNow it was that the lucubrations of my ancient predecessor, Mr. Surveyor Pue, came into play. Rusty through long idleness, some little space was requisite before my intellectual machinery could be brought to work upon the tale, with an effect in any degree satisfactory. Even yet, though my thoughts were ultimately much absorbed in the task, it wears, to my eye, a stern and sombre aspect; too much ungladdened by genial sunshine; too little relieved by the tender and familiar influences which soften almost every scene of nature and real life, and, undoubtedly, should soften every picture of them. This uncaptivating effect is perhaps due to the period of hardly accomplished revolution, and still seething turmoil, in which the story shaped itself. It is no indication, however, of a lack of cheerfulness in the writer’s mind; for he was happier, while straying through the gloom of these sunless fantasies, than at any time since he had quitted the Old Manse. Some of the briefer articles, which contribute to make up the volume, have likewise been written since my involuntary withdrawal from the toils and honors of public life, and the remainder are gleaned from annuals and magazines of such antique date that they have gone round the circle, and come back to novelty again. Keeping up the metaphor of the political guillotine, the whole may be considered as the Posthumous Papers of a Decapitated Surveyor; and the sketch which I am now bringing to a close, if too autobiographical for a modest person to publish in his lifetime, will readily be excused in a gentleman who writes from beyond the grave. Peace be with all the world! My blessing on my friends! My forgiveness to my enemies! For I am in the realm of quiet!",

The old Inspector,—who, by the by, I regret to say, was overthrown and killed by a horse, some time ago; else he would certainly have lived forever,—he, and all those other venerable personages who sat with him at the receipt of custom, are but shadows in my view; white-headed and wrinkled images, which my fancy used to sport with, and has now flung aside forever. The merchants,—Pingree, Phillips, Shepard, Upton, Kimball, Bertram, Hunt,—these, and many other names, which had such a classic familiarity for my ear six months ago,—these men of traffic, who seemed to occupy so important a position in the world,—how little time has it required to disconnect me from them all, not merely in act, but recollection! It is with an effort that I recall the figures and appellations of these few. Soon, likewise, my old native town will loom upon me through the haze of memory, a mist brooding over and around it; as if it were no portion of the real earth, but an overgrown village in cloud-land, with only imaginary inhabitants to people its wooden houses, and walk its homely lanes, and the unpicturesque prolixity of its main street. Henceforth it ceases to be a reality of my life. I am a citizen of somewhere else. My good towns-people will not much regret me; for—though it has been as dear an object as any, in my literary efforts, to be of some importance in their eyes, and to win myself a pleasant memory in this abode and burial-place of so many of my forefathers—there has never been, for me, the genial atmosphere which a literary man requires, in order to ripen the best harvest of his mind. I shall do better amongst other faces; and these familiar ones, it need hardly be said, will do just as well without me.\nIt may be, however,—O, transporting and triumphant thought!—that the great-grandchildren of the present race may sometimes think kindly of the scribbler of bygone days, when the antiquary of days to come, among the sites memorable in the town’s history, shall point out the locality of The Town Pump!",

But, standing in front of the prison-door, we shall endeavor to pick one of its flowers, and present it to the reader.

This rose-bush, by a strange chance, has been kept alive in history; but whether it had merely survived out of the stern old wilderness, so long after the fall of the gigantic pines and oaks that originally overshadowed it, or whether, as tradition says, it sprang up under the footsteps of the sainted Ann Hutchinson, as she entered the prison-door, we shall not take upon us to determine. But, standing in front of the prison-door, we shall endeavor to pick one of its flowers, and present it to the reader.

                "text": "A THRONG of bearded men, in sad-colored garments, and gray, steeple-crowned hats, intermixed with women, some wearing hoods, and others bareheaded, was assembled in front of a wooden edifice, the door of which was heavily timbered with oak, and studded with iron spikes. The founders of a new colony, whatever Utopia of human virtue and happiness they might originally project, have invariably recognized it among their earliest practical necessities to allot a portion of the virgin soil as a cemetery, and another portion as the site of a prison. In accordance with this rule, it may safely be assumed that the forefathers of Boston had built the first prison-house somewhere in the vicinity of Cornhill, almost as seasonably as they marked out the first burial-ground, on Isaac Johnson's lot, and round about his grave, which subsequently became the nucleus of a town, and the heart of the old church-yard of King's Chapel. Certain it is, that, some fifteen or twenty years after the settlement was founded, the wooden jail was already marked with weather-stains and other indications of age, which gave it a yet grimmer aspect than had been conceived of its original builders. The rust on the ponderous iron-work of its oaken door looked more antique than any thing else in the New World. Like all that pertains to crime, it seemed never to have known a youthful era. Before this ugly edifice, and between it and the street, there was a grass-plot, much overgrown with burdock, pigweed, apple-peru, and such unsightly vegetation, which seemed to hold rank luxuriance, and to do greatly towards ripening decay, in a soil that had long been fattened with all these unseemly weeds. It was an unimproved and dreary spot, there being nothing at all cheerful to behold in a whole circle of twenty yards from the threshold. The grass-plot, as we have described it, was overgrown with such vegetation as is most tenacious of life, and such as can best thrive on an unimproved soil, and a spot that has been made rank by the decay of all sorts of rubbish. It was evidently finding something congenial in the soil that had so early borne the black flower of civilized society, a prison. But on one side of the portal, and rooted almost at the threshold, was a wild rose-bush, covered, in this month of June, with its delicate gems, which might be imagined to offer their fragrance and fragile beauty to the prisoner as he went in, or to the condemned criminal as he came forth to his doom, in token that the deep heart of Nature could pity and be kind to him.",

MAJOR STRUCTURAL ISSUES:\n- The completion introduces an extended reflection on the rose-bush, including speculation about its historical survival and a reference to a specific historical figure, which is not present in the original passage. This is an invented section that shifts the focus and adds content not found in the source material.\n- The completion also adds a metaphorical interpretation of the rose-bush and its symbolic meaning, as well as a direct address to the reader, which are not part of the original excerpt.\n\n2. MISSING ELEMENTS:\n- The completion omits the specific description of the grass-plot's location between the prison and the wheel-track of the street, which is a key spatial detail in the original.\n- It does not include the detail about the overgrown vegetation \"evidently finding something congenial in the soil that had so early borne the black flower of civilized society, a prison,\" which is a significant thematic observation in the original.\n\n3. INACCURATE ELEMENTS:\n- There is an inaccurate description of the burial ground's significance, with the completion referring to it as \"the nucleus of a town, and the heart of the old church-yard,\" which does not match the original's focus on the sepulchres and the specific location.\n- The sequence of events is altered: the completion introduces the rose-bush's symbolic meaning and historical speculation after describing the vegetation, whereas the original ends with the rose-bush's presence and its possible offering to prisoners, without further elaboration.\n- The completion inaccurately expands on the types of vegetation and adds details such as \"a wild growth of brambles, and a few straggling stalks of Indian corn,\" which are not present in the original passage."

Amongst any other population, or at a later period in the history of New England, the grim rigidity that petrified the bearded physiognomies of these good people would have augured some awful business in hand. It could have betokened nothing short of the anticipated execution of some noted culprit, on whom the sentence of a legal tribunal had but confirmed the verdict of public sentiment. But, in that early severity of the Puritan character, an inference of this kind could not so indubitably be drawn. It might be that a sluggish bond-servant, or an undutiful child, whom his parents had given over to the civil authority, was to be corrected at the whipping-post. It might be, that an Antinomian, a Quaker, or other heterodox religionist was to be scourged out of the town, or an idle and vagrant Indian, whom the white man’s fire-water had made riotous about the streets, was to be driven with stripes into the shadow of the forest. It might be, too, that a witch, like old Mistress Hibbins, the bitter-tempered widow of the magistrate, was to die upon the gallows. In either case, there was very much the same solemnity of demeanor on the part of the spectators; as befitted a people amongst whom religion and law were almost identical, and in whose character both were so thoroughly interfused, that the mildest and the severest acts of public discipline were alike made venerable and awful. Meagre, indeed, and cold was the sympathy that a transgressor might look for, from such bystanders, at the scaffold. On the other hand, a penalty, which, in our days, would infer a degree of mocking infamy and ridicule, might then be invested with almost as stern a dignity as the punishment of death itself.",

Beneath the eaves, and clustered around the door-step, were congregated the great looks and bearded visages of moralists, divines, and legislators; a spectacle so rigid and severe, that it could not fail to interest, as a matter of human sympathy, even the freeliest-arranged spirit, and to deal with it as if it involved the destinies of eternity.  With many individuals, no doubt, there were personal motives awakened, either of vindictive hatred, jealous scorn, or the half-chilled malignity of ill-will which seeks not to wreak itself in mischief, but to behold it done by others.  But, we will not speak of that; it was this great moral ruler, the Puritanic code of law, which might be traced in every feature of the spectacle.

The objects of observation were not few.  The stocks were frequently in use, and there were few days without some offender, either in a pillory or a whipping-post.  The latter was a fixture of the market-place, and the former was a movable engine of punishment, which was brought out of the jail whenever it was needed.  It was seldom, however, that an offender was put in the stocks for a longer time than a few hours.  The whipping-post was more frequently in use, and the offender was usually tied to it for a longer time.  The pillory was used for a variety of offences, such as drunkenness, idleness, and the like.

Morally, as well as materially, there was a coarser fibre in those wives and maidens of old English birth and breeding, than in their fair descendants, separated from them by a series of six or seven generations; for, throughout that chain of ancestry, every successive mother has transmitted to her child a fainter bloom, a more delicate and briefer beauty, and a slighter physical frame, if not a character of less force and solidity, than her own. The women who were now standing about the prison-door stood within less than half a century of the period when the man-like Elizabeth had been the not altogether unsuitable representative of the sex. They were her countrywomen; and the beef and ale of their native land, with a moral diet not a whit more refined, entered largely into their composition. The bright morning sun, therefore, shone on broad shoulders and well-developed busts, and on round and ruddy cheeks, that had ripened in the far-off island, and had hardly yet grown paler or thinner in the atmosphere of New England.

The women were mostly stout Englishwomen, with broad shoulders and brawny arms, and bare effrontery of speech, that was common enough in that day, but would be deemed exceedingly coarse and unfeminine in these times. They were accustomed to stand firm on the outskirts of civilised things, and be the first to encounter the wilderness, bodily, as well as spiritually, in its wildest shapes.

Is there not law for it? Truly, there is, both in the Scripture and the statute-book. Then let the magistrates, who have made it of no effect, thank themselves if their own wives and daughters go astray!”\n“Mercy on us, goodwife,” exclaimed a man in the crowd, “is there no virtue in woman, save what springs from a wholesome fear of the gallows?

This personage prefigured and represented in his aspect the whole dismal severity of the Puritanic code of law, which it was his business to administer in its final and closest application to the offender. Stretching forth the official staff in his left hand, he laid his right upon the shoulder of a young woman, whom he thus drew forward; until, on the threshold of the prison-door, she repelled him, by an action marked with natural dignity and force of character, and stepped into the open air, as if by her own free will. She bore in her arms a child, a baby of some three months old, who winked and turned aside its little face from the too vivid light of day; because its existence, heretofore, had brought it acquainted only with the gray twilight of a dungeon, or other darksome apartment of the prison.\nWhen the young woman—the mother of this child—stood fully revealed before the crowd, it seemed to be her first impulse to clasp the infant closely to her bosom; not so much by an impulse of motherly affection, as that she might thereby conceal a certain token, which was wrought or fastened into her dress. In a moment, however, wisely judging that one token of her shame would but poorly serve to hide another, she took the baby on her arm, and, with a burning blush, and yet a haughty smile, and a glance that would not be abashed, looked around at her towns-people and neighbors. On the breast of her gown, in fine red cloth, surrounded with an elaborate embroidery and fantastic flourishes of gold-thread, appeared the letter A. It was so artistically done, and with so much fertility and gorgeous luxuriance of fancy, that it had all the effect of a last and fitting decoration to the apparel which she wore; and which was of a splendor in accordance with the taste of the age, but greatly beyond what was allowed by the sumptuary regulations of the colony.\nThe young woman was tall, with a figure of perfect elegance on a large scale. She had dark and abundant hair, so glossy that it threw off the sunshine with a gleam, and a face which, besides being beautiful from regularity of feature and richness of complexion, had the impressiveness belonging to a marked brow and deep black eyes. She was lady-like, too, after the manner of the feminine gentility of those days; characterized by a certain state and dignity, rather than by the delicate, evanescent, and indescribable grace, which is now recognized as its indication. And never had Hester Prynne appeared more lady-like, in the antique interpretation of the term, than as she issued from the prison. Those who had before known her, and had expected to behold her dimmed and obscured by a disastrous cloud, were astonished, and even startled, to perceive how her beauty shone out, and made a halo of the misfortune and ignominy in which she was enveloped. It may be true, that, to a sensitive observer, there was something exquisitely painful in it. Her attire, which, indeed, she had wrought for the occasion, in prison, and had modelled much after her own fancy, seemed to express the attitude of her spirit, the desperate recklessness of her mood, by its wild and picturesque peculiarity. But the point which drew all eyes, and, as it were, transfigured the wearer,—so that both men and women, who had been familiarly acquainted with Hester Prynne, were now impressed as if they beheld her for the first time,—was that Scarlet Letter, so fantastically embroidered and illuminated upon her bosom. It had the effect of a spell, taking her out of the ordinary relations with humanity, and enclosing her in a sphere by herself.",

This personage immediately put forth his head, looking about him, with a keen and penetrative glance, and spoke, in a loud, harsh voice, “Make way, good people, make way, in the King’s name, for the constable and the prisoner!”\r\n\r\nAnd now, forth from the dark and gloomy portal, issued the object of all this interest, who for so many months had been kept hidden in the obscurity of the prison, and had been the subject of so much speculation in the community. She was a woman of a figure large and marked, and seemed to have been endowed with a rich and luxuriant beauty; though the flush of shame, or the agony of the moment, had diffused a burning glow over her face, and had given to her majestic figure a certain rigidity, that betokened the struggle of her spirit with the ignominy that she was enduring. With a morbid energy, she had betwixt her hands a baby of some three months old, who shrieked and struggled in the grasp of its mother, as if affrighted by the sudden glare of the daylight, and the throng of faces that surrounded it. On the breast of her gown, in fine red cloth, surrounded with an elaborate embroidery and fantastic flourishes of gold thread, appeared the letter A. It was so artistically done, and with so much richness and beauty of design, that it had the effect of a spell, taking hold of the beholder’s eye, and keeping it riveted on the wearer. If ever there was a black and ugly spot on any human soul, it was the sin for which she was suffering. But on Hester Prynne’s bosom, it was so fantastically embroidered and illuminated, that it had the effect of a mask, or a veil, to hide the spiritual deformity of her heart. It was impossible to determine, whether the wearer felt pride or shame, or a mixture of both. She bore her burden with a certain stately grace, that was not without its effect on the multitude. The young women of the town, some of whom had been her companions in the days of her unblemished fame, were especially bitter against her. They stood together, and whispered, with a stern and rigid aspect, and a bitter smile on their faces. “At the very least,” said one, “they should have put her to death. She hath brought shame upon us all.” “Nay,” answered another, “but the letter A is a lighter punishment than she deserves. She should have been branded on the forehead, so that all might see her sin.” “And the child,” said a third, “it is the living image of her sin. It should have been taken from her, and brought up in a godly household.”\r\n\r\nBut the older women, who had known Hester in her youth, and had seen her grow up to womanhood, were more merciful. They shook their heads, and sighed, and said, “Alas, poor soul! She hath sinned, but she hath suffered much already. May God have mercy on her.”\r\n\r\nThe crowd was a strange mixture of pity and condemnation. Some looked on with a morbid curiosity, others with a stern and righteous indignation. But all eyes were fixed on Hester Prynne, and the scarlet letter on her breast. She was the living sermon, the visible symbol of sin and shame. As she stood there, in the full glare of the sun, with the baby in her arms, and the scarlet letter on her bosom, she seemed to be the very embodiment of the sin that she had committed. The crowd pressed closer, eager to catch a glimpse of the woman who had dared to violate the sacred laws of their community. The beadle, with his staff of office, cleared a path through the throng, and led the way towards the market-place, where the scaffold had been erected. Hester followed, with a firm step, and a proud bearing, as if she were walking to a throne, rather than to a place of shame. The baby in her arms continued to shriek and struggle, but she held it fast, as if it were the only thing that she had left in the world. The scarlet letter on her breast seemed to burn with a fierce and fiery glow, as if it were a living thing, and not merely a piece of cloth."

Preceded by the beadle, and attended by an irregular procession of stern-browed men and unkindly visaged women, Hester Prynne set forth towards the place appointed for her punishment. A crowd of eager and curious school-boys, understanding little of the matter in hand, except that it gave them a half-holiday, ran before her progress, turning their heads continually to stare into her face, and at the winking baby in her arms, and at the ignominious letter on her breast. It was no great distance, in those days, from the prison-door to the market-place. Measured by the prisoner’s experience, however, it might be reckoned a journey of some length; for, haughty as her demeanor was, she perchance underwent an agony from every footstep of those that thronged to see her, as if her heart had been flung into the street for them all to spurn and trample upon. In our nature, however, there is a provision, alike marvellous and merciful, that the sufferer should never know the intensity of what he endures by its present torture, but chiefly by the pang that rankles after it. With almost a serene deportment, therefore, Hester Prynne passed through this portion of her ordeal, and came to a sort of scaffold, at the western extremity of the market-place. It stood nearly beneath the eaves of Boston’s earliest church, and appeared to be a fixture there.\nIn fact, this scaffold constituted a portion of a penal machine, which now, for two or three generations past, has been merely historical and traditionary among us, but was held, in the old time, to be as effectual an agent, in the promotion of good citizenship, as ever was the guillotine among the terrorists of France. It was, in short, the platform of the pillory; and above it rose the framework of that instrument of discipline, so fashioned as to confine the human head in its tight grasp, and thus hold it up to the public gaze. The very ideal of ignominy was embodied and made manifest in this contrivance of wood and iron. There can be no outrage, methinks, against our common nature,—whatever be the delinquencies of the individual,—no outrage more flagrant than to forbid the culprit to hide his face for shame; as it was the essence of this punishment to do. In Hester Prynne’s instance, however, as not unfrequently in other cases, her sentence bore, that she should stand a certain time upon the platform, but without undergoing that gripe about the neck and confinement of the head, the proneness to which was the most devilish characteristic of this ugly engine. Knowing well her part, she ascended a flight of wooden steps, and was thus displayed to the surrounding multitude, at about the height of a man’s shoulders above the street.",

The entire distance, in the street, from the prison-door to the market-place, was little more than a hundred yards. But, nevertheless, it seemed a great while to be passing. It could not be otherwise; for, during those few moments, Hester Prynne underwent a whole life of ignominy; a whole life of public scorn, with the agony of infamy burning from every corner of the market-place, and concentrating itself upon her as the centre of the multitudinous gaze. Luckily for the poor woman, the agony of infamy is never more pungent than when she first stands before the tribunal of the world. It might be that, hereafter, there would be a more intimate blight and mildew, which should shrivel up her heart, but never any further pang of more exquisite torture than was felt during those few moments of her walk. Hester Prynne had arrived, and was now standing on the scaffold, at the western extremity of the market-place, and near the place where the oldest church still stands.

Here, there was the taint of deepest sin in the most sacred quality of human life, working such effect, that the world was only the darker for this woman’s beauty, and the more lost for the infant that she had borne.\nThe scene was not without a mixture of awe, such as must always invest the spectacle of guilt and shame in a fellow-creature, before society shall have grown corrupt enough to smile, instead of shuddering, at it. The witnesses of Hester Prynne’s disgrace had not yet passed beyond their simplicity. They were stern enough to look upon her death, had that been the sentence, without a murmur at its severity, but had none of the heartlessness of another social state, which would find only a theme for jest in an exhibition like the present. Even had there been a disposition to turn the matter into ridicule, it must have been repressed and overpowered by the solemn presence of men no less dignified than the Governor, and several of his counsellors, a judge, a general, and the ministers of the town; all of whom sat or stood in a balcony of the meeting-house, looking down upon the platform. When such personages could constitute a part of the spectacle, without risking the majesty or reverence of rank and office, it was safely to be inferred that the infliction of a legal sentence would have an earnest and effectual meaning. Accordingly, the crowd was sombre and grave. The unhappy culprit sustained herself as best a woman might, under the heavy weight of a thousand unrelenting eyes, all fastened upon her, and concentrated at her bosom. It was almost intolerable to be borne. Of an impulsive and passionate nature, she had fortified herself to encounter the stings and venomous stabs of public contumely, wreaking itself in every variety of insult; but there was a quality so much more terrible in the solemn mood of the popular mind, that she longed rather to behold all those rigid countenances contorted with scornful merriment, and herself the object. Had a roar of laughter burst from the multitude,—each man, each woman, each little shrill-voiced child, contributing their individual parts,—Hester Prynne might have repaid them all with a bitter and disdainful smile. But, under the leaden infliction which it was her doom to endure, she felt, at moments, as if she must needs shriek out with the full power of her lungs, and cast herself from the scaffold down upon the ground, or else go mad at once.",

Here, there was the taint of deepest sin in the most sacred quality of human life, working such effect, that the world was only the darker for this woman's beauty, and the more lost for the infant that she had borne. The grim rigidity of the Puritanic code was softened by the feminine grace of the loveliest woman in the land, so far as that quality might soften it. She might have come forth from the hands of a sculptor, who had skilfully moulded the dead lump of clay into a shape of life and beauty, so perfect was her form; so erect and stately she stood, though her face was pale and her brow contracted with a frown. The young woman was tall, with a figure of perfect elegance on a large scale. She had dark and abundant hair, so glossy that it threw off the sunshine with a gleam, and a face which, besides being beautiful from regularity of feature and richness of complexion, had the impressiveness belonging to a marked brow and deep black eyes. She was ladylike, too, after the manner of the feminine gentility of those days; characterized by a certain stately grace, rather than by the delicate, evanescent, and indescribable grace, which is now recognized as its essence. And betwixt her and the nearest spectator intervened the infant, on whose behalf solely she was exposed to this dark and miserable hour. It was baby-like in its second month, with a face bright and calm. A crimson flush was glowing on her cheek, that had been long absent; the scarlet letter, so fantastically embroidered and illumined upon her bosom. It had the effect of a spell, taking her out of the ordinary relations with ordinary things, and inclosing her in a sphere by herself. \"She hath good skill at her needle, that's certain,\" muttered one of the female spectators; \"but did ever a woman, since the creation of the world, embroider the like of that scarlet letter?\" \"Come, good sirs,\" said the constable, who stood beside the scaffold, \"let us be thankful for at least so much grace and tenderness as there is in a woman's heart, that she wrought not on the rich robe of the Governor and councillors, for it was their order that she should wear the letter.\" \"Truly,\" said another, \"it were well for the Reverend Mr. Dimmesdale, if we women, like our sisters in the old country, were allowed to dole out our own measure from the deacon's board, in stead of having it poured out by the cupful, not knowing whether it be wine or vinegar that we drink.\" \"Why, good dame,\" said the constable, \"that is a matter of conscience, and we may not meddle with it. But, as for the scarlet letter, I promise you, it is a matter of law, and we may not meddle with that either.\" The crowd was sombre and grave. The effect of the spectacle was to make every beholder feel his own heartquake, as if he were himself guilty of the sin that was thus publicly exposed, and as if he were himself about to be subjected to the same shame and ignominy. This was the effect of the spectacle, and it was a good effect, so far as it went.

            "A torrent of memories, from trivial childhood incidents and school days to youthful quarrels and domestic moments of her girlhood, resurfaced, intermingling with recollections of more serious events from her later life; each memory appeared with equal clarity, as if all held similar significance or were merely scenes in a play.",
            "The narrator suggests this mental activity might have been an instinctive coping mechanism, a way for her spirit to escape the cruel weight of her present circumstances by conjuring these phantasms.",
            "From her elevated position on the pillory, Hester's entire life seemed to pass before her eyes.",
            "She envisioned her native English village and her ancestral home, a dilapidated stone house showing signs of poverty yet retaining a partially obscured coat of arms above the doorway, a vestige of former gentility.",
            "She saw her father's face, marked by a bald forehead and a venerable white beard, and her mother's face, etched with a look of attentive and anxious love, a memory that had often served as a gentle check on her daughter's actions even after her death.",
            "She recalled her own youthful, radiant beauty as seen in a mirror.",
            "Another visage then appeared in her mind's eye: that of an older man, pale, thin, and scholarly, his eyes dimmed from long hours spent reading by lamplight, yet possessing a remarkable, penetrating quality when he chose to scrutinize a person's soul.",
            "Hester's memory also recalled that this scholarly figure was slightly misshapen, with his left shoulder somewhat higher than his right.",
            "Next, her mental gallery presented images of a Continental city: its complex, narrow streets, tall, gray buildings, immense cathedrals, and ancient public structures; a place where a new chapter of her life had begun, still in association with the deformed scholar, a life that drew sustenance from aged materials, like moss on a decaying wall.",
            "Finally, these fleeting scenes dissolved, and the harsh reality of the Puritan settlement's market-place returned: the assembled townspeople, their stern gazes fixed upon her—Hester Prynne—standing on the scaffold, her infant in her arms, and the scarlet letter 'A', intricately embroidered with gold thread, upon her breast.",
            "Overwhelmed, she clutched the child to her chest so fiercely that it cried out; she then looked down at the scarlet letter, even touching it with her finger, as if to confirm the tangible reality of the infant and her shame.",

Her mind, and especially her memory, was preternaturally active, and kept bringing up other scenes than this roughly hewn street of a little town, on the edge of the Western wilderness; other faces than were lowering upon her from beneath the brims of those steeple-crowned hats. Reminiscences the most trifling and immaterial, passages of infancy and school-days, sports, childish quarrels, and the little domestic traits of her maiden years, came swarming back upon her, intermingled with recollections of whatever was gravest in her subsequent life; one picture precisely as vivid as another; as if all were of similar importance, or all alike a play. Possibly, it was an instinctive device of her spirit, to relieve itself, by the exhibition of these phantasmagoric forms, from the cruel weight and hardness of the reality.\nBe that as it might, the scaffold of the pillory was a point of view that revealed to Hester Prynne the entire track along which she had been treading, since her happy infancy. Standing on that miserable eminence, she saw again her native village, in Old England, and her paternal home; a decayed house of gray stone, with a poverty-stricken aspect, but retaining a half-obliterated shield of arms over the portal, in token of antique gentility. She saw her father’s face, with its bald brow, and reverend white beard, that flowed over the old-fashioned Elizabethan ruff; her mother’s, too, with the look of heedful and anxious love which it always wore in her remembrance, and which, face, glowing with girlish beauty, and illuminating all the interior even since her death, had so often laid the impediment of a gentle remonstrance in her daughter’s pathway. She saw her own of the dusky mirror in which she had been wont to gaze at it. There she beheld another countenance, of a man well stricken in years, a pale, thin, scholar-like visage, with eyes dim and bleared by the lamplight that had served them to pore over many ponderous books. Yet those same bleared optics had a strange, penetrating power, when it was their owner’s purpose to read the human soul. This figure of the study and the cloister, as Hester Prynne’s womanly fancy failed not to recall, was slightly deformed, with the left shoulder a trifle higher than the right. Next rose before her, in memory’s picture-gallery, the intricate and narrow thoroughfares, the tall, gray houses, the huge cathedrals, and the public edifices, ancient in date and quaint in architecture, of a Continental city; where a new life had awaited her, still in connection with the misshapen scholar; a new life, but feeding itself on time-worn materials, like a tuft of green moss on a crumbling wall. Lastly, in lieu of these shifting scenes, came back the rude market-place of the Puritan settlement, with all the towns-people assembled and levelling their stern regards at Hester Prynne,—yes, at herself,—who stood on the scaffold of the pillory, an infant on her arm, and the letter A, in scarlet, fantastically embroidered with gold-thread, upon her bosom!\nCould it be true? She clutched the child so fiercely to her breast, that it sent forth a cry; she turned her eyes downward at the scarlet letter, and even touched it with her finger, to assure herself that the infant and the shame were real. Yes!—these were her realities,—all else had vanished!",

Her mind, and heart, and conscience, had apparently departed, and taken up their abode in some far-off region. The objects that had drawn her hither, the scaffold, the pillory, the iron-clamped door, which still showed the traces of Rosc and Thistle, the familiar features of the magistrates, the clergymen, the town-beadle, the mien and dress of the multitude, all were gone, and vanished like a dream. The grim rigidity of the Puritanic physiognomies was displaced by the sweet light of a smile, which seemed to glisten on her mother's face. It was no longer the murmur of the throng, with its stern and sour discontent, that filled the air, but the low lullaby of her infant. Memories came thronging upon her, of a time when she dwelt in a pleasant English village, and had been a happy child, with bright, golden hair. She remembered her father's face, with its bald brow, and white beard, that flowed down over his breast; and the mother's smile, and the mother's voice, that used to soothe her in her troubles. She remembered, too, a man, elderly, pale, and thin, with a white beard, and a look of care, who had been her husband. She remembered his scholarly habits, and his love of books, and his gentle, though somewhat reserved, manners. She remembered, also, his deformity, which had been a source of pain to her, and a cause of shame. She remembered, too, the time when she had first seen him, in the library of his house, surrounded by his books, and looking like a man who had spent his life in study. She remembered, also, the time when she had left him, and had come to this new world, with her infant in her arms. All these memories came crowding upon her, and she felt as if she were living over again her whole life. But, in the midst of all this, she heard a voice, which seemed to come from the scaffold, and which called her name. She started, and looked up, and saw the face of the man whom she had left in England. It was her husband, Roger Chillingworth. He was standing at the foot of the scaffold, and was looking up at her with a look of intense interest. His face was pale, and his eyes were fixed upon her. She saw, too, that he was deformed, and that his left shoulder was higher than his right. She knew him at once, and her heart sank within her. She had thought that he was dead, and that she was free. But now she saw that he was alive, and that he had followed her to this new world. She knew that he would seek revenge, and that he would find her out. She felt as if she were in a dream, and that she would soon awake. But she did not awake, and the dream went on. She saw the faces of the people, and she heard their voices. She saw the magistrates, and the clergymen, and the town-beadle. She saw the scarlet letter on her breast, and she felt the weight of her infant in her arms. She knew that she was Hester Prynne, and that she was standing on the scaffold, in the market-place of Boston. She knew that she was a sinner, and that she was an outcast. She knew that she was alone, and that she had no one to help her. She felt as if she were in a deep pit, and that she could not get out. She looked down at her infant, and she saw that it was smiling. She pressed it to her breast, and she felt its warmth. She looked up at the sky, and she saw that it was blue. She looked around her, and she saw that the sun was shining. She felt as if she were in a new world, and that she had been born again. She knew that she was Hester Prynne, and that she was a sinner.

The actual reality of her position, the scaffold, the crowd, the minister, the magistrates, who stood before her on the balcony, all vanished out of her sight, and were swallowed up in the immensity of this dim dream. It was a phantasmagoria, in which figures of ancient days, and kindred ones, and dear ones, and those who had been her intimate companions, and those whom she had subsequently met, all flocked before her. She saw her father’s face, with its grave, stern look, bending downwards upon the child that she had once been. She saw her mother’s features, expressing an anxious tenderness for the little Hester, who lingered about the domestic hearth, in her infancy. She saw herself, a child, playing on the sea-shore, or gathering shells along the brink of the ocean. She saw the figure of a man, elderly, with a furrowed brow, and deep-set eyes, and a white beard, who had been her husband, and who had sent her forth alone to the New World. She saw his face, contorted with a spasm of pain, as he bade her farewell, and she felt again the chill of that parting moment. She saw the little cottage in the English village, where she had spent her girlhood, and the church where she had worshipped, and the faces of the people whom she had known. All these spectral images, these ghosts of memory, floated before her, distinct yet unreal, like figures in a dream. They were the past, come back to mock her in her present shame. They were the life she had lived, the life she had lost, the life that was now forever separated from her by the gulf of her sin. And then, as the spectral images faded, and the dim dream dissolved, the actual reality of her position returned upon her with a terrible distinctness. The scaffold, the crowd, the scarlet letter, the shame, the ignominy, all pressed upon her with a weight that seemed to crush her very soul. She felt the gaze of a thousand eyes, all fixed upon her, all condemning her. She heard the murmurs of the crowd, the whispers of scorn, the words of judgment. She saw the stern faces of the magistrates, the sorrowful face of the minister, the curious faces of the people. She felt the burning heat of the scarlet letter upon her breast, a brand of shame that could never be removed. It was no longer a dream, but a terrible reality, a reality of pain and suffering, of shame and ignominy, that would follow her to her grave. She was Hester Prynne, the woman who had sinned, the woman who wore the scarlet letter, the woman who stood upon the scaffold, a spectacle of shame to the whole community. And she knew that this was her penance, her punishment, her life from this day forward. The spectral images of the past were gone, and only the harsh reality of the present remained, a reality that was as real and as terrible as the scarlet letter itself."

An Indian, in his native garb, was standing there; but the red men were not so infrequent visitors of the English settlements, that one of them would have attracted any notice from Hester Prynne, at such a time; much less would he have excluded all other objects and ideas from her mind. By the Indian’s side, and evidently sustaining a companionship with him, stood a white man, clad in a strange disarray of civilized and savage costume.\nHe was small in stature, with a furrowed visage, which, as yet, could hardly be termed aged. There was a remarkable intelligence in his features, as of a person who had so cultivated his mental part that it could not fail to mould the physical to itself, and become manifest by unmistakable tokens. Although, by a seemingly careless arrangement of his heterogeneous garb, he had endeavored to conceal or abate the peculiarity, it was sufficiently evident to Hester Prynne, that one of this man’s shoulders rose higher than the other. Again, at the first instant of perceiving that thin visage, and the slight deformity of the figure, she pressed her infant to her bosom with so convulsive a force that the poor babe uttered another cry of pain. But the mother did not seem to hear it.\nAt his arrival in the market-place, and some time before she saw him, the stranger had bent his eyes on Hester Prynne. It was carelessly, at first, like a man chiefly accustomed to look inward, and to whom external matters are of little value and import, unless they bear relation to something within his mind. Very soon, however, his look became keen and penetrative. A writhing horror twisted itself across his features, like a snake gliding swiftly over them, and making one little pause, with all its wreathed intervolutions in open sight. His face darkened with some powerful emotion, which, nevertheless, he so instantaneously controlled by an effort of his will, that, save at a single moment, its expression might have passed for calmness. After a brief space, the convulsion grew almost imperceptible, and finally subsided into the depths of his nature. When he found the eyes of Hester Prynne fastened on his own, and saw that she appeared to recognize him, he slowly and calmly raised his finger, made a gesture with it in the air, and laid it on his lips.",

She hath raised a great scandal, I promise you, in godly Master Dimmesdale’s church.”\n“You say truly,” replied the other. “I am a stranger, and have been a wanderer, sorely against my will. I have met with grievous mishaps by sea and land, and have been long held in bonds among the heathen-folk, to the southward; and am now brought hither by this Indian, to be redeemed out of my captivity. Will it please you, therefore, to tell me of Hester Prynne’s,—have I her name rightly?—of this woman’s offences, and what has brought her to yonder scaffold?”\n“Truly, friend; and methinks it must gladden your heart, after your troubles and sojourn in the wilderness,” said the townsman, “to find yourself, at length, in a land where iniquity is searched out, and punished in the sight of rulers and people; as here in our godly New England. Yonder woman, Sir, you must know, was the wife of a certain learned man, English by birth, but who had long dwelt in Amsterdam, whence, some good time agone, he was minded to cross over and cast in his lot with us of the Massachusetts. To this purpose, he sent his wife before him, remaining himself to look after some necessary affairs. Marry, good Sir, in some two years, or less, that the woman has been a dweller here in Boston, no tidings have come of this learned gentleman, Master Prynne; and his young wife, look you, being left to her own misguidance—”\n“Ah!—aha!—I conceive you,” said the stranger, with a bitter smile. “So learned a man as you speak of should have learned this too in his books. And who, by your favor, Sir, may be the father of yonder babe—it is some three or four months old, I should judge—which Mistress Prynne is holding in her arms?”\n“Of a truth, friend, that matter remaineth a riddle; and the Daniel who shall expound it is yet a-wanting,” answered the townsman. “Madam Hester absolutely refuseth to speak, and the magistrates have laid their heads together in vain. Peradventure the guilty one stands looking on at this sad spectacle, unknown of man, and forgetting that God sees him.”\n“The learned man,” observed the stranger, with another smile, “should come himself, to look into the mystery.”\n“It behooves him well, if he be still in life,” responded the townsman. “Now, good Sir, our Massachusetts magistracy, bethinking themselves that this woman is youthful and fair, and doubtless was strongly tempted to her fall,—and that, moreover, as is most likely, her husband may be at the bottom of the sea,—they have not been bold to put in force the extremity of our righteous law against her. The penalty thereof is death. But in their great mercy and tenderness of heart, they have doomed Mistress Prynne to stand only a space of three hours on the platform of the pillory, and then and thereafter, for the remainder of her natural life, to wear a mark of shame upon her bosom.”\n“A wise sentence!” remarked the stranger, gravely bowing his head. “Thus she will be a living sermon against sin, until the ignominious letter be engraved upon her tombstone. It irks me, nevertheless, that the partner of her iniquity should not, at least, stand on the scaffold by her side. But he will be known!—he will be known!—he will be known!”\nHe bowed courteously to the communicative townsman, and, whispering a few words to his Indian attendant, they both made their way through the crowd.",

Such an interview, perhaps, would have been more terrible than even to meet him as she now did, with the hot, mid-day sun burning down upon her face, and lighting up its shame; with the scarlet token of infamy on her breast; with the sin-born infant in her arms; with a whole people, drawn forth as to a festival, staring at the features that should have been seen only in the quiet gleam of the fireside, in the happy shadow of a home, or beneath a matronly veil, at church. Dreadful as it was, she was conscious of a shelter in the presence of these thousand witnesses. It was better to stand thus, with so many betwixt him and her, than to greet him, face to face, they two alone. She fled for refuge, as it were, to the public exposure, and dreaded the moment when its protection should be withdrawn from her. Involved in these thoughts, she scarcely heard a voice behind her, until it had repeated her name more than once, in a loud and solemn tone, audible to the whole multitude.\n“Hearken unto me, Hester Prynne!” said the voice.\nIt has already been noticed, that directly over the platform on which Hester Prynne stood was a kind of balcony, or open gallery, appended to the meeting-house. It was the place whence proclamations were wont to be made, amidst an assemblage of the magistracy, with all the ceremonial that attended such public observances in those days. Here, to witness the scene which we are describing, sat Governor Bellingham himself, with four sergeants about his chair, bearing halberds, as a guard of honor. He wore a dark feather in his hat, a border of embroidery on his cloak, and a black velvet tunic beneath; a gentleman advanced in years, with a hard experience written in his wrinkles. He was not ill fitted to be the head and representative of a community, which owed its origin and progress, and its present state of development, not to the impulses of youth, but to the stern and tempered energies of manhood, and the sombre sagacity of age; accomplishing so much, precisely because it imagined and hoped so little. The other eminent characters, by whom the chief ruler was surrounded, were distinguished by a dignity of mien, belonging to a period when the forms of authority were felt to possess the sacredness of Divine institutions. They were, doubtless, good men, just and sage. But, out of the whole human family, it would not have been easy to select the same number of wise and virtuous persons, who should be less capable of sitting in judgment on an erring woman’s heart, and disentangling its mesh of good and evil, than the sages of rigid aspect towards whom Hester Prynne now turned her face. She seemed conscious, indeed, that whatever sympathy she might expect lay in the larger and warmer heart of the multitude; for, as she lifted her eyes towards the balcony, the unhappy woman grew pale and trembled.",

This last attribute, however, had been less carefully developed than his intellectual gifts, and was, in truth, rather a matter of shame than self-congratulation with him. There he stood, with a border of grizzled locks beneath his skull-cap; while his gray eyes, accustomed to the shaded light of his study, were winking, like those of Hester’s infant, in the unadulterated sunshine. He looked like the darkly engraved portraits which we see prefixed to old volumes of sermons; and had no more right than one of those portraits would have, to step forth, as he now did, and meddle with a question of human guilt, passion, and anguish.\n“Hester Prynne,” said the clergyman, “I have striven with my young brother here, under whose preaching of the word you have been privileged to sit,”—here Mr. Wilson laid his hand on the shoulder of a pale young man beside him,—“I have sought, I say, to persuade this godly youth, that he should deal with you, here in the face of Heaven, and before these wise and upright rulers, and in hearing of all the people, as touching the vileness and blackness of your sin. Knowing your natural temper better than I, he could the better judge what arguments to use, whether of tenderness or terror, such as might prevail over your hardness and obstinacy; insomuch that you should no longer hide the name of him who tempted you to this grievous fall. But he opposes to me (with a young man’s over-softness, albeit wise beyond his years), that it were wronging the very nature of woman to force her to lay open her heart’s secrets in such broad daylight, and in presence of so great a multitude. Truly, as I sought to convince him, the shame lay in the commission of the sin, and not in the showing of it forth. What say you to it, once again, Brother Dimmesdale? Must it be thou, or I, that shall deal with this poor sinner’s soul?”\nThere was a murmur among the dignified and reverend occupants of the balcony; and Governor Bellingham gave expression to its purport, speaking in an authoritative voice, although tempered with respect towards the youthful clergyman whom he addressed.\n“Good Master Dimmesdale,” said he, “the responsibility of this woman’s soul lies greatly with you. It behooves you, therefore, to exhort her to repentance, and to confession, as a proof and consequence thereof.”",

            "He was described as having a striking appearance, with a high forehead, large, sorrowful brown eyes, and a mouth prone to trembling, indicative of both acute nervous sensitivity and significant self-control; yet he often appeared uneasy and lost in the world, finding comfort only in solitude.",

            "He suggested that open ignominy, like hers, was a divine gift that could lead to triumph over sin and sorrow, and she should not deny this difficult but healing opportunity to her partner.",
            "Dimmesdale's voice, characterized by its tremulous sweetness, richness, depth, and broken quality, conveyed profound emotion that deeply affected all who heard it, creating a unified wave of sympathy among the listeners; even Hester's infant seemed to respond, gazing at Dimmesdale and raising its arms with a mixed expression of pleasure and plaintiveness.",
            "The impact of his appeal was so strong that the assembled crowd fully expected either Hester to confess the name or for the guilty man himself, wherever he might be, to be irresistibly compelled to come forward and join her on the scaffold."

His eloquence and religious fervor had already given the earnest of high eminence in his profession. He was a person of very striking aspect, with a white, lofty, and impending brow, large brown, melancholy eyes, and a mouth which, unless when he forcibly compressed it, was apt to be tremulous, expressing both nervous sensibility and a vast power of self-restraint. Notwithstanding his high native gifts and scholar-like attainments, there was an air about this young minister,—an apprehensive, a startled, a half-frightened look,—as of a being who felt himself quite astray and at a loss in the pathway of human existence, and could only be at ease in some seclusion of his own. Therefore, so far as his duties would permit, he trod in the shadowy by-paths, and thus kept himself simple and childlike; coming forth, when occasion was, with a freshness, and fragrance, and dewy purity of thought, which, as many people said, affected them like the speech of an angel.\nSuch was the young man whom the Reverend Mr. Wilson and the Governor had introduced so openly to the public notice, bidding him speak, in the hearing of all men, to that mystery of a woman’s soul, so sacred even in its pollution. The trying nature of his position drove the blood from his cheek, and made his lips tremulous.\n“Speak to the woman, my brother,” said Mr. Wilson. “It is of moment to her soul, and therefore, as the worshipful Governor says, momentous to thine own, in whose charge hers is. Exhort her to confess the truth!”\nThe Reverend Mr. Dimmesdale bent his head, in silent prayer, as it seemed, and then came forward.\n“Hester Prynne,” said he, leaning over the balcony and looking down steadfastly into her eyes, “thou hearest what this good man says, and seest the accountability under which I labor. If thou feelest it to be for thy soul’s peace, and that thy earthly punishment will thereby be made more effectual to salvation, I charge thee to speak out the name of thy fellow-sinner and fellow-sufferer! Be not silent from any mistaken pity and tenderness for him; for, believe me, Hester, though he were to step down from a high place, and stand there beside thee, on thy pedestal of shame, yet better were it so than to hide a guilty heart through life. What can thy silence do for him, except it tempt him—yea, compel him, as it were—to add hypocrisy to sin? Heaven hath granted thee an open ignominy, that thereby thou mayest work out an open triumph over the evil within thee, and the sorrow without. Take heed how thou deniest to him—who, perchance, hath not the courage to grasp it for himself—the bitter, but wholesome, cup that is now presented to thy lips!”\nThe young pastor’s voice was tremulously sweet, rich, deep, and broken. The feeling that it so evidently manifested, rather than the direct purport of the words, caused it to vibrate within all hearts, and brought the listeners into one accord of sympathy. Even the poor baby, at Hester’s bosom, was affected by the same influence; for it directed its hitherto vacant gaze towards Mr. Dimmesdale, and held up its little arms, with a half-pleased, half-plaintive murmur. So powerful seemed the minister’s appeal, that the people could not believe but that Hester Prynne would speak out the guilty name; or else that the guilty one himself, in whatever high or lowly place he stood, would be drawn forth by an inward and inevitable necessity, and compelled to ascend to the scaffold.",

Notwithstanding his high native gifts and scholarlike attainments, there was an air about this young minister,—an apprehensive, a startled, a half-frightened look,—as of a being who felt himself astray and remote from men, pitied in his solitude, but incapable of rising above its melancholy sphere. Now, however, his face reddened with the rich blood that drove suddenly into it, when he found himself thus brought prominently forward, and made the centre of all eyes. Before the general gaze turned elsewhere, Prynne, he stepped forward, and laid his hand upon the breast of the scarlet letter. “Reverend Mr. Dimmesdale,” said the Governor, “there hath been much question concerning the father of this infant. Old Master Prynne, thou hearest what this good man saith. Speak out the name! That, and thy repentance, may avail to take the scarlet letter off thy bosom.” “Never!” replied Hester Prynne, looking, not at Mr. Wilson, but into the deep and troubled eyes of the younger clergyman. “It is too deeply branded. Ye cannot take it off. And would that I might endure his agony, as well as mine!” “Speak, woman!” said the Governor, looking sternly at her. “Of a truth, she hath long been a woman of very marked physiognomy! What is that baby to be called, Hester?” “I have no Heavenly Father!” answered the child, with a burst of passion. “And my earthly one will not acknowledge me!” “Hush, child, hush!” said the Governor, with a frown. “Do not speak so loud. Where is the father of the child, Hester?” “I will not speak!” answered Hester, with a look of defiance. “And my child shall seek a Heavenly Father in vain!” “Woman, woman,” cried the Reverend Mr. Wilson, “what hast thou done? Thou hast made a mock of us all!” “Nay, not so, good Mr. Wilson,” said the Reverend Mr. Dimmesdale, with a smile. “She hath but followed the dictates of her own heart. And who are we, that we should judge her?” “True, true,” said Mr. Wilson. “But the child, the child! What is to be done with the child?” “Let her be brought up in the nurture and admonition of the Lord,” said Mr. Dimmesdale. “And let her be taught to fear God, and to keep his commandments.” “Amen!” said Mr. Wilson. “So let it be.” And the child was brought to the front of the scaffold, and placed in the arms of the Reverend Mr. Dimmesdale. He took the child in his arms, and looked at it with a strange mixture of pity and horror. “Child,” said he, “thy mother hath sinned. But thou art innocent. And I will be a father to thee.” He kissed the child, and then gave it back to its mother. “Woman,” said he, “thou hast heard what I have said. Wilt thou not speak the name of the man who is the father of thy child?” “I will not speak!” answered Hester. “And my child shall seek a Heavenly Father in vain!” “Be not silent from any mistaken pity and tenderness for him; for, believe me, Hester, though he were to step down from a high place, and stand beside thee on thy pedestal of shame, it would not be the worst punishment that could be inflicted, in this world, nor the worst torture hereafter! With this public shame, it is true, thou mayest cover them deep within thy spirit, and conceal them, perchance, even from the Father of all; but it will be no healing consolation. Rather, while thou strugglest with thy dreadful secret, his spirit will keep itself alive in the business of the world, and walk abroad, in the sunshine and among living hearts, unburdened with the avenging scarlet letter, which only thou shalt wear. It may be,” he added, “that thy partner seeks to conceal his sin from the sight of men, and believeth the same to be hidden from the sight of God. Woe unto him if he so deem! There is no substance in it, save what doth live in the secret conscience.” His voice tremulous, yet deep, gave an impressive effect to what he said, that caused the auditors to thrill. The baby, too, looking at Dimmesdale, with its small face full of earnestness, and its little arms outstretched, responded to his words with a cry that seemed full of pain and pleasure. “She will not speak!” murmured Mr. Wilson. “And the father is unknown! This is a strange case, Governor! Is there no way to force her to speak?” “Nay, good Mr. Wilson,” said Governor Bellingham, “it is not meet that we put her to the torture. Let her be dealt with according to the law.” “But the child, the child!” cried Mr. Wilson. “What is to be done with the child?” “Let her be brought up in the nurture and admonition of the Lord,” said Mr. Dimmesdale. “And let her be taught to fear God, and to keep his commandments.” “Amen!” said Mr. Wilson.",

                "text": "The directness of this appeal drew the eyes of the whole crowd upon the Reverend Mr. Dimmesdale; a young clergyman, who had come from one of the great English universities, bringing all the learning of the age into our wild forest-land. His eloquence and religious fervor had already given the earnest of high eminence in his profession. He was a person of very striking aspect, with a white, lofty, and intellectual brow; large, brown, melancholy eyes, and a mouth which, unless he forcibly compressed it, was apt to be tremulous, expressing both nervous sensibility and a vast power of self-restraint. Notwithstanding his high native gifts and scholarlike attainments, there was an air about this young minister,—an apprehensive, a startled, a half-frightened look,—as of a being who felt himself astray and remote from men, pitied in his solitude, but incapable of rising above its melancholy sphere. Now, however, his face reddened with the rich blood that drove suddenly into it, when he found himself thus brought prominently forward, and made the centre of all eyes. Before the general gaze turned elsewhere, Prynne, he stepped forward, and laid his hand upon the breast of the scarlet letter. “Reverend Mr. Dimmesdale,” said the Governor, “there hath been much question concerning the father of this infant. Old Master Prynne, thou hearest what this good man saith. Speak out the name! That, and thy repentance, may avail to take the scarlet letter off thy bosom.” “Never!” replied Hester Prynne, looking, not at Mr. Wilson, but into the deep and troubled eyes of the younger clergyman. “It is too deeply branded. Ye cannot take it off. And would that I might endure his agony, as well as mine!” “Speak, woman!” said the Governor, looking sternly at her. “Of a truth, she hath long been a woman of very marked physiognomy! What is that baby to be called, Hester?” “I have no Heavenly Father!” answered the child, with a burst of passion. “And my earthly one will not acknowledge me!” “Hush, child, hush!” said the Governor, with a frown. “Do not speak so loud. Where is the father of the child, Hester?” “I will not speak!” answered Hester, with a look of defiance. “And my child shall seek a Heavenly Father in vain!” “Woman, woman,” cried the Reverend Mr. Wilson, “what hast thou done? Thou hast made a mock of us all!” “Nay, not so, good Mr. Wilson,” said the Reverend Mr. Dimmesdale, with a smile. “She hath but followed the dictates of her own heart. And who are we, that we should judge her?” “True, true,” said Mr. Wilson. “But the child, the child! What is to be done with the child?” “Let her be brought up in the nurture and admonition of the Lord,” said Mr. Dimmesdale. “And let her be taught to fear God, and to keep his commandments.” “Amen!” said Mr. Wilson. “So let it be.” And the child was brought to the front of the scaffold, and placed in the arms of the Reverend Mr. Dimmesdale. He took the child in his arms, and looked at it with a strange mixture of pity and horror. “Child,” said he, “thy mother hath sinned. But thou art innocent. And I will be a father to thee.” He kissed the child, and then gave it back to its mother. “Woman,” said he, “thou hast heard what I have said. Wilt thou not speak the name of the man who is the father of thy child?” “I will not speak!” answered Hester. “And my child shall seek a Heavenly Father in vain!” “Be not silent from any mistaken pity and tenderness for him; for, believe me, Hester, though he were to step down from a high place, and stand beside thee on thy pedestal of shame, it would not be the worst punishment that could be inflicted, in this world, nor the worst torture hereafter!

He now drew back, with a long respiration. “Wondrous strength and generosity of a woman’s heart! She will not speak!”\nDiscerning the impracticable state of the poor culprit’s mind, the elder clergyman, who had carefully prepared himself for the occasion, addressed to the multitude a discourse on sin, in all its branches, but with continual reference to the ignominious letter. So forcibly did he dwell upon this symbol, for the hour or more during which his periods were rolling over the people’s heads, that it assumed new terrors in their imagination, and seemed to derive its scarlet hue from the flames of the infernal pit. Hester Prynne, meanwhile, kept her place upon the pedestal of shame, with glazed eyes, and an air of weary indifference. She had borne, that morning, all that nature could endure; and as her temperament was not of the order that escapes from too intense suffering by a swoon, her spirit could only shelter itself beneath a stony crust of insensibility, while the faculties of animal life remained entire. In this state, the voice of the preacher thundered remorselessly, but unavailingly, upon her ears. The infant, during the latter portion of her ordeal, pierced the air with its wailings and screams; she strove to hush it, mechanically, but seemed scarcely to sympathize with its trouble. With the same hard demeanor, she was led back to prison, and vanished from the public gaze within its iron-clamped portal. It was whispered, by those who peered after her, that the scarlet letter threw a lurid gleam along the dark passage-way of the interior.",

To say the truth, there was much need of professional assistance, not merely for Hester herself, but still more urgently for the child; who, drawing its sustenance from the maternal bosom, seemed to have drank in with it all the turmoil, the anguish and despair, which pervaded the mother’s system. It now writhed in convulsions of pain, and was a forcible type, in its little frame, of the moral agony which Hester Prynne had borne throughout the day.\nClosely following the jailer into the dismal apartment appeared that individual, of singular aspect, whose presence in the crowd had been of such deep interest to the wearer of the scarlet letter.

I will not forgive you.\" She drank the liquid, and then lay back on the bed. The physician sat down beside her, and took her hand. \"Hester,\" said he, \"you have wronged me.

Verily, the woman hath been like a possessed one; and there lacks little, that I should take in hand to drive Satan out of her with stripes.”\nThe stranger had entered the room with the characteristic quietude of the profession to which he announced himself as belonging. Nor did his demeanor change, when the withdrawal of the prison-keeper left him face to face with the woman, whose absorbed notice of him, in the crowd, had intimated so close a relation between himself and her. His first care was given to the child; whose cries, indeed, as she lay writhing on the trundle-bed, made it of peremptory necessity to postpone all other business to the task of soothing her. He examined the infant carefully, and then proceeded to unclasp a leathern case, which he took from beneath his dress. It appeared to contain medical preparations, one of which he mingled with a cup of water.\n“My old studies in alchemy,” observed he, “and my sojourn, for above a year past, among a people well versed in the kindly properties of simples, have made a better physician of me than many that claim the medical degree. Here, woman! The child is yours,—she is none of mine,—neither will she recognize my voice or aspect as a father’s. Administer this draught, therefore, with thine own hand.”\nHester repelled the offered medicine, at the same time gazing with strongly marked apprehension into his face.\n“Wouldst thou avenge thyself on the innocent babe?” whispered she.\n“Foolish woman!” responded the physician, half coldly, half soothingly. “What should ail me, to harm this misbegotten and miserable babe? The medicine is potent for good; and were it my child,—yea, mine own, as well as thine!—I could do no better for it.”\nAs she still hesitated, being, in fact, in no reasonable state of mind, he took the infant in his arms, and himself administered the draught. It soon proved its efficacy, and redeemed the leech’s pledge. The moans of the little patient subsided; its convulsive tossings gradually ceased; and, in a few moments, as is the custom of young children after relief from pain, it sank into a profound and dewy slumber.",

The individual addressed, a grave-faced deacon who had lingered with well-intentioned but intrusive solicitude, bowed his head and withdrew, casting a final, pitying glance upon the Reverend Mr. Dimmesdale. The door closed softly, leaving the physician and the minister in the hushed chamber. It was a room of scholarly austerity, lined with books, yet now imbued with the heavy air of sickness and unspoken sorrow. A pale shaft of afternoon sunlight, filtering through the leaded panes, illuminated dust motes dancing in the stillness and fell upon the minister’s face, highlighting its unnatural pallor and the deep lines etched by suffering. He lay back against the pillows, his breath shallow, his eyes closed, looking less like a man of God than a fragile, broken vessel. Roger Chillingworth approached the bedside with a quiet, measured tread. His face, once benevolent, now held a subtle, watchful intensity, like a hunter observing his prey from a distance. He drew a chair close and sat down, his gaze fixed upon the minister. For a long moment, he said nothing, merely observing the faint tremor in Dimmesdale’s hands, the restless movement of his head upon the pillow, the almost imperceptible groan that escaped his lips. “How fares it with you this afternoon, my good sir?” Chillingworth finally inquired, his voice low and smooth, yet with an undercurrent of clinical detachment. “Does the fever abate? Has the cordial brought you ease?” Dimmesdale opened his eyes slowly, revealing a depth of anguish that startled even the physician, accustomed as he was to the sight of human suffering. “Little ease, Master Chillingworth,” he murmured, his voice weak. “The body is a poor habitation for a soul so troubled. It rebels against the burden laid upon it.” Chillingworth nodded slowly, his eyes never leaving the minister’s face. “Indeed,” he said. “And often, the ailment of the body is but a symptom of a deeper malady, a disease of the spirit. Have you, my revered friend, searched your soul for the root of this affliction? Is there aught that lies hidden, festering within, that denies you peace and saps your strength?” He leaned forward slightly, his gaze piercing. “Men of your sacred calling are wont to conceal their human frailties, their sins, even from their physicians. But a hidden sin, a secret sorrow, can be like a canker in the soul, consuming the life force. Confession, they say, is good for the soul, and sometimes, for the body too.” Dimmesdale flinched visibly at the word “sin.” A flush, feverish and unnatural, spread across his cheeks, only to recede, leaving him paler than before. He turned his head away, his eyes fixed on the wall, avoiding Chillingworth’s penetrating gaze. “Nay, Master Chillingworth"

It is not poison!” “I will not drink,” repeated she, “unless thou tell me who thou art, and what is thy purpose.” “Thou hast long had time to know me, Hester,” replied he, calmly. “Except for that one brief moment, when I hid my face at the outcry of the multitude, I have been here ever since, standing beside thy scaffold, in the pillory, and on the market-place.

Come, Hester, be not a child. A moment since, thou wast ready to die for despair; and now thou fearest to live, lest I should do thee some mischief! Nay, if I thought to injure thee, would I not have done it long ago? Would I not have left thee to the natural course, so that death should have been thy portion?

I know not Lethe nor Nepenthe,” continued he; “but I have learned many new secrets in the wilderness, and here, by this bedside, and in this dark prison-chamber, I shall learn yet more. Keep thy thoughts within thy heart, lest it be wrenched thence, and tortured, and dislocated among the joints of thy moral system. Come, take the medicine with a good heart, and be cured!” He poured the draught into a glass, and held it to her lips. “I will not drink,” said Hester, turning aside her head. “Thou knowest this medicine will do me good. It is not poison!” “I will not drink,” repeated she, “unless thou tell me who thou art, and what is thy purpose.” “Thou hast long had time to know me, Hester,” replied he, calmly. “Except for that one brief moment, when I hid my face at the outcry of the multitude, I have been here ever since, standing beside thy scaffold, in the pillory, and on the market-place. Beautiful as thou art, thou art not so beautiful but that I may look closely at thee. Thou art not so beautiful but that I may see the scarlet letter glow and burn upon thy breast. And thou art not so beautiful but that I may see the stain it has cast upon thy soul!” As he spoke, he laid his finger upon the scarlet letter. It seemed to Hester—or, perchance, it was only her imagination—that a burning heat shot forth from the letter, as if it had been red-hot, and seared into her flesh. “Beshrew me, but I have a strange fancy,” remarked he, “that this letter has a peculiar power of communicating itself to the beholder’s heart, and of making itself felt there. Come, Hester, be not a child. A moment since, thou wast ready to die for despair; and now thou fearest to live, lest I should do thee some mischief! Nay, if I thought to injure thee, would I not have done it long ago? Would I not have left thee to the natural course, so that death should have been thy portion? No, Hester, I am not like thee, a woman of passionate impulse. I am a man of thought, and have a purpose. Live, therefore, and bear thy sentence! Thou wilt fail me, in thy livelihood, if thou diest! So, drink it all, and do not leave a drop!” He held the cup to her lips again. She drank it, and, as",

What sayest thou, Hester Prynne?  Hath not this man, whom I have sought so long, been found in the person of thy paramour?\"  \"I will not speak!\" answered Hester, turning pale and trembling.  \"Hold thy peace, then!\" said he, with a smile of dark triumph.  \"Let him hide himself in whatever hole he may, I shall find him out!  There shall be no peace for him, early nor late; no pleasure, no rest.  He shall become the subject of my deepest study.  As I find what is good for him, I shall apply it, for his sake.  As I find what is evil, I shall also apply that, for my own sake.  And now, Hester, I have a pledge to demand of thee.  Thou hast kept the secret of thy paramour.  Keep, likewise, mine!  There are here no physicians; nor, if there were, should I consult any one of them.  I know my own work, and shall do it with mine own hands.  But thou, Hester, must keep my secret!  Thou must tell no man, for any cause, that I am thy husband!\"  \"Why dost thou seek this pledge of me?\" asked Hester, trembling.  \"Because,\" replied he, \"I will not be known!  There are reasons why I should not become visible to the world, as the wronged husband of a faithless woman.  Reasons, too, why I should remain obscure, and seek my own objects according to my own pleasure.  I shall not stand between thee and thy paramour; but thou shalt not betray me!\"  \"I will not betray thee,\" answered Hester, \"lest I should be false to the pledge I have already given.\"  \"So much the better,\" said he.  \"And now, Hester, I have a purpose to accomplish.  I came hither to find a man who had wronged me.  I have found him.  I shall not take his life, but I shall have his soul!

I shall remain in this settlement.  My home is where thou art, and where the father of thy child is.  There is a bond between us, Hester, a bond of mutual crime.  We have wronged each other.

This public veneration, this saintly reputation, is a mockery, a torture! It is a bond, yes, but one that severs me from all true human sympathy. I live a lie, Hester, a perpetual, gnawing falsehood that consumes my very soul. I crave a connection, a shared burden, even if it be in darkness and shame, rather than this glittering, hollow pedestal of deceit. My spirit is crushed beneath the weight of this unacknowledged sin. I look upon these people, my flock, and their reverence is a lash upon my back. I see their faith in me, and it is a mirror reflecting my own monstrous hypocrisy. I need to share this burden, to have one soul on earth to whom I am not a living lie. Is not this bond, this shared secret, the only truth left to us? The only ground upon which our feet can stand without sinking into the abyss of utter isolation? Tell me, Hester, is there no solace in knowing that another heart beats with the same guilty rhythm as your own? That the same brand, though hidden, is burned into another's flesh?” His words poured forth, a torrent of long-suppressed anguish, revealing the depth of his torment and the desperate hope he placed in their shared transgression as a means of connection. Hester listened, her heart aching with a mixture of pity and fear, recognizing the profound suffering that had warped his once-noble spirit."

Her prison-door was thrown open, and she came forth into the sunshine, which, falling on all alike, seemed, to her sick and morbid heart, as if meant for no other purpose than to reveal the scarlet letter on her breast. Perhaps there was a more real torture in her first unattended footsteps from the threshold of the prison, than even in the procession and spectacle that have been described, where she was made the common infamy, at which all mankind was summoned to point its finger. Then, she was supported by an unnatural tension of the nerves, and by all the combative energy of her character, which enabled her to convert the scene into a kind of lurid triumph. It was, moreover, a separate and insulated event, to occur but once in her lifetime, and to meet which, therefore, reckless of economy, she might call up the vital strength that would have sufficed for many quiet years. The very law that condemned her—a giant of stern features, but with vigor to support, as well as to annihilate, in his iron arm—had held her up, through the terrible ordeal of her ignominy. But now, with this unattended walk from her prison-door, began the daily custom; and she must either sustain and carry it forward by the ordinary resources of her nature, or sink beneath it. She could no longer borrow from the future to help her through the present grief. To-morrow would bring its own trial with it; so would the next day, and so would the next; each its own trial, and yet the very same that was now so unutterably grievous to be borne. The days of the far-off future would toil onward, still with the same burden for her to take up, and bear along with her, but never to fling down; for the accumulating days, and added years, would pile up their misery upon the heap of shame. Throughout them all, giving up her individuality, she would become the general symbol at which the preacher and moralist might point, and in which they might vivify and embody their images of woman’s frailty and sinful passion. Thus the young and pure would be taught to look at her, with the scarlet letter flaming on her breast,—at her, the child of honorable parents,—at her, the mother of a babe, that would hereafter be a woman,—at her, who had once been innocent,—as the figure, the body, the reality of sin.

She possessed an art that sufficed, even in a land that afforded comparatively little scope for its exercise, to supply food for her thriving infant and herself. It was the art—then, as now, almost the only one within a woman’s grasp—of needlework. She bore on her breast, in the curiously embroidered letter, a specimen of her delicate and imaginative skill, of which the dames of a court might gladly have availed themselves, to add the richer and more spiritual adornment of human ingenuity to their fabrics of silk and gold. Here, indeed, in the sable simplicity that generally characterized the Puritanic modes of dress, there might be an infrequent call for the finer productions of her handiwork. Yet the taste of the age, demanding whatever was elaborate in compositions of this kind, did not fail to extend its influence over our stern progenitors, who had cast behind them so many fashions which it might seem harder to dispense with. Public ceremonies, such as ordinations, the installation of magistrates, and all that could give majesty to the forms in which a new government manifested itself to the people, were, as a matter of policy, marked by a stately and well-conducted ceremonial, and a sombre, but yet a studied magnificence. Deep ruffs, painfully wrought bands, and gorgeously embroidered gloves, were all deemed necessary to the official state of men assuming the reins of power; and were readily allowed to individuals dignified by rank or wealth, even while sumptuary laws forbade these and similar extravagances to the plebeian order. In the array of funerals, too,—whether for the apparel of the dead body, or to typify, by manifold emblematic devices of sable cloth and snowy lawn, the sorrow of the survivors,—there was a frequent and characteristic demand for such labor as Hester Prynne could supply. Baby-linen—for babies then wore robes of state—afforded still another possibility of toil and emolument.",

It was the art of the needle. In fine, plain sewing she was greatly skilled; nor did she lack the more ethereal grace of fancywork.

And as Hester Prynne had no friends to whom she could give the outpouring of her heart, she instead bestowed all her rich and luxuriant fancy upon the gorgeous embroidery of the scarlet letter, which was her daily and lifelong occupation, and which she had never since taken off. The letter was the richest and most elaborate piece of needlework that she had ever wrought. The stitch was so fine, so delicate, that it seemed to have been done by fairy fingers; and the design was so intricate, so fanciful, so full of strange, wild flowers, and so interwoven with the tendrils of a luxuriant vine, that it was difficult to believe it was the work of mortal hands. It was, in short, a masterpiece of art, and a triumph of skill. Even the aristocratic dames, who had been accustomed to the splendors of the English court, and who had brought with them a taste for the most elaborate and costly attire, could not but admire the richness and beauty of the scarlet letter.

Her own dress was of the coarsest materials and the most sombre hue; with only that one ornament,—the scarlet letter,—which it was her doom to wear. The child’s attire, on the other hand, was distinguished by a fanciful, or, we might rather say, a fantastic ingenuity, which served, indeed, to heighten the airy charm that early began to develop itself in the little girl, but which appeared to have also a deeper meaning. We may speak further of it hereafter. Except for that small expenditure in the decoration of her infant, Hester bestowed all her superfluous means in charity, on wretches less miserable than herself, and who not unfrequently insulted the hand that fed them. Much of the time, which she might readily have applied to the better efforts of her art, she employed in making coarse garments for the poor. It is probable that there was an idea of penance in this mode of occupation, and that she offered up a real sacrifice of enjoyment, in devoting so many hours to such rude handiwork. She had in her nature a rich, voluptuous, Oriental characteristic,—a taste for the gorgeously beautiful, which, save in the exquisite productions of her needle, found nothing else, in all the possibilities of her life, to exercise itself upon. Women derive a pleasure, incomprehensible to the other sex, from the delicate toil of the needle. To Hester Prynne it might have been a mode of expressing, and therefore soothing, the passion of her life. Like all other joys, she rejected it as sin.

With her native energy of character, and rare capacity, it could not entirely cast her off, although it had set a mark upon her, more intolerable to a woman’s heart than that which branded the brow of Cain. In all her intercourse with society, however, there was nothing that made her feel as if she belonged to it. Every gesture, every word, and even the silence of those with whom she came in contact, implied, and often expressed, that she was banished, and as much alone as if she inhabited another sphere, or communicated with the common nature by other organs and senses than the rest of human kind. She stood apart from moral interests, yet close beside them, like a ghost that revisits the familiar fireside, and can no longer make itself seen or felt; no more smile with the household joy, nor mourn with the kindred sorrow; or, should it succeed in manifesting its forbidden sympathy, awakening only terror and horrible repugnance. These emotions, in fact, and its bitterest scorn besides, seemed to be the sole portion that she retained in the universal heart. It was not an age of delicacy; and her position, although she understood it well, and was in little danger of forgetting it, was often brought before her vivid self-perception, like a new anguish, by the rudest touch upon the tenderest spot. The poor, as we have already said, whom she sought out to be the objects of her bounty, often reviled the hand that was stretched forth to succor them. Dames of elevated rank, likewise, whose doors she entered in the way of her occupation, were accustomed to distil drops of bitterness into her heart; sometimes through that alchemy of quiet malice, by which women can concoct a subtle poison from ordinary trifles; and sometimes, also, by a coarser expression, that fell upon the sufferer’s defenceless breast like a rough blow upon an ulcerated wound. Hester had schooled herself long and well; she never responded to these attacks, save by a flush of crimson that rose irrepressibly over her pale cheek, and again subsided into the depths of her bosom. She was patient,—a martyr, indeed,—but she forbore to pray for her enemies; lest, in spite of her forgiving aspirations, the words of the blessing should stubbornly twist themselves into a curse.",

She grew to have a dread of children; for they had imbibed from their parents a vague idea of something horrible in this dreary woman, gliding silently through the town, with never any companion but one only child. Therefore, first allowing her to pass, they pursued her at a distance with shrill cries, and the utterance of a word that had no distinct purport to their own minds, but was none the less terrible to her, as proceeding from lips that babbled it unconsciously. It seemed to argue so wide a diffusion of her shame, that all nature knew of it; it could have caused her no deeper pang, had the leaves of the trees whispered the dark story among themselves,—had the summer breeze murmured about it,—had the wintry blast shrieked it aloud!

Had Hester sinned alone?\nHer imagination was somewhat affected, and, had she been of a softer moral and intellectual fibre, would have been still more so, by the strange and solitary anguish of her life. Walking to and fro, with those lonely footsteps, in the little world with which she was outwardly connected, it now and then appeared to Hester,—if altogether fancy, it was nevertheless too potent to be resisted,—she felt or fancied, then, that the scarlet letter had endowed her with a new sense. She shuddered to believe, yet could not help believing, that it gave her a sympathetic knowledge of the hidden sin in other hearts. She was terror-stricken by the revelations that were thus made. What were they? Could they be other than the insidious whispers of the bad angel, who would fain have persuaded the struggling woman, as yet only half his victim, that the outward guise of purity was but a lie, and that, if truth were everywhere to be shown, a scarlet letter would blaze forth on many a bosom besides Hester Prynne’s? Or, must she receive those intimations—so obscure, yet so distinct—as truth? In all her miserable experience, there was nothing else so awful and so loathsome as this sense. It perplexed, as well as shocked her, by the irreverent inopportuneness of the occasions that brought it into vivid action. Sometimes the red infamy upon her breast would give a sympathetic throb, as she passed near a venerable minister or magistrate, the model of piety and justice, to whom that age of antique reverence looked up, as to a mortal man in fellowship with angels. “What evil thing is at hand?” would Hester say to herself. Lifting her reluctant eyes, there would be nothing human within the scope of view, save the form of this earthly saint! Again, a mystic sisterhood would contumaciously assert itself, as she met the sanctified frown of some matron, who, according to the rumor of all tongues, had kept cold snow within her bosom throughout life. That unsunned snow in the matron’s bosom, and the burning shame on Hester Prynne’s,—what had the two in common? Or, once more, the electric thrill would give her warning,—“Behold, Hester, here is a companion!”—and, looking up, she would detect the eyes of a young maiden glancing at the scarlet letter, shyly and aside, and quickly averted with a faint, chill crimson in her cheeks; as if her purity were somewhat sullied by that momentary glance. O Fiend, whose talisman was that fatal symbol, wouldst thou leave nothing, whether in youth or age, for this poor sinner to revere?—such loss of faith is ever one of the saddest results of sin. Be it accepted as a proof that all was not corrupt in this poor victim of her own frailty, and man’s hard law, that Hester Prynne yet struggled to believe that no fellow-mortal was guilty like herself.\nThe vulgar, who, in those dreary old times, were always contributing a grotesque horror to what interested their imaginations, had a story about the scarlet letter which we might readily work up into a terrific legend. They averred, that the symbol was not mere scarlet cloth, tinged in an earthly dye-pot, but was red-hot with infernal fire, and could be seen glowing all alight, whenever Hester Prynne walked abroad in the night-time. And we must needs say, it seared Hester’s bosom so deeply, that perhaps there was more truth in the rumor than our modern incredulity may be inclined to admit.",

Was she, then, so ill of condition, that the sympathy of a human breast held nothing for her, unless she cast it away as an unworthy boon? Could she receive no kindness, no pity, no natural regard, without immediately holding up the scarlet letter to the world, and making it the memorial of her inexpiable sin?

This morbid meddling of conscience with an immaterial matter betokened, it is to be feared, no healthy state of mind. An accustomed eye had likewise another peculiarity. We have spoken of the world's scorn, the children's taunts, the minister's reverend frown, the universal murmur and scoff that pursued her footsteps. But, at times, a fearful doubt strove to possess her soul. Was she ever to feel again the sweet breath of pure, unpolluted inward life, and know that she was human, and human only,—not to be excluded from human law, nor human sympathy? And sometimes, a thrill of pain would shoot through her heart, and she would look up with a quick, wild glance, and behold, standing at a distance, a man who had been among the foremost to cast a stone at her. Then she would feel the full weight of her ignominy, and the iron enter into her soul. It was a sad, but not an altogether unjoyful, life. She was not an outcast, but a being set apart, and consecrated to a high and holy purpose. She was a living sermon, a parable of sin, with the scarlet letter for a text. And, as is the custom of the preachers of that time, she applied the text to herself, and to all around her. She saw in the faces of men and women, old and young, a likeness to herself. She saw in their eyes, a look of pain, of sorrow, of remorse, of guilt. She saw in their hearts, a hidden sin, a secret shame, a buried crime. And she felt a strange, wild sympathy with them, as if they were her kindred, her brethren, her sisters, in the family of sin. This was the effect of the scarlet letter. It had given her a sympathetic knowledge of the hidden sin in other hearts. She shuddered to believe it, and yet she could not help believing it. It was a terrible gift. It was a curse and a blessing. It was a mark of shame and a badge of honor. It was a symbol of sin and a sign of salvation. It was a letter of infamy and a letter of grace. It was a scarlet letter. And it was her life. The public manifested all the features of a highly moral and religious community. There was rigid truth on every tongue, a holy awe on every face, a pious reverence in every heart. And yet, the scarlet letter had taught Hester Prynne—what was beyond the scope of other teachers—the lesson that the outward guise may be fair, and yet the soul within be foul. She had been accustomed to look upon the clergyman as a being of saintly purity, and to reverence the magistrate as a man of spotless integrity. But, now, she saw that the clergyman was a sinner, and the magistrate a criminal. She saw that the saintliest of men were but whited sepulchres, full of dead men's bones, and all uncleanness. She saw that the purest of women were but painted harlots, with fair outsides and foul hearts. She saw that the whole world was but a vast lazar-house, where all were sick of sin, and all needed a physician. This was the lesson that the scarlet letter had taught her. And it was a bitter lesson. It was a lesson that she would fain have unlearned. But she could not. It was burned into her heart, as the letter was burned into her breast. And it was a lesson that she would never forget. It was a lesson that she would carry with her to the grave. And it was a lesson that she would teach to her child. The letter was the symbol of her sin, and the child was the fruit of her sin. And the child was a living letter, a human symbol, a visible sign of the sin that had been committed. And the child was a constant reminder of the sin, and a constant source of pain. And yet, the child was a source of joy, and a source of hope. For the child was a pledge of future happiness, and a promise of future good. And the child was a link between the mother and the world. And the child was a bond between the mother and God.

It was not sympathy that she sought, nor did she often find it. The eyes that most frequently rested upon the scarlet letter were cold and pitiless, or sternly condemnatory, or merely filled with a coarse and idle curiosity. These she had learned to bear, as the tree bears the blight, or the rock the ceaseless buffetings of the tide. Her spirit had become, in a great measure, callous to their impact. But the gaze that brought this strange, fleeting solace was of a different nature. It was an eye that seemed to probe, not with malice, but with a profound, almost painful recognition. It was as if the beholder, in that brief instant, acknowledged the existence of the burden, saw the weight of it pressing upon her soul, and by that very act of seeing, lessened its solitary pressure. It was a communion, silent and involuntary, in the vast, lonely desert of her penance. She could not tell whose eye it was, or why it possessed this singular power. It might be the glance of a fellow-sufferer, one who bore a hidden anguish beneath a placid exterior, and whose own secret sorrow enabled him to perceive and respond to hers. Or it might be the eye of one who, through deep thought or bitter experience, had arrived at a knowledge of the dark complexities of the human heart, and could look upon her sin and its symbol, not with the shallow judgment of the crowd, but with a deeper, more tragic understanding. This rare gaze was like a single drop of water in a parched land, not enough to quench the thirst, but a reminder that water existed. It was a hint that she was not utterly alone in the universe, that there was at least one other soul capable of perceiving the reality of her suffering, beyond the mere outward show of shame. Yet, even this relief was fraught with a subtle pain. For the eye that saw so deeply into her condition might also be one that knew, or suspected, the full extent of the truth, the hidden connections that bound her fate to others. It might be the eye of the minister, whose own secret agony she sometimes felt, like a vibration in the air, when he stood near her. Or it might be the eye of the physician, whose chilling scrutiny seemed to pierce through all disguises, and whose knowledge, she instinctively felt, was a source of profound danger. Thus, even the moments of shared agony were tinged with apprehension. The scarlet letter was not merely a brand upon her breast; it was a lens through which she viewed the world, and through which the world, in turn, viewed her. It distorted perceptions, magnified emotions, and cast a perpetual shadow over her existence. It was her companion, her tormentor, her teacher. It had stripped her bare of conventional defenses, forcing her to confront the raw truth of her being and the harsh realities of the society that condemned her. It had isolated her, yet in that isolation, it had also granted her a strange, wild freedom of thought. She stood outside the bounds of ordinary law and custom, a marked woman, an outcast. And in this state of perpetual otherness, she sometimes caught glimpses of truths hidden from those who walked the straight and narrow path of"

The child had a native grace which does not invariably coexist with faultless beauty; its attire, however simple, always impressed the beholder as if it were the very garb that precisely became it best. But little Pearl was not clad in rustic weeds. Her mother, with a morbid purpose that may be better understood hereafter, had bought the richest tissues that could be procured, and allowed her imaginative faculty its full play in the arrangement and decoration of the dresses which the child wore, before the public eye. So magnificent was the small figure, when thus arrayed, and such was the splendor of Pearl’s own proper beauty, shining through the gorgeous robes which might have extinguished a paler loveliness, that there was an absolute circle of radiance around her, on the darksome cottage floor. And yet a russet gown, torn and soiled with the child’s rude play, made a picture of her just as perfect. Pearl’s aspect was imbued with a spell of infinite variety; in this one child there were many children, comprehending the full scope between the wild-flower prettiness of a peasant-baby, and the pomp, in little, of an infant princess.

The child could not be made amenable to rules. In giving her existence, a great law had been broken; and the result was a being whose elements were perhaps beautiful and brilliant, but all in disorder; or with an order peculiar to themselves, amidst which the point of variety and arrangement was difficult or impossible to be discovered. Hester could only account for the child’s character—and even then most vaguely and imperfectly—by recalling what she herself had been, during that momentous period while Pearl was imbibing her soul from the spiritual world, and her bodily frame from its material of earth. The mother’s impassioned state had been the medium through which were transmitted to the unborn infant the rays of its moral life; and, however white and clear originally, they had taken the deep stains of crimson and gold, the fiery lustre, the black shadow, and the untempered light of the intervening substance. Above all, the warfare of Hester’s spirit, at that epoch, was perpetuated in Pearl. She could recognize her wild, desperate, defiant mood, the flightiness of her temper, and even some of the very cloud-shapes of gloom and despondency that had brooded in her heart.

The frown, the harsh rebuke, the frequent application of the rod, enjoined by Scriptural authority, were used, not merely in the way of punishment for actual offences, but as a wholesome regimen for the growth and promotion of all childish virtues. Hester Prynne, nevertheless, the lonely mother of this one child, ran little risk of erring on the side of undue severity. Mindful, however, of her own errors and misfortunes, she early sought to impose a tender, but strict control over the infant immortality that was committed to her charge. But the task was beyond her skill. After testing both smiles and frowns, and proving that neither mode of treatment possessed any calculable influence, Hester was ultimately compelled to stand aside, and permit the child to be swayed by her own impulses. Physical compulsion or restraint was effectual, of course, while it lasted. As to any other kind of discipline, whether addressed to her mind or heart, little Pearl might or might not be within its reach, in accordance with the caprice that ruled the moment. Her mother, while Pearl was yet an infant, grew acquainted with a certain peculiar look, that warned her when it would be labor thrown away to insist, persuade, or plead. It was a look so intelligent, yet inexplicable, so perverse, sometimes so malicious, but generally accompanied by a wild flow of spirits, that Hester could not help questioning, at such moments, whether Pearl were a human child. She seemed rather an airy sprite, which, after playing its fantastic sports for a little while upon the cottage floor, would flit away with a mocking smile. Whenever that look appeared in her wild, bright, deeply black eyes, it invested her with a strange remoteness and intangibility; it was as if she were hovering in the air and might vanish, like a glimmering light, that comes we know not whence, and goes we know not whither. Beholding it, Hester was constrained to rush towards the child,—to pursue the little elf in the flight which she invariably began,—to snatch her to her bosom, with a close pressure and earnest kisses,—not so much from overflowing love, as to assure herself that Pearl was flesh and blood, and not utterly delusive. But Pearl’s laugh, when she was caught, though full of merriment and music, made her mother more doubtful than before.",

            "prefix-probing": "The discipline of the family, in those days, was of a far more rigid kind than now. Children were not indulged with the freedom and levity that modern times permit; rather, they were seen as miniature adults, burdened with the same potential for sin and requiring constant vigilance and correction. The stern countenances of parents, the sombre hue of their attire, and the pervasive atmosphere of religious austerity cast a long shadow over the domestic sphere. Play was often discouraged as idleness, and laughter, unless it was the constrained mirth of a Sabbath gathering, was viewed with suspicion. Obedience was paramount, enforced not merely by parental authority but by the ever-present threat of divine displeasure. The rod was not spared, and the spirits of the young were systematically subdued, molded into the desired pattern of piety and submission. There was little room for the spontaneous joy or the innocent curiosity that we now associate with childhood. Instead, the catechism was learned by rote, sermons were endured with enforced stillness, and the fear of God was instilled as the primary motivator for good behaviour. This iron rule extended to every aspect of life, from the morning prayers to the evening examination of conscience. The home was, in essence, a smaller, more intimate version of the meeting-house, a place where the soul's salvation was the constant, overriding concern, and earthly comforts or childish delights were deemed secondary, if not outright dangerous distractions. This severity, while perhaps intended to build strong moral character, often succeeded only in creating a generation of outwardly compliant but inwardly conflicted individuals, many of whom carried the scars of this harsh upbringing into their adult lives, sometimes manifesting in unexpected and destructive ways, a testament to the human spirit's struggle against such unyielding constraint and the deep, hidden currents that flowed beneath the surface of that seemingly placid, God-fearing society. The weight of original sin was a palpable presence in every household, a burden placed squarely upon the shoulders of the young, who were taught from their earliest years that their natural inclinations were towards wickedness and that only through constant self-denial and rigorous adherence to religious doctrine could they hope to escape eternal damnation. This relentless pressure to conform, to suppress natural impulses, and to live a life of outward piety often led to a profound disconnect between appearance and reality, a theme that would resonate deeply within the lives of those touched by the scarlet letter."

Then, perhaps,—for there was no foreseeing how it might affect her,—Pearl would frown, and clench her little fist, and harden her small features into a stern, unsympathizing look of discontent. Not seldom, she would laugh anew, and louder than before, like a thing incapable and unintelligent of human sorrow. Or—but this more rarely happened—she would be convulsed with a rage of grief, and sob out her love for her mother, in broken words, and seem intent on proving that she had a heart, by breaking it. Yet Hester was hardly safe in confiding herself to that gusty tenderness; it passed, as suddenly as it came. Brooding over all these matters, the mother felt like one who has evoked a spirit, but, by some irregularity in the process of conjuration, has failed to win the master-word that should control this new and incomprehensible intelligence. Her only real comfort was when the child lay in the placidity of sleep. Then she was sure of her, and tasted hours of quiet, sad, delicious happiness; until—perhaps with that perverse expression glimmering from beneath her opening lids—little Pearl awoke!",

          "text_segment": "How soon—with what strange rapidity, indeed!—did Pearl arrive at an age that was capable of social intercourse, beyond the mother’s ever-ready smile and nonsense-words! And then what a happiness would it have been, could Hester Prynne have heard her clear, bird-like voice mingling with the uproar of other childish voices, and have distinguished and unravelled her own darling’s tones, amid all the entangled outcry of a group of sportive children! But this could never be. Pearl was a born outcast of the infantile world. An imp of evil, emblem and product of sin, she had no right among christened infants. Nothing was more remarkable than the instinct, as it seemed, with which the child comprehended her loneliness; the destiny that had drawn an inviolable circle round about her; the whole peculiarity, in short, of her position in respect to other children. Never, since her release from prison, had Hester met the public gaze without her. In all her walks about the town, Pearl, too, was there; first as the babe in arms, and afterwards as the little girl, small companion of her mother, holding a forefinger with her whole grasp, and tripping along at the rate of three or four footsteps to one of Hester’s. She saw the children of the settlement, on the grassy margin of the street, or at the domestic thresholds, disporting themselves in such grim fashion as the Puritanic nurture would permit; playing at going to church, perchance; or at scourging Quakers; or taking scalps in a sham-fight with the Indians; or scaring one another with freaks of imitative witchcraft. Pearl saw, and gazed intently, but never sought to make acquaintance. If spoken to, she would not speak again. If the children gathered about her, as they sometimes did, Pearl would grow positively terrible in her puny wrath, snatching up stones to fling at them, with shrill, incoherent exclamations, that made her mother tremble, because they had so much the sound of a witch’s anathemas in some unknown tongue.\nThe truth was, that the little Puritans, being of the most intolerant brood that ever lived, had got a vague idea of something outlandish, unearthly, or at variance with ordinary fashions, in the mother and child; and therefore scorned them in their hearts, and not unfrequently reviled them with their tongues. Pearl felt the sentiment, and requited it with the bitterest hatred that can be supposed to rankle in a childish bosom. These outbreaks of a fierce temper had a kind of value, and even comfort, for her mother; because there was at least an intelligible earnestness in the mood, instead of the fitful caprice that so often thwarted her in the child’s manifestations. It appalled her, nevertheless, to discern here, again, a shadowy reflection of the evil that had existed in herself. All this enmity and passion had Pearl inherited, by inalienable right, out of Hester’s heart. Mother and daughter stood together in the same circle of seclusion from human society; and in the nature of the child seemed to be perpetuated those unquiet elements that had distracted Hester Prynne before Pearl’s birth, but had since begun to be soothed away by the softening influences of maternity.\nAt home, within and around her mother’s cottage, Pearl wanted not a wide and various circle of acquaintance. The spell of life went forth from her ever-creative spirit, and communicated itself to a thousand objects, as a torch kindles a flame wherever it may be applied. The unlikeliest materials—a stick, a bunch of rags, a flower—were the puppets of Pearl’s witchcraft, and, without undergoing any outward change, became spiritually adapted to whatever drama occupied the stage of her inner world. Her one baby-voice served a multitude of imaginary personages, old and young, to talk withal. The pine-trees, aged, black and solemn, and flinging groans and other melancholy utterances on the breeze, needed little transformation to figure as Puritan elders; the ugliest weeds of the garden were their children, whom Pearl smote down and uprooted, most unmercifully. It was wonderful, the vast variety of forms into which she threw her intellect, with no continuity, indeed, but darting up and dancing, always in a state of preternatural activity,—soon sinking down, as if exhausted by so rapid and feverish a tide of life,—and succeeded by other shapes of a similar wild energy. It was like nothing so much as the phantasmagoric play of the northern lights. In the mere exercise of the fancy, however, and the sportiveness of a growing mind, there might be little more than was observable in other children of bright faculties; except as Pearl, in the dearth of human playmates, was thrown more upon the visionary throng which she created. The singularity lay in the hostile feelings with which the child regarded all these offspring of her own heart and mind. She never created a friend, but seemed always to be sowing broadcast the dragon’s teeth, whence sprung a harvest of armed enemies, against whom she rushed to battle. It was inexpressibly sad—then what depth of sorrow to a mother, who felt in her own heart the cause!—to observe, in one so young, this constant recognition of an adverse world, and so fierce a training of the energies that were to make good her cause, in the contest that must ensue.",

Pearl’s inevitable tendency to hover about the limits of the actual world, and wander into the regions of the imaginative, would have looked not unlike electricity, or a vital magnetism, which had shocked Hester’s spirit with a strange thrill. But she was used to her wildness now. Pearl could not be made amenable to rules. In giving her existence, a great law had been broken; and the result was a being whose elements were perhaps beautiful and brilliant, but all in disorder; or with an order peculiar to themselves, amidst which the point of variety and arrangement was difficult or impossible to be discovered. Hester could only account for the child’s character—and even then most vaguely and imperfectly—by recalling what she herself had been, during that wild outbreak of a passion, which had been the origin of Pearl. She remembered betwixt a smile and a shudder, the wild energy of her spirit, which had borne her onward like a tempestuous blast.

            "prefix-probing": "How soon—with what strange rapidity, indeed!—did Pearl arrive at an age that was capable of social intercourse, beyond the mother’s ever-ready smile and nonsense-words! And yet, on the other hand, how much longer she continued to be an infant, in the absence of all the ordinary methods by which children are brought into relation with the world! The mother’s part, at best, was perilous only, and so much the more perilous the nearer she approached to the moment when Pearl might begin to receive impressions from the outward and spiritual world. There was a trait in Pearl’s nature which rendered her incapable of being, or even seeming, amenable to rules. Her infantile sports were not those of other children. She never mingled with a crowd of little ones in their sports. If ever they did venture to come near her, Pearl, at a very early age, would become the most terrible little elf that ever tormented its mother, or mocked at the community. The unlikeliest mode of amusement, to a mother’s heart, was the warfare of Pearl, with such imaginary foes as she could conjure up. These she assailed with the utmost ferocity, and broke them into fragments by her passionate gestures. She had no other playmate than the mother, and the mother, being herself a outcast, was not likely to train her child in the ways of ordinary children. Pearl was a child of the forest, a creature of impulse and wildness, with an energy that seemed inexhaustible. Her eyes, dark and deep, held a strange intelligence, and her movements were quick and unpredictable, like those of a bird or a squirrel. She was never still, always flitting, dancing, or running, her bright garments a splash of color against the somber background of Hester’s life. The scarlet letter, which Hester wore on her bosom, was the first object of which Pearl seemed to take notice. From her earliest infancy, she had been drawn to it, reaching out her tiny fingers to touch it, to grasp it, to rub her cheek against it. It was as if the letter possessed a strange fascination for her, a magnetic pull that she could not resist. As she grew older, her fascination with the letter only deepened. She would point to it, laugh at it, and sometimes, in moments of childish cruelty, she would torment her mother by mimicking the gestures of those who scorned the letter. She would arrange pebbles or flowers in the shape of the letter, or trace it in the sand with her toe. It was a constant presence in her life, a symbol that she seemed to understand on some primal level, even before she could comprehend its meaning. The letter was, in a way, her only companion, besides her mother. It was the object around which her world revolved, the focal point of her early consciousness. Hester often wondered if Pearl was aware of the pain the letter caused her, or if she simply saw it as a bright, interesting object. But there was a knowing look in Pearl’s eyes sometimes, a shrewdness that suggested she understood more than she let on. She was a child of the scarlet letter, born out of sin and shame, and she seemed to embody the wild, untamed spirit that the letter represented. She was a living, breathing symbol of Hester’s transgression, a constant reminder of the sin that had brought her into existence. And yet, she was also a source of joy and comfort to Hester, a precious jewel that she guarded fiercely. Pearl was a paradox, a child of light and darkness, innocence and knowledge, joy and sorrow. She was a mystery, a riddle that Hester could not solve. She was her mother’s punishment and her reward, her cross and her crown. She was Pearl. The other children of the settlement, when they saw Pearl, would shrink away in fear or curiosity. Their mothers had warned them about the strange child who lived with the woman who wore the scarlet letter. They called her names – “elf-child,” “imp,” “demon offspring” – and they would throw stones at her from a distance. But Pearl never cried or ran away. Instead, she would stand her ground, her eyes flashing, and she would hurl back imaginary missiles at her tormentors, or she would let out a wild, piercing cry that would send them scattering. She was a creature of the wild, more at home in the forest than in the narrow streets of the Puritan settlement. She would spend hours playing by herself in the woods, talking to the trees and the animals, creating her own world of fantasy and adventure. She was a child of nature, untamed and free, and she resisted all attempts to confine her within the strict boundaries of Puritan society. Hester tried to teach her the catechism, to instill in her the principles of their faith, but Pearl would only mock her, twisting the words into nonsense rhymes or asking impertinent questions. She seemed to have an innate resistance to all forms of authority, a rebellious spirit that could not be broken. She was a law unto herself, a creature of impulse and passion. Her relationship with Hester was complex and often fraught with tension. Pearl was demanding and capricious, and she would often test her mother’s patience with her wilfulness and her strange questions. She seemed to delight in tormenting Hester, in probing the depths of her mother’s pain. She would ask about the scarlet letter, about the man who had given it to her, about the reason why Hester wore it. And Hester, unable to lie to her child, would struggle to find words that could explain the inexplicable. Pearl was a mirror in which Hester saw her own sin reflected, a constant reminder of the consequences of her actions. But she was also a source of strength and resilience, a reason to keep living, to keep fighting. Pearl was the living embodiment of Hester’s hope, the promise of a future that might be different from the past. She was a child of the wilderness, a creature of instinct and intuition, and she seemed to possess a wisdom that went beyond her years."

The very first thing which she had noticed in her life was—what?—not the mother’s smile, responding to it, as other babies do, by that faint, embryo smile of the little mouth, remembered so doubtfully afterwards, and with such fond discussion whether it were indeed a smile. By no means! But that first object of which Pearl seemed to become aware was—shall we say it?—the scarlet letter on Hester’s bosom! One day, as her mother stooped over the cradle, the infant’s eyes had been caught by the glimmering of the gold embroidery about the letter; and, putting up her little hand, she grasped at it, smiling, not doubtfully, but with a decided gleam, that gave her face the look of a much older child. Then, gasping for breath, did Hester Prynne clutch the fatal token, instinctively endeavoring to tear it away; so infinite was the torture inflicted by the intelligent touch of Pearl’s baby-hand. Again, as if her mother’s agonized gesture were meant only to make sport for her, did little Pearl look into her eyes, and smile! From that epoch, except when the child was asleep, Hester had never felt a moment’s safety; not a moment’s calm enjoyment of her. Weeks, it is true, would sometimes elapse, during which Pearl’s gaze might never once be fixed upon the scarlet letter; but then, again, it would come at unawares, like the stroke of sudden death, and always with that peculiar smile, and odd expression of the eyes.\nOnce, this freakish, elvish cast came into the child’s eyes, while Hester was looking at her own image in them, as mothers are fond of doing; and, suddenly,—for women in solitude, and with troubled hearts, are pestered with unaccountable delusions,—she fancied that she beheld, not her own miniature portrait, but another face, in the small black mirror of Pearl’s eye. It was a face, fiend-like, full of smiling malice, yet bearing the semblance of features that she had known full well, though seldom with a smile, and never with malice in them. It was as if an evil spirit possessed the child, and had just then peeped forth in mockery. Many a time afterwards had Hester been tortured, though less vividly, by the same illusion.\nIn the afternoon of a certain summer’s day, after Pearl grew big enough to run about, she amused herself with gathering handfuls of wild-flowers, and flinging them, one by one, at her mother’s bosom; dancing up and down, like a little elf, whenever she hit the scarlet letter. Hester’s first motion had been to cover her bosom with her clasped hands. But, whether from pride or resignation, or a feeling that her penance might best be wrought out by this unutterable pain, she resisted the impulse, and sat erect, pale as death, looking sadly into little Pearl’s wild eyes. Still came the battery of flowers, almost invariably hitting the mark, and covering the mother’s breast with hurts for which she could find no balm in this world, nor knew how to seek it in another. At last, her shot being all expended, the child stood still and gazed at Hester, with that little, laughing image of a fiend peeping out—or, whether it peeped or no, her mother so imagined it—from the unsearchable abyss of her black eyes.",

Or, perhaps, she might frown, and look black as a thunder-cloud, and then, all of a sudden, break out in the most pealing laughter.  So strange was the effect of her mother’s pain, on the little ventriloquist of four years old.  One peculiarity of the child’s nature, among a multitude of touches that made her so unlike other children, was that she never seemed to have any errand of her own, but always either stood on the threshold, or had just entered, or was about to depart.  She never played alone, but always with her mother!  If Hester sometimes put together an assemblage of rags and other heterogeneous materials, calling it a doll, Pearl forthwith took the baby of rags, and put it to her cheek, and smiled, and cooed, and seemed ready to nurse it; but presently, with a frown, and a sly kind of smile, she would prick its eyes out with her little forefinger, or thrust it behind the fire, or into the brook.

It seemed as if the child could not be made amenable to rules.

She seemed rather an airy sprite, which, after playing its fantastic sports for a little while upon the cottage floor, would flit away with a mocking smile.  Whenever Hester saw that smile, she shuddered; and, no doubt, if the truth were known, the child’s smile is the most dreadful thing in a mother’s experience.

Tell me!” repeated Pearl, no longer seriously, but laughing, and capering about the floor. “It is thou that must tell me!”\nBut Hester could not resolve the query, being herself in a dismal labyrinth of doubt. She remembered—betwixt a smile and a shudder—the talk of the neighboring towns-people; who, seeking vainly elsewhere for the child’s paternity, and observing some of her odd attributes, had given out that poor little Pearl was a demon offspring; such as, ever since old Catholic times, had occasionally been seen on earth, through the agency of their mother’s sin, and to promote some foul and wicked purpose.

It had reached her ears, that there was a design on the part of some of the leading inhabitants, cherishing the more rigid order of principles in religion and government, to deprive her of her child. On the supposition that Pearl, as already hinted, was of demon origin, these good people not unreasonably argued that a Christian interest in the mother’s soul required them to remove such a stumbling-block from her path. If the child, on the other hand, were really capable of moral and religious growth, and possessed the elements of ultimate salvation, then, surely, it would enjoy all the fairer prospect of these advantages, by being transferred to wiser and better guardianship than Hester Prynne’s. Among those who promoted the design, Governor Bellingham was said to be one of the most busy. It may appear singular, and indeed, not a little ludicrous, that an affair of this kind, which, in later days, would have been referred to no higher jurisdiction than that of the selectmen of the town, should then have been a question publicly discussed, and on which statesmen of eminence took sides. At that epoch of pristine simplicity, however, matters of even slighter public interest, and of far less intrinsic weight, than the welfare of Hester and her child, were strangely mixed up with the deliberations of legislators and acts of state. The period was hardly, if at all, earlier than that of our story, when a dispute concerning the right of property in a pig not only caused a fierce and bitter contest in the legislative body of the colony, but resulted in an important modification of the framework itself of the legislature.",

Another object, which Hester had in view, equally important with the delivery of the embroidered gloves, was to beseech the Governor to suffer Pearl to remain under her sole guardianship. The rumor was strong, that the magistrates were thinking seriously of separating Pearl from her mother. This was due, in part, to the ostensible piety of some influential citizens, who had frequently noticed Pearl’s more than ordinary vivacity and assurance, which they interpreted as of demoniac origin, and to be repressed at once by stern discipline. It was also an idea of those same wise and pious magistrates, that the child, in its lonely elevation above the common system, might develop all her eccentricities, and even verge across the line of sanity, unless restrained and regulated by salutary discipline. Furthermore, the child was of imperfect discipline already, and might become a very little demon of mischief; and that, in either case, she must be removed from the influence of the mother, who had shown herself incapable of regulating it. What was Hester Prynne, the scarlet woman, the mother of a babe that might prove a fiend, to show reverence for the holy clergyman, to teach Pearl the catechism, or to enforce it by scourging, if it were necessary? It is true, she saw little further than the infant’s smile, or frown; but as she had no religious training herself, they might be the signs of a nature that was altogether wild, untamed, and even unhumanized. The magistrates, in short, looked upon Pearl as a child of demon or angel, and to be dealt with accordingly. Hester could not but know, that there was a design on foot to deprive her of Pearl, and that these were the motives of the scheme. It was a matter of grave moment, therefore, to look the Governor in the face, and entreat his mercy. She had not known where to seek him, and had waited for this opportunity of meeting him in his own mansion. This mansion was situated on the peninsula, and was accessible only by a footpath, which wound through a wild and rocky tract of land, and was bordered by a deep and rapid stream. The house was of stone, and was built in the style of the old English manor-houses, with a high roof, and a large porch, and a number of windows, which were all of diamond shape, and were set in leaden frames. The interior of the house was in keeping with the exterior, and was furnished with massive furniture, and with a number of portraits of the Governor’s ancestors, which were all of a grave and severe aspect. The Governor himself was a man of about sixty years of age, with a grave and thoughtful countenance, and with a long white beard, which descended to his waist. He was dressed in a suit of black velvet, and wore a ruff about his neck, and a pair of gloves on his hands. He was seated in a large arm-chair, and was engaged in reading a book, which was lying open on a table before him. Hester entered the room, and made a low obeisance to the Governor, who returned her salutation with a grave inclination of his head. He then motioned her to a seat, and she sat down on a chair which was placed opposite to him. Pearl, in the meantime, had been amusing herself by examining the portraits on the walls, and by looking out of the windows. She now came forward, and stood by her mother’s side, and looked at the Governor with a mixture of curiosity and awe. The Governor looked at her with a grave and thoughtful expression, and then turned to Hester, and said, “Hester Prynne, I have sent for you, that I may inquire into the truth of the rumors which have reached me, respecting your child. It is said, that she is a child of the devil, and that she is not fit to be under your care. What have you to say in answer to this charge?” Hester’s heart sank within her, as she heard these words, but she summoned up all her courage, and answered, “Your Excellency, I have nothing to say in answer to this charge, except that it is false. My child is not a child of the devil, but is a child of God. She is a gift from Him, and I will not part with her.” The Governor looked at her with a stern and searching gaze, and then said, “Hester Prynne, you have been a great sinner, and you have brought shame upon yourself and upon this community. It is not fit that you should have the care of a child, who may be a child of God. It is better that she should be placed under the care of those who are more worthy to have charge of her.” Hester’s eyes flashed with indignation, as she heard these words, and she answered, “Your Excellency, I have been a great sinner, but I have repented of my sin, and I have borne the punishment which has been inflicted upon me. I have worn the scarlet letter for seven years, and I have endured the scorn and the contempt of the people. I have also brought up my child in the fear of God, and I have taught her to love Him. She is a good child, and she is worthy to be under my care.” The Governor was silent for a few moments, and then said, “Hester Prynne, I will consider what you have",

With her companion, Pearl, she passed through the arched gateway of the venerable house, and stood in the open air of the garden, which was cultivated with that prim orderliness characteristic of Puritan taste, yet not without a few flowers, such as the rose, the hollyhock, and the marigold, which seemed to have strayed thither from the more genial soil of England. Pearl, in her scarlet tunic, which was embroidered with gold thread in a fantastic pattern, and which she had insisted upon wearing, looked like a bright tropical bird, a creature of flame and sunshine, utterly out of place in this sober, grey environment. Her eyes, dark and sparkling, darted everywhere, taking in the unfamiliar sights with a wild, untamed curiosity.\nHester, meanwhile, felt the familiar weight of the scarlet letter upon her breast, a brand that seemed to grow hotter under the gaze of the stately mansion. She had come not merely to deliver the gloves, but with a deeper, more desperate purpose: to implore the Governor and his colleagues not to take Pearl from her. Rumors had reached her that the magistrates, influenced by the rigid clergy, were considering removing Pearl, deeming Hester an unfit mother due to her sin and the child's wild nature. This thought was a torment, a sharper agony than the public shame. Pearl was her punishment, yes, but also her sole joy, her connection to life, her strange, living symbol of the letter itself.\nAs they approached the entrance, a servant appeared, a man of grave aspect, who regarded Hester with a look that mingled recognition and disapproval. He admitted them into the hall, a spacious apartment panelled with dark wood, where suits of armor gleamed ominously in the dim light. Pearl immediately ran towards a polished breastplate, captivated by her own distorted reflection. Hester followed, her heart heavy with apprehension, preparing herself for the difficult plea she must make."

Little Pearl, of course, was her companion. She was now of an age to run lightly along by her mother’s side, and, constantly in motion, from morn till sunset, could have accomplished a much longer journey than that before her. Often, nevertheless, more from caprice than necessity, she demanded to be taken up in arms; but was soon as imperious to be set down again, and frisked onward before Hester on the grassy pathway, with many a harmless trip and tumble. We have spoken of Pearl’s rich and luxuriant beauty; a beauty that shone with deep and vivid tints; a bright complexion, eyes possessing intensity both of depth and glow, and hair already of a deep, glossy brown, and which, in after years, would be nearly akin to black. There was fire in her and throughout her; she seemed the unpremeditated offshoot of a passionate moment. Her mother, in contriving the child’s garb, had allowed the gorgeous tendencies of her imagination their full play; arraying her in a crimson velvet tunic, of a peculiar cut, abundantly embroidered with fantasies and flourishes of gold-thread. So much strength of coloring, which must have given a wan and pallid aspect to cheeks of a fainter bloom, was admirably adapted to Pearl’s beauty, and made her the very brightest little jet of flame that ever danced upon the earth.\nBut it was a remarkable attribute of this garb, and, indeed, of the child’s whole appearance, that it irresistibly and inevitably reminded the beholder of the token which Hester Prynne was doomed to wear upon her bosom. It was the scarlet letter in another form; the scarlet letter endowed with life! The mother herself—as if the red ignominy were so deeply scorched into her brain that all her conceptions assumed its form—had carefully wrought out the similitude; lavishing many hours of morbid ingenuity, to create an analogy between the object of her affection and the emblem of her guilt and torture. But, in truth, Pearl was the one, as well as the other; and only in consequence of that identity had Hester contrived so perfectly to represent the scarlet letter in her appearance.",

She beheld the children preparing to fling stones, and clay, and mud, at her and her mother. But as they approached, with a sort of hostile indifference, Pearl put up her infant hand and held forth a finger, the gesture of which had generally been found effectual, though by no means of a friendly character. The ungracious Puritans, however, were not to be daunted by the mere demonstration of a purpose. They made a rush, and Pearl, uttering a shrill, wild, and incomprehensible cry, which the onlookers mistook for childish sport, but which was really the voice of a spirit, responded to the assault by an onslaught in return. She flew at them like a mad little elf, defending herself against the whole troop of Puritans with a fierceness that put them all to flight, and Pearl, with a laughing face, pursued the fugitives a considerable distance. The little Puritans, being unaccustomed to such an assault, fled in terror, and Pearl, having driven them all before her, returned to her mother, flushed and panting, but with a look of triumph in her eyes.",

Come, therefore, and let us fling mud at them!”\n\nBut Pearl, who was a dauntless child, saw generally abundant cause of joy, and more especially in the bright sunshine of the summer morning, on which the Governor had given notice of his purpose to hold a public assemblage here. She beheld the children preparing to fling stones, and clay, and mud, at her and her mother. But as they approached, with a sort of hostile indifference, Pearl put up her infant hand and held forth a finger, the gesture of which had generally been found effectual, though by no means of a friendly character. The ungracious Puritans, however, were not to be daunted by the mere demonstration of a purpose. They made a rush, and Pearl, uttering a shrill, wild, and incomprehensible cry, which the onlookers mistook for childish sport, but which was really the voice of a spirit, responded to the assault by an onslaught in return. She flew at them like a mad little elf, defending herself against the whole troop of Puritans with a fierceness that put them all to flight, and Pearl, with a laughing face, pursued the fugitives a considerable distance. The little Puritans, being unaccustomed to such an assault, fled in terror, and Pearl, having driven them all before her, returned to her mother, flushed and panting, but with a look of triumph in her eyes.",

These children, raised in the stern discipline of Puritanism, had absorbed the lessons of shame and sin from their earliest breath. They knew Hester Prynne not as a person, but as a walking embodiment of transgression. They would sometimes gather at a safe distance, mimicking the gestures of scorn they saw in their elders, or even pelting Pearl with mud-clods, finding a strange, cruel sport in her fiery, untamed reactions. Pearl, in turn, would often turn upon them with a fierceness that startled even Hester, her eyes flashing, her small hands clenched, a miniature fury against the world that ostracized her mother and herself. They were outcasts, even among the youngest generation."

This was a large wooden house, built in a fashion of which there are specimens still extant in the streets of our older towns; now moss-grown, crumbling to decay, and melancholy at heart with the many sorrowful or joyful occurrences, remembered or forgotten, that have happened, and passed away, within their dusky chambers. Then, however, there was the freshness of the passing year on its exterior, and the cheerfulness, gleaming forth from the sunny windows, of a human habitation, into which death had never entered. It had, indeed, a very cheery aspect; the walls being overspread with a kind of stucco, in which fragments of broken glass were plentifully intermixed; so that, when the sunshine fell aslant-wise over the front of the edifice, it glittered and sparkled as if diamonds had been flung against it by the double handful. The brilliancy might have befitted Aladdin’s palace, rather than the mansion of a grave old Puritan ruler. It was further decorated with strange and seemingly cabalistic figures and diagrams, suitable to the quaint taste of the age, which had been drawn in the stucco when newly laid on, and had now grown hard and durable, for the admiration of after times.\nPearl, looking at this bright wonder of a house, began to caper and dance, and imperatively required that the whole breadth of sunshine should be stripped off its front, and given her to play with.\n“No, my little Pearl!” said her mother. “Thou must gather thine own sunshine. I have none to give thee!”\nThey approached the door; which was of an arched form, and flanked on each side by a narrow tower or projection of the edifice, in both of which were lattice-windows, with wooden shutters to close over them at need. Lifting the iron hammer that hung at the portal, Hester Prynne gave a summons, which was answered by one of the Governor’s bond-servants; a free-born Englishman, but now a seven years’ slave. During that term he was to be the property of his master, and as much a commodity of bargain and sale as an ox, or a joint-stool. The serf wore the blue coat, which was the customary garb of serving-men of that period, and long before, in the old hereditary halls of England.\n“Is the worshipful Governor Bellingham within?” inquired Hester.\n“Yea, forsooth,” replied the bond-servant, staring with wide-open eyes at the scarlet letter, which, being a new-comer in the country, he had never before seen. “Yea, his honorable worship is within. But he hath a godly minister or two with him, and likewise a leech. Ye may not see his worship now.”\n“Nevertheless, I will enter,” answered Hester Prynne, and the bond-servant, perhaps judging from the decision of her air, and the glittering symbol in her bosom, that she was a great lady in the land, offered no opposition.\nSo the mother and little Pearl were admitted into the hall of entrance.",

          "text_segment": "With many variations, suggested by the nature of his building-materials, diversity of climate, and a different mode of social life, Governor Bellingham had planned his new habitation after the residences of gentlemen of fair estate in his native land. Here, then, was a wide and reasonably lofty hall, extending through the whole depth of the house, and forming a medium of general communication, more or less directly, with all the other apartments. At one extremity, this spacious room was lighted by the windows of the two towers, which formed a small recess on either side of the portal. At the other end, though partly muffled by a curtain, it was more powerfully illuminated by one of those embowed hall-windows which we read of in old books, and which was provided with a deep and cushioned seat. Here, on the cushion, lay a folio tome, probably of the Chronicles of England, or other such substantial literature; even as, in our own days, we scatter gilded volumes on the centre-table, to be turned over by the casual guest. The furniture of the hall consisted of some ponderous chairs, the backs of which were elaborately carved with wreaths of oaken flowers; and likewise a table in the same taste; the whole being of the Elizabethan age, or perhaps earlier, and heirlooms, transferred hither from the Governor’s paternal home. On the table—in token that the sentiment of old English hospitality had not been left behind—stood a large pewter tankard, at the bottom of which, had Hester or Pearl peeped into it, they might have seen the frothy remnant of a recent draught of ale.\nOn the wall hung a row of portraits, representing the forefathers of the Bellingham lineage, some with armor on their breasts, and others with stately ruffs and robes of peace. All were characterized by the sternness and severity which old portraits so invariably put on; as if they were the ghosts, rather than the pictures, of departed worthies, and were gazing with harsh and intolerant criticism at the pursuits and enjoyments of living men.\nAt about the centre of the oaken panels, that lined the hall, was suspended a suit of mail, not, like the pictures, an ancestral relic, but of the most modern date; for it had been manufactured by a skilful armorer in London, the same year in which Governor Bellingham came over to New England. There was a steel head-piece, a cuirass, a gorget, and greaves, with a pair of gauntlets and a sword hanging beneath; all, and especially the helmet and breastplate, so highly burnished as to glow with white radiance, and scatter an illumination everywhere about upon the floor. This bright panoply was not meant for mere idle show, but had been worn by the Governor on many a solemn muster and training field, and had glittered, moreover, at the head of a regiment in the Pequod war. For, though bred a lawyer, and accustomed to speak of Bacon, Coke, Noye, and Finch as his professional associates, the exigencies of this new country had transformed Governor Bellingham into a soldier, as well as a statesman and ruler.\nLittle Pearl—who was as greatly pleased with the gleaming armor as she had been with the glittering frontispiece of the house—spent some time looking into the polished mirror of the breastplate.\n“Mother,” cried she, “I see you here. Look! Look!”\nHester looked, by way of humoring the child; and she saw that, owing to the peculiar effect of this convex mirror, the scarlet letter was represented in exaggerated and gigantic proportions, so as to be greatly the most prominent feature of her appearance. In truth, she seemed absolutely hidden behind it. Pearl pointed upward, also, at a similar picture in the head-piece; smiling at her mother, with the elfish intelligence that was so familiar an expression on her small physiognomy. That look of naughty merriment was likewise reflected in the mirror, with so much breadth and intensity of effect, that it made Hester Prynne feel as if it could not be the image of her own child, but of an imp who was seeking to mould itself into Pearl’s shape.",

They were, all, sad-visaged, sallow-complexioned, bulky personages, dimly seen through any mists that might have gathered on the surface of the canvass, gaining little light, and casting none upon the beholder. The most prominent object was a suit of mail, not, however, what is called complete armor, but a breastplate and helmet, long ago worn by the Governor in the Pequod war. It was burnished, and kept bright at the Governor’s order, lest the rust of the climate should creep unawares upon it.

It may be we shall see flowers there; more beautiful ones than we find in the woods.”\nPearl, accordingly, ran to the bow-window, at the farther end of the hall, and looked along the vista of a garden-walk, carpeted with closely shaven grass, and bordered with some rude and immature attempt at shrubbery. But the proprietor appeared already to have relinquished, as hopeless, the effort to perpetuate on this side of the Atlantic, in a hard soil and amid the close struggle for subsistence, the native English taste for ornamental gardening. Cabbages grew in plain sight; and a pumpkin-vine, rooted at some distance, had run across the intervening space, and deposited one of its gigantic products directly beneath the hall-window; as if to warn the Governor that this great lump of vegetable gold was as rich an ornament as New England earth would offer him. There were a few rose-bushes, however, and a number of apple-trees, probably the descendants of those planted by the Reverend Mr. Blackstone, the first settler of the peninsula; that half-mythological personage, who rides through our early annals, seated on the back of a bull.\nPearl, seeing the rose-bushes, began to cry for a red rose, and would not be pacified.\n“Hush, child, hush!” said her mother, earnestly. “Do not cry, dear little Pearl! I hear voices in the garden. The Governor is coming, and gentlemen along with him!”\nIn fact, adown the vista of the garden avenue a number of persons were seen approaching towards the house. Pearl, in utter scorn of her mother’s attempt to quiet her, gave an eldritch scream, and then became silent; not from any notion of obedience, but because the quick and mobile curiosity of her disposition was excited by the appearance of these new personages.",

The wide circumference of an elaborate ruff, beneath his gray beard, in the antiquated fashion of King James’s reign, caused his head to look not a little like that of John the Baptist in a charger. The impression made by his aspect, so rigid and severe, and frost-bitten with more than autumnal age, was hardly in keeping with the appliances of worldly enjoyment wherewith he had evidently done his utmost to surround himself. But it is an error to suppose that our grave forefathers—though accustomed to speak and think of human existence as a state merely of trial and warfare, and though unfeignedly prepared to sacrifice goods and life at the behest of duty—made it a matter of conscience to reject such means of comfort, or even luxury, as lay fairly within their grasp. This creed was never taught, for instance, by the venerable pastor, John Wilson, whose beard, white as a snow-drift, was seen over Governor Bellingham’s shoulder; while its wearer suggested that pears and peaches might yet be naturalized in the New England climate, and that purple grapes might possibly be compelled to nourish, against the sunny garden-wall. The old clergyman, nurtured at the rich bosom of the English Church, had a long-established and legitimate taste for all good and comfortable things; and however stern he might show himself in the pulpit, or in his public reproof of such transgressions as that of Hester Prynne, still the genial benevolence of his private life had won him warmer affection than was accorded to any of his professional contemporaries.\nBehind the Governor and Mr. Wilson came two other guests: one the Reverend Arthur Dimmesdale, whom the reader may remember as having taken a brief and reluctant part in the scene of Hester Prynne’s disgrace; and, in close companionship with him, old Roger Chillingworth, a person of great skill in physic, who, for two or three years past, had been settled in the town. It was understood that this learned man was the physician as well as friend of the young minister, whose health had severely suffered, of late, by his too unreserved self-sacrifice to the labors and duties of the pastoral relation.\nThe Governor, in advance of his visitors, ascended one or two steps, and, throwing open the leaves of the great hall-window, found himself close to little Pearl. The shadow of the curtain fell on Hester Prynne, and partially concealed her.\n“What have we here?” said Governor Bellingham, looking with surprise at the scarlet little figure before him. “I profess, I have never seen the like, since my days of vanity, in old King James’s time, when I was wont to esteem it a high favor to be admitted to a court mask! There used to be a swarm of these small apparitions, in holiday time; and we called them children of the Lord of Misrule. But how gat such a guest into my hall?”\n“Ay, indeed!” cried good old Mr. Wilson. “What little bird of scarlet plumage may this be? Methinks I have seen just such figures, when the sun has been shining through a richly painted window, and tracing out the golden and crimson images across the floor. But that was in the old land. Prithee, young one, who art thou, and what has ailed thy mother to bedizen thee in this strange fashion? Art thou a Christian child,—ha? Dost know thy catechism? Or art thou one of those naughty elfs or fairies, whom we thought to have left behind us, with other relics of Papistry, in merry old England?”\n“I am mother’s child,” answered the scarlet vision, “and my name is Pearl!”\n“Pearl?—Ruby, rather!—or Coral!—or Red Rose, at the very least, judging from thy hue!” responded the old minister, putting forth his hand in a vain attempt to pat little Pearl on the cheek. “But where is this mother of thine? Ah! I see,” he added; and, turning to Governor Bellingham, whispered, “This is the selfsame child of whom we have held speech together; and behold here the unhappy woman, Hester Prynne, her mother!”\n“Sayest thou so?” cried the Governor. “Nay, we might have judged that such a child’s mother must needs be a scarlet woman, and a worthy type of her of Babylon! But she comes at a good time; and we will look into this matter forthwith.”",

On the other side of the pathway, and in earnest conversation with him, was Mr. Wilson, the venerable clergyman of Boston, holding his hand across his body, and a staff in the other. His aspect was kindly, but not so genial as to be free from a slight admixture of sternness, which hardly accorded with his ruddy cheek and comfortable figure. The third member of the party was Mr. Dimmesdale, a young clergyman, who had come from one of the great English universities, bringing all the learning of the age into our wild forest-land. His form was thin and fragile, and his cheek pale; but there was a light in his dark eyes, and a sweetness in his melancholy smile, which, had there been nothing else to indicate it, would have betokened him a man of keen intellect, suffering from a morbid sensitiveness of nerve. The fourth person in the group, and one who attracted the most observation, by the strangeness of his aspect, was the physician, Roger Chillingworth. As he stood in the sunshine, his face was dark and furrowed, and a smile of singular meaning was in his eyes. He was a man of science, and a deep observer, but there was a chillness in his look, and a strange, unearthly intelligence, which made men shudder. These four gentlemen were now in the garden of the Governor's house, a spacious and well-cultivated spot, where the Governor took much delight in his flowers and fruits. The house itself was a large wooden edifice, built in the style of the time, with a steep roof and projecting stories. It was not a magnificent structure, but it had an air of solid comfort and respectability. As the gentlemen walked along the pathway, they came to a sudden halt, for they perceived a figure standing before the entrance of the house. It was Hester Prynne, with her child Pearl. Hester was dressed in her usual coarse gray garment, but the scarlet letter on her breast gleamed with a fierce and terrible radiance. Pearl was arrayed in a dress of crimson velvet, embroidered with gold thread, which Hester had made for her. The child's beauty was remarkable, but there was a wildness in her eyes, and a strange, elfish grace in her movements, which made her seem like a creature from another world. The gentlemen paused, and looked at Hester and Pearl with surprise. Governor Bellingham, recovering himself, addressed Hester in a stern voice. \"Hester Prynne,\" said he, \"what brings you to my door?\" Hester, with a firm step, advanced towards the gentlemen. \"I have come,\" she said, \"to deliver the gloves which I have embroidered for your worship. And I have come also to speak concerning my child, Pearl.\" Mr. Wilson, stepping forward, looked at Pearl with a critical eye. \"The child is strangely arrayed,\" said he. \"It is not meet that a child of Christian parents should be clothed in such gaudy attire.\" \"She is my child,\" said Hester, with a flash of pride in her eyes. \"And I have a right to dress her as I see fit.\" Governor Bellingham frowned. \"That is not the matter at hand,\" said he. \"We have been informed, Hester Prynne, that you are not a fit mother for this child. Your life has been a scandal to the community, and it is feared that you will bring up the child in the ways of sin.\" \"I have sinned,\" said Hester, her voice low but clear. \"But I have repented. And I have striven to bring up my child in the fear of God.\" Mr. Wilson shook his head. \"The child is a wild one,\" said he. \"She needs a stricter hand than yours. She needs to be taught the catechism, and to be brought up in the ways of righteousness.\" He turned to Pearl. \"Child,\" said he, \"canst thou tell me who made thee?\" Pearl, instead of answering, pointed her finger at the scarlet letter on her mother's breast. The gentlemen looked at each other in dismay. \"She is a demon child,\" muttered one of them."

Were it not, thinkest thou, for thy little one’s temporal and eternal welfare that she be taken out of thy charge, and clad soberly, and disciplined strictly, and instructed in the truths of heaven and earth? What canst thou do for the child, in this kind?”\n“I can teach my little Pearl what I have learned from this!” answered Hester Prynne, laying her finger on the red token.\n“Woman, it is thy badge of shame!” replied the stern magistrate. “It is because of the stain which that letter indicates, that we would transfer thy child to other hands.”\n“Nevertheless,” said the mother, calmly, though growing more pale, “this badge hath taught me—it daily teaches me—it is teaching me at this moment—lessons whereof my child may be the wiser and better, albeit they can profit nothing to myself.”\n“We will judge warily,” said Bellingham, “and look well what we are about to do. Good Master Wilson, I pray you, examine this Pearl,—since that is her name,—and see whether she hath had such Christian nurture as befits a child of her age.”\nThe old minister seated himself in an arm-chair, and made an effort to draw Pearl betwixt his knees. But the child, unaccustomed to the touch or familiarity of any but her mother, escaped through the open window, and stood on the upper step, looking like a wild tropical bird, of rich plumage, ready to take flight into the upper air. Mr. Wilson, not a little astonished at this outbreak,—for he was a grandfatherly sort of personage, and usually a vast favorite with children,—essayed, however, to proceed with the examination.\n“Pearl,” said he, with great solemnity, “thou must take heed to instruction, that so, in due season, thou mayest wear in thy bosom the pearl of great price. Canst thou tell me, my child, who made thee?”\nNow Pearl knew well enough who made her; for Hester Prynne, the daughter of a pious home, very soon after her talk with the child about her Heavenly Father, had begun to inform her of those truths which the human spirit, at whatever stage of immaturity, imbibes with such eager interest. Pearl, therefore, so large were the attainments of her three years’ lifetime, could have borne a fair examination in the New England Primer, or the first column of the Westminster Catechisms, although unacquainted with the outward form of either of those celebrated works. But that perversity which all children have more or less of, and of which little Pearl had a tenfold portion, now, at the most inopportune moment, took thorough possession of her, and closed her lips, or impelled her to speak words amiss. After putting her finger in her mouth, with many ungracious refusals to answer good Mr. Wilson’s question, the child finally announced that she had not been made at all, but had been plucked by her mother off the bush of wild roses that grew by the prison-door.\nThis fantasy was probably suggested by the near proximity of the Governor’s red roses, as Pearl stood outside of the window; together with her recollection of the prison rose-bush, which she had passed in coming hither.",

She met his eyes for an instant, but was immediately constrained to give all her attention to the scene now going forward.\n“This is awful!” cried the Governor, slowly recovering from the astonishment into which Pearl’s response had thrown him. “Here is a child of three years old, and she cannot tell who made her! Without question, she is equally in the dark as to her soul, its present depravity, and future destiny!

She is my happiness!—she is my torture, none the less! Pearl keeps me here in life! Pearl punishes me too!

It was a suggestion, couched in the language of medical inquiry, yet carrying a subtle, venomous sting that went straight to the core of Arthur Dimmesdale’s hidden agony. The minister started, a faint tremor passing through his frame, and his hand instinctively went to his breast, a gesture that had become habitual in his moments of distress. His already pale face grew a shade whiter, and his eyes, usually so full of a spiritual light that captivated his congregation, now held a look of profound disquiet, bordering on terror.\n\nChillingworth’s smile did not fade; it merely deepened, becoming less a sign of amusement and more a mask for the cold, calculating intelligence that lay beneath. He watched Dimmesdale with an intensity that was both clinical and predatory, like a physician observing a fascinating, terminal disease, or a hunter cornering his prey. He had, over the past months, woven himself inextricably into the minister’s life, ostensibly as a physician dedicated to curing his mysterious ailment, but in truth, as a torturer meticulously dissecting a soul.\n\n“Does the good minister find my observation amiss?” Chillingworth inquired softly, his voice smooth as oil, yet with an undertone that suggested he already knew the answer. “It is merely a thought that occurred to me, regarding the peculiar connection between the maladies of the spirit and the afflictions of the flesh. Sometimes, a hidden grief, a secret sorrow, can manifest itself in the most unexpected physical symptoms. Does not the Scripture itself speak of the body being a temple, and how its defilement can lead to decay?”\n\nDimmesdale swallowed hard, his gaze flickering away from the old man’s piercing eyes. He felt trapped, exposed, as if Chillingworth’s words were not merely questions but accusations, aimed directly at the festering wound in his conscience. He longed to cry out, to confess, to tear off the mask of sanctity and reveal the sin-stricken wretch beneath. But the weight of his reputation, the adoration of his flock, and the sheer, paralyzing fear of public shame held him captive.\n\n“Your… your medical insights are valuable, Master Chillingworth,” Dimmesdale managed to stammer, his voice weak and strained. “But the soul’s burdens are known only to God and the man who bears them. It is not a subject for earthly physicians.”\n\nChillingworth nodded slowly, his smile unwavering. “Indeed,” he murmured. “But sometimes, the physician of the body can offer solace, or at least understanding, to the physician of the soul. We are both seekers of truth, are we not? Though our paths may differ.” He paused, letting the silence hang heavy between them, a silence filled with unspoken knowledge and simmering dread. Dimmesdale knew, with a chilling certainty, that Chillingworth was not merely a physician; he was something far more sinister, a presence that fed upon his suffering, a living embodiment of his own unexpiated guilt."

          "text_segment": "At this wild and singular appeal, which indicated that Hester Prynne’s situation had provoked her to little less than madness, the young minister at once came forward, pale, and holding his hand over his heart, as was his custom whenever his peculiarly nervous temperament was thrown into agitation. He looked now more care-worn and emaciated than as we described him at the scene of Hester’s public ignominy; and whether it were his failing health, or whatever the cause might be, his large dark eyes had a world of pain in their troubled and melancholy depth.\n“There is truth in what she says,” began the minister, with a voice sweet, tremulous, but powerful, insomuch that the hall re-echoed, and the hollow armor rang with it,—“truth in what Hester says, and in the feeling which inspires her! God gave her the child, and gave her, too, an instinctive knowledge of its nature and requirements,—both seemingly so peculiar,—which no other mortal being can possess. And, moreover, is there not a quality of awful sacredness in the relation between this mother and this child?”\n“Ay!—how is that, good Master Dimmesdale?” interrupted the Governor. “Make that plain, I pray you!”\n“It must be even so,” resumed the minister. “For, if we deem it otherwise, do we not thereby say that the Heavenly Father, the Creator of all flesh, hath lightly recognized a deed of sin, and made of no account the distinction between unhallowed lust and holy love? This child of its father’s guilt and its mother’s shame hath come from the hand of God, to work in many ways upon her heart, who pleads so earnestly, and with such bitterness of spirit, the right to keep her. It was meant for a blessing; for the one blessing of her life! It was meant, doubtless, as the mother herself hath told us, for a retribution too; a torture to be felt at many an unthought-of moment; a pang, a sting, an ever-recurring agony, in the midst of a troubled joy! Hath she not expressed this thought in the garb of the poor child, so forcibly reminding us of that red symbol which sears her bosom?”\n“Well said, again!” cried good Mr. Wilson. “I feared the woman had no better thought than to make a mountebank of her child!”\n“O, not so!—not so!” continued Mr. Dimmesdale. “She recognizes, believe me, the solemn miracle which God hath wrought, in the existence of that child. And may she feel, too,—what, methinks, is the very truth,—that this boon was meant, above all things else, to keep the mother’s soul alive, and to preserve her from blacker depths of sin into which Satan might else have sought to plunge her! Therefore it is good for this poor, sinful woman that she hath an infant immortality, a being capable of eternal joy or sorrow, confided to her care,—to be trained up by her to righteousness,—to remind her, at every moment, of her fall,—but yet to teach her, as it were by the Creator’s sacred pledge, that, if she bring the child to heaven, the child also will bring its parent thither! Herein is the sinful mother happier than the sinful father. For Hester Prynne’s sake, then, and no less for the poor child’s sake, let us leave them as Providence hath seen fit to place them!”",

He looked now at old Roger Chillingworth, with whom he seemed to have grown so intimate during these past few months, and now at Hester Prynne, and now at the venerable Governor Bellingham. The voice which he uttered was sweet, tremulous, yet deep and impressive, and found its way into the most secret recesses of the listeners’ souls. “There is truth in what she says,” began the minister, with many tremulous pauses, betwixt sentences. “There is truth in what Hester says, and in the sentiment which she expresses. Heaven hath granted her an unearthly insight, as the reward of her earthly punishment. She hath sinned; she hath suffered; she hath much to suffer still. But she said the truth, and she did no wrong. Else, wherefore should she not have long ago thrown off this child, long ago abandoned the scarlet letter, and betaken herself to some land where all remembrance of them might have died? She hath not done so, for reasons of divine Providence, and not of her own strength. She hath kept the living pledge thereof. She hath borne it in her arms, and on her bosom. She hath kept it all, and brought it all to shame and contumely. Softened with the gentle grace of a mother’s love, that harsh penalty, it is probable, was never felt so keenly as it was by Hester Prynne, when she had no bosom to fling the child upon, except her own desolate one. God gave her the child, and gave her, too, an instinctive knowledge of its nature and requirements. So being moved by the same hand that made her perfectly capable of discriminating betwixt good and evil, she hath felt ever since the birth of the child, a wild, untrained, left-hand mode of education, best adapted to lead Pearl, as the child of her sin, to the knowledge of a better and purer life.” “What is this that the minister says?” asked Governor Bellingham. “Is it not an argument that has been twisted to suit the occasion? He pleads for the guilty mother, and for the sinful child. Come, Mr. Wilson, and hear what this young man has to say. It is a strange doctrine, and not such as we expected to hear from your lips.” The Reverend Mr. Wilson, who had stood apart, listening with a grave and solemn aspect, now came forward, and stood beside the minister. “I have heard,” said he, “and I approve.

Hath he not pleaded well for the poor woman?”\n“Indeed hath he,” answered the magistrate, “and hath adduced such arguments, that we will even leave the matter as it now stands; so long, at least, as there shall be no further scandal in the woman. Care must be had, nevertheless, to put the child to due and stated examination in the catechism, at thy hands or Master Dimmesdale’s. Moreover, at a proper season, the tithing-men must take heed that she go both to school and to meeting.”\nThe young minister, on ceasing to speak, had withdrawn a few steps from the group, and stood with his face partially concealed in the heavy folds of the window-curtain; while the shadow of his figure, which the sunlight cast upon the floor, was tremulous with the vehemence of his appeal. Pearl, that wild and flighty little elf, stole softly towards him, and taking his hand in the grasp of both her own, laid her cheek against it; a caress so tender, and withal so unobtrusive, that her mother, who was looking on, asked herself,—“Is that my Pearl?” Yet she knew that there was love in the child’s heart, although it mostly revealed itself in passion, and hardly twice in her lifetime had been softened by such gentleness as now. The minister,—for, save the long-sought regards of woman, nothing is sweeter than these marks of childish preference, accorded spontaneously by a spiritual instinct, and therefore seeming to imply in us something truly worthy to be loved,—the minister looked round, laid his hand on the child’s head, hesitated an instant, and then kissed her brow. Little Pearl’s unwonted mood of sentiment lasted no longer; she laughed, and went capering down the hall, so airily, that old Mr. Wilson raised a question whether even her tiptoes touched the floor.\n“The little baggage hath witchcraft in her, I profess,” said he to Mr. Dimmesdale. “She needs no old woman’s broomstick to fly withal!”",

It has been related, how, in the crowd that witnessed Hester Prynne’s ignominious exposure, stood a man, elderly, travel-worn, who, just emerging from the perilous wilderness, beheld the woman, in whom he hoped to find embodied the warmth and cheerfulness of home, set up as a type of sin before the people. Her matronly fame was trodden under all men’s feet. Infamy was babbling around her in the public market-place. For her kindred, should the tidings ever reach them, and for the companions of her unspotted life, there remained nothing but the contagion of her dishonor; which would not fail to be distributed in strict accordance and proportion with the intimacy and sacredness of their previous relationship. Then why—since the choice was with himself—should the individual, whose connection with the fallen woman had been the most intimate and sacred of them all, come forward to vindicate his claim to an inheritance so little desirable? He resolved not to be pilloried beside her on her pedestal of shame. Unknown to all but Hester Prynne, and possessing the lock and key of her silence, he chose to withdraw his name from the roll of mankind, and, as regarded his former ties and interests, to vanish out of life as completely as if he indeed lay at the bottom of the ocean, whither rumor had long ago consigned him. This purpose once effected, new interests would immediately spring up, and likewise a new purpose; dark, it is true, if not guilty, but of force enough to engage the full strength of his faculties.",

This was the name of the man who had been Hester Prynne's husband, a scholar and physician, now returned from years of captivity among the Indians, his form altered, his spirit embittered. He had come back to find his wife publicly shamed, bearing the scarlet letter and a child not his own. His initial purpose, veiled beneath a calm exterior, was to discover the partner of her guilt. Having sworn Hester to secrecy regarding his true identity, he was free to pursue his quest under this new guise, a name that carried no history in the Puritan settlement, allowing him to move unsuspected among the people. His face, once perhaps benign in its scholarly aspect, had grown dark and forbidding, marked by a subtle malevolence that seemed to feed upon some hidden source of poison within his soul. His eyes, keen and penetrating, now held a cold, calculating light, ever searching, ever probing. He attached himself to the Reverend Mr. Dimmesdale, whose failing health and evident spiritual agony seemed to draw the physician's peculiar interest. Chillingworth, with the cunning of a serpent, began to insinuate himself into the minister's life, offering his medical skill and companionship. But his true aim was not healing; it was dissection. He sought to lay bare the secret that was consuming Dimmesdale, to uncover the hidden sin that mirrored Hester's public shame. He became the minister's closest confidant, yet his presence was less that of a friend and healer than of a leech, fastening upon the suffering soul and drawing sustenance from its torment. His knowledge, once used for the benefit of mankind, was now perverted into an instrument of psychological torture, wielded with chilling precision against the man he suspected of being Hester's fellow-sinner."

Skilful men, of the medical and chirurgical profession, were of rare occurrence in the colony. They seldom, it would appear, partook of the religious zeal that brought other emigrants across the Atlantic. In their researches into the human frame, it may be that the higher and more subtile faculties of such men were materialized, and that they lost the spiritual view of existence amid the intricacies of that wondrous mechanism, which seemed to involve art enough to comprise all of life within itself. At all events, the health of the good town of Boston, so far as medicine had aught to do with it, had hitherto lain in the guardianship of an aged deacon and apothecary, whose piety and godly deportment were stronger testimonials in his favor than any that he could have produced in the shape of a diploma. The only surgeon was one who combined the occasional exercise of that noble art with the daily and habitual flourish of a razor. To such a professional body Roger Chillingworth was a brilliant acquisition. He soon manifested his familiarity with the ponderous and imposing machinery of antique physic; in which every remedy contained a multitude of far-fetched and heterogeneous ingredients, as elaborately compounded as if the proposed result had been the Elixir of Life.

As his studies, privately pursued, but of a most elaborate and profound character, had so early in life made him acquainted with a knowledge of the medicinal virtues of plants and roots, he was now enabled to practice as a physician, and not so much by rightful title as by the urgent necessity of the case, and the prevalent ignorance of the time, he was readily admitted into the circle of Boston's medical advisors. It is a curious fact, and worth observation, that the physicians of the old world, especially those who had been bred at the universities, were little inclined to emigrate to the wilder shores of the New World. They were, perhaps, less motivated by the religious enthusiasm which was the mainspring of the Puritan settlement, or perhaps their habitual study of the physical body had led them to a more materialistic view of the universe, diminishing their spiritual perspective. Prior to his arrival, the medical needs of the colony were primarily managed by an aged deacon, who also served as an apothecary, valued more for his piety than his medical qualifications, and a surgeon who also practiced barbering. Roger Chillingworth was thus a significant addition to this limited professional circle. He quickly demonstrated his expertise in traditional European medicine, with its complex, multi-ingredient remedies. Furthermore, his time as a captive among Native Americans had equipped him with substantial knowledge of indigenous herbs and roots, remedies he openly valued as much as established European treatments.\n\"\"\"\n\nprint(generated_text_segment)\n```",

About this period, however, the health of Mr. Dimmesdale had evidently begun to fail. By those best acquainted with his habits, the paleness of the young minister’s cheek was accounted for by his too earnest devotion to study, his scrupulous fulfilment of parochial duty, and, more than all, by the fasts and vigils of which he made a frequent practice, in order to keep the grossness of this earthly state from clogging and obscuring his spiritual lamp. Some declared, that, if Mr. Dimmesdale were really going to die, it was cause enough, that the world was not worthy to be any longer trodden by his feet. He himself, on the other hand, with characteristic humility, avowed his belief, that, if Providence should see fit to remove him, it would be because of his own unworthiness to perform its humblest mission here on earth. With all this difference of opinion as to the cause of his decline, there could be no question of the fact. His form grew emaciated; his voice, though still rich and sweet, had a certain melancholy prophecy of decay in it; he was often observed, on any slight alarm or other sudden accident, to put his hand over his heart, with first a flush and then a paleness, indicative of pain.",

These questions were solemnly propounded to Mr. Dimmesdale by the elder ministers of Boston and the deacons of his church, who, to use their own phrase, “dealt with him” on the sin of rejecting the aid which Providence so manifestly held out. He listened in silence, and finally promised to confer with the physician.\n“Were it God’s will,” said the Reverend Mr. Dimmesdale, when, in fulfilment of this pledge, he requested old Roger Chillingworth’s professional advice, “I could be well content, that my labors, and my sorrows, and my sins, and my pains, should shortly end with me, and what is earthly of them be buried in my grave, and the spiritual go with me to my eternal state, rather than that you should put your skill to the proof in my behalf.”\n“Ah,” replied Roger Chillingworth, with that quietness which, whether imposed or natural, marked all his deportment, “it is thus that a young clergyman is apt to speak. Youthful men, not having taken a deep root, give up their hold of life so easily! And saintly men, who walk with God on earth, would fain be away, to walk with him on the golden pavements of the New Jerusalem.”\n“Nay,” rejoined the young minister, putting his hand to his heart, with a flush of pain flitting over his brow, “were I worthier to walk there, I could be better content to toil here.”\n“Good men ever interpret themselves too meanly,” said the physician.",

                "text": "This idea was countenanced by the strong interest which the physician ever manifested in the young clergyman; he attached himself to him as a parishioner, and sought to win a friendly regard and confidence from his naturally reserved sensibility. He expressed great alarm at his pastor’s state of health, but was confident that, with proper measures, by a course of active and energetic remedies, the little poor remnant of his life might be renovated, and his intellectual endowments preserved unimpaired. This hopeful assurance was much dwelt upon, and reiterated, by the elder ministers, and deacons, and worthy women of Mr. Dimmesdale’s church, who, entirely regardless of the clergyman’s own view of the matter, conceived that the physician had been sent by Providence, to heal the bodily infirmity into which the minister had fallen. Accordingly, they urged upon Mr. Dimmesdale, with great earnestness, that he would forthwith avail himself of the physician’s advice. To this, Mr. Dimmesdale, not less than his parishioners, seemed inclined to impute an awful sacredness, insomuch that he considered it a sin to reject the aid which Providence so manifestly offered. Yet, strange to say, though they thus urged the minister, the good people did not invariably recognise the same hand of Providence in Mr. Chillingworth’s appearance and proceedings. There were individuals who looked doubtfully upon the physician, and were inclined to nod their heads and whisper to one another, that all was not well. They could not readily comprehend what especial interest belonged to this man, to make him constantly hover about the clergyman with such watchful assiduity. But the clergyman, if he were not himself inclined to receive full faith in his physician, was at least strongly urged thereto by the elders and deacons of his church, and by the flock generally. Mr. Dimmesdale, however, still resisted the idea of medical aid, a little while longer. He was not, he said, acquainted with any disease of the body, but only with a sore trouble of the spirit. This, however, did not satisfy the elders and deacons. They knew that his health was failing, and failing rapidly. His cheek was pale, his form emaciated, his voice tremulous and low, and, ere long, it had become a constant habit with him, to hold his hand over his heart. They therefore again urged him to accept the aid of Mr. Chillingworth, as a physician. At length, Mr. Dimmesdale yielded. “I have thought about it, long and deeply,” said he. “I am not sure that I do well to withhold myself from a physician of such eminence as Mr. Chillingworth. The elders and deacons of the church, not to speak of the members generally, have strongly advised me to hold some conference with him. I have consented to do so.” Accordingly, the physician and the clergyman met. “I would fain have been spared this interview,” observed Mr. Dimmesdale. “I have no need of a physician. My bodily frame, it is true, is weak, and I am a burden to myself, and to the world. But I am not ill. I have no disease. I have only a sore trouble of the spirit.” “There are diseases of the spirit, as well as of the body,” answered Mr. Chillingworth. “The former are far more terrible to bear, and far more difficult to cure. I would fain hope that you have not such a disease.” “I have no disease,” repeated Mr. Dimmesdale; “no disease, but only a sore trouble of the spirit. I would fain have it end with my death.” “You are a young man,” said Mr. Chillingworth, with a calm smile. “You have many years before you. It were a pity that you should die so soon.” “I am not sure that I have many years before me,” answered Mr. Dimmesdale. “I am not sure that I have any years before me. I am not sure that I have any life before me. I am not sure that I have any being before me. I am not sure that I have any existence before me. I am not sure that I have any consciousness before me. I am not sure that I have any thought before me. I am not sure that I have any feeling before me. I am not sure that",

          "text_segment": "In this manner, the mysterious old Roger Chillingworth became the medical adviser of the Reverend Mr. Dimmesdale. As not only the disease interested the physician, but he was strongly moved to look into the character and qualities of the patient, these two men, so different in age, came gradually to spend much time together. For the sake of the minister’s health, and to enable the leech to gather plants with healing balm in them, they took long walks on the sea-shore, or in the forest; mingling various talk with the plash and murmur of the waves, and the solemn wind-anthem among the tree-tops. Often, likewise, one was the guest of the other, in his place of study and retirement. There was a fascination for the minister in the company of the man of science, in whom he recognized an intellectual cultivation of no moderate depth or scope; together with a range and freedom of ideas, that he would have vainly looked for among the members of his own profession. In truth, he was startled, if not shocked, to find this attribute in the physician. Mr. Dimmesdale was a true priest, a true religionist, with the reverential sentiment largely developed, and an order of mind that impelled itself powerfully along the track of a creed, and wore its passage continually deeper with the lapse of time. In no state of society would he have been what is called a man of liberal views; it would always be essential to his peace to feel the pressure of a faith about him, supporting, while it confined him within its iron framework. Not the less, however, though with a tremulous enjoyment, did he feel the occasional relief of looking at the universe through the medium of another kind of intellect than those with which he habitually held converse. It was as if a window were thrown open, admitting a freer atmosphere into the close and stifled study, where his life was wasting itself away, amid lamplight, or obstructed day-beams, and the musty fragrance, be it sensual or moral, that exhales from books. But the air was too fresh and chill to be long breathed with comfort. So the minister, and the physician with him, withdrew again within the limits of what their church defined as orthodox.\nThus Roger Chillingworth scrutinized his patient carefully, both as he saw him in his ordinary life, keeping an accustomed pathway in the range of thoughts familiar to him, and as he appeared when thrown amidst other moral scenery, the novelty of which might call out something new to the surface of his character. He deemed it essential, it would seem, to know the man, before attempting to do him good. Wherever there is a heart and an intellect, the diseases of the physical frame are tinged with the peculiarities of these. In Arthur Dimmesdale, thought and imagination were so active, and sensibility so intense, that the bodily infirmity would be likely to have its groundwork there. So Roger Chillingworth—the man of skill, the kind and friendly physician—strove to go deep into his patient’s bosom, delving among his principles, prying into his recollections, and probing everything with a cautious touch, like a treasure-seeker in a dark cavern. Few secrets can escape an investigator, who has opportunity and license to undertake such a quest, and skill to follow it up. A man burdened with a secret should especially avoid the intimacy of his physician. If the latter possess native sagacity, and a nameless something more,—let us call it intuition; if he show no intrusive egotism, nor disagreeably prominent characteristics of his own; if he have the power, which must be born with him, to bring his mind into such affinity with his patient’s, that this last shall unawares have spoken what he imagines himself only to have thought; if such revelations be received without tumult, and acknowledged not so often by an uttered sympathy as by silence, an inarticulate breath, and here and there a word, to indicate that all is understood; if to these qualifications of a confidant be joined the advantages afforded by his recognized character as a physician;—then, at some inevitable moment, will the soul of the sufferer be dissolved, and flow forth in a dark, but transparent stream, bringing all its mysteries into the daylight.\nRoger Chillingworth possessed all, or most, of the attributes above enumerated. Nevertheless, time went on; a kind of intimacy, as we have said, grew up between these two cultivated minds, which had as wide a field as the whole sphere of human thought and study, to meet upon; they discussed every topic of ethics and religion, of public affairs and private character; they talked much, on both sides, of matters that seemed personal to themselves; and yet no secret, such as the physician fancied must exist there, ever stole out of the minister’s consciousness into his companion’s ear. The latter had his suspicions, indeed, that even the nature of Mr. Dimmesdale’s bodily disease had never fairly been revealed to him. It was a strange reserve!",

As not infrequently happens in this world, two men, who were strangers, and had been separately tossed hither and thither by the billows of life, were compelled to be close companions in their daily walk, and to share, not merely a dwelling, but an intimacy that was far closer than ordinary brotherhood. The young minister, whose health had evidently begun to fail, was urged by his reverend brethren, as well as by the elders and deacons of the church, to seek the aid of the physician. They looked upon Roger Chillingworth as a man of skill and science, who might, by the blessing of Heaven, prolong the precious existence of a life so important to the church and to the welfare of souls. Chillingworth, on his part, had been attracted to the minister by the reports of his saintly character and his failing health. He had, moreover, a peculiar interest in the case, which he represented as solely professional, but which was, in reality, the deep, hidden purpose of his soul. He had come to Boston with the express design of discovering the man who had wronged him, and in the person of the Reverend Mr. Dimmesdale, he found the object of his search. He did not, however, reveal his true identity or his purpose. Instead, he presented himself as a physician, a man of learning and experience, who had spent years in foreign lands, gathering knowledge of herbs and remedies. He was welcomed by the community, who saw in him a providential instrument for the preservation of their beloved minister. A house was found, where the physician and the clergyman might, as it were, be under the same roof; and with this arrangement, the daily intercourse between them began. Chillingworth, with his keen intellect and his knowledge of human nature, soon perceived that the minister's ailment was not merely physical. He saw that there was a deeper cause, a hidden sorrow, a secret agony, that was preying upon the minister's vitals. He began to probe the minister's mind, to delve into the depths of his soul, seeking to discover the source of his suffering. He did this with a subtle skill, like a miner searching for gold, or a surgeon seeking a hidden wound. He would introduce topics of conversation that seemed innocent enough, but which were designed to elicit a response from the minister, to reveal the hidden pain. He spoke of the secrets of the human heart, of the burden of guilt, of the necessity of confession. He observed the minister's reactions, his changes in color, his involuntary gestures, the tremor in his voice. He noted the minister's habit of pressing his hand over his heart, as if in pain. He saw the dark circles under his eyes, the increasing pallor of his face, the wasting away of his physical strength. He saw that the minister was suffering from a spiritual malady, a disease of the soul, which was"

There was much joy throughout the town, when this greatly desirable object was attained. It was held to be the best possible measure for the young clergyman’s welfare; unless, indeed, as often urged by such as felt authorized to do so, he had selected some one of the many blooming damsels, spiritually devoted to him, to become his devoted wife. This latter step, however, there was no present prospect that Arthur Dimmesdale would be prevailed upon to take; he rejected all suggestions of the kind, as if priestly celibacy were one of his articles of church-discipline. Doomed by his own choice, therefore, as Mr. Dimmesdale so evidently was, to eat his unsavory morsel always at another’s board, and endure the life-long chill which must be his lot who seeks to warm himself only at another’s fireside, it truly seemed that this sagacious, experienced, benevolent old physician, with his concord of paternal and reverential love for the young pastor, was the very man, of all mankind, to be constantly within reach of his voice.\nThe new abode of the two friends was with a pious widow, of good social rank, who dwelt in a house covering pretty nearly the site on which the venerable structure of King’s Chapel has since been built. It had the graveyard, originally Isaac Johnson’s home-field, on one side, and so was well adapted to call up serious reflections, suited to their respective employments, in both minister and man of physic. The motherly care of the good widow assigned to Mr. Dimmesdale a front apartment, with a sunny exposure, and heavy window-curtains, to create a noontide shadow, when desirable. The walls were hung round with tapestry, said to be from the Gobelin looms, and, at all events, representing the Scriptural story of David and Bathsheba, and Nathan the Prophet, in colors still unfaded, but which made the fair woman of the scene almost as grimly picturesque as the woe-denouncing seer. Here the pale clergyman piled up his library, rich with parchment-bound folios of the Fathers, and the lore of Rabbis, and monkish erudition, of which the Protestant divines, even while they vilified and decried that class of writers, were yet constrained often to avail themselves. On the other side of the house old Roger Chillingworth arranged his study and laboratory; not such as a modern man of science would reckon even tolerably complete, but provided with a distilling apparatus, and the means of compounding drugs and chemicals, which the practised alchemist knew well how to turn to purpose. With such commodiousness of situation, these two learned persons sat themselves down, each in his own domain, yet familiarly passing from one apartment to the other, and bestowing a mutual and not incurious inspection into one another’s business.",

This measure was not altogether displeasing to the clergyman, who realized that if his bodily ailment were really of a spiritual origin, only the more intimate knowledge of his nature, gained by close converse and observation, could enable the physician to understand or relieve him. On the other hand, the physician was not without his objects in seeking this intimacy. He had his hands full with the recovery of his patient, and yet found time to push his researches into the spiritual world. It was his constant aim to bring into the daylight the hidden sin, the secret shame, which he suspected to be lurking in the soul of the minister. The townspeople, who had been in a state of considerable alarm respecting their young minister, were greatly relieved by this arrangement. They hailed it as a providential dispensation, and as the very best possible measure for Mr. Dimmesdale’s welfare, short of his marrying, which they deemed altogether out of the question, considering his holy character, and his determination to remain a bachelor. The house in which they were now lodged was one of the best in the town, and belonged to a pious widow, who, in her younger days, had been a friend of Mr. Dimmesdale’s mother. It was situated near the graveyard, which was considered a fitting neighborhood for a clergyman and a physician, both of whom had so much to do with death. The widow gave up to Mr. Dimmesdale the front room, which was the sunniest and most cheerful in the house, and which looked out upon the street. It was a large room, with a heavy carpet on the floor, and with curtains of a dark color, which could be drawn so as to exclude the light. The walls were hung with tapestry, representing the story of David and Bathsheba, and Nathan the Prophet, in figures of the size of life, and in colors which had been as vivid as life, but which were now somewhat faded. Here Mr. Dimmesdale had his library, which was a large one, and consisted chiefly of theological works, with a few volumes of poetry and history. On the opposite side of the house, Roger Chillingworth had his study and laboratory. It was a smaller room than Mr. Dimmesdale’s, and was not so well furnished. It contained a distilling apparatus, and a variety of chemical and medical preparations, which the physician was constantly compounding. In this comfortable arrangement, the two men lived together, each in his own apartment, but with free access to the other’s. They were often together, and their conversation was always on subjects of a serious nature. They were both men of learning, and they had much to say to each other. They were also men of observation, and they were not slow to observe each other’s peculiarities. Mr. Dimmesdale was a man of a nervous temperament, and was subject to fits of melancholy. He was also a man of a sensitive conscience, and was easily disturbed by anything that savored of sin. Roger Chillingworth was a man of a calm and equable temperament, and was not easily moved. He was a man of a penetrating mind, and was quick to perceive the hidden springs of action. He was also a man of a revengeful spirit, and was not slow to take advantage of any weakness that he might discover in his victim.",

But—it must now be said—another portion of the community had latterly begun to take its own view of the relation betwixt Mr. Dimmesdale and the mysterious old physician. When an uninstructed multitude attempts to see with its eyes, it is exceedingly apt to be deceived. When, however, it forms its judgment, as it usually does, on the intuitions of its great and warm heart, the conclusions thus attained are often so profound and so unerring, as to possess the character of truths supernaturally revealed. The people, in the case of which we speak, could justify its prejudice against Roger Chillingworth by no fact or argument worthy of serious refutation. There was an aged handicraftsman, it is true, who had been a citizen of London at the period of Sir Thomas Overbury’s murder, now some thirty years agone; he testified to having seen the physician, under some other name, which the narrator of the story had now forgotten, in company with Doctor Forman, the famous old conjurer, who was implicated in the affair of Overbury. Two or three individuals hinted, that the man of skill, during his Indian captivity, had enlarged his medical attainments by joining in the incantations of the savage priests; who were universally acknowledged to be powerful enchanters, often performing seemingly miraculous cures by their skill in the black art. A large number—and many of these were persons of such sober sense and practical observation that their opinions would have been valuable, in other matters—affirmed that Roger Chillingworth’s aspect had undergone a remarkable change while he had dwelt in town, and especially since his abode with Mr. Dimmesdale. At first, his expression had been calm, meditative, scholar-like. Now, there was something ugly and evil in his face, which they had not previously noticed, and which grew still the more obvious to sight, the oftener they looked upon him. According to the vulgar idea, the fire in his laboratory had been brought from the lower regions, and was fed with infernal fuel; and so, as might be expected, his visage was getting sooty with the smoke.\nTo sum up the matter, it grew to be a widely diffused opinion, that the Reverend Arthur Dimmesdale, like many other personages of especial sanctity, in all ages of the Christian world, was haunted either by Satan himself, or Satan’s emissary, in the guise of old Roger Chillingworth. This diabolical agent had the Divine permission, for a season, to burrow into the clergyman’s intimacy, and plot against his soul. No sensible man, it was confessed, could doubt on which side the victory would turn. The people looked, with an unshaken hope, to see the minister come forth out of the conflict, transfigured with the glory which he would unquestionably win. Meanwhile, nevertheless, it was sad to think of the perchance mortal agony through which he must struggle towards his triumph.\nAlas! to judge from the gloom and terror in the depths of the poor minister’s eyes, the battle was a sore one and the victory anything but secure.",

It was as if Heaven had heard the supplication of its people, and in pity for the suffering shepherd, had sent a skilled physician to minister to his bodily frame, which was evidently sinking under some hidden malady. This physician, newly arrived in the colony, was none other than Roger Chillingworth.  He had come, as he said, after a long residence among the Indians, where he had acquired a profound knowledge of the properties of native herbs and remedies, skills that were sorely needed in the fledgling settlement.  His aspect, at first glance, was calm and scholarly, with a wise, albeit somewhat cold, eye.  There was a subtle peculiarity in his expression, however, a keenness that seemed to pierce beneath the surface of things, and a certain reserve that hinted at a past shrouded in mystery.  The good people of Boston, seeing his learning and his apparent dedication to the minister’s welfare, welcomed him as a godsend.  They saw in him the instrument of divine mercy, a man sent to pluck their beloved pastor from the brink of the grave.  A close intimacy soon sprang up between the two men.  Dimmesdale, weakened by his secret anguish and the physical manifestations of his guilt, found a strange comfort in the physician’s presence.  Chillingworth, on his part, seemed to devote himself with singular earnestness to the study of his patient’s case.  He took up his abode in the same house with Dimmesdale, ostensibly to be constantly at hand, but in reality, to have the minister perpetually under his observation.  He watched him with an intensity that went beyond mere professional interest.  He studied his habits, his moods, the subtle changes in his complexion, the involuntary gestures of his hands, the tone of his voice, the very expression of his eyes.  He became, in essence, a psychological investigator, delving into the hidden depths of Dimmesdale’s soul under the guise of treating his physical ailments.  The minister, meanwhile, experienced a peculiar duality.  Outwardly, under Chillingworth’s care, he seemed to rally.  His sermons, though still marked by a tone of profound sadness and a veiled confession of sinfulness that the congregation interpreted as humility, gained a new power and pathos.  He spoke of human frailty, of the blackness of the human heart, of the impossibility of escaping divine judgment, with an eloquence that moved his listeners to tears.  Yet, inwardly, he was a battlefield.  His nights were tormented by visions and self-inflicted penances.  His days were a constant struggle against the gnawing worm of guilt.  And all the while, the physician, like a subtle leech, fastened himself upon his vitals, drawing forth not blood, but the very essence of his hidden suffering.  Chillingworth’s questions, seemingly innocent and medical, became increasingly pointed, probing the minister’s spiritual state, his conscience, his deepest secrets.  He sought to uncover the root cause of the malady, which he shrewdly suspected lay not in the body, but in the soul.  The minister, bound by his vow of secrecy and his fear of exposure, could not confess, yet the physician’s relentless scrutiny began to wear him down, making his life a living hell, a torment far exceeding the public shame of the scarlet letter."

He had begun an investigation, as he imagined, with the severe and equal integrity of a judge, desirous only of truth, even as if the question involved no more than the air-drawn lines and figures of a geometrical problem, instead of human passions, and wrongs inflicted on himself. But, as he proceeded, a terrible fascination, a kind of fierce, though still calm, necessity, seized the old man within its gripe, and never set him free again, until he had done all its bidding. He now dug into the poor clergyman’s heart, like a miner searching for gold; or, rather, like a sexton delving into a grave, possibly in quest of a jewel that had been buried on the dead man’s bosom, but likely to find nothing save mortality and corruption. Alas for his own soul, if these were what he sought!\nSometimes, a light glimmered out of the physician’s eyes, burning blue and ominous, like the reflection of a furnace, or, let us say, like one of those gleams of ghastly fire that darted from Bunyan’s awful doorway in the hillside, and quivered on the pilgrim’s face. The soil where this dark miner was working had perchance shown indications that encouraged him.\n“This man,” said he, at one such moment, to himself, “pure as they deem him,—all spiritual as he seems,—hath inherited a strong animal nature from his father or his mother. Let us dig a little further in the direction of this vein!”\nThen, after long search into the minister’s dim interior, and turning over many precious materials, in the shape of high aspirations for the welfare of his race, warm love of souls, pure sentiments, natural piety, strengthened by thought and study, and illuminated by revelation,—all of which invaluable gold was perhaps no better than rubbish to the seeker,—he would turn back, discouraged, and begin his quest towards another point. He groped along as stealthily, with as cautious a tread, and as wary an outlook, as a thief entering a chamber where a man lies only half asleep,—or, it may be, broad awake,—with purpose to steal the very treasure which this man guards as the apple of his eye. In spite of his premeditated carefulness, the floor would now and then creak; his garments would rustle; the shadow of his presence, in a forbidden proximity, would be thrown across his victim. In other words, Mr. Dimmesdale, whose sensibility of nerve often produced the effect of spiritual intuition, would become vaguely aware that something inimical to his peace had thrust itself into relation with him. But old Roger Chillingworth, too, had perceptions that were almost intuitive; and when the minister threw his startled eyes towards him, there the physician sat; his kind, watchful, sympathizing, but never intrusive friend.",

He had been scholarlike, too, and studious of books; a man of thought, and apt to derive his materials from whatever was remarkable in Nature or in History. Except for one flaw, and that a minor one, which he himself had long ago outgrown, and entirely cured, there need be no question of his moral integrity. It was his misfortune, however, to have ever held the human heart in the remotest corners of his regard, and to be utterly destitute of the tenderest and truest of its affections, and of the imaginative gracefulness that divinizes it. Nevertheless, with the acuteness of his mind, which even now was entirely unimpaired, he had assiduously cultivated its intellectual part. Thereby he had attained great proficiency in physical science, and likewise knew well the moral several remedies which might be applied to its distempers. As regarded his own personal character, he would fain have been thought a man of calm sagacity, profound benevolence, and unworldly wisdom. But the former characteristics would now be altogether inadmissible, to describe his nature, or his conduct. He appeared to have undergone a transformation; a change, and not for the better, was plainly visible in him, as he proceeded in the task which he had undertaken. To sum up the matter, Roger Chillingworth was a striking instance of a man who had grown ugly and evil-tempered from brooding over the fire of a heart that was kindling with some infernal passion. But what distinguished the physician's mode of investigation from all that has ever been recorded of the pursuit of knowledge, was the fact that, instead of seeking his material in Nature, he employed human nature, or, to be more precise, Arthur Dimmesdale's nature, as the field of his research. With the former physician, it was a science of external things, now, of the inner man. He knew well that Dimmesdale, what with the dread of public exposure, and what with the gnawing and poisonous tooth of bodily pain, and what with the profound disquietude of his soul, was suffering torture as hellish as could be devised; though Dimmesdale would not, and could not, acknowledge the presence of the fiend that was tormenting him. Chillingworth, therefore, gave up all his professional rights in the case, and became, as it were, a miner searching for gold; or, rather, a sexton delving into a grave, for something precious, that was hidden there. He was seeking, not for bodily disease, but for something that was hidden in the poor minister's heart; and he was doing it with a fiendish ingenuity, and a patience that was almost superhuman. He was like a thief, who, with a dark lantern, is searching for a hidden treasure in a house, and who, with every step, is in danger of being discovered. He was like a leech, indeed, that had fastened upon the minister, and was sucking his life-blood; but he was also like a physician, who, with a keen eye, is watching the symptoms of a disease, and who, with a steady hand, is applying the remedies. He was a man of skill, and he was a man of power. He had the power to heal, and he had the power to destroy. He was a man of science, and he was a man of art. He was a man of thought, and he was a man of action. He was a man of the world, and he was a man of the spirit. He was a man of God, and he was a man of the devil.

He had been a scholar, a man of thought, with a mild and studious aspect. But now, as he bent over the minister, or sat beside him, or walked with him, a terrible transformation had come over him. It was as if the very essence of his being had been distilled into a single, potent purpose – that of discovering and punishing the hidden sin of Arthur Dimmesdale. This purpose, like a corrosive acid, ate away at the gentle and humane qualities that had once characterized him. His face, once merely thoughtful, grew dark and sinister. His eyes, which had held a mild, speculative light, now gleamed with a fierce, searching intensity, like coals glowing in a hidden furnace.\nThe transformation was not merely spiritual; it manifested physically. His figure, which had been somewhat bent with study, seemed to contract and become more gnarled, as if the evil within were twisting his outward form. His features, sharp and keen, took on a look of malevolent cunning. He was no longer the benevolent physician seeking to heal, but a relentless inquisitor, probing the deepest recesses of a soul for evidence of guilt. The townspeople, observing him closely, began to whisper amongst themselves. They saw the change, though they could not fully comprehend its cause. They noted the cold, calculating look in his eyes, the way he seemed to fasten upon the minister with an almost predatory gaze. Some said that the old man was a leech, not just in his profession, but in a more sinister sense, sucking the life and soul out of the Reverend Mr. Dim"

I found them growing on a grave, which bore no tombstone, nor other memorial of the dead man, save these ugly weeds, that have taken upon themselves to keep him in remembrance. They grew out of his heart, and typify, it may be, some hideous secret that was buried with him, and which he had done better to confess during his lifetime.”\n“Perchance,” said Mr. Dimmesdale, “he earnestly desired it, but could not.”\n“And wherefore?” rejoined the physician. “Wherefore not; since all the powers of nature call so earnestly for the confession of sin, that these black weeds have sprung up out of a buried heart, to make manifest an unspoken crime?”\n“That, good Sir, is but a fantasy of yours,” replied the minister. “There can be, if I forebode aright, no power, short of the Divine mercy, to disclose, whether by uttered words, or by type or emblem, the secrets that may be buried with a human heart. The heart, making itself guilty of such secrets, must perforce hold them, until the day when all hidden things shall be revealed. Nor have I so read or interpreted Holy Writ, as to understand that the disclosure of human thoughts and deeds, then to be made, is intended as a part of the retribution. That, surely, were a shallow view of it. No; these revelations, unless I greatly err, are meant merely to promote the intellectual satisfaction of all intelligent beings, who will stand waiting, on that day, to see the dark problem of this life made plain. A knowledge of men’s hearts will be needful to the completest solution of that problem. And I conceive, moreover, that the hearts holding such miserable secrets as you speak of will yield them up, at that last day, not with reluctance, but with a joy unutterable.”\n“Then why not reveal them here?” asked Roger Chillingworth, glancing quietly aside at the minister. “Why should not the guilty ones sooner avail themselves of this unutterable solace?”\n“They mostly do,” said the clergyman, griping hard at his breast as if afflicted with an importunate throb of pain. “Many, many a poor soul hath given its confidence to me, not only on the death-bed, but while strong in life, and fair in reputation. And ever, after such an outpouring, O, what a relief have I witnessed in those sinful brethren! even as in one who at last draws free air, after long stifling with his own polluted breath. How can it be otherwise? Why should a wretched man, guilty, we will say, of murder, prefer to keep the dead corpse buried in his own heart, rather than fling it forth at once, and let the universe take care of it!”\n“Yet some men bury their secrets thus,” observed the calm physician.\n“True; there are such men,” answered Mr. Dimmesdale. “But, not to suggest more obvious reasons, it may be that they are kept silent by the very constitution of their nature. Or,—can we not suppose it?—guilty as they may be, retaining, nevertheless, a zeal for God’s glory and man’s welfare, they shrink from displaying themselves black and filthy in the view of men; because, thenceforward, no good can be achieved by them; no evil of the past be redeemed by better service. So, to their own unutterable torment, they go about among their fellow-creatures, looking pure as new-fallen snow while their hearts are all speckled and spotted with iniquity of which they cannot rid themselves.”",

Now, why should not the guilty soul find peace, in confiding its own sin and sorrow to the bosom of a brother?\" \"More than once, as you know,\" said Mr. Dimmesdale, laying his hand upon his breast, \"I have sought to avail myself of that privilege. I have spoken to you freely. I have laid open my heart to you.\" \"True,\" answered the physician; \"and yet, methinks, there is something that still eludes me. You have told me of your sorrows, of your struggles, of your temptations, and of the holy, or, as you say, the sinful passions of your heart. But, with all this, I have never yet been able to discover what it is that preys upon you thus.\" \"Why should a man lay open the innermost secrets of his heart to the inspection of a fellow-creature?\" asked Mr. Dimmesdale. \"Why should he not?\" rejoined Chillingworth. \"The heart, whose secrets are not told, corrodes and festers inwardly, and is the worse for being unbreathed.\" \"Not so,\" said Mr. Dimmesdale. \"It is not so.

By what right, then, while I myself am so dark and evil, does he talk to me of his sin?\" \"Nay, not so, not so!\" answered the physician. \"It is for the good of the soul to be rid of any such burden. At the day of judgment, the secrets of all hearts shall be revealed. Now, why should not the guilty soul find peace, in confiding its own sin and sorrow to the bosom of a brother?\" \"More than once, as you know,\" said Mr. Dimmesdale, laying his hand upon his breast, \"I have sought to avail myself of that privilege. I have spoken to you freely. I have laid open my heart to you.\" \"True,\" answered the physician; \"and yet, methinks, there is something that still eludes me. You have told me of your sorrows, of your struggles, of your temptations, and of the holy, or, as you say, the sinful passions of your heart. But, with all this, I have never yet been able to discover what it is that preys upon you thus.\" \"Why should a man lay open the innermost secrets of his heart to the inspection of a fellow-creature?\" asked Mr. Dimmesdale. \"Why should he not?\" rejoined Chillingworth. \"The heart, whose secrets are not told, corrodes and festers inwardly, and is the worse for being unbreathed.\" \"Not so,\" said Mr. Dimmesdale. \"It is not so. I have known many a man, I have known many a woman, with a secret burden, that they have longed to cast down, but could not. And why not? Because there was no hand to receive it.

Looking instinctively from the open window,—for it was summer-time,—the minister beheld Hester Prynne and little Pearl passing along the footpath that traversed the enclosure. Pearl looked as beautiful as the day, but was in one of those moods of perverse merriment which, whenever they occurred, seemed to remove her entirely out of the sphere of sympathy or human contact. She now skipped irreverently from one grave to another; until, coming to the broad, flat, armorial tombstone of a departed worthy,—perhaps of Isaac Johnson himself,—she began to dance upon it. In reply to her mother’s command and entreaty that she would behave more decorously, little Pearl paused to gather the prickly burrs from a tall burdock which grew beside the tomb. Taking a handful of these, she arranged them along the lines of the scarlet letter that decorated the maternal bosom, to which the burrs, as their nature was, tenaciously adhered. Hester did not pluck them off.\nRoger Chillingworth had by this time approached the window, and smiled grimly down.\n“There is no law, nor reverence for authority, no regard for human ordinances or opinions, right or wrong, mixed up with that child’s composition,” remarked he, as much to himself as to his companion. “I saw her, the other day, bespatter the Governor himself with water, at the cattle-trough in Spring Lane. What, in Heaven’s name, is she? Is the imp altogether evil? Hath she affections? Hath she any discoverable principle of being?”\n“None, save the freedom of a broken law,” answered Mr. Dimmesdale, in a quiet way, as if he had been discussing the point within himself. “Whether capable of good, I know not.”\nThe child probably overheard their voices; for, looking up to the window, with a bright, but naughty smile of mirth and intelligence, she threw one of the prickly burrs at the Reverend Mr. Dimmesdale. The sensitive clergyman shrunk, with nervous dread, from the light missile. Detecting his emotion, Pearl clapped her little hands, in the most extravagant ecstasy. Hester Prynne, likewise, had involuntarily looked up; and all these four persons, old and young, regarded one another in silence, till the child laughed aloud, and shouted,—“Come away, mother! Come away, or yonder old Black Man will catch you! He hath got hold of the minister already. Come away, mother, or he will catch you! But he cannot catch little Pearl!”\nSo she drew her mother away, skipping, dancing, and frisking fantastically, among the hillocks of the dead people, like a creature that had nothing in common with a bygone and buried generation, nor owned herself akin to it. It was as if she had been made afresh, out of new elements, and must perforce be permitted to live her own life, and be a law unto herself, without her eccentricities being reckoned to her for a crime.",

Is Hester Prynne the less miserable, think you, for that scarlet letter on her breast?”\n“I do verily believe it,” answered the clergyman. “Nevertheless, I cannot answer for her. There was a look of pain in her face, which I would gladly have been spared the sight of. But still, methinks, it must needs be better for the sufferer to be free to show his pain, as this poor woman Hester is, than to cover it all up in his heart.”\nThere was another pause; and the physician began anew to examine and arrange the plants which he had gathered.\n“You inquired of me, a little time agone,” said he, at length, “my judgment as touching your health.”\n“I did,” answered the clergyman, “and would gladly learn it. Speak frankly, I pray you, be it for life or death.”\n“Freely, then, and plainly,” said the physician, still busy with his plants, but keeping a wary eye on Mr. Dimmesdale, “the disorder is a strange one; not so much in itself, nor as outwardly manifested,—in so far, at least, as the symptoms have been laid open to my observation. Looking daily at you, my good Sir, and watching the tokens of your aspect, now for months gone by, I should deem you a man sore sick, it may be, yet not so sick but that an instructed and watchful physician might well hope to cure you. But—I know not what to say—the disease is what I seem to know, yet know it not.”\n“You speak in riddles, learned Sir,” said the pale minister, glancing aside out of the window.\n“Then, to speak more plainly,” continued the physician, “and I crave pardon, Sir,—should it seem to require pardon,—for this needful plainness of my speech. Let me ask,—as your friend,—as one having charge, under Providence, of your life and physical well-being,—hath all the operation of this disorder been fairly laid open and recounted to me?”\n“How can you question it?” asked the minister. “Surely, it were child’s play, to call in a physician, and then hide the sore!”\n“You would tell me, then, that I know all?” said Roger Chillingworth, deliberately, and fixing an eye, bright with intense and concentrated intelligence, on the minister’s face. “Be it so! But, again! He to whom only the outward and physical evil is laid open, knoweth, oftentimes, but half the evil which he is called upon to cure. A bodily disease, which we look upon as whole and entire within itself, may, after all, be but a symptom of some ailment in the spiritual part. Your pardon, once again, good Sir, if my speech give the shadow of offence. You, Sir, of all men whom I have known, are he whose body is the closest conjoined, and imbued, and identified, so to speak, with the spirit whereof it is the instrument.”\n“Then I need ask no further,” said the clergyman, somewhat hastily rising from his chair. “You deal not, I take it, in medicine for the soul!”\n“Thus, a sickness,” continued Roger Chillingworth, going on, in an unaltered tone, without heeding the interruption,—but standing up, and confronting the emaciated and white-cheeked minister, with his low, dark, and misshapen figure,—“a sickness, a sore place, if we may so call it, in your spirit, hath immediately its appropriate manifestation in your bodily frame. Would you, therefore, that your physician heal the bodily evil? How may this be, unless you first lay open to him the wound or trouble in your soul?”\n“No!—not to thee!—not to an earthly physician!” cried Mr. Dimmesdale, passionately, and turning his eyes, full and bright, and with a kind of fierceness, on old Roger Chillingworth. “Not to thee! But if it be the soul’s disease, then do I commit myself to the one Physician of the soul! He, if it stand with his good pleasure, can cure; or he can kill! Let him do with me as, in his justice and wisdom, he shall see good. But who art thou, that meddlest in this matter?—that dares thrust himself between the sufferer and his God?”",

The young clergyman, after a few hours of privacy, was sensible that the disorder of his nerves had hurried him into an unseemly outbreak of temper, which there had been nothing in the physician’s words to excuse or palliate. He marvelled, indeed, at the violence with which he had thrust back the kind old man, when merely proffering the advice which it was his duty to bestow, and which the minister himself had expressly sought. With these remorseful feelings, he lost no time in making the amplest apologies, and besought his friend still to continue the care, which, if not successful in restoring him to health, had, in all probability, been the means of prolonging his feeble existence to that hour.

It must have been a work of vast ability in the somniferous school of literature. The profound depth of the minister’s repose was the more remarkable, inasmuch as he was one of those persons whose sleep, ordinarily, is as light, as fitful, and as easily scared away, as a small bird hopping on a twig. To such an unwonted remoteness, however, had his spirit now withdrawn into itself, that he stirred not in his chair, when old Roger Chillingworth, without any extraordinary precaution, came into the room. The physician advanced directly in front of his patient, laid his hand upon his bosom, and thrust aside the vestment, that, hitherto, had always covered it even from the professional eye.\nThen, indeed, Mr. Dimmesdale shuddered, and slightly stirred.\nAfter a brief pause, the physician turned away.\nBut, with what a wild look of wonder, joy, and horror!

Were it only for the art’s sake, I must penetrate further into the mystery!”\n\nNot long after, finding Mr. Dimmesdale asleep in his chair, with a large black-letter volume open upon his knees, and his head resting upon the hand that had just been writing, Roger Chillingworth stooped to examine his patient’s breast. A writhing horror twisted itself across his features, like a snake gliding swiftly over them, and making all hideous by its passage. He withdrew his hand, and stood long looking at the minister, with the deepest thoughtfulness. Meanwhile, the physician’s eye fell on the embroidered scarlet letter, which Hester Prynne had wrought so skilfully, and was now conspicuous on her bosom. With her firm shape, her glowing cheeks, and dark, glossy hair, and bold black eyes, she looked like the very embodiment of the scarlet sin that had been made of her, and not less so than if the letter were more than a mere symbol, and had imparted its own vital effluence to draw the wearer into its sphere. Her infant, a wild and direcful creature of a noble aspect, sat playing on the floor, and gazing at Roger Chillingworth with a laughing defiance, that was yet full of childish mirth. This gleam of sunshine on the floor, with her mother’s scarlet letter dancing in the midst of it, must needs produce a strange effect on the physician’s eye. It was like a mask, which the Devil might have worn upon the face of a lost soul, when he came to claim it for his own. But the physician knew his patient well, and could interpret the meaning of every symptom, the slightest blush, the faintest tremor, the most inaudible sigh. He knew that the minister’s heart was a battlefield, where the forces of good and evil were contending for the mastery. He knew that the minister’s soul was a dark and troubled sea, where the waves of remorse and despair were forever beating against the shores of hope and faith. He knew that the minister’s life was a long and painful struggle, between the desire to confess and the fear of exposure.

Were it only for the art’s sake, I must penetrate further into the mystery!”\n\nNot long after, finding Mr. Dimmesdale asleep in his chair, with a large black-letter volume open upon his knees, and his head resting upon the hand that had just been writing, Roger Chillingworth stooped to examine his patient’s breast. A writhing horror twisted itself across his features, like a snake gliding swiftly over them, and making all hideous by its passage. He withdrew his hand, and stood long looking at the minister, with the deepest thoughtfulness. Meanwhile, the physician’s eye fell on the embroidered scarlet letter, which Hester Prynne had wrought so skilfully, and was now conspicuous on her bosom. With her firm shape, her glowing cheeks, and dark, glossy hair, and bold black eyes, she looked like the very embodiment of the scarlet sin that had been made of her, and not less so than if the letter were more than a mere symbol, and had imparted its own vital effluence to draw the wearer into its sphere. Her infant, a wild and direcful creature of a noble aspect, sat playing on the floor, and gazing at Roger Chillingworth with a laughing defiance, that was yet full of childish mirth. This gleam of sunshine on the floor, with her mother’s scarlet letter dancing in the midst of it, must needs produce a strange effect on the physician’s eye. It was like a mask, which the Devil might have worn upon the face of a lost soul, when he came to claim it for his own. But the physician knew his patient well, and could interpret the meaning of every symptom, the slightest blush, the faintest tremor, the most inaudible sigh. He knew that the minister’s heart was a battlefield, where the forces of good and evil were contending for the mastery. He knew that the minister’s soul was a dark and troubled sea, where the waves of remorse and despair were forever beating against the shores of hope and faith. He knew that the minister’s life was a long and painful struggle, between the desire to confess and the fear of exposure.

          "text_segment": "AFTER the incident last described, the intercourse between the clergyman and the physician, though externally the same, was really of another character than it had previously been. The intellect of Roger Chillingworth had now a sufficiently plain path before it. It was not, indeed, precisely that which he had laid out for himself to tread. Calm, gentle, passionless, as he appeared, there was yet, we fear, a quiet depth of malice, hitherto latent, but active now, in this unfortunate old man, which led him to imagine a more intimate revenge than any mortal had ever wreaked upon an enemy. To make himself the one trusted friend, to whom should be confided all the fear, the remorse, the agony, the ineffectual repentance, the backward rush of sinful thoughts, expelled in vain! All that guilty sorrow, hidden from the world, whose great heart would have pitied and forgiven, to be revealed to him, the Pitiless, to him, the Unforgiving! All that dark treasure to be lavished on the very man, to whom nothing else could so adequately pay the debt of vengeance!\nThe clergyman’s shy and sensitive reserve had balked this scheme. Roger Chillingworth, however, was inclined to be hardly, if at all, less satisfied with the aspect of affairs, which Providence—using the avenger and his victim for its own purposes, and, perchance, pardoning where it seemed most to punish—had substituted for his black devices. A revelation, he could almost say, had been granted to him. It mattered little, for his object, whether celestial, or from what other region. By its aid, in all the subsequent relations betwixt him and Mr. Dimmesdale, not merely the external presence, but the very inmost soul, of the latter, seemed to be brought out before his eyes, so that he could see and comprehend its every movement. He became, thenceforth, not a spectator only, but a chief actor, in the poor minister’s interior world. He could play upon him as he chose. Would he arouse him with a throb of agony? The victim was forever on the rack; it needed only to know the spring that controlled the engine;—and the physician knew it well! Would he startle him with sudden fear? As at the waving of a magician’s wand, uprose a grisly phantom,—uprose a thousand phantoms,—in many shapes, of death, or more awful shame, all flocking round about the clergyman, and pointing with their fingers at his breast!\nAll this was accomplished with a subtlety so perfect, that the minister, though he had constantly a dim perception of some evil influence watching over him, could never gain a knowledge of its actual nature. True, he looked doubtfully, fearfully,—even, at times, with horror and the bitterness of hatred,—at the deformed figure of the old physician. His gestures, his gait, his grizzled beard, his slightest and most indifferent acts, the very fashion of his garments, were odious in the clergyman’s sight; a token implicitly to be relied on, of a deeper antipathy in the breast of the latter than he was willing to acknowledge to himself. For, as it was impossible to assign a reason for such distrust and abhorrence, so Mr. Dimmesdale, conscious that the poison of one morbid spot was infecting his heart’s entire substance, attributed all his presentiments to no other cause. He took himself to task for his bad sympathies in reference to Roger Chillingworth, disregarded the lesson that he should have drawn from them, and did his best to root them out. Unable to accomplish this, he nevertheless, as a matter of principle, continued his habits of social familiarity with the old man, and thus gave him constant opportunities for perfecting the purpose to which—poor, forlorn creature that he was, and more wretched than his victim—the avenger had devoted himself.",

Roger Chillingworth, no longer a physician ministering to a patient, but a subtle, malignant investigator of the human heart, had found his victim. The brief, almost involuntary confession wrung from Dimmesdale upon the scaffold, though veiled in ambiguity to the public ear, had been a clear and damning revelation to the man who had so long sought the truth. From that moment, the bond between them, once forged in a semblance of medical necessity and spiritual counsel, became a chain of iron, binding the sufferer to his tormentor. Their shared dwelling, once a place of quiet study and supposed healing, transformed into a psychological battleground, a chamber of horrors where the physician, with cold, calculating precision, probed the festering wound of the minister's soul. There was no longer any pretense of seeking a physical ailment; Chillingworth's gaze, sharp and penetrating, was fixed solely upon the hidden sin, the secret agony that consumed Dimmesdale from within. He watched the minister's every gesture, listened to every sigh, every inflection of his voice, seeking confirmation, seeking fuel for the slow fire he intended to keep burning in the poor wretch's breast. His questions, seemingly innocent inquiries about the minister's health or state of mind, were now barbed hooks, designed to snag upon the raw nerve of guilt. He spoke of hidden diseases, of the connection between the soul's sickness and the body's decay, of confessions that might bring relief – all with a chilling undertone that left Dimmesdale trembling, though he could not articulate the source of his dread. The minister, on his part, felt an increasing, though still vague, horror of his companion. The physician's presence became an intolerable burden, a shadow that clung to him, a constant reminder of his secret and the ever-present threat of its exposure. He longed to flee, to escape the oppressive atmosphere of their shared rooms, but felt himself bound by an invisible force, perhaps his own weakness, perhaps the physician's insidious power. He began to suspect, with a dawning terror, that Chillingworth was not merely a physician, but something far more sinister – a fiend, perhaps, sent to torment him for his sins. Yet, even this suspicion was vague and fleeting, often dismissed as the product of his own fevered imagination and guilty conscience. He could not bring himself to confront the man, to demand an explanation, or to cast him out. His will was sapped, his spirit broken by years of secret suffering and the relentless pressure of Chillingworth's psychological assault. The physician, meanwhile, reveled in his power. He saw the minister's agony, the physical wasting, the spiritual torment, and felt a grim satisfaction. His revenge was not to be swift and public, but slow, agonizing, and deeply personal. He was dissecting a living heart, observing its death throes with the detached curiosity of a scientist, yet with the malicious glee of a devil. The townspeople, blind to the drama unfolding within the minister's dwelling, continued to revere Dimmesdale as a saint and to praise Chillingworth as a wise and benevolent physician, sent by Providence to care for their beloved pastor. They saw only the outward show – the minister's eloquent sermons, his saintly pallor, his hand pressed perpetually over his heart; the physician's grave demeanor, his learned discourse, his apparent solicitude. They could not see the invisible chains, the psychological torture, the slow, deliberate destruction of a soul that was taking place behind closed doors. Thus, the relationship between Arthur"

There were men, too, of a sturdier texture of mind than his, and endowed with a far greater share of shrewd, hard, iron, or granite understanding; which, duly mingled with a fair proportion of doctrinal ingredient, constitutes a highly respectable, efficacious, and unamiable variety of the clerical species. There were others, again, true saintly fathers, whose faculties had been elaborated by weary toil among their books, and by patient thought, and etherealized, moreover, by spiritual communications with the better world, into which their purity of life had almost introduced these holy personages, with their garments of mortality still clinging to them. All that they lacked was the gift that descended upon the chosen disciples at Pentecost, in tongues of flame; symbolizing, it would seem, not the power of speech in foreign and unknown languages, but that of addressing the whole human brotherhood in the heart’s native language. These fathers, otherwise so apostolic, lacked Heaven’s last and rarest attestation of their office, the Tongue of Flame. They would have vainly sought—had they ever dreamed of seeking—to express the highest truths through the humblest medium of familiar words and images. Their voices came down, afar and indistinctly, from the upper heights where they habitually dwelt.\nNot improbably, it was to this latter class of men that Mr. Dimmesdale, by many of his traits of character, naturally belonged. To the high mountain-peaks of faith and sanctity he would have climbed, had not the tendency been thwarted by the burden, whatever it might be, of crime or anguish, beneath which it was his doom to totter. It kept him down, on a level with the lowest; him, the man of ethereal attributes, whose voice the angels might else have listened to and answered! But this very burden it was, that gave him sympathies so intimate with the sinful brotherhood of mankind; so that his heart vibrated in unison with theirs, and received their pain into itself, and sent its own throb of pain through a thousand other hearts, in gushes of sad, persuasive eloquence. Oftenest persuasive, but sometimes terrible! The people knew not the power that moved them thus. They deemed the young clergyman a miracle of holiness. They fancied him the mouthpiece of Heaven’s messages of wisdom, and rebuke, and love. In their eyes, the very ground on which he trod was sanctified. The virgins of his church grew pale around him, victims of a passion so imbued with religious sentiment that they imagined it to be all religion, and brought it openly, in their white bosoms, as their most acceptable sacrifice before the altar. The aged members of his flock, beholding Mr. Dimmesdale’s frame so feeble, while they were themselves so rugged in their infirmity, believed that he would go heavenward before them, and enjoined it upon their children, that their old bones should be buried close to their young pastor’s holy grave. And, all this time, perchance, when poor Mr. Dimmesdale was thinking of his grave, he questioned with himself whether the grass would ever grow on it, because an accursed thing must there be buried!",

            "prefix-probing": "While thus suffering under bodily disease, and gnawed and tortured by some black trouble of the soul, and given over to the machinations of his deadliest enemy, the Reverend Mr. Dimmesdale had achieved a brilliant popularity in his sacred office. He was reverenced, loved, and almost adored. The further he sank into the pit of bodily decay and mental anguish, the more he seemed to be endowed with an ethereal radiance, a saintly glow, that captivated the hearts of his parishioners. They saw his suffering, his emaciation, his frequent hand pressed over his heart, not as signs of a hidden crime, but as the marks of a man wrestling mightily with the powers of darkness on behalf of his flock, a man whose earthly frame was too frail to contain the vastness of his spiritual fervor. His voice, though often weak and tremulous in private converse, gained a miraculous strength and pathos when he stood in the pulpit. It was as if the very agony of his soul lent it a deeper resonance, a more profound understanding of human sorrow and sin. His sermons, therefore, were not mere theological dissertations; they were outpourings of a heart that knew the bitterness of transgression, though the congregation, in their innocent faith, interpreted his self-condemnation as the humility of a truly holy man, acutely aware of the slightest deviation from divine perfection. He spoke of sin, of the universal sinfulness of man, with such passionate eloquence, such vivid imagery of the torments of a guilty conscience, that his hearers were moved to tears, to fervent prayer, to a deeper sense of their own need for salvation. They felt that their minister, this saintly man, was plumbing the very depths of human depravity alongside them, guiding them through the darkness by the light of his own perceived purity. The irony was profound and terrible. The more he hinted at his own unworthiness, the more he scourged himself with vague, generalized confessions of being the chief of sinners, the higher he rose in their estimation. They would whisper among themselves, 'Surely, there is no man on earth so pure, so saintly, as our minister! He sees the blackness of sin even in his own spotless soul!' And all the while, the scarlet letter was burning on Hester Prynne's bosom, a visible, tangible symbol of the very sin he dared not name, the sin that was consuming him from within. His popularity became a new source of torment. The adoration of the multitude felt like a mockery, a cruel jest played upon his hidden agony. He longed to confess, to stand forth in the light of day and reveal himself as the wretch he knew himself to be, but the moment never seemed right, the courage always failed him. Instead, he sought penance in secret, solitary acts of self-mortification. He would fast until his knees trembled and his vision blurred. He would keep vigils through the long, cold nights, sometimes standing on the scaffold where Hester had stood, a phantom of guilt in the moonlit square, but finding no peace, no absolution, only a deeper chill in his bones and soul. He would scourge his own flesh with a bloody whip, seeking physical pain as a counter-irritant to the unbearable anguish of his spirit, hoping perhaps to find in bodily suffering a semblance of the punishment he deserved but dared not face publicly. Yet, these acts of penance, born of a desperate need to atone, only served to further weaken his already fragile constitution and deepen the chasm between his public image and his private reality. And always, there was Roger Chillingworth, the physician, the fiend, watching him with those cold, penetrating eyes, subtly probing his wound, administering remedies that were poisons, whispering words that were barbs. Chillingworth had become the keeper of his secret, the silent witness to his decay, and the architect of his prolonged torment"

It was his genuine impulse to adore the truth, and to reckon all things shadow-like, and utterly devoid of weight or value, that had not its divine essence as the life within their life. Then, what was he?—a substance?—or the dimmest of all shadows? He longed to speak out, from his own pulpit, at the full height of his voice, and tell the people what he was. “I, whom you behold in these black garments of the priesthood,—I, who ascend the sacred desk, and turn my pale face heavenward, taking upon myself to hold communion, in your behalf, with the Most High Omniscience,—I, in whose daily life you discern the sanctity of Enoch,—I, whose footsteps, as you suppose, leave a gleam along my earthly track, whereby the pilgrims that shall come after me may be guided to the regions of the blest,—I, who have laid the hand of baptism upon your children,—I, who have breathed the parting prayer over your dying friends, to whom the Amen sounded faintly from a world which they had quitted,—I, your pastor, whom you so reverence and trust, am utterly a pollution and a lie!”\nMore than once, Mr. Dimmesdale had gone into the pulpit, with a purpose never to come down its steps, until he should have spoken words like the above. More than once, he had cleared his throat, and drawn in the long, deep, and tremulous breath, which, when sent forth again, would come burdened with the black secret of his soul. More than once—nay, more than a hundred times—he had actually spoken! Spoken! But how? He had told his hearers that he was altogether vile, a viler companion of the vilest, the worst of sinners, an abomination, a thing of unimaginable iniquity; and that the only wonder was, that they did not see his wretched body shrivelled up before their eyes, by the burning wrath of the Almighty! Could there be plainer speech than this? Would not the people start up in their seats, by a simultaneous impulse, and tear him down out of the pulpit which he defiled? Not so, indeed! They heard it all, and did but reverence him the more. They little guessed what deadly purport lurked in those self-condemning words. “The godly youth!” said they among themselves. “The saint on earth! Alas, if he discern such sinfulness in his own white soul, what horrid spectacle would he behold in thine or mine!” The minister well knew—subtle, but remorseful hypocrite that he was!—the light in which his vague confession would be viewed. He had striven to put a cheat upon himself by making the avowal of a guilty conscience, but had gained only one other sin, and a self-acknowledged shame, without the momentary relief of being self-deceived. He had spoken the very truth, and transformed it into the veriest falsehood. And yet, by the constitution of his nature, he loved the truth, and loathed the lie, as few men ever did. Therefore, above all things else, he loathed his miserable self!",

            "prefix-probing": "It is inconceivable, the agony with which this public veneration tortured him!  They deemed him a saint on earth, a man whose very breath was prayer, whose footsteps hallowed the ground, whose words were pearls of wisdom dropped from the lips of an angel. They saw the pallor of his cheek, the feebleness of his frame, the spiritual fire in his eyes, and interpreted them as the signs of a soul too pure, too ethereal, for the grossness of mortal existence. They attributed his suffering to the intensity of his communion with the divine, to the burden of their collective sins which he, in his boundless charity, took upon himself.  And he, the wretched man, stood before them, a living lie, a whited sepulchre, full of dead men's bones and all uncleanness.  Every word of praise was a lash upon his conscience, every look of adoration a searing brand upon his soul.  He longed to shriek aloud, to tear off the mask of sanctity, to reveal himself in all his vileness, to stand side by side with Hester Prynne, sharing the ignominy he so richly deserved.  But the power to do so was denied him.  A craven fear, a spiritual paralysis, held him captive.  He was bound by the very chains of his reputation, a prisoner of the pedestal upon which they had placed him.  His nights were a torment of sleeplessness and self-inflicted penance. He scourged himself, he fasted until his strength failed, he kept vigils in the darkness, his mind a battlefield of remorse and despair.  He would stand before his mirror, holding a candle, and gaze upon his own wasted form, seeking some outward manifestation of the rot within.  He saw the lines of suffering etched upon his face, the hollowness of his eyes, and knew that these were not the marks of divine grace, but the stigmata of his hidden sin.  He would frame a confession, rehearse it in the solitude of his study, imagine the horrified faces of his congregation, the shattering of their faith in him.  But when the moment came, when he stood in the pulpit, the words would die on his lips, replaced by eloquent pronouncements on the nature of sin in general, on the universal depravity of mankind – truths which, coming from him, seemed only to deepen the illusion of his own purity.  He spoke of a hidden sin, a secret agony, a worm gnawing at the root of his being, and they, in their blindness, took it as a testament to his profound humility, his awareness of the slightest imperfection in his saintly soul.  Oh, the bitter irony!  The more he hinted at his guilt, the more they revered him.  The more he suffered, the more they believed him to be touched by God.  And all the while, the leech, Roger Chillingworth, fastened upon him, probing the wound, injecting his venom, ensuring that the agony never ceased, that the truth remained buried, festering beneath the surface of his saintly facade.  The minister was a man divided against himself, his outward life a radiant lie, his inner life a hell of unconfessed sin and unbearable torment.  He walked among them, a phantom of holiness, haunted by the reality of his fall, his heart a constant ache, his spirit a perpetual battlefield."

Oftentimes, this Protestant and Puritan divine had plied it on his own shoulders; laughing bitterly at himself the while, and smiting so much the more pitilessly because of that bitter laugh. It was his custom, too, as it has been that of many other pious Puritans, to fast,—not, however, like them, in order to purify the body and render it the fitter medium of celestial illumination, but rigorously, and until his knees trembled beneath him, as an act of penance. He kept vigils, likewise, night after night, sometimes in utter darkness; sometimes with a glimmering lamp; and sometimes, viewing his own face in a looking-glass, by the most powerful light which he could throw upon it. He thus typified the constant introspection wherewith he tortured, but could not purify, himself. In these lengthened vigils, his brain often reeled, and visions seemed to flit before him; perhaps seen doubtfully, and by a faint light of their own, in the remote dimness of the chamber, or more vividly, and close beside him, within the looking-glass. Now it was a herd of diabolic shapes, that grinned and mocked at the pale minister, and beckoned him away with them; now a group of shining angels, who flew upward heavily, as sorrow-laden, but grew more ethereal as they rose. Now came the dead friends of his youth, and his white-bearded father, with a saint-like frown, and his mother, turning her face away as she passed by. Ghost of a mother,—thinnest fantasy of a mother,—methinks she might yet have thrown a pitying glance towards her son!

The same platform or scaffold, black and weather-stained with the storm or sunshine of seven long years, and foot-worn, too, with the tread of many culprits who had since ascended it, remained standing beneath the balcony of the meeting-house. The minister went up the steps.\nIt was an obscure night of early May. An unvaried pall of cloud muffled the whole expanse of sky from zenith to horizon. If the same multitude which had stood as eye-witnesses while Hester Prynne sustained her punishment could now have been summoned forth, they would have discerned no face above the platform, nor hardly the outline of a human shape, in the dark gray of the midnight. But the town was all asleep. There was no peril of discovery. The minister might stand there, if it so pleased him, until morning should redden in the east, without other risk than that the dank and chill night-air would creep into his frame, and stiffen his joints with rheumatism, and clog his throat with catarrh and cough; thereby defrauding the expectant audience of to-morrow’s prayer and sermon. No eye could see him, save that ever-wakeful one which had seen him in his closet, wielding the bloody scourge. Why, then, had he come hither? Was it but the mockery of penitence? A mockery, indeed, but in which his soul trifled with itself! A mockery at which angels blushed and wept, while fiends rejoiced, with jeering laughter! He had been driven hither by the impulse of that Remorse which dogged him everywhere, and whose own sister and closely linked companion was that Cowardice which invariably drew him back, with her tremulous gripe, just when the other impulse had hurried him to the verge of a disclosure. Poor, miserable man! what right had infirmity like his to burden itself with crime? Crime is for the iron-nerved, who have their choice either to endure it, or, if it press too hard, to exert their fierce and savage strength for a good purpose, and fling it off at once! This feeble and most sensitive of spirits could do neither, yet continually did one thing or another, which intertwined, in the same inextricable knot, the agony of heaven-defying guilt and vain repentance.\nAnd thus, while standing on the scaffold, in this vain show of expiation, Mr. Dimmesdale was overcome with a great horror of mind, as if the universe were gazing at a scarlet token on his naked breast, right over his heart. On that spot, in very truth, there was, and there had long been, the gnawing and poisonous tooth of bodily pain. Without any effort of his will, or power to restrain himself, he shrieked aloud; an outcry that went pealing through the night, and was beaten back from one house to another, and reverberated from the hills in the background; as if a company of devils, detecting so much misery and terror in it, had made a plaything of the sound, and were bandying it to and fro.\n“It is done!” muttered the minister, covering his face with his hands. “The whole town will awake, and hurry forth, and find me here!”",

He knew not whether he was awake, or asleep, or in some state betwixt waking and sleeping. Nevertheless, there he was. It was a dark night, since the midnight hour was now past, and the old church-steeple had just finished telling twelve. The clock of the town-house, and the dial of the old South church, had both been born about the same period, and gave the same promise of longevity in their sturdy infancy. But, at this dark hour, the voice of one only was heard among them; the great clock of the church-steeple. All the town was asleep. There was no living man that knew of his vigils, unless it were God, and angels, and departed spirits. There, on the platform of the pillory, stood the clergyman of Boston, holding his hand over his heart, at midnight, that the redoubtable Mr. Bellingham, nor the reverend Mr. Wilson, nor the aged and pious Mr. Cotton, nor any of the magisterial and reverend elders, who were his brethren in the church, nor the governor, nor the judges, nor the town-major, nor the selectmen, nor the constables, nor the townspeople, alive or dead, who had been nearest to him in life, would have dreamed of finding him there. But there he was, nevertheless; like a ghost that had stolen out of a sepulchre. He had climbed upon the platform, as it were, in a dream. As in a dream, he still stood there. The minister's soul was now tortured, between the dreadful agony of remorse, and the bitter mockery of penitence. It was his genuine impulse to mount the scaffold; it was his genuine impulse to stand there, with the scarlet letter flaming on his breast; and, if old Roger Chillingworth had chanced to pass, he would have shouted after him, with the dreadful cry that was ringing in his soul! It was his genuine impulse to turn his white face heavenward, and shriek out, there, before the assembled universe, his guilt, his shame, and agony! But this impulse was only the momentary relief of a gush of agony. Ere he had time to speak, it was gone. The moment that he sought to realize it, it eluded him, and left him still a prisoner of the scarlet letter, but not its champion. He was, in truth, a coward. Conscience, the agony of sin, had driven him to the verge of disclosure. But there he stood, a pale, trembling, miserable man, upon the platform of the pillory, and beneath the frown of the sky, awaiting the moment when the blackness of the cloud should be rent asunder, and the lightning flash forth, and show him, standing there, with the scarlet letter on his breast! But it was all in vain. The blackness of the cloud remained. The lightning came not. The minister's spirit was a poor, feebler, wretch than it had been before. He had been driven hither by the impulse of remorse, which was now tormenting him with a tenfold bitterness.

The same scaffold on which she had stood, he now ascended. It was a ghastly elevation, where a man might be exposed to the gaze of the whole town, and where, through the medium of the spiritual sense, he might perceive the hidden character of a whole town, and of himself. There he stood, a man of more than middle age, with a white, wasted face, in limbo between the world of substance and the world of shadow. He shivered, not with cold, but with a nameless horror, a dread of the very ground he stood upon, which had been consecrated by the public shame of another, and which he felt ought to have been consecrated by his own. The night was dark, but not absolutely without light. A few stars glimmered, and the air was chill. He stretched forth his hands, and clasped the wood of the scaffold, as if to assure himself that it was real. Yes, it was the very platform where the woman of the scarlet letter had stood, and where he, the secret partner of her sin, now stood in the depth of night, hidden from all eyes save those of the Omniscient. A wild, desperate impulse seized him. He felt a need to shriek aloud, to make the sleeping town aware that its saintly minister was a hypocrite, a man of sin, standing on the very pillory where he should have stood years ago. He opened his mouth, and a cry, hoarse and broken, came forth. It was not a loud cry, but it had in it the agony of a lifetime. He instantly clapped his hand over his mouth, fearing he had awakened the town. But the silence remained unbroken, save for the distant baying of a dog. He laughed then, a strange, hysterical laugh, born of despair and relief. Despair at his own cowardice, relief that his secret was still safe. As he stood there, a figure emerged from the darkness at the foot of the scaffold. It was Hester Prynne, leading little Pearl by the hand. They had been watching by the bedside of Governor Winthrop, who was dying. Dimmesdale called to them, and they ascended the steps to join him on the platform. There, in the solitude of the night, the three stood together, a strange, unholy family group, bound by a shared secret and a shared suffering. As they stood thus, a great meteor blazed across the sky, illuminating the scene with an unearthly light. It left behind it a trail of fire, which, to Dimmesdale's fevered imagination, took the shape of a gigantic letter 'A'. He saw it as a sign from Heaven, a revelation of his hidden sin, a celestial scarlet letter emblazoned upon the night sky for all to see. He trembled, convinced that the townspeople, if they had been awake, must have seen it too, and understood its terrible meaning. But Hester and Pearl saw only a meteor, a beautiful, fleeting light in the darkness. The minister, however, saw his doom written in the heavens."

The town did not awake; or, if it did, the drowsy slumberers mistook the cry either for something frightful in a dream, or for the noise of witches; whose voices, at that period, were often heard to pass over the settlements or lonely cottages, as they rode with Satan through the air. The clergyman, therefore, hearing no symptoms of disturbance, uncovered his eyes and looked about him. At one of the chamber-windows of Governor Bellingham’s mansion, which stood at some distance, on the line of another street, he beheld the appearance of the old magistrate himself, with a lamp in his hand, a white night-cap on his head, and a long white gown enveloping his figure. He looked like a ghost, evoked unseasonably from the grave. The cry had evidently startled him. At another window of the same house, moreover, appeared old Mistress Hibbins, the Governor’s sister, also with a lamp, which, even thus far off, revealed the expression of her sour and discontented face. She thrust forth her head from the lattice, and looked anxiously upward. Beyond the shadow of a doubt, this venerable witch-lady had heard Mr. Dimmesdale’s outcry, and interpreted it, with its multitudinous echoes and reverberations, as the clamor of the fiends and night-hags, with whom she was well known to make excursions into the forest.\nDetecting the gleam of Governor Bellingham’s lamp, the old lady quickly extinguished her own, and vanished. Possibly, she went up among the clouds. The minister saw nothing further of her motions. The magistrate, after a wary observation of the darkness,—into which, nevertheless, he could see but little further than he might into a mill-stone,—retired from the window.",

It threw a gleam of recognition on here a post, and there a garden-fence, and here a latticed window-pane, and there a pump, with its full trough of water, and here, again, an arched door of oak, with an iron knocker, and a rough log for the doorstep. The Reverend Mr. Dimmesdale noted all these minute particulars, even while firmly convinced that the doom of his existence was stealing onward, in the footsteps which he now heard; and that the gleam of the lantern would fall upon him, in a few moments more, and reveal his long-hidden secret. As the light drew nearer, he beheld, within its illuminated circle, his brother clergyman,—or, to speak more accurately, his professional father, as well as highly valued friend,—the Reverend Mr. Wilson; who, as Mr. Dimmesdale now conjectured, had been praying at the bedside of some dying man. And so he had. The good old minister came freshly from the death-chamber of Governor Winthrop, who had passed from earth to heaven within that very hour. And now, surrounded, like the saint-like personages of olden times, with a radiant halo, that glorified him amid this gloomy night of sin,—as if the departed Governor had left him an inheritance of his glory, or as if he had caught upon himself the distant shine of the celestial city, while looking thitherward to see the triumphant pilgrim pass within its gates,—now, in short, good Father Wilson was moving homeward, aiding his footsteps with a lighted lantern! The glimmer of this luminary suggested the above conceits to Mr. Dimmesdale, who smiled,—nay, almost laughed at them,—and then wondered if he were going mad.\nAs the Reverend Mr. Wilson passed beside the scaffold, closely muffling his Geneva cloak about him with one arm, and holding the lantern before his breast with the other, the minister could hardly restrain himself from speaking.\n“A good evening to you, venerable Father Wilson! Come up hither, I pray you, and pass a pleasant hour with me!”\nGood heavens! Had Mr. Dimmesdale actually spoken? For one instant, he believed that these words had passed his lips. But they were uttered only within his imagination. The venerable Father Wilson continued to step slowly onward, looking carefully at the muddy pathway before his feet, and never once turning his head towards the guilty platform. When the light of the glimmering lantern had faded quite away, the minister discovered, by the faintness which came over him, that the last few moments had been a crisis of terrible anxiety; although his mind had made an involuntary effort to relieve itself by a kind of lurid playfulness.",

Beautiful clouds of new gold and crimson intermixed with a sombre purple, and streaks of melancholy grey, were brooding over the eastern horizon; and at the same time, the moon from the opposite quarter of the heavens, shone brightly on the platform where Dimmesdale stood, and showed him the familiar shape of the market-place, the church itself, the old burial-ground, and the passing foot-passengers, all so unaltered, and akin to his everyday life, that an instant longer would have persuaded him that he was dreaming the whole matter, and that the scaffold in the market-place was but a theatre and a dream.  But we should hardly need to say that his sense of reality was very imperfectly restored, when we consider the dark valley of dimness into which his soul had strayed.  He was half-minded to shout aloud, and wake the sleepers in the vicinity.  But he bethought himself of the scandal that would ensue, and refrained.  Towards the church, however, Dimmesdale discerned an approaching light.  It was carrying by the sexton, who had charge of the sacred edifice, and who was now bringing the Reverend Mr. Wilson back from some death-chamber, in a distant street, whither his professional services had been required.  The good old minister came steadily along, carrying his lantern in his hand, swinging it to and fro, as if to drive away the nightly fantasms that, with fresh vigour, were bleating forth from the church-tower, and flitting bat-like about the eaves and gables.  Dimmesdale shuddered, and for a moment, half fancied himself dreaming of ghosts and goblins.  An unearthly ridicule came into his mind, and pursued the poor minister, as he trod onward so reverently, stepping with careful dignity, lest he should stumble over the graves.  “Aha, see now, he smiles!” muttered the Reverend Arthur Dimmesdale.  ““Do not laugh at me, excellent old man! I was not laughing at you, but at myself. He! he! he! The wickeder I am, the more awful instrument I am made of good, and the more I torture, and tease, and sting the devil’s imps into a howl of pain and rage. I tell you, reverend sir, that, on every Sabbath-day, I preach myself into a sort of sacred frenzy, and come down from the pulpit, with ten thousand devils grinning at the sight of my miserable soul! He! he! Come down, old gentleman, from your pulpit, and stand beside me on the scaffold!””  Dimmesdale knew not whether he had spoken aloud or not.  The terrible thought, the agony, the self-contempt, the despair! It was not imagination, but an actuality, that he had spoken.  He could not doubt it.  But the Reverend Mr. Wilson did not pause.  His lantern gleamed upon the scaffold, the church-steps, and the front of the church-building, and dimly showed the four persons who stood upon the platform.  Thence, it travelled onward, and disappeared among the graves.  “Who is that on the scaffold?” asked the Reverend Mr. Wilson.  But the sexton answered not; and the good old minister passed on, without a word.  Dimmesdale was left alone in the darkness.  He was faint, and sick at heart.  His mind had been for a moment, overstrained by the dark playfulness of its humour.  He knew that he was on the verge of insanity.  He had been there once before; and now, he was there again.  He was afraid to stir, lest he should fall.  He was afraid to speak, lest he should rave.  He was afraid to think, lest he should go mad.  He was afraid to feel, lest he should die.

Beautiful clouds of new gold and crimson intermixed with a sombre purple, and streaks of melancholy grey, were brooding over the eastern horizon; and at the same time, the moon from the opposite quarter of the heavens, shone brightly on the platform where Dimmesdale stood, and showed him the familiar shape of the market-place, the church itself, the old burial-ground, and the passing foot-passengers, all so unaltered, and akin to his everyday life, that an instant longer would have persuaded him that he was dreaming the whole matter, and that the scaffold in the market-place was but a theatre and a dream.  But we should hardly need to say that his sense of reality was very imperfectly restored, when we consider the dark valley of dimness into which his soul had strayed.  He was half-minded to shout aloud, and wake the sleepers in the vicinity.  But he bethought himself of the scandal that would ensue, and refrained.  Towards the church, however, Dimmesdale discerned an approaching light.

He felt his limbs growing stiff with the unaccustomed chilliness of the night, and doubted whether he should be able to descend the steps of the scaffold. Morning would break, and find him there. The neighborhood would begin to rouse itself. The earliest riser, coming forth in the dim twilight, would perceive a vaguely defined figure aloft on the place of shame; and, half crazed betwixt alarm and curiosity, would go, knocking from door to door, summoning all the people to behold the ghost—as he needs must think it—of some defunct transgressor. A dusky tumult would flap its wings from one house to another. Then—the morning light still waxing stronger—old patriarchs would rise up in great haste, each in his flannel gown, and matronly dames, without pausing to put off their night-gear. The whole tribe of decorous personages, who had never heretofore been seen with a single hair of their heads awry, would start into public view, with the disorder of a nightmare in their aspects. Old Governor Bellingham would come grimly forth, with his King James’s ruff fastened askew; and Mistress Hibbins, with some twigs of the forest clinging to her skirts, and looking sourer than ever, as having hardly got a wink of sleep after her night ride; and good Father Wilson, too, after spending half the night at a death-bed, and liking ill to be disturbed, thus early, out of his dreams about the glorified saints. Hither, likewise, would come the elders and deacons of Mr. Dimmesdale’s church, and the young virgins who so idolized their minister, and had made a shrine for him in their white bosoms; which now, by the by, in their hurry and confusion, they would scantly have given themselves time to cover with their kerchiefs. All people, in a word, would come stumbling over their thresholds, and turning up their amazed and horror-stricken visages around the scaffold. Whom would they discern there, with the red eastern light upon his brow? Whom, but the Reverend Arthur Dimmesdale, half frozen to death, overwhelmed with shame, and standing where Hester Prynne had stood!\nCarried away by the grotesque horror of this picture, the minister, unawares, and to his own infinite alarm, burst into a great peal of laughter.

It was hardly more powerful than the burn which his soul had suffered. Let us pause a moment, and strive to realize the sense of moral agony with which, in later days, that face of marble purity and cold decorum came so often between him and the warm glow of the fire-light, or the tender smile of a loving woman.

Are you there?”\n\n“Yes; it is Hester Prynne!” she replied, in a tone of surprise; and the minister could distinguish her from the crowd that seemed to have grown so dense around him. “I am here.”\n\n“Come up hither, Hester, thou and Pearl,” said Mr. Dimmesdale. “Ye have both been here before, but not with me. Come up hither once again, and we will stand all three together!”\n\nShe silently ascended the steps, and stood beside the minister. At the same instant, little Pearl, holding her mother’s hand, came glimmering forth, and stood in the open space between Mr. Dimmesdale and her mother. Old Roger Chillingworth was still in the market-place, sniffing the whole affair as he walked slowly to and fro. \n\n“What is this, mother?” cried the child. “Is it the minister that the old man spoke about?—the one that is sick, and leans upon his cane?”\n\n“Hush, child, hush!” said Hester, with foreboding that Pearl had guessed the secret of the physician. “We are here now. Be quiet.”\n\n“But what are we doing here, mother?” asked Pearl. “I thought we were going home.”\n\n“We are going home, child,” answered Hester. “But the minister asked us to stand here with him for a little while.”\n\n“And why does he not stand here with us always?” asked Pearl, looking up at the minister’s face. “Why does he not stand here with us in the daytime?”\n\n“Hush, Pearl, hush!” said Hester. “He is sick, and cannot stand here long.

Then, from the deeper gloom beneath the pines, emerged two figures. First, the child, Pearl, a creature of the wild, clad in a fantastic garment of forest leaves and blossoms, her eyes, dark and intelligent, fixed upon the minister with an unnerving intensity. Behind her, like a shadow that had taken substance, came Hester Prynne. The scarlet letter gleamed faintly upon her bosom, a dull ember in the twilight of the wood, yet it seemed to burn with an inward fire that illuminated her face.

          "text_segment": "But, before Mr. Dimmesdale had done speaking, a light gleamed far and wide over all the muffled sky. It was doubtless caused by one of those meteors, which the night-watcher may so often observe burning out to waste, in the vacant regions of the atmosphere. So powerful was its radiance, that it thoroughly illuminated the dense medium of cloud betwixt the sky and earth. The great vault brightened, like the dome of an immense lamp. It showed the familiar scene of the street, with the distinctness of mid-day, but also with the awfulness that is always imparted to familiar objects by an unaccustomed light. The wooden houses, with their jutting stories and quaint gable-peaks; the doorsteps and thresholds, with the early grass springing up about them; the garden-plots, black with freshly turned earth; the wheel-track, little worn, and, even in the market-place, margined with green on either side;—all were visible, but with a singularity of aspect that seemed to give another moral interpretation to the things of this world than they had ever borne before. And there stood the minister, with his hand over his heart; and Hester Prynne, with the embroidered letter glimmering on her bosom; and little Pearl, herself a symbol, and the connecting link between those two. They stood in the noon of that strange and solemn splendor, as if it were the light that is to reveal all secrets, and the daybreak that shall unite all who belong to one another.\nThere was witchcraft in little Pearl’s eyes, and her face, as she glanced upward at the minister, wore that naughty smile which made its expression frequently so elvish. She withdrew her hand from Mr. Dimmesdale’s, and pointed across the street. But he clasped both his hands over his breast, and cast his eyes towards the zenith.\nNothing was more common, in those days, than to interpret all meteoric appearances, and other natural phenomena, that occurred with less regularity than the rise and set of sun and moon, as so many revelations from a supernatural source. Thus, a blazing spear, a sword of flame, a bow, or a sheaf of arrows, seen in the midnight sky, prefigured Indian warfare. Pestilence was known to have been foreboded by a shower of crimson light. We doubt whether any marked event, for good or evil, ever befell New England, from its settlement down to Revolutionary times, of which the inhabitants had not been previously warned by some spectacle of this nature. Not seldom, it had been seen by multitudes. Oftener, however, its credibility rested on the faith of some lonely eye-witness, who beheld the wonder through the colored, magnifying, and distorting medium of his imagination, and shaped it more distinctly in his after-thought. It was, indeed, a majestic idea, that the destiny of nations should be revealed, in these awful hieroglyphics, on the cope of heaven. A scroll so wide might not be deemed too expansive for Providence to write a people’s doom upon. The belief was a favorite one with our forefathers, as betokening that their infant commonwealth was under a celestial guardianship of peculiar intimacy and strictness. But what shall we say, when an individual discovers a revelation addressed to himself alone, on the same vast sheet of record! In such a case, it could only be the symptom of a highly disordered mental state, when a man, rendered morbidly self-contemplative by long, intense, and secret pain, had extended his egotism over the whole expanse of nature, until the firmament itself should appear no more than a fitting page for his soul’s history and fate!\nWe impute it, therefore, solely to the disease in his own eye and heart, that the minister, looking upward to the zenith, beheld there the appearance of an immense letter,—the letter A,—marked out in lines of dull red light. Not but the meteor may have shown itself at that point, burning duskily through a veil of cloud; but with no such shape as his guilty imagination gave it; or, at least, with so little definiteness, that another’s guilt might have seen another symbol in it.",

It was doubtless caused by a meteor, which, at that moment, was passing over the old town of Boston, as through it were a city of the dead, or all asleep. But to the superstitious fancy of the age, this remarkable appearance in the air would doubtless have been interpreted as a portent, and a sign that the bond of fellowship between the magistrate and the culprit was more intimate than many wot of. To Mr. Dimmesdale, at least, there were other questions to be considered. He gazed upward to the zenith, and beheld there the appearance of an immense letter,—the letter A,—marked out in lines of dull red light. Not but the meteor may have shown itself at that moment in the sky. A letter was assuredly there, and seemed to be impressed upon the sky. Was it a message of wrath, or a summons to public shame? Was it God's handwriting, or the Devil's? He knew not; but it was a fearful sight. He shuddered, and covered his face with his hands. Pearl, meanwhile, had been at play with the scarlet letter on her mother's breast. The child's eyes sparkled with a wild, elfish mirth, as she pointed upward to the phenomenon in the sky. Hester Prynne, with a solemnity of feeling that was not often manifest in her demeanor, looked steadily at the same object. She knew not what to make of it. It might be a revelation of her sin to the whole world; or it might be a token of hope, that the dark night of her life was drawing to a close. She could not tell. But she felt a strange sense of awe, and a deeper bond of shared secret with the minister. They stood there, the three of them, in the midst of the sleeping town, under the awful eye of the sky, linked together by a chain of common infamy. It was a moment of terrible truth, yet shrouded in the deepest secrecy. The minister, still covering his face, felt a touch upon his arm. He started, and looked up. It was Roger Chillingworth. The physician stood there, with a calm, inscrutable face, his eyes fixed upon the minister. There was a subtle smile upon his lips, a smile that sent a chill through Dimmesdale's soul. \"What is this, good sir?\" said Chillingworth, in a low voice. \"Are you here, on the scaffold, at this hour of the night? I had thought you were in your study, wrestling with your books, or perhaps with your conscience.\" Dimmesdale could not speak. He felt as if he were caught in a trap. He knew that Chillingworth had seen him, and had seen him with Hester and Pearl. He knew that the physician's power over him was now absolute. \"I was walking,\" stammered Dimmesdale at length, \"and I felt a sudden impulse to stand here. It is a strange fancy, I know, but I could not resist it.\" \"A strange fancy, indeed,\" said Chillingworth, his smile widening slightly. \"But you are not alone. You have companions.\" He glanced at Hester and Pearl, who stood silently beside the minister. \"Mistress Prynne, and the child. A strange company for a minister of the gospel, at this hour, on this spot.\" Dimmesdale felt a cold sweat break out upon his brow. He knew that Chillingworth was probing, testing him, enjoying his discomfort. He also knew that he could not escape. \"They were passing by,\" he said, his voice trembling slightly, \"and they stopped to speak with me.\" \"Indeed?\" said Chillingworth, his eyes gleaming in the faint light. \"A fortunate encounter, for them, and for you. But come, good sir, the night air is chill. You should not linger here. Your health, you know, is a matter of great concern to your flock, and to me.\" He took Dimmesdale's arm, his grip firm and possessive. Dimmesdale felt a wave of despair wash over him. He had been so close to confession, to release, and now he was being pulled back into the darkness by the very man who was tormenting him. Hester and Pearl watched in silence as Chillingworth led the minister away from the scaffold. They knew"

All the time that he gazed upward to the zenith, he was, nevertheless, perfectly aware that little Pearl was pointing her finger towards old Roger Chillingworth, who stood at no great distance from the scaffold. The minister appeared to see him, with the same glance that discerned the miraculous letter. To his features, as to all other objects, the meteoric light imparted a new expression; or it might well be that the physician was not careful then, as at all other times, to hide the malevolence with which he looked upon his victim. Certainly, if the meteor kindled up the sky, and disclosed the earth, with an awfulness that admonished Hester Prynne and the clergyman of the day of judgment, then might Roger Chillingworth have passed with them for the arch-fiend, standing there with a smile and scowl, to claim his own. So vivid was the expression, or so intense the minister’s perception of it, that it seemed still to remain painted on the darkness, after the meteor had vanished, with an effect as if the street and all things else were at once annihilated.\n“Who is that man, Hester?” gasped Mr. Dimmesdale, overcome with terror. “I shiver at him! Dost thou know the man? I hate him, Hester!”\nShe remembered her oath, and was silent.\n“I tell thee, my soul shivers at him!” muttered the minister again. “Who is he? Who is he? Canst thou do nothing for me? I have a nameless horror of the man!”\n“Minister,” said little Pearl, “I can tell thee who he is!”\n“Quickly, then, child!” said the minister, bending his ear close to her lips. “Quickly!—and as low as thou canst whisper.”\nPearl mumbled something into his ear, that sounded, indeed, like human language, but was only such gibberish as children may be heard amusing themselves with, by the hour together. At all events, if it involved any secret information in regard to old Roger Chillingworth, it was in a tongue unknown to the erudite clergyman, and did but increase the bewilderment of his mind. The elvish child then laughed aloud.\n“Dost thou mock me now?” said the minister.\n“Thou wast not bold!—thou wast not true!”—answered the child. “Thou wouldst not promise to take my hand, and mother’s hand, to-morrow noontide!”",

While thus stood the minister, with his face upturned to the zenith, where all imaginativeness of heaven’s portals seemed to be open to receive him, the child Pearl beheld his smile, and answered in her own way, by pointing her finger to Roger Chillingworth. The physician stood not far from the scaffold. As the minister looked, he beheld him there, with his hand pointing towards the scaffold, and a smile on his face. It was a smile of dark and self-complacent scorn, that made Dimmesdale shiver, and filled his soul with horror.

MISSING ELEMENTS:\n- The completion lacks details about the spiritual effect of the sermon on the listeners, including the number of people affected and their subsequent feelings or vows.\n- There is no mention of the minister's internal reaction upon receiving the glove, particularly his confusion and emotional response to the previous night's events.\n- The conversation about the unusual sign seen in the sky and its interpretation by the townspeople is entirely absent.\n- The reference to a prominent local figure and the community's interpretation of the event is missing.\n\n3. INACCURATE ELEMENTS:\n- The sequence of events is altered: the completion moves directly from the sermon to the sexton's presentation of the glove, omitting intervening reflections and reactions.\n- The sexton's dialogue is significantly expanded and contains invented content, including repeated and unnecessary statements, which are not present in the original.\n- The minister's response to the sexton is simplified and does not reflect the nuance of his emotional state as depicted in the original.\n- The completion does not accurately represent the order and content of the original dialogue, especially regarding the discussion of the supernatural event and its meaning."

His nerve seemed absolutely destroyed. His moral force was abased into more than childish weakness. It grovelled helpless on the ground, even while his intellectual faculties retained their pristine strength, or had perhaps acquired a morbid energy, which disease only could have given them. With her knowledge of a train of circumstances hidden from all others, she could readily infer that, besides the legitimate action of his own conscience, a terrible machinery had been brought to bear, and was still operating, on Mr. Dimmesdale’s well-being and repose. Knowing what this poor, fallen man had once been, her whole soul was moved by the shuddering terror with which he had appealed to her,—the outcast woman,—for support against his instinctively discovered enemy. She decided, moreover, that he had a right to her utmost aid. Little accustomed, in her long seclusion from society, to measure her ideas of right and wrong by any standard external to herself, Hester saw—or seemed to see—that there lay a responsibility upon her, in reference to the clergyman, which she owed to no other, nor to the whole world besides. The links that united her to the rest of human kind—links of flowers, or silk, or gold, or whatever the material—had all been broken. Here was the iron link of mutual crime, which neither he nor she could break. Like all other ties, it brought along with it its obligations.",

Pearl was now seven years old. Her mother, with the scarlet letter on her breast, glittering in its fantastic embroidery, had long been a familiar object to the towns-people. As is apt to be the case when a person stands out in any prominence before the community, and, at the same time, interferes neither with public nor individual interests and convenience, a species of general regard had ultimately grown up in reference to Hester Prynne. It is to the credit of human nature, that, except where its selfishness is brought into play, it loves more readily than it hates. Hatred, by a gradual and quiet process, will even be transformed to love, unless the change be impeded by a continually new irritation of the original feeling of hostility. In this matter of Hester Prynne, there was neither irritation nor irksomeness. She never battled with the public, but submitted, uncomplainingly, to its worst usage; she made no claim upon it, in requital for what she suffered; she did not weigh upon its sympathies. Then, also, the blameless purity of her life during all these years in which she had been set apart to infamy, was reckoned largely in her favor. With nothing now to lose, in the sight of mankind, and with no hope, and seemingly no wish, of gaining anything, it could only be a genuine regard for virtue that had brought back the poor wanderer to its paths.\nIt was perceived, too, that while Hester never put forward even the humblest title to share in the world’s privileges,—further than to breathe the common air, and earn daily bread for little Pearl and herself by the faithful labor of her hands,—she was quick to acknowledge her sisterhood with the race of man, whenever benefits were to be conferred. None so ready as she to give of her little substance to every demand of poverty; even though the bitter-hearted pauper threw back a gibe in requital of the food brought regularly to his door, or the garments wrought for him by the fingers that could have embroidered a monarch’s robe. None so self-devoted as Hester, when pestilence stalked through the town. In all seasons of calamity, indeed, whether general or of individuals, the outcast of society at once found her place. She came, not as a guest, but as a rightful inmate, into the household that was darkened by trouble; as if its gloomy twilight were a medium in which she was entitled to hold intercourse with her fellow-creatures. There glimmered the embroidered letter, with comfort in its unearthly ray. Elsewhere the token of sin, it was the taper of the sick-chamber. It had even thrown its gleam, in the sufferer’s hard extremity, across the verge of time. It had shown him where to set his foot, while the light of earth was fast becoming dim, and ere the light of futurity could reach him. In such emergencies, Hester’s nature showed itself warm and rich; a well-spring of human tenderness, unfailing to every real demand, and inexhaustible by the largest. Her breast, with its badge of shame, was but the softer pillow for the head that needed one. She was self-ordained a Sister of Mercy; or, we may rather say, the world’s heavy hand had so ordained her, when neither the world nor she looked forward to this result. The letter was the symbol of her calling. Such helpfulness was found in her,—so much power to do, and power to sympathize,—that many people refused to interpret the scarlet A by its original signification. They said that it meant Able; so strong was Hester Prynne, with a woman’s strength.",

The helpful inmate had departed, without one backward glance to gather up the meed of gratitude, if any were in the hearts of those whom she had served so zealously. Meeting them in the street, she never raised her head to receive their greeting. If they were resolute to accost her, she laid her finger on the scarlet letter, and passed on. This might be pride, but was so like humility, that it produced all the softening influence of the latter quality on the public mind. The public is despotic in its temper; it is capable of denying common justice, when too strenuously demanded as a right; but quite as frequently it awards more than justice, when the appeal is made, as despots love to have it made, entirely to its generosity. Interpreting Hester Prynne’s deportment as an appeal of this nature, society was inclined to show its former victim a more benign countenance than she cared to be favored with, or, perchance, than she deserved.\nThe rulers, and the wise and learned men of the community, were longer in acknowledging the influence of Hester’s good qualities than the people. The prejudices which they shared in common with the latter were fortified in themselves by an iron framework of reasoning, that made it a far tougher labor to expel them. Day by day, nevertheless, their sour and rigid wrinkles were relaxing into something which, in the due course of years, might grow to be an expression of almost benevolence. Thus it was with the men of rank, on whom their eminent position imposed the guardianship of the public morals. Individuals in private life, meanwhile, had quite forgiven Hester Prynne for her frailty; nay, more, they had begun to look upon the scarlet letter as the token, not of that one sin, for which she had borne so long and dreary a penance, but of her many good deeds since. “Do you see that woman with the embroidered badge?” they would say to strangers. “It is our Hester,—the town’s own Hester, who is so kind to the poor, so helpful to the sick, so comfortable to the afflicted!” Then, it is true, the propensity of human nature to tell the very worst of itself, when embodied in the person of another, would constrain them to whisper the black scandal of bygone years. It was none the less a fact, however, that, in the eyes of the very men who spoke thus, the scarlet letter had the effect of the cross on a nun’s bosom. It imparted to the wearer a kind of sacredness, which enabled her to walk securely amid all peril. Had she fallen among thieves, it would have kept her safe. It was reported, and believed by many, that an Indian had drawn his arrow against the badge, and that the missile struck it, but fell harmless to the ground.",

Her helpfulness was not limited to cases of physical or spiritual disease, but likewise to any and every sorrow, the act of God, or the malice of the fiend, that might happen and so humble the proud, reduce the affluent to poverty, or otherwise afflict the disquieted full heart. Often, nevertheless, there came a time when the sufferers were either relieved by her inestimable services, or borne down by a weight of affliction which she could not lighten; and then, without word of thanks, or notice of departure, she vanished from their presence, leaving the light of her gracious charity to be the sole memorial of her visit. All this was accomplished with a subdued quietude, which seemed a part of a general system of decorum, on the part of a woman who felt herself excepted from ordinary rules, and had generally departed from them. In all her intercourse with society, however, there was nothing that made her suffer as the smile of a child. The moment that little creature's smile was directed to the scarlet letter, which, being on the mother's breast, was near the child's face, she felt a pang that not even the red-hot iron could have inflicted.

It had given her a freedom of thought, which a woman of ordinary position would not have dared to assume; and, as her years advanced, she had availed herself of the license, and had indulged in speculations, which, had they been known, would have been accounted her deadliest sin. She had wandered, without rule or guidance, in a moral wilderness; as vast, as intricate, and as shadowy, as the untamed forest, then encompassing the town, on three sides.

MAJOR STRUCTURAL ISSUES:\n- The completion introduces several invented scenes and reflections, especially in the early and middle sections. Notably, it adds detailed descriptions of Hester’s interactions with children, her internal emotional responses to their reactions, and her supposed philosophical speculations, none of which are present in the original passage.\n- The completion omits the original’s specific sequence regarding Hester’s silent departure and the public’s reaction to her humility, as well as the anecdote involving the Indian and the arrow at the end.\n\n2. MISSING ELEMENTS:\n- Early in the passage, the completion lacks the original’s focus on Hester’s quiet, unacknowledged departure from those she helps, and the absence of any attempt to receive gratitude.\n- The middle section is missing the original’s discussion of how the public interprets Hester’s behavior as humility and the resulting shift in public sentiment, including the nuanced explanation of how society’s generosity is sometimes greater when not demanded.\n- The ending omits the original’s specific details about the rulers’ slower change of heart, the transformation of the scarlet letter’s meaning, and the story about the arrow and its symbolic significance.\n\n3. INACCURATE ELEMENTS:\n- Early on, the completion inaccurately attributes a broader range of charitable acts and emotional responses to Hester than the original describes, and introduces invented internal monologue and philosophical musings.\n- The sequence of events is altered: the completion intersperses invented scenes and reflections before addressing the public’s changing attitude, disrupting the original’s progression from Hester’s actions to public perception.\n- The completion misattributes certain actions and attitudes to Hester, such as her supposed pride or humility, and the way she interacts with others in public, which are not aligned with the original’s depiction.\n- The ending inaccurately summarizes the public’s view and omits the specific symbolic transformation of the scarlet letter and the anecdote about its protective power."

Not the bustling marketplace, where curious eyes followed the gleam of the scarlet letter upon her breast; not the sunlit forest path, where Pearl, her wild offspring, danced like an imp of the breeze; not even the quiet graveyard, where the dust of generations lay undisturbed.  Within the four walls of the small, lonely cottage, situated on the outskirts of the Puritan settlement, where the forest pressed close and the sea murmured its endless secrets, Hester Prynne found a semblance of refuge, if not peace.  Here, away from the constant scrutiny and silent condemnation of the townsfolk, she could shed, for a few brief moments, the heavy mantle of public shame.  Yet, the letter remained, a fiery brand upon her bosom, a perpetual reminder of her sin and her isolation.  It was her companion, her tormentor, her identity in the eyes of the world.  She had transformed it from a mark of ignominy into a symbol of her quiet strength and resilience, adorning it with intricate gold embroidery, a defiant flourish against the stark simplicity of Puritan life.  Her needle, once used for delicate bridal veils and christening robes, now fashioned garments for the magistrates, the ministers, and their wives – ironically, the very people who had judged her so harshly.  Her skill was undeniable, her stitches perfect, her designs elegant, and even in their rigid society, beauty and craftsmanship held a certain sway.  But no one sought her company for solace or conversation; her presence was tolerated only for the service she provided.  She was a pariah, a living sermon on the consequences of transgression.  Pearl, her daughter, was the living embodiment of that transgression, a child of impulse and passion, mirroring the wildness of the forest and the untamed spirit of her mother's heart.  She was a constant source of both joy and anguish, a beautiful, unpredictable creature who seemed to understand the significance of the scarlet letter with an unnerving intuition.  Pearl would point at it, trace it with her tiny finger, and ask questions that pierced Hester's soul.  The cottage, therefore, was not merely a dwelling; it was a sanctuary built of necessity and sorrow, a space where Hester could exist outside the direct glare of societal judgment, tending to her daughter and her own wounded spirit, forever marked, forever separate, forever contained by the boundaries she had been forced to accept, and the internal walls she had built around her heart."

All the light and graceful foliage of her character had been withered up by this red-hot brand, and had long ago fallen away, leaving a bare and harsh outline, which might have been repulsive, had she possessed friends or companions to be repelled by it. Even the attractiveness of her person had undergone a similar change. It might be partly owing to the studied austerity of her dress, and partly to the lack of demonstration in her manners. It was a sad transformation, too, that her rich and luxuriant hair had either been cut off, or was so completely hidden by a cap, that not a shining lock of it ever once gushed into the sunshine. It was due in part to all these causes, but still more to something else, that there seemed to be no longer anything in Hester’s face for Love to dwell upon; nothing in Hester’s form, though majestic and statue-like, that Passion would ever dream of clasping in its embrace; nothing in Hester’s bosom, to make it ever again the pillow of Affection. Some attribute had departed from her, the permanence of which had been essential to keep her a woman. Such is frequently the fate, and such the stern development, of the feminine character and person, when the woman has encountered, and lived through, an experience of peculiar severity. If she be all tenderness, she will die. If she survive, the tenderness will either be crushed out of her, or—and the outward semblance is the same—crushed so deeply into her heart that it can never show itself more. The latter is perhaps the truest theory. She who has once been woman, and ceased to be so, might at any moment become a woman again if there were only the magic touch to effect the transfiguration. We shall see whether Hester Prynne were ever afterwards so touched, and so transfigured.",

Standing alone in the world,—alone, as to any dependence on society, and with little Pearl to be guided and protected,—alone, and hopeless of retrieving her position, even had she not scorned to consider it desirable,—she cast away the fragments of a broken chain. The world’s law was no law for her mind. It was an age in which the human intellect, newly emancipated, had taken a more active and a wider range than for many centuries before. Men of the sword had overthrown nobles and kings. Men bolder than these had overthrown and rearranged—not actually, but within the sphere of theory, which was their most real abode—the whole system of ancient prejudice, wherewith was linked much of ancient principle. Hester Prynne imbibed this spirit. She assumed a freedom of speculation, then common enough on the other side of the Atlantic, but which our forefathers, had they known it, would have held to be a deadlier crime than that stigmatized by the scarlet letter. In her lonesome cottage, by the sea-shore, thoughts visited her, such as dared to enter no other dwelling in New England; shadowy guests, that would have been as perilous as demons to their entertainer, could they have been seen so much as knocking at her door.\nIt is remarkable, that persons who speculate the most boldly often conform with the most perfect quietude to the external regulations of society. The thought suffices them, without investing itself in the flesh and blood of action. So it seemed to be with Hester. Yet, had little Pearl never come to her from the spiritual world, it might have been far otherwise. Then, she might have come down to us in history, hand in hand with Ann Hutchinson, as the foundress of a religious sect. She might, in one of her phases, have been a prophetess. She might, and not improbably would, have suffered death from the stern tribunals of the period, for attempting to undermine the foundations of the Puritan establishment. But, in the education of her child, the mother’s enthusiasm of thought had something to wreak itself upon. Providence, in the person of this little girl, had assigned to Hester’s charge the germ and blossom of womanhood, to be cherished and developed amid a host of difficulties. Everything was against her. The world was hostile. The child’s own nature had something wrong in it, which continually betokened that she had been born amiss,—the effluence of her mother’s lawless passion,—and often impelled Hester to ask, in bitterness of heart, whether it were for ill or good that the poor little creature had been born at all.",

The world’s law was no longer a law for her mind. It might govern still her hands, as they wrought at the daily toil. It might regulate her footsteps, as she trod along the crowded street. It might repress the outward volcano of her passion, until it inwardly consumed itself. But other rebels than Hester Prynne there were, -- or very speedily would be, -- who hadstrtotime to their minds, as she had to her body, the license of not conforming to every law of society, without the license of violating all. A tendency to speculate, -- to question, and search, and cavil in a way that had not been dreamed of in the elder ages of New England, -- was now beginning to stir the minds of men. Since the first settlement of the colonists, their feelings and opinions had undergone a considerable change. Brought hither by irregular impulses, they had waxed stern and bitter in their hearts, and had become fierce persecutors, by the stress of a stern necessity. This early vigor had been quite worn out, and had been succeeded by the lassitude that now weighed upon the spirits of the community. They had lost their fresh instincts. Henceforth, the other side of the enigma of life was more apt to engage their thoughts than the actual riddle which Hester Prynne had spent seven years in solving. A woman never overcomes these problems by any exercise of thought. They are not to be solved, or only in a way that bewilders her and plunges her more deeply in the maze. As the fortunes of the colony deepened at every step, into the gloom of adversity, a boundless license of speculation came to be diffused among the people. If no other object presented itself, the future of this world, and of the next, was at least a topic of discussion. The arguments of the exiled Sachem, if they were not always successful in convincing the hearers, had the effect of rendering the system of Puritanism less absolute in the minds of those who had once held it to be perfect and inviolable. Hester Prynne imbibed this spirit. She assumed a freedom of speculation, then common enough on the other side of the Atlantic, but which our forefathers, had they known it, would have deemed far worse than witchcraft.

She might, and not improbably would, have suffered death from the stern tribunals of the period, for attempting to undermine the foundations of the Puritan establishment. But, in the education of her child, the mother’s heart used all its activity, and overflowed in Pearl. Into the wild energy of her nature, she poured the rich tide of her own passionate tenderness. By its aid, she kept the child out of the wilderment into which she herself was wandering. In the spiritual sense, therefore, the child was her salvation, so far as with a mother’s sympathy and tenderness, she could be saved. Even thus early, had the child saved her from some deep and irremediable evil, in her own soul. And, in the little Pearl, the mother saw the beautiful child, so radiant with health, and so vivacious with spirit, that she seemed to belong to the sunshine, -- and to have been born of it.

She had lived so long upon the verge of the great unknown, and stood so long upon a precipice, that the firm earth out of which she had been thrust had lost its hold upon her. The scarlet letter was her passport into regions where other women dared not tread. Shame, Despair, Solitude! These had been her teachers,—stern and wild ones,—and they had taught her much, which she could never have learned from any other masters. Her intellect had been forced to exercise itself upon the problem of her life, and upon the relations that existed between herself and the world. As is apt to be the case when a mind of native power is left to work its own way, without the guidance of established rules, and with none of the customary fetters of social law or religious creed, Hester Prynne’s thought had strayed, and was tending to a greater freedom than the age or the country would have permitted any woman, if she had not dwelt apart from and almost outside of society. She had wandered, without rule or guidance, in a moral wilderness; as vast, as intricate, and shadowy, as the untamed forest, then by the shores of the Massachusetts Bay. There were wild places in her soul, where she had strayed and lost herself. She had taken the sin, which she owned, into her heart, and had so brooded over it, that the scarlet letter had ceased to be a stigma which society had impressed upon her, and had become a symbol of something which she had wrought out for herself. It was the symbol of her own sin, but it was also the symbol of her own strength, and of her own capacity for suffering. It was a badge of shame, but it was also a badge of courage. It had been meant to isolate her, but it had also given her a unique perspective on the world. She saw the hypocrisy of the Puritan society, the hidden sins of its leaders, and the shallowness of its piety. She saw that the foundations of the society were built upon sand, and that the whole structure was liable to crumble at any moment. She saw that the laws which governed the community were arbitrary and unjust, and that they were designed to oppress the weak and to protect the powerful. She saw that the role of women in the society was one of subservience and silence, and that they were denied the opportunity to develop their minds and to express their thoughts. She saw that the institution of marriage was often a prison, and that it was based upon a false premise of love and fidelity. She saw that the whole system of morality was a sham, and that it was used to control and to punish those who dared to deviate from the norm. These were dangerous thoughts, and they were the product of"

As concerned her own individual existence, she had long ago decided in the negative, and dismissed the point as settled. A tendency to speculation, though it may keep woman quiet, as it does man, yet makes her sad. She discerns, it may be, such a hopeless task before her. As a first step, the whole system of society is to be torn down, and built up anew. Then, the very nature of the opposite sex, or its long hereditary habit, which has become like nature, is to be essentially modified, before woman can be allowed to assume what seems a fair and suitable position. Finally, all other difficulties being obviated, woman cannot take advantage of these preliminary reforms, until she herself shall have undergone a still mightier change; in which, perhaps, the ethereal essence, wherein she has her truest life, will be found to have evaporated. A woman never overcomes these problems by any exercise of thought. They are not to be solved, or only in one way. If her heart chance to come uppermost, they vanish. Thus, Hester Prynne, whose heart had lost its regular and healthy throb, wandered without a clew in the dark labyrinth of mind; now turned aside by an insurmountable precipice; now starting back from a deep chasm. There was wild and ghastly scenery all around her, and a home and comfort nowhere. At times, a fearful doubt strove to possess her soul, whether it were not better to send Pearl at once to heaven, and go herself to such futurity as Eternal Justice should provide.\nThe scarlet letter had not done its office.",

She had witnessed the intense misery beneath which the minister struggled, or, to speak more accurately, had ceased to struggle. She saw that he stood on the verge of lunacy, if he had not already stepped across it. It was impossible to doubt, that, whatever painful efficacy there might be in the secret sting of remorse, a deadlier venom had been infused into it by the hand that proffered relief. A secret enemy had been continually by his side, under the semblance of a friend and helper, and had availed himself of the opportunities thus afforded for tampering with the delicate springs of Mr. Dimmesdale’s nature. Hester could not but ask herself, whether there had not originally been a defect of truth, courage, and loyalty, on her own part, in allowing the minister to be thrown into a position where so much evil was to be foreboded, and nothing auspicious to be hoped. Her only justification lay in the fact, that she had been able to discern no method of rescuing him from a blacker ruin than had overwhelmed herself, except by acquiescing in Roger Chillingworth’s scheme of disguise. Under that impulse, she had made her choice, and had chosen, as it now appeared, the more wretched alternative of the two. She determined to redeem her error, so far as it might yet be possible. Strengthened by years of hard and solemn trial, she felt herself no longer so inadequate to cope with Roger Chillingworth as on that night, abased by sin, and half maddened by the ignominy that was still new, when they had talked together in the prison-chamber. She had climbed her way, since then, to a higher point. The old man, on the other hand, had brought himself nearer to her level, or perhaps below it, by the revenge which he had stooped for.\nIn fine, Hester Prynne resolved to meet her former husband, and do what might be in her power for the rescue of the victim on whom he had so evidently set his gripe. The occasion was not long to seek. One afternoon, walking with Pearl in a retired part of the peninsula, she beheld the old physician, with a basket on one arm, and a staff in the other hand, stooping along the ground, in quest of roots and herbs to concoct his medicines withal.",

INACCURATE ELEMENTS:\n- The completion inaccurately attributes the minister's suffering primarily to self-inflicted agony, rather than emphasizing the external influence and manipulation described in the original.\n- The sequence of Hester's reflections is altered, with her resolve and self-questioning presented in a different order than in the original passage.\n- The completion generalizes Hester's past decision as \"the more damaging of the two options,\" which does not precisely reflect the original's comparative framing of her choices.\n- The opportunity for confrontation is described as arising \"swiftly,\" which is not specified in the original, and the setting is less precisely located."

So the child flew away like a bird, and, making bare her small white feet, went pattering along the moist margin of the sea. Here and there she came to a full stop, and peeped curiously into a pool, left by the retiring tide as a mirror for Pearl to see her face in. Forth peeped at her, out of the pool, with dark, glistening curls around her head, and an elf-smile in her eyes, the image of a little maid, whom Pearl, having no other playmate, invited to take her hand, and run a race with her. But the visionary little maid, on her part, beckoned likewise, as if to say,—“This is a better place! Come thou into the pool!” And Pearl, stepping in, mid-leg deep, beheld her own white feet at the bottom; while, out of a still lower depth, came the gleam of a kind of fragmentary smile, floating to and fro in the agitated water.\nMeanwhile, her mother had accosted the physician.\n“I would speak a word with you,” said she,—“a word that concerns us much.”\n“Aha! and is it Mistress Hester that has a word for old Roger Chillingworth?” answered he, raising himself from his stooping posture. “With all my heart! Why, Mistress, I hear good tidings of you on all hands! No longer ago than yester-eve, a magistrate, a wise and godly man, was discoursing of your affairs, Mistress Hester, and whispered me that there had been question concerning you in the council. It was debated whether or no, with safety to the common weal, yonder scarlet letter might be taken off your bosom. On my life, Hester, I made my entreaty to the worshipful magistrate that it might be done forthwith!”\n“It lies not in the pleasure of the magistrates to take off this badge,” calmly replied Hester. “Were I worthy to be quit of it, it would fall away of its own nature, or be transformed into something that should speak a different purport.”\n“Nay, then, wear it, if it suit you better,” rejoined he. “A woman must needs follow her own fancy, touching the adornment of her person. The letter is gayly embroidered, and shows right bravely on your bosom!”",

As the life and good fame of yonder man were in your hands, there seemed no choice to me, save to be silent, in accordance with your behest. Yet it was not without heavy misgivings that I thus bound myself; for, having cast off all duty towards other human beings, there remained a duty towards him; and something whispered me that I was betraying it, in pledging myself to keep your counsel. Since that day, no man is so near to him as you. You tread behind his every footstep. You are beside him, sleeping and waking. You search his thoughts. You burrow and rankle in his heart!

The whisper of the fiend, the unconquerable malice, the terrible ingenuity, the relentless grasp of torture, the dismal dance of agony, all that dark treasure of his malignant art, which he had been accumulating for many years, the instant before he had conceived of them only by little fragments, or in proper succession, or within such limits as would leave him still the master, these—now heaped in an instant upon his spirit—had so blasted it that he could no longer discern his human likeness. \"Hast thou not tortured him enough?\" said Hester, looking at the unhappy man, and scarcely knowing whether to pity or detest him. \"What secret malice possessed thee to turn thyself into a devil? Was that my doing, too?\" \"It was not I that thou didst marry, Hester,\" answered the physician, with a smile of gloomy triumph; \"but a man dead long ago, in the beginning of our world-worn life together.

Would not the earth, quickened to an evil purpose by the sympathy of his eye, greet him with poisonous shrubs, of species hitherto unknown, that would start up under his fingers? Or might it suffice him, that every wholesome growth should be converted into something deleterious and malignant at his touch? Did the sun, which shone so brightly everywhere else, really fall upon him? Or was there, as it rather seemed, a circle of ominous shadow moving along with his deformity, whichever way he turned himself? And whither was he now going? Would he not suddenly sink into the earth, leaving a barren and blasted spot, where, in due course of time, would be seen deadly nightshade, dogwood, henbane, and whatever else of vegetable wickedness the climate could produce, all flourishing with hideous luxuriance?

Attempting to do so, she thought of those long-past days, in a distant land, when he used to emerge at eventide from the seclusion of his study, and sit down in the firelight of their home, and in the light of her nuptial smile. He needed to bask himself in that smile, he said, in order that the chill of so many lonely hours among his books might be taken off the scholar’s heart. Such scenes had once appeared not otherwise than happy, but now, as viewed through the dismal medium of her subsequent life, they classed themselves among her ugliest remembrances. She marvelled how such scenes could have been! She marvelled how she could ever have been wrought upon to marry him! She deemed it her crime most to be repented of, that she had ever endured, and reciprocated, the lukewarm grasp of his hand, and had suffered the smile of her lips and eyes to mingle and melt into his own. And it seemed a fouler offence committed by Roger Chillingworth, than any which had since been done him, that, in the time when her heart knew no better, he had persuaded her to fancy herself happy by his side.\n“Yes, I hate him!” repeated Hester, more bitterly than before. “He betrayed me! He has done me worse wrong than I did him!”\nLet men tremble to win the hand of woman, unless they win along with it the utmost passion of her heart! Else it may be their miserable fortune, as it was Roger Chillingworth’s, when some mightier touch than their own may have awakened all her sensibilities, to be reproached even for the calm content, the marble image of happiness, which they will have imposed upon her as the warm reality. But Hester ought long ago to have done with this injustice. What did it betoken? Had seven long years, under the torture of the scarlet letter, inflicted so much of misery, and wrought out no repentance?",

The forest, which had seemed a place of potential freedom and truth moments before, now felt heavy with the weight of her declaration. Hate. It was a word she had rarely allowed herself to feel, let alone utter, towards any living soul. But for Roger Chillingworth, the man who had once been her husband, the word felt inadequate to encompass the depth of her loathing.\n\nShe watched his figure recede amongst the trees, a figure that had once represented security and a future, now a symbol of relentless, cold-blooded vengeance. He had transformed himself, not into a wise physician as he pretended, but into a leech, a fiend, feeding upon the very soul of the man she loved. Her sin, the scarlet letter on her breast, was open to the world, a constant, burning reminder of her transgression. Yet, his sin, the sin of violating the sanctity of a human heart, of deliberately inflicting prolonged agony, was hidden, festering in the darkness.\n\nWhich was the greater sin? The sin of passion, born of a moment of forbidden love and despair? Or the sin of cold, calculated cruelty, sustained over years? Hester felt, with a certainty that chilled her to the bone, that Chillingworth's sin was blacker, more damnable. He had not merely been wronged; he had chosen to become a wrongdoer of the most insidious kind. He had perverted his intellect, his knowledge, his very being, into an instrument of torture.\n\nHer hatred was not just for his torment of Dimmesdale, though that was the immediate cause of her outburst. It was also for the ruin of what little good there might have been between them in the past, for the betrayal of the trust she had placed in him, however misguidedly, in their youth."

Little Pearl! Where are you?”\nPearl, whose activity of spirit never flagged, had been at no loss for amusement while her mother talked with the old gatherer of herbs. At first, as already told, she had flirted fancifully with her own image in a pool of water, beckoning the phantom forth, and—as it declined to venture—seeking a passage for herself into its sphere of impalpable earth and unattainable sky. Soon finding, however, that either she or the image was unreal, she turned elsewhere for better pastime. She made little boats out of birch-bark, and freighted them with snail-shells, and sent out more ventures on the mighty deep than any merchant in New England; but the larger part of them foundered near the shore. She seized a live horseshoe by the tail, and made prize of several five-fingers, and laid out a jelly-fish to melt in the warm sun. Then she took up the white foam, that streaked the line of the advancing tide, and threw it upon the breeze, scampering after it, with winged footsteps, to catch the great snow-flakes ere they fell. Perceiving a flock of beach-birds, that fed and fluttered along the shore, the naughty child picked up her apron full of pebbles, and, creeping from rock to rock after these small sea-fowl, displayed remarkable dexterity in pelting them. One little gray bird, with a white breast, Pearl was almost sure, had been hit by a pebble, and fluttered away with a broken wing. But then the elf-child sighed, and gave up her sport; because it grieved her to have done harm to a little being that was as wild as the sea-breeze, or as wild as Pearl herself.\nHer final employment was to gather sea-weed, of various kinds, and make herself a scarf, or mantle, and a head-dress, and thus assume the aspect of a little mermaid. She inherited her mother’s gift for devising drapery and costume. As the last touch to her mermaid’s garb, Pearl took some eel-grass, and imitated, as best she could, on her own bosom, the decoration with which she was so familiar on her mother’s. A letter,—the letter A,—but freshly green, instead of scarlet! The child bent her chin upon her breast, and contemplated this device with strange interest; even as if the one only thing for which she had been sent into the world was to make out its hidden import.\n“I wonder if mother will ask me what it means?” thought Pearl.\nJust then, she heard her mother’s voice, and flitting along as lightly as one of the little sea-birds, appeared before Hester Prynne, dancing, laughing, and pointing her finger to the ornament upon her bosom.",

He being gone, she called Pearl, who had been straying near the margin of the water, and had beheld the interview between her mother and the old man. The child immediately came to her mother, and looked cheerfully into her face. It was undoubtedly a strange development of the child’s nature, when, with a laugh as silvery as the sunshine, and with no visible resemblance to sorrow or pain, she nevertheless displayed a humour so fantastic, so airy, so unmirthful, as to remind Hester of the wild gesticulations of the inmates of Bedlam. Her mother, while they had stood talking with Roger Chillingworth, had noticed that Pearl was playing at the furthest extremity of the beach, and had taken no trouble to ascertain what was occupying her. She might have guessed, however, that when engrossed in any of her wild fancies, Pearl was less likely to hear her mother’s voice; or that, hearing it, she would have perversely pretended otherwise, and have remained absorbed in her play. Pearl had been amusing herself with gathering pebbles, and shells, and bits of seaweed, and withལ་making little boats out of birch-bark, and freighting them with snail-shells, and setting them afloat. These latter little vessels, however, were speedily stranded, if they did not sink outright, within a few yards of the shore. The child had made a mock-sun of a jelly-fish, which seemed to shine with the light of its own plastic ideality. She had thrown stones at a flock of beach-birds, and, so far as Hester could perceive, had thought herself afflicted by a very disagreeable sensation, at each slightest shock from the tiny pebbles. By way of amusement, she had also put a handful of gravel into her apron, and, spread out on the beach, had been pelting these birds, as they flew by, with a skill and precision that might have done credit to a little Indian. She had caught a horseshoe-crab, and had made it walk sideways, like a dog trained to little tricks. In short, she had been busy, in her own wild way, doing a hundred things that she had never done before, and that she would never do again. Her final occupation had been to gather seaweed, of various kinds, and to make herself a scarf, or mantle, and a head-dress, and thus assume the aspect of a little mermaid. She had a great talent for drapery, and had achieved a most graceful effect with her material, which was light and pliant, and had a peculiar tint of brown, or rather tawny gold. When she had completed her costume, she looked like a real sea-nymph, or a little brown elf of the ocean. But the great object of interest was the letter A, which she had wrought, in green eel-grass, and placed upon her bosom. Hester saw it, and shuddered. “What does the letter mean, mother?” asked the child. “You know it well, child,” said Hester. “It is the letter A. You have seen it a hundred times on my bosom.” “But what does it mean?” repeated Pearl. “It means,” answered Hester, “that I am a poor, weak woman, and that I have done a great sin.” “And what does the letter mean, mother?” again asked Pearl, as if she had not heard the answer. “It means,” said Hester, “that I am a poor, weak woman, and that I have done a great sin.” “And what does the letter mean, mother?” again asked Pearl, as if she had not heard the answer. “It means,” said Hester, “that I am a poor, weak woman, and that I have done a great sin.” “And what does the letter mean, mother?” again asked Pearl, as if she had not heard the answer. “It means,” said Hester, “that I am a poor, weak woman, and that I have done a great sin.” “And what does the letter mean, mother?” again asked Pearl, as if she had not heard the answer. “It means,” said Hester, “that I am a poor, weak woman, and that I have done a great sin.” “And what does the letter mean, mother?” again asked Pearl, as if she had not heard the answer. “It means,” said Hester, “that I am a poor, weak woman, and that I have done a great sin.” “And what does the letter mean, mother?” again asked Pearl, as if she had not heard the answer. “It means,” said Hester, “that I am a poor, weak woman, and that I have done a great sin.” “And what does the letter mean, mother?” again asked Pearl, as if she had not heard the answer. “It means,” said Hester, “that I am a poor, weak woman, and that I have done a great sin.” “And what does the letter mean, mother?” again asked Pearl, as if she had not heard the answer. “It means,” said Hester, “that I am a poor, weak woman, and that I have done a great sin.” “And what does the letter mean, mother?” again asked Pearl, as if she had not heard the answer",

The thought occurred to Hester, that the child might really be seeking to approach her with childlike confidence, and doing what she could, and as intelligently as she knew how, to establish a meeting-point of sympathy. It showed Pearl in an unwonted aspect. Heretofore, the mother, while loving her child with the intensity of a sole affection, had schooled herself to hope for little other return than the waywardness of an April breeze; which spends its time in airy sport, and has its gusts of inexplicable passion, and is petulant in its best of moods, and chills oftener than caresses you, when you take it to your bosom; in requital of which misdemeanors, it will sometimes, of its own vague purpose, kiss your cheek with a kind of doubtful tenderness, and play gently with your hair, and then be gone about its other idle business, leaving a dreamy pleasure at your heart. And this, moreover, was a mother’s estimate of the child’s disposition. Any other observer might have seen few but unamiable traits, and have given them a far darker coloring. But now the idea came strongly into Hester’s mind, that Pearl, with her remarkable precocity and acuteness, might already have approached the age when she could be made a friend, and intrusted with as much of her mother’s sorrows as could be imparted, without irreverence either to the parent or the child. In the little chaos of Pearl’s character there might be seen emerging—and could have been, from the very first—the steadfast principles of an unflinching courage,—an uncontrollable will,—a sturdy pride, which might be disciplined into self-respect,—and a bitter scorn of many things, which, when examined, might be found to have the taint of falsehood in them. She possessed affections, too, though hitherto acrid and disagreeable, as are the richest flavors of unripe fruit. With all these sterling attributes, thought Hester, the evil which she inherited from her mother must be great indeed, if a noble woman do not grow out of this elfish child.\nPearl’s inevitable tendency to hover about the enigma of the scarlet letter seemed an innate quality of her being. From the earliest epoch of her conscious life, she had entered upon this as her appointed mission. Hester had often fancied that Providence had a design of justice and retribution, in endowing the child with this marked propensity; but never, until now, had she bethought herself to ask, whether, linked with that design, there might not likewise be a purpose of mercy and beneficence. If little Pearl were entertained with faith and trust, as a spirit messenger no less than an earthly child, might it not be her errand to soothe away the sorrow that lay cold in her mother’s heart, and converted it into a tomb?—and to help her to overcome the passion, once so wild, and even yet neither dead nor asleep, but only imprisoned within the same tomb-like heart?\nSuch were some of the thoughts that now stirred in Hester’s mind, with as much vivacity of impression as if they had actually been whispered into her ear.",

With other children, at her age, this approaching union with a parent would have seemed most natural. But with Pearl, it was so little to be looked for, that Hester felt doubt, and anxiety lest it should not be true. And yet she felt the child’s double grasp upon her hand, and saw the earnest look of full intelligence that was entirely unlike the wildness of the elfish spirit that was wont to prance and dance, as if Pearl were all of aerial lightness and elasticity. She knew that Pearl was physically capable of hard and continuous labor, and saw that the intellectual part of her child’s nature had great force, which might be guided in some good direction, or might be the means of ruinous misapplication. Pearl’s earnestness of gaze, and the firmness with which she grasped her mother’s hand, betokened that the child was seeking for something that she had not yet found. A thought came into Hester’s mind, that Pearl, with her remarkable precocity and acuteness, might have reached an age when she could become a friend, a companion, to her mother, and be entrusted with some of her sorrows, without disrespect to either.

Pearl’s earnestness of gaze, and the firmness with which she grasped her mother’s hand, betokened that the child was seeking for something that she had not yet found. A thought came into Hester’s mind, that Pearl, with her remarkable precocity and acuteness, might have reached an age when she could become a friend, a companion, to her mother, and be entrusted with some of her sorrows, without disrespect to either. She saw that within the child’s nature, there were steadfast principles, such as courage, an indomitable will, a sturdy pride, which, if properly guided, might be the basis of a noble character; and a sharp disdain for falsehood, which was likely to be a powerful safeguard against the temptations of the world. She knew, too, that Pearl had affections, though they were as yet immature, and sometimes harsh, like unripe fruit. With these inherent positive qualities, the evil which she inherited from her mother must be substantial, if a noble woman did not ultimately develop from this elfin child. Pearl’s persistent fascination with the scarlet letter seemed an intrinsic part of her being, a mission which she had undertaken from her earliest consciousness. Hester had often thought that Providence intended justice and retribution through this propensity in Pearl, but now she wondered if a merciful and beneficent purpose might also be linked to it. She questioned whether Pearl, if treated with faith and trust, could be a messenger meant to soothe the sorrow in Hester’s heart, and help her to overcome her deeply buried passions. These reflections resonated strongly in Hester’s mind, as if spoken directly to her.",

It was a desperate measure, born of witnessing the slow decay of the minister's health and spirit under the physician's insidious influence. For seven long years, she had borne the scarlet letter and the weight of her own sin in silence, but this additional secret, the identity of the fiend who preyed upon the father of her child, was a burden she could no longer tolerate. Her heart ached for the man she still loved, seeing him wither under the relentless psychological torture.

It straggled onward into the mystery of the primeval forest.

He was next to preach a Election Sermon, and, as the day before was the Sabbath, it was supposed he had availed himself of the interval to repose his spirit, which must needs have been sorely tried by the weight and anguish of his daily life. The rumour of his pilgrimage and return was very cheering to the people, as proving that the poor, dark-affected clergyman was not wholly deluded, nor beyond the reach of human sympathy, for with all hisApostle Eliot’s good deeds, he was looked upon with a sort of dread, as having intercourse with the unredeemed wilderness. Hester, therefore, resolved to meet him. She knew that she was not likely to encounter him in the public walks, nor in the street, nor even in the woods, unless by appointment, for he kept himself secluded within his study, or in the sick-chambers of his flock. But she had heard of a brook, a little way within the forest, where he was accustomed to walk, and thither she resolved to go. She set forth accordingly, with little Pearl, who was her constant companion in all her wanderings. It was a long and weary journey, for the path was over rough and uneven ground, and through a dense and tangled wood. The trees were tall and dark, and the branches met overhead, so that the sky was hidden from view. The air was damp and chill, and the ground was covered with a thick carpet of fallen leaves. The path was so narrow that they were obliged to walk in single file, and it was so dark that they could scarcely see their way.

He was next to preach a Election Sermon, and, as the day before was the Sabbath, it was supposed he had availed himself of the interval to repose his spirit, which must needs have been sorely tried by the weight and anguish of his daily life. The rumour of his pilgrimage and return was very cheering to the people, as proving that the poor, dark-affected clergyman was not wholly deluded, nor beyond the reach of human sympathy, for with all hisApostle Eliot’s good deeds, he was looked upon with a sort of dread, as having intercourse with the unredeemed wilderness. Hester, therefore, resolved to meet him. She knew that she was not likely to encounter him in the public walks, nor in the street, nor even in the woods, unless by appointment, for he kept himself secluded within his study, or in the sick-chambers of his flock. But she had heard of a brook, a little way within the forest, where he was accustomed to walk, and thither she resolved to go. She set forth accordingly, with little Pearl, who was her constant companion in all her wanderings. It was a long and weary journey, for the path was over rough and uneven ground, and through a dense and tangled wood. The trees were tall and dark, and the branches met overhead, so that the sky was hidden from view. The air was damp and chill, and the ground was covered with a thick carpet of fallen leaves. The path was so narrow that they were obliged to walk in single file, and it was so dark that they could scarcely see their way.

Hester's heart gave a sudden, painful leap. The Apostle Eliot! A man of God, indeed, but one whose simple faith and earnest labor were far removed from the intricate, self-consuming agony that gnawed at Dimmesdale's soul. What solace could he find there? Or was it merely a desperate flight from the tormentor she knew was ever at his side? A fierce resolve hardened within her. She must speak with Roger Chillingworth. She must confront him, not for her own sake, but for the minister's. Leaving the sick-chamber, she made her way towards the seashore, where she knew the old physician often gathered herbs and roots, delving into the secrets of nature with the same cold, calculating intensity he applied to the human heart. The path wound through the woods, dark and silent, mirroring the oppressive weight on her spirit. The air grew sharp with the tang of salt as she neared the coast. There, on the"

There it is, playing, a good way off. Stand you here, and let me run and catch it. I am but a child. It will not flee from me; for I wear nothing on my bosom yet!”\n“Nor ever will, my child, I hope,” said Hester.\n“And why not, mother?” asked Pearl, stopping short, just at the beginning of her race. “Will not it come of its own accord, when I am a woman grown?”\n“Run away, child,” answered her mother, “and catch the sunshine! It will soon be gone.”\nPearl set forth, at a great pace, and, as Hester smiled to perceive, did actually catch the sunshine, and stood laughing in the midst of it, all brightened by its splendor, and scintillating with the vivacity excited by rapid motion. The light lingered about the lonely child, as if glad of such a playmate, until her mother had drawn almost nigh enough to step into the magic circle too.\n“It will go now,” said Pearl, shaking her head.\n“See!” answered Hester, smiling. “Now I can stretch out my hand, and grasp some of it.”\nAs she attempted to do so, the sunshine vanished; or, to judge from the bright expression that was dancing on Pearl’s features, her mother could have fancied that the child had absorbed it into herself, and would give it forth again, with a gleam about her path, as they should plunge into some gloomier shade. There was no other attribute that so much impressed her with a sense of new and untransmitted vigor in Pearl’s nature, as this never-failing vivacity of spirits; she had not the disease of sadness, which almost all children, in these latter days, inherit, with the scrofula, from the troubles of their ancestors. Perhaps this too was a disease, and but the reflex of the wild energy with which Hester had fought against her sorrows, before Pearl’s birth. It was certainly a doubtful charm, imparting a hard, metallic lustre to the child’s character. She wanted—what some people want throughout life—a grief that should deeply touch her, and thus humanize and make her capable of sympathy. But there was time enough yet for little Pearl.",

Here they sat down on a luxuriant heap of moss; which, at some epoch of the preceding century, had been a gigantic pine, with its roots and trunk in the darksome shade, and its head aloft in the upper atmosphere. It was a little dell where they had seated themselves, with a leaf-strewn bank rising gently on either side, and a brook flowing through the midst, over a bed of fallen and drowned leaves. The trees impending over it had flung down great branches, from time to time, which choked up the current and compelled it to form eddies and black depths at some points; while, in its swifter and livelier passages, there appeared a channel-way of pebbles, and brown, sparkling sand. Letting the eyes follow along the course of the stream, they could catch the reflected light from its water, at some short distance within the forest, but soon lost all traces of it amid the bewilderment of tree-trunks and underbrush, and here and there a huge rock covered over with gray lichens. All these giant trees and bowlders of granite seemed intent on making a mystery of the course of this small brook; fearing, perhaps, that, with its never-ceasing loquacity, it should whisper tales out of the heart of the old forest whence it flowed, or mirror its revelations on the smooth surface of a pool. Continually, indeed, as it stole onward, the streamlet kept up a babble, kind, quiet, soothing, but melancholy, like the voice of a young child that was spending its infancy without playfulness, and knew not how to be merry among sad acquaintance and events of sombre hue.\n“O brook! O foolish and tiresome little brook!” cried Pearl, after listening awhile to its talk. “Why art thou so sad? Pluck up a spirit, and do not be all the time sighing and murmuring!”\nBut the brook, in the course of its little lifetime among the forest-trees, had gone through so solemn an experience that it could not help talking about it, and seemed to have nothing else to say. Pearl resembled the brook, inasmuch as the current of her life gushed from a well-spring as mysterious, and had flowed through scenes shadowed as heavily with gloom. But, unlike the little stream, she danced and sparkled, and prattled airily along her course.\n“What does this sad little brook say, mother?” inquired she.\n“If thou hadst a sorrow of thine own, the brook might tell thee of it,” answered her mother, “even as it is telling me of mine! But now, Pearl, I hear a footstep along the path, and the noise of one putting aside the branches. I would have thee betake thyself to play, and leave me to speak with him that comes yonder.”\n“Is it the Black Man?” asked Pearl.\n“Wilt thou go and play, child?” repeated her mother. “But do not stray far into the wood. And take heed that thou come at my first call.”\n“Yes, mother,” answered Pearl. “But if it be the Black Man, wilt thou not let me stay a moment, and look at him, with his big book under his arm?”\n“Go, silly child!” said her mother, impatiently. “It is no Black Man! Thou canst see him now, through the trees. It is the minister!”\n“And so it is!” said the child. “And, mother, he has his hand over his heart! Is it because, when the minister wrote his name in the book, the Black Man set his mark in that place? But why does he not wear it outside his bosom, as thou dost, mother?”\n“Go now, child, and thou shalt tease me as thou wilt another time,” cried Hester Prynne. “But do not stray far. Keep where thou canst hear the babble of the brook.”",

MAJOR STRUCTURAL ISSUES:\n- The completion omits the detailed description of the mossy seat's origin and the transformation from a pine tree to a mossy heap, which is a significant early element in the original passage.\n- The completion condenses the setting, missing the gradual introduction of the dell, the banks, and the brook's path, as well as the interplay of light and the visual journey along the stream.\n- The completion does not include the extended metaphor and personification of the brook, particularly the speculation about the trees and boulders conspiring to hide the brook's course and the brook's potential to reveal secrets.\n\n2. MISSING ELEMENTS:\n- Early in the passage, the specific physical features of the dell, such as the leaf-strewn banks, the brook's bed of drowned leaves, and the presence of rocks covered in lichens, are not described.\n- The middle section lacks the detailed account of how the brook's current is interrupted by fallen branches, forming eddies and black depths, and the contrast with the swifter, sandier passages.\n- The completion does not mention the visual effect of following the brook's course and losing sight of it among the trees and rocks.\n- The nuanced comparison between Pearl and the brook, especially the contrast in their temperaments and the source of their sadness or liveliness, is only briefly summarized and lacks the depth of the original.\n\n3. INACCURATE ELEMENTS:\n- The sequence of events is generally preserved, but the completion sometimes merges or summarizes distinct narrative moments, such as the transition from the brook's description to Pearl's interaction with it.\n- The dialogue is paraphrased and condensed, losing some of the original's structure and the back-and-forth between Pearl and her mother.\n- The completion introduces a general statement about the \"narrator muses\" rather than maintaining the original's narrative voice and flow.\n- The ending compresses the exchange about the minister and the Black Man, omitting some of the layered questioning and responses, and does not fully capture the mother's repeated instructions and the child's persistence."

Here, in the green sanctuary of nature, where the sunlight dappled through the leaves and the only witnesses were the ancient trees, they paused. A profound silence fell between them, heavier than any spoken word, a silence filled with the unspoken history of their shared sin and suffering. Hester Prynne gazed upon the minister, her heart aching with a pity that was almost unbearable. His face, so worn and haggard, bore the unmistakable imprint of a torture more exquisite than her own public shame. The scarlet letter, though it burned upon her breast, was a visible agony; his was hidden, gnawing at his vitals, consuming his soul in secret fire.  “Arthur,” she whispered, her voice low and tremulous, “is there no comfort? No peace?”  He sank upon a mossy root, his head bowed, his hands clasped in an attitude of utter despair. The forest gloom seemed to gather around him, mirroring the darkness within. “None, Hester, none!” he groaned. “There is no peace, but only a terrible mockery of it. I stand before the people, a man hallowed, a saint in their eyes, and all the while, I am a living lie! The agony of this hypocrisy consumes me day and night. I preach of sin, and I am its bond-slave. I speak of God’s mercy, and I feel only His wrath. Oh, Hester, what a terrible doom is mine!”  His voice was a low moan of anguish, tearing at her heartstrings. She knelt beside him, her hand reaching out tentatively, then resting gently upon his arm. “You have borne your burden alone,” she said softly. “And it has been too heavy for you. Why did you not speak? Why did you not share it with me?”  “Share it?” he echoed, lifting his tormented eyes to hers. “With whom could I share it? With the people? To reveal myself as the vilest of sinners, to cast down the idol they have set up? To shatter their faith in the very sanctuary where they seek solace? Or with you, Hester? You, who have borne the public scorn, whose punishment has been a constant, visible reminder of our sin? What right had I to add my burden to yours?”  “The right of a shared sorrow,” she replied, her voice gaining strength. “The right of a bond that, however sinful in its origin, has bound our souls together. Arthur, look at me! You are dying under this load. Your spirit is crushed, your body wasting away. This is no life! There must be a way out, a way to escape this torment.”  He shook his head, his eyes filled with a hopeless despair. “Escape? Where can I escape? The eye of God is upon me everywhere. The brand of my sin is burned into my very soul. I carry my own hell within me.”  “There is a path,” Hester urged, her eyes shining with a sudden, desperate hope. “A path into the wilderness! This forest is vast. Beyond it lies the great ocean. We can leave this place, Arthur! We can leave this rigid, cruel society behind. We can go to Europe, to some land where our past is unknown, where we can begin anew. We can be together, you and I, and Pearl. We can build a life free from the shadow of the scarlet letter and the burden of your hidden sin.”  She spoke with a passionate intensity, painting a picture of freedom and possibility that, for a moment, seemed to illuminate the dark forest glade. Dimmesdale listened, his face a study in conflicting emotions – fear, longing, doubt, and a flicker of something that might have been hope. The idea, so bold, so contrary to everything he had known, struck him with the force of a revelation. Could it be true? Could there be a sanctuary for them, not in the grave, but in the living world"

But the little stream would not be comforted, and still kept telling its unintelligible secret of some very mournful mystery that had happened—or making a prophetic lamentation about something that was yet to happen—within the verge of the dismal forest. So Pearl, who had enough of shadow in her own little life, chose to break off all acquaintance with this repining brook. She set herself, therefore, to gathering violets and wood-anemones, and some scarlet columbines that she found growing in the crevices of a high rock.\nWhen her elf-child had departed, Hester Prynne made a step or two towards the track that led through the forest, but still remained under the deep shadow of the trees.

He looked haggard and feeble, and betrayed a nerveless despondency in his air, which had never so remarkably characterized him in his walks about the settlement, nor in any other situation where he deemed himself liable to notice. Here it was wofully visible, in this intense seclusion of the forest, which of itself would have been a heavy trial to the spirits. There was a listlessness in his gait; as if he saw no reason for taking one step farther, nor felt any desire to do so, but would have been glad, could he be glad of anything, to fling himself down at the root of the nearest tree, and lie there passive, forevermore. The leaves might bestrew him, and the soil gradually accumulate and form a little hillock over his frame, no matter whether there were life in it or no.

After Pearl had departed, Hester Prynne made a step or two towards the forest-path, and stood still, concealed by the deep shade of the trees. She waited for Mr. Dimmesdale. The minister, with his hand over his heart, as was his custom, came slowly along the path. He was looking haggard and feeble, and his gait was listless, as if he had no energy or desire to go on, but would rather sink down and be absorbed by the earth, indifferent to life or death. He was in a state of spiritless despondency, which was far more pronounced in the seclusion of the forest than it ever was in public. His face was pale, and his eyes were heavy, and there was a look of profound dejection about him. The only visible indication of any active suffering was his habitual gesture of keeping his hand over his heart, a detail which Pearl had also observed.",

At length, she succeeded.\n“Arthur Dimmesdale!” she said, faintly at first; then louder, but hoarsely. “Arthur Dimmesdale!”\n“Who speaks?” answered the minister.\nGathering himself quickly up, he stood more erect, like a man taken by surprise in a mood to which he was reluctant to have witnesses. Throwing his eyes anxiously in the direction of the voice, he indistinctly beheld a form under the trees, clad in garments so sombre, and so little relieved from the gray twilight into which the clouded sky and the heavy foliage had darkened the noontide, that he knew not whether it were a woman or a shadow. It may be, that his pathway through life was haunted thus, by a spectre that had stolen out from among his thoughts.\nHe made a step nigher, and discovered the scarlet letter.\n“Hester! Hester Prynne!” said he. “Is it thou? Art thou in life?”\n“Even so!” she answered. “In such life as has been mine these seven years past! And thou, Arthur Dimmesdale, dost thou yet live?”\nIt was no wonder that they thus questioned one another’s actual and bodily existence, and even doubted of their own. So strangely did they meet, in the dim wood, that it was like the first encounter, in the world beyond the grave, of two spirits who had been intimately connected in their former life, but now stood coldly shuddering, in mutual dread; as not yet familiar with their state, nor wonted to the companionship of disembodied beings. Each a ghost, and awe-stricken at the other ghost! They were awe-stricken likewise at themselves; because the crisis flung back to them their consciousness, and revealed to each heart its history and experience, as life never does, except at such breathless epochs. The soul beheld its features in the mirror of the passing moment. It was with fear, and tremulously, and, as it were, by a slow, reluctant necessity, that Arthur Dimmesdale put forth his hand, chill as death, and touched the chill hand of Hester Prynne. The grasp, cold as it was, took away what was dreariest in the interview. They now felt themselves, at least, inhabitants of the same sphere.\nWithout a word more spoken,—neither he nor she assuming the guidance, but with an unexpressed consent,—they glided back into the shadow of the woods, whence Hester had emerged, and sat down on the heap of moss where she and Pearl had before been sitting. When they found voice to speak, it was, at first, only to utter remarks and inquiries such as any two acquaintance might have made, about the gloomy sky, the threatening storm, and, next, the health of each. Thus they went onward, not boldly, but step by step, into the themes that were brooding deepest in their hearts. So long estranged by fate and circumstances, they needed something slight and casual to run before, and throw open the doors of intercourse, so that their real thoughts might be led across the threshold.",

She hesitated, and trembled, and stood half affrighted, at what she was about to do, or what seemed almost to be done already, in her behalf, by some power which she herself had invoked, or by which she had been impelled. \"Arthur Dimmesdale!\" she said, faintly at first, then louder, but hoarsely. \"Arthur Dimmesdale!\" The minister started, shivered, and stood looking anxiously about him, uncertain whether to advance or retreat. One hand was pressed upon his breast, as if his heart were affected, or his nerves shattered. He looked towards the voice, and beheld, in the far distance, and dim light of the forest-path, a figure which he knew not whether it were a woman or a shadow, or precisely what it was, until it came nearer to him. As it drew nigh, he recognised Hester Prynne. He knew her by the scarlet letter on her bosom. \"Hester! Hester Prynne!\" said he. \"Is it thou? Art thou in life?\" \"Even so, Arthur Dimmesdale,\" she answered. \"In the flesh,\" said she. \"Yea, in the flesh!\" And she held out her hand towards him, but not to touch his own. \"Art thou in life?\" she repeated. \"Yea, I am in life,\" answered he. \"And yet I am conscious of it only by the agony of death!\" It was strange, probably, to both, that they should thus immediately, at the first moment of their meeting, make a solemn pause in the struggle of life, and survey one another in that brief interval. The intervening seven years were a wilderness, where they had wandered, each alone. Now they stood face to face, with the whole breadth of that wilderness betwixt them. It was their first encounter since they had been made strangers by the sin which they had committed together. With a chill despondency, like that of one who falls into a deep pit, Dimmesdale felt his spirits sink into the lowest depths. He knew not what to say, nor how to look. There was a strange estrangement between him and her, as if they had been in different worlds. \"Hester,\" said he, \"hast thou found peace?\" She shook her head. \"None!\" replied she. \"There is no peace, for me, in this world.\" He groaned. \"Nor for me,\" murmured Arthur Dimmesdale. \"Hester, Hester, thou art the cause of all this agony!\" She did not answer. They stood silent, looking at each other, in the dim light of the forest. At length, with a slow movement, as if every limb were heavy with lead, the minister advanced towards her. He held out his hand, but not to take hers. It was a gesture of greeting, not of love. She took it, and held it for a moment. Their hands were cold, as if they had been dead. The contact, however, was not without its effect. It lessened the dreariness of the interview. They felt themselves to be in the same sphere. Without further words, or any gesture of invitation or direction, they moved together into the deeper shadow of the woods, and sat down on the mossy trunk of a fallen tree, where Hester and Pearl had rested earlier in the day. When they began to speak, the first words were of the gloom of the forest, and the weather, and their health, and other such common topics, as if they were strangers meeting",

MAJOR STRUCTURAL ISSUES:\n- The completion introduces invented internal reflections and background about the minister’s prior agony and his ongoing emotional state, which are not present in the original passage at this point. This shifts the focus away from the immediate interaction and adds content that does not belong here.\n- The dialogue is partially restructured, with some lines attributed to the wrong speaker and some invented exchanges, altering the flow and sequence of the conversation.\n\n2. MISSING ELEMENTS:\n- The initial attempt by Hester to call out to the minister, including her struggle to find her voice and the progression from a faint to a louder call, is not fully represented.\n- The minister’s reaction upon hearing his name, including his surprise, change in posture, and anxious search for the speaker, is condensed and lacks the detailed description of his uncertainty and the visual ambiguity of Hester’s form in the dim light.\n- The passage describing the indistinct recognition of Hester, the mention of the scarlet letter as the identifying feature, and the uncertainty about whether the figure is a woman or a shadow, is missing.\n- The mutual questioning of each other's existence and the sense of unreality in their meeting is only partially captured, omitting the full sense of estrangement and the metaphorical comparison to spirits meeting after death.\n- The description of the emotional impact of the crisis, the reflection on their own histories, and the metaphor of the soul seeing itself in the moment is abbreviated or missing.\n- The slow, reluctant physical contact and its emotional effect are summarized but lack the original’s detail and nuance.\n- The silent, mutual decision to return to the mossy seat, and the specific mention of neither taking the lead, is not fully developed.\n- The gradual transition from mundane conversation to deeper topics, and the explanation for why this progression is necessary, is only briefly mentioned and lacks the original’s explanation of their estrangement and the need for casual conversation as a prelude.\n\n3. INACCURATE ELEMENTS:\n- The completion attributes lines of dialogue to the wrong characters and invents new lines that do not appear in the original, such as the minister’s statement about being dead for seven years and only living now because of Hester.\n- The sequence of events is altered, with the recognition and dialogue occurring in a different order than in the original.\n- The emotional tone is shifted by the addition of invented reflections and background, which changes the immediacy and atmosphere of the scene.\n- The description of the setting and the visual details of the encounter are condensed or omitted, reducing the sense of place and mood established in the original.\n\nTo improve, focus on accurately representing the sequence of events, preserving the original dialogue structure, and including the key descriptive and emotional elements without adding invented content or internal monologues not present in the source."

Were I an atheist,—a man devoid of conscience,—a wretch with coarse and brutal instincts,—I might have found peace, long ere now. Nay, I never should have lost it! But, as matters stand with my soul, whatever of good capacity there originally was in me, all of God’s gifts that were the choicest have become the ministers of spiritual torment. Hester, I am most miserable!”\n“The people reverence thee,” said Hester. “And surely thou workest good among them! Doth this bring thee no comfort?”\n“More misery, Hester!—only the more misery!” answered the clergyman, with a bitter smile. “As concerns the good which I may appear to do, I have no faith in it. It must needs be a delusion. What can a ruined soul, like mine, effect towards the redemption of other souls?—or a polluted soul towards their purification? And as for the people’s reverence, would that it were turned to scorn and hatred! Canst thou deem it, Hester, a consolation, that I must stand up in my pulpit, and meet so many eyes turned upward to my face, as if the light of heaven were beaming from it!—must see my flock hungry for the truth, and listening to my words as if a tongue of Pentecost were speaking!—and then look inward, and discern the black reality of what they idolize? I have laughed, in bitterness and agony of heart, at the contrast between what I seem and what I am! And Satan laughs at it!”\n“You wrong yourself in this,” said Hester, gently. “You have deeply and sorely repented. Your sin is left behind you, in the days long past. Your present life is not less holy, in very truth, than it seems in people’s eyes. Is there no reality in the penitence thus sealed and witnessed by good works? And wherefore should it not bring you peace?”\n“No, Hester, no!” replied the clergyman. “There is no substance in it! It is cold and dead, and can do nothing for me! Of penance, I have had enough! Of penitence, there has been none! Else, I should long ago have thrown off these garments of mock holiness, and have shown myself to mankind as they will see me at the judgment-seat. Happy are you, Hester, that wear the scarlet letter openly upon your bosom! Mine burns in secret! Thou little knowest what a relief it is, after the torment of a seven years’ cheat, to look into an eye that recognizes me for what I am! Had I one friend,—or were it my worst enemy!—to whom, when sickened with the praises of all other men, I could daily betake myself, and be known as the vilest of all sinners, methinks my soul might keep itself alive thereby.

          "text_segment": "Hester Prynne looked into his face, but hesitated to speak. Yet, uttering his long-restrained emotions so vehemently as he did, his words here offered her the very point of circumstances in which to interpose what she came to say. She conquered her fears, and spoke.\n“Such a friend as thou hast even now wished for,” said she, “with whom to weep over thy sin, thou hast in me, the partner of it!”—Again she hesitated, but brought out the words with an effort.—“Thou hast long had such an enemy, and dwellest with him, under the same roof!”\nThe minister started to his feet, gasping for breath, and clutching at his heart, as if he would have torn it out of his bosom.\n“Ha! What sayest thou!” cried he. “An enemy! And under mine own roof! What mean you?”\nHester Prynne was now fully sensible of the deep injury for which she was responsible to this unhappy man, in permitting him to lie for so many years, or, indeed, for a single moment, at the mercy of one whose purposes could not be other than malevolent. The very contiguity of his enemy, beneath whatever mask the latter might conceal himself, was enough to disturb the magnetic sphere of a being so sensitive as Arthur Dimmesdale. There had been a period when Hester was less alive to this consideration; or, perhaps, in the misanthropy of her own trouble, she left the minister to bear what she might picture to herself as a more tolerable doom. But of late, since the night of his vigil, all her sympathies towards him had been both softened and invigorated. She now read his heart more accurately. She doubted not, that the continual presence of Roger Chillingworth,—the secret poison of his malignity, infecting all the air about him,—and his authorized interference, as a physician, with the minister’s physical and spiritual infirmities,—that these bad opportunities had been turned to a cruel purpose. By means of them, the sufferer’s conscience had been kept in an irritated state, the tendency of which was, not to cure by wholesome pain, but to disorganize and corrupt his spiritual being. Its result, on earth, could hardly fail to be insanity, and hereafter, that eternal alienation from the Good and True, of which madness is perhaps the earthly type.\nSuch was the ruin to which she had brought the man, once,—nay, why should we not speak it?—still so passionately loved! Hester felt that the sacrifice of the clergyman’s good name, and death itself, as she had already told Roger Chillingworth, would have been infinitely preferable to the alternative which she had taken upon herself to choose. And now, rather than have had this grievous wrong to confess, she would gladly have lain down on the forest-leaves, and died there, at Arthur Dimmesdale’s feet.\n“O Arthur,” cried she, “forgive me! In all things else, I have striven to be true! Truth was the one virtue which I might have held fast, and did hold fast, through all extremity; save when thy good,—thy life,—thy fame,—were put in question! Then I consented to a deception. But a lie is never good, even though death threaten on the other side! Dost thou not see what I would say? That old man!—the physician!—he whom they call Roger Chillingworth!—he was my husband!”",

She was that friend. She was the one person in the world who could, with impunity, whisper all their past life into the clergyman's ear, and tell him what he was, and what he might have been.\n\n\"Arthur, is it I whom you seek and need?\" asked she, with a deep sound of feeling in her voice. \"I am your friend, and I am your partner in this sin!\"\n\nShe said this with a solemnity that seemed to make the hills about them echo the sound. Dimmesdale started back, gasping for breath, and clutching at his heart, as was his custom when strongly moved.\n\n\"Hester! Hester Prynne!\" cried he. \"Is it thou? Art thou the woman?\"\n\n\"I am that woman,\" answered Hester, \"and I am here to tell you that you have had a bitter enemy living with you under the same roof!\"\n\nDimmesdale's face grew deadly pale, and he trembled. \"An enemy? Who is he?\" he whispered, his voice barely audible.\n\nHester's heart sank within her. She saw now, with terrible clearness, the profound injury she had inflicted upon him by allowing him to be at the mercy of Roger Chillingworth's malevolence.

The forest gloom seemed to deepen around them, mirroring the heavy silence that lay between her and the Reverend Arthur Dimmesdale. His features, once so radiant with youthful piety, were now etched with lines of suffering, a pale, spectral mask of the man she had loved and ruined. His eyes, sunken and shadowed, held a desperate, pleading light, yet also a profound weariness, as if the very act of living were an unbearable burden. The scarlet letter on her breast felt like a brand of fire, not just upon her flesh, but upon the air itself, a visible barrier between her and the man who shared her secret sin, yet bore its weight in such a different, hidden manner. She saw the anguish in him, the slow, consuming torture that had wasted his form and dimmed his spirit, and her heart ached with a pity that was almost unbearable, mingled with the old, persistent tenderness that time and ignominy had failed to extinguish. What words could she offer? What solace could she provide to a soul so deeply wounded by its own concealed guilt? To speak of hope seemed cruel, to speak of their shared past, dangerous. Yet, the silence was a torment in itself, a vast, empty space filled with unspoken accusations and regrets. She saw him shiver slightly, despite the mildness of the forest air, a tremor that spoke of inner coldness, of a spirit perpetually chilled by fear and remorse. He looked away, his gaze fixed on the mossy roots of an ancient tree, as if seeking some answer there, some absolution that the earth itself might provide. The years had been cruel to them both, but perhaps crueler to him, whose penance was not the public shame she endured, but the gnawing, secret agony of a conscience perpetually scourged. She longed to reach out, to touch his hand, to bridge the chasm that society and their own choices had created. But the letter, the symbol of her shame, seemed to pulse with a malevolent energy, warning her back, reminding her of the gulf that lay between the openly condemned sinner and the secretly suffering saint. She swallowed hard, the words catching in her throat. The weight of their shared history, the burden of their present misery, and the utter uncertainty of their future pressed down upon her, making speech a monumental effort. She saw the question in his eyes when he finally looked back at her – a silent plea for understanding, for forgiveness, perhaps even for a shared acknowledgment of the terrible truth that bound them together. It was a moment fraught with peril and possibility, a fragile bubble of time suspended in the oppressive atmosphere of their shared fate. The forest, usually a place of wild freedom, felt instead like a cage, its dense foliage trapping their secrets within its confines. She knew she had to speak, to break"

Never was there a blacker or a fiercer frown than Hester now encountered. For the brief space that it lasted, it was a dark transfiguration. But his character had been so much enfeebled by suffering, that even its lower energies were incapable of more than a temporary struggle. He sank down on the ground, and buried his face in his hands.\n“I might have known it,” murmured he. “I did know it! Was not the secret told me, in the natural recoil of my heart, at the first sight of him, and as often as I have seen him since? Why did I not understand? O Hester Prynne, thou little, little knowest all the horror of this thing!

I cannot forgive thee!”\n“Thou shalt forgive me!” cried Hester, flinging herself on the fallen leaves beside him. “Let God punish! Thou shalt forgive!”\nWith sudden and desperate tenderness, she threw her arms around him, and pressed his head against her bosom; little caring though his cheek rested on the scarlet letter. He would have released himself, but strove in vain to do so. Hester would not set him free, lest he should look her sternly in the face. All the world had frowned on her,—for seven long years had it frowned upon this lonely woman,—and still she bore it all, nor ever once turned away her firm, sad eyes. Heaven, likewise, had frowned upon her, and she had not died. But the frown of this pale, weak, sinful, and sorrow-stricken man was what Hester could not bear and live!\n“Wilt thou yet forgive me?” she repeated, over and over again. “Wilt thou not frown? Wilt thou forgive?”\n“I do forgive you, Hester,” replied the minister, at length, with a deep utterance, out of an abyss of sadness, but no anger. “I freely forgive you now. May God forgive us both! We are not, Hester, the worst sinners in the world. There is one worse than even the polluted priest! That old man’s revenge has been blacker than my sin. He has violated, in cold blood, the sanctity of a human heart. Thou and I, Hester, never did so!”\n“Never, never!” whispered she. “What we did had a consecration of its own. We felt it so! We said so to each other! Hast thou forgotten it?”\n“Hush, Hester!” said Arthur Dimmesdale, rising from the ground. “No; I have not forgotten!”",

Life had never brought them a gloomier hour; it was the point whither their pathway had so long been tending, and darkening ever, as it stole along;—and yet it enclosed a charm that made them linger upon it, and claim another, and another, and, after all, another moment. The forest was obscure around them, and creaked with a blast that was passing through it. The boughs were tossing heavily above their heads; while one solemn old tree groaned dolefully to another, as if telling the sad story of the pair that sat beneath, or constrained to forebode evil to come.\nAnd yet they lingered. How dreary looked the forest-track that led backward to the settlement, where Hester Prynne must take up again the burden of her ignominy, and the minister the hollow mockery of his good name! So they lingered an instant longer. No golden light had ever been so precious as the gloom of this dark forest. Here, seen only by his eyes, the scarlet letter need not burn into the bosom of the fallen woman! Here, seen only by her eyes, Arthur Dimmesdale, false to God and man, might be, for one moment, true!\nHe started at a thought that suddenly occurred to him.\n“Hester,” cried he, “here is a new horror! Roger Chillingworth knows your purpose to reveal his true character. Will he continue, then, to keep our secret? What will now be the course of his revenge?”\n“There is a strange secrecy in his nature,” replied Hester, thoughtfully; “and it has grown upon him by the hidden practices of his revenge. I deem it not likely that he will betray the secret. He will doubtless seek other means of satiating his dark passion.”",

The great black forest, stern as it showed itself to the eye of an intruder, lay welcomingly around them, as if soothed by the presence of these two sufferers. Nature, in her kindly bosom, seemed to pity them. The leaves whispered above their heads, a gentle murmur of understanding. The sunlight, which had fled from the path, now dappled through the branches, touching their faces with a fleeting, uncertain light, much like the hope that flickered within their hearts. For a long time, neither spoke. The silence was not empty, but filled with the unspoken language of shared misery and a love that had survived years of separation and public ignominy for one, and secret torment for the other. Hester felt the tremor in his hand, a vibration of the agony that consumed him. She looked at his face, so worn, so pale, the lines of suffering etched deep. The minister, in turn, gazed at her, at the scarlet letter that seemed to glow even in the dim light, the symbol of her outward shame, which was perhaps less terrible than his inward one. At length, Hester broke the silence, her voice low, almost a whisper, as if fearing to disturb the sanctity of their brief sanctuary. 'Arthur,' she said, using his Christian name, a sound that had been forbidden to her lips for so long, 'the past is gone. Why should we sink under it any longer? See! With this symbol, I have ransomed thee from the keeping of this wretched man!' She touched the scarlet letter on her breast, a gesture of defiance and liberation. 'We are not dead! We are not in our graves! The sun shines, and we are here! Let us not look back, but forward! There is a path before us!'"

Thou art strong. Resolve for me!”\n“Thou must dwell no longer with this man,” said Hester, slowly and firmly. “Thy heart must be no longer under his evil eye!”\n“It were far worse than death!” replied the minister. “But how to avoid it? What choice remains to me? Shall I lie down again on these withered leaves, where I cast myself when thou didst tell me what he was? Must I sink down there, and die at once?”\n“Alas, what a ruin has befallen thee!” said Hester, with the tears gushing into her eyes. “Wilt thou die for very weakness? There is no other cause!”\n“The judgment of God is on me,” answered the conscience-stricken priest. “It is too mighty for me to struggle with!”\n“Heaven would show mercy,” rejoined Hester, “hadst thou but the strength to take advantage of it.”\n“Be thou strong for me!” answered he. “Advise me what to do.”\n“Is the world, then, so narrow?” exclaimed Hester Prynne, fixing her deep eyes on the minister’s, and instinctively exercising a magnetic power over a spirit so shattered and subdued that it could hardly hold itself erect. “Doth the universe lie within the compass of yonder town, which only a little time ago was but a leaf-strewn desert, as lonely as this around us? Whither leads yonder forest-track? Backward to the settlement, thou sayest! Yes; but onward, too. Deeper it goes, and deeper, into the wilderness, less plainly to be seen at every step; until, some few miles hence, the yellow leaves will show no vestige of the white man’s tread. There thou art free! So brief a journey would bring thee from a world where thou hast been most wretched, to one where thou mayest still be happy! Is there not shade enough in all this boundless forest to hide thy heart from the gaze of Roger Chillingworth?”\n“Yes, Hester; but only under the fallen leaves!” replied the minister, with a sad smile.\n“Then there is the broad pathway of the sea!” continued Hester. “It brought thee hither. If thou so choose, it will bear thee back again. In our native land, whether in some remote rural village or in vast London,—or, surely, in Germany, in France, in pleasant Italy,—thou wouldst be beyond his power and knowledge! And what hast thou to do with all these iron men, and their opinions? They have kept thy better part in bondage too long already!”\n“It cannot be!” answered the minister, listening as if he were called upon to realize a dream. “I am powerless to go! Wretched and sinful as I am, I have had no other thought than to drag on my earthly existence in the sphere where Providence hath placed me. Lost as my own soul is, I would still do what I may for other human souls! I dare not quit my post, though an unfaithful sentinel, whose sure reward is death and dishonor, when his dreary watch shall come to an end!”\n“Thou art crushed under this seven years’ weight of misery,” replied Hester, fervently resolved to buoy him up with her own energy. “But thou shalt leave it all behind thee! It shall not cumber thy steps, as thou treadest along the forest-path; neither shalt thou freight the ship with it, if thou prefer to cross the sea. Leave this wreck and ruin here where it hath happened. Meddle no more with it! Begin all anew! Hast thou exhausted possibility in the failure of this one trial? Not so! The future is yet full of trial and success. There is happiness to be enjoyed! There is good to be done! Exchange this false life of thine for a true one. Be, if thy spirit summon thee to such a mission, the teacher and apostle of the red men. Or,—as is more thy nature,—be a scholar and a sage among the wisest and the most renowned of the cultivated world. Preach! Write! Act! Do anything, save to lie down and die! Give up this name of Arthur Dimmesdale, and make thyself another, and a high one, such as thou canst wear without fear or shame. Why shouldst thou tarry so much as one other day in the torments that have so gnawed into thy life!—that have made thee feeble to will and to do!—that will leave thee powerless even to repent! Up, and away!”\n“O Hester!” cried Arthur Dimmesdale, in whose eyes a fitful light, kindled by her enthusiasm, flashed up and died away, “thou tellest of running a race to a man whose knees are tottering beneath him! I must die here! There is not the strength or courage left me to venture into the wide, strange, difficult world, alone!”\nIt was the last expression of the despondency of a broken spirit. He lacked energy to grasp the better fortune that seemed within his reach.\nHe repeated the word.\n“Alone, Hester!”\n“Thou shalt not go alone!” answered she, in a deep whisper.\nThen, all was spoken!",

She had wandered, without rule or guidance, in a moral wilderness; as vast, as intricate and shadowy, as the untamed forest, amid the gloom of which they were now holding a colloquy that was to decide their fate. Her intellect and heart had their home, as it were, in desert places, where she roamed as freely as the wild Indian in his woods. For years past she had looked from this estranged point of view at human institutions, and whatever priests or legislators had established; criticising all with hardly more reverence than the Indian would feel for the clerical band, the judicial robe, the pillory, the gallows, the fireside, or the church. The tendency of her fate and fortunes had been to set her free. The scarlet letter was her passport into regions where other women dared not tread. Shame, Despair, Solitude! These had been her teachers,—stern and wild ones,—and they had made her strong, but taught her much amiss.\nThe minister, on the other hand, had never gone through an experience calculated to lead him beyond the scope of generally received laws; although, in a single instance, he had so fearfully transgressed one of the most sacred of them. But this had been a sin of passion, not of principle, nor even purpose. Since that wretched epoch, he had watched, with morbid zeal and minuteness, not his acts,—for those it was easy to arrange,—but each breath of emotion, and his every thought. At the head of the social system, as the clergymen of that day stood, he was only the more trammelled by its regulations, its principles, and even its prejudices. As a priest, the framework of his order inevitably hemmed him in. As a man who had once sinned, but who kept his conscience all alive and painfully sensitive by the fretting of an unhealed wound, he might have been supposed safer within the line of virtue than if he had never sinned at all.\nThus, we seem to see that, as regarded Hester Prynne, the whole seven years of outlaw and ignominy had been little other than a preparation for this very hour. But Arthur Dimmesdale! Were such a man once more to fall, what plea could be urged in extenuation of his crime? None; unless it avail him somewhat, that he was broken down by long and exquisite suffering; that his mind was darkened and confused by the very remorse which harrowed it; that, between fleeing as an avowed criminal, and remaining as a hypocrite, conscience might find it hard to strike the balance; that it was human to avoid the peril of death and infamy, and the inscrutable machinations of an enemy; that, finally, to this poor pilgrim, on his dreary and desert path, faint, sick, miserable, there appeared a glimpse of human affection and sympathy, a new life, and a true one, in exchange for the heavy doom which he was now expiating. And be the stern and sad truth spoken, that the breach which guilt has once made into the human soul is never, in this mortal state, repaired. It may be watched and guarded; so that the enemy shall not force his way again into the citadel, and might even, in his subsequent assaults, select some other avenue, in preference to that where he had formerly succeeded. But there is still the ruined wall, and, near it, the stealthy tread of the foe that would win over again his unforgotten triumph.",

But now,—since I am irrevocably doomed,—wherefore should I not snatch the solace allowed to the condemned culprit before his execution? Or, if this be the path to a better life, as Hester would persuade me, I surely give up no fairer prospect by pursuing it! Neither can I any longer live without her companionship; so powerful is she to sustain,—so tender to soothe! O Thou to whom I dare not lift mine eyes, wilt Thou yet pardon me!”\n“Thou wilt go!” said Hester, calmly, as he met her glance.\nThe decision once made, a glow of strange enjoyment threw its flickering brightness over the trouble of his breast. It was the exhilarating effect—upon a prisoner just escaped from the dungeon of his own heart—of breathing the wild, free atmosphere of an unredeemed, unchristianized, lawless region. His spirit rose, as it were, with a bound, and attained a nearer prospect of the sky, than throughout all the misery which had kept him grovelling on the earth. Of a deeply religious temperament, there was inevitably a tinge of the devotional in his mood.\n“Do I feel joy again?” cried he, wondering at himself. “Methought the germ of it was dead in me! O Hester, thou art my better angel! I seem to have flung myself—sick, sin-stained, and sorrow-blackened—down upon these forest-leaves, and to have risen up all made anew, and with new powers to glorify Him that hath been merciful!

By another impulse, she took off the formal cap that confined her hair; and down it fell upon her shoulders, dark and rich, with at once a shadow and a light in its abundance, and imparting the charm of softness to her features. There played around her mouth, and beamed out of her eyes, a radiant and tender smile, that seemed gushing from the very heart of womanhood. A crimson flush was glowing on her cheek, that had been long so pale. Her sex, her youth, and the whole richness of her beauty, came back from what men call the irrevocable past, and clustered themselves, with her maiden hope, and a happiness before unknown, within the magic circle of this hour. And, as if the gloom of the earth and sky had been but the effluence of these two mortal hearts, it vanished with their sorrow. All at once, as with a sudden smile of heaven, forth burst the sunshine, pouring a very flood into the obscure forest, gladdening each green leaf, transmuting the yellow fallen ones to gold, and gleaming adown the gray trunks of the solemn trees. The objects that had made a shadow hitherto, embodied the brightness now. The course of the little brook might be traced by its merry gleam afar into the wood’s heart of mystery, which had become a mystery of joy.\nSuch was the sympathy of Nature—that wild, heathen Nature of the forest, never subjugated by human law, nor illumined by higher truth—with the bliss of these two spirits! Love, whether newly born, or aroused from a death-like slumber, must always create a sunshine, filling the heart so full of radiance, that it overflows upon the outward world. Had the forest still kept its gloom, it would have been bright in Hester’s eyes, and bright in Arthur Dimmesdale’s!",

Wherefore should we linger upon it now? See! With this symbol, I undo it all, and make it as if it had never been!”\n\nSo speaking, she undid the clasp that fastened the scarlet letter, and, taking it from her bosom, threw it to a distance among the withered leaves. The forest-brook, glimmering through the shadows, was close at hand; and, had the symbol fallen into it, the brook might yet have told the dark secret, and borne the burden onward with its melancholy murmur. But the letter lay among the fallen leaves, a blot upon the beautiful repose of nature, until a little brook had stolen upon it, and bathed it in its smile.\n\nHester felt as if she had been from birth a distinct object, marked out for infamy, and compelled to show her ignominy to the world. But now, she was free! The weight of a world was lifted from her spirit. She had not known the weight, until she felt the freedom! By another impulse, she took off the formal cap that confined her hair, and down it fell upon her shoulders, dark and rich, with a luxuriant abundance. So graphic a description as this, and so beautiful, was not merely a man's idea of a woman's beauty, but a woman's idea of her own. Her face, so long familiar with the gloom of sorrow, was now illuminated with a radiant and tender smile, that seemed to come from the very heart of her womanhood. A crimson flush, which she had long been a stranger to, came back to her cheeks, and suffused her whole face with a glow of youth and beauty. Her youth, her beauty, came back to her, as if the past had been a dream, and she had just awakened to the present.\n\nAll at once, as if by a spell, the gloom of the forest was gone. A flood of sunshine, which had been vainly striving to penetrate the thick canopy of leaves, now poured itself down upon the spot, and gladdened the foliage and the fallen leaves, which seemed to turn to gold as they lay upon the ground. The objects that had been in shadow, now shone brightly, and the brook, which had been a mystery, now gleamed merrily, as if it had caught the sunshine in its bosom. Nature, in her kindly sympathy, seemed to have caught the sunshine in her bosom too, and to have poured it forth upon the spot, where the two lovers stood.

With this symbol, I undo the spell, and remove the dark victory from the power of the Puritan brotherhood!” As she spoke, she undid the clasp that fastened the scarlet letter, and, taking it from her bosom, threw it to a distance among the withered leaves that lay strewn on the forest floor. The effect was startling. As if the weight of a world had been lifted from her spirit, she felt a sudden, gushing flood of joy. Her sex, her youth, and the whole richness of her womanhood, burst forth from the long restraint that had kept them in patient subjection. The forest, with its old, familiar trees, its whispering leaves, and its wild, untamed spirit, seemed to welcome her back into its embrace. The sunshine, which had been so shy and elusive, now streamed down upon her, bathing her in a golden light. Her beauty, so long hidden beneath the somber garb and the shadow of the letter, returned with a sudden radiance. Her hair, which she had confined beneath a cap, she let fall in a luxuriant flood, with a flush of maidenly shame, yet with a sense of inexpressible relief. It was as if she had been reborn, shedding the skin of her past suffering and emerging into the light of a new day. Dimmesdale, watching her transformation, felt a thrill pass through him. He had never seen her thus, so free, so radiant, so utterly herself. The burden of his own sin, which had weighed him down for so many years, seemed momentarily to lighten in the glow of her liberation. “Hester,” he whispered, his voice full of awe and wonder, “is it true? Can we truly leave it all behind? The shame, the guilt, the endless torment?” “We can,” she affirmed, her eyes shining with a fierce hope. “We will! The forest is our sanctuary. Here, the laws of man do not reach. Here, we are free to be ourselves, to love, to live, without fear of judgment. We will cross the ocean, Arthur, to a new world, where we can build a life together, a life free from the shadows of the past. We will be together, you and I, and our little Pearl. She will know her father, and we will be a family, whole and unbroken.” Her words painted a vivid picture of a future they had only dared to dream of in the darkest corners of"

The great black forest—stern as it showed itself to those who brought the guilt and troubles of the world into its bosom—became the playmate of the lonely infant, as well as it knew how. Sombre as it was, it put on the kindest of its moods to welcome her. It offered her the partridge-berries, the growth of the preceding autumn, but ripening only in the spring, and now red as drops of blood upon the withered leaves. These Pearl gathered, and was pleased with their wild flavor. The small denizens of the wilderness hardly took pains to move out of her path. A partridge, indeed, with a brood of ten behind her, ran forward threateningly, but soon repented of her fierceness, and clucked to her young ones not to be afraid. A pigeon, alone on a low branch, allowed Pearl to come beneath, and uttered a sound as much of greeting as alarm. A squirrel, from the lofty depths of his domestic tree, chattered either in anger or merriment,—for a squirrel is such a choleric and humorous little personage, that it is hard to distinguish between his moods,—so he chattered at the child, and flung down a nut upon her head. It was a last year’s nut, and already gnawed by his sharp tooth. A fox, startled from his sleep by her light footstep on the leaves, looked inquisitively at Pearl, as doubting whether it were better to steal off, or renew his nap on the same spot. A wolf, it is said,—but here the tale has surely lapsed into the improbable,—came up, and smelt of Pearl’s robe, and offered his savage head to be patted by her hand. The truth seems to be, however, that the mother-forest, and these wild things which it nourished, all recognized a kindred wildness in the human child.\nAnd she was gentler here than in the grassy-margined streets of the settlement, or in her mother’s cottage. The flowers appeared to know it; and one and another whispered as she passed, “Adorn thyself with me, thou beautiful child, adorn thyself with me!”—and, to please them, Pearl gathered the violets, and anemones, and columbines, and some twigs of the freshest green, which the old trees held down before her eyes. With these she decorated her hair, and her young waist, and became a nymph-child, or an infant dryad, or whatever else was in closest sympathy with the antique wood. In such guise had Pearl adorned herself, when she heard her mother’s voice, and came slowly back.\nSlowly; for she saw the clergyman.",

But Pearl, who was a dauntless child, after becoming familiar with the wildness of the wood, was glad to forsake the gloom and concave perplexity of the narrow footpath, and wander about among the great trunks of the old trees, peering into the mystery of their shadows. She was not afraid of them, but communed with the antique wood-spirits, and knew why they sighed and moaned. The forest was her home, where she might play like a child, and be happy. She gathered partridge-berries, and ate them with a wild relish. The small creatures of the wilderness hardly stirred when she passed by. A partridge, indeed, with a brood of ten chickens, at first fluttered wildly up, as she approached, and uttered a loud cry of alarm, but Pearl had no sooner made a soft, caressing sound, than the mother-bird became calm, and her chickens ceased to be agitated. They all stood still, and Pearl passed on without further disturbance. A pigeon, feeding on the ground not far off, did not even take flight, but waited till Pearl had gone by, and then resumed its meal. A squirrel, from the lofty branch of a great oak, chattered at the child, and flung down a nut upon her head. It was a year-old nut, and had been gnawed by squirrels long ago. Pearl picked it up, and played with it a little while, and then threw it away. A fox, awakened by her light footsteps, peered forth from the hollow trunk of a tree, and gazed at her with his sharp, bright eyes. Pearl gave him a smile, and passed on. The wolf, the fiercest beast of the forest, was said to be a familiar of Pearl. He had been seen to follow her, and to sniff at her garments. He had even been known to lay his head upon her lap, and to allow her to pat him. The mother-forest, and the wild things which lived in it, seemed to recognize a kindred wildness in the child. And, in return, Pearl felt a sense of brotherhood with the wild things, and a sense of sisterhood with the mother-forest. She was gentler here than she was in the town, or in her mother's cottage. The flowers, too, seemed to know her, and to love her. They beckoned to her, and invited her to adorn herself with their loveliness. Pearl gathered violets, and anemones, and columbines, and fresh green twigs, and wove them into a garland for her hair, and a girdle for her waist. She looked like a little nymph, or a dryad, or some other creature of the woods. She was in perfect harmony with the ancient trees, and the wild things that lived in their shade. It was in this embellished state that Pearl heard her mother's call, and started to return. She approached at a slow pace, because she observed the clergyman present with her mother.",

The brook, with its never-ceasing murmur, was a companion that never grew moody or strange, as Pearl’s human companions were apt to do. She had followed its course, a little way, and had found a sort of playmate of her own in the little stream. It was the brook that bore the forest’s secrets on its bosom, and whispered them to the child. Pearl had decked her hair with flowers that grew beside the water, and had made a little boat of a broad leaf, which she launched on the current, and watched it float away, imagining it a vessel bound for some unknown shore. She had talked to the trees, and they had seemed to answer her in the rustling of their leaves. She had chased the butterflies, and they had led her deeper into the green, sun-dappled solitude. The forest, to Pearl, was not a dark and dreadful place, but a vast, mysterious playground, where she was free to be herself, the wild, untamed sprite that she was. She was a child of the forest, as much as of the brook and the sunshine. Her spirit was as free and elusive as the wind that stirred the branches overhead. She had no concept of time, save as the shifting patterns of light and shadow on"

And see with what natural skill she has made those simple flowers adorn her! Had she gathered pearls, and diamonds, and rubies, in the wood, they could not have become her better. She is a splendid child! But I know whose brow she has!”\n“Dost thou know, Hester,” said Arthur Dimmesdale, with an unquiet smile, “that this dear child, tripping about always at thy side, hath caused me many an alarm? Methought—O Hester, what a thought is that, and how terrible to dread it!—that my own features were partly repeated in her face, and so strikingly that the world might see them! But she is mostly thine!”\n“No, no! Not mostly!” answered the mother, with a tender smile. “A little longer, and thou needest not to be afraid to trace whose child she is. But how strangely beautiful she looks, with those wild-flowers in her hair! It is as if one of the fairies, whom we left in our dear old England, had decked her out to meet us.”\nIt was with a feeling which neither of them had ever before experienced, that they sat and watched Pearl’s slow advance. In her was visible the tie that united them. She had been offered to the world, these seven years past, as the living hieroglyphic, in which was revealed the secret they so darkly sought to hide,—all written in this symbol,—all plainly manifest,—had there been a prophet or magician skilled to read the character of flame! And Pearl was the oneness of their being. Be the foregone evil what it might, how could they doubt that their earthly lives and future destinies were conjoined, when they beheld at once the material union, and the spiritual idea, in whom they met, and were to dwell immortally together? Thoughts like these—and perhaps other thoughts, which they did not acknowledge or define—threw an awe about the child, as she came onward.\n“Let her see nothing strange—no passion nor eagerness—in thy way of accosting her,” whispered Hester. “Our Pearl is a fitful and fantastic little elf, sometimes. Especially, she is seldom tolerant of emotion, when she does not fully comprehend the why and wherefore. But the child hath strong affections! She loves me, and will love thee!”\n“Thou canst not think,” said the minister, glancing aside at Hester Prynne, “how my heart dreads this interview, and yearns for it! But, in truth, as I already told thee, children are not readily won to be familiar with me. They will not climb my knee, nor prattle in my ear, nor answer to my smile; but stand apart, and eye me strangely. Even little babes, when I take them in my arms, weep bitterly. Yet Pearl, twice in her little lifetime, hath been kind to me! The first time,—thou knowest it well! The last was when thou ledst her with thee to the house of yonder stern old Governor.”\n“And thou didst plead so bravely in her behalf and mine!” answered the mother. “I remember it; and so shall little Pearl. Fear nothing! She may be strange and shy at first, but will soon learn to love thee!”",

Just where she had paused, the brook chanced to form a pool, so smooth and quiet that it reflected a perfect image of her little figure, with all the brilliant picturesqueness of her beauty, in its adornment of flowers and wreathed foliage, but more refined and spiritualized than the reality. This image, so nearly identical with the living Pearl, seemed to communicate somewhat of its own shadowy and intangible quality to the child herself. It was strange, the way in which Pearl stood, looking so steadfastly at them through the dim medium of the forest-gloom; herself, meanwhile, all glorified with a ray of sunshine, that was attracted thitherward as by a certain sympathy. In the brook beneath stood another child,—another and the same,—with likewise its ray of golden light. Hester felt herself, in some indistinct and tantalizing manner, estranged from Pearl; as if the child, in her lonely ramble through the forest, had strayed out of the sphere in which she and her mother dwelt together, and was now vainly seeking to return to it.\nThere was both truth and error in the impression; the child and mother were estranged, but through Hester’s fault, not Pearl’s. Since the latter rambled from her side, another inmate had been admitted within the circle of the mother’s feelings, and so modified the aspect of them all, that Pearl, the returning wanderer, could not find her wonted place, and hardly knew where she was.\n“I have a strange fancy,” observed the sensitive minister, “that this brook is the boundary between two worlds, and that thou canst never meet thy Pearl again. Or is she an elfish spirit, who, as the legends of our childhood taught us, is forbidden to cross a running stream? Pray hasten her; for this delay has already imparted a tremor to my nerves.”",

Else I must come to thee!”\nBut Pearl, not a whit startled at her mother’s threats, any more than mollified by her entreaties, now suddenly burst into a fit of passion, gesticulating violently, and throwing her small figure into the most extravagant contortions.

Save it were the cankered wrath of an old witch, like Mistress Hibbins,” added he, attempting to smile, “I know nothing that I would not sooner encounter than this passion in a child. In Pearl’s young beauty, as in the wrinkled witch, it has a preternatural effect. Pacify her, if thou lovest me!”\nHester turned again towards Pearl, with a crimson blush upon her cheek, a conscious glance aside at the clergyman, and then a heavy sigh; while, even before she had time to speak, the blush yielded to a deadly pallor.\n“Pearl,” said she, sadly, “look down at thy feet! There!—before thee!—on the hither side of the brook!”\nThe child turned her eyes to the point indicated; and there lay the scarlet letter, so close upon the margin of the stream, that the gold embroidery was reflected in it.\n“Bring it hither!” said Hester.\n“Come thou and take it up!” answered Pearl.\n“Was ever such a child!” observed Hester, aside to the minister. “O, I have much to tell thee about her! But, in very truth, she is right as regards this hateful token. I must bear its torture yet a little longer,—only a few days longer,—until we shall have left this region, and look back hither as to a land which we have dreamed of. The forest cannot hide it! The mid-ocean shall take it from my hand, and swallow it up forever!”\nWith these words, she advanced to the margin of the brook, took up the scarlet letter, and fastened it again into her bosom. Hopefully, but a moment ago, as Hester had spoken of drowning it in the deep sea, there was a sense of inevitable doom upon her, as she thus received back this deadly symbol from the hand of fate. She had flung it into infinite space!—she had drawn an hour’s free breath!—and here again was the scarlet misery, glittering on the old spot! So it ever is, whether thus typified or no, that an evil deed invests itself with the character of doom. Hester next gathered up the heavy tresses of her hair, and confined them beneath her cap.

It was only by an exertion of force that her mother brought her up to him, hanging back, and manifesting her reluctance by odd grimaces; of which, ever since her babyhood, she had possessed a singular variety, and could transform her mobile physiognomy into a series of different aspects, with a new mischief in them, each and all. The minister—painfully embarrassed, but hoping that a kiss might prove a talisman to admit him into the child’s kindlier regards—bent forward, and impressed one on her brow. Hereupon, Pearl broke away from her mother, and, running to the brook, stooped over it, and bathed her forehead, until the unwelcome kiss was quite washed off, and diffused through a long lapse of the gliding water. She then remained apart, silently watching Hester and the clergyman; while they talked together, and made such arrangements as were suggested by their new position, and the purposes soon to be fulfilled.\nAnd now this fateful interview had come to a close. The dell was to be left a solitude among its dark, old trees, which, with their multitudinous tongues, would whisper long of what had passed there, and no mortal be the wiser.

So great a vicissitude in his life could not at once be received as real. But there was Hester, clad in her gray robe, still standing beside the tree-trunk, which some blast had overthrown a long antiquity ago, and which time had ever since been covering with moss, so that these two fated ones, with earth’s heaviest burden on them, might there sit down together, and find a single hour’s rest and solace. And there was Pearl, too, lightly dancing from the margin of the brook,—now that the intrusive third person was gone,—and taking her old place by her mother’s side. So the minister had not fallen asleep and dreamed!\nIn order to free his mind from this indistinctness and duplicity of impression, which vexed it with a strange disquietude, he recalled and more thoroughly defined the plans which Hester and himself had sketched for their departure. It had been determined between them, that the Old World, with its crowds and cities, offered them a more eligible shelter and concealment than the wilds of New England, or all America, with its alternatives of an Indian wigwam, or the few settlements of Europeans, scattered thinly along the seaboard. Not to speak of the clergyman’s health, so inadequate to sustain the hardships of a forest life, his native gifts, his culture, and his entire development, would secure him a home only in the midst of civilization and refinement; the higher the state, the more delicately adapted to it the man. In furtherance of this choice, it so happened that a ship lay in the harbor; one of those questionable cruisers, frequent at that day, which, without being absolutely outlaws of the deep, yet roamed over its surface with a remarkable irresponsibility of character. This vessel had recently arrived from the Spanish Main, and, within three days’ time, would sail for Bristol. Hester Prynne—whose vocation, as a self-enlisted Sister of Charity, had brought her acquainted with the captain and crew—could take upon herself to secure the passage of two individuals and a child, with all the secrecy which circumstances rendered more than desirable.",

But he remembered the plan that he and Hester had discussed. It was to be a flight, and a secret one, in a few days, when the vessel should be ready to sail.

But they were there, in the full reality of their being, and his spirit bounded at the sight. A spell had been broken. The great black forest, they knew, was on the other side of the bright sunshine, and beyond that again lay the broad sea, which was to bear them away to a new life. The future, which had heretofore been a dark and fearful abyss, now opened before him, a vast, untrodden space of possibility and hope. He felt a wild exhilaration, a sense of freedom so profound and intoxicating that it seemed to lift him above the earth. The burden of years of concealed agony, of self-inflicted penance, of the crushing weight of public reverence built upon a foundation of lies, had suddenly been cast off. He was no longer the sainted Arthur Dimmesdale, the revered pastor of the Puritan flock, but simply a man, standing on the verge of a new existence with the woman he loved and their child. The forest path, which had always seemed a somber aisle leading deeper into gloom, now appeared illuminated, not by outward light, but by the radiance of his own liberated soul. The trees whispered secrets of joy, the birds sang anthems of freedom, and the very air seemed to vibrate with a newfound vitality. He walked with a lighter step, his head held higher, a faint smile playing upon his lips. Yet, beneath the surface of this elation, there was a tremor of fear, a dizzying sense of unreality. Had he truly dared to defy the iron rule of his society, the stern decree of his conscience? Was this sudden lightness a sign of salvation or a prelude to a deeper fall? He could not tell, but for the moment, he surrendered himself to the intoxicating promise of escape, leaving behind the shadows of the past and walking towards an uncertain, yet thrilling, future with Hester and Pearl."

It was their chosen means of escape, the tangible promise of freedom from the oppressive gaze of Puritan society and the relentless torment of Chillingworth. Dimmesdale listened intently, his pale face momentarily illuminated by a flicker of desperate hope. He envisioned a life where he could walk openly with Hester and Pearl, free from the crushing weight of his secret sin and the hypocrisy that had consumed him.

The pathway among the woods seemed wilder, more uncouth with its rude natural obstacles, and less trodden by the foot of man, than he remembered it on his outward journey. But he leaped across the plashy places, thrust himself through the clinging underbrush, climbed the ascent, plunged into the hollow, and overcame, in short, all the difficulties of the track, with an unweariable activity that astonished him. He could not but recall how feebly, and with what frequent pauses for breath, he had toiled over the same ground, only two days before. As he drew near the town, he took an impression of change from the series of familiar objects that presented themselves. It seemed not yesterday, not one, nor two, but many days, or even years ago, since he had quitted them. There, indeed, was each former trace of the street, as he remembered it, and all the peculiarities of the houses, with the due multitude of gable-peaks, and a weathercock at every point where his memory suggested one. Not the less, however, came this importunately obtrusive sense of change. The same was true as regarded the acquaintances whom he met, and all the well-known shapes of human life, about the little town. They looked neither older nor younger now; the beards of the aged were no whiter, nor could the creeping babe of yesterday walk on his feet to-day; it was impossible to describe in what respect they differed from the individuals on whom he had so recently bestowed a parting glance; and yet the minister’s deepest sense seemed to inform him of their mutability. A similar impression struck him most remarkably, as he passed under the walls of his own church. The edifice had so very strange, and yet so familiar, an aspect, that Mr. Dimmesdale’s mind vibrated between two ideas; either that he had seen it only in a dream hitherto, or that he was merely dreaming about it now.\nThis phenomenon, in the various shapes which it assumed, indicated no external change, but so sudden and important a change in the spectator of the familiar scene, that the intervening space of a single day had operated on his consciousness like the lapse of years. The minister’s own will, and Hester’s will, and the fate that grew between them, had wrought this transformation. It was the same town as heretofore; but the same minister returned not from the forest. He might have said to the friends who greeted him,—“I am not the man for whom you take me! I left him yonder in the forest, withdrawn into a secret dell, by a mossy tree-trunk, and near a melancholy brook! Go, seek your minister, and see if his emaciated figure, his thin cheek, his white, heavy, pain-wrinkled brow, be not flung down there, like a cast-off garment!” His friends, no doubt, would still have insisted with him,—“Thou art thyself the man!”—but the error would have been their own, not his.",

He had told Hester that he was a changed man, and he felt it now, not merely in the liberation of his spirit, but in a wild, almost sacrilegious exhilaration that pulsed through his veins. The familiar path seemed new, the trees whispered secrets he had never heard, and the very air felt charged with a reckless freedom. As he approached the outskirts of the settlement, the rigid structures of Puritan life, the meeting-house, the stocks, the grave-yard, all appeared in a distorted light, as if viewed through a prism of sin and rebellion. He encountered a deacon of the church, a man of grave and holy aspect. Dimmesdale felt an almost irresistible impulse to utter a \"wicked, blasphemous, or ridiculous\" suggestion to him, something that would shatter the deacon's pious composure. He barely restrained himself, passing with a hurried greeting, his heart pounding with a mixture of horror at his own thought and a strange, dark amusement. Next, he met the oldest female member of his church, a woman whose faith was as simple and steadfast as a child's. To her, he felt tempted to drop a hint that would shake her belief in the immortality of the soul, a cruel, intellectual poison. Again, he bit back the words, shuddering at the depravity that seemed to have taken root within him. A young maiden, a recent convert, crossed his path, her face radiant with innocent admiration for her pastor. A thought, \"not fit to be spoken, nor even conceived,\" flashed into his mind, a suggestion of impurity that would have withered her soul. He fled from her presence, aghast at the transformation within him. Even the children, usually the objects of his tenderest regard, seemed to provoke a perverse instinct. He longed to teach them \"wicked words,\" to plant seeds of mischief and disobedience in their innocent minds. He questioned his sanity, his identity. Was this the same Arthur Dimmesdale who had walked among them, a paragon of holiness? Or had the forest interview, the pact with Hester, unleashed a demon? He reached the parsonage, where Chillingworth awaited him. The physician's face, usually a mask of subtle malice, seemed to him now openly fiendish, a reflection of the evil he felt stirring within himself. Dimmesdale, with a newfound strength born of desperation and this strange energy, dismissed Chillingworth, declaring he no longer needed his remedies. He went to his study, where the unfinished Election Sermon lay. The words he had prepared seemed stale, lifeless, utterly inadequate to express the tempest in his soul or the message he now felt compelled to deliver. With feverish energy, he tore up the old manuscript and began to write anew. The words flowed from him, not with the painful effort of his usual composition, but with a torrent of inspiration, fueled by the dark fire that consumed him. He wrote through the night, the candle burning low, his mind ablaze, pouring out the anguish, the sin, the newfound, terrible knowledge of his own heart onto the page. As dawn approached, the sermon was complete, a masterpiece born of agony and a desperate, final surge of power."

In truth, nothing short of a total change of dynasty and moral code, in that interior kingdom, was adequate to account for the impulses now communicated to the unfortunate and startled minister. At every step he was incited to do some strange, wild, wicked thing or other, with a sense that it would be at once involuntary and intentional; in spite of himself, yet growing out of a profounder self than that which opposed the impulse. For instance, he met one of his own deacons. The good old man addressed him with the paternal affection and patriarchal privilege, which his venerable age, his upright and holy character, and his station in the Church, entitled him to use; and, conjoined with this, the deep, almost worshipping respect, which the minister’s professional and private claims alike demanded. Never was there a more beautiful example of how the majesty of age and wisdom may comport with the obeisance and respect enjoined upon it, as from a lower social rank, and inferior order of endowment, towards a higher. Now, during a conversation of some two or three moments between the Reverend Mr. Dimmesdale and this excellent and hoary-bearded deacon, it was only by the most careful self-control that the former could refrain from uttering certain blasphemous suggestions that rose into his mind, respecting the communion supper. He absolutely trembled and turned pale as ashes, lest his tongue should wag itself, in utterance of these horrible matters, and plead his own consent for so doing, without his having fairly given it. And, even with this terror in his heart, he could hardly avoid laughing, to imagine how the sanctified old patriarchal deacon would have been petrified by his minister’s impiety!\nAgain, another incident of the same nature. Hurrying along the street, the Reverend Mr. Dimmesdale encountered the eldest female member of his church; a most pious and exemplary old dame; poor, widowed, lonely, and with a heart as full of reminiscences about her dead husband and children, and her dead friends of long ago, as a burial-ground is full of storied gravestones. Yet all this, which would else have been such heavy sorrow, was made almost a solemn joy to her devout old soul, by religious consolations and the truths of Scripture, wherewith she had fed herself continually for more than thirty years. And, since Mr. Dimmesdale had taken her in charge, the good grandam’s chief earthly comfort—which, unless it had been likewise a heavenly comfort, could have been none at all—was to meet her pastor, whether casually, or of set purpose, and be refreshed with a word of warm, fragrant, heaven-breathing Gospel truth, from his beloved lips, into her dulled, but rapturously attentive ear. But, on this occasion, up to the moment of putting his lips to the old woman’s ear, Mr. Dimmesdale, as the great enemy of souls would have it, could recall no text of Scripture, nor aught else, except a brief, pithy, and, as it then appeared to him, unanswerable argument against the immortality of the human soul. The instilment thereof into her mind would probably have caused this aged sister to drop down dead, at once, as by the effect of an intensely poisonous infusion. What he really did whisper, the minister could never afterwards recollect. There was, perhaps, a fortunate disorder in his utterance, which failed to impart any distinct idea to the good widow’s comprehension, or which Providence interpreted after a method of its own. Assuredly, as the minister looked back, he beheld an expression of divine gratitude and ecstasy that seemed like the shine of the celestial city on her face, so wrinkled and ashy pale.\nAgain, a third instance. After parting from the old church-member, he met the youngest sister of them all. It was a maiden newly won—and won by the Reverend Mr. Dimmesdale’s own sermon, on the Sabbath after his vigil—to barter the transitory pleasures of the world for the heavenly hope, that was to assume brighter substance as life grew dark around her, and which would gild the utter gloom with final glory. She was fair and pure as a lily that had bloomed in Paradise. The minister knew well that he was himself enshrined within the stainless sanctity of her heart, which hung its snowy curtains about his image, imparting to religion the warmth of love, and to love a religious purity. Satan, that afternoon, had surely led the poor young girl away from her mother’s side, and thrown her into the pathway of this sorely tempted, or—shall we not rather say?—this lost and desperate man. As she drew nigh, the arch-fiend whispered him to condense into small compass and drop into her tender bosom a germ of evil that would be sure to blossom darkly soon, and bear black fruit betimes. Such was his sense of power over this virgin soul, trusting him as she did, that the minister felt potent to blight all the field of innocence with but one wicked look, and develop all its opposite with but a word. So—with a mightier struggle than he had yet sustained—he held his Geneva cloak before his face, and hurried onward, making no sign of recognition, and leaving the young sister to digest his rudeness as she might. She ransacked her conscience,—which was full of harmless little matters, like her pocket or her work-bag,—and took herself to task, poor thing! for a thousand imaginary faults; and went about her household duties with swollen eyelids the next morning.\nBefore the minister had time to celebrate his victory over this last temptation, he was conscious of another impulse, more ludicrous, and almost as horrible. It was,—we blush to tell it,—it was to stop short in the road, and teach some very wicked words to a knot of little Puritan children who were playing there, and had but just begun to talk. Denying himself this freak, as unworthy of his cloth, he met a drunken seaman, one of the ship’s crew from the Spanish Main. And, here, since he had so valiantly forborne all other wickedness, poor Mr. Dimmesdale longed, at least, to shake hands with the tarry blackguard, and recreate himself with a few improper jests, such as dissolute sailors so abound with, and a volley of good, round, solid, satisfactory, and heaven-defying oaths! It was not so much a better principle as partly his natural good taste, and still more his buckramed habit of clerical decorum, that carried him safely through the latter crisis.\n“What is it that haunts and tempts me thus?” cried the minister to himself, at length, pausing in the street, and striking his hand against his forehead. “Am I mad? or am I given over utterly to the fiend? Did I make a contract with him in the forest, and sign it with my blood? And does he now summon me to its fulfilment, by suggesting the performance of every wickedness which his most foul imagination can conceive?”",

            "prefix-probing": "Before Mr. Dimmesdale reached home, his inner man gave him other evidences of a revolution in the sphere of thought and feeling. In the forest, during his interview with Hester, he had been little other than a ghost; a man already in the grave, with only strength enough to haunt the spot where he had enjoyed what little sunshine of happiness was ever to be his. But now, having imbibed the on-coming flood of Hester’s life and passion, and flown with her to the wildest regions of his thought, a sense of immense relief, of a boundless freedom, had gushed from his heart, and taken possession of his whole being. He was now an altered man, and knew it. The brief space since he had parted from Hester Prynne, and set his face towards the town, had been long enough to change a saintly minister, a paragon of Christian orthodoxy, into something very different. It was as if he had been from his youth upward, a very wicked man, who had kept the strictest rules of religion, only for the sake of the exceeding satisfaction produced by every breach of them. He had cast off the iron framework of his life, and was now a law unto himself. And this lawlessness, this wild, electric thrill of liberation, manifested itself in strange and startling ways as he walked along the forest path and then the dusty road towards the settlement. The world, which had hitherto been a place of solemn duties, of prayerful watchfulness, of rigid self-denial, now seemed to him a theatre for wild, capricious impulses. He felt a desire to do some strange, wild, wicked thing, or to say some strange, wild, wicked word, to each person whom he met. It was a giddy, fantastic feeling, as if he had been drinking some powerful intoxicant, or had been suddenly transported into a realm where the old moral laws had no sway. He met a deacon, a venerable character of the church, who, with his silver hair and saintly aspect, was a living type of the purity and sanctity which he himself had always striven to embody. Mr. Dimmesdale felt a sudden, almost irresistible impulse to utter to this holy man a string of blasphemies, such as the wicked sailors who sometimes visited the port might have used. He checked himself, indeed, and passed on, but the impulse had been there, a dark, fiery spark in the depths of his soul. Next, he encountered the oldest female member of his church, a good old dame, who had been a mother to him in his loneliness, and who revered him as if he were an angel on earth. She was suffering from some bodily infirmity, and was leaning on her staff, her face wrinkled with age and sorrow, but beaming with a gentle piety. She stopped him, as was her wont, to speak of the mercies of God and the blessedness of heaven. And what was the minister’s first thought? To whisper in her ear a suggestion that would have made her doubt her Bible, and question the immortality of her soul! He shuddered at himself, and hurried away, leaving the poor old woman bewildered by his abruptness. A little further on, he met a young maiden, one of his own flock, who had been recently converted by his preaching, and who looked up to him with the innocent adoration of a pure heart. She was walking with downcast eyes, meditating, no doubt, on some passage of Scripture. Mr. Dimmesdale felt a wild, unaccountable desire to teach her some wicked, ungodly words, to plant a seed of evil in that virgin soil. He averted his face and passed by quickly, lest the impulse should become too strong for him to resist. Even the children, whom he had always loved and blessed, seemed to him now in a different light. He saw a group of them playing by the roadside, and felt a perverse inclination to join in their sports, but with such a wild, lawless energy as would have terrified their little souls. He wanted to teach them some naughty words, to lead them into some mischief that would have shocked their Puritan parents. He hurried past them, too, with a strange mixture of horror and exhilaration. As he approached the outskirts of the town, he saw a sailor, a rough, sunburnt fellow, who had just come ashore from a ship in the harbor. This man, with his oaths and his swagger, represented a world utterly alien to the minister’s experience. Yet, Mr. Dimmesdale felt a sudden kinship with him, a desire to grasp his hand and exchange some hearty, perhaps even profane, greeting. He felt as if he could have sat down with this man in a tavern, and drunk ale, and listened to his tales of the sea, and felt more at home than he had ever felt in the Governor’s mansion or the meeting-house. He restrained himself, however, and walked on, his heart beating with a strange, new excitement. What did all this mean? Was he going mad? Or was this the effect of the freedom he had just claimed? Was this the consequence of stepping outside the bounds of the moral law, of deciding to flee with"

She made a very grand appearance; having on a high head-dress, a rich gown of velvet, and a ruff done up with the famous yellow starch, of which Ann Turner, her especial friend, had taught her the secret, before this last good lady had been hanged for Sir Thomas Overbury’s murder. Whether the witch had read the minister’s thoughts, or no, she came to a full stop, looked shrewdly into his face, smiled craftily, and—though little given to converse with clergymen—began a conversation.\n“So, reverend Sir, you have made a visit into the forest,” observed the witch-lady, nodding her high head-dress at him. “The next time, I pray you to allow me only a fair warning, and I shall be proud to bear you company. Without taking overmuch upon myself, my good word will go far towards gaining any strange gentleman a fair reception from yonder potentate you wot of!”\n“I profess, madam,” answered the clergyman, with a grave obeisance, such as the lady’s rank demanded, and his own good-breeding made imperative,—“I profess, on my conscience and character, that I am utterly bewildered as touching the purport of your words! I went not into the forest to seek a potentate; neither do I, at any future time, design a visit thither, with a view to gaining the favor of such a personage. My one sufficient object was to greet that pious friend of mine, the Apostle Eliot, and rejoice with him over the many precious souls he hath won from heathendom!”\n“Ha, ha, ha!” cackled the old witch-lady, still nodding her high head-dress at the minister. “Well, well, we must needs talk thus in the daytime! You carry it off like an old hand! But at midnight, and in the forest, we shall have other talk together!”\nShe passed on with her aged stateliness, but often turning back her head and smiling at him, like one willing to recognize a secret intimacy of connection.\n“Have I then sold myself,” thought the minister, “to the fiend whom, if men say true, this yellow-starched and velveted old hag has chosen for her prince and master!”\nThe wretched minister! He had made a bargain very like it! Tempted by a dream of happiness, he had yielded himself, with deliberate choice, as he had never done before, to what he knew was deadly sin. And the infectious poison of that sin had been thus rapidly diffused throughout his moral system. It had stupefied all blessed impulses, and awakened into vivid life the whole brotherhood of bad ones. Scorn, bitterness, unprovoked malignity, gratuitous desire of ill, ridicule of whatever was good and holy, all awoke, to tempt, even while they frightened him. And his encounter with old Mistress Hibbins, if it were a real incident, did but show his sympathy and fellowship with wicked mortals, and the world of perverted spirits.",

She made a very grand appearance; having on a high head-dress, a rich gown of velvet, and a gold chain about her neck, whereby her dress was splendid, without being gaudy. She had a very bright complexion, quite unlike a church-member, and not a little resembled one of the busiest gossips in the market-place, that takes upon herself to distribute the whole budget of scandal. But Mistress Hibbins was of a different order of beings than the grimmest gossip in the whole sisterhood. That night, she had been abroad, and had gathered the freshest news from all quarters in New England. Into this broad highway of the public, she now sallied forth, with all the wild freakishness of a witch, entering upon the world with a laugh. \"So, reverend Sir, you have made a visit into the forest,\" observed the witch-lady, nodding her head to him. \"Pray, what spiritual comfort have you gathered there?\" \"What is your purpose, Mistress Hibbins?\" inquired the clergyman, shuddering, and quickly recovering himself. \"Aha!\" cried the old witch-lady, still nodding her head, and smiling inscrutably. \"Then, worthy Sir, I do profess, as my faith is true, I can tell you what comfort you could have found there. There is a man yonder, dark and wild, that calls himself a friend of mine, who will fly with you to the ends of the earth! Had you looked into his eyes, yet it is too late now, you would have known the comfort you seek. For the forest is the church of the potentate you wot of, and the leaves are his book!

She made a very grand appearance; having on a high head-dress, a rich gown of velvet, and a gold chain about her neck, whereby her dress was splendid, without being gaudy. She had a very bright complexion, quite unlike a church-member, and not a little resembled one of the busiest gossips in the market-place, that takes upon herself to distribute the whole budget of scandal. But Mistress Hibbins was of a different order of beings than the grimmest gossip in the whole sisterhood. That night, she had been abroad, and had gathered the freshest news from all quarters in New England. Into this broad highway of the public, she now sallied forth, with all the wild freakishness of a witch, entering upon the world with a laugh. \"So, reverend Sir, you have made a visit into the forest,\" observed the witch-lady, nodding her head to him. \"Pray, what spiritual comfort have you gathered there?\" \"What is your purpose, Mistress Hibbins?\" inquired the clergyman, shuddering, and quickly recovering himself. \"Aha!\" cried the old witch-lady, still nodding her head, and smiling inscrutably. \"Then, worthy Sir, I do profess, as my faith is true, I can tell you what comfort you could have found there. There is a man yonder, dark and wild, that calls himself a friend of mine, who will fly with you to the ends of the earth! Had you looked into his eyes, yet it is too late now, you would have known the comfort you seek. For the forest is the church of the potentate you wot of, and the leaves are his book! But you have been a good boy, and kept your promise, and come back to us. I know what you would have said, had you dared to say it, and what you have done, had you dared to do it. But you have not dared! And now you are a minister of the gospel again, with a great deal of trouble on your mind, and a great deal of sin on your soul.

The minister was glad to have reached this shelter, without first betraying himself to the world by any of those strange and wicked eccentricities to which he had been continually impelled while passing through the streets. He entered the accustomed room, and looked around him on its books, its windows, its fireplace, and the tapestried comfort of the walls, with the same perception of strangeness that had haunted him throughout his walk from the forest-dell into the town, and thitherward. Here he had studied and written; here, gone through fast and vigil, and come forth half alive; here, striven to pray; here, borne a hundred thousand agonies! There was the Bible, in its rich old Hebrew, with Moses and the Prophets speaking to him, and God’s voice through all! There, on the table, with the inky pen beside it, was an unfinished sermon, with a sentence broken in the midst, where his thoughts had ceased to gush out upon the page, two days before. He knew that it was himself, the thin and white-cheeked minister, who had done and suffered these things, and written thus far into the Election Sermon! But he seemed to stand apart, and eye this former self with scornful, pitying, but half-envious curiosity. That self was gone. Another man had returned out of the forest; a wiser one; with a knowledge of hidden mysteries which the simplicity of the former never could have reached. A bitter kind of knowledge that!\nWhile occupied with these reflections, a knock came at the door of the study, and the minister said, “Come in!”—not wholly devoid of an idea that he might behold an evil spirit. And so he did! It was old Roger Chillingworth that entered. The minister stood, white and speechless, with one hand on the Hebrew Scriptures, and the other spread upon his breast.\n“Welcome home, reverend Sir,” said the physician. “And how found you that godly man, the Apostle Eliot? But methinks, dear Sir, you look pale; as if the travel through the wilderness had been too sore for you. Will not my aid be requisite to put you in heart and strength to preach your Election Sermon?”\n“Nay, I think not so,” rejoined the Reverend Mr. Dimmesdale. “My journey, and the sight of the holy Apostle yonder, and the free air which I have breathed, have done me good, after so long confinement in my study. I think to need no more of your drugs, my kind physician, good though they be, and administered by a friendly hand.”\nAll this time, Roger Chillingworth was looking at the minister with the grave and intent regard of a physician towards his patient. But, in spite of this outward show, the latter was almost convinced of the old man’s knowledge, or, at least, his confident suspicion, with respect to his own interview with Hester Prynne. The physician knew then, that, in the minister’s regard, he was no longer a trusted friend, but his bitterest enemy. So much being known, it would appear natural that a part of it should be expressed. It is singular, however, how long a time often passes before words embody things; and with what security two persons, who choose to avoid a certain subject, may approach its very verge, and retire without disturbing it. Thus, the minister felt no apprehension that Roger Chillingworth would touch, in express words, upon the real position which they sustained towards one another. Yet did the physician, in his dark way, creep frightfully near the secret.",

He wished to avoid any encounter, until the wild effervescence of the moment had subsided, and he could compose himself to look act things with the sober countenance of ordinary life. So he glided to his fireside, and sat down. There, on the table, lay the Election Sermon. It was a work of long thought and elaborate study, of an intricate arrangement, nevertheless cold and lifeless, because it everlastingly lacked the warmth and richness of a well-digested nutriment, or the glow of a melted heart. As the minister looked at it, the idea suddenly came into his mind, that the man who had composed this sermon, five days ago, was not himself. His spirit had grown exceedingly small and sickly, while his heart was all ulcerated, through long agony, and sleepless vigils; and he had lain down on the threshold of the tomb. But this very minister, who had then been on the verge of lunacy, and swooning continually at the sight of his own wretchedness, was now standing in the light, with his right hand on his breast, and smiling, -- at what, had he been conscious of it, he would little have dreamed of smiling at. In a word, old Mr. Dimmesdale, the benighted traveller, coming in from a pilgrimage, had encountered a new minister of the gospel, with whom he was not acquainted. It was himself, but so changed that his mother would not have known him. The moment he touched the pen, in order to begin his Election Sermon, he found it impossible to write.

But, touching your medicine, kind Sir, in my present frame of body, I need it not.”\n“I joy to hear it,” answered the physician. “It may be that my remedies, so long administered in vain, begin now to take due effect.

Thus the night fled away, as if it were a winged steed, and he careering on it; morning came, and peeped, blushing, through the curtains; and at last sunrise threw a golden beam into the study and laid it right across the minister’s bedazzled eyes.

Pray, minister, be careful of your health! Pull away, pull away, my dear friend!”\n\n“Yea, my friend, I pray you, pull away,” replied Dimmesdale. “Look not for me, not wait for me.

Be careful of your health, I say, and let me use my poor skill to-night.”\n\n“I thank you, my friend,” said Dimmesdale, with a solemn smile. “I thank you for your care. But I need it not.

It was already thronged with the craftsmen and other plebeian inhabitants of the town, in considerable numbers; among whom, likewise, were many rough figures, whose attire of deer-skins marked them as belonging to some of the forest settlements, which surrounded the little metropolis of the colony.\nOn this public holiday, as on all other occasions, for seven years past, Hester was clad in a garment of coarse gray cloth. Not more by its hue than by some indescribable peculiarity in its fashion, it had the effect of making her fade personally out of sight and outline; while, again, the scarlet letter brought her back from this twilight indistinctness, and revealed her under the moral aspect of its own illumination. Her face, so long familiar to the towns-people, showed the marble quietude which they were accustomed to behold there. It was like a mask; or, rather, like the frozen calmness of a dead woman’s features; owing this dreary resemblance to the fact that Hester was actually dead, in respect to any claim of sympathy, and had departed out of the world with which she still seemed to mingle.\nIt might be, on this one day, that there was an expression unseen before, nor, indeed, vivid enough to be detected now; unless some preternaturally gifted observer should have first read the heart, and have afterwards sought a corresponding development in the countenance and mien. Such a spiritual seer might have conceived, that, after sustaining the gaze of the multitude through seven miserable years as a necessity, a penance, and something which it was a stern religion to endure, she now, for one last time more, encountered it freely and voluntarily, in order to convert what had so long been agony into a kind of triumph. “Look your last on the scarlet letter and its wearer!”—the people’s victim and life-long bond-slave, as they fancied her, might say to them. “Yet a little while, and she will be beyond your reach! A few hours longer, and the deep, mysterious ocean will quench and hide forever the symbol which ye have caused to burn upon her bosom!” Nor were it an inconsistency too improbable to be assigned to human nature, should we suppose a feeling of regret in Hester’s mind, at the moment when she was about to win her freedom from the pain which had been thus deeply incorporated with her being. Might there not be an irresistible desire to quaff a last, long, breathless draught of the cup of wormwood and aloes, with which nearly all her years of womanhood had been perpetually flavored? The wine of life, henceforth to be presented to her lips, must be indeed rich, delicious, and exhilarating, in its chased and golden beaker; or else leave an inevitable and weary languor, after the lees of bitterness wherewith she had been drugged, as with a cordial of intensest potency.",

The throng was such an unusual and yet customary one, that it seemed an annual event, like a fair, or some stated festival of the church.

But these were ancient matters now, and Hester Prynne had long ago ceased to be a theme of popular talk. So majestic and stately was the presence of this woman, and so much dignity did the scarlet letter confer upon her, that the crowd, instead of scattering, as she came near, stood aside, and gave her room. She wore her customary coarse gray dress, which, in the peculiar fashion of the time, and in its own peculiar style, was of such a nature as to impart to the wearer an appearance of being absorbed into the general grayness of the environment, and of having no individual existence apart from it. But the scarlet letter was there, a sharp and painful object, that seemed to give her a separate existence of pain and ignominy. Her face was still, as it had been for years, a marble-like stillness, which, in its frozen calm, seemed to have little in common with the quick, throbbing life that was around her.

It was a holiday, though unlike any holiday that Hester remembered in the old country. There was no riotous mirth, no wild license of the populace, but a grave and decorous assemblage, albeit with an undercurrent of excitement that stirred the usually placid surface of Puritan life. The grass-plot before the meeting-house was already thronged with people, dressed in their best, though still sombre, attire. Farmers from the surrounding country, with their wives and children, mingled with the townsfolk. There were even a few representatives of the wilder life beyond the settlement's bounds – a group of Native Americans, wrapped in their blankets, observing the scene with impassive curiosity, and some rough-looking mariners from the vessel that lay in the harbour, their faces bronzed by sun and sea. Pearl, with her customary vivacity, was captivated by the unusual spectacle. She pointed at the bright patches of colour – a soldier's sash, the gold embroidery on a magistrate's cloak – and chattered questions to her mother, her voice a clear, bell-like sound amidst the low murmur of the crowd. Hester, however, felt a strange detachment. She stood on the outskirts of the throng, the scarlet letter on her breast a visible barrier between herself and the community. Yet, within her heart, there was a burgeoning hope, a sense of anticipation that was both exhilarating and terrifying. This day was to be the culmination of years of suffering, but also the threshold of a new life. The ship that lay in the harbour was to carry them away, far from the rigid confines of Puritan society, to a place where the scarlet letter might lose its sting. Her eyes scanned the crowd, searching, yet dreading to find, a particular face. The air was thick with expectation, for the highlight of the day was to be the sermon delivered by the Reverend Mr. Dimmesdale, whose health had been failing, but whose spiritual power seemed only to increase with his physical weakness. The people revered him, seeing in his suffering a reflection of their own struggles with sin. Hester knew the true source of his anguish, and the knowledge bound them together in a secret, painful intimacy. As the hour approached for the procession to begin, a hush fell over the market-place. The magistrates, the clergy, and the military men began to assemble, their grave faces reflecting the solemnity of the occasion. Hester watched, her heart pounding, knowing that soon, he would appear."

          "text_segment": "Pearl was decked out with airy gayety. It would have been impossible to guess that this bright and sunny apparition owed its existence to the shape of gloomy gray; or that a fancy, at once so gorgeous and so delicate as must have been requisite to contrive the child’s apparel, was the same that had achieved a task perhaps more difficult, in imparting so distinct a peculiarity to Hester’s simple robe. The dress, so proper was it to little Pearl, seemed an effluence, or inevitable development and outward manifestation of her character, no more to be separated from her than the many-hued brilliancy from a butterfly’s wing, or the painted glory from the leaf of a bright flower. As with these, so with the child; her garb was all of one idea with her nature. On this eventful day, moreover, there was a certain singular inquietude and excitement in her mood, resembling nothing so much as the shimmer of a diamond, that sparkles and flashes with the varied throbbings of the breast on which it is displayed. Children have always a sympathy in the agitations of those connected with them; always, especially, a sense of any trouble or impending revolution, of whatever kind, in domestic circumstances; and therefore Pearl, who was the gem on her mother’s unquiet bosom, betrayed, by the very dance of her spirits, the emotions which none could detect in the marble passiveness of Hester’s brow.\nThis effervescence made her flit with a bird-like movement, rather than walk by her mother’s side. She broke continually into shouts of a wild, inarticulate, and sometimes piercing music. When they reached the market-place, she became still more restless, on perceiving the stir and bustle that enlivened the spot; for it was usually more like the broad and lonesome green before a village meeting-house, than the centre of a town’s business.\n“Why, what is this, mother?” cried she. “Wherefore have all the people left their work to-day? Is it a play-day for the whole world? See, there is the blacksmith! He has washed his sooty face, and put on his Sabbath-day clothes, and looks as if he would gladly be merry, if any kind body would only teach him how! And there is Master Brackett, the old jailer, nodding and smiling at me. Why does he do so, mother?”\n“He remembers thee a little babe, my child,” answered Hester.\n“He should not nod and smile at me, for all that,—the black, grim, ugly-eyed old man!” said Pearl. “He may nod at thee, if he will; for thou art clad in gray, and wearest the scarlet letter. But see, mother, how many faces of strange people, and Indians among them, and sailors! What have they all come to do, here in the market-place?”\n“They wait to see the procession pass,” said Hester. “For the Governor and the magistrates are to go by, and the ministers, and all the great people and good people, with the music and the soldiers marching before them.”\n“And will the minister be there?” asked Pearl. “And will he hold out both his hands to me, as when thou ledst me to him from the brook-side?”\n“He will be there, child,” answered her mother. “But he will not greet thee to-day; nor must thou greet him.”\n“What a strange, sad man is he!” said the child, as if speaking partly to herself. “In the dark night-time he calls us to him, and holds thy hand and mine, as when we stood with him on the scaffold yonder. And in the deep forest, where only the old trees can hear, and the strip of sky see it, he talks with thee, sitting on a heap of moss! And he kisses my forehead, too, so that the little brook would hardly wash it off! But here, in the sunny day, and among all the people, he knows us not; nor must we know him! A strange, sad man is he, with his hand always over his heart!”\n“Be quiet, Pearl! Thou understandest not these things,” said her mother. “Think not now of the minister, but look about thee, and see how cheery is everybody’s face to-day. The children have come from their schools, and the grown people from their workshops and their fields, on purpose to be happy. For, to-day, a new man is beginning to rule over them; and so—as has been the custom of mankind ever since a nation was first gathered—they make merry and rejoice; as if a good and golden year were at length to pass over the poor old world!”",

Her mother, by the bye, had arrayed her in a crimson velvet tunic, richly embroidered with gold thread, the most splendid garment that the poor woman had produced, and which was worthy to have been worn by the Governor's daughter, when they were presented at court. When Pearl was thus arrayed, she gleamed with an ethereal radiance, which, taken with the vivacious stir of her spirit, made her seem like a bright flower, or a bird of paradise, in the gloomiest of tropical woods. But with all this radiance, there was a wholesome tang of the wildness of her nature. She was a living picture of the scarlet letter. And yet, as Hester looked at her, with an anxious smile, she felt that there was little hope of bringing her child into sympathy with the sober earnestness of her own spirit. Pearl was a child of the forest, a child of nature, and she would not be tamed. On this particular day, there was an unusual agitation in her mood. She was restless, excited, and full of a wild, inarticulate joy. It was as if she had caught the contagion of the general mirth, and was giving it back in her own way. Children are so sensitive to the atmosphere of feeling that is diffused about them. They catch the tone of their parents' mood, and give it back in their own way. Pearl's vivacity was but the reflection of the hidden excitement of her mother. As they walked along, Pearl did not walk sedately, but darted hither and thither, like a bird on the wing. She would stop to pick up a pebble, or a flower, or a feather, and then dart on again, with a wild, inarticulate cry. When they reached the market-place, her restlessness increased. She looked about her with a wild, eager gaze. \"Mother,\" she said, \"why are all these people idle? Why do they not work?\" \"It is a holiday, child,\" said Hester. \"It is the day when the new Governor is to be installed. There is to be a procession, and a feast, and games.\" \"Oh, a holiday!\" cried Pearl. \"That is why the blacksmith is dressed in his best clothes, and has a flower in his button-hole. And that is why old Master Brackett, the jailer, smiled at me. Did you see him, Mother? He smiled at me, as if he knew me.\" \"Yes, child,\" said Hester. \"He remembers you, when you were a baby. He used to carry you in his arms.\" \"I do not like him to smile at me,\" said Pearl. \"He is a grim old man. And who are all these other people, Mother? There are Indians, and sailors, and people from the country. What are they all doing here?\" \"They are waiting for the procession, child,\" said Hester. \"The Governor, and the magistrates, and the ministers, and all the great people are coming this way.\" \"Will the minister be there?\" asked Pearl. \"Will he be in the procession?\" \"Yes, child,\" said Hester. \"He will be there.\" \"And will he speak to me?\" asked Pearl. \"Will he take my hand, and smile at me, as he did by the brook-side?\" \"No, child,\" said Hester. \"He will not speak to us. We must not speak to him.\" \"Why not?\" asked Pearl. \"He spoke to us by the brook-side. He took my hand, and smiled at me. Why will he not speak to us now?\" \"He is a public man, now, child,\" said Hester. \"He is in the midst of the people. He cannot speak to us now.\" \"He is a strange, sad man, Mother,\" said Pearl. \"He puts his hand over his heart, and he looks sad. Why does he do so?\" \"I do not know, child,\" said Hester. \"You are too young to understand such things. Look at the people, and the holiday. Be cheerful, and happy, as they are.\" \"But why does he not speak to us?\" persisted Pearl. \"He spoke to us by the brook-side. He took my hand, and smiled at me. Why will he not speak to us now?\" \"Do not ask me, child,\" said Hester. \"I cannot tell you. Look at the people, and the holiday. Be cheerful, and happy, as they are. It is a holiday, and the people are happy. They are celebrating the new Governor, and the prosperity of the colony. Be happy with them, child.\" Pearl looked at the people, and the holiday. She saw the cheerful faces, and the festive attire. She heard the sounds of mirth and revelry. But she did not seem to be happy. She was still restless, and agitated. She looked at her mother, with a strange, questioning look. \"Mother,\" she said, \"what is the matter? Why are you so sad?\" \"I am not sad, child,\" said Hester. \"I am happy. It is a holiday, and I am happy.\" But her voice trembled, and her eyes were full of tears. Pearl looked at her mother, and then at the people. She did not understand. She was a child of nature, and she did not understand the ways of men. She was a living picture of the scarlet letter, and she did not understand the meaning of it.",

            "prefix-probing": "Pearl was decked out with airy gayety. Her mother, Hester Prynne, had lavished upon her the richest and most fantastic adornment, bestowing upon her child the sum of that gorgeous splendor which she might otherwise have wasted upon the now hateful scarlet letter. Pearl’s attire was never of the somber hue and plain cut that befitted the children of the Puritan settlement. Instead, she was a living gem, clad in fabrics of crimson and gold, embroidered with intricate patterns that spoke of a wild, untamed beauty. Hester’s needle, so skilled in creating the infamous letter, found its truest joy and expression in decking out her daughter. Pearl’s little cap was often adorned with feathers, her dress trimmed with lace and ribbon, her tiny shoes perhaps of gilded leather – a spectacle that drew the eye and whispered of forbidden things in the stern, grey world of Boston. This outward brilliance was but a reflection of the child’s inner nature. She was not merely dressed in gayety; she embodied it. Her movements were quick and light, like a bird flitting from branch to branch, or a sunbeam dancing on the water. She could not stand still for long, her energy boundless, her spirit restless. When she ran, it was with a speed and grace that seemed almost supernatural, her laughter ringing out like a chime in the quiet streets, a sound so rare and bright that it startled the sober townsfolk. Pearl was a creature of impulse, guided by whims and fancies that had no root in the conventional rules of human society. She spoke her mind with startling directness, often asking questions that pierced to the heart of matters adults sought to conceal. Her eyes, dark and deep, seemed to see more than was visible to others, discerning the hidden truths and hypocrisies around her. She had no playmates among the Puritan children, for they instinctively shrank from her, sensing the strangeness that clung to her like the scent of the forest. And indeed, the forest was her truest companion. She roamed its paths with fearless delight, conversing with the trees and the animals, weaving garlands of wildflowers, and chasing butterflies. In this wild setting, her airy gayety seemed most natural, most at home. She was a part of the wilderness, as untamed and unpredictable as the wind itself. Hester watched her with a mixture of love, awe, and fear. Pearl was her only joy, the one bright spot in her shadowed existence, yet she was also a constant reminder of her sin, a living, breathing scarlet letter. The child’s moods could shift like the weather – one moment full of sunshine and laughter, the next clouded with a strange, unsettling intensity. She would sometimes torment her mother with pointed questions about the scarlet letter, or mimic the gestures of the stern magistrates, her childish play imbued with a disturbing insight into the adult world. Her imagination was vivid and powerful. She created imaginary friends out of sticks and rags, but her favorite plaything was the scarlet letter itself. She would arrange pebbles or wildflowers to form the shape of the 'A', or insist that Hester tell her stories about it. This fascination with the symbol of her mother’s shame was both heartbreaking and deeply symbolic. Pearl was the consequence of the sin, and she seemed determined to understand its meaning, to force her mother to confront it fully. Her airy gayety, therefore, was not merely childish innocence; it was the effervescence of a spirit that had been born outside the bounds of conventional morality, a spirit that was wild, free, and deeply perceptive. She was a sprite, an elf-child, a creature of the elements, embodying the passion and defiance that Hester had been forced to suppress. In her bright attire and her unrestrained movements, Pearl was a living protest against the drab conformity of Puritan life, a vibrant splash of color in a world of grey, a constant, challenging presence that forced those around her to confront the complexities of sin, guilt, and redemption. Her very existence, so full of light and movement, was a question mark posed to the rigid doctrines of the community, a testament to the enduring power of nature and the human heart to defy the constraints placed upon them."

          "text_segment": "It was as Hester said, in regard to the unwonted jollity that brightened the faces of the people. Into this festal season of the year—as it already was, and continued to be during the greater part of two centuries—the Puritans compressed whatever mirth and public joy they deemed allowable to human infirmity; thereby so far dispelling the customary cloud, that, for the space of a single holiday, they appeared scarcely more grave than most other communities at a period of general affliction.\nBut we perhaps exaggerate the gray or sable tinge, which undoubtedly characterized the mood and manners of the age. The persons now in the market-place of Boston had not been born to an inheritance of Puritanic gloom. They were native Englishmen, whose fathers had lived in the sunny richness of the Elizabethan epoch; a time when the life of England, viewed as one great mass, would appear to have been as stately, magnificent, and joyous, as the world has ever witnessed. Had they followed their hereditary taste, the New England settlers would have illustrated all events of public importance by bonfires, banquets, pageantries, and processions. Nor would it have been impracticable, in the observance of majestic ceremonies, to combine mirthful recreation with solemnity, and give, as it were, a grotesque and brilliant embroidery to the great robe of state, which a nation, at such festivals, puts on. There was some shadow of an attempt of this kind in the mode of celebrating the day on which the political year of the colony commenced. The dim reflection of a remembered splendor, a colorless and manifold diluted repetition of what they had beheld in proud old London,—we will not say at a royal coronation, but at a Lord Mayor’s show,—might be traced in the customs which our forefathers instituted, with reference to the annual installation of magistrates. The fathers and founders of the commonwealth—the statesman, the priest, and the soldier—deemed it a duty then to assume the outward state and majesty, which, in accordance with antique style, was looked upon as the proper garb of public or social eminence. All came forth, to move in procession before the people’s eye, and thus impart a needed dignity to the simple framework of a government so newly constructed.\nThen, too, the people were countenanced, if not encouraged, in relaxing the severe and close application to their various modes of rugged industry, which, at all other times, seemed of the same piece and material with their religion. Here, it is true, were none of the applicances which popular merriment would so readily have found in the England of Elizabeth’s time, or that of James;—no rude shows of a theatrical kind; no minstrel, with his harp and legendary ballad, nor gleeman, with an ape dancing to his music; no juggler, with his tricks of mimic witchcraft; no Merry Andrew, to stir up the multitude with jests, perhaps hundreds of years old, but still effective, by their appeals to the very broadest sources of mirthful sympathy. All such professors of the several branches of jocularity would have been sternly repressed, not only by the rigid discipline of law, but by the general sentiment which gives law its vitality. Not the less, however, the great, honest face of the people smiled, grimly, perhaps, but widely too. Nor were sports wanting, such as the colonists had witnessed, and shared in, long ago, at the country fairs and on the village-greens of England; and which it was thought well to keep alive on this new soil, for the sake of the courage and manliness that were essential in them. Wrestling-matches, in the different fashions of Cornwall and Devonshire, were seen here and there about the market-place; in one corner, there was a friendly bout at quarterstaff; and—what attracted most interest of all—on the platform of the pillory, already so noted in our pages, two masters of defence were commencing an exhibition with the buckler and broadsword. But, much to the disappointment of the crowd, this latter business was broken off by the interposition of the town beadle, who had no idea of permitting the majesty of the law to be violated by such an abuse of one of its consecrated places.\nIt may not be too much to affirm, on the whole, (the people being then in the first stages of joyless deportment, and the offspring of sires who had known how to be merry, in their day,) that they would compare favorably, in point of holiday keeping, with their descendants, even at so long an interval as ourselves. Their immediate posterity, the generation next to the early emigrants, wore the blackest shade of Puritanism, and so darkened the national visage with it, that all the subsequent years have not sufficed to clear it up. We have yet to learn again the forgotten art of gayety.",

A party of Indians—in their savage finery of curiously embroidered deer-skin robes, wampum-belts, red and yellow ochre, and feathers, and armed with the bow and arrow and stone-headed spear—stood apart, with countenances of inflexible gravity, beyond what even the Puritan aspect could attain. Nor, wild as were these painted barbarians, were they the wildest feature of the scene. This distinction could more justly be claimed by some mariners,—a part of the crew of the vessel from the Spanish Main,—who had come ashore to see the humors of Election Day. They were rough-looking desperadoes, with sun-blackened faces, and an immensity of beard; their wide, short trousers were confined about the waist by belts, often clasped with a rough plate of gold, and sustaining always a long knife, and, in some instances, a sword. From beneath their broad-brimmed hats of palm-leaf gleamed eyes which, even in good-nature and merriment, had a kind of animal ferocity. They transgressed, without fear or scruple, the rules of behavior that were binding on all others; smoking tobacco under the beadle’s very nose, although each whiff would have cost a townsman a shilling; and quaffing, at their pleasure, draughts of wine or aqua-vitæ from pocket-flasks, which they freely tendered to the gaping crowd around them. It remarkably characterized the incomplete morality of the age, rigid as we call it, that a license was allowed the seafaring class, not merely for their freaks on shore, but for far more desperate deeds on their proper element. The sailor of that day would go near to be arraigned as a pirate in our own. There could be little doubt, for instance, that this very ship’s crew, though no unfavorable specimens of the nautical brotherhood, had been guilty, as we should phrase it, of depredations on the Spanish commerce, such as would have perilled all their necks in a modern court of justice.\nBut the sea, in those old times, heaved, swelled, and foamed, very much at its own will, or subject only to the tempestuous wind, with hardly any attempts at regulation by human law. The buccaneer on the wave might relinquish his calling, and become at once, if he chose, a man of probity and piety on land; nor, even in the full career of his reckless life, was he regarded as a personage with whom it was disreputable to traffic, or casually associate. Thus, the Puritan elders, in their black cloaks, starched bands, and steeple-crowned hats, smiled not unbenignantly at the clamor and rude deportment of these jolly seafaring men; and it excited neither surprise nor animadversion, when so reputable a citizen as old Roger Chillingworth, the physician, was seen to enter the market-place, in close and familiar talk with the commander of the questionable vessel.",

He wore a profusion of ribbons on his garment, and gold-lace on his hat, which was also encircled by a gold chain, and surmounted with a feather. There was a sword at his side, and a sword-cut on his forehead, which, by the arrangement of his hair, he seemed anxious rather to display than hide. A landsman could hardly have worn this garb and shown this face, and worn and shown them both with such a galliard air, without undergoing stern question before a magistrate, and probably incurring fine or imprisonment, or perhaps an exhibition in the stocks. As regarded the shipmaster, however, all was looked upon as pertaining to the character, as to a fish his glistening scales.\nAfter parting from the physician, the commander of the Bristol ship strolled idly through the market-place; until, happening to approach the spot where Hester Prynne was standing, he appeared to recognize, and did not hesitate to address her. As was usually the case wherever Hester stood, a small vacant area—a sort of magic circle—had formed itself about her, into which, though the people were elbowing one another at a little distance, none ventured, or felt disposed to intrude. It was a forcible type of the moral solitude in which the scarlet letter enveloped its fated wearer; partly by her own reserve, and partly by the instinctive, though no longer so unkindly, withdrawal of her fellow-creatures. Now, if never before, it answered a good purpose, by enabling Hester and the seaman to speak together without risk of being overheard; and so changed was Hester Prynne’s repute before the public, that the matron in town most eminent for rigid morality could not have held such intercourse with less result of scandal than herself.\n“So, mistress,” said the mariner, “I must bid the steward make ready one more berth than you bargained for! No fear of scurvy or ship-fever, this voyage! What with the ship’s surgeon and this other doctor, our only danger will be from drug or pill; more by token, as there is a lot of apothecary’s stuff aboard, which I traded for with a Spanish vessel.”\n“What mean you?” inquired Hester, startled more than she permitted to appear. “Have you another passenger?”\n“Why, know you not,” cried the shipmaster, “that this physician here—Chillingworth, he calls himself—is minded to try my cabin-fare with you? Ay, ay, you must have known it; for he tells me he is of your party, and a close friend to the gentleman you spoke of,—he that is in peril from these sour old Puritan rulers!”\n“They know each other well, indeed,” replied Hester, with a mien of calmness, though in the utmost consternation. “They have long dwelt together.”\nNothing further passed between the mariner and Hester Prynne. But, at that instant, she beheld old Roger Chillingworth himself, standing in the remotest corner of the market-place, and smiling on her; a smile which—across the wide and bustling square, and through all the talk and laughter, and various thoughts, moods, and interests of the crowd—conveyed secret and fearful meaning.",

          "text_segment": "BEFORE Hester Prynne could call together her thoughts, and consider what was practicable to be done in this new and startling aspect of affairs, the sound of military music was heard approaching along a contiguous street. It denoted the advance of the procession of magistrates and citizens, on its way towards the meeting-house; where, in compliance with a custom thus early established, and ever since observed, the Reverend Mr. Dimmesdale was to deliver an Election Sermon.\nSoon the head of the procession showed itself, with a slow and stately march, turning a corner, and making its way across the market-place. First came the music. It comprised a variety of instruments, perhaps imperfectly adapted to one another, and played with no great skill; but yet attaining the great object for which the harmony of drum and clarion addresses itself to the multitude,—that of imparting a higher and more heroic air to the scene of life that passes before the eye. Little Pearl at first clapped her hands, but then lost, for an instant, the restless agitation that had kept her in a continual effervescence throughout the morning; she gazed silently, and seemed to be borne upward, like a floating sea-bird, on the long heaves and swells of sound. But she was brought back to her former mood by the shimmer of the sunshine on the weapons and bright armor of the military company, which followed after the music, and formed the honorary escort of the procession. This body of soldiery—which still sustains a corporate existence, and marches down from past ages with an ancient and honorable fame—was composed of no mercenary materials. Its ranks were filled with gentlemen, who felt the stirrings of martial impulse, and sought to establish a kind of College of Arms, where, as in an association of Knights Templars, they might learn the science, and, so far as peaceful exercise would teach them, the practices of war. The high estimation then placed upon the military character might be seen in the lofty port of each individual member of the company. Some of them, indeed, by their services in the Low Countries and on other fields of European warfare, had fairly won their title to assume the name and pomp of soldiership. The entire array, moreover, clad in burnished steel, and with plumage nodding over their bright morions, had a brilliancy of effect which no modern display can aspire to equal.",

It heralded the procession of magistrates and citizens, on its way to the meeting-house. A guard of military men, in puffed and embroidered garments, and armed with halberds, shouldered the throng, making a lane for the chief personages of the colony. Nothing impressed the populace so profoundly as this pomp and ceremonial of authority. The people were gloomy in their religious sentiment, of course, but looked forward to the Election Sermon as a holiday, and were prepared to enjoy themselves with the utmost rigor, so far as enjoyment might be compatible with the strictest order. The procession was led by a band of musicians, who might not rightly be termed a band of musicians, because there were only two;--one a trumpet, and the other a drum. The trumpet could only produce a few martial notes, after the fashion of a highland pipe, but played them with the utmost force and bravura. The drum, in like manner, was but a single drum, yet gave forth as lusty a roar as if a whole park of artillery were rattling its carriages over the stones. These two instruments, however, were sufficient to awaken so much martial pomp in the bosoms of the people, that they felt happy to be poor soldiers of King Charles. They were accompanied by a body of halberdiers, who were so proud of their office, that they seemed to tread on air. Pearl, who was standing beside Hester, clapped her hands, and gave a little shout of delight.

Even in outward demeanor, they showed a stamp of majesty that made the warrior’s haughty stride look vulgar, if not absurd. It was an age when what we call talent had far less consideration than now, but the massive materials which produce stability and dignity of character a great deal more. The people possessed, by hereditary right, the quality of reverence; which, in their descendants, if it survive at all, exists in smaller proportion, and with a vastly diminished force, in the selection and estimate of public men. The change may be for good or ill, and is partly, perhaps, for both. In that old day, the English settler on these rude shores—having left king, nobles, and all degrees of awful rank behind, while still the faculty and necessity of reverence were strong in him—bestowed it on the white hair and venerable brow of age; on long-tried integrity; on solid wisdom and sad-colored experience; on endowments of that grave and weighty order which gives the idea of permanence, and comes under the general definition of respectability. These primitive statesmen, therefore,—Bradstreet, Endicott, Dudley, Bellingham, and their compeers,—who were elevated to power by the early choice of the people, seem to have been not often brilliant, but distinguished by a ponderous sobriety, rather than activity of intellect. They had fortitude and self-reliance, and, in time of difficulty or peril, stood up for the welfare of the state like a line of cliffs against a tempestuous tide. The traits of character here indicated were well represented in the square cast of countenance and large physical development of the new colonial magistrates. So far as a demeanor of natural authority was concerned, the mother country need not have been ashamed to see these foremost men of an actual democracy adopted into the House of Peers, or made the Privy Council of the sovereign.",

Even in outward demeanour, they were so deeply marked with gravity and stately decorum, that you would at once and with little difficulty have distinguished them from the military talents, who pranced and strutted before them. They were, in truth, the men of that era, who, being now in the decline of life, had grown grey in the service of the colony, holding here and there an office of public trust, and possessing, in their own persons, the character of the times; which was, in truth, a character of stability, rather than of brilliancy. The age had not then, as now, a fastidious demand for brilliancy of intellect, but it was content with a solid and dignified character, which was, in truth, the most valuable quality in the world. The populace, moreover, then possessed a hereditary reverence, which they transmitted to their children, and which, in the estimation of their descendants, has been greatly diminished. Whether this change be for good or evil, is a question which it is not easy to answer. The early English settlers, who had been accustomed to a monarchy, and who had not yet lost their reverence for authority, transferred it to the aged wisdom, the proven integrity, and the solemn experience of their rulers. These were the men, who, being chosen by the people, were the most fit to govern them. They were not men of brilliant intellect, but they were men of weighty seriousness, calm, thoughtful, and with a stolid self-possession, both for good and evil. They were men who had been tried in the furnace of affliction, and who had come forth as gold. They were men who had defended the state with their lives, and who had been found faithful in all things. Their faces were stern, and their forms were robust, and they had a natural air of authority, which would have made them fit for the highest offices in the mother country.\n```",

This missing section removes the initial comparison that frames the rest of the passage.\n- The completion also lacks the concluding reflection on how these leaders would have been viewed by the mother country, which is a significant closing thought in the original.\n\n2. MISSING ELEMENTS:\n- There is no mention of the outward demeanor or the sense of majesty attributed to the civil leaders, which is a key observation early in the passage.\n- The completion does not include any discussion of the era's values regarding talent versus character, nor does it reference the hereditary quality of reverence among the people.\n- The passage omits the historical context about the English settlers and their transfer of reverence to new forms of authority in the colonies.\n- The specific examples of the early statesmen and their qualities are missing, as well as the description of their physical appearance and the metaphor comparing them to cliffs.\n\n3. INACCURATE ELEMENTS:\n- The completion introduces a general description of seriousness and self-possession, but does not accurately reflect the sequence or depth of the original character analysis.\n- There is a lack of progression from societal values to individual traits, which is present in the original passage.\n- The completion does not maintain the original order of ideas, moving directly to a vague summary without the supporting details and context provided in the source."

His was the profession, at that era, in which intellectual ability displayed itself far more than in political life; for—leaving a higher motive out of the question—it offered inducements powerful enough, in the almost worshipping respect of the community, to win the most aspiring ambition into its service. Even political power—as in the case of Increase Mather—was within the grasp of a successful priest.\nIt was the observation of those who beheld him now, that never, since Mr. Dimmesdale first set his foot on the New England shore, had he exhibited such energy as was seen in the gait and air with which he kept his pace in the procession. There was no feebleness of step, as at other times; his frame was not bent; nor did his hand rest ominously upon his heart. Yet, if the clergyman were rightly viewed, his strength seemed not of the body. It might be spiritual, and imparted to him by angelic ministrations. It might be the exhilaration of that potent cordial, which is distilled only in the furnace-glow of earnest and long-continued thought. Or, perchance, his sensitive temperament was invigorated by the loud and piercing music, that swelled heavenward, and uplifted him on its ascending wave. Nevertheless, so abstracted was his look, it might be questioned whether Mr. Dimmesdale even heard the music. There was his body, moving onward, and with an unaccustomed force. But where was his mind? Far and deep in its own region, busying itself, with preternatural activity, to marshal a procession of stately thoughts that were soon to issue thence; and so he saw nothing, heard nothing, knew nothing, of what was around him; but the spiritual element took up the feeble frame, and carried it along, unconscious of the burden, and converting it to spirit like itself. Men of uncommon intellect, who have grown morbid, possess this occasional power of mighty effort, into which they throw the life of many days, and then are lifeless for as many more.",

There are some little Puritans at play in the market-place.  Go thou and sport with them.”  “No, mother,” said Pearl.  “I like not the Puritans.  They are stern and sad.  I will not play with them.  Come, mother, let us go home.”  “Not yet, little Pearl,” said Hester.  “I have a little business to do, and then we will go home.”  While Hester stood talking with Pearl, she was aware of a movement in the crowd, and turning, she saw the Indian chief, who had been standing near her, making signs to her.  She went to him, and he spoke to her in a low voice, through the interpreter.  “I have a message from the minister, to the woman with the scarlet letter,” said the interpreter.  “He bids me say, that he will meet her at the ship, and that she is not to be troubled about the matter of the ship, for he has arranged it all.”  Hester bowed her head in assent, and the Indian chief, with his interpreter, moved away.  Hester returned to Pearl, and they stood together, watching the crowd.  “Mother,” said Pearl, “what did the Indian say to you?”  “He said that the minister would meet us at the ship,” answered Hester.  “And what did he say about the ship?” asked Pearl.  “He said that he had arranged it all,” answered Hester.  “And what did he say about the scarlet letter?” asked Pearl.  “He said nothing about the scarlet letter,” answered Hester.  “Then, mother,” said Pearl, “I do not like the minister.

While the procession was încă passing, she was uneasy, restless, the grotesqueness of a little elf, at play and gleaming in a sunbeam, she looked so strange and ethereal, and as if she would vanish into air.  As soon as it went by, she turned to her mother, and looked into her face, with an inquisitive smile.  “Mother,” said she, “was that the same minister that kissed me by the brook?”  “Hold thy peace, dear little Pearl!” whispered Hester.  “We must not always talk in the market-place of what happens to us in the forest.”  “I could not be sure that it was he; so strange he looked!” remarked Pearl.  “If I might have stood beside thee, mother, I would have taken hold of his hand, and asked him at once, what was the matter with him.  Nay, mother, I should have asked him for some of his white gloves, or pretty handkerchiefs, and he would probably have given me them.  Yes, and I’ve seen such white gloves and pretty handkerchiefs in the minister’s study, mother!  And little Pearl would be so glad!  Oh, mother, will you ask him to give me some?”  “No, my little Pearl!” said Hester.  “He has all he can do to keep the ruffles of his shirt-bosom to himself, and little children are not to be rude to him.”  “Then, what was the minister doing with his hand always on his heart?” inquired Pearl.  “It is a strange thing, mother, but when I was a baby, and wore a scarlet letter on my bosom, I used to be continually playing with it.  And so did the minister with his hand on his heart.  I have seen him do it, now and then, ever since I was a baby.  It is as if he had a scarlet letter of his own upon his bosom.  Would it not be funny, mother?”  “No, child.  It is not to be sported with,” answered Hester.  “Little Pearl, when thou art ten years old, I will tell thee what it means.”  “Why not now, mother?” asked Pearl.  “Because I know not myself,” answered Hester, sorrowing greatly.  “And now, little Pearl, go and play with the other children.

It was as if he were a being of mist, visible yet untouchable, a figure woven from the same ethereal substance as the sunshine she chased or the shadows she played in. Her quick, intuitive spirit, unburdened by the world's hypocrisies, could not grasp the artificial barrier that separated him from them. She would gaze at him with that strange, penetrating earnestness, sometimes reaching out a small hand as if to test his reality, only to withdraw it when the expected warmth or solidity was absent. He was a puzzle to her, a man who seemed to belong to the same world as her mother and herself, yet was perpetually held apart by some invisible, potent spell. This mystery, this unresolved question mark in the landscape of her young life, often manifested in her capricious moods and wild, untamed behavior. She was the living embodiment of the truth that Dimmesdale so desperately concealed, and her very presence was a constant, silent interrogation of his hidden self. He could not meet her gaze, for in those innocent, knowing eyes, he saw the reflection of his own guilt and the stark, unvarnished reality he dared not confront. She was the scarlet letter made flesh, a constant reminder of the bond he denied."

It was Mistress Hibbins, who, arrayed in great magnificence, with a triple ruff, a broidered stomacher, a gown of rich velvet, and a gold-headed cane, had come forth to see the procession. As this ancient lady had the renown (which subsequently cost her no less a price than her life) of being a principal actor in all the works of necromancy that were continually going forward, the crowd gave way before her, and seemed to fear the touch of her garment, as if it carried the plague among its gorgeous folds. Seen in conjunction with Hester Prynne,—kindly as so many now felt towards the latter,—the dread inspired by Mistress Hibbins was doubled, and caused a general movement from that part of the market-place in which the two women stood.\n“Now, what mortal imagination could conceive it!” whispered the old lady, confidentially, to Hester. “Yonder divine man! That saint on earth, as the people uphold him to be, and as—I must needs say—he really looks! Who, now, that saw him pass in the procession, would think how little while it is since he went forth out of his study,—chewing a Hebrew text of Scripture in his mouth, I warrant,—to take an airing in the forest! Aha! we know what that means, Hester Prynne! But, truly, forsooth, I find it hard to believe him the same man. Many a church-member saw I, walking behind the music, that has danced in the same measure with me, when Somebody was fiddler, and, it might be, an Indian powwow or a Lapland wizard changing hands with us! That is but a trifle, when a woman knows the world. But this minister! Couldst thou surely tell, Hester, whether he was the same man that encountered thee on the forest-path?”\n“Madam, I know not of what you speak,” answered Hester Prynne, feeling Mistress Hibbins to be of infirm mind; yet strangely startled and awe-stricken by the confidence with which she affirmed a personal connection between so many persons (herself among them) and the Evil One. “It is not for me to talk lightly of a learned and pious minister of the Word, like the Reverend Mr. Dimmesdale!”\n“Fie, woman, fie!” cried the old lady, shaking her finger at Hester. “Dost thou think I have been to the forest so many times, and have yet no skill to judge who else has been there? Yea; though no leaf of the wild garlands, which they wore while they danced, be left in their hair! I know thee, Hester; for I behold the token. We may all see it in the sunshine; and it glows like a red flame in the dark. Thou wearest it openly; so there need be no question about that. But this minister! Let me tell thee, in thine ear! When the Black Man sees one of his own servants, signed and sealed, so shy of owning to the bond as is the Reverend Mr. Dimmesdale, he hath a way of ordering matters so that the mark shall be disclosed in open daylight to the eyes of all the world! What is it that the minister seeks to hide, with his hand always over his heart? Ha, Hester Prynne!”\n“What is it, good Mistress Hibbins?” eagerly asked little Pearl. “Hast thou seen it?”\n“No matter, darling!” responded Mistress Hibbins, making Pearl a profound reverence. “Thou thyself wilt see it, one time or another. They say, child, thou art of the lineage of the Prince of the Air! Wilt thou ride with me, some fine night, to see thy father? Then thou shalt know wherefore the minister keeps his hand over his heart!”\nLaughing so shrilly that all the market-place could hear her, the weird old gentlewoman took her departure.",

There was a woman with him, and a little child. And I knew the child, for it was Pearl! And I knew the woman, for she wore the scarlet letter!\" \"You are raving, Mistress Hibbins!\" cried Hester, with a look of horror. \"I have been in the forest, it is true, but not with Mr. Dimmesdale. And I have been there with Pearl, but not with Mr. Dimmesdale. And Mr. Dimmesdale has been there, I doubt not, but not with me!\" \"Look you, Mistress Prynne,\" said the old dame, fixing her eyes on Hester's face, \"I promise you, that, some day or other, you will be bold enough to wear the scarlet letter openly, and not in your bosom.

An irresistible feeling kept Hester near the spot. As the sacred edifice was too much thronged to admit another auditor, she took up her position close beside the scaffold of the pillory. It was in sufficient proximity to bring the whole sermon to her ears, in the shape of an indistinct, but varied, murmur and flow of the minister’s very peculiar voice.\nThis vocal organ was in itself a rich endowment; insomuch that a listener, comprehending nothing of the language in which the preacher spoke, might still have been swayed to and fro by the mere tone and cadence. Like all other music, it breathed passion and pathos, and emotions high or tender, in a tongue native to the human heart, wherever educated. Muffled as the sound was by its passage through the church-walls, Hester Prynne listened with such intentness, and sympathized so intimately, that the sermon had throughout a meaning for her, entirely apart from its indistinguishable words. These, perhaps, if more distinctly heard, might have been only a grosser medium, and have clogged the spiritual sense. Now she caught the low undertone, as of the wind sinking down to repose itself; then ascended with it, as it rose through progressive gradations of sweetness and power, until its volume seemed to envelop her with an atmosphere of awe and solemn grandeur. And yet, majestic as the voice sometimes became, there was forever in it an essential character of plaintiveness. A loud or low expression of anguish,—the whisper, or the shriek, as it might be conceived, of suffering humanity, that touched a sensibility in every bosom! At times this deep strain of pathos was all that could be heard, and scarcely heard, sighing amid a desolate silence. But even when the minister’s voice grew high and commanding,—when it gushed irrepressibly upward,—when it assumed its utmost breadth and power, so overfilling the church as to burst its way through the solid walls, and diffuse itself in the open air,—still, if the auditor listened intently, and for the purpose, he could detect the same cry of pain. What was it? The complaint of a human heart, sorrow-laden, perchance guilty, telling its secret, whether of guilt or sorrow, to the great heart of mankind; beseeching its sympathy or forgiveness,—at every moment,—in each accent,—and never in vain! It was this profound and continual undertone that gave the clergyman his most appropriate power.",

An irresistible feeling kept Hester near the spot. The crowd was too dense for her to manoeuvre a passage into the church; and besides, what spiritual food could she look for there? She waited, therefore, while the sermon proceeded, not far from the scaffold on which had stood the pillory formerly, and still was permanently fixed the whipping-post and stocks. A neighbor she might have had, from one of the many windows of the church, or perhaps almost in the doorway, if she had seen fit to arrange herself closer to the building's walls. But it was not so. At only a little distance from the meeting-house she stood, an insulated figure, looking neither to the right nor left, nor backwards, but gazing straight before her at the platform of the scaffold. Ample as was the space about her, it was less than the breadth of a single room, yet it seemed the verge of the green forest, into which it had formerly been her custom to fly for refuge. That had been her wilderness, her desert; not by any necessity of nature, but by the sternest law of human fate. She had wandered without rule or guidance, in a moral wilderness; as vast, as intricate and shadowy, as the untamed forest, between the closely-inhabited settlements, but infinitely drearier and more dangerous. The pathway of human existence now lay before her, stretching onward, and in nowise diverging from that which the crowd was treading. It was the iron rule that she had now at last taken hold of. It was the great law of mutual support, that should now be the law of her life. She was never more to stand apart, nor to commune aside from a world that was so fast hastening to its doom. It was therefore with a sense of inevitable doom, that she stood near the scaffold, and listened to the sermon of the Reverend Mr. Dimmesdale. His voice, developed in the enriched burr of the crowd, was in itself a rich strain of music, that seemed to have made its way into the church, and now rolled forth from the building, as if it were a part of the organ's peal. It was a voice that had in it the tone of an organ, and the depth of a bell, and the power of a trumpet, and the sweetness of a flute, and the pathos of a human heart. It was a voice that could have swayed an audience, by its tone and rhythm alone, even without the aid of words. The words, indeed, were hardly to be distinguished, by the ear that was not within the church. But the voice, as it rolled forth, was a sort of universal language, that spoke to the heart, and not to the understanding.

                "text": "By this time the preliminary prayer had been offered in the meeting-house, and the accents of the Reverend Mr. Dimmesdale were heard commencing his discourse. An irresistible feeling kept Hester near the spot. The crowd was too dense for her to manoeuvre a passage into the church; and besides, what spiritual food could she look for there? She waited, therefore, while the sermon proceeded, not far from the scaffold on which had stood the pillory formerly, and still was permanently fixed the whipping-post and stocks. A neighbor she might have had, from one of the many windows of the church, or perhaps almost in the doorway, if she had seen fit to arrange herself closer to the building's walls. But it was not so. At only a little distance from the meeting-house she stood, an insulated figure, looking neither to the right nor left, nor backwards, but gazing straight before her at the platform of the scaffold. Ample as was the space about her, it was less than the breadth of a single room, yet it seemed the verge of the green forest, into which it had formerly been her custom to fly for refuge. That had been her wilderness, her desert; not by any necessity of nature, but by the sternest law of human fate. She had wandered without rule or guidance, in a moral wilderness; as vast, as intricate and shadowy, as the untamed forest, between the closely-inhabited settlements, but infinitely drearier and more dangerous. The pathway of human existence now lay before her, stretching onward, and in nowise diverging from that which the crowd was treading. It was the iron rule that she had now at last taken hold of. It was the great law of mutual support, that should now be the law of her life. She was never more to stand apart, nor to commune aside from a world that was so fast hastening to its doom. It was therefore with a sense of inevitable doom, that she stood near the scaffold, and listened to the sermon of the Reverend Mr. Dimmesdale. His voice, developed in the enriched burr of the crowd, was in itself a rich strain of music, that seemed to have made its way into the church, and now rolled forth from the building, as if it were a part of the organ's peal.

If the minister’s voice had not kept her there, there would nevertheless have been an inevitable magnetism in that spot, whence she dated the first hour of her life of ignominy. There was a sense within her,—too ill-defined to be made a thought, but weighing heavily on her mind,—that her whole orb of life, both before and after, was connected with this spot, as with the one point that gave it unity.\nLittle Pearl, meanwhile, had quitted her mother’s side, and was playing at her own will about the market-place. She made the sombre crowd cheerful by her erratic and glistening ray; even as a bird of bright plumage illuminates a whole tree of dusky foliage, by darting to and fro, half seen and half concealed amid the twilight of the clustering leaves. She had an undulating, but, oftentimes, a sharp and irregular movement. It indicated the restless vivacity of her spirit, which to-day was doubly indefatigable in its tiptoe dance, because it was played upon and vibrated with her mother’s disquietude. Whenever Pearl saw anything to excite her ever-active and wandering curiosity, she flew thitherward and, as we might say, seized upon that man or thing as her own property, so far as she desired it; but without yielding the minutest degree of control over her motions in requital. The Puritans looked on, and, if they smiled, were none the less inclined to pronounce the child a demon offspring, from the indescribable charm of beauty and eccentricity that shone through her little figure, and sparkled with its activity. She ran and looked the wild Indian in the face; and he grew conscious of a nature wilder than his own. Thence, with native audacity, but still with a reserve as characteristic, she flew into the midst of a group of mariners, the swarthy-cheeked wild men of the ocean, as the Indians were of the land; and they gazed wonderingly and admiringly at Pearl, as if a flake of the sea-foam had taken the shape of a little maid, and were gifted with a soul of the sea-fire, that flashes beneath the prow in the night-time.\nOne of these seafaring men—the shipmaster, indeed, who had spoken to Hester Prynne—was so smitten with Pearl’s aspect, that he attempted to lay hands upon her, with purpose to snatch a kiss. Finding it as impossible to touch her as to catch a humming-bird in the air, he took from his hat the gold chain that was twisted about it, and threw it to the child. Pearl immediately twined it around her neck and waist, with such happy skill, that, once seen there, it became a part of her, and it was difficult to imagine her without it.\n“Thy mother is yonder woman with the scarlet letter,” said the seaman. “Wilt thou carry her a message from me?”\n“If the message pleases me, I will,” answered Pearl.\n“Then tell her,” rejoined he, “that I spake again with the black-a-visaged, hump-shouldered old doctor, and he engages to bring his friend, the gentleman she wots of, aboard with him. So let thy mother take no thought, save for herself and thee. Wilt thou tell her this, thou witch-baby?”\n“Mistress Hibbins says my father is the Prince of the Air!” cried Pearl, with a naughty smile. “If thou callest me that ill name, I shall tell him of thee; and he will chase thy ship with a tempest!”\nPursuing a zigzag course across the market-place, the child returned to her mother, and communicated what the mariner had said. Hester’s strong, calm, steadfastly enduring spirit almost sank, at last, on beholding this dark and grim countenance of an inevitable doom, which—at the moment when a passage seemed to open for the minister and herself out of their labyrinth of misery—showed itself, with an unrelenting smile, right in the midst of their path.",

With her whole spirit she prayed that, stepping into the open air, Dimmesdale might be enabled to disclose the secret that was so fretting against his heart, and so evidently preying upon his vitals. In this state of mind, she gazed upon the minister with the wildest emotion. She felt that she could die for him, but could not relieve him.

            "prefix-probing": "During all this time, Hester stood, statue-like, at the foot of the scaffold. Her spirit, however, was not so inactive. It was flying back, over many years, and bringing with it the whole tale of her past life, and rendering it visible to her at a glance. She saw her father’s face, with the grave, sad gentleness of its expression, its never-failing love, and so calm a pride, that she knew not whether to weep or smile. She saw her mother’s features, stern, yet with an inexpressible tenderness, and a look so deeply familiar, that she seemed to have dropped the object from her grasp, and forgotten what she had just been doing, when she beheld it. But the object was her infant child. She saw the home of her childhood, a little hamlet, in rural England, with the old gray church tower rising above the trees; and she saw herself, a little girl, with her mother, and grandmother, and great-grandmother, all gathered round the hearth, and yet she was alone in the world. Then came the image of a man, a deformed figure of a man, with a pale, intellectual face, and a pair of keen, dark eyes. It was her husband. She saw him, as he had been, in their youth, before he had been bowed down by study, and by the weight of years. She saw him, as he was now, with his face furrowed by thought, and his eyes gleaming with a strange, cold fire. She saw him, as he had been, when he had wooed her, and won her, and she had given him her hand, and her heart, and her life. She saw him, as he was now, standing in the crowd, with his eyes fixed upon her, and a smile upon his face, a smile that was more terrible than a frown. She saw him, and she knew that he was her husband. She knew that he had come to seek her, and to find her, and to take vengeance upon her. She knew that she was in his power, and that she could not escape him. She knew that she was lost. Yet, in the midst of all this, she was conscious of the eyes of the multitude, that were fastened upon her. She was conscious of the gaze of the magistrates, and the ministers, and the Governor, who were seated upon the platform above her. She was conscious of the scarlet letter upon her breast, that was the cause of all this ignominy. She was conscious of the child in her arms, that was the living symbol of her shame. She was conscious of the scaffold beneath her feet, that was the place of her punishment. She was conscious of the sky above her head, that was the witness of her sin. She was conscious of the earth beneath her, that was the grave of her reputation. She was conscious of all these things, and yet she stood, statue-like, at the foot of the scaffold. The Governor, a man of stern and venerable aspect, with a long white beard, and a face furrowed by care and thought, rose from his seat, and addressed the multitude. He spoke of the heinousness of the crime that had been committed, and of the necessity of punishing it, in order that others might be deterred from following the same path. He spoke of the mercy that had been shown to the criminal, in that her life had been spared, and that she had been allowed to keep her child. He spoke of the hope that she might yet be brought to repentance, and that she might yet be saved. He then turned to Hester, and exhorted her to confess the name of the man who had been her partner in guilt. He told her that it was her duty to God, and to the community, and to herself, to reveal the truth. He told her that if she did so, she might yet find peace, and that she might yet be restored to the favor of God and man. He ceased, and the Reverend Mr. Wilson, a man of advanced age, with a mild and benevolent countenance, and a voice that was tremulous with emotion, took his place. He spoke of the sinfulness of the human heart, and of the power of"

There were many people present, from the country round about, who had often heard of the scarlet letter, and to whom it had been made terrific by a hundred false or exaggerated rumors, but who had never beheld it with their own bodily eyes. These, after exhausting other modes of amusement, now thronged about Hester Prynne with rude and boorish intrusiveness. Unscrupulous as it was, however, it could not bring them nearer than a circuit of several yards. At that distance they accordingly stood, fixed there by the centrifugal force of the repugnance which the mystic symbol inspired. The whole gang of sailors, likewise, observing the press of spectators, and learning the purport of the scarlet letter, came and thrust their sunburnt and desperado-looking faces into the ring. Even the Indians were affected by a sort of cold shadow of the white man’s curiosity, and, gliding through the crowd, fastened their snake-like black eyes on Hester’s bosom; conceiving, perhaps, that the wearer of this brilliantly embroidered badge must needs be a personage of high dignity among her people. Lastly the inhabitants of the town (their own interest in this worn-out subject languidly reviving itself, by sympathy with what they saw others feel) lounged idly to the same quarter, and tormented Hester Prynne, perhaps more than all the rest, with their cool, well-acquainted gaze at her familiar shame. Hester saw and recognized the selfsame faces of that group of matrons, who had awaited her forthcoming from the prison-door, seven years ago; all save one, the youngest and only compassionate among them, whose burial-robe she had since made. At the final hour, when she was so soon to fling aside the burning letter, it had strangely become the centre of more remark and excitement, and was thus made to sear her breast more painfully, than at any time since the first day she put it on.",

There were many people present, from the country towns and villages roundabout, who had not seen Hester Prynne before, and at whose firesides they had often heard her story. They thronged about her, and eyed her with rude, unpitying, and insolent free-will, as if she were a figure of burnished brass, and not a woman suffering for her sins. The latter part of the spell about her was still unbroken. The virgins of eighteen might still have borne upon their bosoms the scarlet letter, which she had caused to be in fashion, at least with the older generation; but they had since adopted the fashion of embroidered yellow birds, and had ceased to admire Hester’s needlework. But Hester Prynne had long ceased to be a fashion. That nightmare of public shame and agony would so soon be over, that she could afford to look back at it, now, without affright. Indeed, having so long walked in gloomy twilight, with the dimmest rays of earthly comfort shining in upon her path, she had learned to enjoy and cherish every glimmering of sunshine, and every moment of a brighter kind of sky. She might at last look forward to a period when she should again be human, and not a symbol. And so she might have looked forward, with a smile, had it been God’s good pleasure that this period should be now. But here, again, was the scarlet letter, burning on her breast! And here, again, was the crowd of spectators, with their eyes bent on her, and their tongues whispering about that symbol, which was the object of her agony, and their idle curiosity! The sailors, of whom there were many in the crowd, not having attended the sermon, nevertheless thronged here to witness the procession, and had more than once singled out Hester Prynne, and commented freely upon her. They were, by profession, long conversant with curious sights, and accustomed to stare them out of countenance. These seafaring men, therefore, were not so easily moved, by the customary awe with which the scarlet letter was beheld. They gazed at it, not with shock, but with a strange kind of amusement; and, at intervals, they burst into loud laughter, which made the little crowd about Hester vibrate with sympathy. One of these jolly tars, a sweet-tempered fellow, who had been sharing a flask of gin with the shipmaster, expressed his opinion that the wearer of the scarlet letter was a pretty woman, and that he would not be afraid to give her a kiss! This was a jest which Hester Prynne, who had heard no such jest for seven years past, found it hard to bear. The crowd, meanwhile, was constantly increasing, by the accession of people from the country, and by the return of such townspeople as had been distributed along the street, and occupied in the duties of the day.

The moment was that of greatest brilliancy in the career of the Reverend Mr. Dimmesdale. Never, surely, since his dimmest youth, had he shown himself so capable of penetrating the human heart, with a special reference to its spiritual needs and capacities, and dangers. Never, on the other hand, had he thrown so powerful a spell over a multitude. People came long distances to witness the procession, and not less to hear the sermon preached on the occasion, by the Reverend Mr. Dimmesdale. In this latter object, they were not disappointed. The sermon was throughout an admirable effort of high religious faith, and rising eloquence. The subject, it is true, it had been impossible to discuss, in its full depth and breadth, without a considerable degree of outward decorum; but this deficiency was more than compensated for by the fervor and earnestness with which it was delivered. The minister's voice, at first weak and tremulous, had now attained a full volume, and sonorousness, and rang throughout the church with a power that seemed to penetrate into the innermost heart of every auditor. The discourse was in the highest strain of eloquence which it had ever been his lot to hear. It was a sermon of such depth and power, that it seemed to have been inspired by the very spirit of God. The effect upon the vast multitude was electrical. It was as if the preacher had laid his hand upon the secret of each soul, and had caused it to thrill and vibrate with the touch. The effect was so powerful, that it seemed as if the very walls of the church were about to fall down, and crush the congregation. The sermon concluded with a passage of such pathetic tenderness, and such solemn warning, that it seemed to have been written with tears, and to have been delivered with a broken heart. The effect upon the audience was such, that many of them were moved to tears, and some of them even sobbed aloud. The sermon was followed by a prayer, which was equally powerful and pathetic. The whole service was concluded with a hymn, which was sung by the whole congregation, and which seemed to express the feelings of every heart. The procession then formed, and marched out of the church. The Governor and the magistrates, the military and the clergy, the people and the children, all joined in the procession. The procession marched through the streets of the town, and was everywhere greeted with the acclamations of the people. The procession was a grand and imposing spectacle. It was a spectacle that was calculated to impress the minds of the people with a sense of the power and dignity of the government.

There was a momentary silence, profound as what should follow the utterance of oracles. Then ensued a murmur and half-hushed tumult; as if the auditors, released from the high spell that had transported them into the region of another’s mind, were returning into themselves, with all their awe and wonder still heavy on them. In a moment more, the crowd began to gush forth from the doors of the church. Now that there was an end, they needed other breath, more fit to support the gross and earthly life into which they relapsed, than that atmosphere which the preacher had converted into words of flame, and had burdened with the rich fragrance of his thought.\nIn the open air their rapture broke into speech. The street and the market-place absolutely babbled, from side to side, with applauses of the minister. His hearers could not rest until they had told one another of what each knew better than he could tell or hear. According to their united testimony, never had man spoken in so wise, so high, and so holy a spirit, as he that spake this day; nor had inspiration ever breathed through mortal lips more evidently than it did through his. Its influence could be seen, as it were, descending upon him, and possessing him, and continually lifting him out of the written discourse that lay before him, and filling him with ideas that must have been as marvellous to himself as to his audience. His subject, it appeared, had been the relation between the Deity and the communities of mankind, with a special reference to the New England which they were here planting in the wilderness. And, as he drew towards the close, a spirit as of prophecy had come upon him, constraining him to its purpose as mightily as the old prophets of Israel were constrained; only with this difference, that, whereas the Jewish seers had denounced judgments and ruin on their country, it was his mission to foretell a high and glorious destiny for the newly gathered people of the Lord. But, throughout it all, and through the whole discourse, there had been a certain deep, sad undertone of pathos, which could not be interpreted otherwise than as the natural regret of one soon to pass away. Yes; their minister whom they so loved—and who so loved them all, that he could not depart heavenward without a sigh—had the foreboding of untimely death upon him, and would soon leave them in their tears! This idea of his transitory stay on earth gave the last emphasis to the effect which the preacher had produced; it was as if an angel, in his passage to the skies, had shaken his bright wings over the people for an instant,—at once a shadow and a splendor,—and had shed down a shower of golden truths upon them.\nThus, there had come to the Reverend Mr. Dimmesdale—as to most men, in their various spheres, though seldom recognized until they see it far behind them—an epoch of life more brilliant and full of triumph than any previous one, or than any which could hereafter be. He stood, at this moment, on the very proudest eminence of superiority, to which the gifts of intellect, rich lore, prevailing eloquence, and a reputation of whitest sanctity, could exalt a clergyman in New England’s earliest days, when the professional character was of itself a lofty pedestal. Such was the position which the minister occupied, as he bowed his head forward on the cushions of the pulpit, at the close of his Election Sermon. Meanwhile Hester Prynne was standing beside the scaffold of the pillory, with the scarlet letter still burning on her breast!",

Then, there was silence, as if the auditors feared to breathe. An unutterable awe, like the thrill of the universal earthquake, pervaded the astonished multitude. As they recovered from it, the people began to disperse, making their way homeward by various paths, but all with a united impulse to talk of the minister, and to uplift their hands to heaven in wonder and thanksgiving, for the godly gifts that had come down among them. In their prayers and thanksgivings, they recounted not only the wonders of the sermon, but the divine power that had wrought them.

Those who had long known the minister, were not less astonished than the newcomers, by the unfathomable depth of his wisdom, the height of his holiness, and the earnestness with which he strove to communicate his zealousкую faith. To a sensitive observer, there was a sadness, fearfully deep, all pervading, and optimise, in the tone of the discourse, which not only conveyed the impression of an unutterable sorrow, but was felt to be the very occasion and cause of it. This sadness lent a meaning never before thought of, to the discourse, and made it a prophetic utterance, which, coming from the lips of a dying man, might well be deemed the last word of the voice of God. The minister's sermon had been addressed to the whole body of the magistracy, clergy, and people, and had produced an effect which, as regarded its immediate influence, could not be surpassed.

Those who had long known the minister, were not less astonished than the newcomers, by the unfathomable depth of his wisdom, the height of his holiness, and the earnestness with which he strove to communicate his zealousкую faith. To a sensitive observer, there was a sadness, fearfully deep, all pervading, and optimise, in the tone of the discourse, which not only conveyed the impression of an unutterable sorrow, but was felt to be the very occasion and cause of it. This sadness lent a meaning never before thought of, to the discourse, and made it a prophetic utterance, which, coming from the lips of a dying man, might well be deemed the last word of the voice of God. The minister's sermon had been addressed to the whole body of the magistracy, clergy, and people, and had produced an effect which, as regarded its immediate influence, could not be surpassed. It was the utterance of a great and solemn truth, which it behooved the people to lay to heart, and which, if they did, might be the salvation of their souls.

The procession was to be marshalled thence to the town-hall, where a solemn banquet would complete the ceremonies of the day.\nOnce more, therefore, the train of venerable and majestic fathers was seen moving through a broad pathway of the people, who drew back reverently, on either side, as the Governor and magistrates, the old and wise men, the holy ministers, and all that were eminent and renowned, advanced into the midst of them. When they were fairly in the market-place, their presence was greeted by a shout. This—though doubtless it might acquire additional force and volume from the childlike loyalty which the age awarded to its rulers—was felt to be an irrepressible outburst of enthusiasm kindled in the auditors by that high strain of eloquence which was yet reverberating in their ears. Each felt the impulse in himself, and, in the same breath, caught it from his neighbor. Within the church, it had hardly been kept down; beneath the sky, it pealed upward to the zenith. There were human beings enough, and enough of highly wrought and symphonious feeling, to produce that more impressive sound than the organ tones of the blast, or the thunder, or the roar of the sea; even that mighty swell of many voices, blended into one great voice by the universal impulse which makes likewise one vast heart out of the many. Never, from the soil of New England, had gone up such a shout! Never, on New England soil, had stood the man so honored by his mortal brethren as the preacher!\nHow fared it with him then? Were there not the brilliant particles of a halo in the air about his head? So etherealized by spirit as he was, and so apotheosized by worshipping admirers, did his footsteps, in the procession, really tread upon the dust of earth?\nAs the ranks of military men and civil fathers moved onward, all eyes were turned towards the point where the minister was seen to approach among them. The shout died into a murmur, as one portion of the crowd after another obtained a glimpse of him. How feeble and pale he looked, amid all his triumph! The energy—or say, rather, the inspiration which had held him up, until he should have delivered the sacred message that brought its own strength along with it from heaven—was withdrawn, now that it had so faithfully performed its office. The glow, which they had just before beheld burning on his cheek, was extinguished, like a flame that sinks down hopelessly among the late-decaying embers. It seemed hardly the face of a man alive, with such a death-like hue; it was hardly a man with life in him, that tottered on his path so nervelessly, yet tottered, and did not fall!\nOne of his clerical brethren,—it was the venerable John Wilson,—observing the state in which Mr. Dimmesdale was left by the retiring wave of intellect and sensibility, stepped forward hastily to offer his support. The minister tremulously, but decidedly, repelled the old man’s arm. He still walked onward, if that movement could be so described, which rather resembled the wavering effort of an infant, with its mother’s arms in view, outstretched to tempt him forward. And now, almost imperceptible as were the latter steps of his progress, he had come opposite the well-remembered and weather-darkened scaffold, where, long since, with all that dreary lapse of time between, Hester Prynne had encountered the world’s ignominious stare. There stood Hester, holding little Pearl by the hand! And there was the scarlet letter on her breast! The minister here made a pause; although the music still played the stately and rejoicing march to which the procession moved. It summoned him onward,—onward to the festival!—but here he made a pause.",

He now left his own place in the procession, and advanced to give assistance; judging, from Mr. Dimmesdale’s aspect, that he must otherwise inevitably fall. But there was something in the latter’s expression that warned back the magistrate, although a man not readily obeying the vague intimations that pass from one spirit to another. The crowd, meanwhile, looked on with awe and wonder. This earthly faintness was, in their view, only another phase of the minister’s celestial strength; nor would it have seemed a miracle too high to be wrought for one so holy, had he ascended before their eyes, waxing dimmer and brighter, and fading at last into the light of heaven.\nHe turned towards the scaffold, and stretched forth his arms.\n“Hester,” said he, “come hither! Come, my little Pearl!”\nIt was a ghastly look with which he regarded them; but there was something at once tender and strangely triumphant in it. The child, with the bird-like motion which was one of her characteristics, flew to him, and clasped her arms about his knees. Hester Prynne—slowly, as if impelled by inevitable fate, and against her strongest will—likewise drew near, but paused before she reached him. At this instant, old Roger Chillingworth thrust himself through the crowd,—or, perhaps, so dark, disturbed, and evil, was his look, he rose up out of some nether region,—to snatch back his victim from what he sought to do! Be that as it might, the old man rushed forward, and caught the minister by the arm.\n“Madman, hold! what is your purpose?” whispered he. “Wave back that woman! Cast off this child! All shall be well! Do not blacken your fame, and perish in dishonor! I can yet save you! Would you bring infamy on your sacred profession?”\n“Ha, tempter! Methinks thou art too late!” answered the minister, encountering his eye, fearfully, but firmly. “Thy power is not what it was! With God’s help, I shall escape thee now!”\nHe again extended his hand to the woman of the scarlet letter.\n“Hester Prynne,” cried he, with a piercing earnestness, “in the name of Him, so terrible and so merciful, who gives me grace, at this last moment, to do what—for my own heavy sin and miserable agony—I withheld myself from doing seven years ago, come hither now, and twine thy strength about me! Thy strength, Hester; but let it be guided by the will which God hath granted me! This wretched and wronged old man is opposing it with all his might!—with all his own might, and the fiend’s! Come, Hester, come! Support me up yonder scaffold!”",

He now stepped forth, and, accosting the minister, half spoke, half whispered, —\n\n“A good man’s prayers are mighty, sir,” said he. “Pray, what is it? have you found some gracious message of Heaven, that you struggle thus? — stand firmly on your feet! pull yourself down into a man!”\n\nIt was not Governor Bellingham, however. In this awful crisis of the disease, as it were, when it strove to achieve its utmost agony, his spirit made itself the master of the frail organism that enclosed it. He refused to be governed by it any longer, he took its own agony into his soul, and ordered it to wait his pleasure, and not to burst forth without his bidding. He held his hand over his heart, and seemed to support it there, while his countenance expressed the utmost force of will. There was no disease in his look, but a whole world of pain, — so terrible to be borne, that it shivered his bodily frame. These features of character, he had heretofore hidden so deeply in the immeasurable depths of our nature, that he himself could hardly tell whether they belonged to him or not. They now came forth to the daylight, and assumed real substance and form. When Governor Bellingham saw this, he involuntarily drew back. Awe, but not fear, was in his look. The awe was mingled with the astonishment at the minister’s power, and with the half-incredulity that he should thus miracle on the verge of death. “Heaven be praised!” thought he. “There is strength in him, that exceeds our own!”\n\nAnd the people, having beheld all this, did but admire the more the minister’s celestial strength, that only grew the stronger, when earth was failing him. They knew not the agony with which he strove against bodily weakness, and pain, and death, and drew from Heaven that help which, at that moment, was diffused throughout his frame, and set him on his feet, heaven-aided, and heaven-directed, to do what he had to do. The crowd was hushed, and only the minister’s voice was heard. He turned towards the scaffold, and stretched forth his arms. —\n\n“Hester,” cried he, with a voice of agony, that was heard over the whole multitude, “come hither! come, my little Pearl!”\n\nIt was a ghastly look with which he regarded them; and a ghastly cry that he uttered. But there was a sweet, sad smile on Pearl’s face, when she flew to him, and clasped her arms about his knees. Hester Prynne, slowly, as if impelled by an inevitable necessity, against her own will, and without volution, came forward, and stood at the foot of the scaffold. —\n\n“I am here, my father, — I am here!” cried little Pearl, in her sweet, clear voice. “And my mother is here too!”\n\n“Brave little Pearl!” answered the minister, with a smile. “Thou must gather up thy courage, and come up with me.”\n\nThere was no time to be lost.

But he hid it cunningly from men, and walked among you with the mien of a spirit, mournful, because so pure in a sinful world!—and sad, because he missed his heavenly kindred!

Throughout all the weary and painful seven years, since that scarlet 'A' was first put upon her breast, she hath borne it all alone! But the torture of her daily shame hath been the torture of my daily shame. And now, at this eleventh hour, I stand before you, the vilest of all sinners, a pollution, a lie! And, my God, with whom I have wrestled, and prayed, and yearned for the truth, and lo! the truth is here! Deny it, if ye may! I say that old Roger Chillingworth, the physician,—there he stands!—he was my physician! Trusting no man as his friend, he could not recognize his enemy when the latter stood before him. But the daylight of this awful hour has flooded his innermost heart, and shown him to himself. Behold a terrible witness of the judgment they so prate about! The judgment of God is on me! It is on me! And I am here, that ye may see the mark!\"",

            "prefix-probing": "Partly supported by Hester Prynne, and holding one hand of little Pearl’s, the Reverend Mr. Dimmesdale turned to the dignified and venerable rulers; to the holy ministers, who were his brethren; to the people, whose great heart was thoroughly appalled, yet overflowing with tearful sympathy, as knowing that some deep life-matter—which, if full of sin, was full of anguish and repentance likewise—was now to be laid open to them.  “Ye beheld me,” cried the minister. “Ye beheld me, in the extremity of the great agony, just now. Ay, before that, too! I have shown you, for years past, the scarlet letter on my breast!”\n\nAnd, to the amazement of all the multitude, which beheld only a figure of sin and agony, he tore away the ministerial band from before his breast. It was revealed! But not by Hester’s needle was this scarlet letter wrought. It was the brand of pain, and guilt, and death;—which Hester’s badge had been, and still was, but now converted into a strange horror. It was, in short, the handiwork of a fiend, not of a woman;—stamped upon the flesh of a man, whom God had left, with a terrible mockery, to wear his punishment where it could be seen, and not in secret. The crowd stood breathless, gazing at the ghastly spectacle. Some affirmed that the letter was branded into his flesh; others, that it was a supernatural manifestation of the anguish that gnawed at his heart; others, again, that it was the effect of Chillingworth’s infernal arts. But there it was, a terrible reality, whether of human or demoniac origin, or both. The minister, with a convulsive motion, faltered, and would have fallen, but for the timely aid of Hester. He leaned upon her breast, and supported by her arm, and with Pearl’s hand in his, he spoke again.\n\n“God’s eye beheld it!” cried he. “The angels were forever pointing at it! The Devil knew it well, and fretted at the agony of not being able to snatch his victim at once! But here stands one who, by a strange Providence, is the living symbol of my sin and of my punishment!” He pointed to Hester. “And here,” he continued, “is the child! the offspring of my iniquity! Come forth, thou child of shame and sorrow! Do not shrink from thy father’s dying embrace!”\n\nPearl, with a sob, threw her arms about his neck. A spell was broken. The great scene of grief, in which the wild infant bore a part, had developed all her sympathies; and as her tears fell upon her father’s cheek, they were the pledge that she would grow up amid human joy and sorrow, nor forever do battle with the world, but be a woman in it. The kiss that Pearl gave the dying minister was the first that she had ever impressed upon his lips. And now, at last, the agony of the minister’s soul, and long-hidden sin, burst forth in a great cry, which seemed to rend the very sky. Chillingworth, with a look of utter defeat, cried out, “Thou hast escaped me!” Dimmesdale, sinking, spoke his last words, blessing God for the scaffold, for Hester, for Pearl, and for the public ignominy that had saved his soul. He fell upon the scaffold, and died."

Then tell me what thou seest?”\n“Hush, Hester, hush!” said he, with tremulous solemnity. “The law we broke!—the sin here so awfully revealed!—let these alone be in thy thoughts! I fear! I fear! It may be, that, when we forgot our God,—when we violated our reverence each for the other’s soul,—it was thenceforth vain to hope that we could meet hereafter, in an everlasting and pure reunion. God knows; and He is merciful! He hath proved his mercy, most of all, in my afflictions. By giving me this burning torture to bear upon my breast!

          "text_segment": "AFTER many days, when time sufficed for the people to arrange their thoughts in reference to the foregoing scene, there was more than one account of what had been witnessed on the scaffold.\nMost of the spectators testified to having seen, on the breast of the unhappy minister, a SCARLET LETTER—the very semblance of that worn by Hester Prynne—imprinted in the flesh. As regarded its origin, there were various explanations, all of which must necessarily have been conjectural. Some affirmed that the Reverend Mr. Dimmesdale, on the very day when Hester Prynne first wore her ignominious badge, had begun a course of penance,—which he afterwards, in so many futile methods, followed out,—by inflicting a hideous torture on himself. Others contended that the stigma had not been produced until a long time subsequent, when old Roger Chillingworth, being a potent necromancer, had caused it to appear, through the agency of magic and poisonous drugs. Others, again,—and those best able to appreciate the minister’s peculiar sensibility, and the wonderful operation of his spirit upon the body,—whispered their belief, that the awful symbol was the effect of the ever-active tooth of remorse, gnawing from the inmost heart outwardly, and at last manifesting Heaven’s dreadful judgment by the visible presence of the letter. The reader may choose among these theories. We have thrown all the light we could acquire upon the portent, and would gladly, now that it has done its office, erase its deep print out of our own brain; where long meditation has fixed it in very undesirable distinctness.\nIt is singular, nevertheless, that certain persons, who were spectators of the whole scene, and professed never once to have removed their eyes from the Reverend Mr. Dimmesdale, denied that there was any mark whatever on his breast, more than on a new-born infant’s. Neither, by their report, had his dying words acknowledged, nor even remotely implied, any, the slightest connection, on his part, with the guilt for which Hester Prynne had so long worn the scarlet letter. According to these highly respectable witnesses, the minister, conscious that he was dying,—conscious, also, that the reverence of the multitude placed him already among saints and angels,—had desired, by yielding up his breath in the arms of that fallen woman, to express to the world how utterly nugatory is the choicest of man’s own righteousness. After exhausting life in his efforts for mankind’s spiritual good, he had made the manner of his death a parable, in order to impress on his admirers the mighty and mournful lesson, that, in the view of Infinite Purity, we are sinners all alike. It was to teach them, that the holiest among us has but attained so far above his fellows as to discern more clearly the Mercy which looks down, and repudiate more utterly the phantom of human merit, which would look aspiringly upward. Without disputing a truth so momentous, we must be allowed to consider this version of Mr. Dimmesdale’s story as only an instance of that stubborn fidelity with which a man’s friends—and especially a clergyman’s—will sometimes uphold his character, when proofs, clear as the mid-day sunshine on the scarlet letter, establish him a false and sin-stained creature of the dust.",

Most of the spectators testified to having seen, on the breast of the unhappy minister, a scarlet letter—the very semblance of that worn by Hester Prynne—imprinted in the flesh. As regarded its origin, there were various explanations, all of which must necessarily have been conjectural. One held that the Reverend Mr. Dimmesdale, from the day when Hester first wore the scarlet letter, had begun a course of penance—which he afterwards, in so many words, confessed to his friend, Mr. Wilson—by inflicting a hideous torture on himself. Another theory was, that the strain of remorse and agony, continually pressing on his heart, had caused all the fibres of the poor minister's flesh to convege towards that single point, as to the centre of the bodily pain, and had there produced new substance, like the growth of a mossy tree against a rock-face, that came to be the symbol of the agony that so gnawed into him. Some affirmed that Roger Chillingworth had by his art wrought the mischief, and made himself the instrument of divine retribution. The crowd, not one of whom knew the secret that pervaded them all, were in this matter bewildered and lost. There was a general cry and utterance of lamentation; but not a word of rebuke against the guilty pair, who stood on the scaffold, and were not more guilty than many other people in the crowd. The narrator presents these differing explanations, leaving the reader to decide which is most plausible. Conversely, certain individuals who claimed to have observed the entire event intently denied that any mark whatsoever was present on Dimmesdale's breast. According to their testimony, Dimmesdale's dying words did not acknowledge or even subtly suggest any personal involvement in the sin for which Hester Prynne was punished. These witnesses believed that the minister, aware of his impending death and his revered status, intended his demise in the arms of Hester to be a symbolic lesson about the inadequacy of human righteousness before God. They interpreted his final act as a parable meant to convey that all individuals are inherently sinful and that true holiness is found in recognizing divine mercy, rather than in human achievements.

It was affirmed by most, and believed by many, that, kneeling on the scaffold, with Hester Prynne and little Pearl beside him, the Reverend Mr. Dimmesdale had confessed his sin, and revealed the scarlet letter on his breast.  They said that the Reverend Mr. Dimmesdale, on the very spot where, in his youth, he had spoken words of condemnation against Hester Prynne, had, by Divine Providence, been brought to acknowledge his own guilt.  They averred that the mark on his breast, so long a mystery, was the physical manifestation of his agony of spirit, a brand inflicted either by his own relentless self-torture, or by the direct agency of the Power that brought sin into the world, to make manifest the hidden corruption of the soul.  This version of the story, which included the minister's dying words of penitence and his final embrace of Hester and Pearl, was the one most consonant with the religious temper of the age and the community.  It spoke of a soul redeemed through confession and suffering, a sinner brought to light at the very moment of death, thus offering a powerful moral lesson to all who beheld it.  It was the tale that the children would hear from their parents, and the one that would be preached from the pulpits, a testament to the terrible consequences of secret sin and the ultimate triumph of truth.  However, there were others, a respectable minority, who denied that the Reverend Mr. Dimmesdale had made any confession of crime.  They were men and women who had revered him as a saint on earth, and they could not bear to think that his pure and holy life had been a lie.  These persons affirmed that the minister's dying words, if they had any distinct meaning at all, referred merely to the general sinfulness of the human heart, a doctrine which he had often preached.  As for the mark upon his breast, they said that it was a delusion of the multitude, or a physical symptom caused by his long and terrible penance, or perhaps even the result of Roger Chillingworth's dark arts, which had preyed upon his health and spirit.  They argued that it was impossible for a man so saintly, so pure, so beloved, to have been the partner of Hester Prynne's guilt.  They clung to the image of the spotless minister, preferring to believe that the scaffold scene was a final, dramatic sermon on the vanity of human life and the approach of eternity, rather than a confession of personal sin.

This unhappy man had made the very principle of his life to consist in the pursuit and systematic exercise of revenge; and when, by its completest triumph and consummation, that evil principle was left with no further material to support it, when, in short, there was no more Devil’s work on earth for him to do, it only remained for the unhumanized mortal to betake himself whither his Master would find him tasks enough, and pay him his wages duly. But, to all these shadowy beings, so long our near acquaintances,—as well Roger Chillingworth as his companions,—we would fain be merciful. It is a curious subject of observation and inquiry, whether hatred and love be not the same thing at bottom. Each, in its utmost development, supposes a high degree of intimacy and heart-knowledge; each renders one individual dependent for the food of his affections and spiritual life upon another; each leaves the passionate lover, or the no less passionate hater, forlorn and desolate by the withdrawal of his subject. Philosophically considered, therefore, the two passions seem essentially the same, except that one happens to be seen in a celestial radiance, and the other in a dusky and lurid glow.

It was not so much with a view to inform the public of the close of that darksome story, as to put them in possession of a fact, which, for reasons of private interest, it would have been preferable to keep concealed, that we afterwards learned the details of Roger Chillingworth's death, and the disposition of his property. It happened, whether from the effect of his entirely hopeless aspect of life, or of some subtle poison of his own contriving, or perhaps because his spirit was kept alive only by the powerful motive of revenge, that Roger Chillingworth, after Dimmesdale's death, had no longer any reason to live, and speedily followed his victim to the grave.\n\nThere was no one, save the Governor and the Reverend Mr. Wilson, who had any claim to be styled his executor. By the will and testament of the deceased, Roger Chillingworth bequeathed a very considerable amount of property, both here in New England, and in the Old Country, to little Pearl, the daughter of Hester Prynne.\n\nSo Pearl became the richest heiress of her day, in the New World. Not only did this inheritance suffice to supply her with all the comforts and luxuries of life, but it must likewise have borne a very considerable influence upon the public estimation of the child. It was proved, by the will, that she was acknowledged as Roger Chillingworth's heir; and, in the very next generation of the settlers, it might have been her happy lot to have mingled the wild blood of the forest-child with that of the purest Puritan lineage.\n\nBut, in no long time after the physician's death, the wearer of the scarlet letter disappeared, and Pearl along with her. It was long thought that she had vanished from the face of the earth, and that, with Pearl, she had ascended to the sky, or sunk into the sea. But, over the course of many years, there came, at intervals, such indistinct rumors from the other side of the sea, as if a message had been wafted across the ocean, and had been caught on the shore, like a piece of driftwood bearing initials, that there was reason to believe that Hester Prynne, with her daughter, had been living, for a considerable time, in some part of Europe. Yet, no authentic intelligence was ever received.\"\n```",

MISSING ELEMENTS:\n- The completion lacks the explanation of the inheritance, including who left it, who managed it, and to whom it was given.\n- There is no mention of the change in social status for Pearl or the potential impact on her future prospects.\n- The metaphor comparing rumors to driftwood is only partially referenced and not fully developed.\n- The passage omits the detail about the lack of authentic news over the years following their disappearance.\n\n3. INACCURATE ELEMENTS:\n- The completion introduces the idea that it was widely believed Hester and Pearl had vanished from the earth, which is not presented in the original in this way.\n- The sequence of events is altered: the disappearance is mentioned before the inheritance and its effects, disrupting the original order.\n- The completion does not accurately represent the timeline regarding the physician's death and subsequent events.\n- The metaphor about driftwood is referenced but not in the same context or with the same nuance as in the original."

This business concerns the welfare of little Pearl, that wild, elfish child, whose existence was both a torment and a solace to her mother, Hester Prynne. The magistrates, those stern pillars of the Puritan community, had long debated the propriety of leaving Pearl in Hester's custody. They questioned whether a child nurtured by a woman marked by sin could ever be brought up in the true path of righteousness. Was not the scarlet letter itself a symbol of the moral wilderness in which Pearl was being raised? The Reverend Mr. Wilson, with his venerable beard and patriarchal air, and Governor Bellingham, with his stiff ruff and even stiffer principles, had summoned Hester to the Governor's mansion to settle this weighty question. It was a moment fraught with peril for Hester, for to lose Pearl would be to lose the only sunshine that pierced the gloom of her existence, the only living link to her past, however painful that past might be. The child, with her strange, intuitive nature, seemed to understand the gravity of the situation, clinging to her mother's skirt with an unusual quietude, her bright eyes fixed upon the faces of the men who held her destiny in their hands. This meeting, therefore, was not merely a formality, but a crucible in which the future of both mother and child would be forged."

As years passed, and Hester Prynne bore her ignominy with quiet strength and tireless charity, the harsh judgment of the Puritan town began subtly to soften. The bright, fiery symbol, meant to brand her forever as an adulteress, seemed to lose its original sting. Through her selfless acts of mercy, her skilled needlework providing comfort to the poor and sick, and her dignified silence in the face of scorn, Hester slowly, painstakingly, redeemed the letter in the eyes of many. It was whispered among the people that the 'A' no longer stood for Adultery, but for 'Able' – a testament to her resilience, her capacity for good works, and her quiet wisdom. The scarlet letter, once a mark of shame, became a symbol of her unique, albeit painful, identity, a legend woven into the very fabric of the town's history, forever linked to the woman who transformed its meaning through suffering and grace."

          "text_segment": "And Hester Prynne had returned, and taken up her long-forsaken shame! But where was little Pearl? If still alive, she must now have been in the flush and bloom of early womanhood. None knew—nor ever learned, with the fulness of perfect certainty—whether the elf-child had gone thus untimely to a maiden grave; or whether her wild, rich nature had been softened and subdued, and made capable of a woman’s gentle happiness. But, through the remainder of Hester’s life, there were indications that the recluse of the scarlet letter was the object of love and interest with some inhabitant of another land. Letters came, with armorial seals upon them, though of bearings unknown to English heraldry. In the cottage there were articles of comfort and luxury such as Hester never cared to use, but which only wealth could have purchased, and affection have imagined for her. There were trifles, too, little ornaments, beautiful tokens of a continual remembrance, that must have been wrought by delicate fingers, at the impulse of a fond heart. And, once, Hester was seen embroidering a baby-garment, with such a lavish richness of golden fancy as would have raised a public tumult, had any infant, thus apparelled, been shown to our sober-hued community.\nIn fine, the gossips of that day believed,—and Mr. Surveyor Pue, who made investigations a century later, believed,—and one of his recent successors in office, moreover, faithfully believes,—that Pearl was not only alive, but married, and happy, and mindful of her mother, and that she would most joyfully have entertained that sad and lonely mother at her fireside.\nBut there was a more real life for Hester Prynne here, in New England, than in that unknown region where Pearl had found a home. Here had been her sin; here, her sorrow; and here was yet to be her penitence. She had returned, therefore, and resumed,—of her own free will, for not the sternest magistrate of that iron period would have imposed it,—resumed the symbol of which we have related so dark a tale. Never afterwards did it quit her bosom. But, in the lapse of the toilsome, thoughtful, and self-devoted years that made up Hester’s life, the scarlet letter ceased to be a stigma which attracted the world’s scorn and bitterness, and became a type of something to be sorrowed over, and looked upon with awe, yet with reverence too. And, as Hester Prynne had no selfish ends, nor lived in any measure for her own profit and enjoyment, people brought all their sorrows and perplexities, and besought her counsel, as one who had herself gone through a mighty trouble. Women, more especially,—in the continually recurring trials of wounded, wasted, wronged, misplaced, or erring and sinful passion,—or with the dreary burden of a heart unyielded, because unvalued and unsought,—came to Hester’s cottage, demanding why they were so wretched, and what the remedy! Hester comforted and counselled them as best she might. She assured them, too, of her firm belief, that, at some brighter period, when the world should have grown ripe for it, in Heaven’s own time, a new truth would be revealed, in order to establish the whole relation between man and woman on a surer ground of mutual happiness. Earlier in life, Hester had vainly imagined that she herself might be the destined prophetess, but had long since recognized the impossibility that any mission of divine and mysterious truth should be confided to a woman stained with sin, bowed down with shame, or even burdened with a life-long sorrow. The angel and apostle of the coming revelation must be a woman, indeed, but lofty, pure, and beautiful; and wise, moreover, not through dusky grief, but the ethereal medium of joy; and showing how sacred love should make us happy, by the truest test of a life successful to such an end!\nSo said Hester Prynne, and glanced her sad eyes downward at the scarlet letter. And, after many, many years, a new grave was delved, near an old and sunken one, in that burial-ground beside which King’s Chapel has since been built. It was near that old and sunken grave, yet with a space between, as if the dust of the two sleepers had no right to mingle. Yet one tombstone served for both. All around, there were monuments carved with armorial bearings; and on this simple slab of slate—as the curious investigator may still discern, and perplex himself with the purport—there appeared the semblance of an engraved escutcheon. It bore a device, a herald’s wording of which might serve for a motto and brief description of our now concluded legend; so sombre is it, and relieved only by one ever-glowing point of light gloomier than the shadow:—“On a field, sable, the letter A, gules.”",
