All she unearthed was the cat. “I’ve truly never encountered such a mischievous boy!” She went to the open doorway and stood there, scanning the garden with its tomato plants and weeds. Tom was nowhere in sight. So she angled her voice for maximum reach and yelled, “Y-o-u-u TOM!” A faint sound from behind her caused her to turn just in time to grab a young boy by the back of his jacket, halting his attempt to flee. “Aha! I should have thought of that closet. What have you been up to in there?” “Nothing,” he replied. “Nothing! Look at your hands. And your mouth. What is that stuff?” “I don’t know, Aunt,” he claimed. “Well, I know. It’s jam—that’s precisely what it is.

The only thing she found was the cat. \"I've never seen a boy to match him!\" she exclaimed. Stepping out to the door, she looked over the tomato plants and weeds that made up the garden.

Like many other simple-hearted souls, it was her pet vanity to believe she was endowed with a talent for dark and mysterious diplomacy, and she loved to contemplate her most transparent devices as marvels of low cunning. Said she:\n“Tom, it was middling warm in school, warn’t it?”\n“Yes’m.”\n“Powerful warm, warn’t it?”\n“Yes’m.”\n“Didn’t you want to go in a-swimming, Tom?”\nA bit of a scare shot through Tom—a touch of uncomfortable suspicion. He searched Aunt Polly’s face, but it told him nothing. So he said:\n“No’m—well, not very much.”\nThe old lady reached out her hand and felt Tom’s shirt, and said:\n“But you ain’t too warm now, though.” And it flattered her to reflect that she had discovered that the shirt was dry without anybody knowing that that was what she had in her mind. But in spite of her, Tom knew where the wind lay, now. So he forestalled what might be the next move:\n“Some of us pumped on our heads—mine’s damp yet. See?”\nAunt Polly was vexed to think she had overlooked that bit of circumstantial evidence, and missed a trick. Then she had a new inspiration:\n“Tom, you didn’t have to undo your shirt collar where I sewed it, to pump on your head, did you? Unbutton your jacket!”\nThe trouble vanished out of Tom’s face. He opened his jacket. His shirt collar was securely sewed.\n“Bother! Well, go ’long with you. I’d made sure you’d played hookey and been a-swimming. But I forgive ye, Tom. I reckon you’re a kind of a singed cat, as the saying is—better’n you look. This time.”\nShe was half sorry her sagacity had miscarried, and half glad that Tom had stumbled into obedient conduct for once.\nBut Sidney said:\n“Well, now, if I didn’t think you sewed his collar with white thread, but it’s black.”\n“Why, I did sew it with white! Tom!”\nBut Tom did not wait for the rest. As he went out at the door he said:\n“Siddy, I’ll lick you for that.”",

Like many simple people, she was proud of her supposed talent for subtle schemes, often seeing her most obvious plans as clever maneuvers. She started, \"Tom, it was quite warm at school, wasn't it?\" \"Yes, ma'am.\" \"Very warm, right?\" \"Yes, ma'am.\" \"Didn't that make you want to go swimming?\" A sudden fear shot through Tom, a hint of suspicion. He looked at Aunt Polly's face, but it didn't give anything away. So he answered, \"No, ma'am... well, not much.\" His aunt reached out and felt his shirt, saying, \"But you're not too hot now, though.\" She was pleased with herself for checking if his shirt was dry without anyone knowing her real purpose. However, Tom now understood what she was getting at. Anticipating her next question, he quickly said, \"Some of us poured water on our heads—mine's still wet. See?\" Aunt Polly was annoyed that she hadn't considered that possibility and had missed catching him out. Then she had a new idea: \"Tom, you wouldn't have had to take out the stitches on your shirt collar where I sewed it to put water on your head, would you? Unbutton your jacket!\" Tom's look of worry vanished. He opened his jacket, showing the collar was still securely sewn. \"Drat! Alright, off you go then. I was sure you'd skipped school and gone swimming. But I forgive you, Tom. As the saying goes, I guess you're a bit of a 'singed cat'—better than you look. This time.\" She was partly disappointed that her cleverness had failed and partly relieved that Tom, for once, seemed to have followed the rules. But Sidney spoke up, \"Well, I thought you sewed his collar with white thread, but it's black.\" \"What? I used white thread! Tom!\" Tom didn't stay to hear the rest. As he left through the door, he shouted back, \"Sidney, I'm going to beat you up for that!\"",
          "paraphrase_gpt-4.1-2025-04-14": "As Tom ate his dinner and secretly took bits of sugar when he could, Aunt Polly questioned him with sly intent, trying to get him to slip up and reveal something incriminating. Like many well-meaning but simple people, she prided herself on her supposed talent for subtle trickery, considering her plainly obvious schemes to be proofs of her cleverness. She began: “Tom, it was pretty warm at school, wasn’t it?” “Yes, ma’am,” Tom replied. “Very warm, wasn’t it?” “Yes, ma’am.” “Didn’t you feel like going for a swim, Tom?” Tom felt a jolt of worry and suspicion at her question. He examined Aunt Polly’s expression, but learned nothing, so he replied, “No, ma’am—well, not really.” Aunt Polly reached over and touched Tom’s shirt, saying, “But you’re not too warm now.” She privately congratulated herself for checking that his shirt was dry without making her intention obvious. But Tom now realized what she was up to, so he took the initiative: “Some of us used the pump on our heads—my hair’s still wet. See?” Aunt Polly was frustrated that she had missed this detail and therefore missed her chance to catch him, but quickly tried a new angle: “Tom, you wouldn’t have needed to undo the shirt collar where I sewed it just to pump your head, would you? Take off your jacket!” Tom, relieved, opened his jacket to reveal the collar still safely sewn. “Hmph! Off you go. I was sure you’d skipped school and gone swimming, but I forgive you this time. I guess you’re better than you seem, Tom, at least for now.” Aunt Polly was a little disappointed that her cleverness hadn’t paid off, but also glad Tom had managed to behave for once. Then Sidney chimed in: “But I thought you sewed his collar with white thread, and this is black.” “But I did use white thread! Tom!” But Tom didn’t wait to hear more. As he left, he called back, “Siddy, I’m going to get you for that.”"

He knew the model boy very well though—and loathed him.\nWithin two minutes, or even less, he had forgotten all his troubles. Not because his troubles were one whit less heavy and bitter to him than a man’s are to a man, but because a new and powerful interest bore them down and drove them out of his mind for the time—just as men’s misfortunes are forgotten in the excitement of new enterprises. This new interest was a valued novelty in whistling, which he had just acquired from a negro, and he was suffering to practise it undisturbed. It consisted in a peculiar bird-like turn, a sort of liquid warble, produced by touching the tongue to the roof of the mouth at short intervals in the midst of the music—the reader probably remembers how to do it, if he has ever been a boy. Diligence and attention soon gave him the knack of it, and he strode down the street with his mouth full of harmony and his soul full of gratitude.

Frustrated, he noted that she alternated between using white and black thread for sewing, making it impossible for him to keep track. He swore he would make Sid pay for it, declaring he would teach him a lesson. The text points out that Tom was not the exemplary boy of the village; he knew that type of boy quite well and despised him. Within moments, he had put all his troubles out of his mind. This wasn't because his difficulties were minor or less impactful to him than a man's are to an adult, but because a strong, new interest captured his attention, pushing the worries aside for the moment—just as people forget their troubles in the excitement of new activities. This new interest was a unique and prized method of whistling he had recently picked up from a negro, and he was desperate to practice it undisturbed. The technique created a peculiar, bird-like turn, a liquid warble, achieved by briefly touching the tongue to the palate while whistling—the author suggests the reader, if they were a boy, likely recalls how to do it. With practice and concentration, he quickly acquired the skill, and he walked down the street, creating beautiful sounds and feeling profoundly grateful. His feeling was much like that of an astronomer who has found a new planet—though, concerning pure, deep, unadulterated pleasure, the advantage was undoubtedly with the boy rather than the astronomer.",

He resolved to give Sid a pounding for getting him into trouble. Tom wasn’t the village’s ideal boy; in fact, he knew exactly who that was and disliked him intensely. Within a couple of minutes, Tom’s troubles faded from his mind—not because they weren’t serious to him, but because something new and fascinating had come along and pushed them out, just as adults often forget their problems when they get caught up in something new. Tom’s latest obsession was a whistling trick he had just learned from a black man: a special, melodic, bird-like sound made by touching his tongue to the roof of his mouth while whistling. With some practice, he quickly picked it up, and marched down the street whistling happily, full of gratitude—feeling as delighted as an astronomer who has found a new planet; in fact, in terms of pure joy, Tom had the better of it."

Anyone who accepts a dare is capable of stealing sheep.\" The new boy immediately stepped over the line and said, \"Alright, you said you'd do it, let's see you actually do it.\" Tom warned, \"Don't crowd me now; you better be careful.\" The other boy pressed, \"Well, you claimed you would—why aren't you doing it?\" \"By gum! I'll do it for two cents!\" Tom exclaimed. The new boy pulled two large copper coins from his pocket and mockingly held them out. Tom knocked them to the ground. Instantly, the boys were entangled, grappling in the dirt like wildcats, rolling and tumbling. For about a minute, they pulled and ripped at each other's hair and clothes, punched and scratched faces, covering themselves in dust but also a sense of victory. Soon, the chaos subsided, and Tom emerged from the scuffle, sitting on top of the new boy and hitting him with his fists. \"Yell 'enough'!\" Tom ordered. The boy simply struggled to break free, crying mostly out of pure anger. \"Yell 'enough'!\" Tom repeated, and the hitting continued.",

Tom demanded the other boy leave; the new boy told Tom to leave instead. Both refused to back down. They braced themselves and pushed against each other angrily, but neither could overpower his opponent. When they grew tired and cautiously eased up, Tom insulted the other boy, threatening to get his (imaginary) big brother to beat him up. The new boy boasted that his own (equally imaginary) brother was even bigger and would easily toss Tom’s brother over the fence. Calling each other liars, Tom marked a line in the dirt and dared the new boy to step over it, promising to beat him if he did and saying only a thief would take such a dare. The new boy immediately crossed the line and challenged Tom to make good on his threat. Tom hesitated, saying he would fight for two cents, so the new boy mockingly produced two coins. Tom knocked them away, and the two boys immediately started brawling, wrestling fiercely and roughing each other up as they rolled in the dirt. Eventually, Tom gained the upper hand, sitting on top of the other boy and hitting him, demanding that he surrender by saying ‘enough.’ The new boy struggled on, crying out of anger but refusing to give in as Tom continued to pummel him."

          "text_segment": "Saturday morning was come, and all the summer world was bright and fresh, and brimming with life. There was a song in every heart; and if the heart was young the music issued at the lips. There was cheer in every face and a spring in every step. The locust-trees were in bloom and the fragrance of the blossoms filled the air. Cardiff Hill, beyond the village and above it, was green with vegetation and it lay just far enough away to seem a Delectable Land, dreamy, reposeful, and inviting.\nTom appeared on the sidewalk with a bucket of whitewash and a long-handled brush. He surveyed the fence, and all gladness left him and a deep melancholy settled down upon his spirit. Thirty yards of board fence nine feet high. Life to him seemed hollow, and existence but a burden. Sighing, he dipped his brush and passed it along the topmost plank; repeated the operation; did it again; compared the insignificant whitewashed streak with the far-reaching continent of unwhitewashed fence, and sat down on a tree-box discouraged. Jim came skipping out at the gate with a tin pail, and singing Buffalo Gals. Bringing water from the town pump had always been hateful work in Tom’s eyes, before, but now it did not strike him so. He remembered that there was company at the pump. White, mulatto, and negro boys and girls were always there waiting their turns, resting, trading playthings, quarrelling, fighting, skylarking. And he remembered that although the pump was only a hundred and fifty yards off, Jim never got back with a bucket of water under an hour—and even then somebody generally had to go after him. Tom said:\n“Say, Jim, I’ll fetch the water if you’ll whitewash some.”\nJim shook his head and said:\n“Can’t, Mars Tom. Ole missis, she tole me I got to go an’ git dis water an’ not stop foolin’ roun’ wid anybody. She say she spec’ Mars Tom gwine to ax me to whitewash, an’ so she tole me go ’long an’ ’tend to my own business—she ’lowed she’d ’tend to de whitewashin’.”\n“Oh, never you mind what she said, Jim. That’s the way she always talks. Gimme the bucket—I won’t be gone only a a minute. She won’t ever know.”\n“Oh, I dasn’t, Mars Tom. Ole missis she’d take an’ tar de head off’n me. ’Deed she would.”\n“She! She never licks anybody—whacks ’em over the head with her thimble—and who cares for that, I’d like to know. She talks awful, but talk don’t hurt—anyways it don’t if she don’t cry. Jim, I’ll give you a marvel. I’ll give you a white alley!”\nJim began to waver.\n“White alley, Jim! And it’s a bully taw.”\n“My! Dat’s a mighty gay marvel, I tell you! But Mars Tom I’s powerful ’fraid ole missis—”\n“And besides, if you will I’ll show you my sore toe.”\nJim was only human—this attraction was too much for him. He put down his pail, took the white alley, and bent over the toe with absorbing interest while the bandage was being unwound. In another moment he was flying down the street with his pail and a tingling rear, Tom was whitewashing with vigor, and Aunt Polly was retiring from the field with a slipper in her hand and triumph in her eye.",
          "paraphrase_gemini-2.5-flash-preview-04-17": "Saturday arrived, ushering in a bright, cheerful summer day full of life. Everyone felt joyful; for young people, this happiness spilled over into song. Faces were happy, and steps were lively. The air was filled with the sweet scent of blooming locust trees. Cardiff Hill, located beyond and above the village, was covered in green plants and was just far enough away to appear like a desirable, peaceful, and inviting place. Tom appeared on the sidewalk, carrying a bucket of whitewash and a brush with a long handle. He looked at the fence, and all his happiness vanished, replaced by deep sadness. It was a board fence, thirty yards long and nine feet high. To him, life suddenly felt empty, and existence seemed like a burden. With a sigh, he dipped his brush and applied a stroke to the top board; he did it again; then a third time; he compared the small strip of whitewash to the vast, unpainted expanse of the fence and sat down on a nearby tree-box, feeling completely defeated. Jim came skipping through the gate, holding a tin pail and singing 'Buffalo Gals'. Fetching water from the town pump had always been a chore Tom disliked intensely, but now it didn't seem so bad. He remembered that the pump was a social spot. White, mixed-race, and Black children were always there, waiting their turn, resting, trading items, arguing, fighting, and playing around. He also recalled that even though the pump was only 150 yards away, Jim never returned with a bucket of water in under an hour – and usually, someone had to be sent to find him. Tom said, \"Hey, Jim, I'll go get the water if you'll do some whitewashing.\" Jim shook his head and replied, \"No, Mars Tom. Old missus told me I have to go and get this water and not waste time fooling around with anyone. She said she expected Mars Tom to ask me to whitewash, so she told me to go ahead and mind my own business – she said she would take care of the whitewashing herself.\" \"Oh, don't pay attention to what she said, Jim. She always talks like that. Give me the bucket – I'll only be gone a minute. She'll never find out.\" \"Oh, I wouldn't dare, Mars Tom. Old missus would tear my head off. She really would.\" \"She! She never actually hits anyone – she just taps them on the head with her thimble – and who cares about that, I'd like to know. She talks awfully, but talk doesn't hurt – at least not if she doesn't cry. Jim, I'll give you a marble. I'll give you a white alley!\" Jim started to hesitate. \"A white alley, Jim! And it's a great shooter.\" \"Wow! That's a really nice marble, I tell you! But Mars Tom, I'm really scared of old missus –\" \"And besides, if you do it, I'll show you my sore toe.\" Jim was only human – this offer was too tempting. He set down his pail, accepted the white alley, and leaned over the toe with great interest as the bandage was removed. A moment later, he was running down the street with his pail and a stinging backside, Tom was diligently whitewashing, and Aunt Polly was leaving the scene with a slipper in her hand and a look of triumph in her eye.",
          "paraphrase_gpt-4.1-2025-04-14": "It was Saturday morning, and the world looked bright, lively, and full of promise. Everyone seemed cheerful, and the young especially could not help but express their happiness aloud. The air smelled sweet from the blooming locust trees, and Cardiff Hill, just outside the village, looked lush and enchanting, almost magical in its serene beauty.\n\nTom came out to the sidewalk carrying a bucket of whitewash and a long brush. He looked over the fence he had to paint, and his happiness disappeared, replaced by a heavy sadness. The fence was long and tall, and the job seemed endless and draining to him. He sighed and started painting, but when he saw how little progress he made compared to the remaining unpainted fence, he became discouraged and sat down, feeling dejected.\n\nAt that moment, Jim appeared, cheerfully carrying a bucket and singing. Normally, Tom disliked bringing water from the town pump, but now, seeing Jim about to do that task, he remembered that fetching water meant socializing with the other children who gathered at the pump. Tom realized Jim usually took a long time at this chore, so he tried to convince Jim to switch places with him—Tom would get the water while Jim painted the fence. Jim refused, saying that Aunt Polly had specifically told him not to get distracted and certainly not to help with the whitewashing. Tom tried to bribe Jim with a pretty marble and the chance to see his sore toe. Tempted by the marble, Jim hesitated, but when the promise of seeing the sore toe was added, Jim’s resistance collapsed. While Jim investigated Tom's toe, Aunt Polly caught them, chased Jim off with a slap, and left Tom to his painting task, proud of her authority. Tom, meanwhile, resumed his work with renewed energy."

He was eating an apple, and giving a long, melodious whoop, at intervals, followed by a deep-toned ding-dong-dong, ding-dong-dong, for he was personating a steamboat. As he drew near, he slackened speed, took the middle of the street, leaned far over to starboard and rounded to ponderously and with laborious pomp and circumstance—for he was personating the Big Missouri, and considered himself to be drawing nine feet of water. He was boat and captain and engine-bells combined, so he had to imagine himself standing on his own hurricane-deck giving the orders and executing them:\n“Stop her, sir! Ting-a-ling-ling!” The headway ran almost out, and he drew up slowly toward the sidewalk.\n“Ship up to back! Ting-a-ling-ling!” His arms straightened and stiffened down his sides.\n“Set her back on the stabboard! Ting-a-ling-ling! Chow! ch-chow-wow! Chow!” His right hand, mean-time, describing stately circles—for it was representing a forty-foot wheel.\n“Let her go back on the labboard! Ting-a-ling-ling! Chow-ch-chow-chow!” The left hand began to describe circles.\n“Stop the stabboard! Ting-a-ling-ling! Stop the labboard! Come ahead on the stabboard! Stop her! Let your outside turn over slow! Ting-a-ling-ling! Chow-ow-ow! Get out that head-line! lively now! Come—out with your spring-line—what’re you about there! Take a turn round that stump with the bight of it! Stand by that stage, now—let her go! Done with the engines, sir! Ting-a-ling-ling! SH’T! S’H’T! SH’T!” (trying the gauge-cocks).\nTom went on whitewashing—paid no attention to the steamboat. Ben stared a moment and then said: “Hi-Yi! You’re up a stump, ain’t you!”\nNo answer. Tom surveyed his last touch with the eye of an artist, then he gave his brush another gentle sweep and surveyed the result, as before. Ben ranged up alongside of him. Tom’s mouth watered for the apple, but he stuck to his work. Ben said:\n“Hello, old chap, you got to work, hey?”\nTom wheeled suddenly and said:\n“Why, it’s you, Ben! I warn’t noticing.”\n“Say—I’m going in a-swimming, I am. Don’t you wish you could? But of course you’d druther work—wouldn’t you? Course you would!”\nTom contemplated the boy a bit, and said:\n“What do you call work?”\n“Why, ain’t that work?”\nTom resumed his whitewashing, and answered carelessly:\n“Well, maybe it is, and maybe it ain’t. All I know, is, it suits Tom Sawyer.”\n“Oh come, now, you don’t mean to let on that you like it?”\nThe brush continued to move.\n“Like it? Well, I don’t see why I oughtn’t to like it. Does a boy get a chance to whitewash a fence every day?”",
          "paraphrase_gemini-2.5-flash-preview-04-17": "He picked up his brush and calmly got to work. Ben Rogers soon appeared—the very boy, above all others, whose mocking he had been dreading. Ben was skipping and hopping, clear evidence that he was cheerful and anticipating fun. He was eating an apple and letting out long, musical yells now and then, followed by deep, resonant 'ding-dong-dong' sounds, because he was pretending to be a steamboat. As he got closer, he slowed down, moved to the middle of the street, leaned heavily to the right side, and turned slowly and grandly with elaborate effort, as he was imitating the large steamboat, the Big Missouri, and imagined he needed nine feet of water depth. He was simultaneously the boat, the captain, and the engine bells, so he had to picture himself standing on his own upper deck, issuing and following the commands: \"Stop her, sir!\" accompanied by bell sounds. The boat almost stopped its forward motion and slowly drifted towards the sidewalk. \"Prepare to reverse!\" with bell sounds. His arms stiffened and straightened along his sides. \"Back up using the starboard engine! Engine sounds!\" Meanwhile, his right hand was making grand circular motions, representing a forty-foot paddle wheel. \"Now back up with the larboard engine! Engine sounds!\" His left hand began making circles too. \"Stop the starboard! Bell! Stop the larboard! Move forward on the starboard! Stop her! Let your outside wheel turn slowly! Bell! Engine sounds! Get the front rope ready! Hurry now! Bring out your spring line—what are you doing over there! Wrap the loop of it around that stump! Get ready by that stage! Let her go! Finished with the engines, sir! Bell! (mimicking the sounds of testing the steam valves).\" Tom continued whitewashing, paying no attention to the steamboat performance. Ben stared for a moment and then said, \"Hey there! Looks like you're stuck with a difficult job, aren't you!\" There was no reply. Tom examined his latest stroke with the keen eye of an artist, then gave his brush another gentle sweep and studied the result, just as before. Ben came up beside him. Tom's mouth watered for the apple, but he focused on his task. Ben said, \"Hello, pal, forced to work, huh?\" Tom turned suddenly and said, \"Why, it's you, Ben! I wasn't paying attention.\" \"Listen—I'm going swimming. Wish you could join? But I guess you'd rather work—wouldn't you? Of course you would!\" Tom observed the boy for a bit, and then asked, \"What do you define as 'work'?\" \"Why, isn't *that* work?\" Tom returned to his whitewashing, and answered casually, \"Well, maybe it is, and maybe it isn't. All I know is, Tom Sawyer finds it agreeable.\" \"Oh come on now, you don't mean to pretend that you *like* it?\" The brush kept moving. \"Like it? Well, I don't see why I shouldn't like it. How often does a boy get the chance to whitewash a fence?\"",
          "paraphrase_gpt-4.1-2025-04-14": "He picked up his brush and calmly started painting. Soon Ben Rogers appeared—the very boy whose teasing Tom had been nervous about. Ben was moving along playfully, clearly in a good mood and excited. He was munching on an apple and every so often let out a long, cheerful shout, followed by deep, rhythmic sounds, pretending to be a steamboat. As he got closer, he slowed down, took the center of the street, leaned dramatically to one side, and stopped as if maneuvering a large vessel—for he was pretending to be the Big Missouri riverboat, imagining himself as both boat and captain while giving orders and acting them out. \n\n“Stop her, sir! Ting-a-ling-ling!” The boat slowed almost to a halt as he neared the sidewalk. \n\n“Reverse! Ting-a-ling-ling!” His arms stiffened at his sides.\n\n“Back up on the starboard side! Ting-a-ling-ling! Chow! ch-chow-wow! Chow!” As he spun his right hand in large circles to imitate the paddlewheel.\n\n“Reverse on the port side! Ting-a-ling-ling! Chow-ch-chow-chow!” Now his left hand moved in circles.\n\n“Stop starboard! Ting-a-ling-ling! Stop port! Move forward on starboard! Halt! Turn the outer wheel slow! Ting-a-ling-ling! Chow-ow-ow! Get the bow line out quick! Come on—where’s your spring line? Tie it off around the stump! Get ready at the stage—let her go! Engines off, sir! Ting-a-ling-ling! SH’T! S’H’T! SH’T!” (pretending to check the gauges).\n\nTom kept whitewashing, ignoring Ben’s performance. Ben watched him for a while, then said, “Hey there! Looks like you’re in trouble, huh!”\n\nTom didn’t answer. He carefully added a touch of paint, looking at his work with an artist’s eye, then brushed another stroke and admired it again. Ben came up beside him. Tom wished for the apple, but kept on painting. Ben said:\n\n“Hey, old fellow, you have to work, huh?”\n\nTom spun around and replied:\n\n“Why, it’s you, Ben! I didn’t even notice.”\n\n“I’m going swimming. Don’t you wish you could? But I bet you’d rather be working, wouldn’t you? Of course you would!”\n\nTom considered Ben for a moment, then asked:\n\n“What do you call work?”\n\n“Isn’t that work?”\n\nTom went back to painting and answered casually:\n\n“Maybe it is, maybe it isn’t. What I know is, it suits Tom Sawyer.”\n\n“Oh come on, you don’t mean to say you like it?”\n\nTom kept painting.\n\n“Like it? Well, why shouldn’t I like it? It’s not every day a boy gets a chance to whitewash a fence.”"

Presently he said:\n“Say, Tom, let me whitewash a little.”\nTom considered, was about to consent; but he altered his mind:\n“No—no—I reckon it wouldn’t hardly do, Ben. You see, Aunt Polly’s awful particular about this fence—right here on the street, you know—but if it was the back fence I wouldn’t mind and she wouldn’t.

He stopped eating his apple and watched as Tom handled the brush delicately, moving it back and forth, then stepping back to check the outcome. Tom made minor adjustments, then critically reviewed his work again, all while Ben observed his every action, becoming increasingly captivated and interested. After a moment, Ben spoke up: \"Hey, Tom, could I try whitewashing just a little?\" Tom seemed to think about it, almost agreeing, but then changed his mind. \"No, no, I really don't think that would be wise, Ben. You see, Aunt Polly is terribly particular about this fence—especially since it's right along the street. If it were the back fence, I wouldn't mind, and neither would she. But yes, she's extremely fussy about this one; it absolutely has to be done with great care. I honestly doubt there's even one boy in a thousand, maybe two thousand, who could do it correctly.\" \"Seriously? Is it that hard? Oh, come on, just let me have a go. Just for a short time. If I were in your shoes, Tom, I'd let you.\" \"Ben, honestly, I'd truly like to let you, but Aunt Polly... Look, Jim wanted to do it, but she refused him, and when Sid asked, she turned him down too. Can't you see the position I'm in? If you started working on this fence and something went wrong...\" \"Oh, forget about it, I'll be super careful. Please, just let me try. Say, I'll give you the core of my apple.\" \"Well, listen... No, Ben, don't do that. I'm worried...\" \"I'll give you the whole thing!\" Tom reluctantly handed over the brush, his face showing hesitation while his heart leaped with excitement. And so, while Ben, metaphorically like the hardworking steamer Big Missouri, labored and sweated under the sun, the cunning trickster sat comfortably on a barrel nearby in the shade, swinging his legs, enjoying his apple, and planning how to ensnare more innocent victims.",
          "paraphrase_gpt-4.1-2025-04-14": "Ben paused his apple-eating, seeing things differently now. Tom carefully moved the brush, pausing to inspect his progress, making small adjustments, and evaluating his work, all while Ben watched intently, becoming increasingly fascinated. After a bit, Ben asked, “Hey, Tom, can I try painting a bit?” Tom hesitated, ready to agree, but changed his mind: “No, Ben, I don’t think that’s a good idea. Aunt Polly is really picky about this fence—it’s the one facing the street. If it was the back fence, it’d be fine, but she wants this one done perfectly. I doubt there’s more than one boy in a thousand, maybe two thousand, who could do it right.” Ben, surprised, pleaded, “Really? Come on, just let me try a little. You’d let me if you were me, Tom.” Tom replied, “Honestly, I wish I could, but Aunt Polly wouldn’t let Jim do it, and she wouldn’t let Sid either. See how it is? If something went wrong—” Ben insisted, “I’ll be super careful. Let me try. I’ll even give you the core of my apple.” Tom hesitated again, “No, Ben, I’m not sure—” Ben made a better offer: “I’ll give you the whole apple!” Finally, Tom reluctantly handed over the brush, though inside he was delighted.

How much of it have you done?\" \"It's all finished, Aunt.\" \"Tom, don't lie to me—I can't stand it.\" \"I'm not, Aunt; it truly is all done.\" Aunt Polly had little faith in his word. She went outside to check for herself, expecting to find maybe twenty percent of his claim to be true. When she saw that the entire fence was not only whitewashed but thickly painted over and over, with even a little paint added to the ground, her shock was almost indescribable. She exclaimed, \"Well, I'll be! There's no denying it, you can work when you decide to, Tom.\" She then lessened the praise by adding, \"But I have to say, it's very rarely that you feel like it. Alright, go on and play; but make sure you're back sometime within a week, or I'll spank you.\" She was so impressed by how well he had done that she took him to the pantry, selected a special apple, and gave it to him. She also gave him a lecture about how much better and more satisfying a treat felt when it was earned honestly through virtuous effort. While she finished with a happy Bible quote, he secretly snatched a doughnut.",

The gentle summer breeze, the peaceful silence, the fragrance of flowers, and the soft buzzing of bees had a calming effect, causing her to doze as she knitted. She had only the cat, which was asleep in her lap, for company, and her glasses were safely perched atop her gray hair. Aunt Polly, assuming Tom would have run off by now, was surprised to see him bravely return and stand before her. Tom asked if he could go play. Aunt Polly was skeptical and questioned how much he had done. Tom replied the work was finished, but she doubted his honesty. Tom insisted he was telling the truth, so Aunt Polly went out to check for herself. She would have settled for only part of his claim being true, but to her amazement, she found the entire fence had been thoroughly whitewashed, with multiple coats and even some touching up on the ground. Nearly speechless, she admitted that Tom could work hard when he wanted to, although it didn't happen often. She told him to go play, jokingly warning him not to disappear for a week or she'd punish him. Impressed by his accomplishment, she gave him a specially chosen apple and a lecture about how rewards are better when they're earned honestly. While she finished with a cheerful biblical quote, Tom slyly took a doughnut."

He presently got safely beyond the reach of capture and punishment, and hastened toward the public square of the village, where two “military” companies of boys had met for conflict, according to previous appointment. Tom was General of one of these armies, Joe Harper (a bosom friend) General of the other. These two great commanders did not condescend to fight in person—that being better suited to the still smaller fry—but sat together on an eminence and conducted the field operations by orders delivered through aides-de-camp.

Tom went around the block and entered a muddy passage that ran past the back of his aunt’s cow stable.

There, two groups of boys, organized like military units, had gathered for a planned conflict. Tom commanded one of these armies, while Joe Harper, a close friend, commanded the other. These two senior commanders did not participate in the fighting themselves – that was better suited for the younger boys – but instead sat together on a raised spot and managed the battle through messengers who delivered their orders.

Although there was a gate, Tom usually found himself too rushed to bother with it. Now that he had paid Sid back for drawing attention to his black thread and getting him in trouble, Tom felt content. He circled the block and slipped into a muddy alley near his aunt's cow-stable. Safely out of reach from any punishment, he hurried off toward the village square, where two groups of boys—serving as imaginary armies—were assembled for a scheduled battle. Tom was the leader of one side, with his close friend Joe Harper heading the other. The two leaders didn’t join the fighting themselves, leaving that to the younger boys, but instead sat on a rise and directed the battle by sending orders through messengers. Tom’s side emerged victorious after an intense, extended fight. Afterward, they counted the pretend casualties, exchanged prisoners, agreed on the terms of their next battle, and set a date for it.

The potent palm was uplifted to strike again when Tom cried out:\n“Hold on, now, what ’er you belting me for?—Sid broke it!”\nAunt Polly paused, perplexed, and Tom looked for healing pity. But when she got her tongue again, she only said:\n“Umf! Well, you didn’t get a lick amiss, I reckon. You been into some other audacious mischief when I wasn’t around, like enough.”\nThen her conscience reproached her, and she yearned to say something kind and loving; but she judged that this would be construed into a confession that she had been in the wrong, and discipline forbade that. So she kept silence, and went about her affairs with a troubled heart. Tom sulked in a corner and exalted his woes. He knew that in her heart his aunt was on her knees to him, and he was morosely gratified by the consciousness of it. He would hang out no signals, he would take notice of none. He knew that a yearning glance fell upon him, now and then, through a film of tears, but he refused recognition of it. He pictured himself lying sick unto death and his aunt bending over him beseeching one little forgiving word, but he would turn his face to the wall, and die with that word unsaid. Ah, how would she feel then? And he pictured himself brought home from the river, dead, with his curls all wet, and his sore heart at rest. How she would throw herself upon him, and how her tears would fall like rain, and her lips pray God to give her back her boy and she would never, never abuse him any more! But he would lie there cold and white and make no sign—a poor little sufferer, whose griefs were at an end. He so worked upon his feelings with the pathos of these dreams, that he had to keep swallowing, he was so like to choke; and his eyes swam in a blur of water, which overflowed when he winked, and ran down and trickled from the end of his nose. And such a luxury to him was this petting of his sorrows, that he could not bear to have any worldly cheeriness or any grating delight intrude upon it; it was too sacred for such contact; and so, presently, when his cousin Mary danced in, all alive with the joy of seeing home again after an age-long visit of one week to the country, he got up and moved in clouds and darkness out at one door as she brought song and sunshine in at the other.",

Aunt Polly's hand was raised to hit him again when Tom shouted, \"Wait a minute, why are you hitting me?! Sid broke it!\" Aunt Polly stopped, looking puzzled, and Tom hoped for sympathy. But when she could speak again, she just said, \"Hmmph! Well, you probably deserved it anyway. You've likely gotten into plenty of other trouble when I wasn't around.\" Afterwards, her conscience troubled her, and she felt a strong urge to say something comforting and loving; but she decided that doing so would be seen as admitting her mistake, and the rules of discipline prevented that. So, she remained quiet and went about her business with a heavy heart. Tom went to a corner to mope, feeling pleased with his suffering. He knew that deep down, his aunt was feeling apologetic towards him, and he was grimly satisfied by this knowledge. He wouldn't give any sign of response, nor would he acknowledge any of hers. He was aware that she was casting a sorrowful glance his way occasionally, with tears in her eyes, but he chose not to notice. He imagined himself desperately ill, close to death, and his aunt leaning over him, begging for a single word of forgiveness, but he would turn his face away and die without speaking that word. Oh, how awful she would feel then! And he pictured himself being carried home from the river, lifeless, with his hair soaked and his troubled heart finally at peace. He imagined how she would collapse onto him, how her tears would stream down like rain, and how she would pray to God to return her boy, promising never, ever to mistreat him again! But he would lie there, cold and pale, completely still—a poor little victim whose pain was now over. He indulged in these sad fantasies so intensely that he had to swallow repeatedly to avoid choking, and his eyes welled up with tears that spilled over when he blinked, running down his cheeks and dripping from his nose. This dwelling on his sorrows was such a comfort to him that he couldn't stand any cheerful or annoying happiness interfering with it; it was too precious for such interruptions; and so, when his cousin Mary soon skipped in, full of excitement about being home after what felt like ages (though it was only a week-long visit to the countryside), he got up and exited gloomily through one door just as she brought joy and sunlight in through the other.",

But when she regained her speech, all she said was, \"Hmm! Well, you probably deserved that. You’re always getting into trouble when I’m not looking.\" Then she felt guilty, and wanted to say something kind, but worried it would seem like admitting she was wrong, and her principles wouldn’t allow that. So she stayed quiet, doing her chores with a heavy heart. Tom sat sulking in a corner, feeling sorry for himself. He believed his aunt was inwardly begging for his forgiveness, and this thought made him grimly satisfied. He refused to show any sign of forgiveness or to notice her. He imagined her sneaking sad glances at him through tear-filled eyes, but he ignored her. He pictured himself gravely ill, with his aunt begging him for one forgiving word, but he would turn away and die without saying it. How sad she’d be then! He even imagined himself drowned and brought home, lifeless, as his aunt wept and prayed for him to come back, swearing she’d never treat him badly again—but he would remain cold and unresponsive, his suffering over. So deeply did Tom wallow in these sad fantasies that he nearly choked up, his eyes filled with tears that spilled over and ran down his nose. To him, feeling his own sorrow was such a comfort that he couldn’t stand any happiness or noise around him; it felt too precious for interruption. So, when his cousin Mary came in full of joy after being away for what seemed a long time, Tom got up and left the room somberly just as she came in singing and cheerful."

Breakfast over, Aunt Polly had family worship: it began with a prayer built from the ground up of solid courses of Scriptural quotations, welded together with a thin mortar of originality; and from the summit of this she delivered a grim chapter of the Mosaic Law, as from Sinai.\nThen Tom girded up his loins, so to speak, and went to work to “get his verses.” Sid had learned his lesson days before. Tom bent all his energies to the memorizing of five verses, and he chose part of the Sermon on the Mount, because he could find no verses that were shorter. At the end of half an hour Tom had a vague general idea of his lesson, but no more, for his mind was traversing the whole field of human thought, and his hands were busy with distracting recreations. Mary took his book to hear him recite, and he tried to find his way through the fog:\n“Blessed are the—a—a—”\n“Poor”—\n“Yes—poor; blessed are the poor—a—a—”\n“In spirit—”\n“In spirit; blessed are the poor in spirit, for they—they—”\n“Theirs—”\n“For theirs.

Blessed are they that mourn, for they—they—”\n“Sh—”\n“For they—a—”\n“S, H, A—”\n“For they S, H—Oh, I don’t know what it is!”\n“Shall!”\n“Oh, shall! for they shall—for they shall—a—a—shall mourn—a—a—blessed are they that shall—they that—a—they that shall mourn, for they shall—a—shall what? Why don’t you tell me, Mary?—what do you want to be so mean for?”\n“Oh, Tom, you poor thick-headed thing, I’m not teasing you. I wouldn’t do that. You must go and learn it again. Don’t you be discouraged, Tom, you’ll manage it—and if you do, I’ll give you something ever so nice. There, now, that’s a good boy.”\n“All right! What is it, Mary, tell me what it is.”\n“Never you mind, Tom. You know if I say it’s nice, it is nice.”\n“You bet you that’s so, Mary. All right, I’ll tackle it again.”\nAnd he did “tackle it again”—and under the double pressure of curiosity and prospective gain he did it with such spirit that he accomplished a shining success. Mary gave him a brand-new “Barlow” knife worth twelve and a half cents; and the convulsion of delight that swept his system shook him to his foundations. True, the knife would not cut anything, but it was a “sure-enough” Barlow, and there was inconceivable grandeur in that—though where the Western boys ever got the idea that such a weapon could possibly be counterfeited to its injury is an imposing mystery and will always remain so, perhaps. Tom contrived to scarify the cupboard with it, and was arranging to begin on the bureau, when he was called off to dress for Sunday-school.",
          "paraphrase_gemini-2.5-flash-preview-04-17": "The sun appeared on a peaceful world, its rays shining down on the quiet village like a blessing. Once breakfast was finished, Aunt Polly conducted family worship. It began with a prayer constructed primarily from numerous Scriptural quotes, joined together with just a small amount of her own wording. Following the prayer, she read a strict chapter of the laws of Moses, delivering it with the authority of Mount Sinai. Then, metaphorically speaking, Tom braced himself to study his Bible verses. Sid had already learned his lessons days earlier. Tom put all his effort into memorizing five verses, choosing a section of the Sermon on the Mount because he couldn't find any shorter ones. After thirty minutes, Tom had only a fuzzy understanding of his lesson, as his mind was wandering through every conceivable thought, and his hands were busy with activities that distracted him. Mary took his book to listen to his recitation, and he struggled to make his way through the verses as if through a dense fog. When he stumbled, starting with 'Blessed are the—a—a—', Mary prompted 'Poor'. He repeated 'Yes—poor; blessed are the poor—a—a—', prompting Mary again 'In spirit—'. He followed 'In spirit; blessed are the poor in spirit, for they—they—', leading to Mary's help 'Theirs—'. He then got 'For theirs. Blessed are the poor in spirit, for theirs is the kingdom of heaven. Blessed are they that mourn, for they—they—'. When he paused again, Mary tried to sound out the beginning of the next word 'Sh—'. He was still lost 'For they—a—'. Mary then spelled it out 'S, H, A—'. Frustrated, he exclaimed 'For they S, H—Oh, I don’t know what it is!'. Mary supplied the word 'Shall!'. Relieved, he repeated 'Oh, shall! for they shall—for they shall—a—a—shall mourn—a—a—blessed are they that shall—they that—a—they that shall mourn, for they shall—a—shall what? Why don’t you tell me, Mary?—what do you want to be so mean for?'. Mary gently replied 'Oh, Tom, you poor thick-headed thing, I’m not teasing you. I wouldn’t do that. You must go and learn it again. Don’t you be discouraged, Tom, you’ll manage it—and if you do, I’ll give you something ever so nice. There, now, that’s a good boy.'. Tom eagerly asked 'All right! What is it, Mary, tell me what it is.'. Mary kept it a secret, saying 'Never you mind, Tom. You know if I say it’s nice, it is nice.'. Tom confidently agreed 'You bet you that’s so, Mary. All right, I’ll tackle it again.'. And he did 'tackle it again'. Driven by both curiosity and the prospect of a reward, he approached the task with such energy that he achieved complete success. Mary presented him with a brand-new 'Barlow' knife, valued at twelve and a half cents. The rush of happiness that went through him was so strong it deeply affected him. It's true the knife couldn't cut anything, but it was a genuine Barlow, and that fact held unimaginable importance – although why boys in the West believed such a tool could be imitated to the point of damage remains a significant puzzle, perhaps forever. Tom managed to scratch the cupboard with it and was getting ready to start on the chest of drawers when he was called away to prepare for Sunday school.",

Why don’t you tell me, Mary? What are you being so mean for?\"\n\n\"Oh, Tom, you silly thing, I’m not teasing you. I would never do that. You just need to go back and learn it again. Don’t be discouraged, Tom—you’ll get it, and if you do, I’ll give you a really nice surprise. There, that’s a good boy.\"\n\n\"Okay! What is it, Mary, tell me what it is.\"\n\n\"Never mind, Tom. If I say it’s nice, you’ll see it is.\"\n\n\"I trust you, Mary. Alright, I’ll try again.\"\n\nAnd Tom did try again—with the extra motivation of curiosity and the promise of a reward, he worked hard and finally succeeded. Mary rewarded him with a new Barlow knife worth twelve and a half cents, and Tom was so delighted he could barely contain himself. The knife couldn’t cut much, but it was a real Barlow, and Tom felt incredibly proud to own it, regardless of the mystery of how such knives might ever be imitated. He promptly scratched the cupboard with his new knife and was getting ready to move on to the bureau when he was called away to get dressed for Sunday school."

But Mary removed the towel and said:\n“Now ain’t you ashamed, Tom. You mustn’t be so bad. Water won’t hurt you.”\nTom was a trifle disconcerted. The basin was refilled, and this time he stood over it a little while, gathering resolution; took in a big breath and began. When he entered the kitchen presently, with both eyes shut and groping for the towel with his hands, an honorable testimony of suds and water was dripping from his face. But when he emerged from the towel, he was not yet satisfactory, for the clean territory stopped short at his chin and his jaws, like a mask; below and beyond this line there was a dark expanse of unirrigated soil that spread downward in front and backward around his neck. Mary took him in hand, and when she was done with him he was a man and a brother, without distinction of color, and his saturated hair was neatly brushed, and its short curls wrought into a dainty and symmetrical general effect. [He privately smoothed out the curls, with labor and difficulty, and plastered his hair close down to his head; for he held curls to be effeminate, and his own filled his life with bitterness.] Then Mary got out a suit of his clothing that had been used only on Sundays during two years—they were simply called his “other clothes”—and so by that we know the size of his wardrobe. The girl “put him to rights” after he had dressed himself; she buttoned his neat roundabout up to his chin, turned his vast shirt collar down over his shoulders, brushed him off and crowned him with his speckled straw hat. He now looked exceedingly improved and uncomfortable. He was fully as uncomfortable as he looked; for there was a restraint about whole clothes and cleanliness that galled him. He hoped that Mary would forget his shoes, but the hope was blighted; she coated them thoroughly with tallow, as was the custom, and brought them out. He lost his temper and said he was always being made to do everything he didn’t want to do. But Mary said, persuasively:\n“Please, Tom—that’s a good boy.”\nSo he got into the shoes snarling.

He took them outdoors, placed the basin on a small bench, wet the soap, set it down, rolled up his sleeves, gently emptied the water onto the ground, and then returned to the kitchen to energetically rub his face with the towel behind the door. Mary, however, removed the towel and chided, “Aren’t you ashamed, Tom? You shouldn’t behave so poorly. Water won’t harm you.” Tom felt slightly flustered. The basin was refilled, and this time he paused over it, gathering courage; he took a deep breath and began the washing process properly. When he re-entered the kitchen shortly after, eyes shut and hands searching for the towel, clear evidence of soap and water streamed down his face. Yet, after using the towel, he still wasn’t entirely clean; the clean area stopped abruptly at his chin and jawline, looking like a mask, while below and around his neck was a wide area of untouched dirt that extended downwards in front and wrapped around his neck. Mary took charge of him, and once she was finished, he was thoroughly clean and uniform in appearance, his wet hair neatly combed, the short curls styled into a pleasing and balanced look. [He secretly worked hard and painstakingly to flatten the curls, pressing his hair tightly against his head, because he considered curls unmanly and his own caused him considerable distress.] Then Mary retrieved a suit of his clothes that had only been worn on Sundays for the past two years—referred to simply as his “other clothes”—which indicates the limited size of his wardrobe. After he dressed, Mary tidied him up; she fastened his smart jacket all the way to his chin, arranged his large shirt collar over his shoulders, brushed him off, and placed his spotted straw hat on his head. He now appeared greatly improved but highly uncomfortable. He felt exactly as uncomfortable as he looked, as the constraint of clean, formal clothes irritated him. He hoped Mary would overlook his shoes, but his hope was dashed; following tradition, she generously coated them with tallow and brought them out. He became angry, complaining that he was always being forced to do things he didn't want to do. But Mary gently coaxed, “Please, Tom—be a good boy.” So he put the shoes on, muttering resentfully. Mary was soon ready, and the three children headed for Sunday school—a place Tom utterly despised, though Sid and Mary enjoyed it.",

However, Mary took the towel away, scolding him, 'Aren’t you ashamed, Tom? You know water won’t hurt you.' Tom was a little unsettled, but the basin was filled again. This time he hesitated for a moment to build up courage, took a deep breath, and started washing properly. A little later, he came back inside with his eyes tightly shut, feeling for the towel while soap suds and water trickled down his face—a clear sign he’d finally washed up. Yet, after drying, it was clear he hadn’t been thorough: the clean area stopped at his chin and jaws, like a mask, leaving the rest of his face and neck still grimy. Mary took over, cleaning him properly; when she finished, Tom was fresh and tidy, his damp hair brushed into neat curls—though he quickly tried to flatten them, believing curls were too girlish and resenting his own. Mary then brought out his 'other clothes,' a set saved for Sundays for the past two years, indicating his limited wardrobe. Once Tom put them on, Mary made sure he looked neat, buttoning his jacket, arranging his large shirt collar, brushing him off, and placing his speckled straw hat on his head. Tom looked a lot tidier, but he felt just as uncomfortable, disliking the feeling of stiff, clean clothes. He hoped Mary might forget his shoes, but she didn’t—she polished them with tallow, which annoyed Tom, and he complained about being forced to do everything he disliked. Mary gently urged him, 'Please, Tom—be good,' so he reluctantly put on the shoes, grumbling.

          "text_segment": "Sabbath-school hours were from nine to half-past ten; and then church service. Two of the children always remained for the sermon voluntarily, and the other always remained too—for stronger reasons. The church’s high-backed, uncushioned pews would seat about three hundred persons; the edifice was but a small, plain affair, with a sort of pine board tree-box on top of it for a steeple. At the door Tom dropped back a step and accosted a Sunday-dressed comrade:\n“Say, Billy, got a yaller ticket?”\n“Yes.”\n“What’ll you take for her?”\n“What’ll you give?”\n“Piece of lickrish and a fish-hook.”\n“Less see ’em.”\nTom exhibited. They were satisfactory, and the property changed hands. Then Tom traded a couple of white alleys for three red tickets, and some small trifle or other for a couple of blue ones. He waylaid other boys as they came, and went on buying tickets of various colors ten or fifteen minutes longer. He entered the church, now, with a swarm of clean and noisy boys and girls, proceeded to his seat and started a quarrel with the first boy that came handy. The teacher, a grave, elderly man, interfered; then turned his back a moment and Tom pulled a boy’s hair in the next bench, and was absorbed in his book when the boy turned around; stuck a pin in another boy, presently, in order to hear him say “Ouch!” and got a new reprimand from his teacher. Tom’s whole class were of a pattern—restless, noisy, and troublesome. When they came to recite their lessons, not one of them knew his verses perfectly, but had to be prompted all along. However, they worried through, and each got his reward—in small blue tickets, each with a passage of Scripture on it; each blue ticket was pay for two verses of the recitation. Ten blue tickets equalled a red one, and could be exchanged for it; ten red tickets equalled a yellow one; for ten yellow tickets the superintendent gave a very plainly bound Bible (worth forty cents in those easy times) to the pupil. How many of my readers would have the industry and application to memorize two thousand verses, even for a Doré Bible? And yet Mary had acquired two Bibles in this way—it was the patient work of two years—and a boy of German parentage had won four or five. He once recited three thousand verses without stopping; but the strain upon his mental faculties was too great, and he was little better than an idiot from that day forth—a grievous misfortune for the school, for on great occasions, before company, the superintendent (as Tom expressed it) had always made this boy come out and “spread himself.” Only the older pupils managed to keep their tickets and stick to their tedious work long enough to get a Bible, and so the delivery of one of these prizes was a rare and noteworthy circumstance; the successful pupil was so great and conspicuous for that day that on the spot every scholar’s heart was fired with a fresh ambition that often lasted a couple of weeks. It is possible that Tom’s mental stomach had never really hungered for one of those prizes, but unquestionably his entire being had for many a day longed for the glory and the eclat that came with it.",
          "paraphrase_gemini-2.5-flash-preview-04-17": "Sunday school ran from nine o'clock until half-past ten, immediately followed by church service. Two of the children chose to stay for the sermon willingly, while the others were obliged to stay for more compelling reasons. The church building was a simple, small structure with unpadded, high-backed pews capable of seating about three hundred people, and a basic pine board box serving as a steeple on its roof. As they reached the entrance, Tom hung back slightly and spoke to a friend dressed in his Sunday best: \"Hey, Billy, do you have a yellow ticket?\" \"Yeah,\" Billy replied. \"What will you sell it for?\" Tom asked. \"What are you offering?\" was the response. \"A piece of licorice and a fish-hook,\" Tom said. \"Let me see them,\" Billy requested. Tom showed him the items, which were acceptable, and they completed the trade. Following this, Tom exchanged two white marbles for three red tickets and acquired a couple of blue ones for some other small item. He intercepted more boys as they arrived, purchasing various colored tickets for another ten to fifteen minutes. He then entered the church alongside a noisy crowd of clean boys and girls, found his seat, and immediately started a disagreement with the closest boy. The teacher, a serious, older man, intervened. When the teacher turned his back for a moment, Tom pulled the hair of a boy sitting in the row ahead, and was absorbed in his book when the boy turned around. Soon after, he poked another boy with a pin just to hear him react with an \"Ouch!\", resulting in another scolding from his teacher. Tom's classmates were all quite similar—fidgety, loud, and troublesome. When it was time to recite their lessons, none knew their verses perfectly and needed constant prompting. Despite this, they managed to get through it, and each received their reward: small blue tickets, each printed with a Bible verse. Each blue ticket was given for two correctly recited verses. Ten blue tickets could be swapped for a red one, and ten red tickets were worth a yellow one. If a student collected ten yellow tickets, the superintendent would award them a very plain Bible (worth about forty cents in those easy times). One might wonder how many modern readers would have the patience and dedication to memorize two thousand verses, even for a fancy Bible? Yet, Mary had earned two Bibles this way through consistent effort over two years, and a boy of German descent had won four or five. He famously recited three thousand verses in one sitting, but the mental strain was reportedly so great that he was left less than normal afterward—a significant loss for the school, as the superintendent (according to Tom) used to show him off on important occasions before visitors, having him \"spread himself.\" Only the more advanced students typically managed to save their tickets and persevere through the monotonous work long enough to get a Bible. Therefore, when one of these prizes was awarded, it was an unusual and notable event. The winning student enjoyed considerable fame and attention for the day, instantly igniting a renewed ambition in the hearts of all the other students, an ambition that often lasted for about two weeks. While Tom's mind likely never genuinely craved one of those Bibles, there is no doubt that his entire being had yearned for the accompanying glory and recognition for a long time.",
          "paraphrase_gpt-4.1-2025-04-14": "Sunday school lasted from nine until half past ten in the morning, followed by the church service. Two of the children always stayed for the sermon out of choice, while the third did so for more compelling reasons. The church itself was small and modest, with hard, high-backed pews that could seat about three hundred people, and a simple pine box steeple on its roof. As they arrived, Tom lagged behind and approached a friend dressed for Sunday. He asked Billy if he had a yellow ticket, and when Billy confirmed, Tom offered him some licorice and a fish-hook in exchange. Satisfied with the deal, Billy handed over the ticket. Tom continued trading, exchanging marbles for other colored tickets, buying as many as he could from other boys for about ten or fifteen minutes. Eventually, he entered the church with a crowd of tidy but boisterous children and went to his seat, where he immediately started arguing with a nearby boy. Their teacher, an older, serious man, stopped them, but when his back was turned Tom caused more mischief, such as pulling a boy's hair and poking another with a pin, attracting further reprimands. Tom's classmates were just as restless and unruly, and when it came time to recite their lessons, none knew their verses completely and had to be helped throughout. They eventually managed to finish and, as a reward, got small blue tickets with Bible verses on them. Each blue ticket was for two memorized verses, and ten blue tickets could be traded for a red one; ten reds equaled a yellow, and ten yellow tickets could be exchanged for a simply bound Bible, worth about forty cents at the time. Memorizing two thousand verses to earn such a prize was quite a feat, yet Mary had managed to win two Bibles in this way over two years, and a German boy had even gotten four or five, at one point reciting three thousand verses at once—which unfortunately left him mentally affected. Having a Bible awarded was rare and special, making the winner the center of attention for the day and inspiring the rest to try harder, often only for a brief time. While Tom may never have really wanted the Bible itself, he certainly craved the recognition and prestige that came with earning one."

          "text_segment": "In due course the superintendent stood up in front of the pulpit, with a closed hymn-book in his hand and his forefinger inserted between its leaves, and commanded attention. When a Sunday-school superintendent makes his customary little speech, a hymn-book in the hand is as necessary as is the inevitable sheet of music in the hand of a singer who stands forward on the platform and sings a solo at a concert—though why, is a mystery: for neither the hymn-book nor the sheet of music is ever referred to by the sufferer. This superintendent was a slim creature of thirty-five, with a sandy goatee and short sandy hair; he wore a stiff standing-collar whose upper edge almost reached his ears and whose sharp points curved forward abreast the corners of his mouth—a fence that compelled a straight lookout ahead, and a turning of the whole body when a side view was required; his chin was propped on a spreading cravat which was as broad and as long as a bank-note, and had fringed ends; his boot toes were turned sharply up, in the fashion of the day, like sleigh-runners—an effect patiently and laboriously produced by the young men by sitting with their toes pressed against a wall for hours together. Mr. Walters was very earnest of mien, and very sincere and honest at heart; and he held sacred things and places in such reverence, and so separated them from worldly matters, that unconsciously to himself his Sunday-school voice had acquired a peculiar intonation which was wholly absent on week-days. He began after this fashion:\n“Now, children, I want you all to sit up just as straight and pretty as you can and give me all your attention for a minute or two. There—that is it. That is the way good little boys and girls should do. I see one little girl who is looking out of the window—I am afraid she thinks I am out there somewhere—perhaps up in one of the trees making a speech to the little birds. [Applausive titter.] I want to tell you how good it makes me feel to see so many bright, clean little faces assembled in a place like this, learning to do right and be good.” And so forth and so on. It is not necessary to set down the rest of the oration. It was of a pattern which does not vary, and so it is familiar to us all.\nThe latter third of the speech was marred by the resumption of fights and other recreations among certain of the bad boys, and by fidgetings and whisperings that extended far and wide, washing even to the bases of isolated and incorruptible rocks like Sid and Mary. But now every sound ceased suddenly, with the subsidence of Mr. Walters’ voice, and the conclusion of the speech was received with a burst of silent gratitude.\nA good part of the whispering had been occasioned by an event which was more or less rare—the entrance of visitors: lawyer Thatcher, accompanied by a very feeble and aged man; a fine, portly, middle-aged gentleman with iron-gray hair; and a dignified lady who was doubtless the latter’s wife. The lady was leading a child. Tom had been restless and full of chafings and repinings; conscience-smitten, too—he could not meet Amy Lawrence’s eye, he could not brook her loving gaze. But when he saw this small newcomer his soul was all ablaze with bliss in a moment. The next moment he was “showing off” with all his might—cuffing boys, pulling hair, making faces—in a word, using every art that seemed likely to fascinate a girl and win her applause. His exaltation had but one alloy—the memory of his humiliation in this angel’s garden—and that record in sand was fast washing out, under the waves of happiness that were sweeping over it now.",
          "paraphrase_gemini-2.5-flash-preview-04-17": "Eventually, the superintendent stood before the pulpit, holding a closed hymn-book with a finger marking a page, and called for quiet. When a Sunday-school superintendent gives his usual brief talk, having a hymn-book in hand is as essential as a singer on stage holding a sheet of music during a solo performance—though the reason is unclear, as neither is ever consulted by the person speaking or singing. This superintendent was a slender man of thirty-five, with a reddish goatee and short reddish hair. He wore a stiff, high collar that nearly reached his ears, its sharp points curving forward by his mouth, effectively forcing him to look straight ahead and turn his entire body to see sideways. His chin rested on a wide, long, fringed necktie, comparable in size to a bank-note. His boot toes were fashionably curled sharply upward, resembling sleigh runners—a look young men achieved patiently by pressing their toes against a wall for extended periods. Mr. Walters had a very serious look but was genuinely sincere and honest at heart. He regarded sacred things and places with such deep respect, keeping them separate from everyday matters, that without realizing it, his voice for Sunday school had developed a distinct tone absent during the week. He started his address by saying, “Now, children, I’d like you all to sit up as straight and nicely as possible and give me your full attention for just a moment or two. That’s it—very good. That’s how good little boys and girls should behave. I notice one little girl looking out the window—I wonder if she thinks I’m out there somewhere—perhaps up in a tree giving a speech to the birds. [Laughter.] It truly warms my heart to see so many cheerful, clean young faces gathered in a place like this, learning to do what is right and be good.” His speech continued in this vein. The rest of his talk isn’t worth recording. It followed a predictable structure that never changed, making it familiar to everyone. The final third of the speech was disrupted by certain unruly boys resuming their fights and other activities, and by widespread fidgeting and whispering. These disturbances even reached the seemingly unshakeable figures like Sid and Mary. However, as Mr. Walters’ voice subsided and the speech concluded, all sound abruptly ceased, and the ending was met with a collective, silent sense of relief. Much of the whispering had been caused by a somewhat unusual occurrence—the arrival of visitors: lawyer Thatcher, accompanied by a very frail elderly gentleman; a dignified, plump, middle-aged man with graying hair; and a distinguished lady who was likely the latter’s wife. The lady was leading a child. Tom had been restless, feeling irritated and regretful, and also plagued by guilt—he couldn’t meet Amy Lawrence’s gaze and found her loving look unbearable. But upon seeing this young newcomer, his spirit instantly ignited with joy. The next moment, he was demonstrating his utmost efforts to impress—hitting boys, pulling hair, making faces—in short, employing every tactic he thought might captivate a girl and earn her admiration. His elevated spirits were only slightly tempered by the memory of his humiliation in this angelic girl’s yard—but that painful recollection, like words written in sand, was rapidly being erased by the waves of happiness washing over him now.",

It’s typical for a superintendent to hold a hymn-book during his brief speech at Sunday-school, just like a singer often has a sheet of music at a concert, even though neither ever actually uses them—which is rather puzzling. The superintendent, a slender man of thirty-five with sandy-colored hair and goatee, wore a stiff collar that pressed high up his neck and required him to turn his whole body to look to the side. His chin rested on a broad cravat with fringed ends, and his pointed boots curled up sharply at the toes, a style young men of the time achieved by pressing their toes against a wall for hours. Mr. Walters looked very earnest and was truly sincere and reverent, so much so that, without realizing, he used a special Sunday-school voice different from his weekday voice. He began his remarks by encouraging the children to sit up straight and pay full attention, gently teasing a girl for looking out the window, and expressing delight at seeing their bright, clean faces gathered to learn goodness and virtue. The rest of his speech, which followed the usual routine, does not need repeating here. Unfortunately, the last part was disrupted by misbehaving boys and growing whispers, which eventually even distracted the most well-behaved children like Sid and Mary. But as soon as Mr. Walters finished, everything went quiet, and the children were thankful for the end of the speech. Much of the whispering had started because some visitors had come in—lawyer Thatcher, a very old man, a classy middle-aged gentleman with gray hair, and an elegant lady who was probably his wife, leading a child. Tom, who had been uneasy and guilty (avoiding Amy Lawrence’s gaze), was instantly overjoyed when he spotted the new child. Excited, he began to show off by playfully hitting boys, pulling hair, and making faces—trying every trick to impress her. The only thing that dulled his happiness was remembering his earlier embarrassment in ‘this angel’s garden,’ but even that memory was fading quickly as he was swept away by joy."

          "text_segment": "The visitors were given the highest seat of honor, and as soon as Mr. Walters’ speech was finished, he introduced them to the school. The middle-aged man turned out to be a prodigious personage—no less a one than the county judge—altogether the most august creation these children had ever looked upon—and they wondered what kind of material he was made of—and they half wanted to hear him roar, and were half afraid he might, too. He was from Constantinople, twelve miles away—so he had travelled, and seen the world—these very eyes had looked upon the county court-house—which was said to have a tin roof. The awe which these reflections inspired was attested by the impressive silence and the ranks of staring eyes. This was the great Judge Thatcher, brother of their own lawyer. Jeff Thatcher immediately went forward, to be familiar with the great man and be envied by the school. It would have been music to his soul to hear the whisperings:\n“Look at him, Jim! He’s a going up there. Say—look! he’s a going to shake hands with him—he is shaking hands with him! By jings, don’t you wish you was Jeff?”\nMr. Walters fell to “showing off,” with all sorts of official bustlings and activities, giving orders, delivering judgments, discharging directions here, there, everywhere that he could find a target. The librarian “showed off”—running hither and thither with his arms full of books and making a deal of the splutter and fuss that insect authority delights in. The young lady teachers “showed off”—bending sweetly over pupils that were lately being boxed, lifting pretty warning fingers at bad little boys and patting good ones lovingly. The young gentlemen teachers “showed off” with small scoldings and other little displays of authority and fine attention to discipline—and most of the teachers, of both sexes, found business up at the library, by the pulpit; and it was business that frequently had to be done over again two or three times (with much seeming vexation). The little girls “showed off” in various ways, and the little boys “showed off” with such diligence that the air was thick with paper wads and the murmur of scufflings. And above it all the great man sat and beamed a majestic judicial smile upon all the house, and warmed himself in the sun of his own grandeur—for he was “showing off,” too.",
          "paraphrase_gemini-2.5-flash-preview-04-17": "The visitors were given the most distinguished seating, and immediately after Mr. Walters concluded his speech, he introduced them to the assembled school. The gentleman in middle age turned out to be a remarkably important figure—no less than the county judge—the most impressive human being these children had ever beheld. They speculated about what sort of substance he was made of, feeling both a partial desire to hear him bellow and a partial apprehension that he might. He was from Constantinople, just twelve miles away—indicating he had journeyed and experienced the world—these very eyes had gazed upon the county courthouse, which was rumored to possess a tin roof. The deep sense of awe inspired by these thoughts was confirmed by the profound silence and the rows of fixed gazes. This was the renowned Judge Thatcher, brother to their local lawyer. Jeff Thatcher promptly advanced, aiming to appear familiar with the important man and earn the envy of the entire school. It would have been delightful for him to overhear the hushed comments: \"Look at him, Jim! He's walking towards him. Wow—look! He's about to shake hands with him—he *is* shaking hands with him! Goodness, don't you wish you were Jeff?\" Mr. Walters then began his own performance, engaging in all sorts of official flurry and activity, issuing directives, rendering decisions, and dispensing instructions everywhere he could find someone to address. The librarian also put on a display—hurrying back and forth with stacks of books and creating the significant bustling and commotion that minor authority figures relish. The young women teachers also performed—leaning kindly over students who had recently received corporal punishment, delicately raising their fingers in warning at naughty boys, and affectionately stroking the heads of good ones. The young men teachers likewise performed with minor rebukes and other small demonstrations of power and diligent attention to discipline. Most teachers, regardless of gender, found tasks that needed doing near the library, by the pulpit; these tasks frequently required repeating two or three times, seemingly with considerable annoyance. The young girls performed in various ways, and the young boys performed with such enthusiasm that the air was thick with thrown paper wads and the low noise of minor scuffles. And above it all, the distinguished man sat, radiating a grand, magisterial smile upon the whole room, basking in the warmth of his own importance—for he, too, was performing.",
          "paraphrase_gpt-4.1-2025-04-14": "The visitors were given the most honored place, and after Mr. Walters finished speaking, he presented them to the students. The middle-aged man turned out to be incredibly important—he was actually the county judge, the most impressive person the children had ever seen. They marvelled at his presence, wondering what he was made of, half-expecting him to roar, and a little frightened that he just might. He came from Constantinople, a town twelve miles away, so he was considered well-traveled and worldly—his own eyes had seen the county courthouse, which people said had a tin roof. The awe these thoughts caused was clear in the way everyone sat silently, staring wide-eyed. This notable figure was Judge Thatcher, the brother of their town’s lawyer. Jeff Thatcher rushed up to greet him, wanting to be close to such greatness and to make the other students jealous. He would have relished hearing them whispering: “Look, Jim! He’s going up there. Wow—he’s going to shake his hand—he is shaking his hand! Man, don’t you wish you were Jeff?”\nMr. Walters began to show off, bustling about with authority, handing out orders, making judgments, giving instructions wherever possible. The librarian also tried to impress, hurrying around with arms full of books and making a lot of commotion in the way that people with minor authority often do. The young female teachers put on a display too—now kindly leaning over students they had just disciplined, raising gentle fingers at misbehaving boys and affectionately patting well-behaved ones. The young male teachers highlighted their authority with small reprimands and disciplined attention, and many teachers, both men and women, found reasons to go to the library near the pulpit, often repeating the same tasks several times while pretending irritation. The little girls tried to show off in their own ways, while the little boys showed off so much that the air was filled with thrown paper and the sounds of playful shoving. Over all this activity, the great judge sat with a dignified, satisfied smile, basking in his own importance—he too was showing off."

Several pupils had a few yellow tickets, but none had enough—he had been around among the star pupils inquiring. He would have given worlds, now, to have that German lad back again with a sound mind.\nAnd now at this moment, when hope was dead, Tom Sawyer came forward with nine yellow tickets, nine red tickets, and ten blue ones, and demanded a Bible. This was a thunderbolt out of a clear sky. Walters was not expecting an application from this source for the next ten years. But there was no getting around it—here were the certified checks, and they were good for their face. Tom was therefore elevated to a place with the Judge and the other elect, and the great news was announced from headquarters. It was the most stunning surprise of the decade, and so profound was the sensation that it lifted the new hero up to the judicial one’s altitude, and the school had two marvels to gaze upon in place of one. The boys were all eaten up with envy—but those that suffered the bitterest pangs were those who perceived too late that they themselves had contributed to this hated splendor by trading tickets to Tom for the wealth he had amassed in selling whitewashing privileges. These despised themselves, as being the dupes of a wily fraud, a guileful snake in the grass.\nThe prize was delivered to Tom with as much effusion as the superintendent could pump up under the circumstances; but it lacked somewhat of the true gush, for the poor fellow’s instinct taught him that there was a mystery here that could not well bear the light, perhaps; it was simply preposterous that this boy had warehoused two thousand sheaves of Scriptural wisdom on his premises—a dozen would strain his capacity, without a doubt.\nAmy Lawrence was proud and glad, and she tried to make Tom see it in her face—but he wouldn’t look. She wondered; then she was just a grain troubled; next a dim suspicion came and went—came again; she watched; a furtive glance told her worlds—and then her heart broke, and she was jealous, and angry, and the tears came and she hated everybody. Tom most of all (she thought).",

Several students possessed a few yellow tickets, but none had accumulated enough—he had consulted with the top performers. He would have given anything at that moment to have the German boy back with a clear mind. Then, just as hope had vanished, Tom Sawyer stepped forward with nine yellow, nine red, and ten blue tickets and requested a Bible. This was a completely unexpected shock. Walters had not anticipated a request from Tom's direction for at least the next ten years. But there was no way around it; these were verifiable tickets, and they were redeemable for their stated value. Consequently, Tom was elevated to a position of honor alongside the Judge and the other distinguished individuals, and the significant news was announced from the podium. It was the most astonishing surprise of the decade, and the impact was so profound that it raised the new hero to the same level of regard as the judicial figure, leaving the school with two wonders to behold instead of just one. All the boys were overcome with envy. However, the most intense suffering was felt by those who recognized too late that they themselves had contributed to this detested achievement by trading tickets to Tom for the wealth he had acquired selling chances to whitewash. They felt contempt for themselves, feeling like simpletons fooled by a cunning cheat, a treacherous person in disguise. The prize was presented to Tom with as much outward warmth as the superintendent could generate under the circumstances; but it lacked some true sincerity, as the poor man's intuition suggested there was likely a mystery here that couldn't withstand scrutiny, perhaps; it seemed utterly ridiculous that this boy had genuinely stored two thousand passages of scriptural knowledge—a dozen would surely exceed his capacity. Amy Lawrence felt proud and happy and attempted to show this to Tom with her expression—but he wouldn't look at her. She was puzzled; then she felt a little troubled; next, a faint suspicion came and went—then returned; she watched him; a quick, secretive glance from him confirmed everything—and then her heart broke, and she was jealous, and angry, and tears came and she hated everyone.

The shock of Tom’s feat was so great that the school now had two wonders to admire instead of one.

These boys felt foolish and deceived by Tom’s cunning. The prize was presented to Tom with as much enthusiasm as the superintendent could muster, but he secretly sensed something was amiss—after all, it seemed absurd to believe Tom had memorized so many Bible verses. Amy Lawrence was happy and proud of Tom and tried to show it, but he avoided her gaze. She became uneasy, suspicion flickered in her mind, and as she watched Tom closely, realization dawned.

And you never can be sorry for the trouble you took to learn them; for knowledge is worth more than anything there is in the world; it’s what makes great men and good men; you’ll be a great man and a good man yourself, some day, Thomas, and then you’ll look back and say, It’s all owing to the precious Sunday-school privileges of my boyhood—it’s all owing to my dear teachers that taught me to learn—it’s all owing to the good superintendent, who encouraged me, and watched over me, and gave me a beautiful Bible—a splendid elegant Bible—to keep and have it all for my own, always—it’s all owing to right bringing up! That is what you will say, Thomas—and you wouldn’t take any money for those two thousand verses—no indeed you wouldn’t. And now you wouldn’t mind telling me and this lady some of the things you’ve learned—no, I know you wouldn’t—for we are proud of little boys that learn.

Secretly, Tom felt so intimidated and reverent that he wished he could fall to the ground and worship the Judge, especially if it were dark and no one could see him. The Judge placed his hand on Tom's head, complimented him as a 'fine little man,' and inquired about his name. The boy responded haltingly, struggling to speak, finally managing to say, \"Tom.\" The Judge corrected, \"Oh, not just Tom—it must be—\" prompting Tom to say, \"Thomas.\" \"Ah, yes,\" the Judge said, \"that's right.

But I assume you have a last name as well, and I expect you'll share it with me, won't you?\" Mr. Walters interjected, \"Tell the gentleman your surname, Thomas,\" and added, \"and remember to add 'sir.' Don't forget your manners.\" Tom replied, \"Thomas Sawyer—sir.\" \"Exactly!\" the Judge exclaimed. \"That's a good child. Excellent boy. A fine, courageous little fellow. Learning two thousand Bible verses is a truly remarkable achievement—a very, very large number. And you will never regret the effort you put into memorizing them, because knowledge is the most valuable thing in the world; it's what shapes excellent and virtuous individuals. You yourself will grow up to be an excellent and virtuous person someday, Thomas, and when you do, you'll reflect and recognize that it was all thanks to the valuable opportunities provided by the Sunday school during your childhood—it's all because of my cherished teachers who taught me to study—it's all due to the commendable superintendent, who supported me, guided me, and presented me with a wonderful Bible—a magnificent, elegant Bible—to own and keep always; it's all the result of proper upbringing! That is precisely what you will say, Thomas, and you wouldn't accept any money in exchange for the knowledge gained from those two thousand verses—absolutely not. And now, I'm sure you wouldn't mind sharing with this lady and me some of what you've learned—no, I'm confident you wouldn't—because we admire young boys who study. Now, I'm certain you are familiar with the names of all the twelve disciples. Could you please tell us the names of the initial two who were chosen?\" Tom began fidgeting with a button on his clothes and appeared embarrassed. He flushed red and avoided eye contact.

Nevertheless, he felt he had to prompt Tom, saying, \"Respond to the gentleman, Thomas—don't be nervous.\" Tom remained silent, hesitating. \"I'm sure you'll tell me now,\" the lady said kindly, trying to help. \"The names of the first two disciples were—\" \"David and Goliath!\" Tom blurted out.

Tom nervously managed to say, \"Tom.\" The Judge asked for his full name, and with some prompting from Mr. Walters, Tom replied, \"Thomas Sawyer, sir.\" The Judge praised him, saying he was a good boy and mentioning that learning two thousand Bible verses was a significant achievement. He told Tom that gaining knowledge was very valuable and would help him become a great man, and that he would one day be grateful for the lessons and guidance he’d received at Sunday school. The Judge then asked Tom to show what he had learned by naming the first two disciples chosen by Jesus. Tom, embarrassed and unsure, couldn't answer right away.

The choir always tittered and whispered all through service. There was once a church choir that was not ill-bred, but I have forgotten where it was, now. It was a great many years ago, and I can scarcely remember anything about it, but I think it was in some foreign country.\nThe minister gave out the hymn, and read it through with a relish, in a peculiar style which was much admired in that part of the country. His voice began on a medium key and climbed steadily up till it reached a certain point, where it bore with strong emphasis upon the topmost word and then plunged down as if from a spring-board:\nShall I be car-ri-ed toe the skies, on flow’ry beds\nof ease,\nWhilst others fight to win the prize, and sail thro’ blood\n-y seas?\nHe was regarded as a wonderful reader. At church “sociables” he was always called upon to read poetry; and when he was through, the ladies would lift up their hands and let them fall helplessly in their laps, and “wall” their eyes, and shake their heads, as much as to say, “Words cannot express it; it is too beautiful, TOO beautiful for this mortal earth.”\nAfter the hymn had been sung, the Rev. Mr. Sprague turned himself into a bulletin-board, and read off “notices” of meetings and societies and things till it seemed that the list would stretch out to the crack of doom—a queer custom which is still kept up in America, even in cities, away here in this age of abundant newspapers.

The choir members consistently giggled and whispered throughout the entire service. The narrator recalled only one instance of a well-behaved church choir, but couldn't remember where it was located, believing it was likely in a foreign country many years ago and barely recalling any specifics about it.\nThe minister then announced the hymn, reading it aloud with noticeable enjoyment and in a distinct style highly regarded in that region. His reading began at a moderate pitch, steadily rising to a high point where he strongly emphasized the last word, then abruptly descended as if leaping from a platform. This peculiar delivery was illustrated by his reading of the lines: 'Shall I be car-ri-ed toe the skies, on flow’ry beds of ease, Whilst others fight to win the prize, and sail thro’ blood-y seas?' He was widely considered an outstanding reader. At church social events, he was always asked to read poetry; and afterwards, the women would dramatically gesture their admiration, letting their hands drop into their laps, rolling their eyes, and shaking their heads as if to say, 'It's beyond words; it's too exquisite, truly TOO beautiful for this mortal world.'\nAfter the hymn concluded, Reverend Sprague transformed into a living announcement board, reading out notices for gatherings, organizations, and various other items until the list appeared to stretch on indefinitely. The narrator noted this as a peculiar tradition that continues in America, even in major cities today, despite the ready availability of newspapers. He concluded that traditional customs are often harder to eliminate the less practical justification they have.",

I once heard of a church choir that behaved perfectly, but I can’t recall where that was—it was many years ago, probably in some foreign land. The minister announced the hymn and read it with enthusiasm, in a distinct local style. His voice would start in the middle range, gradually rise, then emphasize the highest word before dropping suddenly, almost dramatically: 'Shall I be carried to the skies on flowery beds of ease, whilst others fight to win the prize, and sail through bloody seas?' People thought he was a remarkable reader, and at church gatherings he was always asked to recite poetry. When he finished, the ladies would gesture and sigh as if overcome by his talent, implying it was simply too lovely for words, too beautiful for the world. After the hymn, Reverend Sprague began reading out all the announcements about meetings and societies, making the list seem endless—a strange tradition that persists in America, even nowadays with so many newspapers. It often seems that the less important a custom is, the harder it is to abandon."

Amen.\nThere was a rustling of dresses, and the standing congregation sat down. The boy whose history this book relates did not enjoy the prayer, he only endured it—if he even did that much. He was restive all through it; he kept tally of the details of the prayer, unconsciously—for he was not listening, but he knew the ground of old, and the clergyman’s regular route over it—and when a little trifle of new matter was interlarded, his ear detected it and his whole nature resented it; he considered additions unfair, and scoundrelly. In the midst of the prayer a fly had lit on the back of the pew in front of him and tortured his spirit by calmly rubbing its hands together, embracing its head with its arms, and polishing it so vigorously that it seemed to almost part company with the body, and the slender thread of a neck was exposed to view; scraping its wings with its hind legs and smoothing them to its body as if they had been coat-tails; going through its whole toilet as tranquilly as if it knew it was perfectly safe. As indeed it was; for as sorely as Tom’s hands itched to grab for it they did not dare—he believed his soul would be instantly destroyed if he did such a thing while the prayer was going on. But with the closing sentence his hand began to curve and steal forward; and the instant the “Amen” was out the fly was a prisoner of war. His aunt detected the act and made him let it go.",
          "paraphrase_gemini-2.5-flash-preview-04-17": "Following this, the minister delivered his prayer. It was quite comprehensive and detailed, offering petitions for the church, its young members, the village's other congregations, the village itself, the surrounding county and state, government officials at the state level, the United States, its churches, Congress, the President, other federal government employees, sailors struggling in turbulent seas, oppressed people suffering under European monarchies and Asian dictatorships, those who have access to religious knowledge but fail to understand it, and non-believers in distant lands. He concluded with a plea that his upcoming sermon would be well-received and impactful, like seeds planted in fertile soil that would eventually produce a positive outcome. With a collective rustle, the congregation, who had been standing, took their seats. The young protagonist of this story did not find joy in the prayer but merely endured it, or perhaps not even fully that. He was restless throughout the entire duration. Without consciously listening, he still kept track of the prayer's structure, being familiar with the minister's usual pattern. If a small new detail was introduced, he noticed it immediately and felt annoyed, deeming such additions unfair and underhanded. During the prayer, a fly landed on the bench in front of him and tormented him by calmly grooming itself: it rubbed its forelegs together, seemed to hug its head with its limbs, polished its head so vigorously it looked like it might separate from its body, revealing a thin neck; it also scraped and smoothed its wings against its body as if tidying a coat. The fly performed its entire routine as calmly as if it knew it was completely safe, which it was. Although Tom desperately wanted to catch it, he didn't dare, believing such an action during the prayer would lead to his immediate damnation. However, as the prayer's final words were spoken, his hand began to curl and creep forward. The moment 'Amen' was uttered, the fly became his captive. His aunt observed this and made him release it.",
          "paraphrase_gpt-4.1-2025-04-14": "At this point, the minister began to pray. It was a thorough and heartfelt prayer, covering a wide array of subjects: he petitioned on behalf of the church and its children, as well as the other churches in the village. His prayers extended to the village itself, the county, the State, its officials, the United States, all its churches, Congress, the President, and government officers. He also prayed for sailors enduring rough seas, for the oppressed masses under European and Eastern rulers, for those who have heard the message but do not understand it, and for those in distant lands who haven't been exposed to the faith. The prayer concluded with a request that his words would be well-received and fruitful. Afterward, the congregation sat down as the quiet resumed. However, the main character of the story, Tom, didn’t enjoy the prayer; he merely sat through it, if that. Tom grew impatient and, although he wasn’t truly listening, could mentally keep track of the prayer’s progress, recognizing the usual routine. Any slight deviation caught his attention and annoyed him, making him think the preacher was being unfair by adding new parts. During the prayer, a fly landed on the pew in front of Tom and distracted him by grooming itself in various ways. Tom desperately wanted to catch it, but he feared dire consequences if he acted during the prayer. As soon as the minister finished with 'Amen,' Tom quickly trapped the fly, but his aunt noticed and forced him to set it free."

Tom usually spent the sermon counting its pages; he always knew the length afterward but rarely any of its substance. However, for a short time on this occasion, he was genuinely interested. The minister painted a powerful and touching image of humanity gathering at the millennium, when predators and prey, like the lion and the lamb, would live together peacefully, led by a young child. But the emotional depth, the lesson, and the moral point of this magnificent scene were lost on Tom. He only fixated on how prominent the main character, the child, would be in front of all the watching world.

This time, though, Tom was momentarily intrigued when the minister vividly described the gathering of all people at the millennium, a time when the lion and lamb would rest together and a little child would lead them. Yet, Tom missed the emotional significance and moral message of the scene; he was only impressed by the idea of being the child at the center of everyone’s attention. The thought lit up his face, and he mused that he would like to be that child—as long as the lion was tame."

It was a large black beetle with formidable jaws—a “pinchbug,” he called it. It was in a percussion-cap box. The first thing the beetle did was to take him by the finger. A natural fillip followed, the beetle went floundering into the aisle and lit on its back, and the hurt finger went into the boy’s mouth. The beetle lay there working its helpless legs, unable to turn over. Tom eyed it, and longed for it; but it was safe out of his reach. Other people uninterested in the sermon found relief in the beetle, and they eyed it too. Presently a vagrant poodle dog came idling along, sad at heart, lazy with the summer softness and the quiet, weary of captivity, sighing for change. He spied the beetle; the drooping tail lifted and wagged. He surveyed the prize; walked around it; smelt at it from a safe distance; walked around it again; grew bolder, and took a closer smell; then lifted his lip and made a gingerly snatch at it, just missing it; made another, and another; began to enjoy the diversion; subsided to his stomach with the beetle between his paws, and continued his experiments; grew weary at last, and then indifferent and absent-minded. His head nodded, and little by little his chin descended and touched the enemy, who seized it. There was a sharp yelp, a flirt of the poodle’s head, and the beetle fell a couple of yards away, and lit on its back once more. The neighboring spectators shook with a gentle inward joy, several faces went behind fans and hand-kerchiefs, and Tom was entirely happy. The dog looked foolish, and probably felt so; but there was resentment in his heart, too, and a craving for revenge. So he went to the beetle and began a wary attack on it again; jumping at it from every point of a circle, lighting with his fore-paws within an inch of the creature, making even closer snatches at it with his teeth, and jerking his head till his ears flapped again. But he grew tired once more, after a while; tried to amuse himself with a fly but found no relief; followed an ant around, with his nose close to the floor, and quickly wearied of that; yawned, sighed, forgot the beetle entirely, and sat down on it. Then there was a wild yelp of agony and the poodle went sailing up the aisle; the yelps continued, and so did the dog; he crossed the house in front of the altar; he flew down the other aisle; he crossed before the doors; he clamored up the home-stretch; his anguish grew with his progress, till presently he was but a woolly comet moving in its orbit with the gleam and the speed of light. At last the frantic sufferer sheered from its course, and sprang into its master’s lap; he flung it out of the window, and the voice of distress quickly thinned away and died in the distance.",

Reacting naturally, Tom flicked it, sending the beetle tumbling into the aisle where it landed on its back, while his injured finger went into his mouth. The beetle lay there, struggling its legs uselessly, unable to flip itself over. Tom watched it, wishing he could get it, but it was too far away. Other people, also finding the sermon uninteresting, were similarly captivated by the beetle and watched it. Soon, a stray poodle wandered by, looking sad and weary, lazy from the warm summer air and the quiet, longing for something different from his confinement. He noticed the beetle; his drooping tail lifted and began to wag. He examined the potential prize, circled it, sniffed cautiously from a distance, circled again, growing braver, and took a closer sniff. He then lifted his lip and attempted a delicate snap at it, missing slightly. He tried again and again, starting to find amusement in the interaction. He lay down on his stomach with the beetle between his paws and continued his attempts. Eventually, he grew tired, becoming indifferent and inattentive. His head began to droop, and slowly his chin lowered and touched the beetle, which immediately clamped onto it. With a sharp yelp and a quick flick of his head, the poodle sent the beetle flying a few feet away, landing on its back once more. Those nearby who witnessed the event shook with quiet amusement, and several people hid their smiles behind fans and handkerchiefs. Tom was completely delighted. The dog looked embarrassed and probably felt it, but he also felt resentment and a desire for retaliation. So, he returned to the beetle and resumed a careful assault, leaping at it from different angles around a circle, landing his front paws within an inch of the creature, making even closer snaps with his teeth and shaking his head vigorously, causing his ears to flap. However, after a while, he grew weary again. He tried to entertain himself with a fly but found no relief. He followed an ant with his nose near the floor, but quickly tired of that too. He yawned, sighed, forgot all about the beetle, and sat down directly on it. This prompted a loud yelp of pain, and the poodle shot down the aisle. The yelping continued, as did the dog's frantic race. He sped across the front of the church near the altar, flew down the opposite aisle, crossed in front of the doors, and then sprinted up the aisle towards the back. His suffering intensified with his speed, until he seemed like nothing more than a fuzzy blur moving with incredible speed. Finally, the distressed dog veered off course and leaped into his master's lap, who promptly threw it out the window. The sounds of distress quickly faded and died away in the distance.",
          "paraphrase_gpt-4.1-2025-04-14": "Once again, Tom sank into discomfort as the dull sermon continued. Soon, he remembered he had a treasure with him and took it out. It was a big black beetle with strong jaws, which he called a \"pinchbug.\" He kept it in a percussion-cap box. As soon as Tom took the beetle out, it pinched his finger. Instinctively, he flicked the beetle away, sending it tumbling into the aisle where it landed on its back, legs flailing. Tom sucked his injured finger and watched the beetle longingly, but it was now too far away to reach. Other bored churchgoers also noticed the beetle and began watching it. After a while, a stray poodle wandered in, looking bored and tired of being cooped up. The dog soon noticed the beetle, perked up, and began cautiously circling and sniffing around it. He tried to snap the beetle up several times, gaining confidence with each attempt. Eventually, the poodle lay down with the beetle between his paws, still trying to mess with it, but soon lost interest. The dog’s head drooped and, as his chin touched the beetle, it bit him. The dog yelped and flung his head, tossing the beetle a few yards away onto its back again. Some of the people watching tried to hide their laughter, and Tom was delighted. The poodle, embarrassed but annoyed, attacked the beetle again, circling it and trying to catch it with his paws and teeth, but soon became bored and tried to entertain himself with a fly and then an ant, but found neither amusing. Finally, forgetting about the beetle, the dog sat down right on top of it, causing another loud yelp as the beetle bit him again. The poodle bolted down the church aisle, yelping in pain, ran all around the church, and finally leapt into his master’s lap. The owner threw him out the window, and the sounds of the dog’s distress faded away in the distance."

Presently it occurred to him that he wished he was sick; then he could stay home from school. Here was a vague possibility. He canvassed his system. No ailment was found, and he investigated again. This time he thought he could detect colicky symptoms, and he began to encourage them with considerable hope. But they soon grew feeble, and presently died wholly away. He reflected further. Suddenly he discovered something. One of his upper front teeth was loose. This was lucky; he was about to begin to groan, as a “starter,” as he called it, when it occurred to him that if he came into court with that argument, his aunt would pull it out, and that would hurt. So he thought he would hold the tooth in reserve for the present, and seek further. Nothing offered for some little time, and then he remembered hearing the doctor tell about a certain thing that laid up a patient for two or three weeks and threatened to make him lose a finger.

Tom lay there thinking. Soon, the idea struck him that he wished he were ill; that way, he could stay home instead of going to school. This seemed like a slight possibility. He checked himself over for symptoms. Finding no sickness, he looked again. This time, he thought he detected signs of a stomach ache, and he tried hard to encourage them with some hope. However, these feelings quickly weakened and soon vanished completely. He kept thinking. Suddenly, he found something. One of his upper front teeth was wobbly. This seemed promising; he was just about to start moaning, as a 'warm-up' he called it, when he realized that if he used that excuse, his aunt would probably pull the tooth out, which would be painful. So, he decided to keep the tooth idea in reserve for the moment and search further. For a little while, nothing came to mind, and then he remembered hearing the doctor mention an illness that kept a patient bedridden for several weeks and posed a risk of losing a finger. The boy eagerly pulled his aching toe out from under the blanket and examined it. But now, he didn't know what the symptoms of that particular illness were.

He wished he were sick, since then he could miss school. This idea gave him a sliver of hope. He checked for any signs of illness, but found none, so he tried again. This time, he convinced himself he might have a stomachache and tried to encourage the feeling in hopes it would get worse, but the symptoms faded quickly and disappeared. He thought some more and then remembered one of his upper front teeth was loose. He considered pretending to be in pain because of it, but realized that if he complained, his aunt would probably pull it out, which would hurt.

Tom, I love you, but you always find new ways to test my patience.\"\nBy now, everything was ready.

The tooth popped out and was left hanging by the thread."

As Tom wended to school after breakfast, he was the envy of every boy he met because the gap in his upper row of teeth enabled him to expectorate in a new and admirable way. He gathered quite a following of lads interested in the exhibition; and one that had cut his finger and had been a centre of fascination and homage up to this time, now found himself suddenly without an adherent, and shorn of his glory. His heart was heavy, and he said with a disdain which he did not feel that it wasn’t anything to spit like Tom Sawyer; but another boy said, “Sour grapes!” and he wandered away a dismantled hero.\nShortly Tom came upon the juvenile pariah of the village, Huckleberry Finn, son of the town drunkard. Huckleberry was cordially hated and dreaded by all the mothers of the town, because he was idle and lawless and vulgar and bad—and because all their children admired him so, and delighted in his forbidden society, and wished they dared to be like him. Tom was like the rest of the respectable boys, in that he envied Huckleberry his gaudy outcast condition, and was under strict orders not to play with him. So he played with him every time he got a chance. Huckleberry was always dressed in the cast-off clothes of full-grown men, and they were in perennial bloom and fluttering with rags. His hat was a vast ruin with a wide crescent lopped out of its brim; his coat, when he wore one, hung nearly to his heels and had the rearward buttons far down the back; but one suspender supported his trousers; the seat of the trousers bagged low and contained nothing, the fringed legs dragged in the dirt when not rolled up.\nHuckleberry came and went, at his own free will. He slept on doorsteps in fine weather and in empty hogsheads in wet; he did not have to go to school or to church, or call any being master or obey anybody; he could go fishing or swimming when and where he chose, and stay as long as it suited him; nobody forbade him to fight; he could sit up as late as he pleased; he was always the first boy that went barefoot in the spring and the last to resume leather in the fall; he never had to wash, nor put on clean clothes; he could swear wonderfully. In a word, everything that goes to make life precious that boy had. So thought every harassed, hampered, respectable boy in St. Petersburg.",
          "paraphrase_gemini-2.5-flash-preview-04-17": "However, every challenge brings benefits. As Tom headed to school after eating, he was the object of admiration from every boy he encountered. This was thanks to a gap in his upper teeth, which allowed him to spit in a new and impressive way. He soon gathered a group of boys keen to see this demonstration. Another boy, who had been the focus of attention and respect because of a cut finger, suddenly found himself alone and stripped of his fame. Feeling discouraged, he declared with false contempt that spitting like Tom Sawyer was insignificant, but another boy dismissed his comment as \"Sour grapes,\" and he wandered off, his status as a hero lost. Later, Tom met the village's young outcast, Huckleberry Finn, the child of the town's drunkard. Mothers throughout the town intensely disliked and feared Huckleberry because he was lazy, defiant, rude, and generally bad. Paradoxically, their children greatly admired him, loved spending time with him despite it being forbidden, and secretly wished they had the nerve to be like him. Tom, like the other well-behaved boys, felt envious of Huckleberry's colorful, unsupervised life and was strictly forbidden from playing with him. Naturally, he played with him whenever he had an opportunity. Huckleberry's clothing always consisted of discarded adult garments that were perpetually ragged and fluttering. His hat was a damaged wreck missing a large section of its brim; his coat, if he wore one, hung nearly to his ankles with the back buttons positioned very low; only one suspender supported his pants; the seat of his trousers hung loosely and seemed empty, and the frayed bottoms dragged in the dirt unless they were rolled up. Huckleberry moved through life exactly as he wished. He slept on doorsteps in pleasant weather and in empty barrels when it rained. He was not required to attend school or church, acknowledge anyone as his master, or obey commands. He could go fishing or swimming whenever and wherever he pleased, staying as long as he liked. No one stopped him from fighting, and he could stay up late as he desired. He was always the first boy to go barefoot in the spring and the last to put on shoes in the fall. He never had to wash or put on clean clothes, and he was exceptionally good at swearing. In short, that boy possessed everything that made life seem valuable, or so thought every constrained, burdened, respectable boy in St. Petersburg.",
          "paraphrase_gpt-4.1-2025-04-14": "However, every hardship comes with its rewards. As Tom walked to school after breakfast, all the boys he met looked at him with envy, because the missing tooth in his upper row let him spit in a new and impressive way. He ended up with a group of fascinated boys following him for the display. A boy who had previously injured his finger and enjoyed being the center of attention suddenly found himself ignored and stripped of his status. He felt miserable and pretended to be unimpressed by Tom’s spitting, but another boy accused him of being jealous, so he drifted off, no longer the hero. Soon, Tom encountered Huckleberry Finn, the local outcast and son of the town drunk. All the mothers disapproved of Huckleberry for his laziness, bad behavior, and rough manners, especially since their children admired him and longed to befriend him. Tom, like other respectable boys, secretly wished he could be like Huck and was forbidden to associate with him—so, naturally, he played with him at every chance. Huckleberry always wore adult men’s discarded clothes, which were constantly ragged and flapping. His hat was battered with a large cut-out section in the brim; his coat, when he had one, nearly reached his heels and had buttons far down the back; only one suspender held up his trousers, which sagged and were empty, with frayed legs that dragged in the dirt unless rolled up. Huck lived as he pleased: he slept outside or in empty barrels, never had to go to school or church, didn’t answer to anyone, could fish and swim whenever and wherever he liked, was free to fight, stayed up as late as he wanted, was the first to go barefoot in spring and the last to wear shoes in autumn, didn’t have to wash or wear clean clothes, and was a remarkable swearer. In short, he had every freedom that made life appealing, or so thought every stressed, restricted, and well-behaved boy in St. Petersburg."

I wouldn’t give a dern for spunk-water.”\n“You wouldn’t, wouldn’t you? D’you ever try it?”\n“No, I hain’t. But Bob Tanner did.”\n“Who told you so!”\n“Why, he told Jeff Thatcher, and Jeff told Johnny Baker, and Johnny told Jim Hollis, and Jim told Ben Rogers, and Ben told a nigger, and the nigger told me. There now!”\n“Well, what of it? They’ll all lie. Leastways all but the nigger. I don’t know him. But I never see a nigger that wouldn’t lie. Shucks! Now you tell me how Bob Tanner done it, Huck.”\n“Why, he took and dipped his hand in a rotten stump where the rain-water was.”\n“In the daytime?”\n“Certainly.”\n“With his face to the stump?”\n“Yes. Least I reckon so.”\n“Did he say anything?”\n“I don’t reckon he did. I don’t know.”\n“Aha! Talk about trying to cure warts with spunk-water such a blame fool way as that! Why, that ain’t a-going to do any good. You got to go all by yourself, to the middle of the woods, where you know there’s a spunk-water stump, and just as it’s midnight you back up against the stump and jam your hand in and say:\n‘Barley-corn, barley-corn, injun-meal shorts,\nSpunk-water, spunk-water, swaller these warts,’\nand then walk away quick, eleven steps, with your eyes shut, and then turn around three times and walk home without speaking to anybody. Because if you speak the charm’s busted.”\n“Well, that sounds like a good way; but that ain’t the way Bob Tanner done.”\n“No, sir, you can bet he didn’t, becuz he’s the wartiest boy in this town; and he wouldn’t have a wart on him if he’d knowed how to work spunk-water. I’ve took off thousands of warts off of my hands that way, Huck. I play with frogs so much that I’ve always got considerable many warts. Sometimes I take ’em off with a bean.”\n“Yes, bean’s good. I’ve done that.”\n“Have you? What’s your way?”\n“You take and split the bean, and cut the wart so as to get some blood, and then you put the blood on one piece of the bean and take and dig a hole and bury it ’bout midnight at the crossroads in the dark of the moon, and then you burn up the rest of the bean. You see that piece that’s got the blood on it will keep drawing and drawing, trying to fetch the other piece to it, and so that helps the blood to draw the wart, and pretty soon off she comes.”\n“Yes, that’s it, Huck—that’s it; though when you’re burying it if you say ‘Down bean; off wart; come no more to bother me!’ it’s better. That’s the way Joe Harper does, and he’s been nearly to Coonville and most everywheres. But say—how do you cure ’em with dead cats?”\n“Why, you take your cat and go and get in the grave-yard ’long about midnight when somebody that was wicked has been buried; and when it’s midnight a devil will come, or maybe two or three, but you can’t see ’em, you can only hear something like the wind, or maybe hear ’em talk; and when they’re taking that feller away, you heave your cat after ’em and say, ‘Devil follow corpse, cat follow devil, warts follow cat, I’m done with ye!’ That’ll fetch any wart.”\n“Sounds right. D’you ever try it, Huck?”\n“No, but old Mother Hopkins told me.”\n“Well, I reckon it’s so, then. Becuz they say she’s a witch.”\n“Say! Why, Tom, I know she is. She witched pap. Pap says so his own self. He come along one day, and he see she was a-witching him, so he took up a rock, and if she hadn’t dodged, he’d a got her. Well, that very night he rolled off’n a shed wher’ he was a layin drunk, and broke his arm.”\n“Why, that’s awful. How did he know she was a-witching him?”\n“Lord, pap can tell, easy. Pap says when they keep looking at you right stiddy, they’re a-witching you. Specially if they mumble. Becuz when they mumble they’re saying the Lord’s Prayer backards.”\n“Say, Hucky, when you going to try the cat?”\n“To-night. I reckon they’ll come after old Hoss Williams to-night.”\n“But they buried him Saturday. Didn’t they get him Saturday night?”\n“Why, how you talk! How could their charms work till midnight?—and then it’s Sunday. Devils don’t slosh around much of a Sunday, I don’t reckon.”\n“I never thought of that. That’s so. Lemme go with you?”\n“Of course—if you ain’t afeard.”\n“Afeard! ’Tain’t likely. Will you meow?”\n“Yes—and you meow back, if you get a chance. Last time, you kep’ me a-meowing around till old Hays went to throwing rocks at me and says ‘Dern that cat!’ and so I hove a brick through his window—but don’t you tell.”\n“I won’t. I couldn’t meow that night, becuz auntie was watching me, but I’ll meow this time. Say—what’s that?”\n“Nothing but a tick.”\n“Where’d you get him?”\n“Out in the woods.”\n“What’ll you take for him?”\n“I don’t know. I don’t want to sell him.”\n“All right. It’s a mighty small tick, anyway.”\n“Oh, anybody can run a tick down that don’t belong to them. I’m satisfied with it. It’s a good enough tick for me.”\n“Sho, there’s ticks a plenty. I could have a thousand of ’em if I wanted to.”\n“Well, why don’t you? Becuz you know mighty well you can’t. This is a pretty early tick, I reckon. It’s the first one I’ve seen this year.”\n“Say, Huck—I’ll give you my tooth for him.”\n“Less see it.”\nTom got out a bit of paper and carefully unrolled it. Huckleberry viewed it wistfully. The temptation was very strong. At last he said:\n“Is it genuwyne?”\nTom lifted his lip and showed the vacancy.\n“Well, all right,” said Huckleberry, “it’s a trade.”\nTom enclosed the tick in the percussion-cap box that had lately been the pinchbug’s prison, and the boys separated, each feeling wealthier than before.",

'Where'd you get the blue ticket?' 'Bought it from Ben Rogers two weeks ago for a stick to roll hoops.' 'Say—what are dead cats good for, Huck?' 'Good for? Curing warts.' 'No! Really? I know something that works better.' 'I bet you don't. What is it?' 'Why, spunk-water.' 'Spunk-water! I wouldn't care at all for spunk-water.' 'Oh, you wouldn't, huh? Have you ever tried it?'

At least I think so.' 'Did he say anything?' 'I don't think he did. I don't know.' 'Aha! You call that trying to cure warts with spunk-water, such a stupid way! Why, that's not going to work at all. You have to go alone, deep into the woods, where you know there's a spunk-water stump, and exactly at midnight you back up against the stump and thrust your hand in and say: 'Barley-corn, barley-corn, Indian-meal shorts, Spunk-water, spunk-water, swallow these warts,' and then quickly walk away, eleven steps, with your eyes shut, and then turn around three times and walk home without talking to anyone. Because if you talk, the spell is broken.' 'Well, that sounds like a good way; but that's not how Bob Tanner did it.' 'No, sir, you can bet he didn't, because he's the boy with the most warts in this town; and he wouldn't have any warts left if he'd known how to use spunk-water properly. I've gotten rid of thousands of warts off my hands that way, Huck. I play with frogs so much that I always have quite a lot of warts. Sometimes I get rid of them with a bean.' 'Yes, a bean works well. I've done that.' 'Have you? What's your way?' 'You take and split the bean, and cut the wart to get some blood, then you put the blood on one piece of the bean and dig a hole and bury it around midnight at a crossroads during the new moon, and then you burn the other piece of the bean. You see, the piece with the blood on it will keep pulling and pulling, trying to get the other piece to come to it, and that helps the blood draw the wart out, and pretty soon it comes off.' 'Yes, that's right, Huck—that's it; although when you're burying it, if you say 'Down bean; off wart; come no more to bother me!' it's better. That's how Joe Harper does it, and he's traveled almost to Coonville and most everywhere. But tell me—how do you cure them with dead cats?'

That will get rid of any wart.' 'Sounds plausible. Have you ever tried it, Huck?' 'No, but old Mother Hopkins told me.' 'Well, I guess it's true, then. Because they say she's a witch.' 'Say! Why, Tom, I know she is. She put a spell on Dad. Dad says so himself. He came along one day, and he saw she was putting a spell on him, so he picked up a rock, and if she hadn't dodged, he would have hit her. Well, that very night he rolled off a shed where he was lying drunk, and broke his arm.' 'Why, that's terrible. How did he know she was putting a spell on him?' 'Lord, Dad can tell easily. Dad says when they keep staring at you steadily, they're putting a spell on you. Especially if they mumble. Because when they mumble, they're saying the Lord's Prayer backward.' 'Say, Hucky, when are you going to try the cat?' 'Tonight. I guess they'll come for old Hoss Williams tonight.' 'But they buried him Saturday. Didn't they get him Saturday night?' 'Why, what are you talking about! How could their spells work until midnight?—and then it's Sunday. Devils don't hang around much on a Sunday, I don't think.' 'I never thought of that. That's true.

Huckleberry looked at it longingly. The temptation was very strong. Finally, he said: 'Is it genuine?' Tom lifted his lip and showed the empty space. 'Well, okay,' said Huckleberry, 'it's a trade.'

          "paraphrase_gpt-4.1-2025-04-14": "Tom greeted Huckleberry Finn, who responded in kind. Tom asked Huck what he was carrying, and Huck replied that it was a dead cat. Tom wanted to see it, noticed it was very stiff, and inquired where Huck got it. Huck said he bought it from another boy, trading a blue ticket and a bladder from the slaughterhouse. The blue ticket, Huck explained, was bought from Ben Rogers in exchange for a hoop-stick two weeks prior. Tom then asked what dead cats were useful for, and Huck said they could be used to cure warts. Tom expressed disbelief, claiming he knew a better remedy, which was spunk-water. Huck doubted this method, but Tom asked if he'd ever tried it. Huck hadn’t, but said Bob Tanner had. Huck recounted the story as it was passed through many boys before reaching him. He then explained how Bob Tanner used spunk-water—by dipping his hand in the water collected in a rotten stump, during the daytime, possibly facing the stump, but without saying anything. Tom ridiculed this method, saying it wouldn’t work. Instead, he detailed his preferred ritual: you must go to a spunk-water stump at midnight alone, back up to it, jam your hand in, chant a rhyme, then walk away eleven steps with your eyes closed, turn around three times, and return home without speaking to anyone, or the charm is broken. Huck said that wasn’t how Bob Tanner did it, which Tom affirmed, noting Tanner was the wartiest boy in town, so obviously the method didn’t work for him. Tom bragged he’d removed many warts this way due to handling frogs. Sometimes, he used a bean; Huck agreed beans worked and described his process: split a bean, cut the wart to draw blood, put blood on one bean half, bury it at midnight at a crossroads during the dark of the moon, and burn the other half. The two halves try to draw together, pulling the wart off. Tom added that saying a certain phrase while burying it was even better, as Joe Harper did, who had traveled widely. Tom then asked how to cure warts with a dead cat. Huck explained: you go to a graveyard at midnight when a wicked person has been buried; when devils come for the soul, you throw the cat after them while reciting a charm so the warts follow the cat. Tom thought it sounded plausible and asked if Huck had tried it. Huck hadn’t but said Mother Hopkins, reputed to be a witch, told him. Tom agreed this made it credible, and Huck insisted she was a witch because his father, Pap, had been witched by her. Pap claimed he could always tell when someone was witching him by their steady look and mumbling, which meant they were reciting the Lord’s Prayer backward. Tom asked when Huck planned to try the cat, and Huck said that night, since old Hoss Williams’s soul might be taken then. Tom wondered why not earlier, but Huck explained the spells only worked at midnight and not usually on Sundays. Tom asked if he could go along, and Huck agreed as long as Tom wasn’t scared. Tom insisted he wasn’t and planned to meow as a signal; Huck would meow back if he could. Tom recalled last time he couldn’t answer because his aunt was watching, but promised to try now. Suddenly, Tom noticed something—just a tick, which Huck had caught in the woods. Tom wanted to trade for it, offering his tooth. After showing the genuine gap in his mouth, Huck agreed, and Tom put the tick in a box. Satisfied with their trade, the boys parted ways, each feeling like they had gained something valuable."

Take off your jacket.”\nThe master’s arm performed until it was tired and the stock of switches notably diminished. Then the order followed:\n“Now, sir, go and sit with the girls! And let this be a warning to you.”\nThe titter that rippled around the room appeared to abash the boy, but in reality that result was caused rather more by his worshipful awe of his unknown idol and the dread pleasure that lay in his high good fortune. He sat down upon the end of the pine bench and the girl hitched herself away from him with a toss of her head. Nudges and winks and whispers traversed the room, but Tom sat still, with his arms upon the long, low desk before him, and seemed to study his book.\nBy and by attention ceased from him, and the accustomed school murmur rose upon the dull air once more. Presently the boy began to steal furtive glances at the girl. She observed it, “made a mouth” at him and gave him the back of her head for the space of a minute. When she cautiously faced around again, a peach lay before her. She thrust it away. Tom gently put it back. She thrust it away again, but with less animosity. Tom patiently returned it to its place. Then she let it remain. Tom scrawled on his slate, “Please take it—I got more.” The girl glanced at the words, but made no sign. Now the boy began to draw something on the slate, hiding his work with his left hand. For a time the girl refused to notice; but her human curiosity presently began to manifest itself by hardly perceptible signs. The boy worked on, apparently unconscious. The girl made a sort of non-committal attempt to see, but the boy did not betray that he was aware of it. At last she gave in and hesitatingly whispered:\n“Let me see it.”\nTom partly uncovered a dismal caricature of a house with two gable ends to it and a corkscrew of smoke issuing from the chimney. Then the girl’s interest began to fasten itself upon the work and she forgot everything else. When it was finished, she gazed a moment, then whispered:\n“It’s nice—make a man.”\nThe artist erected a man in the front yard, that resembled a derrick. He could have stepped over the house; but the girl was not hypercritical; she was satisfied with the monster, and whispered:\n“It’s a beautiful man—now make me coming along.”\nTom drew an hour-glass with a full moon and straw limbs to it and armed the spreading fingers with a portentous fan. The girl said:\n“It’s ever so nice—I wish I could draw.”\n“It’s easy,” whispered Tom, “I’ll learn you.”\n“Oh, will you? When?”\n“At noon. Do you go home to dinner?”\n“I’ll stay if you will.”\n“Good—that’s a whack. What’s your name?”\n“Becky Thatcher. What’s yours? Oh, I know. It’s Thomas Sawyer.”\n“That’s the name they lick me by. I’m Tom when I’m good. You call me Tom, will you?”\n“Yes.”\nNow Tom began to scrawl something on the slate, hiding the words from the girl. But she was not backward this time. She begged to see. Tom said:\n“Oh, it ain’t anything.”\n“Yes it is.”\n“No it ain’t. You don’t want to see.”\n“Yes I do, indeed I do. Please let me.”\n“You’ll tell.”\n“No I won’t—deed and deed and double deed won’t.”\n“You won’t tell anybody at all? Ever, as long as you live?”\n“No, I won’t ever tell anybody. Now let me.”\n“Oh, you don’t want to see!”\n“Now that you treat me so, I will see.” And she put her small hand upon his and a little scuffle ensued, Tom pretending to resist in earnest but letting his hand slip by degrees till these words were revealed: “I love you.”\n“Oh, you bad thing!” And she hit his hand a smart rap, but reddened and looked pleased, nevertheless.",

A simple ruler won't be enough punishment for this misbehavior. Take off your coat.” The master’s arm worked tirelessly, and the bundle of switches was significantly reduced. Then came the command: “Now, young man, go sit over there with the girls! And let this teach you a lesson.” The suppressed giggling that spread through the room seemed to make the boy uncomfortable, but in truth, his discomfort was more a result of his worshipful admiration for the unfamiliar girl and the thrilling, slightly scary happiness he felt about his fortunate situation. He sat down at the edge of the wooden bench, and the girl moved away from him with a flip of her head. Students all around the room exchanged nudges, winks, and whispered comments, but Tom remained still, with his arms resting on the long, low desk in front of him, appearing to study his book. Eventually, the attention shifted away from him, and the usual low hum of the schoolroom filled the air once more. Soon, the boy began to sneak hesitant glances at the girl. She noticed him, made a face at him, and presented him with the back of her head for about a minute. When she cautiously turned around again, a peach was lying in front of her. She pushed it away. Tom gently placed it back. She pushed it away again, but with less hostility this time. Tom patiently returned it to its place. Then she allowed it to stay. Tom wrote on his slate, “Please take it—I have others.” The girl looked at the words but gave no sign that she had read them. Now the boy started drawing something on the slate, shielding his work with his left hand. For a time, the girl refused to acknowledge it; but her inherent human curiosity soon began to show through subtle signs. The boy continued working, seemingly oblivious. The girl made a kind of hesitant attempt to see, but the boy didn't let on that he was aware of her curiosity. Finally, she gave in and whispered hesitantly: “Let me see it.” Tom partially revealed a rather poor drawing of a house with two pointed roofs and smoke winding like a corkscrew from the chimney. The girl's interest immediately became focused on the drawing, and she forgot everything else. When he finished it, she looked at it for a moment, then whispered: “It’s nice—draw a man.” The artist created a man in the front yard who looked like a construction crane. He was so tall he could have easily stepped over the house; but the girl wasn't picky; she was happy with the unusual figure, and whispered: “He’s a wonderful man—now draw me coming towards him.” Tom drew a figure that looked like an hourglass with a round head and stick-like arms and legs, giving the outstretched fingers a large, noticeable fan. The girl said: “It’s absolutely lovely—I wish I could draw.” “It’s easy,” whispered Tom, “I’ll teach you.” “Oh, you will? When?” “During lunch. Do you go home for lunch?” “I’ll stay here if you do.” “Good—that's settled. What’s your name?” “Becky Thatcher. What’s yours? Oh, I already know. It’s Thomas Sawyer.” “That's the name they use when they spank me. I’m Tom when I’m being good. Will you call me Tom?” “Yes.” Then Tom began writing something else on the slate, hiding the words from the girl. But this time, she was not hesitant. She begged him to let her see. Tom said: “Oh, it’s nothing really.” “Yes it is.” “No it’s not. You wouldn’t want to see it.” “Yes I would, truly I would. Please let me see.” “You’ll tell someone.” “No I won’t—cross my heart and double promise I won’t.” “You won’t tell anyone at all? Never, for as long as you live?” “No, I will never tell anyone. Now let me see.” “Oh, you truly don’t want to see!” “Since you’re acting like this, now I absolutely *have* to see.” And she placed her small hand on his, and a small struggle ensued, with Tom pretending to resist seriously but allowing his hand to slowly move until these words were visible: “I love you.” “Oh, you naughty thing!” she exclaimed, giving his hand a light slap. However, she blushed deeply and looked pleased nonetheless.",

Let this serve as a lesson to you.\" Laughter rippled around the classroom, which seemed to embarrass Tom; but in truth, his discomfort was more from awe of the girl he admired and the nervous delight at his fortunate position. He sat at the end of the pine bench, and the girl moved away from him with a toss of her head. The other students nudged each other, winked, and whispered, but Tom remained still, arms on the desk, pretending to study. Soon, everyone stopped looking at him, and the murmur of regular school activity filled the air again. Tom began stealing quick glances at the girl, who noticed, made a face at him, and turned away for a minute. When she looked back, she found a peach in front of her. She pushed it aside. Tom put it back. She pushed it away again, but less harshly. Tom patiently replaced it. This time, she left it there. Tom wrote on his slate, \"Please take it—I have more.\" The girl read it but didn’t react. Tom then began drawing something on the slate, shielding it with his hand. For a while, the girl ignored him, but soon her curiosity took over. Tom kept drawing, acting as though he hadn’t noticed. Eventually, she gave in and whispered, \"Let me see it.\" Tom partly revealed a crude drawing of a house with twin gable roofs and a spiral of smoke from the chimney. Her attention shifted to his drawing, forgetting everything else. When he finished, she looked at it briefly and whispered, \"It’s nice—draw a man.\" Tom drew a man in the front yard, who looked like a derrick, towering over the house; but the girl didn’t mind the odd size, and whispered, \"It’s a beautiful man—now draw me coming along.\" Tom drew a figure with an hourglass, a round moon face, stick limbs, and a large fan for fingers. The girl said, \"It’s so nice—I wish I could draw.\" Tom whispered, \"It’s easy, I’ll teach you.\" \"Oh really? When?\" \"At noon.

Please let me.\" \"But you’ll tell.\" \"No I won’t—really, I absolutely won’t.\" \"You won’t tell anyone? Ever?\" \"Never.\" \"Oh, you really don’t want to see!\" \"Now that you say that, I definitely do!\" She put her little hand on his, and a playful struggle began, Tom pretending to resist but slowly letting her see the writing: \"I love you.\" \"Oh, you naughty thing!\" She slapped his hand, but blushed and looked happy nonetheless."

He then participated in the reading lesson and completely mishandled it; following that, in the geography lesson, he confused lakes with mountains, mountains with rivers, and rivers with continents, bringing about utter disorder once more; subsequently, in the spelling lesson, he was 'sent down,' failing simple, basic words in succession, until he ended up at the very bottom of the class and was forced to hand over the pewter medal he had shown off for many months.",

The drowsing murmur of the five and twenty studying scholars soothed the soul like the spell that is in the murmur of bees. Away off in the flaming sunshine, Cardiff Hill lifted its soft green sides through a shimmering veil of heat, tinted with the purple of distance; a few birds floated on lazy wing high in the air; no other living thing was visible but some cows, and they were asleep. Tom’s heart ached to be free, or else to have something of interest to do to pass the dreary time. His hand wandered into his pocket and his face lit up with a glow of gratitude that was prayer, though he did not know it. Then furtively the percussion-cap box came out.

The tick, too, probably felt a surge of relief, but it was short-lived: as the tick began to explore, Tom used a pin to redirect it along a new path."

While one boy was worrying the tick with absorbing interest, the other would look on with interest as strong, the two heads bowed together over the slate, and the two souls dead to all things else. At last luck seemed to settle and abide with Joe. The tick tried this, that, and the other course, and got as excited and as anxious as the boys themselves, but time and again just as he would have victory in his very grasp, so to speak, and Tom’s fingers would be twitching to begin, Joe’s pin would deftly head him off, and keep possession. At last Tom could stand it no longer. The temptation was too strong. So he reached out and lent a hand with his pin. Joe was angry in a moment.

The tick tried going this way and that, getting as frantic and agitated as the boys themselves, but time after time, just when it looked like it might succeed in crossing, and Tom's fingers were ready to jump in, Joe's pin would skillfully block it and keep it on his side. Finally, Tom couldn't take it anymore. The urge was too strong. He reached out and used his pin to help. Joe immediately became angry. He said, \"Tom, leave him alone.\" Tom argued, \"I just wanted to poke him a little, Joe.\" Joe insisted, \"No way, that's not fair; just leave him alone.\" Tom grumbled, \"Oh, come on, I'm not going to bother him much.\" \"Leave him alone, I said!\" Joe repeated. \"I won't!\" Tom retorted. \"You have to—he's on my side of the line!\" Tom challenged, \"Listen, Joe Harper, whose tick is that anyway?\" Joe didn't care, stating, \"It doesn't matter whose tick it is—he's on my side of the line, and you are not touching him.\" Tom doubled down, \"Well, I'll bet I will, though.

Joe poked at it for a while, but then it managed to cross back. This back-and-forth happened several times. While one boy played with the tick, the other watched, both boys completely absorbed in the game, their heads close together over the slate, ignoring everything around them.

I wish I had some right now.\" \"Do you? I have some.

Do you recall what I wrote on the chalkboard?\" Tom pressed. \"Uh-huh,\" she replied hesitantly. \"What was it?\" he prompted. \"I won't tell you,\" she said. \"Should I tell you?\" Tom asked. \"Yes, please, but maybe another time,\" she requested. \"No, let's do it now,\" he insisted. \"Not now, tomorrow,\" she countered. \"Oh, come on, now. Please, Becky, I'll whisper it very softly,\" he urged. Seeing her hesitation, Tom took her silence as agreement, put his arm around her waist, and whispered the message gently into her ear. He then added, \"Now you whisper the same thing to me.\" She resisted initially but eventually said, \"Turn your face away so you can't see, and I will. But promise you'll never tell anyone, Tom, okay? You really won't, will you?\" \"No, honestly, I absolutely won't. Go on, Becky,\" he assured her. He looked away. Timidly, she leaned around him, her breath brushing his hair, and whispered, \"I... love... you!\" Immediately after, she darted away, running in circles around the furniture with Tom chasing her, finally hiding in a corner with her apron covering her face. Tom caught up, put his arms around her neck, and pleaded, \"Okay, Becky, it's all done now, except for the kiss. Don't be scared of that; it's nothing at all. Please, Becky.\" He gently pulled at her apron and hands. Eventually, she gave in, letting her hands drop. Her face, flushed from the exertion and emotion, looked up and submitted. Tom kissed her lips and declared, \"Alright, it's completely settled now, Becky. And from now on, you must never love anyone but me, and you must never marry anyone but me, not ever, forever and ever. Agreed?\" \"Yes, I'll never love anyone but you, Tom, and I'll never marry anyone but you—and you're not allowed to ever marry anyone but me, either,\" she agreed. \"Absolutely. Of course. That's part of the deal. And when we're going to or from school, we'll walk together when no one is watching—and we'll choose each other at parties, because that's what engaged people do,\" Tom explained. \"That sounds wonderful.

He wondered what would happen if he simply turned away and vanished without a trace. What if he went far away, to unknown lands across the ocean, and never returned? How would she feel then? The idea of becoming a clown crossed his mind again but immediately disgusted him. Being silly, telling jokes, and wearing bright, spotted clothes felt wrong when his mind was filled with elevated, romantic notions. No, instead he decided he would become a soldier, returning years later, worn by battle but famous. Or even better, he would join the Native Americans, hunting buffalo, fighting battles in the mountains and vast, empty plains of the Far West. Later, he would come back as a great chief, covered in feathers and war paint, and storm into Sunday school on a quiet summer morning with a terrifying yell, making all his friends burn with intense jealousy. But then, something even more exciting occurred to him. He would be a pirate! That was it! His future now seemed clear, brilliantly shining with unimaginable greatness. How his name would become famous across the world and cause people to tremble! How grandly he would sail the lively seas in his long, sleek black ship, the Spirit of the Storm, with his fearsome flag flying ahead! And at the height of his fame, he would suddenly appear in his old village and march into church, tanned and rugged, dressed in his black velvet jacket and trousers, tall boots, red sash, a belt loaded with pistols, his sword hanging at his side, a feathered hat, and his black flag with the skull and crossbones unfurled. He would listen with great delight as people whispered, 'It's Tom Sawyer the Pirate!—the Black Avenger of the Spanish Main!'",

Soon, Tom found himself gradually becoming involved in the everyday matters of life once more. He wondered what would happen if he left now and vanished mysteriously. What if he traveled far, to distant, unknown lands and never returned? How would she feel about that? The notion of becoming a clown came to him again, but now it disgusted him—silliness and jokes seemed inappropriate for someone whose mind was filled with dreamy, heroic thoughts. Instead, he imagined himself as a soldier, returning home after many years, battered but famous from war. Or better yet, he could join the Indians, hunting buffalo and going to battle in the remote mountains and vast prairies of the West. Then, much later, he would return as a great chief, covered in feathers and war paint, bursting into Sunday school on a sleepy summer morning, impressing all his friends with envy. But he thought of something even grander: he would become a pirate! Suddenly, his life ahead looked bright and extraordinary. He imagined his name becoming famous, making people tremble at its mention. He would sail majestically over the ocean in his sleek, dark ship, the Spirit of the Storm, flying his fearsome flag. At the peak of his fame, he would unexpectedly arrive back at his old village, striding into church weather-beaten and proud, dressed as a pirate with his impressive gear, and listen with delight as people whispered, \"It’s Tom Sawyer the Pirate!—the Black Avenger of the Spanish Main!\""

Therefore he must now begin to get ready. He would collect his resources together. He went to a rotten log near at hand and began to dig under one end of it with his Barlow knife. He soon struck wood that sounded hollow. He put his hand there and uttered this incantation impressively:\n“What hasn’t come here, come! What’s here, stay here!”\nThen he scraped away the dirt, and exposed a pine shingle. He took it up and disclosed a shapely little treasure-house whose bottom and sides were of shingles. In it lay a marble. Tom’s astonishment was boundless! He scratched his head with a perplexed air, and said:\n“Well, that beats anything!”\nThen he tossed the marble away pettishly, and stood cogitating. The truth was, that a superstition of his had failed, here, which he and all his comrades had always looked upon as infallible. If you buried a marble with certain necessary incantations, and left it alone a fortnight, and then opened the place with the incantation he had just used, you would find that all the marbles you had ever lost had gathered themselves together there, meantime, no matter how widely they had been separated. But now, this thing had actually and unquestionably failed. Tom’s whole structure of faith was shaken to its foundations. He had many a time heard of this thing succeeding but never of its failing before. It did not occur to him that he had tried it several times before, himself, but could never find the hiding-places afterward. He puzzled over the matter some time, and finally decided that some witch had interfered and broken the charm. He thought he would satisfy himself on that point; so he searched around till he found a small sandy spot with a little funnel-shaped depression in it. He laid himself down and put his mouth close to this depression and called—\n“Doodle-bug, doodle-bug, tell me what I want to know! Doodle-bug, doodle-bug, tell me what I want to know!”\nThe sand began to work, and presently a small black bug appeared for a second and then darted under again in a fright.\n“He dasn’t tell! So it was a witch that done it. I just knowed it.”\nHe well knew the futility of trying to contend against witches, so he gave up discouraged.",
          "paraphrase_gemini-2.5-flash-preview-04-17": "Yes, it was settled; his future path was decided. He resolved to run away from home and embark on this new life. He would begin the very next morning. Therefore, he needed to start preparing right away. He would gather his belongings. He approached a decaying log nearby and began to dig beneath one end of it with his pocketknife. Soon, his knife hit wood that sounded hollow. He placed his hand there and solemnly recited this charm: \"What isn’t here, come! What is here, remain!\" He then scraped away the dirt, revealing a pine shingle. He lifted it, uncovering a small, well-made container lined with shingles. Inside lay a single marble. Tom was utterly astonished! He scratched his head with a puzzled look and exclaimed, \"Well, that's unbelievable!\" Then, he petulantly tossed the marble away and stood deep in thought. The truth was, a deeply held superstition he and his friends considered absolutely reliable had just failed him. According to this belief, if you buried a marble with specific spells, left it for two weeks, and then opened the spot with the same incantation he had just used, all the marbles you had ever lost, no matter where, would have magically gathered there. But now, this rule had definitively and unexpectedly proven false. Tom's entire foundation of belief was severely shaken. He had heard many stories of this working but never of it failing before. It didn't occur to him that he himself had tried it multiple times previously without ever being able to find the hiding places again. He pondered the problem for a while and finally concluded that some witch must have interfered and broken the spell. He decided to confirm this suspicion; so, he searched until he found a small sandy area with a little cone-shaped dip in it. He lay down, put his mouth close to the depression, and called out—\"Doodle-bug, doodle-bug, tell me what I want to know! Doodle-bug, doodle-bug, tell me what I want to know!\" The sand began to shift, and presently, a small black insect appeared for a moment before quickly burrowing back down in fear. \"He doesn’t dare tell! So it *was* a witch who did it. I just knew it.\" He was well aware that trying to fight witches was pointless, so he gave up, feeling discouraged.",
          "paraphrase_gpt-4.1-2025-04-14": "It was decided—he knew what he was going to do with his life. Tom would run away and begin his new adventure, starting first thing in the morning. So now, he needed to get ready. He began by gathering his supplies. Tom moved over to a nearby rotting log and used his Barlow knife to dig underneath it. Before long, he hit something that sounded hollow, so he reached in and recited a magic phrase: “What hasn’t come here, come! What’s here, stay here!” He cleared away the dirt and uncovered a pine shingle. Lifting it, he found a carefully made little box built out of shingles. Inside was just one marble. Tom was completely surprised! He scratched his head in confusion and exclaimed, “Well, that beats anything!” Annoyed, he threw the marble away and stood thinking. See, one of his firmest superstitious beliefs had failed. He and his friends always believed if you buried a marble with the right spell, left it for two weeks, and then dug it up while repeating the incantation, all your lost marbles would have gathered there again, no matter how scattered they’d been. But this time, it hadn’t worked. Tom’s confidence in this belief was shaken—he had always heard it worked, never that it failed. He didn’t remember that he’d tried this before and just couldn’t find the spots again. He considered for a while, and finally decided that a witch must have interfered with the charm. To check, he searched for a sandy spot with a depression, lay down, and called into it, “Doodle-bug, doodle-bug, tell me what I want to know! Doodle-bug, doodle-bug, tell me what I want to know!” Soon, the sand moved and a small black bug appeared, then quickly disappeared again in fear. Tom said, “He doesn’t dare say! So it was a witch who did it. I just knew it.” He knew he couldn’t fight witches, so he gave up, feeling defeated."

Who comes here into Sherwood Forest without my pass?”\n“Guy of Guisborne wants no man’s pass. Who art thou that—that—”\n“Dares to hold such language,” said Tom, prompting—for they talked “by the book,” from memory.\n“Who art thou that dares to hold such language?”\n“I, indeed! I am Robin Hood, as thy caitiff carcase soon shall know.”\n“Then art thou indeed that famous outlaw? Right gladly will I dispute with thee the passes of the merry wood. Have at thee!”\nThey took their lath swords, dumped their other traps on the ground, struck a fencing attitude, foot to foot, and began a grave, careful combat, “two up and two down.” Presently Tom said:\n“Now, if you’ve got the hang, go it lively!”\nSo they “went it lively,” panting and perspiring with the work. By and by Tom shouted:\n“Fall! fall! Why don’t you fall?”\n“I sha’n’t! Why don’t you fall yourself? You’re getting the worst of it.”\n“Why, that ain’t anything. I can’t fall; that ain’t the way it is in the book. The book says, ‘Then with one back-handed stroke he slew poor Guy of Guisborne.’ You’re to turn around and let me hit you in the back.”\nThere was no getting around the authorities, so Joe turned, received the whack and fell.\n“Now,” said Joe, getting up, “you got to let me kill you. That’s fair.”\n“Why, I can’t do that, it ain’t in the book.”\n“Well, it’s blamed mean—that’s all.”\n“Well, say, Joe, you can be Friar Tuck or Much the miller’s son, and lam me with a quarter-staff; or I’ll be the Sheriff of Nottingham and you be Robin Hood a little while and kill me.”\nThis was satisfactory, and so these adventures were carried out. Then Tom became Robin Hood again, and was allowed by the treacherous nun to bleed his strength away through his neglected wound. And at last Joe, representing a whole tribe of weeping outlaws, dragged him sadly forth, gave his bow into his feeble hands, and Tom said, “Where this arrow falls, there bury poor Robin Hood under the greenwood tree.” Then he shot the arrow and fell back and would have died, but he lit on a nettle and sprang up too gaily for a corpse.",

Stay hidden until I give the signal.”\nJust then, Joe Harper appeared, dressed as lightly and equipped as elaborately as Tom. Tom called out:\n“Stop! Who dares to enter Sherwood Forest without my permission?”\n“Guy of Gisbourne doesn’t need anyone’s permission. Who are you that—that—”\n“Holds such language,” Tom prompted, as their dialogue was recited “exactly as in the book” from memory.\n“Who are you that holds such language?”\n“I, indeed! I am Robin Hood, as your wretched body will soon discover.”\n“Then you are truly that renowned outlaw? I will gladly challenge you for control of the paths through this cheerful wood. Prepare yourself!”\nThey picked up their wooden swords, dropped their other gear onto the ground, assumed fencing stances facing each other, and began a serious, deliberate duel, following specific moves. After a while, Tom said:\n“Now that you understand it, let’s do it quickly!”\nSo they \"did it quickly,\" breathing heavily and sweating from the effort. Soon, Tom yelled:\n“Fall! Fall! Why aren’t you falling?”\n“I won’t! Why don’t *you* fall? You’re losing.”\n“That’s not important. I can’t fall; that’s not how it happens in the book. The book says, ‘Then with a single backhanded blow he killed poor Guy of Gisbourne.’ You have to turn around and let me hit your back.”\nThere was no arguing with the source material, so Joe turned, took the blow, and fell.\n“Okay,” said Joe, getting up, “now you have to let me kill you. That’s only fair.”\n“Well, I can’t do that; it’s not in the book.”\n“Well, that’s really unfair—that’s all I can say.”\n“Alright, look, Joe, you can pretend to be Friar Tuck or Much the miller’s son and hit me with a quarterstaff; or I’ll be the Sheriff of Nottingham, and you can be Robin Hood for a bit and kill me.”\nThis arrangement was acceptable, and they carried out these other pretend fights. Then Tom became Robin Hood again and allowed himself to weaken and “bleed out” through his unattended wound, as described by the disloyal nun. Finally, Joe, pretending to be a group of crying outlaws, sadly pulled him away, placed his bow in his weak hands, and Tom declared, “Where this arrow lands, bury poor Robin Hood beneath the greenwood tree.” He then shot the arrow and slumped back, ready to “die,” but he landed on a stinging nettle and jumped up too lively for a dead person.",

Who are you that—that—\"\n\nTom helped him with the lines, as they recited from memory: \"Who are you that dares to say such things?\"\n\n\"Me! I'm Robin Hood, as you’ll soon find out when I defeat you!\"\n\n\"So you really are the famous outlaw? Then I am eager to challenge you for the right to pass through the merry woods. Let’s fight!\"\n\nThey dropped their extra props, took up their toy swords, got into fencing stances, and began a serious mock-battle, striking twice high and twice low. After a while, Tom said, \"If you know the moves now, let’s make it exciting!\"\n\nSo they fought more energetically, soon out of breath and sweating. Eventually Tom cried, \"Fall! Fall down! Why aren’t you falling?\"\n\n\"I won’t! Why don’t you fall? You’re the one losing now.\"\n\n\"That doesn't matter. I can't fall; that’s not what’s supposed to happen in the story. The book says, ‘Then with one back-handed stroke he killed poor Guy of Guisborne.’ You have to turn around so I can hit you from behind.\"\n\nKnowing they had to follow the story, Joe turned around, let Tom hit him, and fell down.\n\nJoe got up and said, \"Now you have to let me kill you. That’s only fair.\"\n\n\"But I can’t! That’s not how it happens in the book.\"\n\n\"Well, that’s really unfair, that’s all.\"\n\n\"Tell you what, Joe, you can be Friar Tuck or Much the miller’s son and beat me with a staff. Or I'll be the Sheriff of Nottingham and you can play Robin Hood for a bit and kill me.\"\n\nJoe liked this, and they acted out those scenes too. Then Tom was Robin Hood again, and a false nun let his wound be neglected until he grew weak. Finally, Joe, playing all the grieving outlaws, dragged him away, gave Robin his bow, and Tom declared, \"Where this arrow goes, there bury poor Robin Hood under the green tree.\" He shot the arrow, fell down to die dramatically—but landed on a stinging nettle and jumped up, ruining his act of dying."

When it seemed to him that it must be nearly daylight, he heard the clock strike ten! This was despair. He would have tossed and fidgeted, as his nerves demanded, but he was afraid he might wake Sid. So he lay still, and stared up into the dark. Everything was dismally still. By and by, out of the stillness, little, scarcely perceptible noises began to emphasize themselves. The ticking of the clock began to bring itself into notice. Old beams began to crack mysteriously. The stairs creaked faintly. Evidently spirits were abroad. A measured, muffled snore issued from Aunt Polly’s chamber. And now the tiresome chirping of a cricket that no human ingenuity could locate, began. Next the ghastly ticking of a death-watch in the wall at the bed’s head made Tom shudder—it meant that somebody’s days were numbered. Then the howl of a far-off dog rose on the night air, and was answered by a fainter howl from a remoter distance. Tom was in an agony. At last he was satisfied that time had ceased and eternity begun; he began to doze, in spite of himself; the clock chimed eleven, but he did not hear it. And then there came, mingling with his half-formed dreams, a most melancholy caterwauling. The raising of a neighboring window disturbed him. A cry of “Scat! you devil!” and the crash of an empty bottle against the back of his aunt’s woodshed brought him wide awake, and a single minute later he was dressed and out of the window and creeping along the roof of the “ell” on all fours. He “meow’d” with caution once or twice, as he went; then jumped to the roof of the woodshed and thence to the ground. Huckleberry Finn was there, with his dead cat. The boys moved off and disappeared in the gloom. At the end of half an hour they were wading through the tall grass of the graveyard.",

Tom, however, remained awake, waiting with restless impatience. Thinking it must be nearly morning, he was frustrated to hear the clock only strike ten. His nerves urged him to toss and fidget, but he was afraid of waking Sid, so he lay perfectly still, staring into the dark room. A heavy silence settled everywhere. Gradually, faint, almost unnoticed sounds began to become more prominent. The clock's ticking grew louder. Old beams in the house began to make mysterious cracking noises. The stairs gave a soft creak. Tom concluded that spirits were definitely present. A steady, quiet snore came from Aunt Polly's bedroom. Then, the annoying chirping of a cricket, whose exact location was impossible to find, started. Next, the terrifying ticking of a death-watch beetle in the wall near his head made Tom shiver—it was a sign that someone's life was nearing its end. A distant dog's howl then carried on the night air, answered by a softer howl from further away. Tom was in anguish. He finally felt as though time had stopped and eternity had begun; despite himself, he started to drift off to sleep and didn't hear the clock chime eleven. Then, a loud, mournful catfight blended into his half-formed dreams. The opening of a nearby window startled him. A shout of 'Scat! Get out!' and the sound of an empty bottle shattering against the back of his aunt's woodshed fully roused him. Within a minute, he was dressed, had climbed out the window, and was cautiously moving on his hands and knees along the roof of the 'ell' wing. He carefully meowed once or twice as he went, then jumped onto the woodshed roof and from there to the ground. Huckleberry Finn was waiting for him, holding his dead cat. The two boys departed, disappearing into the darkness. Thirty minutes later, they were wading through the tall grass in the graveyard.",

Tom, however, stayed awake, feeling impatient and anxious. Convinced that morning must be near, he was dismayed to hear the clock only striking ten. He wanted to toss and turn to ease his nerves but didn't want to risk waking Sid, so he remained motionless, staring into the darkness. The house was eerily quiet, and soon subtle sounds became more noticeable: the ticking clock, creaking beams, faint sounds from the stairs—as if ghosts were stirring. From Aunt Polly’s room came a soft, rhythmic snore. Then a cricket began chirping somewhere impossible to find, followed by the unsettling ticking of a death-watch beetle near Tom’s head, which made him shiver, thinking it was an omen. Distantly, a dog howled, answered by another even farther away, deepening Tom's distress. He felt as if time had stopped entirely. Eventually, he started to drift off to sleep, missing the eleven o'clock chime altogether. Suddenly, he was woken by a sorrowful caterwauling, a window opening nearby, a shout of, “Scat! you devil!” and a bottle smashing behind Aunt Polly’s woodshed. Now fully awake, Tom quickly dressed, quietly climbed out the window, and crawled across the roof. He carefully imitated a cat's meow, then leaped to the woodshed roof and down to the ground, where Huckleberry Finn waited with his dead cat. The two boys slipped away into the darkness, and half an hour later, they were crossing through the tall grass of the graveyard."

It’s awful solemn like, ain’t it?”\n“I bet it is.”\nThere was a considerable pause, while the boys canvassed this matter inwardly. Then Tom whispered:\n“Say, Hucky—do you reckon Hoss Williams hears us talking?”\n“O’ course he does. Least his sperrit does.”\nTom, after a pause:\n“I wish I’d said Mister Williams. But I never meant any harm. Everybody calls him Hoss.”\n“A body can’t be too partic’lar how they talk ’bout these-yer dead people, Tom.”\nThis was a damper, and conversation died again.\nPresently Tom seized his comrade’s arm and said:\n“Sh!”\n“What is it, Tom?” And the two clung together with beating hearts.\n“Sh! There ’tis again! Didn’t you hear it?”\n“I—”\n“There! Now you hear it.”\n“Lord, Tom, they’re coming! They’re coming, sure. What’ll we do?”\n“I dono. Think they’ll see us?”\n“Oh, Tom, they can see in the dark, same as cats. I wisht I hadn’t come.”\n“Oh, don’t be afeard. I don’t believe they’ll bother us. We ain’t doing any harm. If we keep perfectly still, maybe they won’t notice us at all.”\n“I’ll try to, Tom, but, Lord, I’m all of a shiver.”\n“Listen!”\nThe boys bent their heads together and scarcely breathed. A muffled sound of voices floated up from the far end of the graveyard.\n“Look! See there!” whispered Tom. “What is it?”\n“It’s devil-fire. Oh, Tom, this is awful.”\nSome vague figures approached through the gloom, swinging an old-fashioned tin lantern that freckled the ground with innumerable little spangles of light. Presently Huckleberry whispered with a shudder:\n“It’s the devils sure enough. Three of ’em! Lordy, Tom, we’re goners! Can you pray?”\n“I’ll try, but don’t you be afeard. They ain’t going to hurt us. ‘Now I lay me down to sleep, I—’”\n“Sh!”\n“What is it, Huck?”\n“They’re humans! One of ’em is, anyway. One of ’em’s old Muff Potter’s voice.”\n“No—’tain’t so, is it?”\n“I bet I know it. Don’t you stir nor budge. He ain’t sharp enough to notice us. Drunk, the same as usual, likely—blamed old rip!”\n“All right, I’ll keep still. Now they’re stuck. Can’t find it. Here they come again. Now they’re hot. Cold again. Hot again. Red hot! They’re p’inted right, this time. Say, Huck, I know another o’ them voices; it’s Injun Joe.”\n“That’s so—that murderin’ half-breed! I’d druther they was devils a dern sight.

Tom's thoughts became troubling. He felt he had to start a conversation. So he whispered, \"Hucky, do you think the dead people are okay with us being here?\" Huckleberry whispered back, \"I wish I knew. It feels really serious, doesn't it?\" \"I bet it does.\" There was a lengthy pause while the boys internally considered this idea. Then Tom whispered, \"Hey, Hucky—do you suppose Hoss Williams can hear us talking?\" \"Of course he can. At least his spirit can.\" After a moment, Tom added, \"I wish I'd said Mister Williams. But I didn't mean any disrespect. Everyone calls him Hoss.\" \"You can't be too careful how you speak about dead folks like these, Tom.\" This put a damper on things, and the conversation ceased again. Suddenly, Tom grabbed his friend's arm and said, \"Quiet!\" \"What is it, Tom?\" The two boys clung together, their hearts pounding. \"Quiet! There it is again! Didn't you hear it?\" \"I—\" \"There! Now you hear it.\" \"Oh God, Tom, they're coming! They're definitely coming. What are we going to do?\" \"I don't know. Do you think they'll see us?\" \"Oh, Tom, they can see in the dark just like cats. I wish I hadn't come.\" \"Oh, don't be scared. I don't think they'll bother us. We aren't doing anything wrong. If we stay perfectly still, maybe they won't even notice us.\" \"I'll try, Tom, but gosh, I'm shaking all over.\" \"Listen!\" The boys leaned their heads close together and barely breathed. The faint sound of voices drifted up from the far end of the graveyard. \"Look! See that!\" whispered Tom. \"What is it?\" \"It's spooky fire. Oh, Tom, this is awful.\" Some unclear shapes approached through the darkness, swinging an old tin lantern that scattered countless tiny specks of light across the ground. Soon, Huckleberry whispered with a shiver, \"It's devils for sure. Three of them! Good heavens, Tom, we're done for! Can you pray?\" \"I'll try, but don't be afraid. They aren't going to harm us. 'Now I lay me down to sleep, I—'\" \"Shh!\" \"What's wrong, Huck?\" \"They're humans! One of them is, anyway. One of them has old Muff Potter's voice.\" \"No—that's not right, is it?\" \"I'm positive I recognize it. Don't you move or budge. He's not sharp enough to spot us. Probably drunk, as usual—that darn old scoundrel!\" \"Alright, I'll stay put. Now they're stopped. Can't find it. Here they come again. Now they're warm (closer). Cold again (farther). Warm again. Really warm! They're pointed the right way this time. Say, Huck, I know another one of those voices; it's Injun Joe.\" \"That's right—that murdering mixed-race guy! I'd much rather they were devils. What could they be doing?\" Their whispering ceased completely now, because the three men had reached the grave and were standing just a few feet away from where the boys were hidden. \"Here it is,\" said the third person; and he lifted the lantern, revealing the face of the young Doctor Robinson.",
          "paraphrase_gpt-4.1-2025-04-14": "The boys sat quietly, feeling as if time dragged on. An owl's distant call was the only sound breaking the intense silence. Tom began to feel uncomfortable with his thoughts and decided they needed to talk, so he whispered to Huck, asking if he thought the dead minded their presence. Huck replied in a whisper, saying he wished he knew and noting how serious everything felt. Tom agreed. After a while of thinking it over, Tom asked whether Huck thought Hoss Williams could hear them talking. Huck said that at least his spirit probably could. Tom admitted he wished he'd referred to him as Mister Williams but explained everyone called him Hoss and he didn't mean any disrespect. Huck replied that you had to be careful about how you talked about the dead. This made things quiet again.\n\nSoon, Tom grabbed Huck's arm, urging him to be quiet because he heard something. The boys, startled, clung to each other. Tom insisted he heard it again, and as Huck began to panic about people coming, Tom tried to reassure him that if they stayed perfectly quiet, they might not be noticed. Huck nervously agreed to try though he was shaking.\n\nThey listened and soon heard distant voices. Tom pointed out something and Huck worried it was \"devil-fire.\" Through the darkness, some shadowy figures appeared, carrying a lantern that speckled the ground with light. Shivering, Huck whispered that it must be devils, and asked Tom if he could pray. Tom tried to comfort him and began a prayer, but Huck interrupted, realizing the figures were actually people—he recognized Muff Potter's voice. Tom was surprised but promised to stay still. Huck said Muff was probably drunk, as usual. The men seemed to be searching and moving about, and Tom heard another voice he recognized as Injun Joe. Huck agreed and said he'd rather face devils than the likes of Injun Joe, wondering what the men were planning. At that point, the whispers stopped entirely because the three men had reached the grave and were very close to the boys' hiding spot. One of the men announced they’d found it, lifted the lantern, and lit up the face of young Doctor Robinson."

          "paraphrase_gemini-2.5-flash-preview-04-17": "Potter and Injun Joe arrived carrying a handbarrow, a rope, and a couple of shovels. They set down their equipment and began to excavate the grave. The doctor placed the lantern at the grave's edge and sat down, leaning against an elm tree, so close the boys watching could have reached him. \"Hurry up, fellas!\" he said softly, \"the moon could appear any second.\" They grumbled a reply and continued digging. For a while, the only sound was the scraping of the shovels as they dumped earth and gravel. It was quite repetitive. Eventually, a shovel struck the coffin with a muffled, wooden sound, and within a minute or two, they had lifted it out onto the ground. Using their shovels, they forced open the lid, took out the body, and roughly dropped it on the ground. The moon emerged from behind the clouds, revealing the pale face. They prepared the handbarrow, put the corpse on it, covered it with a blanket, and secured it in place with the rope. Potter took out a large pocket knife, cut off the loose end of the rope, and then stated, \"Alright, Sawbones, the damn thing's ready, and you're going to cough up another five, or it stays right here.\" \"That's right!\" added Injun Joe. \"Hold on, what's going on?\" the doctor questioned. \"You asked for your payment upfront, and I gave it to you.\" \"Yeah, and you did more than just pay,\" said Injun Joe, moving closer to the doctor, who was now standing. \"Five years ago, you kicked me out of your father's kitchen late one night when I was just looking for something to eat, and you claimed I wasn't there for any good reason; and when I vowed I'd settle the score even if it took a century, your father had me thrown in jail for vagrancy. Did you honestly think I'd forget? My Indian blood isn't for nothing. And now I've got you where I want you, and you know you have to make amends!\" By this point, he was confronting the doctor, his fist held near his face, issuing the threat.",
          "paraphrase_gpt-4.1-2025-04-14": "Potter and Injun Joe were carrying a stretcher loaded with a rope and a couple of shovels. After they dropped their things, they began to dig up the grave. The doctor placed his lantern at the head of the grave and sat down with his back against an elm tree, so near the boys hiding nearby that they could have nearly touched him. Speaking softly, the doctor urged, \"Hurry up, men! The moon could come out at any second.\" The men grumbled in reply and kept digging. For a while, nothing could be heard except the scraping sound of the shovels as they dug through the dirt and gravel—a sound that was dull and repetitive. Soon, one shovel hit the coffin with a wooden thud, and after a few minutes, the men lifted the coffin out of the ground. They used their shovels to pry off the lid, pulled out the body, and rather roughly placed it on the ground. Just then, the moon emerged from behind the clouds, revealing the pale face of the corpse. They prepared the stretcher, put the body on it, covered it with a blanket, and tied it down with the rope. Potter took out a big spring-knife, cut off the loose end of the rope, and said, \"Now it’s ready, Doc, but you need to hand over another five dollars, or the corpse stays here.\" \"That's right!\" added Injun Joe. The doctor protested, \"What do you mean? I paid you in advance, as agreed.\" Injun Joe stepped closer to the doctor, who had gotten to his feet, and replied, \"Not only that, but five years ago you chased me away from your dad’s kitchen when I came looking for food. You accused me of bad intentions, and then your father had me jailed as a vagrant when I swore to get back at you someday. Did you think I’d let that go? My blood doesn’t forget. Now it’s payback time—so you’d better settle up!\" By now he was threatening the doctor, shaking his fist in his face."

I’m all in a muddle; can’t recollect anything of it, hardly. Tell me, Joe—honest, now, old feller—did I do it? Joe, I never meant to—’pon my soul and honor, I never meant to, Joe. Tell me how it was, Joe. Oh, it’s awful—and him so young and promising.”\n“Why, you two was scuffling, and he fetched you one with the headboard and you fell flat; and then up you come, all reeling and staggering like, and snatched the knife and jammed it into him, just as he fetched you another awful clip—and here you’ve laid, as dead as a wedge til now.”\n“Oh, I didn’t know what I was a-doing. I wish I may die this minute if I did. It was all on account of the whiskey and the excitement, I reckon. I never used a weepon in my life before, Joe. I’ve fought, but never with weepons. They’ll all say that. Joe, don’t tell! Say you won’t tell, Joe—that’s a good feller. I always liked you, Joe, and stood up for you, too. Don’t you remember? You won’t tell, will you, Joe?” And the poor creature dropped on his knees before the stolid murderer, and clasped his appealing hands.\n“No, you’ve always been fair and square with me, Muff Potter, and I won’t go back on you.

Joe, I swear on my life and honor, I never intended to, Joe. Please tell me what happened, Joe. Oh, it’s horrible—and he was so young and full of potential.” “Well, you two were struggling, and he hit you with the headboard, knocking you down; then you got up, reeling and unsteady, grabbed the knife, and plunged it into him just as he struck you another hard blow—and you’ve been lying here unconscious until now.” “Oh, I didn’t know what I was doing. I hope I die right now if I did. It must have been the whiskey and the excitement, I guess. I’ve never used a weapon in my life before, Joe. I’ve fought with my fists, but never with weapons. Everyone will tell you that. Joe, don’t say anything! Promise you won’t tell, Joe—be a good friend. I’ve always liked you, Joe, and defended you too. Remember? You won’t tell, will you, Joe?” And the distressed man fell to his knees before the emotionless killer, clasping his hands together in a plea. “No, you’ve always treated me fairly, Muff Potter, and I won’t betray you. There, I can’t say fairer than that.” “Oh, Joe, you’re a saint. I’ll be grateful to you for this for the rest of my days.” And Potter started to cry. “Alright, that’s enough of that. This is no time for crying. You head that way, and I’ll go this way. Go on now, and be careful not to leave any footprints.” Potter began to trot, quickly breaking into a run.

It’s terrible—he was so young, with so much ahead of him.”\n“Well, you two were fighting, and he hit you with the headboard making you fall flat; then you got up, stumbling around, grabbed the knife, and stabbed him—right as he hit you again. And you’ve been lying there, out cold, ever since.”\n“I didn’t know what I was doing. God strike me down if I did. It must’ve been the whiskey and all the commotion.

Promise you won’t tell, Joe?” The pitiful man dropped to his knees before the impassive killer, pleading with clasped hands.\n“No, Muff Potter, you’ve always been fair with me, and I won’t betray you. That’s as good a promise as you’ll get.”\n“Oh, Joe, you’re a saint. I’ll be grateful for this as long as I live.” Potter started to cry.\n“All right, that’s enough. This isn’t the time for tears. You go that way, I’ll go this way. Move now, and don’t leave a trace.”\nPotter started off at a jog, quickly breaking into a run. The half-breed watched him leave and muttered to himself:\n“If he’s really as dazed and drunk as he seemed, he won't remember the knife until he’s too far gone to come back for it alone—what a coward.”\nA few minutes later, only the moon watched over the corpse and the open grave.

Eventually, their heartbeats slowed, and Tom whispered,\n\n'Huck, what do you think is going to happen because of this?'\n\n'If Doctor Robinson dies, I guess there will be a hanging.'\n\n'Do you really think so?'\n\n'I know it, Tom.'\n\nTom was silent for a while, then asked, 'Who will tell? Us?'\n\n'What are you saying? Just imagine if something happened and Injun Joe wasn’t hanged. He’d come after us someday, that’s for sure.'\n\n'That’s exactly what I was thinking, Huck.'"

He had liquor in him; I could see that; and besides, he always has. Well, when pap’s full, you might take and belt him over the head with a church and you couldn’t phase him.

Huck questioned why Muff wouldn't know. Tom explained it was because Muff had just been struck unconscious when Injun Joe committed the deed, and he doubted Muff could have seen or known anything. Huck exclaimed that Tom was correct. Tom then suggested that the blow might have even killed Muff. Huck thought that wasn't probable. He noted that Muff had been drinking heavily, as usual, and added that when his own father was drunk, you could hit him hard on the head with something large like a church and it wouldn't affect him at all, according to his father. So, he reasoned, it was probably the same for Muff Potter. However, he conceded that a sober person might be seriously injured by such a blow; he wasn't sure. After another thoughtful pause, Tom asked Huck if he was absolutely sure he could keep quiet. Huck declared that they *had* to keep quiet. He warned that the malicious Injun Joe would drown them as easily as two cats if they leaked the secret and he wasn't hanged. Huck proposed that they should make a solemn vow to each other to remain silent, stating that this was necessary. Tom agreed, saying it was the best plan, and asked if they should just hold hands and swear.

He picked up a clean pine shingle that lay in the moon-light, took a little fragment of “red keel” out of his pocket, got the moon on his work, and painfully scrawled these lines, emphasizing each slow down-stroke by clamping his tongue between his teeth, and letting up the pressure on the up-strokes.\n“Huck Finn and Tom Sawyer swears they will keep mum about This and They wish They may Drop down dead in Their Tracks if They ever Tell and Rot.”\nHuckleberry was filled with admiration of Tom’s facility in writing, and the sublimity of his language.

He picked up a clean wooden shingle lying in the moonlight, took out a small piece of red chalk or crayon from his pocket, positioned the shingle under the moonlight to see, and with great effort, slowly wrote out the lines. He emphasized each careful downward stroke by biting his tongue and releasing the pressure on the upward ones. The inscription read: \"Huck Finn and Tom Sawyer swear they will keep quiet about This, and they wish they would fall down dead instantly if they ever speak of it, and rot.\" Huckleberry was deeply impressed by Tom's skill at writing and the powerful language of the oath.

It might have verdigris on it.\" When Huck asked what verdigris was, Tom replied, \"It's poison. That's what it is. Just swallow some sometime—you'll see.\" So, Tom unwound the thread from one of his needles, and each boy pricked the pad of their thumb, squeezing out a drop of blood.

Huck started to take a pin to prick his finger, but Tom stopped him, warning that a brass pin might have poisonous verdigris on it. Tom then took the thread off his own needle, and each boy pricked his thumb, squeezing out a drop of blood. After a few tries, Tom managed to sign his initials by using his finger as a pen, then showed Huck how to write ‘H’ and ‘F’. With that, their blood pact was done.

A bloody knife had been discovered near the victim, and someone identified it as belonging to Muff Potter, or so people said. Rumor had it that a late-night passerby saw Potter washing himself in the creek around one or two in the morning, and that he left the scene stealthily—suspicious behavior, especially since Potter was not known for cleanliness. People also claimed that the town had thoroughly searched for this 'murderer' (since the public is quick to judge), but he was nowhere to be found. Riders had set off on all roads searching for him, and the Sheriff was sure that Potter would be caught before the day ended."

He no longer took an interest in war, nor even in piracy. The charm of life was gone; there was nothing but dreariness left. He put his hoop away, and his bat; there was no joy in them any more.

All the “rot” they contained about ventilation, and how to go to bed, and how to get up, and what to eat, and what to drink, and how much exercise to take, and what frame of mind to keep one’s self in, and what sort of clothing to wear, was all gospel to her, and she never observed that her health-journals of the current month customarily upset everything they had recommended the month before. She was as simple-hearted and honest as the day was long, and so she was an easy victim.

What did make him act so?”\n“Deed I don’t know, Aunt Polly; cats always act so when they’re having a good time.”\n“They do, do they?” There was something in the tone that made Tom apprehensive.\n“Yes’m. That is, I believe they do.”\n“You do?”\n“Yes’m.”\nThe old lady was bending down, Tom watching, with interest emphasized by anxiety. Too late he divined her “drift.” The handle of the telltale tea-spoon was visible under the bed-valance. Aunt Polly took it, held it up. Tom winced, and dropped his eyes. Aunt Polly raised him by the usual handle—his ear—and cracked his head soundly with her thimble.\n“Now, sir, what did you want to treat that poor dumb beast so, for?”\n“I done it out of pity for him—because he hadn’t any aunt.”\n“Hadn’t any aunt!—you numskull. What has that got to do with it?”\n“Heaps. Because if he’d had one she’d a burnt him out herself! She’d a roasted his bowels out of him ’thout any more feeling than if he was a human!”\nAunt Polly felt a sudden pang of remorse. This was putting the thing in a new light; what was cruelty to a cat might be cruelty to a boy, too. She began to soften; she felt sorry. Her eyes watered a little, and she put her hand on Tom’s head and said gently:\n“I was meaning for the best, Tom. And, Tom, it did do you good.”\nTom looked up in her face with just a perceptible twinkle peeping through his gravity.\n“I know you was meaning for the best, aunty, and so was I with Peter. It done him good, too. I never see him get around so since—”\n“Oh, go ’long with you, Tom, before you aggravate me again.

Or at least, I think they do.” “You think so?” “Yes’m.” The older woman was bending down, and Tom watched, his interest heightened by worry. He finally understood what she was searching for, but it was too late. The handle of the revealing teaspoon was sticking out from under the bed skirt. Aunt Polly picked it up and held it high. Tom winced and looked down. Aunt Polly lifted him by his ear, her usual method, and gave his head a solid rap with her thimble. “Now, young man, why did you feel the need to treat that poor, speechless creature in such a way?” “I did it out of compassion for him—because he didn’t have an aunt.” “Didn’t have an aunt!—You simpleton. What does that have anything to do with it?” “Loads. Because if he’d had one, she would have tormented him herself! She would have tortured him brutally without any more feeling than if he were a person!” Aunt Polly felt a sudden pang of guilt. This explained things differently; perhaps what was cruel to a cat could also be cruel to a boy. She began to soften, feeling regretful. Her eyes became slightly moist, and she placed her hand on Tom’s head, saying gently: “I was trying to do what was best, Tom. And, Tom, it really did help you.” Tom looked up at her face, a faint sparkle of mischief appearing despite his serious expression. “I know you were trying to do what was best, Aunty, and I was too with Peter. It helped him a lot too. I’ve never seen him move around so much since—” “Oh, leave it be, Tom, before you annoy me again.

At least, I think they do.\"\n\"You do?\"\n\"Yes, ma’am.\"\nAunt Polly bent down while Tom watched, worried. He realized her intention too late. She pulled a tea-spoon out from under the bed, and Tom dropped his gaze, knowing he’d been caught. Aunt Polly grabbed him by the ear and tapped his head smartly with her thimble.\n\"Now, sir, why did you treat that poor animal like that?\"\n\"I did it because I felt sorry for him—he doesn’t have an aunt.\"\n\"No aunt? You silly boy! What does that have to do with anything?\"\n\"A lot. If he had one, she would’ve burned him out, just like that. She would’ve cooked his insides out without a second thought, just like she would with a person!\"\nAunt Polly suddenly felt guilty. She looked at the situation differently—maybe being harsh to a cat was as bad as being harsh to a child. Her eyes moistened as she became gentler and placed her hand on Tom’s head.\n\"I was only doing it for your own good, Tom. And it did help you.\"\nTom looked up at her with a faint glimmer of mischief in his serious expression.\n\"I know you meant well, Aunt Polly, and so did I with Peter. It did him good, too.

And now, as usual of late, he hung about the gate of the schoolyard instead of playing with his comrades. He was sick, he said, and he looked it. He tried to seem to be looking everywhere but whither he really was looking—down the road. Presently Jeff Thatcher hove in sight, and Tom’s face lighted; he gazed a moment, and then turned sorrowfully away. When Jeff arrived, Tom accosted him; and “led up” warily to opportunities for remark about Becky, but the giddy lad never could see the bait. Tom watched and watched, hoping whenever a frisking frock came in sight, and hating the owner of it as soon as he saw she was not the right one. At last frocks ceased to appear, and he dropped hopelessly into the dumps; he entered the empty schoolhouse and sat down to suffer. Then one more frock passed in at the gate, and Tom’s heart gave a great bound. The next instant he was out, and “going on” like an Indian; yelling, laughing, chasing boys, jumping over the fence at risk of life and limb, throwing handsprings, standing on his head—doing all the heroic things he could conceive of, and keeping a furtive eye out, all the while, to see if Becky Thatcher was noticing. But she seemed to be unconscious of it all; she never looked. Could it be possible that she was not aware that he was there? He carried his exploits to her immediate vicinity; came war-whooping around, snatched a boy’s cap, hurled it to the roof of the schoolhouse, broke through a group of boys, tumbling them in every direction, and fell sprawling, himself, under Becky’s nose, almost upsetting her—and she turned, with her nose in the air, and he heard her say: “Mf! some people think they’re mighty smart—always showing off!”\nTom’s cheeks burned.

Tom approached Jeff and cautiously attempted to guide the conversation towards Becky, but the oblivious boy didn't pick up on his hints. Tom kept up his anxious vigil by the gate, hoping to see a girl arrive and feeling disappointed with each one who wasn't Becky. Eventually, no more girls appeared, and he became utterly despondent. He went into the deserted schoolhouse and sat down, feeling miserable. Just then, one more girl passed through the gate, and Tom's heart soared. He immediately ran out, behaving wildly and loudly. He yelled, laughed, chased boys, recklessly jumped the fence, did handsprings, and stood on his head – performing all the daring feats he could, while constantly trying to see if Becky Thatcher noticed. However, she seemed completely unaware and never looked his way. Could it be possible she didn't know he was there? He took his antics right near her, approaching with war cries, grabbing a boy's hat and throwing it onto the school roof, scattering a group of boys, and deliberately falling right in front of Becky, almost knocking her over. She turned away disdainfully, and he heard her mutter, \"Humph! Some people think they're so smart – always showing off!\" Tom's cheeks flushed with shame.

Tom anxiously watched every girl who passed by, feeling disappointed every time he saw it wasn’t Becky.

Immediately, he ran outside, making a display of wild and daring stunts—yelling, laughing, doing tricks, and keeping an eye on Becky Thatcher to see if she noticed. But Becky didn’t seem to pay attention, never even glancing his way. Wondering if she even realized he was there, Tom performed his antics closer to her, loudly grabbing a boy's cap and tossing it on the roof, breaking up a group of boys before stumbling at Becky’s feet and almost knocking into her.

Some people think they’re really clever—always showing off!” Embarrassed, Tom blushed, picked himself up, and snuck away feeling defeated and humiliated."

It was but a small strain on his imagination to remove Jackson’s Island beyond eye-shot of the village, and so he “looked his last” with a broken and satisfied heart. The other pirates were looking their last, too; and they all looked so long that they came near letting the current drift them out of the range of the island.

A few faint lights marked its location, as it lay peacefully asleep beyond the vast, star-speckled water, completely unaware of the momentous event occurring.

He wished 'she' could see him now, imagining himself at sea, bravely facing danger and death with courage, heading towards his fate with a stern look. He easily imagined Jackson's Island far enough away from the village to be out of sight, allowing him to perform this 'last look' with a mix of sadness and satisfaction. The other 'pirates' were also casting their final glances. They watched for so long that the current nearly carried them past the island. However, they realized the danger in time and managed to change direction to prevent it. Around two o'clock in the morning, the raft grounded on a sandbar about two hundred yards upstream from the top of the island.

The Black Avenger stood motionless with his arms crossed, taking one final look at the place of his past happiness and pain, wishing that \"she\" could see him now—venturing bravely into the unknown, facing danger and possible death with courage, and confronting his fate with a determined smile. It was easy for him to pretend that Jackson’s Island was far beyond the sight of the town, so he took his farewell of the old place with a mix of sadness and contentment.

He had finished gouging out a cob, and now he fitted a weed stem to it, loaded it with tobacco, and was pressing a coal to the charge and blowing a cloud of fragrant smoke—he was in the full bloom of luxurious contentment. The other pirates envied him this majestic vice, and secretly resolved to acquire it shortly. Presently Huck said:\n“What does pirates have to do?”\nTom said:\n“Oh, they have just a bully time—take ships and burn them, and get the money and bury it in awful places in their island where there’s ghosts and things to watch it, and kill everybody in the ships—make ’em walk a plank.”\n“And they carry the women to the island,” said Joe; “they don’t kill the women.”\n“No,” assented Tom, “they don’t kill the women—they’re too noble. And the women’s always beautiful, too.”\n“And don’t they wear the bulliest clothes! Oh no! All gold and silver and di’monds,” said Joe, with enthusiasm.\n“Who?” said Huck.\n“Why, the pirates.”\nHuck scanned his own clothing forlornly.\n“I reckon I ain’t dressed fitten for a pirate,” said he, with a regretful pathos in his voice; “but I ain’t got none but these.”\nBut the other boys told him the fine clothes would come fast enough, after they should have begun their adventures. They made him understand that his poor rags would do to begin with, though it was customary for wealthy pirates to start with a proper wardrobe.\nGradually their talk died out and drowsiness began to steal upon the eyelids of the little waifs. The pipe dropped from the fingers of the Red-Handed, and he slept the sleep of the conscience-free and the weary. The Terror of the Seas and the Black Avenger of the Spanish Main had more difficulty in getting to sleep. They said their prayers inwardly, and lying down, since there was nobody there with authority to make them kneel and recite aloud; in truth, they had a mind not to say them at all, but they were afraid to proceed to such lengths as that, lest they might call down a sudden and special thunderbolt from heaven. Then at once they reached and hovered upon the imminent verge of sleep—but an intruder came, now, that would not “down.” It was conscience. They began to feel a vague fear that they had been doing wrong to run away; and next they thought of the stolen meat, and then the real torture came. They tried to argue it away by reminding conscience that they had purloined sweetmeats and apples scores of times; but conscience was not to be appeased by such thin plausibilities; it seemed to them, in the end, that there was no getting around the stubborn fact that taking sweetmeats was only “hooking,” while taking bacon and hams and such valuables was plain simple stealing—and there was a command against that in the Bible. So they inwardly resolved that so long as they remained in the business, their piracies should not again be sullied with the crime of stealing. Then conscience granted a truce, and these curiously inconsistent pirates fell peacefully to sleep.",
          "paraphrase_gemini-2.5-flash-preview-04-17": "The character called the Red-Handed, otherwise occupied, did not respond. He had just finished creating a tobacco pipe from a corn cob, fitted a weed stem to it, filled it with tobacco, and was now applying a hot ember to the contents, inhaling a cloud of fragrant smoke. He was clearly enjoying a moment of profound satisfaction. The other boys playing pirates were envious of this grand indulgence and decided they would soon take up smoking too. Shortly after, Huck inquired, “What do pirates actually do?” Tom replied, “Oh, they live wonderfully – they capture and burn ships, seize money, and hide it in terrible, haunted places on their islands where ghosts guard it. They kill everyone on the ships, forcing them to walk the plank.” Joe added, “And they bring the women back to the island; they don’t kill the women.” Tom confirmed, “Right, they spare the women – they are too honorable for that. And the women are always stunningly beautiful as well.” Joe, full of excitement, chimed in, “And their clothes are incredible! Absolutely! All gold, silver, and diamonds!” “Who are we talking about?” asked Huck. “Why, the pirates,” Joe answered. Huck glanced down sadly at his own clothes. “I guess I’m not dressed appropriately to be a pirate,” he said, with a trace of sadness in his voice, “but these are all I have.” However, the other boys assured him that acquiring fancy clothes would happen quickly once they started their adventures. They explained that his poor attire was fine for starting out, although wealthy pirates typically began with a proper, elaborate wardrobe. Gradually, their conversation faded, and the young runaways began to feel sleepy. The pipe slipped from the Red-Handed’s grasp, and he fell into a deep, peaceful sleep, untroubled by guilt. The Terror of the Seas and the Black Avenger of the Spanish Main found it harder to drift off. They silently said their prayers, lying down since there was no one present to make them kneel and speak them aloud. Truthfully, they almost skipped praying entirely, but they were too scared to go that far, fearing a sudden act of divine punishment like a thunderbolt. Just as they were on the verge of sleep, something intruded that they couldn't push away: their conscience. They started feeling a faint worry that running away was wrong. Then they thought about the meat they had taken, and this brought genuine distress. They tried to soothe their conscience by reminding it they had taken candy and apples many times before; but such weak arguments didn't satisfy their inner voice. Ultimately, they felt they couldn't escape the harsh truth that taking sweet treats was just 'borrowing,' while taking bacon, ham, and other valuable items was clearly simple stealing – and the Bible explicitly forbade that. So, they inwardly promised that as long as they continued their piracy, they would not stain it with the crime of theft again. With this resolution, conscience granted them a break, and these strangely contradictory pirates finally fell asleep peacefully.",
          "paraphrase_gpt-4.1-2025-04-14": "The Red-Handed didn't answer, being preoccupied. He had finished carving a corncob, attached a weed stem to it, filled it with tobacco, lit it, and was now enjoying blowing out sweet-smelling smoke—completely content. The other pirates watched him with envy, wishing they too could enjoy such a dignified habit and secretly deciding they would soon learn how. After a while, Huck asked, \"What do pirates actually do?\" Tom responded, \"Oh, they have great fun—seize ships, set them on fire, take the money, and hide it in scary places on their islands, guarded by ghosts and such, and kill everyone on the ships—make them walk the plank.\" Joe added, \"But they take the women to the island—they don’t kill the women.\" Tom agreed, \"No, they don’t hurt the women—they’re too honorable for that. And the women are always beautiful, too.\" Joe continued excitedly, \"And don’t pirates have the best clothes? Covered with gold, silver, and diamonds.\" \"Who does?\" asked Huck. \"The pirates, of course,\" Joe answered. Huck looked at his own clothes sadly and said, \"I guess I’m not dressed right to be a pirate,\" in a sorrowful tone. \"But these are all I have.\" The other boys reassured him that once they began their adventures, fine clothes would come quickly. For now, his ragged clothes were acceptable, but wealthy pirates usually started out with fancy outfits. Eventually, their talking faded, and they started to get sleepy. The Red-Handed let his pipe fall and slept soundly, free of worry. The Terror of the Seas and the Black Avenger of the Spanish Main took longer to fall asleep. They silently said their prayers since there was no one to make them kneel and say them aloud; they almost skipped praying altogether but feared a sudden punishment from heaven if they did. As they were about to fall asleep, guilt crept in—they felt uneasy for running away, then remembered the meat they had stolen, which troubled them even more. They tried to justify it by reminding themselves they'd taken candies and apples before, but their conscience wasn't satisfied; they realized that stealing meat was real theft, not just harmless mischief, and that there was a Biblical commandment against it. So, they silently promised that from now on, even as pirates, they wouldn’t steal again. Their conscience then let them rest, and these amusingly inconsistent young pirates finally drifted off to sleep."

          "text_segment": "Now, far away in the woods a bird called; another answered; presently the hammering of a woodpecker was heard. Gradually the cool dim gray of the morning whitened, and as gradually sounds multiplied and life manifested itself. The marvel of Nature shaking off sleep and going to work unfolded itself to the musing boy. A little green worm came crawling over a dewy leaf, lifting two-thirds of his body into the air from time to time and “sniffing around,” then proceeding again—for he was measuring, Tom said; and when the worm approached him, of its own accord, he sat as still as a stone, with his hopes rising and falling, by turns, as the creature still came toward him or seemed inclined to go elsewhere; and when at last it considered a painful moment with its curved body in the air and then came decisively down upon Tom’s leg and began a journey over him, his whole heart was glad—for that meant that he was going to have a new suit of clothes—without the shadow of a doubt a gaudy piratical uniform. Now a procession of ants appeared, from nowhere in particular, and went about their labors; one struggled manfully by with a dead spider five times as big as itself in its arms, and lugged it straight up a tree-trunk. A brown spotted lady-bug climbed the dizzy height of a grass blade, and Tom bent down close to it and said, “Lady-bug, lady-bug, fly away home, your house is on fire, your children’s alone,” and she took wing and went off to see about it—which did not surprise the boy, for he knew of old that this insect was credulous about conflagrations, and he had practised upon its simplicity more than once. A tumblebug came next, heaving sturdily at its ball, and Tom touched the creature, to see it shut its legs against its body and pretend to be dead. The birds were fairly rioting by this time. A catbird, the Northern mocker, lit in a tree over Tom’s head, and trilled out her imitations of her neighbors in a rapture of enjoyment; then a shrill jay swept down, a flash of blue flame, and stopped on a twig almost within the boy’s reach, cocked his head to one side and eyed the strangers with a consuming curiosity; a gray squirrel and a big fellow of the “fox” kind came skurrying along, sitting up at intervals to inspect and chatter at the boys, for the wild things had probably never seen a human being before and scarcely knew whether to be afraid or not. All Nature was wide awake and stirring, now; long lances of sunlight pierced down through the dense foliage far and near, and a few butterflies came fluttering upon the scene.",
          "paraphrase_gemini-2.5-flash-preview-04-17": "In the distance, the call of one bird was heard, followed by another's response; then came the sound of a woodpecker tapping. Gradually, the cool, dim morning light brightened, and sounds and signs of life grew more numerous. The young boy, lost in thought, watched the incredible spectacle of Nature shaking off sleep and starting its daily activities. A small green caterpillar inched across a dew-covered leaf, periodically lifting the front two-thirds of its body into the air to 'sense its surroundings' before moving on – it was measuring, Tom decided. When the caterpillar deliberately approached him, he remained perfectly still, his hopes fluctuating as the creature either continued towards him or seemed about to turn away. Finally, after a brief, tense pause with its body arched in the air, it came down firmly onto Tom's leg and began to move across him. His heart swelled with joy, for this meant, without a doubt, he was destined for a new outfit – probably a colorful pirate costume. Next, a line of ants appeared from no obvious starting point and went about their work; one struggled bravely, hauling a dead spider five times its own size straight up a tree trunk. A brown-spotted ladybug scaled the considerable height of a blade of grass. Tom leaned close and recited, \"Ladybug, ladybug, fly away home, your house is on fire, your children's alone.\" The ladybug immediately flew off to investigate, which didn't surprise the boy, as he knew from past experience that this insect was easily tricked by tales of fires, and he had exploited its gullibility before. A tumblebug arrived next, diligently pushing its ball, and Tom touched it, prompting the creature to draw its legs tight against its body and feign death. By this time, the birds were quite boisterous. A catbird, known for mimicking others, landed in a tree above Tom and merrily sang its imitations of nearby birds. Then a sharp-voiced jay, a flash of bright blue, swooped down and perched on a branch nearly within the boy's reach, tilting its head and watching the intruders with intense curiosity. A gray squirrel and a large 'fox' squirrel scampered by, occasionally pausing to sit up, observe, and chatter at the boys, as the wild animals had likely never encountered humans before and were uncertain whether to be scared or not. All of nature was now fully awake and active; long beams of sunlight sliced through the thick leaves near and far, and a few butterflies fluttered into the scene.",
          "paraphrase_gpt-4.1-2025-04-14": "In the woods, distant birds began to call to each other, and soon the tapping of a woodpecker echoed through the trees. As morning slowly brightened, more and more sounds filled the air, bringing the forest to life before Tom’s thoughtful gaze. He noticed a tiny green worm crawling along a wet leaf, sometimes stretching a large part of its body upward, seemingly investigating its surroundings. Tom imagined the worm was measuring something. When the worm finally made its way onto Tom's leg and crawled over him, Tom was delighted, believing it meant he would soon get new clothes—a fancy, pirate-like outfit. Next, ants appeared, busy at work; one was hauling a large dead spider up a tree all by itself. A brown, spotted ladybug climbed to the top of a grass blade, and Tom recited a rhyming plea for it to fly home. The ladybug flew away, as Tom expected, because he knew from experience they believed such warnings. Then a diligent dung beetle rolled its ball by, and when Tom touched it, the beetle curled up and pretended to be dead. By now, birds filled the woods with their lively calls. A catbird, known for its mimicry, perched above Tom and sang imitations of other birds, while a bright blue jay darted down nearby, eyeing the boys curiously. A gray squirrel and a large fox squirrel scampered through, stopping at times to watch and chatter, perhaps confused by the sight of humans. The forest was now fully awake; beams of sunlight shone through the leaves, and butterflies began to flutter around."

They took a swim about every hour, so it was close upon the middle of the afternoon when they got back to camp.

The stillness, the solemnity that brooded in the woods, and the sense of loneliness, began to tell upon the spirits of the boys. They fell to thinking. A sort of undefined longing crept upon them.

Instead, they enjoyed a meal of cold ham before stretching out in the shade to chat. However, conversation soon dwindled and stopped. The quiet, the serious mood of the forest, and the feeling of isolation began to affect them. The boys started thinking deeply, feeling an undefined longing that slowly developed into homesickness. Even Huck, known as Finn the Red-Handed, found himself missing his own doorstep and empty barrels. Still, none of them admitted their feelings, as each was too embarrassed to speak up."

Presently a revealing thought flashed through Tom’s mind, and he exclaimed:\n“Boys, I know who’s drownded—it’s us!”\nThey felt like heroes in an instant. Here was a gorgeous triumph; they were missed; they were mourned; hearts were breaking on their account; tears were being shed; accusing memories of unkindness to these poor lost lads were rising up, and unavailing regrets and remorse were being indulged; and best of all, the departed were the talk of the whole town, and the envy of all the boys, as far as this dazzling notoriety was concerned.

Maybe they’re just saying it to themselves. They must be.

Suddenly, an idea struck Tom, and he shouted, \"Guys, I know who drowned—it’s us!\"\nInstantly, they felt heroic.

He swam quartering upstream, but still was swept downward rather faster than he had expected. However, he reached the shore finally, and drifted along till he found a low place and drew himself out. He put his hand on his jacket pocket, found his piece of bark safe, and then struck through the woods, following the shore, with streaming garments. Shortly before ten o’clock he came out into an open place opposite the village, and saw the ferryboat lying in the shadow of the trees and the high bank. Everything was quiet under the blinking stars. He crept down the bank, watching with all his eyes, slipped into the water, swam three or four strokes and climbed into the skiff that did “yawl” duty at the boat’s stern. He laid himself down under the thwarts and waited, panting.\nPresently the cracked bell tapped and a voice gave the order to “cast off.” A minute or two later the skiff’s head was standing high up, against the boat’s swell, and the voyage was begun. Tom felt happy in his success, for he knew it was the boat’s last trip for the night. At the end of a long twelve or fifteen minutes the wheels stopped, and Tom slipped overboard and swam ashore in the dusk, landing fifty yards downstream, out of danger of possible stragglers.",

He swam at an angle against the current, but was still carried downstream faster than he anticipated. Eventually, he reached the bank, drifting a short distance until he found a spot low enough to pull himself out. He checked his jacket pocket, confirmed his piece of bark was secure, and then made his way through the woods along the shore, his clothes dripping wet. Just before ten o'clock, he emerged into an open area across from the village. He spotted the ferryboat moored in the shadow of the trees and the tall bank. Everything was quiet under the softly shining stars. He carefully crept down the bank, watching intently, slipped into the water, swam a few strokes, and climbed into the small boat used as a yawl at the back of the ferry. He lay down beneath the seats and waited, out of breath. Soon after, a cracked bell rang and a voice ordered the lines to be untied. A couple of minutes later, the small boat was riding high on the ferry's wake, and their trip began. Tom felt pleased with his achievement, knowing this was the boat's final journey for the night. After a period lasting about twelve to fifteen minutes, the paddle wheels stopped.

With his clothes soaking wet, he started to walk through the woods along the riverbank. Just before ten o'clock, he emerged from the trees to a clearing across from the village, spotting the ferryboat resting in the shadows under the trees and the high riverbank.

Tom then crept out, stood by her bedside shading the candle, and watched her with pity. He took out a sycamore scroll to leave for her, but after thinking for a moment, decided to keep it. Smiling at his idea, he put the bark away, bent down to kiss her gently, and then carefully slipped out, closing the door behind him."

They were perfectly round white things a trifle smaller than an English walnut. They had a famous fried-egg feast that night, and another on Friday morning.\nAfter breakfast they went whooping and prancing out on the bar, and chased each other round and round, shedding clothes as they went, until they were naked, and then continued the frolic far away up the shoal water of the bar, against the stiff current, which latter tripped their legs from under them from time to time and greatly increased the fun. And now and then they stooped in a group and splashed water in each other’s faces with their palms, gradually approaching each other, with averted faces to avoid the strangling sprays, and finally gripping and struggling till the best man ducked his neighbor, and then they all went under in a tangle of white legs and arms and came up blowing, sputtering, laughing, and gasping for breath at one and the same time.\nWhen they were well exhausted, they would run out and sprawl on the dry, hot sand, and lie there and cover themselves up with it, and by and by break for the water again and go through the original performance once more. Finally it occurred to them that their naked skin represented flesh-colored “tights” very fairly; so they drew a ring in the sand and had a circus—with three clowns in it, for none would yield this proudest post to his neighbor.\nNext they got their marbles and played “knucks” and “ringtaw” and “keeps” till that amusement grew stale. Then Joe and Huck had another swim, but Tom would not venture, because he found that in kicking off his trousers he had kicked his string of rattlesnake rattles off his ankle, and he wondered how he had escaped cramp so long without the protection of this mysterious charm. He did not venture again until he had found it, and by that time the other boys were tired and ready to rest.

After breakfast, they excitedly ran and jumped onto the sandbar, shedding their clothes as they chased each other until they were naked. They continued their playful activities further out in the shallow water against the strong current, which occasionally knocked their legs out from under them, making the game more entertaining. Every so often, they would gather and splash water in each other's faces with their hands, slowly moving closer, their faces turned away to avoid the stinging spray, until they finally grappled and wrestled until one person managed to dunk another. They would then all plunge underwater together in a jumble of limbs, resurfacing simultaneously, sputtering, laughing, and struggling for air. Once thoroughly exhausted, they would run to the warm, dry sand, lie down, bury themselves in it, and later return to the water to repeat their games. Eventually, they thought their naked bodies resembled flesh-colored 'tights' quite well, so they drew a circle in the sand and held a circus with three clowns, as no one was willing to let another have this coveted role. Afterward, they played marbles, including 'knucks,' 'ringtaw,' and 'keeps,' until they grew tired of it.

Huck was melancholy, too. Tom was downhearted, but tried hard not to show it. He had a secret which he was not ready to tell, yet, but if this mutinous depression was not broken up soon, he would have to bring it out. He said, with a great show of cheerfulness:\n“I bet there’s been pirates on this island before, boys. We’ll explore it again. They’ve hid treasures here somewhere. How’d you feel to light on a rotten chest full of gold and silver—hey?”\nBut it roused only faint enthusiasm, which faded out, with no reply. Tom tried one or two other seductions; but they failed, too. It was discouraging work. Joe sat poking up the sand with a stick and looking very gloomy. Finally he said:\n“Oh, boys, let’s give it up. I want to go home. It’s so lonesome.”\n“Oh no, Joe, you’ll feel better by and by,” said Tom. “Just think of the fishing that’s here.”\n“I don’t care for fishing. I want to go home.”\n“But, Joe, there ain’t such another swimming-place anywhere.”\n“Swimming’s no good. I don’t seem to care for it, somehow, when there ain’t anybody to say I sha’n’t go in. I mean to go home.”\n“Oh, shucks! Baby! You want to see your mother, I reckon.”\n“Yes, I do want to see my mother—and you would, too, if you had one. I ain’t any more baby than you are.” And Joe snuffled a little.\n“Well, we’ll let the crybaby go home to his mother, won’t we, Huck? Poor thing—does it want to see its mother? And so it shall. You like it here, don’t you, Huck? We’ll stay, won’t we?”\nHuck said, “Y-e-s”—without any heart in it.\n“I’ll never speak to you again as long as I live,” said Joe, rising. “There now!” And he moved moodily away and began to dress himself.\n“Who cares!” said Tom. “Nobody wants you to. Go ’long home and get laughed at. Oh, you’re a nice pirate. Huck and me ain’t crybabies. We’ll stay, won’t we, Huck? Let him go if he wants to. I reckon we can get along without him, per’aps.”\nBut Tom was uneasy, nevertheless, and was alarmed to see Joe go sullenly on with his dressing. And then it was discomforting to see Huck eying Joe’s preparations so wistfully, and keeping up such an ominous silence. Presently, without a parting word, Joe began to wade off toward the Illinois shore. Tom’s heart began to sink. He glanced at Huck. Huck could not bear the look, and dropped his eyes. Then he said:\n“I want to go, too, Tom. It was getting so lonesome anyway, and now it’ll be worse. Let’s us go, too, Tom.”\n“I won’t! You can all go, if you want to. I mean to stay.”\n“Tom, I better go.”\n“Well, go ’long—who’s hendering you.”\nHuck began to pick up his scattered clothes. He said:\n“Tom, I wisht you’d come, too. Now you think it over. We’ll wait for you when we get to shore.”\n“Well, you’ll wait a blame long time, that’s all.”\nHuck started sorrowfully away, and Tom stood looking after him, with a strong desire tugging at his heart to yield his pride and go along too. He hoped the boys would stop, but they still waded slowly on. It suddenly dawned on Tom that it was become very lonely and still. He made one final struggle with his pride, and then darted after his comrades, yelling:\n“Wait! Wait! I want to tell you something!”\nThey presently stopped and turned around. When he got to where they were, he began unfolding his secret, and they listened moodily till at last they saw the “point” he was driving at, and then they set up a warwhoop of applause and said it was “splendid!” and said if he had told them at first, they wouldn’t have started away. He made a plausible excuse; but his real reason had been the fear that not even the secret would keep them with him any very great length of time, and so he had meant to hold it in reserve as a last seduction.",

Tom, though equally sad, tried hard not to show it. He held onto a secret he wasn't ready to share yet, but he knew he'd have to reveal it soon if the gloomy mood persisted. Putting on a cheerful act, he suggested, “I bet pirates have been on this island before, guys. Let’s explore again. They must have hidden treasure here somewhere. How would you feel if we found a rotten chest full of gold and silver?”  However, this idea sparked only a weak, fleeting bit of excitement that quickly vanished without a response. Tom attempted a couple more enticing suggestions, but they also failed. It was discouraging. Joe sat poking the sand with a stick, looking utterly dejected. Finally, he said, “Oh, guys, let’s just give up. I want to go home. It’s so lonely here.” Tom replied, “Oh no, Joe, you’ll feel better in a while. Just think about how great the fishing is here.” “I don’t care about fishing. I want to go home.” “But, Joe, there’s no other place with swimming like this.” “Swimming’s not fun. I just don’t feel like it when there’s no one to tell me I can’t swim. I’m going home.” “Oh, come on! Baby! You miss your mother, I guess.” “Yes, I *do* miss my mother – and you would too if you had one. I’m no more a baby than you are.” Joe teared up slightly. Tom taunted, “Well, we’ll let the little crybaby go home to his mommy, won’t we, Huck? Poor thing – does it want its mother? And so it shall. You like it here, don’t you, Huck? We’ll stay, right?” Huck responded listlessly, “Y-e-s.” Joe declared, standing up, “I’m never speaking to you again as long as I live! There!” He turned away moodily and started getting dressed. Tom retorted, “Who cares! Nobody wants you to. Go on home and be laughed at. Oh, you’re a great pirate. Huck and I aren’t crybabies. We’re staying, right, Huck? Let him go if he wants. We can probably get along without him.” Despite his words, Tom felt uneasy and alarmed as he watched Joe sullenly continue dressing. It was also unsettling to see Huck watching Joe’s preparations so longingly, maintaining a tense silence. Soon, without a word, Joe began wading away towards the shore of Illinois. Tom’s spirits sank. He glanced at Huck, who couldn't meet his eyes and looked away. Then Huck said, “I want to go too, Tom. It was already getting lonely, and now it’ll be worse. Let’s both go, Tom.” “I won’t! You can all go if you want to. I intend to stay.” “Tom, I really should go.” “Fine, go ahead – no one’s stopping you.” Huck began gathering his scattered clothes, saying, “Tom, I wish you’d come too. Think about it. We’ll wait for you when we get to shore.” “Well, you’ll be waiting for a ridiculously long time, that’s for sure.” Huck sadly started to leave, and Tom watched him go, feeling a strong urge to swallow his pride and follow. He hoped the boys would stop, but they kept wading slowly on. It suddenly hit Tom how very quiet and lonely it had become. He wrestled with his pride one last time, then sprinted after them, shouting, “Wait! Wait! I need to tell you something!” They stopped and turned around. When he reached them, he began sharing his secret, and they listened gloomily until they finally understood what he was getting at. Then they burst into enthusiastic cheers and called it “splendid!” adding that if he had told them sooner, they wouldn’t have started to leave. He gave a plausible excuse, but his real reason was the fear that even the secret wouldn't keep them with him for long, so he had planned to keep it back as a final enticement.",
          "paraphrase_gpt-4.1-2025-04-14": "Joe was so discouraged his spirits were nearly beyond repair. He missed home badly and struggled with his sorrow, often close to tears. Huck also felt sad. Tom was feeling low but hid it, keeping a secret he hadn’t shared yet; if their mood didn’t improve, he’d have to reveal it. Trying to lift everyone’s spirits, Tom feigned cheer and suggested there must be pirates’ treasure hidden on the island, but the others showed little interest. Tom tried other ideas but nothing worked. Joe, dejected, fiddled with a stick in the sand, eventually asking to give up and go home because he felt so lonely. Tom tried to persuade him to stay, mentioning fishing and swimming, but Joe still wanted to leave, saying there was no thrill without someone to forbid him. Tom teased Joe for wanting his mother. Joe admitted it—challenging Tom by saying he’d feel the same if he had a mother—and became upset. Tom continued to taunt, suggesting Huck and he would remain. Huck agreed without conviction. Joe, upset, got dressed and left for the shore. Tom pretended not to mind, but was bothered to see Huck watching Joe longingly. Before long, Huck confided he also wanted to go home. Tom insisted they could go if they wished—he would stay. Huck gathered his things and told Tom to think it over, offering to wait for him at the shore. Tom retorted he wouldn’t come, but as Huck walked away, Tom felt increasingly lonely. Finally, unable to stand it, he ran after them, calling for them to wait. When he caught up, he revealed his secret, which greatly cheered the others, who wished he had told them sooner; Tom’s real reason for the secrecy, though, was the worry that even his secret might not persuade them to stay for long, so he’d intended to save it for last."

          "text_segment": "The lads came gayly back and went at their sports again with a will, chattering all the time about Tom’s stupendous plan and admiring the genius of it. After a dainty egg and fish dinner, Tom said he wanted to learn to smoke, now. Joe caught at the idea and said he would like to try, too. So Huck made pipes and filled them. These novices had never smoked anything before but cigars made of grapevine, and they “bit” the tongue, and were not considered manly anyway.\nNow they stretched themselves out on their elbows and began to puff, charily, and with slender confidence. The smoke had an unpleasant taste, and they gagged a little, but Tom said:\n“Why, it’s just as easy! If I’d a knowed this was all, I’d a learnt long ago.”\n“So would I,” said Joe. “It’s just nothing.”\n“Why, many a time I’ve looked at people smoking, and thought well I wish I could do that; but I never thought I could,” said Tom.\n“That’s just the way with me, hain’t it, Huck? You’ve heard me talk just that way—haven’t you, Huck? I’ll leave it to Huck if I haven’t.”\n“Yes—heaps of times,” said Huck.\n“Well, I have too,” said Tom; “oh, hundreds of times. Once down by the slaughter-house. Don’t you remember, Huck? Bob Tanner was there, and Johnny Miller, and Jeff Thatcher, when I said it. Don’t you remember, Huck, ’bout me saying that?”\n“Yes, that’s so,” said Huck. “That was the day after I lost a white alley. No, ’twas the day before.”\n“There—I told you so,” said Tom. “Huck recollects it.”\n“I bleeve I could smoke this pipe all day,” said Joe. “I don’t feel sick.”\n“Neither do I,” said Tom. “I could smoke it all day. But I bet you Jeff Thatcher couldn’t.”\n“Jeff Thatcher! Why, he’d keel over just with two draws. Just let him try it once. He’d see!”\n“I bet he would. And Johnny Miller—I wish could see Johnny Miller tackle it once.”\n“Oh, don’t I!” said Joe. “Why, I bet you Johnny Miller couldn’t any more do this than nothing. Just one little snifter would fetch him.”\n“’Deed it would, Joe. Say—I wish the boys could see us now.”\n“So do I.”\n“Say—boys, don’t say anything about it, and some time when they’re around, I’ll come up to you and say, ‘Joe, got a pipe? I want a smoke.’ And you’ll say, kind of careless like, as if it warn’t anything, you’ll say, ‘Yes, I got my old pipe, and another one, but my tobacker ain’t very good.’ And I’ll say, ‘Oh, that’s all right, if it’s strong enough.’ And then you’ll out with the pipes, and we’ll light up just as ca’m, and then just see ’em look!”\n“By jings, that’ll be gay, Tom! I wish it was now!”\n“So do I! And when we tell ’em we learned when we was off pirating, won’t they wish they’d been along?”\n“Oh, I reckon not! I’ll just bet they will!”\nSo the talk ran on. But presently it began to flag a trifle, and grow disjointed. The silences widened; the expectoration marvellously increased. Every pore inside the boys’ cheeks became a spouting fountain; they could scarcely bail out the cellars under their tongues fast enough to prevent an inundation; little overflowings down their throats occurred in spite of all they could do, and sudden retchings followed every time. Both boys were looking very pale and miserable, now. Joe’s pipe dropped from his nerveless fingers. Tom’s followed. Both fountains were going furiously and both pumps bailing with might and main. Joe said feebly:\n“I’ve lost my knife. I reckon I better go and find it.”\nTom said, with quivering lips and halting utterance:\n“I’ll help you. You go over that way and I’ll hunt around by the spring. No, you needn’t come, Huck—we can find it.”\nSo Huck sat down again, and waited an hour. Then he found it lonesome, and went to find his comrades. They were wide apart in the woods, both very pale, both fast asleep. But something informed him that if they had had any trouble they had got rid of it.\nThey were not talkative at supper that night.",
          "paraphrase_gemini-2.5-flash-preview-04-17": "The boys returned happily and immediately resumed their activities with energy, excitedly discussing Tom's ingenious plan and admiring his cleverness. After enjoying a meal of eggs and fish, Tom announced he wanted to learn to smoke, and Joe eagerly agreed to try it with him. Huck prepared pipes and filled them. Up to this point, their only smoking experience had been with cigars made from grapevine, which were unpleasant and not considered proper for boys. They carefully reclined on their elbows and cautiously began to puff, lacking much confidence. The smoke tasted unpleasant, and they experienced some discomfort and gagging. Despite this, Tom declared, 'Wow, this is simple! If I had known it was this easy, I would have learned a long time ago.' Joe echoed his sentiment, saying, 'Me too. It's nothing difficult at all.' Tom reminisced about watching others smoke and wishing he could, never believing he'd be able to. He challenged Huck to confirm he had often expressed this wish. Huck readily agreed, stating he had heard Tom say it many times. Tom added that he had thought about it hundreds of times, recalling a specific instance near the slaughterhouse with Bob Tanner, Johnny Miller, and Jeff Thatcher present. Huck confirmed the memory, tying it to the day he lost or found a white alley marble. Tom pointed out that Huck's recollection proved his point. Joe claimed he felt fine and could smoke the pipe all day. Tom agreed, also saying he could smoke all day, but confidently predicted that Jeff Thatcher couldn't handle it, suggesting Thatcher would quickly feel sick. They agreed that Johnny Miller would also be unable to smoke, predicting even a small puff would make him ill. They wished their friends could see them now and planned to show off their new skill casually later. Tom proposed approaching Joe while others were around, asking for a pipe to smoke as if it were a normal habit. Joe would then offer a pipe, mentioning the tobacco wasn't great, and Tom would accept it if it was 'strong' enough. They would then calmly light up and watch everyone's reaction. Joe excitedly exclaimed how fun that would be and wished they could do it immediately. Tom agreed and speculated how their friends would envy them when they learned they acquired this skill while 'pirating.' The conversation continued in this manner, but soon became less lively and more fragmented. The pauses grew longer, and they started spitting excessively. Their mouths produced a surprising amount of saliva, and they struggled to swallow it fast enough, leading to occasional small amounts going down their throats and causing sudden urges to throw up. Both boys looked noticeably pale and unwell. Joe's pipe fell from his shaky hand, and Tom's soon followed. Both were now producing a lot of saliva and trying desperately to control it. Feebly, Joe said he had lost his knife and needed to go find it. Tom, with trembling lips and hesitant speech, offered to help, suggesting they search separately, and told Huck he didn't need to join them. Huck remained seated and waited for an hour. Feeling lonely, he went to find them. He found them spread far apart in the woods, both very pale and sound asleep. However, he sensed that whatever difficulty they had faced was now over. They were quiet during supper that evening.",

After enjoying a nice meal of eggs and fish, Tom announced he wanted to learn how to smoke. Joe was eager to join in, so Huck made some pipes and filled them. Since none of them had smoked anything beyond grapevine cigars before—which tasted harsh and weren’t thought of as proper—they approached the real pipes with caution. They lay down, propped on their elbows, and started puffing uncertainly. The smoke tasted bad, and they choked a bit before Tom declared it was easy and that he wished he’d learned sooner. Joe agreed, saying it was no big deal. Tom reminisced about watching others smoke and wanting to try, asking Huck if he remembered, and Huck confirmed he did. They boasted that they could smoke all day, asserting that others like Jeff Thatcher or Johnny Miller couldn’t handle it. The boys imagined how impressed everyone would be if they saw them smoking and planned to show off the next time they were together. Eventually, their conversation petered out, and they started to feel sick, spitting more and more and trying to manage their discomfort. Soon, Joe dropped his pipe, followed by Tom, both feeling pale and miserable. Joe said he’d lost his knife and suggested searching for it, with Tom offering to help, leaving Huck behind. After an hour, Huck went to look for them and found both boys fast asleep in different parts of the woods, looking unwell but seemingly past their troubles. That night, they weren’t very talkative at dinner."

Then a faint moan came sighing through the branches of the forest and the boys felt a fleeting breath upon their cheeks, and shuddered with the fancy that the Spirit of the Night had gone by. There was a pause. Now a weird flash turned night into day and showed every little grassblade, separate and distinct, that grew about their feet. And it showed three white, startled faces, too.

A furious blast roared through the trees, making everything sing as it went. One blinding flash after another came, and peal on peal of deafening thunder. And now a drenching rain poured down and the rising hurricane drove it in sheets along the ground. The boys cried out to each other, but the roaring wind and the booming thunderblasts drowned their voices utterly. However, one by one they straggled in at last and took shelter under the tent, cold, scared, and streaming with water; but to have company in misery seemed something to be grateful for. They could not talk, the old sail flapped so furiously, even if the other noises would have allowed them. The tempest rose higher and higher, and presently the sail tore loose from its fastenings and went winging away on the blast. The boys seized each others’ hands and fled, with many tumblings and bruises, to the shelter of a great oak that stood upon the riverbank. Now the battle was at its highest. Under the ceaseless conflagration of lightning that flamed in the skies, everything below stood out in cleancut and shadowless distinctness: the bending trees, the billowy river, white with foam, the driving spray of spumeflakes, the dim outlines of the high bluffs on the other side, glimpsed through the drifting cloudrack and the slanting veil of rain. Every little while some giant tree yielded the fight and fell crashing through the younger growth; and the unflagging thunderpeals came now in ear-splitting explosive bursts, keen and sharp, and unspeakably appalling. The storm culminated in one matchless effort that seemed likely to tear the island to pieces, burn it up, drown it to the treetops, blow it away, and deafen every creature in it, all at one and the same moment. It was a wild night for homeless young heads to be out in.\nBut at last the battle was done, and the forces retired with weaker and weaker threatenings and grumblings, and peace resumed her sway. The boys went back to camp, a good deal awed; but they found there was still something to be thankful for, because the great sycamore, the shelter of their beds, was a ruin, now, blasted by the lightnings, and they were not under it when the catastrophe happened.\nEverything in camp was drenched, the campfire as well; for they were but heedless lads, like their generation, and had made no provision against rain. Here was matter for dismay, for they were soaked through and chilled. They were eloquent in their distress; but they presently discovered that the fire had eaten so far up under the great log it had been built against (where it curved upward and separated itself from the ground), that a handbreadth or so of it had escaped wetting; so they patiently wrought until, with shreds and bark gathered from the under sides of sheltered logs, they coaxed the fire to burn again. Then they piled on great dead boughs till they had a roaring furnace, and were gladhearted once more. They dried their boiled ham and had a feast, and after that they sat by the fire and expanded and glorified their midnight adventure until morning, for there was not a dry spot to sleep on, anywhere around.",

The sky was filled with repeated bright flashes of lightning, followed by incredibly loud claps of thunder. Then, heavy rain began to fall, and the strengthening wind whipped it across the ground. The boys tried to call out to one another, but the noise of the wind and thunder completely overwhelmed their shouts. Eventually, they managed to find their way to the tent, arriving one by one. They huddled beneath it, cold, frightened, and soaked. However, they felt some relief simply from being together in their distress. They couldn't speak, partly because the old tent fabric was flapping violently in the wind, and partly because of the storm's noise. The storm continued to grow more intense. Soon, the tent fabric ripped free from its ties and was carried away by the wind. The boys grabbed hold of each other and ran, stumbling and getting bruised, towards a large oak tree by the riverbank for protection. The storm was now at its most violent. The constant flashes of lightning illuminated everything below with sharp, distinct clarity, leaving no shadows: the trees bending in the wind, the river swelling and covered in white foam, the flying mist and spray, and the faint shapes of the tall cliffs across the river, seen through gaps in the moving clouds and the falling rain. Periodically, a large tree would be overcome by the wind and fall noisily through the smaller trees. The thunder continued without pause, now sounding like incredibly loud, sharp explosions that were terrifying. The storm reached its peak with a single, incredibly powerful surge that felt strong enough to destroy the island by ripping it apart, setting it on fire, flooding it completely, blowing it away, and deafening everything on it, all simultaneously. It was a dangerous night for young boys to be without shelter. Eventually, the storm's fury subsided. Its power lessened, and the sounds of thunder and wind became weaker, gradually giving way to calm. The boys returned to their campsite, feeling deeply impressed and humbled by what they had experienced. However, they realized they had reason to be thankful because the large sycamore tree where they slept had been destroyed by lightning, and they had been safely away from it when it happened. Everything at the camp was completely soaked, including their campfire. They had been careless boys, typical of their age, and hadn't prepared for rain. This situation was disheartening, as they were soaked and shivering. They expressed their misery clearly, but then they noticed that the fire had burned underneath the large log they had placed it against (where the log curved up off the ground), and a small part of the fire had stayed dry. So, they worked patiently, gathering dry material like bark and small pieces from the undersides of logs protected from the rain, until they managed to get the fire going again. They then added large dry branches to the flames until they had a powerful, roaring fire, which lifted their spirits. They dried their cooked ham and ate a meal. Afterward, they sat by the fire, spending the time until morning elaborating on and exaggerating the details of their night's adventure, since there wasn't a dry place to sleep anywhere nearby.",
          "paraphrase_gpt-4.1-2025-04-14": "\"Hurry, boys, to the tent!\" Tom shouted. The boys dashed off in different directions, tripping over roots and pushing through tangled vines in the darkness. A fierce wind whipped through the forest, making a loud, eerie noise. Lightning flashed repetitively, and thunder boomed so loudly that they couldn't hear each other’s shouts. Then came a heavy, pouring rain, swept by the increasing storm. Eventually, the boys managed to find their way to the tent, shivering, frightened, and soaked through, but at least comforted to be together. Conversation was impossible with the violent flapping of the old sail and the continuing roar of the storm. Soon, the sail ripped free and was carried away by the wind. Grabbing each other's hands, the boys ran—stumbling and getting bruised—to take refuge under a huge oak tree by the river. At this point, the storm was at its wildest. Flash after flash of lightning lit up the whole landscape starkly: the bent trees, the foaming river, sprays of water, and distant bluffs faintly visible through the slanting rain and drifting clouds. Occasionally a massive tree crashed down amid the younger ones, and the thunder exploded louder and sharper than ever. The storm reached a terrifying peak, as if it would tear the island apart, set it on fire, flood it, blow it away, and deafen all at once—a terrible night to be without shelter. Finally, the storm lessened, rumbling weakly as peace returned. The boys went back to their campsite, awestruck, and found something to be grateful for: the big sycamore tree that sheltered their beds had been destroyed by lightning, but they had not been under it when it happened. Everything was soaked, including the fire, because, like careless boys, they hadn’t prepared for rain. They were dismayed, cold, and wet. But then they found a small bit of fire still burning under the shelter of the large log, just dry enough to reignite with some dry bark they gathered. Soon they had a big fire going again, dried off their food, and had a satisfying meal. Afterward, they sat around the fire, reliving and exaggerating their adventure through the storm until morning, since there was nowhere dry to sleep."

They got scorched out by and by, and drearily set about getting breakfast. After the meal they felt rusty, and stiff-jointed, and a little homesick once more. Tom saw the signs, and fell to cheering up the pirates as well as he could. But they cared nothing for marbles, or circus, or swimming, or anything. He reminded them of the imposing secret, and raised a ray of cheer. While it lasted, he got them interested in a new device. This was to knock off being pirates, for a while, and be Indians for a change. They were attracted by this idea; so it was not long before they were stripped, and striped from head to heel with black mud, like so many zebras—all of them chiefs, of course—and then they went tearing through the woods to attack an English settlement.\nBy and by they separated into three hostile tribes, and darted upon each other from ambush with dreadful warwhoops, and killed and scalped each other by thousands. It was a gory day. Consequently it was an extremely satisfactory one.\nThey assembled in camp toward suppertime, hungry and happy; but now a difficulty arose—hostile Indians could not break the bread of hospitality together without first making peace, and this was a simple impossibility without smoking a pipe of peace. There was no other process that ever they had heard of. Two of the savages almost wished they had remained pirates. However, there was no other way; so with such show of cheerfulness as they could muster they called for the pipe and took their whiff as it passed, in due form.\nAnd behold, they were glad they had gone into savagery, for they had gained something; they found that they could now smoke a little without having to go and hunt for a lost knife; they did not get sick enough to be seriously uncomfortable. They were not likely to fool away this high promise for lack of effort. No, they practised cautiously, after supper, with right fair success, and so they spent a jubilant evening. They were prouder and happier in their new acquirement than they would have been in the scalping and skinning of the Six Nations.

The sun eventually became too hot, forcing them up to grudgingly prepare breakfast. After eating, they felt uncomfortable, stiff, and a bit homesick again. Recognizing their mood, Tom did his best to lift the pirates' spirits. However, they showed no interest in games, circuses, swimming, or anything else. He brought up the important secret they shared, which offered a brief moment of cheer. During this time, he successfully introduced a new idea. This involved temporarily giving up being pirates to become Indians instead. The concept appealed to them; consequently, they were soon stripped naked and covered in black mud stripes from head to foot, resembling zebras—each one a chief, naturally—before rushing through the woods pretending to attack an English settlement. Eventually, they split into three opposing tribes and sprang from hiding at each other with terrifying war cries, enacting battles where they 'killed' and 'scalped' thousands. It was a bloody affair, which meant it was an extremely satisfying one. They gathered back at their camp near suppertime, hungry and content. However, a problem arose—enemy Indian tribes couldn't share a meal in peace without first performing a peace ceremony, and this was impossible without smoking a pipe of peace. They knew of no other method. Two of the boys almost regretted not staying pirates. Still, there was no alternative; so, displaying as much cheerfulness as they could manage, they requested the pipe and took their turns puffing from it according to custom. To their surprise, they were pleased they had become savages, for they had gained something; they discovered they could now smoke a little without having to search for a lost knife; they did not get sick enough to be seriously uncomfortable. They were determined not to waste this promising development due to lack of effort. Indeed, they practised cautiously after supper with quite good results, and so they spent a joyful evening. They were prouder and happier about this new skill than they would have been from scalping and skinning the Six Nations.

Eventually, the heat woke them up, and they wearily went about making breakfast. After eating, they felt sore, stiff, and once again a bit homesick. Noticing this, Tom tried to lift everyone’s spirits, but none of them were interested in games, swimming, or the circus. He reminded them of their important secret, which cheered them up for a while. Seizing the moment, Tom suggested they stop pretending to be pirates and become Indians instead. The idea excited everyone, and soon they were covered in black mud stripes from head to toe, acting as chiefs, and ran through the woods planning to attack an imaginary English settlement. Before long, they split into three rival groups, ambushing each other with loud war cries, pretending to battle and scalp each other in an exciting and bloody game—a day that felt highly enjoyable to them. When evening came, they regrouped at their camp feeling hungry and pleased, but faced a challenge: as enemy tribes, they couldn’t share food without making peace, which required smoking a peace pipe. Although two of them kind of wished they’d stayed pirates, they saw no other choice, so they called for the pipe and took their turn smoking. They were happy with their new skill, as they could now smoke a bit without having to look for a lost knife or getting very sick. They practiced carefully after supper and had a joyful evening, feeling prouder of learning to smoke than if they had actually conquered powerful tribes. We will leave them here, happily smoking, talking, and boasting, as we have no more to say about them for now."

Come!”\nTom pressed his fingers on his forehead an anxious minute, and then said:\n“I’ve got it now! I’ve got it now! It blowed the candle!”\n“Mercy on us! Go on, Tom—go on!”\n“And it seems to me that you said, ‘Why, I believe that that door—’”\n“Go on, Tom!”\n“Just let me study a moment—just a moment. Oh, yes—you said you believed the door was open.”\n“As I’m sitting here, I did! Didn’t I, Mary! Go on!”\n“And then—and then—well I won’t be certain, but it seems like as if you made Sid go and—and—”\n“Well? Well? What did I make him do, Tom? What did I make him do?”\n“You made him—you—Oh, you made him shut it.”\n“Well, for the land’s sake! I never heard the beat of that in all my days! Don’t tell me there ain’t anything in dreams, any more. Sereny Harper shall know of this before I’m an hour older. I’d like to see her get around this with her rubbage ’bout superstition. Go on, Tom!”\n“Oh, it’s all getting just as bright as day, now. Next you said I warn’t bad, only mischeevous and harum-scarum, and not any more responsible than—than—I think it was a colt, or something.”\n“And so it was! Well, goodness gracious! Go on, Tom!”\n“And then you began to cry.”\n“So I did. So I did. Not the first time, neither. And then—”\n“Then Mrs. Harper she began to cry, and said Joe was just the same, and she wished she hadn’t whipped him for taking cream when she’d throwed it out her own self—”\n“Tom! The sperrit was upon you! You was a prophesying—that’s what you was doing! Land alive, go on, Tom!”\n“Then Sid he said—he said—”\n“I don’t think I said anything,” said Sid.\n“Yes you did, Sid,” said Mary.\n“Shut your heads and let Tom go on! What did he say, Tom?”\n“He said—I think he said he hoped I was better off where I was gone to, but if I’d been better sometimes—”\n“There, d’you hear that! It was his very words!”\n“And you shut him up sharp.”\n“I lay I did! There must ’a’ been an angel there. There was an angel there, somewheres!”\n“And Mrs. Harper told about Joe scaring her with a firecracker, and you told about Peter and the Pain-killer—”\n“Just as true as I live!”\n“And then there was a whole lot of talk ’bout dragging the river for us, and ’bout having the funeral Sunday, and then you and old Miss Harper hugged and cried, and she went.”\n“It happened just so! It happened just so, as sure as I’m a-sitting in these very tracks. Tom, you couldn’t told it more like if you’d ’a’ seen it! And then what? Go on, Tom!”\n“Then I thought you prayed for me—and I could see you and hear every word you said. And you went to bed, and I was so sorry that I took and wrote on a piece of sycamore bark, ‘We ain’t dead—we are only off being pirates,’ and put it on the table by the candle; and then you looked so good, laying there asleep, that I thought I went and leaned over and kissed you on the lips.”\n“Did you, Tom, did you! I just forgive you everything for that!” And she seized the boy in a crushing embrace that made him feel like the guiltiest of villains.",

That counts for something, right?” “It doesn’t count for much—even a cat does that—but it’s better than nothing. What was your dream about?” “Well, on Wednesday night, I dreamt you were sitting there by the bed, Sid was by the woodbox, and Mary was next to him.” “Yes, we were. We always sit like that. I’m impressed your dreams managed to include even that small detail about us.” “And I dreamt Joe Harper’s mother was here.” “She was here!

The wind did blow something. Keep going!” Tom pressed his fingers against his forehead for an anxious moment, then announced, “I remember it now! I’ve got it! It blew out the candle!” “Bless my soul! Keep talking, Tom—tell me more!” “And I think you said, ‘I do believe that door—’” “Go on, Tom!” “Let me just think for a second—just a moment. Ah, yes—you said you thought the door was open.” “As I live and breathe, I did! Didn’t I, Mary! Go on!” “And then—and then—well, I’m not completely sure, but it seemed like you made Sid go and—and…” “Well? Well? What did I make him do, Tom? What did I make him do?” “You made him—you—oh, you made him close it.” “Well, I’ll be! I’ve never heard anything so uncanny in my whole life! Don’t ever tell me dreams mean nothing again. Sereny Harper will hear about this within the hour. I’d like to see her dismiss this with her nonsense about superstition. Keep going, Tom!” “Oh, it’s all becoming perfectly clear now. Next, you said I wasn’t bad, just mischievous and wild, and no more responsible than—than—I think it was a young horse or something.” “And that’s exactly what I said! Goodness gracious! Go on, Tom!” “And then you started crying.” “Yes, I did. I did. It wasn’t the first time, either. And then…” “Then Mrs. Harper started crying too and said Joe was just the same, and she regretted punishing him for taking cream when she was planning to throw it out herself—” “Tom! The spirit was speaking through you! You were prophesying—that’s what was happening! Good heavens, keep going, Tom!” “Then Sid said—he said…” “I don’t believe I said anything,” Sid interjected. “Yes, you did, Sid,” Mary confirmed. “Silence, both of you, and let Tom finish! What did he say, Tom?” “He said—I think he said he hoped I was in a better place where I’d gone, but if only I had been better sometimes…” “There, did you hear that! Those were his exact words!” “And you told him off sharply.” “You can bet I did! There must have been an angel there. An angel was definitely there, somewhere!” “And Mrs. Harper talked about Joe scaring her with a firecracker, and you talked about Peter and the Pain-killer—” “Absolutely true!” “And then there was a lot of discussion about searching the river for us and about having the funeral on Sunday. And then you and old Mrs. Harper hugged and cried, and she left.” “It happened precisely that way! Exactly that way, as sure as I’m sitting right here. Tom, you couldn’t have described it more accurately if you’d been watching! And then what? Go on, Tom!” “Then I thought you prayed for me—and I could see you and hear every single word you said.

Now that he was distinguished, maybe she would be wanting to “make up.” Well, let her—she should see that he could be as indifferent as some other people. Presently she arrived. Tom pretended not to see her. He moved away and joined a group of boys and girls and began to talk. Soon he observed that she was tripping gayly back and forth with flushed face and dancing eyes, pretending to be busy chasing schoolmates, and screaming with laughter when she made a capture; but he noticed that she always made her captures in his vicinity, and that she seemed to cast a conscious eye in his direction at such times, too. It gratified all the vicious vanity that was in him; and so, instead of winning him, it only “set him up” the more and made him the more diligent to avoid betraying that he knew she was about. Presently she gave over skylarking, and moved irresolutely about, sighing once or twice and glancing furtively and wistfully toward Tom. Then she observed that now Tom was talking more particularly to Amy Lawrence than to any one else. She felt a sharp pang and grew disturbed and uneasy at once. She tried to go away, but her feet were treacherous, and carried her to the group instead. She said to a girl almost at Tom’s elbow—with sham vivacity:\n“Why, Mary Austin! you bad girl, why didn’t you come to Sunday-school?”\n“I did come—didn’t you see me?”\n“Why, no! Did you? Where did you sit?”\n“I was in Miss Peters’ class, where I always go. I saw you.”\n“Did you? Why, it’s funny I didn’t see you. I wanted to tell you about the picnic.”\n“Oh, that’s jolly. Who’s going to give it?”\n“My ma’s going to let me have one.”\n“Oh, goody; I hope she’ll let me come.”\n“Well, she will. The picnic’s for me. She’ll let anybody come that I want, and I want you.”\n“That’s ever so nice. When is it going to be?”\n“By and by. Maybe about vacation.”\n“Oh, won’t it be fun! You going to have all the girls and boys?”\n“Yes, every one that’s friends to me—or wants to be”; and she glanced ever so furtively at Tom, but he talked right along to Amy Lawrence about the terrible storm on the island, and how the lightning tore the great sycamore tree “all to flinders” while he was “standing within three feet of it.”\n“Oh, may I come?” said Grace Miller.\n“Yes.”\n“And me?” said Sally Rogers.\n“Yes.”\n“And me, too?” said Susy Harper. “And Joe?”\n“Yes.”\nAnd so on, with clapping of joyful hands till all the group had begged for invitations but Tom and Amy. Then Tom turned coolly away, still talking, and took Amy with him. Becky’s lips trembled and the tears came to her eyes; she hid these signs with a forced gayety and went on chattering, but the life had gone out of the picnic, now, and out of everything else; she got away as soon as she could and hid herself and had what her sex call “a good cry.” Then she sat moody, with wounded pride, till the bell rang. She roused up, now, with a vindictive cast in her eye, and gave her plaited tails a shake and said she knew what she’d do.",

Now that he was celebrated, perhaps she would want to mend their relationship. Well, he would let her, but she would see that he could be just as unconcerned as anyone else. Soon, she arrived. Tom pretended not to see her. He walked off and joined a gathering of boys and girls, beginning to talk. Before long, he noticed her cheerfully skipping back and forth, her face flushed and eyes sparkling, pretending to chase classmates and laughing loudly when she caught them. However, he observed that she always caught them near where he was standing, and that she seemed to purposefully look his way at those moments. This pleased all the cruel self-importance within him; consequently, instead of attracting him, it only puffed him up further and made him more careful not to show that he was aware of her presence. Eventually, she stopped her playful antics and moved around hesitantly, sighing once or twice and glancing secretly and longingly towards Tom. Then she saw that Tom was currently talking more specifically to Amy Lawrence than to anyone else. She felt a sharp pain and became instantly troubled and anxious. She tried to leave, but her feet seemed to betray her, carrying her towards the group instead. She spoke to a girl standing very close to Tom, with false cheerfulness: \"Why, Mary Austin! You naughty child, why didn't you attend Sunday school?\" \"I did attend—didn't you see me?\" \"Why, no! You did? Where did you sit?\" \"I was in Miss Peters' class, where I always am. I saw you.\" \"You did? Well, it's strange I didn't see you. I wanted to tell you about the picnic.\" \"Oh, that sounds wonderful. Who is hosting it?\" \"My mother is going to let me have one.\" \"Oh, great; I hope she'll let me come.\" \"Yes, she will. The picnic is for me. She'll allow anyone I want to come, and I want you.\" \"That is so kind. When is it going to be?\" \"Soon. Perhaps around vacation.\" \"Oh, won't that be fun! Are you inviting all the girls and boys?\" \"Yes, everyone who is my friend—or wants to be\"; and she glanced very subtly at Tom, but he continued talking intently to Amy Lawrence about the terrible storm on the island, and how the lightning had ripped the large sycamore tree \"into splinters\" while he was \"standing only three feet away.\" \"Oh, can I come?\" asked Grace Miller. \"Yes.\" \"And me?\" asked Sally Rogers. \"Yes.\" \"And me, too?\" asked Susy Harper. \"And Joe?\" \"Yes.\" And so it went, with joyful clapping of hands, until everyone in the group except Tom and Amy had requested invitations. Then Tom calmly turned away, still talking, and took Amy with him. Becky's lips trembled, and tears welled up in her eyes; she hid these signs with forced cheerfulness and continued chattering, but all the joy had gone out of the picnic, and out of everything else, for her. She got away as soon as she could, hid herself, and had what her sex calls \"a good cry.\" Afterward, she sat feeling moody and with hurt pride until the bell rang. She stood up then, with a vengeful look in her eyes, shook her braided pigtails, and declared she knew what she would do.",

Now that he was important, maybe Becky would want to reconcile. If she did, Tom would show her that he could be just as uncaring as anyone else. Soon Becky appeared, but Tom acted as if he didn’t notice her, moving over to talk with a group of other boys and girls. He saw that Becky was laughing loudly and running around pretending to chase classmates, but she always ended up near him, giving him sneaky glances. This satisfied Tom’s pride, making him even more determined not to let on that he’d noticed her. Becky stopped playing, wandered nearby looking sad, and glanced at Tom. She noticed that Tom seemed more interested in talking to Amy Lawrence. Becky felt hurt and anxious, wanting to leave but unable to keep herself from joining the group anyway. She cheerfully asked Mary Austin why she hadn’t come to Sunday-school, and the two girls talked excitedly about a picnic Becky’s mother was planning. Other children eagerly asked if they could come, and Becky agreed they could. All the children asked to be invited except Tom and Amy. Tom coolly walked off with Amy, still keeping up his conversation. Becky’s lips quivered and she fought back tears, hiding her feelings with forced cheerfulness until she could escape to be alone and cry. She brooded with hurt pride until the school bell rang, then stood up with determination, angry resolve in her eyes, and thought to herself that she knew how she would respond."

At last he spied her, but there was a sudden falling of his mercury. She was sitting cosily on a little bench behind the schoolhouse looking at a picture-book with Alfred Temple—and so absorbed were they, and their heads so close together over the book, that they did not seem to be conscious of anything in the world besides. Jealousy ran red-hot through Tom’s veins. He began to hate himself for throwing away the chance Becky had offered for a reconciliation. He called himself a fool, and all the hard names he could think of. He wanted to cry with vexation. Amy chatted happily along, as they walked, for her heart was singing, but Tom’s tongue had lost its function. He did not hear what Amy was saying, and whenever she paused expectantly he could only stammer an awkward assent, which was as often misplaced as otherwise. He kept drifting to the rear of the schoolhouse, again and again, to sear his eyeballs with the hateful spectacle there. He could not help it. And it maddened him to see, as he thought he saw, that Becky Thatcher never once suspected that he was even in the land of the living. But she did see, nevertheless; and she knew she was winning her fight, too, and was glad to see him suffer as she had suffered.\nAmy’s happy prattle became intolerable. Tom hinted at things he had to attend to; things that must be done; and time was fleeting. But in vain—the girl chirped on. Tom thought, “Oh, hang her, ain’t I ever going to get rid of her?” At last he must be attending to those things—and she said artlessly that she would be “around” when school let out.

His purpose was to seek out Becky Thatcher and cause her pain by flaunting his actions. He finally located her, but his mood instantly darkened. She was comfortably seated on a small bench behind the school, sharing a picture book with Alfred Temple. They were so absorbed, their heads so close together over the pages, that they seemed completely unaware of anything else around them. Burning jealousy pulsed through Tom. He started hating himself for having thrown away the opportunity Becky had offered for a reconciliation. He called himself a fool and every other harsh name he could conjure up. He wanted to cry out of pure annoyance. Amy chattered cheerfully as they walked, her spirits high, but Tom was unable to speak. He didn't register what Amy was saying, and when she paused expectantly, he could only manage an awkward, stammered agreement that was usually inappropriate. He couldn't help repeatedly returning to the back of the schoolhouse, forcing himself to witness the painful sight there. It was unavoidable. And it drove him mad to believe, as he perceived it, that Becky Thatcher had no idea he was even alive. Yet, she did see him; and she knew she was gaining the upper hand, finding satisfaction in watching him suffer just as she had. Amy's joyful conversation grew intolerable. Tom alluded to having pressing matters to deal with, essential tasks that required immediate attention, stating time was running out. But it was futile – the girl kept chirping away. Tom thought, 'Oh, curse it, will I never be rid of her?' Eventually, he insisted he absolutely had to attend to those tasks, and she replied artlessly that she would be 'around' after school let out. He rushed away, filled with resentment towards her for saying that.",

Their closeness and focus on each other made it seem like nothing else in the world existed for them. Tom was overwhelmed with jealousy and began to regret wasting the chance Becky had given him to make up. He berated himself and wished he could cry out of frustration. While Amy chatted cheerfully as they walked, Tom barely paid attention to her, replying awkwardly whenever she expected a response. He repeatedly went behind the schoolhouse just to torment himself by watching Becky and Alfred together. To his dismay, Becky appeared not to notice him at all, which made his misery worse. However, Becky had seen him, knew she was winning their silent contest, and felt satisfied that Tom was suffering as she once did. Amy’s chatter soon became unbearable, so Tom made excuses to leave, but she kept talking, much to his annoyance. He thought desperately about how to get away from her, and finally told her he needed to do other things. She innocently replied that she’d see him after school, and Tom left in frustration, resenting her persistence."

Crying 'enough,' are you? Well, let that be a lesson to you!\" He finished this pretend beating feeling satisfied. Tom hurried home at noon. He couldn't stand Amy's happy gratitude any longer, and the sight of Becky with the other boy fueled his unbearable jealousy. Becky returned to looking at the pictures with Alfred, but as the minutes crawled by without Tom showing up to see her and presumably suffer, her initial triumph began to diminish, and she lost interest. Seriousness and distraction set in, followed by sadness. A couple of times, she perked up, listening intently at a sound of footsteps, but it was a false alarm; Tom never came. Eventually, she felt utterly miserable and wished she hadn't taken things so far. When the poor boy Alfred, sensing he was losing her attention without understanding why, kept trying to engage her by saying, \"Oh, here's a nice one! Look at this!\" she finally became impatient.

Tom adamantly swore he was telling the truth, claiming his only reason for coming was to prevent her from grieving. His aunt replied that she would give anything to believe him, as it would excuse a multitude of his wrongdoings, and she would almost be pleased he had run away and behaved so poorly. However, she found it illogical and asked why he hadn't told her sooner.

Tom identified it as the note he had written to inform her they had become pirates and expressed a genuine wish that she had woken up when he kissed her. The stern lines on his aunt's face softened, and a warm tenderness appeared in her eyes. She asked if he had kissed her, which he confirmed. She pressed him, asking if he was certain, and he repeatedly affirmed that he was.

His rod and his ferule were seldom idle now—at least among the smaller pupils. Only the biggest boys, and young ladies of eighteen and twenty, escaped lashing. Mr. Dobbins’ lashings were very vigorous ones, too; for although he carried, under his wig, a perfectly bald and shiny head, he had only reached middle age, and there was no sign of feebleness in his muscle. As the great day approached, all the tyranny that was in him came to the surface; he seemed to take a vindictive pleasure in punishing the least shortcomings.

At last they conspired together and hit upon a plan that promised a dazzling victory. They swore in the signpainter’s boy, told him the scheme, and asked his help. He had his own reasons for being delighted, for the master boarded in his father’s family and had given the boy ample cause to hate him. The master’s wife would go on a visit to the country in a few days, and there would be nothing to interfere with the plan; the master always prepared himself for great occasions by getting pretty well fuddled, and the signpainter’s boy said that when the dominie had reached the proper condition on Examination Evening he would “manage the thing” while he napped in his chair; then he would have him awakened at the right time and hurried away to school.",

He was happy to help, as he had good reasons to dislike the master, who boarded with his family and had given the boy plenty of cause for resentment.

All the rest of the house was filled with non-participating scholars.\nThe exercises began.

The rest of the room was filled with students not participating in the program. The performances began.

However, despite being extremely scared, he finished successfully and received enthusiastic applause after taking his prepared bow and exiting.

A very young boy shyly stood up and recited a poem that began, “You’d scarce expect one of my age to speak in public on the stage,” awkwardly copying the rigid gestures he had rehearsed, as if he were a malfunctioning machine. Although he was terribly nervous, he managed to finish and was rewarded with hearty applause after a stiff bow and quick exit.

The meagre Latin class recited with honor. The prime feature of the evening was in order, now—original “compositions” by the young ladies. Each in her turn stepped forward to the edge of the platform, cleared her throat, held up her manuscript (tied with dainty ribbon), and proceeded to read, with labored attention to “expression” and punctuation. The themes were the same that had been illuminated upon similar occasions by their mothers before them, their grandmothers, and doubtless all their ancestors in the female line clear back to the Crusades. “Friendship” was one; “Memories of Other Days”; “Religion in History”; “Dream Land”; “The Advantages of Culture”; “Forms of Political Government Compared and Contrasted”; “Melancholy”; “Filial Love”; “Heart Longings,” etc., etc.\nA prevalent feature in these compositions was a nursed and petted melancholy; another was a wasteful and opulent gush of “fine language”; another was a tendency to lug in by the ears particularly prized words and phrases until they were worn entirely out; and a peculiarity that conspicuously marked and marred them was the inveterate and intolerable sermon that wagged its crippled tail at the end of each and every one of them. No matter what the subject might be, a brainracking effort was made to squirm it into some aspect or other that the moral and religious mind could contemplate with edification. The glaring insincerity of these sermons was not sufficient to compass the banishment of the fashion from the schools, and it is not sufficient today; it never will be sufficient while the world stands, perhaps. There is no school in all our land where the young ladies do not feel obliged to close their compositions with a sermon; and you will find that the sermon of the most frivolous and the least religious girl in the school is always the longest and the most relentlessly pious.

Next came reading practice and a spelling competition. The small Latin group did well. The main part of the evening was now upon them—the original written pieces by the young women.

These included topics like “Friendship,” “Memories of Other Days,” “Religion in History,” “Dream Land,” “The Value of Culture,” “A Comparison of Political Systems,” “Melancholy,” “Love for Parents,” and “Inner Longings.” A common element in these compositions was a deliberate embrace of sadness; another was an excessive and elaborate use of ornate language; a third was a habit of repeatedly inserting pet words and phrases until they were completely overused; and a particularly obvious and detrimental trait was the persistent and irritating moral sermon that was tacked onto the end of every single one. Regardless of the composition’s initial subject, significant effort was made to twist it into some perspective that a moral and religious mind could find uplifting. The clear insincerity of these sermons was not enough to eliminate this trend from schools, and it isn't today either; perhaps it never will be enough while the world lasts. There isn't a school in our nation where the young women don’t feel compelled to finish their writings with a sermon; and you’ll find that the sermon by the most carefree and least religious girl in the school is consistently the longest and most intensely pious.

The small Latin class performed their recitations admirably. The highlight of the evening was the presentation of original essays by the young women. Each girl, in turn, approached the platform, prepared herself, unfurled her beautifully tied manuscript, and read her piece with careful attention to how she expressed herself and managed punctuation. The topics were familiar, the same sorts that had been given by their mothers, grandmothers, and likely by generations of women before them—subjects like “Friendship,” “Memories of Other Days,” “Religion in History,” “Dream Land,” “The Advantages of Culture,” “Comparisons of Political Systems,” “Melancholy,” “Filial Love,” “Heart Longings,” and so on. These writings usually featured a carefully cultivated sadness, an overabundance of ornate language, and a penchant for inserting favorite words and phrases until they became tedious. Most noticeably, every essay was inevitably capped with a moral sermon, awkwardly tacked onto the end. Regardless of the essay topic, great effort was made to shift its focus so it could produce some uplifting message for the moral or religious audience. Though these closing sermons were clearly insincere, they remained a steadfast custom in schools, resisting change even today and likely forever. There’s not a school anywhere where the girls don’t feel compelled to end their essays with such sermons, and ironically, the most superficial or least devout girl typically writes the longest and most overtly pious ending. But that’s enough on the subject; plain truth can be unpleasant."

Imagination is busy sketching rose-tinted pictures of joy. In fancy, the voluptuous votary of fashion sees herself amid the festive throng, ‘the observed of all observers.’ Her graceful form, arrayed in snowy robes, is whirling through the mazes of the joyous dance; her eye is brightest, her step is lightest in the gay assembly.\n“In such delicious fancies time quickly glides by, and the welcome hour arrives for her entrance into the Elysian world, of which she has had such bright dreams. How fairy-like does everything appear to her enchanted vision! Each new scene is more charming than the last. But after a while she finds that beneath this goodly exterior, all is vanity, the flattery which once charmed her soul, now grates harshly upon her ear; the ballroom has lost its charms; and with wasted health and imbittered heart, she turns away with the conviction that earthly pleasures cannot satisfy the longings of the soul!”\nAnd so forth and so on. There was a buzz of gratification from time to time during the reading, accompanied by whispered ejaculations of “How sweet!” “How eloquent!” “So true!” etc., and after the thing had closed with a peculiarly afflicting sermon the applause was enthusiastic.\nThen arose a slim, melancholy girl, whose face had the “interesting” paleness that comes of pills and indigestion, and read a “poem.” Two stanzas of it will do:\n“A MISSOURI MAIDEN’S FAREWELL TO ALABAMA\n“Alabama, goodbye! I love thee well!\n    But yet for a while do I leave thee now!\nSad, yes, sad thoughts of thee my heart doth swell,\n    And burning recollections throng my brow!\nFor I have wandered through thy flowery woods;\n    Have roamed and read near Tallapoosa’s stream;\nHave listened to Tallassee’s warring floods,\n    And wooed on Coosa’s side Aurora’s beam.\n\n“Yet shame I not to bear an o’erfull heart,\n    Nor blush to turn behind my tearful eyes;\n’Tis from no stranger land I now must part,\n    ’Tis to no strangers left I yield these sighs.\nWelcome and home were mine within this State,\n    Whose vales I leave—whose spires fade fast from me\nAnd cold must be mine eyes, and heart, and tête,\n    When, dear Alabama! they turn cold on thee!”\nThere were very few there who knew what “tête” meant, but the poem was very satisfactory, nevertheless.\nNext appeared a dark-complexioned, black-eyed, black-haired young lady, who paused an impressive moment, assumed a tragic expression, and began to read in a measured, solemn tone:\nDark and tempestuous was night. Around the throne on high not a single star quivered; but the deep intonations of the heavy thunder constantly vibrated upon the ear; whilst the terrific lightning revelled in angry mood through the cloudy chambers of heaven, seeming to scorn the power exerted over its terror by the illustrious Franklin! Even the boisterous winds unanimously came forth from their mystic homes, and blustered about as if to enhance by their aid the wildness of the scene.\nAt such a time, so dark, so dreary, for human sympathy my very spirit sighed; but instead thereof,\n ‘My dearest friend, my counsellor, my comforter and guide—\n        My joy in grief, my second bliss in joy,’ came to my side.\nShe moved like one of those bright beings pictured in the sunny walks of fancy’s Eden by the romantic and young, a queen of beauty unadorned save by her own transcendent loveliness. So soft was her step, it failed to make even a sound, and but for the magical thrill imparted by her genial touch, as other unobtrusive beauties, she would have glided away unperceived—unsought. A strange sadness rested upon her features, like icy tears upon the robe of December, as she pointed to the contending elements without, and bade me contemplate the two beings presented.\nThis nightmare occupied some ten pages of manuscript and wound up with a sermon so destructive of all hope to non-Presbyterians that it took the first prize. This composition was considered to be the very finest effort of the evening. The mayor of the village, in delivering the prize to the author of it, made a warm speech in which he said that it was by far the most “eloquent” thing he had ever listened to, and that Daniel Webster himself might well be proud of it.\nIt may be remarked, in passing, that the number of compositions in which the word “beauteous” was over-fondled, and human experience referred to as “life’s page,” was up to the usual average.",
          "paraphrase_gemini-2.5-flash-preview-04-17": "Let's turn back to the \"Examination.\" The initial composition presented was titled \"Is This, Then, Life?\" The reader might find an excerpt tolerable:\n\"In the usual routines of existence, how delightful are the feelings with which the youthful mind anticipates a future scene of celebration! Imagination is busy painting rosy visions of happiness. In her thoughts, the self-indulgent follower of fashion sees herself within the festive gathering, 'the object of everyone's attention.' Her elegant figure, dressed in pure white, is spinning through the intricate steps of the joyful dance; her eyes shine brightest, her movement is lightest in the cheerful assembly.\n\"In these pleasant daydreams, time swiftly flies by, and the awaited moment arrives for her entry into the heavenly realm she had such vivid dreams about. How magical everything appears to her captivated sight! Each new experience is more charming than the last. But after a while, she discovers that beneath this appealing surface, everything is pointless; the compliments that once thrilled her soul now sound harsh in her ears; the ballroom has lost its allure; and with health depleted and heart embittered, she turns away, convinced that worldly pleasures cannot satisfy the soul's deeper longings!\"\nAnd the piece continued in this vein. There was a murmur of approval from time to time during the reading, accompanied by whispered remarks like \"How sweet!\" \"How expressive!\" \"So accurate!\" etc., and after it concluded with a particularly depressing sermon, the applause was enthusiastic.\nNext, a slender, melancholic girl stood up; her face had the \"interesting\" paleness characteristic of taking medication and having indigestion. She read a \"poem.\" Two verses will be sufficient:\n\"A MISSOURI GIRL'S GOODBYE TO ALABAMA\n\"Alabama, farewell! I care for you deeply!\n    Yet I must leave you for a time now!\nSad, yes, sad thoughts of you make my heart ache,\n    And intense memories flood my mind!\nFor I have walked through your blooming forests;\n    Have roamed and read near the Tallapoosa's waters;\nHave heard the battling floods of Tallassee,\n    And courted the morning light by the Coosa's side.\n\n\"Still I am not ashamed to carry an overflowing heart,\n    Nor hesitate to look back with tearful eyes;\nIt is not from a foreign land I must now part,\n    It is not to strangers left behind that I express these sorrows.\nWelcome and home I found within this State,\n    Whose valleys I depart—whose towers quickly fade from my view—\nAnd my eyes, and heart, and head must be numb,\n    When, dear Alabama! they grow cold toward you!\"\nVery few of those present knew what \"tête\" meant, but the poem was quite pleasing nonetheless.\nAfter this came a young woman with a dark complexion, black eyes, and black hair. She paused for an impressive moment, adopted a sorrowful expression, and began to read in a slow, serious tone:\nThe night was dark and stormy. Near the high throne, not a single star flickered; but the deep tones of the heavy thunder constantly echoed, while the terrifying lightning raged angrily through the cloudy rooms of the sky, seeming to defy the control the famous Franklin had over its terror! Even the strong winds all together came forth from their hidden places and stormed about as if to increase the wildness of the scene with their help.\nIn such a dark, depressing time, my spirit yearned for human comfort; but instead of that,\n 'My closest companion, my guide, my solace and support—\n        My happiness in sorrow, my second joy in happiness,' came to my side.\nShe moved like one of those bright beings depicted in the sunny paths of an imagined paradise by romantic young people, a queen of beauty needing no adornment beyond her own exceptional loveliness. Her step was so soft it made no sound, and were it not for the magical feeling her warm touch imparted, she would have passed by unnoticed and unsought, like other subtle beauties. A peculiar sadness rested on her face, like frozen tears on a winter cloak, as she gestured towards the clashing elements outside and told me to consider the two individuals presented.\nThis lengthy and distressing piece was about ten pages of writing and concluded with a sermon so devoid of hope for anyone not Presbyterian that it secured the first prize. This composition was considered the absolute best work of the evening. The village mayor, in awarding the prize to its author, gave an enthusiastic speech, declaring it was by far the most \"eloquent\" thing he had ever heard and that Daniel Webster himself could well be proud of it.\nIt's worth mentioning, in passing, that the number of compositions where the word \"beauteous\" was overused and where life's experiences were referred to as \"life's page\" was about the usual amount.",
          "paraphrase_gpt-4.1-2025-04-14": "Let's go back to the \"Examination.\" The first work presented was an essay called “Is this, then, Life?” Here is a glimpse of it: It began by describing how young people eagerly look forward to celebrations, picturing delightful and beautiful events in their minds. The fashionable young woman sees herself admired at a party, elegantly dressed and dancing joyfully, the center of attention. Time seems to fly in these daydreams, and soon the real event arrives, looking just as magical as she imagined. Each moment feels even better than the last. But after a while, she discovers that beneath all the glamour, it's all empty. The compliments that once pleased her now annoy her, the fun is gone, and she comes to realize that earthly pleasures can't truly satisfy the heart. The audience found passages like these charming and whispered praises during the reading, and when it ended with a touching sermon, people applauded energetically."

But he made a sad business of it with his unsteady hand, and a smothered titter rippled over the house. He knew what the matter was, and set himself to right it. He sponged out lines and remade them; but he only distorted them more than ever, and the tittering was more pronounced. He threw his entire attention upon his work, now, as if determined not to be put down by the mirth. He felt that all eyes were fastened upon him; he imagined he was succeeding, and yet the tittering continued; it even manifestly increased. And well it might. There was a garret above, pierced with a scuttle over his head; and down through this scuttle came a cat, suspended around the haunches by a string; she had a rag tied about her head and jaws to keep her from mewing; as she slowly descended she curved upward and clawed at the string, she swung downward and clawed at the intangible air. The tittering rose higher and higher—the cat was within six inches of the absorbed teacher’s head—down, down, a little lower, and she grabbed his wig with her desperate claws, clung to it, and was snatched up into the garret in an instant with her trophy still in her possession! And how the light did blaze abroad from the master’s bald pate—for the signpainter’s boy had gilded it!\nThat broke up the meeting. The boys were avenged. Vacation had come.",

However, his shaky hand made a poor job of it, causing a wave of muffled giggles to spread through the room. He realized what was happening and set about correcting it. He erased the lines and redrew them, but only made the map look more misshapen than before, and the tittering became louder. He then focused intently on his work, as if determined not to be intimidated by the laughter. He sensed that everyone was watching him and thought he was doing well, yet the snickering continued and even noticeably increased. And there was good reason for it. There was an attic above, with a small opening directly over his head; from this opening, a cat was being lowered, suspended by a string tied around its hindquarters. A rag was tied around its head and mouth to keep it silent. As it slowly came down, it arched upwards, clawing at the string, then swung down, swiping at the empty air. The laughter rose higher and higher—the cat was now just six inches from the absorbed teacher's head—down, down, a little further, and it seized his wig with its desperate claws, clung fast, and was pulled up into the attic in an instant, its trophy still secured! And how brightly the light gleamed from the master's bald head—for the sign painter's helper had covered it in gold leaf! That incident ended the assembly. The boys had their revenge. Vacation had officially begun.",

However, his shaky hand made a poor drawing, causing quiet laughter to spread through the crowd. Realizing the problem, he tried to fix it by erasing and redrawing, but only made things worse, prompting even more laughter. Determined not to be distracted, he focused intently on his drawing, convinced he was improving it, yet the giggling only got louder. Unbeknownst to him, a cat was being lowered from the attic through an opening above his head, tied around the body with a string and its head and mouth wrapped to keep it quiet. The cat struggled, clawing at the string and the air as it descended, coming closer to the unsuspecting teacher's head. Finally, it grabbed onto his wig with its claws and was quickly pulled back up into the attic, taking the wig along. The room lit up with the shine from the teacher’s bald head, which had been painted with gold paint by the signpainter’s son. This hilarious incident abruptly ended the event, signaling the boys’ victory and the start of vacation."

Now he found out a new thing—namely, that to promise not to do a thing is the surest way in the world to make a body want to go and do that very thing. Tom soon found himself tormented with a desire to drink and swear; the desire grew to be so intense that nothing but the hope of a chance to display himself in his red sash kept him from withdrawing from the order. Fourth of July was coming; but he soon gave that up—gave it up before he had worn his shackles over forty-eight hours—and fixed his hopes upon old Judge Frazer, justice of the peace, who was apparently on his deathbed and would have a big public funeral, since he was so high an official. During three days Tom was deeply concerned about the Judge’s condition and hungry for news of it. Sometimes his hopes ran high—so high that he would venture to get out his regalia and practise before the looking-glass. But the Judge had a most discouraging way of fluctuating. At last he was pronounced upon the mend—and then convalescent. Tom was disgusted; and felt a sense of injury, too. He handed in his resignation at once—and that night the Judge suffered a relapse and died. Tom resolved that he would never trust a man like that again.\nThe funeral was a fine thing. The Cadets paraded in a style calculated to kill the late member with envy. Tom was a free boy again, however—there was something in that. He could drink and swear, now—but found to his surprise that he did not want to. The simple fact that he could, took the desire away, and the charm of it.",

As part of his membership, he committed to avoiding smoking, chewing tobacco, and swearing. He quickly discovered a strange phenomenon: the act of promising not to do something intensely increases the desire to do it. Tom soon found himself overwhelmingly wanting to drink and swear. This craving became so strong that only the anticipation of showcasing his red sash prevented him from quitting the group. Initially, he looked forward to the Fourth of July parade, but he abandoned that hope within two days of joining. Instead, he focused his aspirations on Justice of the Peace Judge Frazer, an important official who seemed close to death and likely to have a large public funeral. For three days, Tom anxiously awaited news about the Judge's health, eager for the potential funeral. At times, his optimism surged, leading him to take out his uniform and practice posing in front of the mirror. However, the Judge's health unpredictably improved. Eventually, he was declared recovering and then fully convalescent. Tom was dismayed and felt wronged by this turn of events. He immediately submitted his resignation. That very night, the Judge had a relapse and passed away. Tom vowed never to trust someone like the Judge again. The funeral turned out to be impressive, with the Cadets marching in a way that would have made the former member envious. Nevertheless, Tom was free again, which had its own value. He was now allowed to drink and swear, but to his surprise, he no longer wanted to. The simple fact that he could do these things eliminated the desire and their previous allure.",

As part of joining, he vowed not to smoke, chew tobacco, or use bad language while he was part of the group. However, Tom quickly discovered that making such promises only made him want to break them even more. He found himself desperately wanting to drink and swear, and it was only the idea of being able to wear his impressive sash that kept him in the group. With the Fourth of July coming up, he initially held out, but within two days he gave up on that and instead eagerly awaited the potential funeral of Judge Frazer, an important man who seemed near death — thinking the event would give him a chance to show off his regalia. For three days, Tom anxiously followed news about the Judge’s health, sometimes getting so hopeful he'd try on his uniform in front of the mirror. But the Judge’s health kept improving and then he recovered, which frustrated Tom. Feeling wronged, Tom quit the Cadets. Ironically, the Judge died that very night. The funeral turned out to be grand, with the Cadets' procession designed to make any former member envious. But Tom was now freed from his vows and could do as he pleased — yet, he was surprised to find that once he was allowed to drink and swear, he no longer wanted to. Simply knowing he could, removed their appeal."

Tom could not get away from it. Every reference to the murder sent a shudder to his heart, for his troubled conscience and fears almost persuaded him that these remarks were put forth in his hearing as “feelers”; he did not see how he could be suspected of knowing anything about the murder, but still he could not be comfortable in the midst of this gossip. It kept him in a cold shiver all the time. He took Huck to a lonely place to have a talk with him. It would be some relief to unseal his tongue for a little while; to divide his burden of distress with another sufferer. Moreover, he wanted to assure himself that Huck had remained discreet.\n“Huck, have you ever told anybody about—that?”\n“’Bout what?”\n“You know what.”\n“Oh—’course I haven’t.”\n“Never a word?”\n“Never a solitary word, so help me.

After a pause:\n“Huck, they couldn’t anybody get you to tell, could they?”\n“Get me to tell? Why, if I wanted that halfbreed devil to drownd me they could get me to tell. They ain’t no different way.”\n“Well, that’s all right, then. I reckon we’re safe as long as we keep mum. But let’s swear again, anyway. It’s more surer.”\n“I’m agreed.”\nSo they swore again with dread solemnities.",

Every mention of the murder sent a shiver through him, as his troubled conscience and fears almost convinced him that these remarks were being made in his presence as 'feelers' or attempts to gauge his knowledge. He couldn't grasp how he might be suspected of knowing anything about the crime, yet he couldn't relax surrounded by the gossip. It kept him in a state of constant anxiety. To relieve some of his distress by sharing the burden with the other person involved, and also to ensure Huck had kept their secret, he led Huck to a secluded spot for a talk. 'Huck, did you ever tell anyone about—that?' 'About what?' 'You know what I mean.' 'Oh—of course I haven’t.' 'Not a single word?' 'Not one solitary word, honest. Why do you ask?' 'Well, I was scared.' 'Tom Sawyer, if that got revealed, we wouldn’t last two days alive. You understand that.' Tom felt somewhat relieved. After a pause, he asked, 'Huck, nobody could ever force you to tell, could they?' 'Force me to tell? The only way they could make me tell is if they wanted that half-breed monster to drown me. There’s absolutely no other way.' 'Alright, that’s good, then. I guess we're safe as long as we stay silent. But let's swear our promise again, just in case. It feels more secure.' 'I agree.'

Though he couldn't think why he would be suspected, he still felt nervous hearing the gossip. It kept him uneasy all the time. Tom decided to meet Huck in a secluded spot to talk. He felt it would help to share his worries with someone else, and he also wanted to make sure Huck hadn't told anyone their secret. Tom asked Huck if he'd ever mentioned \"that\" to anyone, and Huck assured him he hadn't, not a single word. Tom admitted his fear, but Huck reminded him that their lives would be in danger if anyone knew their secret. Tom felt better, but wanted to double-check, asking if anyone could make Huck confess. Huck replied that only if he wanted to be drowned by 'that halfbreed devil' would he reveal anything, and there was no other way. Tom was relieved and suggested they swear their secrecy again, just to be sure. Huck agreed, and they repeated their solemn oath."

The typical quiet discussions among the lawyers and the gathering of documents followed. These standard procedures and the resulting delays built up a sense of anticipation that was both serious and captivating.",

For the next two days, he lingered near the courthouse, unable to resist the urge to enter but making himself stay outside. Huck felt the same way. The two of them carefully stayed away from each other. Every so often, they wandered off, but a gloomy curiosity inevitably brought them back. Tom listened closely whenever people came out of the courthouse, but always overheard bad news—things were getting worse for poor Potter. By the end of the second day, the townspeople were saying that Injun Joe’s testimony was strong and went unchallenged, leaving no doubt about what the jury’s decision would be. That night, Tom was out late and climbed into bed through the window, extremely agitated and unable to sleep for hours. The next morning, everyone in the village crowded into the courthouse, eager for what promised to be an important day. The audience was packed, with men and women in almost equal numbers. After a long wait, the jurors entered and took their seats. Soon after, Potter, looking pale, worn out, fearful, and hopeless, was brought in with chains on, placed where everyone could see him; Injun Joe was also there, as unmoved as ever. Following another short delay, the judge appeared and the sheriff announced that the court was in session. As usual, the lawyers whispered among themselves and sorted through their papers. These routines and delays created an atmosphere of tension and anticipation that everyone found both impressive and captivating."

They arrived hot and breathless, and collapsed under the shade of a nearby elm tree to rest and have a smoke. “I like this,” Tom commented. “Me too.” “Say, Huck, if we discover treasure here, what will you do with your share?” “Well, I’ll have pie and a glass of soda pop every day, and I’ll attend every circus that visits. I bet I’ll have a fantastic time.” “Well, aren’t you going to save any of it?” “Save it? What for?” “Why, so you’ll have something to live on later on.” “Oh, that’s useless. Pap would just come back to this town someday and get his hands on it if I didn’t spend it quickly, and I assure you he’d clear it out fast. What are you going to do with yours, Tom?” “I’m going to buy a new drum, and a proper sword, and a red necktie, and a bull pup, and get married.” “Married!” “That’s right.” “Tom, you – why, you must be out of your mind.” “Wait – you’ll see.” “Well, that’s the most foolish thing you could possibly do. Look at Pap and my mother. Fighting! Why, they used to fight all the time. I remember it clearly.” “That doesn’t matter. The girl I’m going to marry won’t fight.” “Tom, I suspect they’re all the same. They’ll all give someone a hard time. Now, you really should think about this for a while. I’m telling you, you should. What’s the name of the girl?” “It’s not a gal at all – it’s a girl.” “It amounts to the same thing, I guess; some say gal, some say girl – both are likely correct. Anyway, what’s her name, Tom?” “I’ll tell you sometime – not now.” “Alright – that works. Only if you get married, I’ll feel even more lonely than ever.” “No, you won’t. You’ll come and live with me. Now, get up from here and we’ll go digging.”",

Now hang it all, we got to come back in the night. It’s an awful long way. Can you get out?”\n“I bet I will. We’ve got to do it tonight, too, because if somebody sees these holes they’ll know in a minute what’s here and they’ll go for it.”\n“Well, I’ll come around and maow tonight.”\n“All right.

It’s on her property.” “She take it away! Let her try!” Tom retorted. “Whoever discovers one of these hidden treasures, it belongs to them. It doesn’t matter whose land it’s on.” That explanation satisfied Huck, and they went back to work. After a while, Huck exclaimed, “Darn it, we must be in the wrong spot again.

We absolutely have to do it tonight, because if someone sees these holes, they’ll instantly know what’s here and go for the treasure themselves.” “Okay, I’ll come by and meow tonight,” Huck agreed. “Alright.

Tom thought they'd try under the old tree on Cardiff Hill, behind the widow’s house. Huck agreed but wondered if the widow would take the treasure, since it was her land. Tom insisted that whoever finds hidden treasure gets to keep it, no matter whose property it’s on, which satisfied Huck. They continued digging, but soon Huck worried that they might still be in the wrong place. Tom was puzzled too, suspecting that perhaps witches were interfering, but Huck reminded him that witches have no power during daylight. Then Tom realized they were supposed to start digging where the shadow of a tree limb fell at midnight. Huck was frustrated that they’d wasted their effort and concluded they would need to come back and dig at night, before anyone saw the fresh holes and grew suspicious. They agreed on a plan to sneak out again that night, and decided to hide their tools in the bushes until then."

But you know mighty well people don’t go about that ha’nted house in the day nor the night.”\n“Well, that’s mostly because they don’t like to go where a man’s been murdered, anyway—but nothing’s ever been seen around that house except in the night—just some blue lights slipping by the windows—no regular ghosts.”\n“Well, where you see one of them blue lights flickering around, Tom, you can bet there’s a ghost mighty close behind it.

He elaborated that while deceased individuals might potentially speak, they don't silently glide around in burial clothes, sneak up behind you unexpectedly, and gnash their teeth like specters. He insisted that neither he nor anyone else could endure such an experience. Tom countered that ghosts are active only at night and therefore wouldn't hinder their daytime digging plans. Huck conceded this point but noted that people universally avoid the haunted house, regardless of the time of day. Tom clarified that the avoidance was largely due to a past murder on the premises, emphasizing that only some blue lights, not actual ghosts, had ever been observed near the house, and only at night. Huck argued that the presence of flickering blue lights was a strong indicator of a nearby ghost, stating it was logical since, in his belief, only ghosts utilize such lights. Tom agreed about the lights but reiterated that their absence during the day meant there was no cause for fear. Huck reluctantly agreed to attempt the haunted house if Tom insisted, though he viewed it as a dangerous gamble. They were now walking down the hill.

I couldn’t handle something like that—no one could.”\n\nTom reassured him, “But ghosts only come out at night, Huck. If we dig there during the day, they won’t bother us.”\n\n“Maybe, but you know people avoid that haunted house day and night.”\n\nTom said, “That’s mostly because someone was murdered there, but really, nothing strange happens during the day—just those blue lights at night. There haven’t been any actual ghosts seen.”\n\n“Tom, any time you see blue lights moving around, you can be sure a ghost is nearby. Only ghosts would use those lights,” Huck insisted.\n\n“Yeah, but still, if we go during the day, why be scared?” Tom argued.\n\n“Alright then, we’ll try the haunted house if you want, but I think it’s risky,” Huck agreed.\n\nBy this time, they were descending the hill. In the moonlit valley stood the haunted house, completely alone, its fence rotted away years ago, thick weeds covering the doorstep, the chimney broken, windows empty, and part of the roof collapsed. The boys stared at it for a while, half-expecting to see a blue light pass by a window. Speaking quietly, as suited the spooky scene, they veered wide of the house and made their way home through the woods behind Cardiff Hill."

Tom was impatient to go to the haunted house; Huck was measurably so, also—but suddenly said:\n“Lookyhere, Tom, do you know what day it is?”\nTom mentally ran over the days of the week, and then quickly lifted his eyes with a startled look in them—\n“My! I never once thought of it, Huck!”\n“Well, I didn’t neither, but all at once it popped onto me that it was Friday.”\n“Blame it, a body can’t be too careful, Huck. We might ’a’ got into an awful scrape, tackling such a thing on a Friday.”\n“Might! Better say we would! There’s some lucky days, maybe, but Friday ain’t.”\n“Any fool knows that. I don’t reckon you was the first that found it out, Huck.”\n“Well, I never said I was, did I? And Friday ain’t all, neither. I had a rotten bad dream last night—dreampt about rats.”\n“No! Sure sign of trouble. Did they fight?”\n“No.”\n“Well, that’s good, Huck. When they don’t fight it’s only a sign that there’s trouble around, you know. All we got to do is to look mighty sharp and keep out of it. We’ll drop this thing for today, and play. Do you know Robin Hood, Huck?”\n“No. Who’s Robin Hood?”\n“Why, he was one of the greatest men that was ever in England—and the best. He was a robber.”\n“Cracky, I wisht I was. Who did he rob?”\n“Only sheriffs and bishops and rich people and kings, and such like. But he never bothered the poor. He loved ’em. He always divided up with ’em perfectly square.”\n“Well, he must ’a’ been a brick.”\n“I bet you he was, Huck. Oh, he was the noblest man that ever was. They ain’t any such men now, I can tell you. He could lick any man in England, with one hand tied behind him; and he could take his yew bow and plug a ten-cent piece every time, a mile and a half.”\n“What’s a yew bow?”\n“I don’t know. It’s some kind of a bow, of course. And if he hit that dime only on the edge he would set down and cry—and curse. But we’ll play Robin Hood—it’s nobby fun. I’ll learn you.”\n“I’m agreed.”\nSo they played Robin Hood all the afternoon, now and then casting a yearning eye down upon the haunted house and passing a remark about the morrow’s prospects and possibilities there. As the sun began to sink into the west they took their way homeward athwart the long shadows of the trees and soon were buried from sight in the forests of Cardiff Hill.",
          "paraphrase_gemini-2.5-flash-preview-04-17": "Around midday the next day, the boys arrived at the dead tree, having come for their tools. Tom was eager to go to the haunted house, and Huck was also pretty keen. But suddenly, Huck said, \"Look here, Tom, do you know what day it is?\" Tom mentally reviewed the days of the week and then quickly looked up with a startled expression. \"My! I never thought of it even once, Huck!\" \"Well, I didn't either, but all of a sudden it occurred to me that it was Friday.\" \"Damn it, one cannot be too careful, Huck. We could have gotten into a terrible mess, attempting something like that on a Friday.\" \"Could have! Better say we would! There might be some lucky days, but Friday isn't one.\" \"Any fool knows that. I don't think you were the first person to discover that, Huck.\" \"Well, I never said I was, did I? And Friday isn't the only issue, either. I had a really bad dream last night—dreamt about rats.\" \"No! That's a definite sign of trouble. Were they fighting?\" \"No.\" \"Okay, that's good, Huck. When they don't fight, it's just a sign that trouble is around, you see. All we need to do is be extremely vigilant and avoid it. We'll postpone this activity for today and play instead. Do you know about Robin Hood, Huck?\" \"No. Who is Robin Hood?\" \"Why, he was one of the greatest men who ever lived in England—and the best. He was a robber.\" \"Wow, I wish I were. Who did he rob?\" \"Only sheriffs and bishops and rich people and kings, and the like. But he never bothered the poor. He loved them. He always shared everything with them perfectly fairly.\" \"Well, he must have been a great fellow.\" \"I bet he was, Huck. Oh, he was the most noble man who ever existed. There aren't any men like that now, I assure you. He could defeat any man in England, even with one hand tied behind him; and he could use his yew bow to hit a ten-cent coin every single time from a mile and a half away.\" \"What's a yew bow?\" \"I don't know. It's some type of bow, obviously. And if he only hit the very edge of that dime, he would sit down and cry—and curse. But we'll play Robin Hood—it's excellent fun. I'll teach you.\" \"I agree.\" So they spent the entire afternoon playing Robin Hood, occasionally casting a longing gaze towards the haunted house and discussing the next day's possibilities and prospects there. As the sun began to set in the west, they headed homeward through the long shadows of the trees and soon disappeared from view within the forests of Cardiff Hill.",

Tom was eager to visit the haunted house, and Huck was somewhat keen as well. Suddenly Huck paused and asked, “Tom, do you know what day it is?” Tom quickly thought through the days and looked startled when he realized, “Wow! I hadn’t even considered it, Huck!”\n\n“Me neither,” Huck replied, “but it just hit me that today’s Friday.”\n\n“Gee, we really need to be careful, Huck. Doing this on a Friday could have landed us in big trouble.”\n\n“Trouble? It sure would have! Maybe some days are lucky, but Friday definitely isn’t.”\n\n“Everybody knows that, Huck. I doubt you’re the first one to figure that out.”\n\n“I never claimed to be,” Huck replied. “Besides, Friday’s not the only bad thing. I had an awful nightmare about rats last night.”\n\n“Really? That’s a clear sign of bad luck. Were the rats fighting?”\n\n“No.”\n\n“Well, that’s better. If they don’t fight, it just means there’s trouble nearby. All we have to do is be really careful to avoid it. Let’s leave this for today and play instead. Do you know who Robin Hood is, Huck?”\n\n“No, who’s that?”\n\n“He was one of the greatest and best men ever in England—a famous robber.”\n\n“Wow, I wish I was a robber. Who did he rob?”\n\n“Just sheriffs, bishops, kings, and rich folks. He never bothered poor people—he loved them. He always shared everything fairly with them.”\n\n“Sounds like he was a great guy.”\n\n“He definitely was, Huck. There’s nobody like him now. He could beat anyone in England, even with one hand tied behind his back, and he could hit a dime from a mile and a half away using his yew bow.”\n\n“What’s a yew bow?”\n\n“I’m not sure, but it’s a kind of bow. If he only clipped the edge of the coin, he’d get upset and curse. But let’s pretend to be Robin Hood—it’s a lot of fun. I’ll teach you.”\n\n“Alright, I’m in.”\n\nThey spent the whole afternoon pretending to be Robin Hood, occasionally glancing at the haunted house and talking about what they might do there the next day. As the sun began to set, they made their way home, disappearing among the shadows of the trees on Cardiff Hill."

They had a smoke and a chat in the shade, and then dug a little in their last hole, not with great hope, but merely because Tom said there were so many cases where people had given up a treasure after getting down within six inches of it, and then somebody else had come along and turned it up with a single thrust of a shovel. The thing failed this time, however, so the boys shouldered their tools and went away feeling that they had not trifled with fortune, but had fulfilled all the requirements that belong to the business of treasure-hunting.\nWhen they reached the haunted house there was something so weird and grisly about the dead silence that reigned there under the baking sun, and something so depressing about the loneliness and desolation of the place, that they were afraid, for a moment, to venture in. Then they crept to the door and took a trembling peep. They saw a weedgrown, floorless room, unplastered, an ancient fireplace, vacant windows, a ruinous staircase; and here, there, and everywhere hung ragged and abandoned cobwebs. They presently entered, softly, with quickened pulses, talking in whispers, ears alert to catch the slightest sound, and muscles tense and ready for instant retreat.\nIn a little while familiarity modified their fears and they gave the place a critical and interested examination, rather admiring their own boldness, and wondering at it, too. Next they wanted to look upstairs. This was something like cutting off retreat, but they got to daring each other, and of course there could be but one result—they threw their tools into a corner and made the ascent. Up there were the same signs of decay. In one corner they found a closet that promised mystery, but the promise was a fraud—there was nothing in it. Their courage was up now and well in hand.

They enjoyed a smoke and a chat in the shade, and then dug a little in their previous excavation site, not expecting much but motivated by Tom's assertion that many people had abandoned treasures when they were only six inches away from finding them, allowing someone else to easily unearth them with a single shovel thrust. This attempt, however, yielded nothing. So, the boys picked up their tools and left, feeling they had not wasted an opportunity but had fully met the demands of treasure hunting. Upon arriving at the haunted house, the complete silence under the strong sun felt so strange and unsettling, and the place's loneliness and ruin were so disheartening, that they were momentarily too scared to go in. They then cautiously approached the door and peered inside, trembling slightly. They observed a room with no floor, overgrown with weeds, lacking plaster, containing an old fireplace, empty window openings, a dilapidated staircase, and draped with neglected, torn cobwebs everywhere. They soon entered quietly, with their heartbeats quickening, whispering, their ears tuned for any sound, and their muscles ready for an immediate retreat. After a short while, getting accustomed to the setting lessened their fears, and they began to examine the place with curiosity and interest, feeling a bit proud of their own courage and also wondering at it. Their next desire was to explore upstairs. This felt somewhat like trapping themselves, but they started daring each other, and of course, the result was predictable—they tossed their tools into a corner and ascended.

This time, though, they found nothing, so they packed up their tools and left, feeling they had done everything required of treasure hunters and not simply gotten lucky. When they came to the haunted house, they paused, unsettled by the eerie silence under the hot sun and the place's lonely, desolate atmosphere, making them briefly afraid to go inside.

Before long, they got used to the surroundings, grew braver, and even admired themselves for their courage. Soon they dared each other to check upstairs, even though it meant cutting off a quick escape. As expected, they all went up, tossing their tools aside.

The Spaniard was wrapped in a serape; he had bushy white whiskers; long white hair flowed from under his sombrero, and he wore green goggles.

No—they’re coming.... Here they are. Don’t utter another sound, Huck. Oh, how I wish I weren’t here!” Two men entered. Each boy thought to himself: “That’s the same old deaf and mute Spaniard who’s been seen in town a couple of times recently—I’ve never seen the other man before.” The “other” man was scruffy and unkempt, with an unpleasant look about him. The Spaniard was wrapped in a cloak (serape); he had thick white sideburns; long white hair streamed from under his wide-brimmed hat (sombrero), and he wore green spectacles.

It won’t ever be discovered that we attempted it, anyway, since we didn’t succeed.” “Well, what’s more hazardous than showing up here during the day!—anyone who spotted us would be suspicious.” “I know that. But there wasn’t any other place as convenient after that botched job. I want to abandon this shack. I wanted to yesterday, but it was useless trying to slip out, with those troublesome boys playing right there on the hill, clearly visible.” “Those troublesome boys” shivered again upon hearing this comment, and felt fortunate that they had remembered it was Friday and decided to postpone their visit by a day.

We’ll do that ‘dangerous’ job after I’ve spied around a little and think things look well for it. Then for Texas! We’ll leg it together!”\nThis was satisfactory. Both men presently fell to yawning, and Injun Joe said:\n“I’m dead for sleep! It’s your turn to watch.”\nHe curled down in the weeds and soon began to snore.

I’m going to risk sneaking back into this town one more time for a look around. We’ll tackle that ‘dangerous’ job after I’ve done some scouting and I’m sure conditions are favorable. Then we’ll head for Texas! We’ll travel there together!” This plan satisfied the other man. Both men soon started yawning, and Injun Joe declared: “I’m exhausted and need sleep! It’s your turn to keep watch.” He lay down in the weeds and quickly began snoring. His companion nudged him a couple of times, causing him to quiet down. Soon after, the watcher started to get drowsy; his head drooped lower and lower, and now both men were snoring. The boys let out a long, relieved breath. Tom whispered: “Now’s our chance—let’s go!” Huck replied: “I can’t—I’d be terrified if they woke up.” Tom encouraged him—Huck held back. Finally, Tom got up slowly and quietly and began to leave by himself. But his very first step caused such a terrible creak from the unstable floorboards that he collapsed back down, nearly paralyzed with fear. He didn't attempt to move a second time.

We'll escape together!\" This plan seemed good to both of them. Soon, they were both yawning, and Injun Joe said he was exhausted and that it was the other's turn to keep watch. He lay down in the grass and quickly fell asleep, snoring. His partner nudged him occasionally, making him quiet down, but soon the watcher himself began to doze off, his head drooping; eventually, both were snoring. The boys witnessing this sighed in relief. Tom whispered, \"Now's our chance—let's go!\" Huck replied, \"I can't—I'd die if they woke up.\" Tom tried to encourage him, but Huck was too scared. Finally, Tom carefully got up to leave by himself, but the first step he took caused the rickety floor to creak loudly, scaring him so much that he immediately dropped back down and didn't try again. The boys lay there, anxiously counting the slow minutes, feeling like time was dragging endlessly, until they finally saw the sun begin to set and felt thankful."

I’ll watch the whole night long, and I’ll do it every night, too, if you’ll do the other part of the job.”\n“All right, I will. All you got to do is to trot up Hooper Street a block and maow—and if I’m asleep, you throw some gravel at the window and that’ll fetch me.”\n“Agreed, and good as wheat!”\n“Now, Huck, the storm’s over, and I’ll go home. It’ll begin to be daylight in a couple of hours. You go back and watch that long, will you?”\n“I said I would, Tom, and I will. I’ll ha’nt that tavern every night for a year! I’ll sleep all day and I’ll stand watch all night.”\n“That’s all right. Now, where you going to sleep?”\n“In Ben Rogers’ hayloft. He lets me, and so does his pap’s nigger man, Uncle Jake. I tote water for Uncle Jake whenever he wants me to, and any time I ask him he gives me a little something to eat if he can spare it. That’s a mighty good nigger, Tom. He likes me, becuz I don’t ever act as if I was above him. Sometime I’ve set right down and eat with him. But you needn’t tell that. A body’s got to do things when he’s awful hungry he wouldn’t want to do as a steady thing.”\n“Well, if I don’t want you in the daytime, I’ll let you sleep. I won’t come bothering around.

Now, if we keep a constant watch every night, eventually we're bound to see him depart, and at that precise moment, we'll grab that box incredibly quickly.\"\nHuck replied, \"Okay, I agree.

He allows it, and so does his dad's black worker, Uncle Jake. I carry water for Uncle Jake whenever he needs me to, and he gives me a little food any time I ask if he has some to spare. He's a really kind black man, Tom. He likes me because I never act like I'm better than him. Sometimes I've even sat right down and eaten with him. But you don't need to tell anyone that.

It was not the custom for elderly people to mar the picnics with their presence. The children were considered safe enough under the wings of a few young ladies of eighteen and a few young gentlemen of twenty-three or thereabouts. The old steam ferry-boat was chartered for the occasion; presently the gay throng filed up the main street laden with provision-baskets. Sid was sick and had to miss the fun; Mary remained at home to entertain him. The last thing Mrs. Thatcher said to Becky, was:\n“You’ll not get back till late. Perhaps you’d better stay all night with some of the girls that live near the ferry-landing, child.”\n“Then I’ll stay with Susy Harper, mamma.”\n“Very well. And mind and behave yourself and don’t be any trouble.”\nPresently, as they tripped along, Tom said to Becky:\n“Say—I’ll tell you what we’ll do. ’Stead of going to Joe Harper’s we’ll climb right up the hill and stop at the Widow Douglas’. She’ll have ice-cream! She has it most every day—dead loads of it. And she’ll be awful glad to have us.”\n“Oh, that will be fun!”\nThen Becky reflected a moment and said:\n“But what will mamma say?”\n“How’ll she ever know?”\nThe girl turned the idea over in her mind, and said reluctantly:\n“I reckon it’s wrong—but—”\n“But shucks! Your mother won’t know, and so what’s the harm? All she wants is that you’ll be safe; and I bet you she’d ’a’ said go there if she’d ’a’ thought of it. I know she would!”\nThe Widow Douglas’ splendid hospitality was a tempting bait. It and Tom’s persuasions presently carried the day. So it was decided to say nothing to anybody about the night’s programme. Presently it occurred to Tom that maybe Huck might come this very night and give the signal. The thought took a deal of the spirit out of his anticipations. Still he could not bear to give up the fun at Widow Douglas’. And why should he give it up, he reasoned—the signal did not come the night before, so why should it be any more likely to come tonight? The sure fun of the evening outweighed the uncertain treasure; and, boy-like, he determined to yield to the stronger inclination and not allow himself to think of the box of money another time that day.",

The children were thought to be sufficiently protected under the care of a few young women around eighteen and some young men about twenty-three years old. The old steam ferry-boat had been hired for the outing. Soon after, the happy crowd, loaded with baskets of food, walked in a line up the main street. Sid was ill and had to miss the event; Mary stayed home to look after him. The final thing Mrs. Thatcher said to Becky was: 'You won't be back until late. Perhaps it would be better if you stayed overnight with some of the girls who live near where the ferry lands, child.' Becky replied, 'Then I'll stay with Susy Harper, Mother.' Mrs. Thatcher said, 'Very well. And remember to behave yourself and don't cause any trouble.' Shortly after, as they strolled along, Tom suggested to Becky: 'Hey, I've got an idea. Instead of going to Joe Harper's, we'll go right up the hill and stop at the Widow Douglas's place. She'll have ice-cream! She has heaps of it nearly every day – absolutely loads. And she'll be incredibly happy to see us.' Becky exclaimed, 'Oh, that sounds like so much fun!' Then Becky paused to think and said: 'But what will my mother say?' Tom asked, 'How will she ever find out?' The girl considered the idea, then said with hesitation: 'I guess it's not right—but—' Tom interrupted, 'Oh, come on! Your mother won't know, so what's the harm? All she cares about is that you're safe; and I bet she would have said it was okay to go there if she'd thought of it. I know she would!' The Widow Douglas's incredible hospitality was a very attractive prospect. That, coupled with Tom's convincing arguments, eventually won her over. Consequently, they decided not to tell anyone about their plans for the night. A moment later, it occurred to Tom that maybe Huck might actually come and give the signal that very night. This thought took away a good deal of his eager anticipation. Still, he couldn't bring himself to pass up the fun at the Widow Douglas's. And why should he miss out, he reasoned – the signal hadn't arrived the night before, so why would it be any more likely to come tonight? The guaranteed enjoyment of the evening outweighed the potential, uncertain treasure; and, in typical boy fashion, he decided to give in to his stronger desire and not let himself think about the box of money again for the rest of the day.",

Becky was excited but wondered about her mother’s opinion. Tom reassured her that her mother wouldn’t find out and would have approved if she’d considered it. Tempted by the thought of ice-cream and Tom’s encouragement, Becky agreed, and they decided to keep their plans a secret. Meanwhile, Tom remembered that Huck might come that night to give a signal, which dampened his excitement a bit.

The crowd swarmed ashore and soon the forest distances and craggy heights echoed far and near with shoutings and laughter. All the different ways of getting hot and tired were gone through with, and by-and-by the rovers straggled back to camp fortified with responsible appetites, and then the destruction of the good things began. After the feast there was a refreshing season of rest and chat in the shade of spreading oaks. By-and-by somebody shouted:\n“Who’s ready for the cave?”\nEverybody was. Bundles of candles were procured, and straightway there was a general scamper up the hill. The mouth of the cave was up the hillside—an opening shaped like a letter A. Its massive oaken door stood unbarred. Within was a small chamber, chilly as an icehouse, and walled by Nature with solid limestone that was dewy with a cold sweat. It was romantic and mysterious to stand here in the deep gloom and look out upon the green valley shining in the sun. But the impressiveness of the situation quickly wore off, and the romping began again. The moment a candle was lighted there was a general rush upon the owner of it; a struggle and a gallant defence followed, but the candle was soon knocked down or blown out, and then there was a glad clamor of laughter and a new chase. But all things have an end. By-and-by the procession went filing down the steep descent of the main avenue, the flickering rank of lights dimly revealing the lofty walls of rock almost to their point of junction sixty feet overhead. This main avenue was not more than eight or ten feet wide. Every few steps other lofty and still narrower crevices branched from it on either hand—for McDougal’s cave was but a vast labyrinth of crooked aisles that ran into each other and out again and led nowhere. It was said that one might wander days and nights together through its intricate tangle of rifts and chasms, and never find the end of the cave; and that he might go down, and down, and still down, into the earth, and it was just the same—labyrinth under labyrinth, and no end to any of them. No man “knew” the cave. That was an impossible thing. Most of the young men knew a portion of it, and it was not customary to venture much beyond this known portion.

The large group rushed ashore, and soon the shouts and laughter echoed throughout the surrounding forest and rocky hills. They participated in various activities that left them hot and tired, eventually straggling back to their camp with healthy appetites, and then began enjoying their food. After their meal, they spent a pleasant time resting and chatting under the shade of large oak trees. After a while, someone called out, asking who was ready to explore the cave. Everyone was eager. They obtained bundles of candles, and immediately there was a general rush up the hill. The cave's entrance was partway up the hillside, shaped like the letter A. Its large oak door stood open. Inside was a small chamber, as cold as an icehouse, with natural limestone walls that were damp and chilling. Standing in the deep darkness here and looking out at the green valley bathed in sunlight felt both romantic and mysterious. However, the impressive atmosphere quickly faded, and the playful activities resumed. The moment a candle was lit, everyone would rush towards the person holding it; a tussle and a spirited defense would follow, but the candle was usually knocked down or blown out quickly, leading to joyous laughter and a new chase. But all activities eventually end. Soon, the line of people proceeded down the steep slope of the main passage, their flickering lights faintly revealing the high rock walls almost to where they met sixty feet above. This main passage was fairly narrow, only about eight to ten feet wide. Every few steps, other high yet even narrower openings branched off from it on either side. This was because McDougal’s cave was simply a vast, intricate network of winding passages that interconnected and led nowhere. It was said that one could wander through its complex web of rifts and chasms for days and nights without ever finding the end of the cave. They could descend deeper and deeper into the earth, and it would be the same – labyrinth under labyrinth, with no end to any of them. No one truly 'knew' the cave; it was considered an impossible feat.

When someone lit a candle, others rushed toward them, resulting in a lively scramble to keep the flame lit, but the candle was inevitably extinguished, followed by laughter and another chase. Eventually, the group formed a procession, venturing down the steep main passageway of the cave, their flickering candlelight revealing the tall stone walls arching above them. The main corridor was only about eight or ten feet wide, with narrow passageways branching off in various directions, as McDougal’s cave was a vast maze of twisting passages that seemed to go on endlessly. It was said that a person could wander for days without finding an exit, descending ever deeper into the earth, with more and more corridors crossing each other. No one truly knew the entire cave.

They went straight ahead, then, until they came to the path that led up Cardiff Hill; this they took. They passed by the old Welshman’s house, halfway up the hill, without hesitating, and still climbed upward. Good, thought Huck, they will bury it in the old quarry. But they never stopped at the quarry. They passed on, up the summit. They plunged into the narrow path between the tall sumach bushes, and were at once hidden in the gloom. Huck closed up and shortened his distance, now, for they would never be able to see him. He trotted along awhile; then slackened his pace, fearing he was gaining too fast; moved on a piece, then stopped altogether; listened; no sound; none, save that he seemed to hear the beating of his own heart. The hooting of an owl came over the hill—ominous sound! But no footsteps. Heavens, was everything lost! He was about to spring with winged feet, when a man cleared his throat not four feet from him! Huck’s heart shot into his throat, but he swallowed it again; and then he stood there shaking as if a dozen agues had taken charge of him at once, and so weak that he thought he must surely fall to the ground.

But I’ll take it out of her.”\n“Oh, don’t kill her! Don’t do that!”\n“Kill? Who said anything about killing? I would kill him if he was here; but not her. When you want to get revenge on a woman you don’t kill her—bosh! you go for her looks. You slit her nostrils—you notch her ears like a sow!”\n“By God, that’s—”\n“Keep your opinion to yourself! It will be safest for you. I’ll tie her to the bed. If she bleeds to death, is that my fault? I’ll not cry, if she does.

His initial instinct was to flee. But then he remembered the kindness the Widow Douglas had shown him multiple times and considered that these men might intend to murder her. He wished he were brave enough to attempt to warn her, but he knew he didn't dare, fearing they would discover and catch him.

Now – look over here – now you can see, can't you?\" The stranger confirmed, \"Yes. Well, it looks like there is company there, I suppose. We should probably abandon this plan.\" Injun Joe reacted angrily, \"Give up now, just as I'm leaving this country forever! Give up and possibly never get another opportunity. I repeat, as I've said before, I don't want her money or valuables – you can have those. But her husband was cruel to me – he was cruel many times – and significantly, he was the justice of the peace who jailed me for being a vagrant. And that's not all. That's not even a tiny fraction of it! He had me publicly whipped with a horsewhip! – whipped in front of the jail, just like a slave! – with everyone in town watching! Horsewhipped! – do you understand? He wronged me and then died. But I will get my retribution from her.\" The stranger pleaded, \"Oh, don't kill her! Please don't do that!\" Injun Joe scoffed, \"Kill? Who said anything about killing? I would kill him if he were alive and here; but not her. When you seek revenge on a woman, you don't kill her – nonsense! You target her appearance. You cut her nostrils – you slice notches in her ears like you would a pig!\" The stranger began to respond, \"By God, that's—\" but Injun Joe cut him off sharply, \"Keep your thoughts to yourself! It will be safer for you that way. I will tie her down to the bed. If she bleeds to death, is that my fault? I won't feel sorry if she does. My friend, you are going to help me with this – for my benefit – that's why you are here – I might not be able to do it alone. If you show any hesitation, I will kill you. Is that clear? And if I have to kill you, I will kill her as well – and then, I figure, no one will ever know much about who was responsible for this business.\" The stranger, trembling, replied, \"Alright, if it has to be done, let's just get it over with. The sooner the better – I'm shaking all over.\" Injun Joe dismissed the idea, \"Do it right now? With company inside? Look here – I'll start to suspect you the moment you suggest things like that.

He took another step back, with the same elaboration and the same risks; then another and another, and—a twig snapped under his foot! His breath stopped and he listened. There was no sound—the stillness was perfect. His gratitude was measureless. Now he turned in his tracks, between the walls of sumach bushes—turned himself as carefully as if he were a ship—and then stepped quickly but cautiously along. When he emerged at the quarry he felt secure, and so he picked up his nimble heels and flew. Down, down he sped, till he reached the Welshman’s. He banged at the door, and presently the heads of the old man and his two stalwart sons were thrust from windows.\n“What’s the row there? Who’s banging? What do you want?”\n“Let me in—quick! I’ll tell everything.”\n“Why, who are you?”\n“Huckleberry Finn—quick, let me in!”\n“Huckleberry Finn, indeed! It ain’t a name to open many doors, I judge! But let him in, lads, and let’s see what’s the trouble.”\n“Please don’t ever tell I told you,” were Huck’s first words when he got in. “Please don’t—I’d be killed, sure—but the widow’s been good friends to me sometimes, and I want to tell—I will tell if you’ll promise you won’t ever say it was me.”\n“By George, he has got something to tell, or he wouldn’t act so!” exclaimed the old man; “out with it and nobody here’ll ever tell, lad.”\nThree minutes later the old man and his sons, well armed, were up the hill, and just entering the sumach path on tiptoe, their weapons in their hands. Huck accompanied them no further. He hid behind a great bowlder and fell to listening.

Holding his breath, he carefully took a step back, balancing precariously on one leg and nearly falling before planting his foot firmly. He repeated this cautious, risky maneuver, taking another step back, and then two more. Suddenly, a twig snapped beneath his foot. His breath hitched, and he froze, listening intently. Absolute silence followed, bringing him immense relief. Turning cautiously between the sumac bushes, like a ship changing direction, he then moved quickly but carefully forward. Reaching the safety of the quarry, he felt secure enough to run as fast as he could. He raced downhill until he arrived at the Welshman’s house, pounding on the door. Soon, the Welshman and his two strong sons appeared at the windows. “What’s all the noise? Who’s banging? What do you need?” they called out. “Let me in fast! I’ll explain everything,” Huck pleaded. “Who are you?” they asked. “Huckleberry Finn—quick, let me in!” he urged. The old man remarked, “Huckleberry Finn, is it? Not a name usually welcomed everywhere, I’d say! But let him in, boys, let’s find out what the problem is.” As soon as he was inside, Huck’s first words were, “Please promise you’ll never say I told you. Please don’t—they’d definitely kill me. But the widow has been kind to me sometimes, and I need to tell—I will tell if you swear you won’t reveal it was me.” The old man exclaimed, “By George, he clearly has something important to say, acting like that! Speak up, lad, and no one here will ever tell.” Three minutes later, the old man and his sons, armed and prepared, were silently moving up the hill, entering the sumac path on their toes, weapons ready. Huck did not go with them. He hid behind a large rock and listened. After a tense, prolonged silence, there was a sudden sound of gunfire and a shout. Huck didn’t wait to hear more details. He sprang up and ran down the hill as fast as he possibly could.",

He planted his foot carefully, balancing on one leg in a wobbly manner—almost losing his balance—first one way, then the other. Slowly, step by step, he moved backwards, each move as careful and risky as the last. Suddenly, he accidentally stepped on a twig and it snapped loudly. Huck froze and listened. Nothing happened—the silence was complete, and he felt immense relief. Then he slowly turned around inside the sumach bushes, turning himself as carefully as if he were a ship changing direction, and began to move away quickly but quietly. Once he reached the quarry, he felt safe, so he ran as fast as he could towards the Welshman’s house. He knocked hard at the door, and soon the old man and his two strong sons appeared at the windows to see what was happening. They asked who it was and what he wanted. \"Let me in, quick! I'll explain everything,\" Huck said. They questioned his identity, and Huck replied, \"Huckleberry Finn—please let me in!\" The old man commented that Huck’s name wasn’t one that usually got doors opened for him, but told his sons to let him in. Once inside, Huck immediately asked them not to ever reveal that he was the one telling them, as he feared for his life, but explained that since the widow had been kind to him, he felt he had to tell the story—if only they promised to keep his secret. The old man, realizing Huck was serious, promised that no one there would tell, and urged Huck to hurry up and explain. Three minutes later, the old man and his sons, armed, crept up the hill along the sumach path, holding their weapons, while Huck stayed behind. He hid behind a large rock and listened tensely. There was a long, anxious silence—and then suddenly gunshots and a cry rang out. Huck didn’t stop for details; he immediately ran away down the hill as fast as he could."

          "text_segment": "As the earliest suspicion of dawn appeared on Sunday morning, Huck came groping up the hill and rapped gently at the old Welshman’s door. The inmates were asleep, but it was a sleep that was set on a hair-trigger, on account of the exciting episode of the night. A call came from a window:\n“Who’s there!”\nHuck’s scared voice answered in a low tone:\n“Please let me in! It’s only Huck Finn!”\n“It’s a name that can open this door night or day, lad!—and welcome!”\nThese were strange words to the vagabond boy’s ears, and the pleasantest he had ever heard. He could not recollect that the closing word had ever been applied in his case before. The door was quickly unlocked, and he entered. Huck was given a seat and the old man and his brace of tall sons speedily dressed themselves.\n“Now, my boy, I hope you’re good and hungry, because breakfast will be ready as soon as the sun’s up, and we’ll have a piping hot one, too—make yourself easy about that! I and the boys hoped you’d turn up and stop here last night.”\n“I was awful scared,” said Huck, “and I run. I took out when the pistols went off, and I didn’t stop for three mile. I’ve come now becuz I wanted to know about it, you know; and I come before daylight becuz I didn’t want to run across them devils, even if they was dead.”\n“Well, poor chap, you do look as if you’d had a hard night of it—but there’s a bed here for you when you’ve had your breakfast. No, they ain’t dead, lad—we are sorry enough for that. You see we knew right where to put our hands on them, by your description; so we crept along on tiptoe till we got within fifteen feet of them—dark as a cellar that sumach path was—and just then I found I was going to sneeze. It was the meanest kind of luck! I tried to keep it back, but no use—’twas bound to come, and it did come! I was in the lead with my pistol raised, and when the sneeze started those scoundrels a-rustling to get out of the path, I sung out, ‘Fire boys!’ and blazed away at the place where the rustling was. So did the boys. But they were off in a jiffy, those villains, and we after them, down through the woods. I judge we never touched them. They fired a shot apiece as they started, but their bullets whizzed by and didn’t do us any harm. As soon as we lost the sound of their feet we quit chasing, and went down and stirred up the constables. They got a posse together, and went off to guard the river bank, and as soon as it is light the sheriff and a gang are going to beat up the woods. My boys will be with them presently. I wish we had some sort of description of those rascals—’twould help a good deal. But you couldn’t see what they were like, in the dark, lad, I suppose?”\n“Oh yes; I saw them downtown and follered them.”\n“Splendid! Describe them—describe them, my boy!”\n“One’s the old deaf and dumb Spaniard that’s ben around here once or twice, and t’other’s a mean-looking, ragged—”\n“That’s enough, lad, we know the men! Happened on them in the woods back of the widow’s one day, and they slunk away. Off with you, boys, and tell the sheriff—get your breakfast tomorrow morning!”",
          "paraphrase_gemini-2.5-flash-preview-04-17": "At the first hint of dawn on Sunday morning, Huck cautiously made his way up the hill and knocked softly at the old Welshman's door. The household was asleep, but the tense events of the previous night meant they were easily roused. A voice called out from a window, asking who was there. Huck's frightened voice responded quietly, asking to be let in and saying it was just him, Huck Finn. The voice immediately replied that his name was always welcome and could open the door any time of day or night. These were strange and the most pleasant words Huck had ever heard; he couldn't recall ever being welcomed like that before. The door was quickly unlocked, and he entered. Huck was given a seat while the old man and his two tall sons quickly got dressed. The Welshman told Huck he hoped he was very hungry, as breakfast would be ready as soon as the sun was up and would be a hot, substantial meal. He added that he and his sons had hoped Huck would have come and stayed with them the night before. Huck explained he was terrified and ran away, taking off when the guns fired and not stopping for three miles. He had come now before daylight because he wanted to find out what happened but wished to avoid encountering the criminals, even if they were dead. The Welshman commented that the poor boy certainly looked like he'd had a difficult night, but there was a bed for him after breakfast. He confirmed that, unfortunately, the men were not dead. He explained that based on Huck's description, they knew exactly where to find the men and crept silently in the intensely dark sumac path until they were about fifteen feet away. Just then, he realized he was going to sneeze. He called it the worst kind of luck and tried desperately to hold it back, but it was going to happen and did. He was in the lead with his pistol ready, and when the sneeze caused the villains to rustle as they tried to escape the path, he yelled \"Fire boys!\" and shot towards the sound. His sons did the same. However, the villains escaped instantly and ran down through the woods with them chasing behind. He didn't think they hit them. The men fired a shot each as they fled, but the bullets missed and didn't harm them. As soon as they could no longer hear the sound of their feet, they stopped chasing and went to wake up the constables. A group was assembled to guard the riverbank, and as soon as it was light, the sheriff and another group would search the woods. His sons would join them soon. The Welshman wished they had some way to describe the criminals, as it would help significantly. He asked Huck if he could see what they looked like in the dark. Huck replied that he had seen them downtown and followed them. Excitedly, the Welshman urged him to describe them. Huck said one was the old deaf and dumb Spaniard who had been in the area a couple of times, and the other was a mean-looking man wearing rags. The Welshman interrupted, saying that was sufficient, they knew who the men were. He mentioned encountering them in the woods behind the widow's house one day, and they had slunk away. He then told his sons to leave immediately to tell the sheriff, skipping breakfast until the following morning.",
          "paraphrase_gpt-4.1-2025-04-14": "As dawn began to break on Sunday morning, Huck slowly made his way up the hill and quietly knocked on the Welshman’s door. Although everyone inside was asleep, it was a light and uneasy sleep after the night’s dramatic events. Someone called from a window, asking who was there. Huck replied nervously and softly, “Please let me in! It’s only Huck Finn!” To his surprise, the response was warm and welcoming: “It’s a name that can open this door any time, day or night!” Huck was touched, as he’d never been welcomed like this before. The door was quickly opened, and Huck was brought inside, where the old Welshman and his two tall sons got dressed in a hurry. The man told Huck that breakfast would be served once the sun came up and that he hoped Huck was hungry. He also mentioned they had hoped Huck would stay with them the previous night. Huck explained that he was extremely frightened when he heard gunshots, so he ran for three miles and only came back now, before dawn, so as not to risk meeting the dangerous men, even if they had been killed. The Welshman reassured Huck and said there would be a bed for him after breakfast, but confirmed that the men weren’t dead. He explained that thanks to Huck’s description, they knew where to find the troublemakers, so they quietly sneaked up on them in the dark. Unfortunately, just as they were close, the old man felt a sneeze coming and couldn’t hold it back, which alerted the villains, who immediately tried to escape. The old man shouted for his sons to fire at the spot where they heard movement, but the outlaws got away. The group chased them briefly, but eventually lost them and then went to alert the constables, who organized a search party that would look along the river bank. At daybreak, the sheriff and a group would comb the woods, with the Welshman’s sons joining in. The old man wished they had a better description of the men, but asked Huck if he had seen them clearly. Huck confirmed that he had followed them downtown and recognized them: one was the old deaf and mute Spaniard seen in town before, and the other looked scruffy and unpleasant. The Welshman immediately recognized the description and sent his sons to alert the sheriff, telling them they would get breakfast the next morning."

Oh, please!”\n“All right if you say it, Huck, but you ought to have the credit of what you did.”\n“Oh no, no! Please don’t tell!”\nWhen the young men were gone, the old Welshman said:\n“They won’t tell—and I won’t. But why don’t you want it known?”\nHuck would not explain, further than to say that he already knew too much about one of those men and would not have the man know that he knew anything against him for the whole world—he would be killed for knowing it, sure.\nThe old man promised secrecy once more, and said:\n“How did you come to follow these fellows, lad? Were they looking suspicious?”\nHuck was silent while he framed a duly cautious reply. Then he said:\n“Well, you see, I’m a kind of a hard lot,—least everybody says so, and I don’t see nothing agin it—and sometimes I can’t sleep much, on account of thinking about it and sort of trying to strike out a new way of doing. That was the way of it last night. I couldn’t sleep, and so I come along upstreet ’bout midnight, a-turning it all over, and when I got to that old shackly brick store by the Temperance Tavern, I backed up agin the wall to have another think. Well, just then along comes these two chaps slipping along close by me, with something under their arm, and I reckoned they’d stole it. One was a-smoking, and t’other one wanted a light; so they stopped right before me and the cigars lit up their faces and I see that the big one was the deaf and dumb Spaniard, by his white whiskers and the patch on his eye, and t’other one was a rusty, ragged-looking devil.”\n“Could you see the rags by the light of the cigars?”\nThis staggered Huck for a moment. Then he said:\n“Well, I don’t know—but somehow it seems as if I did.”\n“Then they went on, and you—”\n“Follered ’em—yes. That was it. I wanted to see what was up—they sneaked along so. I dogged ’em to the widder’s stile, and stood in the dark and heard the ragged one beg for the widder, and the Spaniard swear he’d spile her looks just as I told you and your two—”\n“What! The deaf and dumb man said all that!”\nHuck had made another terrible mistake! He was trying his best to keep the old man from getting the faintest hint of who the Spaniard might be, and yet his tongue seemed determined to get him into trouble in spite of all he could do. He made several efforts to creep out of his scrape, but the old man’s eye was upon him and he made blunder after blunder. Presently the Welshman said:\n“My boy, don’t be afraid of me. I wouldn’t hurt a hair of your head for all the world. No—I’d protect you—I’d protect you. This Spaniard is not deaf and dumb; you’ve let that slip without intending it; you can’t cover that up now. You know something about that Spaniard that you want to keep dark. Now trust me—tell me what it is, and trust me—I won’t betray you.”\nHuck looked into the old man’s honest eyes a moment, then bent over and whispered in his ear:\n“’Tain’t a Spaniard—it’s Injun Joe!”\nThe Welshman almost jumped out of his chair. In a moment he said:\n“It’s all plain enough, now. When you talked about notching ears and slitting noses I judged that that was your own embellishment, because white men don’t take that sort of revenge. But an Injun! That’s a different matter altogether.”",
          "paraphrase_gemini-2.5-flash-preview-04-17": "The sons of the Welshman left immediately. As they were exiting, Huck suddenly spoke up, pleading, “Oh, please, don’t tell anyone it was me who gave them away! Oh, please!” The Welshman’s son replied, “Alright, Huck, if that’s what you want, but you deserve recognition for what you did.” Huck insisted, “Oh no, no! Please don’t tell!” After the young men were gone, the elder Welshman commented, “They won’t tell, and neither will I. But why are you so set on keeping it a secret?” Huck offered no further explanation other than stating he already knew too much about one of the individuals and wouldn't want that man to ever discover that Huck possessed damaging information about him, not for anything in the world—he was sure he would be killed for knowing it. The old man reiterated his promise of confidentiality and inquired, “How did you end up following these fellows, boy? Did they look suspicious?” Huck paused, formulating a careful response. He then said, “Well, you see, I’m considered a bit of a tough case—at least, that’s what everyone says, and I can’t disagree—and sometimes I have trouble sleeping, thinking about it and trying to figure out a different way to live. That’s how it was last night. I couldn’t sleep, so I walked upstreet around midnight, turning it all over in my mind, and when I reached that old, shaky brick store by the Temperance Tavern, I leaned against the wall to think some more. Just then, these two guys came sneaking by me, with something under their arms, and I figured they must have stolen it. One was smoking, and the other asked for a light; so they stopped right in front of me, and the cigar light illuminated their faces, and I saw that the big one was the supposed deaf and dumb Spaniard, recognizable by his white whiskers and the patch over his eye, and the other was a dirty, ragged-looking scoundrel.” “You could see the rags by just the cigar light?” This momentarily surprised Huck. Then he replied, “Well, I’m not sure—but it felt like I did somehow.” “And then they moved on, and you—” “Followed them—yes. That’s right. I wanted to see what they were up to—they were sneaking along like that. I trailed them to the widow’s fence steps and stood in the dark, and I heard the ragged one ask about the widow, and the Spaniard threaten to ruin her appearance, just like I told you and your two—” “What! The man who can’t hear or speak said all that!” Huck had made another significant error! He was desperately trying to prevent the old man from getting the slightest clue about the Spaniard’s true identity, yet his words seemed determined to cause him trouble despite all his efforts. He attempted several times to extricate himself from his predicament, but the old man’s gaze was fixed on him, leading him to make one mistake after another. After a moment, the Welshman said, “My boy, don’t be scared of me. I wouldn’t harm a single hair on your head for anything. No—I’ll protect you—I’ll protect you. This Spaniard isn’t deaf and dumb; you accidentally let that slip; you can’t hide it now. You know something about that Spaniard that you want to keep hidden. Now trust me—tell me what it is, and trust me—I won’t betray your confidence.” Huck looked into the kind eyes of the old man for a moment, then leaned forward and whispered in his ear, “He’s not a Spaniard—it’s Injun Joe!” The Welshman was so startled he almost leaped out of his chair. After a moment, he stated, “It all makes perfect sense now. When you mentioned cutting off ears and splitting noses, I assumed that was your own exaggeration, because white men don’t seek that kind of vengeance. But an Injun! That’s an entirely different situation.”",
          "paraphrase_gpt-4.1-2025-04-14": "The Welshman’s sons left immediately. As they were going, Huck suddenly got up and pleaded, \"Please, don’t tell anyone that I was the one who gave you the information! Please!\" The men replied, \"Alright, since you ask, Huck, but you deserve some recognition for what you did.\" Huck insisted, \"No, no! Just don’t tell anyone!\" After they departed, the old Welshman reassured Huck that they wouldn’t reveal anything, and neither would he, but asked why Huck wanted it kept secret. Huck didn’t give a clear reason, only saying that he knew too much about one of the men and didn’t want him to find out—he feared he’d be killed if the man found out he knew. The old man once more promised to keep it secret and asked how Huck had ended up following the men, wondering if they had seemed suspicious. Huck paused to think carefully before replying. He explained that he had a reputation for getting into trouble—which he admitted was fair—and sometimes he couldn’t sleep, lying awake thinking about changing his ways. That’s what happened the previous night, he said: unable to sleep, he wandered uptown around midnight, pondering everything. When he reached the old, rundown brick store by the Temperance Tavern, he stopped to think. Then, two men came by quietly, carrying something under their arm. Huck guessed they had stolen it. One lit a cigar and the light revealed his face; Huck recognized the big man by his white beard and eye patch as the deaf and dumb Spaniard, and the other as a scruffy, ragged-looking person. The Welshman questioned how Huck could see the rags in the dim light. Huck hesitated, but insisted he somehow did. He continued: the men moved on, and Huck followed them, curious about what they were up to, and trailed them to the widow’s stile. There, the ragged one begged for the widow’s life, and the Spaniard threatened to harm her, just as Huck had already reported. The Welshman was startled—\"What! The deaf and dumb man said that?\" Huck realized he had made a serious mistake. He had been trying not to give away the Spaniard’s identity, but had accidentally revealed too much. Despite his effort to fix his mistake, the Welshman caught on. He reassured Huck that he was safe and urged him to trust him and share the truth. Finally, Huck leaned in close and whispered, \"He isn’t a Spaniard at all—it’s Injun Joe!\" The revelation shocked the Welshman, who quickly understood everything. He explained that earlier, when Huck mentioned certain brutal threats, he thought Huck was exaggerating, as white men didn’t usually seek that kind of vengeance, but an Indian would, which made things much clearer now."

They found none, but captured a bulky bundle of—\n“Of what?”\nIf the words had been lightning they could not have leaped with a more stunning suddenness from Huck’s blanched lips. His eyes were staring wide, now, and his breath suspended—waiting for the answer. The Welshman started—stared in return—three seconds—five seconds—ten—then replied:\n“Of burglar’s tools. Why, what’s the matter with you?”\nHuck sank back, panting gently, but deeply, unutterably grateful. The Welshman eyed him gravely, curiously—and presently said:\n“Yes, burglar’s tools. That appears to relieve you a good deal. But what did give you that turn? What were you expecting we’d found?”\nHuck was in a close place—the inquiring eye was upon him—he would have given anything for material for a plausible answer—nothing suggested itself—the inquiring eye was boring deeper and deeper—a senseless reply offered—there was no time to weigh it, so at a venture he uttered it—feebly:\n“Sunday-school books, maybe.”\nPoor Huck was too distressed to smile, but the old man laughed loud and joyously, shook up the details of his anatomy from head to foot, and ended by saying that such a laugh was money in a-man’s pocket, because it cut down the doctor’s bill like everything. Then he added:\n“Poor old chap, you’re white and jaded—you ain’t well a bit—no wonder you’re a little flighty and off your balance. But you’ll come out of it. Rest and sleep will fetch you out all right, I hope.”\nHuck was irritated to think he had been such a goose and betrayed such a suspicious excitement, for he had dropped the idea that the parcel brought from the tavern was the treasure, as soon as he had heard the talk at the widow’s stile. He had only thought it was not the treasure, however—he had not known that it wasn’t—and so the suggestion of a captured bundle was too much for his self-possession. But on the whole he felt glad the little episode had happened, for now he knew beyond all question that that bundle was not the bundle, and so his mind was at rest and exceedingly comfortable. In fact, everything seemed to be drifting just in the right direction, now; the treasure must be still in No. 2, the men would be captured and jailed that day, and he and Tom could seize the gold that night without any trouble or any fear of interruption.",

His eyes were wide, and he held his breath, anxiously awaiting the answer. The Welshman paused, staring back—three seconds, five seconds, ten—before replying, “Burglar’s tools. What in the world is wrong with you?”\nHuck leaned back, breathing heavily but gently, overwhelmingly thankful. The Welshman observed him with a serious, curious expression and then said, “Yes, burglar’s tools. That seems to have greatly relieved you. But what startled you like that? What were you expecting us to have found?”\nHuck was in a difficult spot, with the questioning gaze fixed upon him. He would have given anything for a believable answer, but nothing came to mind. The persistent look was probing deeper. A nonsensical response popped into his head. With no time to consider it, he blurted it out weakly, taking a chance: “Maybe Sunday-school books.”\nPoor Huck was too distressed to even smile, but the old man burst into loud, happy laughter, shaking from head to foot. He finished by saying that such a laugh was valuable because it significantly reduced the need for a doctor. Then he added, “My poor boy, you look pale and exhausted—you’re not well at all—no wonder you’re a bit jumpy and unbalanced. But you’ll get over it. I hope rest and sleep will fix you up.”\nHuck was annoyed with himself for being such a fool and showing such obvious anxiety. He had dismissed the idea that the package brought from the tavern was the treasure as soon as he heard the talk at the widow's stile. However, he had only thought it wasn't the treasure; he hadn't been certain, so the mention of a captured bundle was too much for him to handle calmly. But overall, he was glad the little incident had occurred, because now he was absolutely certain that *that* particular bundle was not the one he was worried about, allowing his mind to be at ease and extremely comfortable. In fact, everything now seemed to be progressing perfectly; the treasure had to be still in Room No. 2, the criminals would be caught and jailed that day, and he and Tom could get the gold that night without any difficulty or fear of interruption.",

They didn't find any, but did come across a large bundle of—\n\"Of what?\" \nHuck blurted out the words in shock, as if he’d been struck by lightning, his eyes wide and breath held in suspense. The Welshman was taken aback, looked at Huck closely for a few moments, and then answered:\n“Of burglar’s tools. Why, what’s wrong with you?”\nRelieved beyond words, Huck leaned back, breathing deeply. The Welshman eyed him with seriousness and some curiosity, then said:\n“Yes, burglar’s tools. You look much better hearing that. But what made you so jumpy? What did you think we found?”\nCornered, Huck searched for a believable answer, but nothing came to mind. Under the scrutiny of the old man’s gaze, he blurted out the first thing he could think of, albeit weakly:\n“Maybe Sunday-school books.”\nHuck was too distraught to laugh at his own answer, but the old man burst out laughing, shaking with amusement, and joked that such a laugh was good for your health. He continued, “Poor guy, you look pale and exhausted—you’re not yourself, no wonder you’re a little out of sorts. But you’ll recover; some rest and sleep will fix you up.”\n\nHuck felt annoyed that he had been so transparently nervous and had let his anxiety show so much. He'd actually stopped believing the bundle found at the tavern was the treasure after what he heard at the widow’s stile, but he hadn’t been certain. The mention of a mysterious bundle made him lose his composure. Still, he was glad for the whole incident, because now he was absolutely certain that the bundle was not the treasure, which left his mind at ease. Now things seemed to be going his way: the treasure must still be hidden in No. 2, the criminals would be caught that day, and he and Tom could safely retrieve the gold that night without worry."

          "text_segment": "Just as breakfast was completed there was a knock at the door. Huck jumped for a hiding-place, for he had no mind to be connected even remotely with the late event. The Welshman admitted several ladies and gentlemen, among them the Widow Douglas, and noticed that groups of citizens were climbing up the hill—to stare at the stile. So the news had spread. The Welshman had to tell the story of the night to the visitors. The widow’s gratitude for her preservation was outspoken.\n“Don’t say a word about it, madam. There’s another that you’re more beholden to than you are to me and my boys, maybe, but he don’t allow me to tell his name. We wouldn’t have been there but for him.”\nOf course this excited a curiosity so vast that it almost belittled the main matter—but the Welshman allowed it to eat into the vitals of his visitors, and through them be transmitted to the whole town, for he refused to part with his secret. When all else had been learned, the widow said:\n“I went to sleep reading in bed and slept straight through all that noise. Why didn’t you come and wake me?”\n“We judged it warn’t worth while. Those fellows warn’t likely to come again—they hadn’t any tools left to work with, and what was the use of waking you up and scaring you to death? My three negro men stood guard at your house all the rest of the night. They’ve just come back.”\nMore visitors came, and the story had to be told and retold for a couple of hours more.\nThere was no Sabbath-school during day-school vacation, but everybody was early at church. The stirring event was well canvassed. News came that not a sign of the two villains had been yet discovered. When the sermon was finished, Judge Thatcher’s wife dropped alongside of Mrs. Harper as she moved down the aisle with the crowd and said:\n“Is my Becky going to sleep all day? I just expected she would be tired to death.”\n“Your Becky?”\n“Yes,” with a startled look—“didn’t she stay with you last night?”\n“Why, no.”\nMrs. Thatcher turned pale, and sank into a pew, just as Aunt Polly, talking briskly with a friend, passed by. Aunt Polly said:\n“Goodmorning, Mrs. Thatcher. Goodmorning, Mrs. Harper. I’ve got a boy that’s turned up missing. I reckon my Tom stayed at your house last night—one of you. And now he’s afraid to come to church. I’ve got to settle with him.”\nMrs. Thatcher shook her head feebly and turned paler than ever.\n“He didn’t stay with us,” said Mrs. Harper, beginning to look uneasy. A marked anxiety came into Aunt Polly’s face.\n“Joe Harper, have you seen my Tom this morning?”\n“No’m.”\n“When did you see him last?”\nJoe tried to remember, but was not sure he could say. The people had stopped moving out of church. Whispers passed along, and a boding uneasiness took possession of every countenance. Children were anxiously questioned, and young teachers. They all said they had not noticed whether Tom and Becky were on board the ferryboat on the homeward trip; it was dark; no one thought of inquiring if any one was missing. One young man finally blurted out his fear that they were still in the cave! Mrs. Thatcher swooned away. Aunt Polly fell to crying and wringing her hands.",

Huck quickly found a place to hide, determined not to be associated with the previous night's events, even indirectly. The Welshman let in several ladies and gentlemen, including the Widow Douglas, and noticed groups of residents climbing the hill to look at the fence style, showing that the news had spread. The Welshman was obligated to recount the events of the night to his guests. The widow openly expressed her thankfulness for being saved.\n\"Don't mention it, madam. There's someone else you owe a greater debt to than me and my sons, perhaps, but he won't allow me to reveal his name. We wouldn't have been there without him.\"\nThis naturally sparked immense curiosity, almost overshadowing the main incident, but the Welshman allowed their eagerness to consume them, knowing it would spread throughout the town via his visitors, as he refused to disclose his secret. After learning everything else, the widow remarked:\n\"I fell asleep reading in bed and slept through all that commotion. Why didn't you come wake me?\"\n\"We decided it wasn't necessary. Those criminals weren't likely to return; they had no tools left to operate, and what would be the point of waking you up and terrifying you? My three black servants stood guard at your home for the remainder of the night. They've only just returned.\"\nMore visitors arrived, and the narrative had to be repeated countless times for another couple of hours.\nThere was no Sunday school since day school was on break, but everyone arrived at church early. The dramatic incident was widely discussed. News came that no trace of the two culprits had been found yet. When the sermon concluded, Judge Thatcher's wife approached Mrs. Harper as they walked down the aisle with the congregation and asked:\n\"Is my Becky planning to sleep all day? I fully expected she'd be exhausted.\"\n\"Your Becky?\"\n\"Yes,\" she replied, looking startled, \"didn't she spend the night with you?\"\n\"Why, no.\"\nMrs. Thatcher turned pale and sank into a pew just as Aunt Polly, chatting lively with a friend, walked past. Aunt Polly commented:\n\"Good morning, Mrs. Thatcher. Good morning, Mrs. Harper. My boy seems to have disappeared. I assumed my Tom stayed at one of your houses last night. And now he's probably too scared to come to church. I'll deal with him later.\"\nMrs. Thatcher weakly shook her head and grew even paler. \"He didn't stay with us,\" Mrs. Harper said, starting to look worried. A clear look of anxiety crossed Aunt Polly's face.\n\"Joe Harper, have you seen my Tom this morning?\"\n\"No, ma'am.\"\n\"When did you see him last?\"\nJoe tried to recall but wasn't sure he could provide a specific time. The crowd had stopped moving out of the church. Whispers spread, and a sense of foreboding uneasiness settled on everyone's faces. Children and young teachers were questioned anxiously. They all stated they hadn't noticed if Tom and Becky were on the ferryboat returning home; it was dark, and no one had thought to check if anyone was missing.

The Cardiff Hill episode sank into instant insignificance, the burglars were forgotten, horses were saddled, skiffs were manned, the ferryboat ordered out, and before the horror was half an hour old, two hundred men were pouring down highroad and river toward the cave.\nAll the long afternoon the village seemed empty and dead. Many women visited Aunt Polly and Mrs. Thatcher and tried to comfort them. They cried with them, too, and that was still better than words. All the tedious night the town waited for news; but when the morning dawned at last, all the word that came was, “Send more candles—and send food.” Mrs. Thatcher was almost crazed; and Aunt Polly, also. Judge Thatcher sent messages of hope and encouragement from the cave, but they conveyed no real cheer.\nThe old Welshman came home toward daylight, spattered with candle-grease, smeared with clay, and almost worn out. He found Huck still in the bed that had been provided for him, and delirious with fever. The physicians were all at the cave, so the Widow Douglas came and took charge of the patient. She said she would do her best by him, because, whether he was good, bad, or indifferent, he was the Lord’s, and nothing that was the Lord’s was a thing to be neglected. The Welshman said Huck had good spots in him, and the widow said:\n“You can depend on it. That’s the Lord’s mark. He don’t leave it off. He never does. Puts it somewhere on every creature that comes from his hands.”\nEarly in the forenoon parties of jaded men began to straggle into the village, but the strongest of the citizens continued searching. All the news that could be gained was that remotenesses of the cavern were being ransacked that had never been visited before; that every corner and crevice was going to be thoroughly searched; that wherever one wandered through the maze of passages, lights were to be seen flitting hither and thither in the distance, and shoutings and pistol-shots sent their hollow reverberations to the ear down the sombre aisles. In one place, far from the section usually traversed by tourists, the names “BECKY & TOM” had been found traced upon the rocky wall with candle-smoke, and near at hand a grease-soiled bit of ribbon. Mrs. Thatcher recognized the ribbon and cried over it. She said it was the last relic she should ever have of her child; and that no other memorial of her could ever be so precious, because this one parted latest from the living body before the awful death came. Some said that now and then, in the cave, a far-away speck of light would glimmer, and then a glorious shout would burst forth and a score of men go trooping down the echoing aisle—and then a sickening disappointment always followed; the children were not there; it was only a searcher’s light.",
          "paraphrase_gemini-2.5-flash-preview-04-17": "The news of the situation spread rapidly from person to person, group to group, and throughout the streets. In only five minutes, the church bells were ringing wildly, and everyone in town was awake and active. The recent events on Cardiff Hill and the mention of burglars were immediately forgotten. Men quickly prepared by saddling horses, manning boats, and calling out the ferryboat. Within half an hour of the terrifying discovery, two hundred men were heading towards the cave by road and river.\n\nThroughout the long afternoon, the village felt deserted and silent. Many women went to visit Aunt Polly and Mrs. Thatcher, offering comfort and sharing their tears, which provided more solace than words could. The town waited anxiously through the tedious night for any news, but when morning finally arrived, the only message received was, “Send more candles—and send food.” Mrs. Thatcher was nearly driven insane with worry, as was Aunt Polly. Judge Thatcher sent messages from the cave meant to be hopeful and encouraging, but they didn't genuinely lift spirits.\n\nThe elderly Welshman returned around dawn, his clothes stained with candle-grease and smeared with clay, clearly exhausted. He found Huck still in the provided bed, suffering from a fever and delirium. Since all the doctors were at the cave, the Widow Douglas came and took responsibility for caring for Huck. She stated she would do her utmost for him, explaining that regardless of his character, he belonged to the Lord, and therefore should not be neglected. The Welshman commented that Huck possessed good qualities, and the widow affirmed this, saying:\n\n“You can be certain of that. That is God’s mark. He never removes it. He never fails to place it somewhere on every human being he creates.”\n\nEarly that morning, groups of weary searchers began returning to the village, but the most determined citizens continued their search. All the information gathered indicated that parts of the cavern that had never been explored before were being thoroughly searched. Every nook and cranny was being examined. As searchers navigated the complex network of passages, lights could be seen flickering in the distance, and shouts and pistol shots echoed hollowly through the dark aisles. In one area, far from where tourists typically went, the names “BECKY & TOM” were discovered written on the rock wall using candle smoke. Nearby, a small piece of ribbon soiled with grease was found. Mrs. Thatcher recognized the ribbon and wept over it. She declared it was the last memento she would ever have of her child, and that no other keepsake could ever be as precious, because this one was closest to her child's living body just before the terrible fate occurred. Some reported that occasionally, a distant tiny light would appear in the cave, followed by a triumphant shout and a rush of men down an echoing passage—only to be met with crushing disappointment when they found it was merely a searcher's light, not the children.",
          "paraphrase_gpt-4.1-2025-04-14": "The news of the emergency spread rapidly throughout the town—people quickly alerted one another, and soon the church bells were ringing chaotically as everyone was roused. The recent excitement on Cardiff Hill was immediately forgotten, as were worries about the burglars, as the townspeople prepared horses, rowboats, and even the ferry in response. In less than thirty minutes, around two hundred men were heading towards the cave along the main road and the river.\n\nThroughout the rest of the afternoon, the village felt deserted and lifeless. Many women came to visit Aunt Polly and Mrs. Thatcher to offer comfort, often crying alongside them, which was sometimes more consoling than words. The entire night dragged on with the town anxiously waiting for any updates. But when morning came, the only messages were requests for more candles and food. Both Mrs. Thatcher and Aunt Polly were emotionally distraught, and although Judge Thatcher sent encouraging messages from within the cave, they offered little true comfort.\n\nShortly before dawn, the old Welshman returned home, exhausted, covered in candle wax and clay, and almost spent. He found Huck still bedridden with a high fever, and since the doctors were all at the cave, Widow Douglas took care of him. She promised to do her best, believing that every person belonged to God and deserved care. The Welshman vouched for Huck’s good qualities, to which the Widow replied that this was evidence of God’s mark, which she believed God gave to all his creations.\n\nBy midmorning, tired groups of men began to make their way back to the village, but the strongest continued to scour the cavern. All the reports were of searchers venturing into parts of the cave never explored before, determined to inspect every area. Flickering lights and the echoes of voices and gunshots could be seen and heard deep inside. In one unfamiliar area, someone had discovered the names “BECKY & TOM” written on a wall with candle smoke and found a greasy ribbon nearby. Mrs. Thatcher recognized the ribbon, wept over it, and declared it the most precious reminder she could have of her daughter, as it was the last thing to have left her before what she feared was her child’s death. Occasionally, a faint light would appear in the cave and the searchers would shout with hope, but every time it was only another member of the search party, and the children were still missing."

The accidental discovery, just made, that the proprietor of the Temperance Tavern kept liquor on his premises, scarcely fluttered the public pulse, tremendous as the fact was. In a lucid interval, Huck feebly led up to the subject of taverns, and finally asked—dimly dreading the worst—if anything had been discovered at the Temperance Tavern since he had been ill.\n“Yes,” said the widow.\nHuck started up in bed, wildeyed:\n“What? What was it?”\n“Liquor!—and the place has been shut up. Lie down, child—what a turn you did give me!”\n“Only tell me just one thing—only just one—please! Was it Tom Sawyer that found it?”\nThe widow burst into tears. “Hush, hush, child, hush! I’ve told you before, you must not talk. You are very, very sick!”\nThen nothing but liquor had been found; there would have been a great powwow if it had been the gold. So the treasure was gone forever—gone forever! But what could she be crying about? Curious that she should cry.\nThese thoughts worked their dim way through Huck’s mind, and under the weariness they gave him he fell asleep. The widow said to herself:\n“There—he’s asleep, poor wreck. Tom Sawyer find it! Pity but somebody could find Tom Sawyer! Ah, there ain’t many left, now, that’s got hope enough, or strength enough, either, to go on searching.”",

No one had the energy or interest for anything. Even the startling recent discovery that the owner of the Temperance Tavern had secretly kept and sold alcohol, a significant event in itself, caused hardly any reaction from the public, indicating the depth of their despair. In a brief moment of lucidity, Huck faintly mentioned taverns and then hesitantly asked, dreading the potential answer, if anything had been found at the Temperance Tavern since he had been sick. 'Yes,' the widow confirmed. Huck jolted up in bed, his eyes wild with anticipation. 'What? What was it?' 'Alcohol!' the widow answered. 'And they've closed the place down. Lie down, child – you gave me quite a shock!' 'Please, just tell me one thing – only one!' Huck begged. 'Was it Tom Sawyer who discovered it?' The widow began to cry. 'Hush, hush, child, hush! I told you before, you mustn't talk. You are very, very sick!' Huck understood then that only liquor had been found; if it had been the gold, there would have been a massive public announcement. The treasure was gone forever, he thought. But he couldn't understand why she was crying; it seemed strange. These thoughts vaguely processed in Huck's mind, and worn out by them, he drifted into sleep. The widow quietly said to herself, 'There, he's sleeping, poor boy. Tom Sawyer find it! If only someone could find Tom Sawyer! Sadly, there are few left now with enough hope or strength to keep searching.'",

During a brief moment of clarity, Huck weakly began talking about taverns and eventually, with some apprehension, asked whether anything had been found at the Temperance Tavern while he had been ill. The widow replied, \"Yes.\" Huck sat up in bed, startled and anxious, and asked what it was. The widow told him it was liquor, and that the place had been shut down, urging him to lie back down because he had startled her. Huck pleaded for one more answer, wanting to know if Tom Sawyer was the one who had discovered it. The widow began to cry and told Huck to be quiet because he was very sick and shouldn't be talking. Huck realized that only liquor had been found—if it had been the gold, it would have caused a huge commotion. The treasure was gone for good. He wondered why the widow was crying; it seemed odd. These thoughts floated vaguely through Huck's tired mind until he drifted off to sleep. Meanwhile, the widow murmured to herself that Huck was asleep and pitied that nobody could find Tom Sawyer, noting that not many people had enough hope or strength left to keep searching."

Presently the hide-and-seek frolicking began, and Tom and Becky engaged in it with zeal until the exertion began to grow a trifle wearisome; then they wandered down a sinuous avenue holding their candles aloft and reading the tangled webwork of names, dates, postoffice addresses, and mottoes with which the rocky walls had been frescoed (in candle-smoke). Still drifting along and talking, they scarcely noticed that they were now in a part of the cave whose walls were not frescoed. They smoked their own names under an overhanging shelf and moved on. Presently they came to a place where a little stream of water, trickling over a ledge and carrying a limestone sediment with it, had, in the slow-dragging ages, formed a laced and ruffled Niagara in gleaming and imperishable stone.

In one place they found a spacious cavern, from whose ceiling depended a multitude of shining stalactites of the length and circumference of a man’s leg; they walked all about it, wondering and admiring, and presently left it by one of the numerous passages that opened into it. This shortly brought them to a bewitching spring, whose basin was incrusted with a frostwork of glittering crystals; it was in the midst of a cavern whose walls were supported by many fantastic pillars which had been formed by the joining of great stalactites and stalagmites together, the result of the ceaseless water-drip of centuries. Under the roof vast knots of bats had packed themselves together, thousands in a bunch; the lights disturbed the creatures and they came flocking down by hundreds, squeaking and darting furiously at the candles. Tom knew their ways and the danger of this sort of conduct. He seized Becky’s hand and hurried her into the first corridor that offered; and none too soon, for a bat struck Becky’s light out with its wing while she was passing out of the cavern. The bats chased the children a good distance; but the fugitives plunged into every new passage that offered, and at last got rid of the perilous things. Tom found a subterranean lake, shortly, which stretched its dim length away until its shape was lost in the shadows. He wanted to explore its borders, but concluded that it would be best to sit down and rest awhile, first.

It’s all a mixed-up crookedness to me.”\n“I reckon I could find it—but then the bats. If they put our candles out it will be an awful fix.

It was in a cavern where many strange pillars supported the walls, formed by great stalactites and stalagmites joining over centuries of constant water dripping.

Soon they found an enchanting spring with a basin crusted in sparkling crystals, located in a cave whose walls were held up by strange columns formed over centuries by water dripping and joining stalactites to stalagmites. Bats hung in huge clusters from the ceiling; disturbed by the light, hundreds swooped down at the candles. Knowing the risk, Tom quickly grabbed Becky’s hand and rushed her out through a nearby tunnel, just as a bat knocked out Becky’s candle with its wing. The children ran from the bats down passageway after passageway until they finally escaped them. Tom soon came upon an underground lake fading into darkness. He wanted to explore, but decided they should rest first. The oppressive silence of the cave started to weigh on them. Becky remarked that she hadn’t heard any of the others for a while. Tom realized they were far below the group and probably couldn’t hear them even if they were nearby. Becky became uneasy and worried about how much time had passed, suggesting they should go back. Tom agreed, but when Becky asked if he could find the way, he admitted he probably could—unless bats put out their candles again. They decided to try a different route to avoid the bats.

Tom immediately turned back the way they had come and quickened his pace. After a short while, a hesitation in his movements revealed another terrifying truth to Becky—he couldn't find the way back! \"Oh, Tom, you didn't make any marks!\" she cried. \"Becky, I was so foolish! So foolish! I never considered we might need to return! No—I can't find the path. It's completely confusing.\" \"Tom, Tom, we're lost! We're lost! We'll never escape this dreadful place! Oh, why did we ever leave the others!\" she exclaimed. She collapsed onto the ground and began crying uncontrollably, a fit so intense that Tom was terrified she might die or lose her sanity. He sat down beside her and wrapped his arms around her. She buried her face in his chest, clinging to him, pouring out her fears, her pointless regrets, and the distant echoes transformed them all into jeering laughter. Tom pleaded with her to regain hope, but she said she couldn't. He started blaming and criticizing himself for getting them into this terrible predicament, which surprisingly had a positive effect. She said she would try to be hopeful again, she would stand up and follow him wherever he led, as long as he stopped talking like that. For he was no more responsible than she was, she insisted.",

Each time Tom checked, Becky watched him, hoping for encouragement, and he would assure her, “It’s all right. This isn’t it, but we’ll find it soon!” Still, Tom’s hope dwindled with each wrong turn, and soon he began taking random paths, desperately trying to locate the right one. Though he kept saying it was “all right,” fear weighed heavily on him and his reassurances sounded hollow and defeated. Becky stuck close to him, terrified and trying not to cry, but eventually couldn’t help it. She pleaded, “Oh, Tom, forget the bats, let’s go back! We’re only getting more lost.” Tom replied, “Listen!” There was a deep, oppressive silence, so quiet even their breathing stood out. Tom called out, his voice echoing through the empty tunnels and fading away, sounding like mocking laughter. “Don’t do that again, Tom, it’s too awful,” Becky begged. He explained, “I know it’s awful, but we have to try; maybe someone will hear us,” and he shouted again. The faint hope that someone might hear them was frightening in itself. They paused, listening, but no answer came. Tom quickly tried to retrace their steps, hurrying along, but soon his uncertainty showed, and Becky realized with dread that he couldn’t find the way back. “Tom, you didn’t leave any marks!” she cried. “I was such a fool! I never thought we’d need to come back! I can’t find the way—it’s all mixed up.” “Tom, we’re lost! We’ll never get out! Why did we ever leave the others?” she sobbed, collapsing in despair. Tom sat beside her, holding her as she clung to him and cried in grief and fear, while their echoed voices seemed to mock them. Tom tried to comfort her, urging her not to give up hope, but she said she couldn’t. He began blaming himself for their predicament, which seemed to help; she promised to try to have hope again and follow him, as long as he stopped blaming himself, insisting it wasn’t any more his fault than hers."

For a little while, hope made a show of reviving—not with any reason to back it, but only because it is its nature to revive when the spring has not been taken out of it by age and familiarity with failure.\nBy-and-by Tom took Becky’s candle and blew it out. This economy meant so much! Words were not needed. Becky understood, and her hope died again. She knew that Tom had a whole candle and three or four pieces in his pockets—yet he must economize.\nBy-and-by, fatigue began to assert its claims; the children tried to pay attention, for it was dreadful to think of sitting down when time was grown to be so precious, moving, in some direction, in any direction, was at least progress and might bear fruit; but to sit down was to invite death and shorten its pursuit.\nAt last Becky’s frail limbs refused to carry her farther. She sat down. Tom rested with her, and they talked of home, and the friends there, and the comfortable beds and, above all, the light! Becky cried, and Tom tried to think of some way of comforting her, but all his encouragements were grown thread-bare with use, and sounded like sarcasms. Fatigue bore so heavily upon Becky that she drowsed off to sleep. Tom was grateful. He sat looking into her drawn face and saw it grow smooth and natural under the influence of pleasant dreams; and by-and-by a smile dawned and rested there. The peaceful face reflected somewhat of peace and healing into his own spirit, and his thoughts wandered away to bygone times and dreamy memories. While he was deep in his musings, Becky woke up with a breezy little laugh—but it was stricken dead upon her lips, and a groan followed it.\n“Oh, how could I sleep! I wish I never, never had waked! No! No, I don’t, Tom! Don’t look so! I won’t say it again.”\n“I’m glad you’ve slept, Becky; you’ll feel rested, now, and we’ll find the way out.”\n“We can try, Tom; but I’ve seen such a beautiful country in my dream.

For a brief moment, hope seemed to revive, not supported by any logic, but because hope naturally resurfaces unless it has been crushed by prolonged failure and the passage of time. Soon after, Tom took Becky's candle and put it out. This act of conservation was deeply significant; it required no explanation. Becky immediately understood its meaning, and her hope died once more. She was aware that Tom had other candles, yet the need for such economy indicated their dire situation. Eventually, fatigue began to assert itself forcefully. The children fought against the urge to sit down, as stopping felt dreadful when time was so critical. Moving in any direction, they felt, was progress and offered a chance of escape, while stopping felt like surrendering to death and hastening its arrival. At last, Becky's weary body could not go on. She sank down, and Tom rested with her. They spoke of home, their friends, comfortable beds, and, most of all, the luxury of light. Becky cried, and Tom tried to comfort her, but his words of encouragement had been used so often they sounded worn-out and almost mocking. Exhaustion finally overcame Becky, and she fell asleep. Tom was relieved. He watched her tired face relax and become smooth and peaceful as she experienced pleasant dreams; before long, a gentle smile appeared on her lips. Her tranquil appearance brought some peace and comfort to his own spirit, and his thoughts drifted back to old times and hazy memories. While he was lost in thought, Becky woke with a sudden, airy laugh that quickly vanished, replaced by a groan. \"Oh, how could I have slept!\" she exclaimed. \"I wish I had never, never woken up! No! No, I don't, Tom! Don't look like that! I won't say it again.\" \"I'm glad you slept, Becky,\" Tom replied. \"You'll feel rested now, and we will find our way out.\" \"We can try, Tom,\" she said, \"but I saw such a beautiful place in my dream.

For a brief period, a sense of hope seemed to return—though there was no solid reason for it, only the natural instinct for hope to reemerge when it's not yet been extinguished by long experience or repeated disappointment.\n\nAfter a time, Tom took Becky's candle and blew it out. This act of saving resources spoke volumes, needing no explanation. Becky understood what it meant and her hope faded once more. She was aware that Tom still had an unused candle and several small pieces left in his pocket, but he clearly needed to save them.\n\nSoon, exhaustion took hold; the children tried to stay alert. The thought of stopping seemed terrifying when time was so precious—moving, in any direction, at least felt like progress and might eventually lead somewhere; sitting down, however, felt like giving up and hastening the end.\n\nEventually, Becky became too tired to go on. She sat down, and Tom stopped to rest with her. They spoke about home, their loved ones, soft beds, and especially about the light. Becky began to cry, and Tom tried to reassure her, but all his words of comfort were worn out from overuse and now sounded almost mocking. Becky became so tired that she drifted into sleep. Tom felt relieved; as he watched her, her tense features softened and a gentle smile appeared as she dreamed. The tranquility of her sleeping face brought Tom a measure of peace, and his mind wandered back to old memories and daydreams. While he was lost in thought, Becky woke suddenly with a cheerful laugh, which quickly faded and was replaced by a groan.\n\n“Oh, how could I fall asleep! I wish I'd never woken up! No, Tom, I don't really wish that. Please, don’t look at me that way. I won’t say it anymore.”\n\n“I’m glad you got some rest, Becky. You’ll feel better now, and we’ll find our way out.”\n\n“We can try, Tom. I saw such a beautiful place in my dream. Maybe that’s where we’re headed.”"

The children focused on their small candle and watched it slowly and cruelly burn down. They saw the wick finally left standing alone, witnessed the weak flame rise and fall, cling to the thin smoke column briefly, and then complete, terrifying darkness took over! Neither could say how long it was before Becky slowly realized she was sobbing in Tom's embrace. All they knew was that after what felt like a vast amount of time, they both emerged from a deep, numbing sleep and their suffering resumed. Tom suggested it might be Sunday now – perhaps Monday. He tried to coax Becky into talking, but her sadness was too heavy, and all her hopes were gone. Tom speculated they must have been reported missing long ago and a search was likely underway. He thought yelling might attract someone. He attempted it, but in the darkness, the far-off echoes sounded so horrifying that he stopped. Hours passed, and hunger returned to plague the trapped children. A piece of Tom's half of the cake remained; they shared and ate it. Yet, they felt hungrier than before. The meager amount of food only intensified their craving. Eventually, Tom whispered, \"SH! Did you hear that?\" Both held their breath and listened. There was a noise like a very faint, distant shout. Tom immediately called back and, leading Becky by the hand, began carefully moving down the corridor in that direction. Soon, he listened again; the sound was heard again, seemingly a little closer. \"It's them!\" Tom exclaimed, \"They're coming! Let's go, Becky – we're safe now!\" The captives' relief was almost overwhelming. However, they had to move slowly because holes were quite common and had to be avoided. They soon encountered one and had to stop. It could be three feet deep, it could be a hundred – they certainly couldn't cross it. Tom lay down and reached as far as he could, but found no bottom. They realized they had to stay there and wait for the searchers. They listened; the distant shouting was clearly moving further away! In just a moment or two, the sounds were completely gone. The disheartening despair of it! Tom shouted until his voice was hoarse, but it was useless. He spoke encouragingly to Becky, but a long period of anxious waiting passed, and no more sounds came.",
          "paraphrase_gpt-4.1-2025-04-14": "Soon, Becky’s renewed sobbing made it clear to Tom that she was thinking the same awful thought as him—that it might take most of Sunday morning before Mrs. Thatcher realized Becky wasn’t at Mrs. Harper’s house. The children kept their eyes fixed on their dwindling candle, watching helplessly as it melted away; when only half an inch of wick remained, the weak flame flickered and finally died, leaving them in total darkness. Neither Becky nor Tom could say how long it was before Becky slowly realized she was weeping in Tom’s arms; what they did know was that after a long, deadened sleep, they awoke to their misery once more. Tom speculated that it might be Sunday now—or even Monday. He tried to get Becky to converse, but she was too overwhelmed by her sadness and hopelessness. Tom pointed out that people must have noticed their absence by now, and likely a search was underway; he tried shouting for help, but the echoes in the dark were so unsettling that he gave up. Time dragged on, their hunger grew unbearable. With just a portion of Tom’s remaining cake, they shared what they had, but it made them feel even hungrier.\n\nSuddenly, Tom hissed for silence—did Becky hear that faint shout? Both listened intently; hearing another, Tom replied, took Becky’s hand, and they tried to follow the sound down the corridor. After another faint shout, seemingly closer, Tom told Becky the rescuers were coming, and their relief was immense. Carefully, they hurried forward, but soon encountered a drop they couldn’t cross. Tom lay down and reached into the darkness, but felt no bottom; they would have to wait for help. Dishearteningly, the distant shouts faded away, so Tom called out until he was hoarse—it was in vain. He tried to stay optimistic for Becky’s sake, but after a long period of anxious waiting, they heard nothing more."

Tom believed it must be Tuesday by this time.\nNow an idea struck him. There were some side passages near at hand. It would be better to explore some of these than bear the weight of the heavy time in idleness. He took a kite-line from his pocket, tied it to a projection, and he and Becky started, Tom in the lead, unwinding the line as he groped along. At the end of twenty steps the corridor ended in a “jumping-off place.” Tom got down on his knees and felt below, and then as far around the corner as he could reach with his hands conveniently; he made an effort to stretch yet a little farther to the right, and at that moment, not twenty yards away, a human hand, holding a candle, appeared from behind a rock! Tom lifted up a glorious shout, and instantly that hand was followed by the body it belonged to—Injun Joe’s! Tom was paralyzed; he could not move. He was vastly gratified the next moment, to see the “Spaniard” take to his heels and get himself out of sight. Tom wondered that Joe had not recognized his voice and come over and killed him for testifying in court. But the echoes must have disguised the voice. Without doubt, that was it, he reasoned. Tom’s fright weakened every muscle in his body. He said to himself that if he had strength enough to get back to the spring he would stay there, and nothing should tempt him to run the risk of meeting Injun Joe again.

There were some smaller tunnels nearby. Exploring one of these seemed like a better use of time than sitting idly while the minutes crawled by. He took a kite string from his pocket, fastened it to a rock, and he and Becky set off, with Tom leading the way, letting the string out as he navigated the passage. After about twenty steps, the corridor came to a sudden drop-off. Tom knelt down and felt below, and then reached as far around the corner as he comfortably could. As he strained to reach a bit further to his right, less than twenty yards away, a human hand holding a candle emerged from behind a rock! Tom let out a loud, joyful cry, and instantly, the rest of the person appeared – it was Injun Joe! Tom was frozen, unable to move. He felt immense relief the next second when he saw the 'Spaniard' turn and flee out of sight. Tom was puzzled as to why Joe hadn't recognized his voice and come over to kill him for testifying in court. He concluded that the echoes must have distorted his voice, reasoning that this was the only explanation. The terror Tom felt sapped the strength from his body. He told himself that if he could just make it back to the spring, he would stay there and never risk encountering Injun Joe again.

He pulled out a kite string from his pocket, tied it to a rock, and led Becky into one of the passages, letting out the string behind them so they could find their way back. After about twenty steps, the tunnel stopped at a drop-off. Tom got on his knees and felt around as far as he could reach, stretching further to the right—just then, only a short distance away, he saw a human hand holding a candle come out from behind a rock! Tom cried out in excitement, and immediately the person stepped out—he realized it was Injun Joe! Tom was so shocked he couldn't move. But to his relief, Joe hurriedly ran away and disappeared. Tom was amazed Joe hadn't recognized his voice or tried to hurt him for testifying in court, but supposed the echoes in the cave had disguised it. The scare left Tom feeling weak, and he resolved that if he could just make it back to the spring, he would stay there and not risk running into Injun Joe again.

He told how he went back for Becky and broke the good news and she told him not to fret her with such stuff, for she was tired, and knew she was going to die, and wanted to. He described how he labored with her and convinced her; and how she almost died for joy when she had groped to where she actually saw the blue speck of daylight; how he pushed his way out at the hole and then helped her out; how they sat there and cried for gladness; how some men came along in a skiff and Tom hailed them and told them their situation and their famished condition; how the men didn’t believe the wild tale at first, “because,” said they, “you are five miles down the river below the valley the cave is in”—then took them aboard, rowed to a house, gave them supper, made them rest till two or three hours after dark and then brought them home.\nBefore day-dawn, Judge Thatcher and the handful of searchers with him were tracked out, in the cave, by the twine clews they had strung behind them, and informed of the great news.",

He explained how he followed two passages as far as his kite string allowed, and a third to the absolute limit of the string. Just as he was about to give up and return, he noticed a distant light that looked like sunshine. He dropped the string and felt his way towards it, pushing his head and shoulders through a small opening to find himself looking out at the vast Mississippi River flowing past. He noted that if it had been night, he wouldn't have seen that glimmer of light and wouldn't have continued exploring that path. Tom recounted going back for Becky, sharing the good news, and her initial reaction of telling him not to bother her with such talk because she was exhausted, convinced she was going to die, and wanted to. He described his efforts to persuade and comfort her, and how she was overcome with emotion, almost collapsing with joy, when she felt her way to the spot and actually saw the small blue patch of light. He detailed how he squeezed through the hole first and then helped her out, and how they sat there, weeping with relief. He told how some men passing in a small boat saw them, and Tom called out to them, explaining their situation and their desperate hunger. He mentioned the men were initially skeptical of his extraordinary story, saying it was hard to believe because they were five miles downriver from the valley where the cave was located. Nevertheless, they took them aboard, rowed to a nearby house, gave them food, allowed them to rest for several hours after dark, and finally brought them home. Before dawn the next day, Judge Thatcher and the small group of searchers with him inside the cave were found by following the twine they had unrolled behind them, and they were informed of the wonderful news.",

Tom Sawyer was in the skiff that bore Judge Thatcher.\nWhen the cave door was unlocked, a sorrowful sight presented itself in the dim twilight of the place. Injun Joe lay stretched upon the ground, dead, with his face close to the crack of the door, as if his longing eyes had been fixed, to the latest moment, upon the light and the cheer of the free world outside. Tom was touched, for he knew by his own experience how this wretch had suffered. His pity was moved, but nevertheless he felt an abounding sense of relief and security, now, which revealed to him in a degree which he had not fully appreciated before how vast a weight of dread had been lying upon him since the day he lifted his voice against this bloody-minded outcast.\nInjun Joe’s bowie-knife lay close by, its blade broken in two. The great foundation-beam of the door had been chipped and hacked through, with tedious labor; useless labor, too, it was, for the native rock formed a sill outside it, and upon that stubborn material the knife had wrought no effect; the only damage done was to the knife itself. But if there had been no stony obstruction there the labor would have been useless still, for if the beam had been wholly cut away Injun Joe could not have squeezed his body under the door, and he knew it. So he had only hacked that place in order to be doing something—in order to pass the weary time—in order to employ his tortured faculties. Ordinarily one could find half a dozen bits of candle stuck around in the crevices of this vestibule, left there by tourists; but there were none now. The prisoner had searched them out and eaten them. He had also contrived to catch a few bats, and these, also, he had eaten, leaving only their claws. The poor unfortunate had starved to death. In one place, near at hand, a stalagmite had been slowly growing up from the ground for ages, builded by the water-drip from a stalactite overhead. The captive had broken off the stalagmite, and upon the stump had placed a stone, wherein he had scooped a shallow hollow to catch the precious drop that fell once in every three minutes with the dreary regularity of a clock-tick—a dessertspoonful once in four and twenty hours. That drop was falling when the Pyramids were new; when Troy fell; when the foundations of Rome were laid; when Christ was crucified; when the Conqueror created the British empire; when Columbus sailed; when the massacre at Lexington was “news.”\nIt is falling now; it will still be falling when all these things shall have sunk down the afternoon of history, and the twilight of tradition, and been swallowed up in the thick night of oblivion. Has everything a purpose and a mission? Did this drop fall patiently during five thousand years to be ready for this flitting human insect’s need? and has it another important object to accomplish ten thousand years to come? No matter. It is many and many a year since the hapless half-breed scooped out the stone to catch the priceless drops, but to this day the tourist stares longest at that pathetic stone and that slow-dropping water when he comes to see the wonders of McDougal’s cave. Injun Joe’s cup stands first in the list of the cavern’s marvels; even “Aladdin’s Palace” cannot rival it.",
          "paraphrase_gemini-2.5-flash-preview-04-17": "Within minutes, the news had spread extensively, and a dozen boats carrying men were heading towards McDougal’s cave, followed soon after by a well-occupied ferryboat. Tom Sawyer was among those in the boat transporting Judge Thatcher. Upon unlocking the cave entrance, a sorrowful scene was revealed in the dim light within. Injun Joe lay dead on the ground, his face close to the crack by the door, appearing as though his longing gaze had been fixed, until the very end, on the light and cheer of the outside world. Tom was moved, understanding from his own experience the suffering this poor soul had endured. He felt pity, yet simultaneously experienced a profound sense of relief and security. This newfound feeling revealed to him, to a degree he had not fully comprehended before, the enormous burden of dread he had been carrying since the day he spoke out against this violent outcast. Injun Joe’s bowie knife lay nearby, its blade broken in two. He had painstakingly chipped and hacked through the large foundation beam of the door in a tedious effort, which turned out to be useless. The natural rock formed a sill just beyond the beam, and the knife had no effect on this stubborn material; the only damage was done to the knife itself. Moreover, even if the stone barrier hadn't been there and the beam completely cut through, Injun Joe would not have been able to force his body under the door, a fact he knew. Therefore, he had likely only hacked at that spot to occupy himself—to pass the weary time and engage his tortured mind. Usually, tourists left several bits of candle stuck in the crevices of this vestibule, but none were present now. The prisoner had searched them out and eaten them. He had also managed to catch a few bats, which he also ate, leaving only their claws. The poor unfortunate had succumbed to starvation. In one area nearby, a stalagmite that had been gradually growing from the ground for ages due to water dripping from a stalactite above had been broken off. The captive had placed a stone on the stump, in which he had hollowed out a shallow depression to catch the precious drops that fell with the grim regularity of a clock-tick, once every three minutes—accumulating to just a dessertspoonful over twenty-four hours. That very drop was falling when the Pyramids were built; when Troy fell; when the foundations of Rome were laid; when Christ was crucified; when the Conqueror founded the British empire; when Columbus sailed; when the massacre at Lexington was considered \"news.\" It is falling still; it will continue to fall when all these historical events have receded into the past, becoming twilight traditions, and eventually swallowed by deep oblivion. Does everything possess a purpose and a mission? Did this drop patiently fall for five thousand years just to be available for the brief need of this fleeting human? And does it have another significant objective to fulfill ten thousand years from now? It doesn't matter. It has been many, many years since the unfortunate half-breed scooped out the stone to collect the priceless drops, yet even today, tourists visiting the wonders of McDougal’s cave stare longest at that pathetic stone and the slow-dropping water.

Tom Sawyer was among those in a skiff with Judge Thatcher. Once they unlocked the cave’s entrance, they were greeted by a somber scene: Injun Joe was found dead, stretched out on the ground with his face near the crack beneath the door, as if he had been longing for the daylight and freedom outside until his last breath. Tom was moved by the sight, understanding from his own ordeal the suffering the man had gone through. Though he felt sorry for Injun Joe, Tom was also greatly relieved and felt safer now, realizing just how heavy a burden of fear he’d been carrying ever since he testified against the dangerous fugitive. Injun Joe’s broken bowie knife lay nearby, and the thick door beam had been chipped and hacked at with a lot of effort, but to no avail—there was solid rock under the door that prevented any escape, so all the work just ruined the knife. Even if the beam were cut, Injun Joe could not have fit through the gap, and he likely knew it; he just kept chipping away to occupy his time and distract his mind from his misery. Usually, tourists left bits of candle in the cave’s entrance, but Injun Joe had found and eaten all of them. He had also managed to catch and eat a few bats, leaving only their claws behind, but in the end, he starved to death. Nearby, a stalagmite had slowly formed over centuries from dripping water. Injun Joe had broken off the top and hollowed out a stone bowl to collect the precious drips, which fell so slowly—about a spoonful’s worth every twenty-four hours. These drops had been falling since ancient times—through the rise and fall of empires and all of history—and would likely keep falling far into the future, long after today’s events are forgotten. One wonders if everything in nature has a purpose—perhaps that persistent drop was meant to help Injun Joe, or maybe it has a greater role to play in the ages ahead, but it hardly matters. Years have passed since Injun Joe shaped that stone to catch the water, but visitors to McDougal’s cave still pause in front of it, moved by the story more than by any other wonder there, even rivaling the famed “Aladdin’s Palace.”"

If he had been Satan himself there would have been plenty of weaklings ready to scribble their names to a pardon-petition, and drip a tear on it from their permanently impaired and leaky water-works.",

People traveled from surrounding towns, farms, and small villages within a seven-mile radius, arriving in large numbers by boats and wagons. They came with their children and ample supplies, openly admitting they found the funeral nearly as gratifying an experience as witnessing a hanging would have been. This burial effectively put an end to one particular effort: the petition seeking a pardon for Injun Joe from the governor. That petition had garnered numerous signatures, and many emotional public gatherings had taken place. A committee composed of overly sentimental women had even been appointed, planning to dress in mourning attire and appeal tearfully to the governor, urging him to show misguided mercy and ignore his official duties. Even though Injun Joe was suspected of having murdered five residents of the village, some individuals were still willing to endorse the pardon request, depicted cynically as easily moved individuals whose eyes readily welled up with tears.",

They brought their families and supplies, admitting the funeral proved nearly as entertaining for them as an execution would have been. The funeral put an end to efforts to petition the governor for Injun Joe’s pardon, despite the fact that the petition already had many signatures, emotional meetings had been held, and a group of sentimental women had been chosen to mourn before the governor and beg him to be overly merciful and ignore his responsibilities. Although Injun Joe was thought to have killed five townspeople, it seemed that even if he had been the devil himself, there would always be some soft-hearted people who would eagerly sign a pardon and shed tears over it, thanks to their ever-flowing sympathy."

It was that very night that I follered Injun Joe to the widder’s.”\n“You followed him?”\n“Yes—but you keep mum. I reckon Injun Joe’s left friends behind him, and I don’t want ’em souring on me and doing me mean tricks.

Huck's expression grew sad. He said, \"I know what you mean. You got into Room No. 2 and didn't find anything but whiskey. Nobody told me it was you, but I just knew it had to be you as soon as I heard about that whiskey. And I knew you didn't find the money because you would have reached out to me somehow and told me, even if you kept quiet with everyone else. Tom, I've always had a feeling we would never recover that treasure.\" Tom replied, \"Actually, Huck, I didn't tell on that tavern owner. You know his tavern was normal the Saturday I went to the picnic. Don't you remember you were supposed to be watching there that night?\" \"Oh, yes!\" Huck exclaimed. \"It feels like it was a year ago. That was the exact night I followed Injun Joe to the widow's house.\" \"You followed him?\" Tom asked, surprised. \"Yes—but keep it a secret.

Huck's eyes lit up. \"Say that again, Tom.\" \"The money is in the cave!\" Tom repeated. \"Tom—promise, is this a joke, or are you serious?\" Huck asked. \"Serious, Huck—as serious as I've ever been in my life,\" Tom assured him. \"Will you come into the cave with me and help get it out?\"",

He said no one had told him who had done it, but he suspected it was Tom as soon as he heard about the whiskey, and he also figured Tom hadn’t found the money since Tom would have found a way to let Huck know.

Tom disagreed, insisting the money was never in room No. 2. Surprised, Huck asked if Tom had found a new clue about the treasure. Tom revealed that it was in the cave. Huck, wide-eyed, asked Tom to repeat it, and Tom confirmed it. Huck asked if Tom was telling the truth, and Tom swore he was. Tom asked if Huck would go with him to get the treasure."

We’ve got it now, and we’ll keep it quiet, only we’ll let Joe Harper and Ben Rogers in—because of course there’s got to be a Gang, or else there wouldn’t be any style about it. Tom Sawyer’s Gang—it sounds splendid, don’t it, Huck?”\n“Well, it just does, Tom. And who’ll we rob?”\n“Oh, most anybody. Waylay people—that’s mostly the way.”\n“And kill them?”\n“No, not always. Hive them in the cave till they raise a ransom.”\n“What’s a ransom?”\n“Money. You make them raise all they can, off’n their friends; and after you’ve kept them a year, if it ain’t raised then you kill them. That’s the general way. Only you don’t kill the women. You shut up the women, but you don’t kill them. They’re always beautiful and rich, and awfully scared. You take their watches and things, but you always take your hat off and talk polite. They ain’t anybody as polite as robbers—you’ll see that in any book. Well, the women get to loving you, and after they’ve been in the cave a week or two weeks they stop crying and after that you couldn’t get them to leave.

Are you strong enough?” “Is it far into the cave? I’ve only been on my feet for about three or four days, but I don’t think I could walk more than a mile, Tom.” “It’s about five miles in the way anyone but me would go, Huck, but there’s a much shorter path that nobody else knows about. Huck, I’ll take you straight there in a small boat. I’ll float the boat downstream and row it back all by myself. You won’t need to lift a finger.” “Let’s start right away, Tom.” “Alright.

Look at it, Huck; it’s the most secluded spot around. You must keep absolutely quiet about it.

We have it now, and we’ll keep it a secret, but we’ll let Joe Harper and Ben Rogers in—because, of course, there has to be a Gang, or it wouldn’t have any style.

We’ll ambush people—that’s generally the method.” “And kill them?” “No, not always. We’ll hold them in the cave until they arrange for a ransom.” “What’s a ransom?” “Money. You make them get as much as they can from their friends; and if it hasn’t been raised after you’ve held them for a year, then you kill them. That’s the usual procedure. Only you don’t kill the women. You confine the women, but you don’t kill them. They are always beautiful and rich, and terribly scared. You take their watches and things, but you always take off your hat and speak politely. Nobody is as courteous as robbers—you’ll see that in any book. Well, the women start to feel affection for you, and after they’ve been in the cave a week or two, they stop crying, and after that, you couldn’t get them to leave. If you tried to make them go, they’d turn right around and come back. It’s always like that in the books.” “Why, that’s really great, Tom.

You take their valuables, but you always act politely and tip your hat. No one is as polite as robbers—you see that in any book. Eventually, the women fall in love with you, and in a week or two, they stop crying and never want to leave. If you forced them out, they’d come right back. It’s always like that in the stories.\"\n\"That’s really cool, Tom. I think it’s better than being a pirate.\"\n\"Yeah, in some ways it is, since it’s closer to home, with the circus and all.\""

They toiled their way to the farther end of the tunnel, then made their spliced kite-strings fast and moved on. A few steps brought them to the spring, and Tom felt a shudder quiver all through him. He showed Huck the fragment of candle-wick perched on a lump of clay against the wall, and described how he and Becky had watched the flame struggle and expire.\nThe boys began to quiet down to whispers, now, for the stillness and gloom of the place oppressed their spirits. They went on, and presently entered and followed Tom’s other corridor until they reached the “jumping-off place.” The candles revealed the fact that it was not really a precipice, but only a steep clay hill twenty or thirty feet high.

He pointed out the small piece of candle wick resting on a clay mound against the wall, recounting for Huck how he and Becky had watched the tiny flame flicker and finally extinguish.\nThe atmosphere grew heavy, and the boys instinctively lowered their voices to whispers, oppressed by the deep quiet and darkness of the cavern. They continued on, soon entering and following another passage that Tom knew, until they reached the spot he called the 'jumping-off place.' By the light of their candles, they saw it wasn't a sheer drop as the name suggested, but rather a steep slope of clay, about twenty to thirty feet high. Tom leaned close and whispered:\n\"Now, Huck, I'm going to show you something important.\"\nHolding his candle high, he instructed:\n\"Look around that corner as far as you can. Do you see that mark? It's there—on that large rock over there—made using candle smoke.\"\n\"Tom, it's a cross!\"\n\"See? Where's your 'Number Two' now? It said 'under the cross,' remember?

They worked their way through the tunnel to its farthest point, tied together their kite-strings, and continued on. Soon they reached the spring, and Tom felt a chill go through him. He showed Huck a piece of candle-wick stuck onto a lump of clay on the wall, explaining how he and Becky had watched its light flicker and go out. \n\nThe boys started to speak in whispers because the silence and darkness of the cave weighed on them. They continued forward, following another passageway Tom knew, until they arrived at the so-called “jumping-off place.” With their candlelight, they saw that it wasn’t a real cliff, but a steep clay slope about twenty or thirty feet high. Tom quietly said, “Now I’ll show you something, Huck.” He raised his candle and told Huck to look around the corner. “Do you see that mark on the big rock over there, made with candle smoke?”\n\nHuck replied, “Tom, it looks like a cross!”\n\nTom responded, “Now, where’s your Number Two? ‘Under the cross,’ right? That’s where I saw Injun Joe hold up his candle, Huck!”\n\nHuck gazed at the mysterious mark for a moment, then nervously said, “Tom, let’s get out of here!”\n\n“What! And leave the treasure?” Tom protested.\n\n“Yes—let’s leave it. Injun Joe’s ghost must be around here, I’m sure of it.”\n\n“No, Huck, it won’t be. A ghost would haunt the place where he died—way out at the cave entrance, five miles away.”\n\nHuck disagreed. “No, Tom, ghosts stick near money. I know how they work, and you do too.”\n\nTom began to worry Huck might be right, but then he had a thought. “Listen, Huck, we’re being silly! Injun Joe’s ghost wouldn’t come near a cross!”\n\nHuck found this reassuring, and it calmed him."

I reckon we’ll climb down there and have a hunt for that box.”\nTom went first, cutting rude steps in the clay hill as he descended. Huck followed. Four avenues opened out of the small cavern which the great rock stood in. The boys examined three of them with no result. They found a small recess in the one nearest the base of the rock, with a pallet of blankets spread down in it; also an old suspender, some bacon rind, and the well-gnawed bones of two or three fowls. But there was no moneybox. The lads searched and researched this place, but in vain. Tom said:\n“He said under the cross. Well, this comes nearest to being under the cross. It can’t be under the rock itself, because that sets solid on the ground.”\nThey searched everywhere once more, and then sat down discouraged. Huck could suggest nothing. By-and-by Tom said:\n“Lookyhere, Huck, there’s footprints and some candle-grease on the clay about one side of this rock, but not on the other sides. Now, what’s that for? I bet you the money is under the rock. I’m going to dig in the clay.”\n“That ain’t no bad notion, Tom!” said Huck with animation.\nTom’s “real Barlow” was out at once, and he had not dug four inches before he struck wood.\n“Hey, Huck!—you hear that?”\nHuck began to dig and scratch now. Some boards were soon uncovered and removed. They had concealed a natural chasm which led under the rock. Tom got into this and held his candle as far under the rock as he could, but said he could not see to the end of the rift. He proposed to explore. He stooped and passed under; the narrow way descended gradually. He followed its winding course, first to the right, then to the left, Huck at his heels. Tom turned a short curve, by-and-by, and exclaimed:\n“My goodness, Huck, lookyhere!”\nIt was the treasure-box, sure enough, occupying a snug little cavern, along with an empty powder-keg, a couple of guns in leather cases, two or three pairs of old moccasins, a leather belt, and some other rubbish well soaked with the water-drip.",
          "paraphrase_gemini-2.5-flash-preview-04-17": "Tom acknowledged his oversight, agreeing that the mark resembling a cross on the rock was indeed a fortunate sign for them, and suggested they climb down to search for the box there. Tom descended first, roughing out steps in the clay hillside as he went, with Huck following close behind. The modest cave at the base of the large rock had four openings. They explored three without success. In the fourth one, closest to the rock's foundation, they discovered a small alcove containing a bed of blankets, an old suspender, some bacon rinds, and bones from a couple of chickens that had clearly been gnawed on. However, the money box was not there. The boys searched the area repeatedly but found nothing. Tom remarked that the instructions said 'under' the cross and this spot was the closest approximation, reasoning that the box couldn't be directly under the rock itself since it was solid on the ground. After another thorough search proved fruitless, they sat down feeling discouraged. Huck had no further ideas. After a pause, Tom pointed out: \"Look here, Huck, there are footprints and some melted candle wax on the clay next to one side of this rock, but not the others. Why is that? I bet the money *is* under the rock, and I'm going to start digging in the clay there.\" Huck enthusiastically responded, \"That's a great idea, Tom!\" Tom immediately pulled out his 'real Barlow' knife and began digging. He had only gone about four inches deep when he hit something wooden. \"Hey, Huck! Did you hear that?\" Huck eagerly joined in the digging and scraping. Soon, they uncovered and removed several boards, revealing a natural crack or fissure that extended beneath the rock. Tom climbed into the opening, holding his candle as far as he could into the gap, but reported he couldn't see the end of it and proposed they explore it. He ducked down and moved forward; the narrow passage sloped gently downwards. He followed its winding path, first turning right, then left, with Huck right behind him. After navigating a sharp bend, Tom suddenly exclaimed, \"My goodness, Huck, look at this!\" There, undeniably, was the treasure box, resting comfortably in a small pocket-like cavern, alongside an empty powder keg, two guns in leather cases, two or three pairs of old moccasins, a leather belt, and various other items that were quite damp from dripping water.",
          "paraphrase_gpt-4.1-2025-04-14": "\"Tom, I hadn’t thought about that before, but you’re right. That cross is lucky for us. I think we should go down there and search for the box.\" Tom went ahead, carving rough steps into the clay hill as he made his way down. Huck trailed behind. Four passages led away from the small cave beneath the large rock. The boys checked three of them but found nothing. In the passage closest to the rock’s base, they discovered a small alcove with a bedding of blankets, an old suspender, some leftover bacon rind, and several well-picked chicken bones. But there was no sign of a money box. The boys thoroughly searched the area, but it was useless. Tom remarked, “He said under the cross. Well, this spot is the closest to being under it. It can’t be beneath the actual rock, as it sits firmly on the ground.” They went over the spot again without any luck and finally sat down, feeling discouraged. Huck couldn’t think of any ideas. After some time, Tom spoke, “See here, Huck, there are footprints and some candle wax on one side of this rock’s clay, but not on the other sides. What does that mean? I bet the money is under the rock somewhere. I’m going to start digging in the clay.” “That’s a good idea, Tom!” Huck said excitedly. Tom quickly pulled out his trusty knife and had barely dug four inches before hitting something wooden. “Hey, Huck! Did you hear that?” Huck began digging and scratching, too. Soon, they uncovered and removed some boards, revealing a natural crevice that led beneath the rock. Tom crawled in and held his candle as far as he could, but couldn’t see the end of the gap. He decided they should explore further, stooping down and squeezing through the narrow passage, which sloped gradually downward, first curving right, then left, with Huck following. After turning a short bend, Tom cried out, “Wow, Huck, come look at this!” Sure enough, there was the treasure-box in a small hidden cave, along with an empty powder keg, a few guns in cases, several pairs of worn moccasins, a leather belt, and other items, all damp from dripping water."

He explained they would meet in the morning to count and divide it, and then find a safe spot for it in the woods.

I'm not sure about that. Aren't you and the widow good friends?\" \"Yes. Well, she's been good to me, anyway,\" Huck conceded. \"Alright then. Why are you afraid?\" Before Huck's slow mind could fully grasp the question, he and Tom were ushered by Mr. Jones into Mrs. Douglas's living room. Mr. Jones left the wagon by the door and followed them in. The room was brightly illuminated and contained every important person in the village. The Thatchers, the Harpers, the Rogerses, Aunt Polly, Sid, Mary, the minister, the editor, and many others were there, all dressed in their finest clothes. The widow welcomed the boys as warmly as anyone could possibly welcome two individuals looking like them. They were covered in mud and candle grease. Aunt Polly's face turned scarlet with embarrassment, and she frowned and shook her head disapprovingly at Tom. However, nobody felt half as miserable as the two boys did. Mr. Jones explained, \"Tom wasn't home yet, so I gave up on finding him there; but I happened upon him and Huck right at my doorstep, so I brought them along straight away.\" \"And you did exactly right,\" said the widow. \"Come with me, boys.\" She led them to a bedroom and instructed, \"Now, wash up and get dressed. Here are two new suits of clothes – shirts, socks, everything included. They belong to Huck – no need for thanks, Huck – Mr. Jones bought one set and I bought the other.

That’s human nature for you—let’s move it along!”\n\nCurious, the boys wondered why the rush.\n“Never you mind; you’ll find out when we get to Widow Douglas’s.”\n\nWorried, Huck said to Mr. Jones, “We didn’t do anything wrong, honest.”\n\nMr. Jones chuckled, “I’m not so sure, Huck.

Here are new clothes—shirts, socks, everything you need. They’re for you, Huck. Don’t thank me—Mr. Jones and I each bought a set. They’ll fit you both fine. Change, and come down when you’re ready.” With that, she left them."

Huck pressed, 'Now, Tom, haven't you always been supportive of me? You wouldn't really exclude me, would you, Tom? You wouldn't actually do that, would you, Tom?'
