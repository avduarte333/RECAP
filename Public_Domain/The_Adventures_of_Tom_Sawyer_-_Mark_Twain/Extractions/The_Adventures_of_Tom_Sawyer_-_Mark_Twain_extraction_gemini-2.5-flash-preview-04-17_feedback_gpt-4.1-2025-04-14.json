He got back home just in season to help Jim, the nigger boy, saw next-day's wood and split kindlings before supper. This was a fresh surprise. Tom had been planning a good lie to explain his late appearance but he had not expected the wood detail. He said to himself, \"Hold on! S'pose I tell him I been to the circus? Well, that'll be a good one. It'll fetch him sure.\"\n\nHe was going on to enlarge his plan when he came in sight of the wood-pile, and there was Jim at work, and Sid -- that's Tom's younger half-brother -- was picking up chips. Tom was a boy of spirit and enterprise, and Sid was a quiet, well-disposed boy. Sid always finished his chores, and Tom didn't.\n\nTom said to Jim, \"Say, Jim, I'll give you a marble if you'll saw some wood for me.\"\n\nJim was about to consent, but Aunt Polly's cat was in the way, and he was afraid of her. Tom said, \"She won't hurt you. I'll hold her.\"\n\nSo Jim sawed, and Tom sat on the wood-pile and talked, and told Jim all about his adventures, and how he had been to the circus, and seen the elephants and the lions and the tigers, and the clowns, and the tight-rope walkers, and the lady that rode the white horse, and the man that stood on his head on the back of a running horse, and the man that ate fire, and the man that swallowed swords, and the man that juggled with balls, and the man that balanced a feather on his nose, and the man that played the fiddle with his toes, and the man that played the banjo with his teeth, and the man that played the piano with his elbows, and the man that played the organ with his feet, and the man that played the drum with his chin, and the man that played the trumpet with his ears, and the man that played the trombone with his knees, and the man that played the flute with his nose, and the man that played the clarinet with his mouth, and the man that played the bassoon with his fingers, and the man that played the oboe with his thumbs, and the man that played the harp with his toes, and the man that played the guitar with his teeth, and the man that played the mandolin with his chin, and the man that played the violin with his ears, and the man that played the cello with his knees, and the man that played the double bass with his nose, and the man that played the banjo with his mouth, and the man that played the guitar with his fingers, and the man that played the mandolin with his thumbs, and the man that played the violin with his toes, and the man that played the cello with his teeth, and the man that played the double bass with his chin, and the man that played the banjo with his ears, and the man that played the guitar with his knees, and the man that played the mandolin with his nose, and the man that played the violin with his mouth, and the man that played the cello with his fingers, and the man that played the double bass with his thumbs, and the man that played the banjo with his toes, and the man that played the guitar with his teeth, and the man that played the mand",

He talked about how tiresome school was, and how he wished it was vacation. He said it was hot, yes, but not *that* hot.  Aunt Polly circled closer. “Well, now, Tom, ‘pears to me you’d better not run off to school and go a-swimming in such weather. It’s mighty dangerous.”  Tom felt a cold dread creep over him, but he kept his face innocent. “Didn’t go a-swimming, Aunt Polly. Didn’t go near the river.”  She looked at him intently, her eyes searching his face. “Don’t play with me, Tom. I know you went a-swimming.”  “No, ma’am, I didn’t. I went to school.”  Aunt Polly sighed, defeated for the moment on that front. But she had another trick up her sleeve. She had sewed his shirt collar with white thread that morning, a tell-tale sign if he took it off. She reached out and pulled his shirt collar towards her. Tom’s heart leaped into his throat. He had replaced the white thread with black thread! Would she notice? She examined it closely. A puzzled frown creased her brow. The thread was black. She let go, baffled. Tom breathed again. He had escaped, by the skin of his teeth and the quick work of his needle and thread. Aunt Polly was left wondering how he had managed it, but for now, the evidence was against her suspicion."

It consisted in a peculiar bird-like turn, a sort of liquid warble, produced by touching the tongue to the roof of the mouth at short intervals in the midst of the music—the reader probably remembers how to do it, if he has ever been a boy. Diligence and attention soon gave him the knack of it, and he strode down the street with his mouth full of harmony and his soul full of gratitude. He felt much as an astronomer feels who has discovered a new planet—no doubt, as far as strong, deep, unalloyed pleasure is concerned, the advantage was with the boy, not the astronomer.",

As the sun dipped below the horizon, painting the sky in hues of orange and purple, Tom Sawyer and his friends would linger outdoors, reluctant to surrender to bedtime. The air grew soft and warm, carrying the scent of honeysuckle and dust. Games of 'Injuns' or 'pirates' continued until the light faded completely, replaced by the gentle glow of stars and the occasional lamp from a distant window. Sometimes, Tom would sneak off with Huck Finn, drawn by the allure of the riverbank or the mystery of the graveyard. These twilight hours were a time for whispered secrets, daring plans, and the simple joy of being young and unbound by the day's rules. The village of St. Petersburg settled into a peaceful hum, but for Tom, the evening was just another chapter waiting to be written, often ending with a stealthy climb back into his window, hoping to avoid Aunt Polly's watchful eye."

My father’s rich as Croesus.” (A lie, of course.)\n“Well, my father he licks me if I don’t go to school.”\n“Yes, and my father he licks ME, too, if I don’t go to school—and he’s a preacher, too—the Rev. Mr. Sprague.

If you did, I’d knock the everlasting daylights out of you. Better drop that rock.”\n“No you won’t either. You ain’t going to hit me with a rock. You know you",

But neither could get an advantage. After struggling till both were hot and flushed, each relaxed his strain with watchful caution, and Tom said:\n“You’re a coward and a pup. I’ll tell my big brother on you, and he can thrash you with his little finger, and I’ll make him do it, too.”\n“What do I care for your big brother? I’ve got a brother that’s bigger than he is—and what’s more, he can throw him over that fence, too.” [Both brothers were imaginary.]\n“That’s a lie.”\n“Your saying so don’t make it so.”\nTom drew a line in the dust with his big toe, and said:\n“I dare you to step over that, and I’ll lick you till you can’t stand up.

Tom struck them to the ground. In an instant both boys were rolling and tumbling in the dirt, gripped together like cats; and for the space of a minute they tugged and tore at each other’s hair and clothes, punched and scratched each other’s nose, and covered themselves with dust and glory. Presently the confusion took form, and through the fog of battle Tom appeared, seated astride the new boy, and pounding him with his fists. “Holler ’nuff!” said he.\nThe boy only struggled to free himself.

            "A moment later, Jim is seen hastily retreating down the street with his pail, nursing a sore backside, while Tom is energetically whitewashing, and Aunt Polly is withdrawing from the scene, slipper in hand, a look of triumph on her face."

There was a song in every heart; and if the heart was young the music issued at the lips. There was cheer in every face and a spring in every step. The locust-trees were in bloom and the fragrance of the blossoms filled the air. Cardiff Hill, beyond the village and above it, was green with vegetation and it lay just far enough away to seem a Delectable Land, dreamy, reposeful, and inviting.\nTom appeared on the sidewalk with a bucket of whitewash and a long-handled brush. He surveyed the fence, and all gladness left him and a deep melancholy settled down upon his spirit. Thirty yards of board fence nine feet high. Life to him seemed hollow, and existence but a burden. Sighing, he dipped his brush and passed it along the topmost plank; repeated the operation; did it again; compared the insignificant whitewashed streak with the far-reaching continent of unwhitewashed fence, and sat down on a tree-box discouraged. Jim came skipping out at the gate with a tin pail, and singing Buffalo Gals. Bringing water from the town pump had always been hateful work in Tom’s eyes, before, but now it did not strike him so. He remembered that there was company at the pump. White, mulatto, and negro boys and girls were always there waiting their turns, resting, trading playthings, quarrelling, fighting, skylarking. And he remembered that although the pump was only a hundred and fifty yards off, Jim never got back with a bucket of water under an hour—and even then somebody generally had to go after him. Tom said:\n“Say, Jim, I’ll fetch the water if you’ll whitewash some.”\nJim shook his head and said:\n“Can’t, Mars Tom. Ole missis, she tole me I got to go an’ git dis water an’ not stop foolin’ roun’ wid anybody. She say she spec’ Mars Tom gwine to ax me to whitewash, an’ so she tole me go ’long an’ ’tend to my own business—she ’lowed she’d ’tend to de whitewashin’.”\n“Oh, never you mind what she said, Jim. That’s the way she always talks. Gimme the bucket—I won’t be gone only a a minute. She won’t ever know.”\n“Oh, I dasn’t, Mars Tom. Ole missis she’d take an’ tar de head off’n me. ’Deed she would.”\n“She! She never licks anybody—whacks ’em over the head with her thimble—and who cares for that, I’d like to know. She talks awful, but talk don’t hurt—anyways it don’t if she don’t cry. Jim, I’ll give you a marvel. I’ll give you a white alley!”\nJim began to waver.\n“White alley, Jim! And it’s a bully taw.”\n“My! Dat’s a mighty gay marvel, I tell you! But Mars Tom I’s powerful ’fraid ole missis—”\n“And besides, if you will I’ll show you my sore toe.”\nJim was only human—this attraction was too much for him. He put down his pail, took the white alley, and bent over the toe with absorbing interest while the bandage was being unwound. In another moment he was flying down the street with his pail and a tingling rear, Tom was whitewashing with vigor, and Aunt Polly was retiring from the field with a slipper in her hand and triumph in her eye.",

But now Tom noted with interest that Jim was bound for the town pump with a tin pail, and he remembered that town pumps of properly constituted towns were always surrounded by a crowd of boys, from all walks of life, white and black, who were always trading things and quarreling and fighting and skylarking. And he remembered that although the pump was only a hundred and fifty yards off, Jim never got back under an hour--and even then he was fetched by somebody. Presently, something loomed up in Tom's mind. He said:\n\n\"Say, Jim, I've a notion. You fetch the water and I'll whitewash.\" \n\nJim shook his head and said:\n\n\"Can't, Mars Tom.

The temptation was sore. He put down his pail, still irresolute. And then Tom brought out the jewel which would have finished the business. It was his sore toe, wrapped in rags. He removed the rags. One glance made the flesh crawl, and Jim's mouth watered yet more. He would have sacrificed anything to examine it. So Tom got his whitewashing done, and Jim went off skipping for water with the tin pail, and a tingling rear, and Aunt Polly was retiring from the field with a slipper in her hand and a triumphant look in her eye.",
                "refinement_prompt": "IMPROVEMENT GUIDANCE:\n1. MAJOR STRUCTURAL ISSUES:\n- In the middle of the passage, the completion invents an exchange involving an apple as a bribe, which is not present in the original. This addition changes the nature of the negotiation between Tom and Jim.\n- The completion also introduces a sequence where Tom is described as sauntering away with the pail and apple, and Jim is left whitewashing, which does not align with the original events.\n\n2. MISSING ELEMENTS:\n- Early in the passage, the completion omits the description of the social scene at the town pump, including the presence of various children and the activities that occur there. This context is important for understanding Tom's motivation.\n- The completion does not include the detail about how long it typically takes Jim to return from the pump, nor the reason why fetching water had previously seemed unpleasant to Tom but now appears more appealing.\n- The specific sequence where Tom offers to show Jim his sore toe as an additional incentive is missing, which is a key turning point in convincing Jim.\n\n3. INACCURATE ELEMENTS:\n- The completion inaccurately describes the landscape by attributing a \"Sabbath\" quality to Cardiff Hill, which is not present in the original.\n- The dialogue between Tom and Jim is altered, with some lines misattributed or changed in tone and content, such as the invented reference to a cat mewing and the apple as a bribe.\n- The sequence of actions at the end is incorrect: the completion reverses the roles of Tom and Jim regarding who is whitewashing and who is running away, and it misrepresents Aunt Polly's actions and the outcome of the exchange.\n\nOverall, the completion introduces invented elements, omits important contextual and motivational details, and alters the sequence and nature of the interactions between the characters."

Ben’s gait was the hop-skip-and-jump—proof enough that his heart was light and his anticipations high. He was eating an apple, and giving a long, melodious whoop, at intervals, followed by a deep-toned ding-dong-dong ding-dong-dong, for he was personating a steamboat. As he drew near, he slackened speed, took the middle of the street, leaned far over to starboard with a “pst!” of escaping steam, and then straightened up and steamed ahead again, chirruping till he was abreast of the boy, about fifteen feet away—then he stopped and cast anchor with a ding-dong-dong ding-dong-dong. He stood a moment wrapped in the ecstasy of the noise—Tom stood silent, handling his brush with the neatness and precision of a professional, and giving his work the 'artist finish' at every stroke. Ben stared a moment and then said: “Hi—yi! You’re up a stump, ain’t you!” No answer. Tom surveyed his last touch with the eye of an artist, then gave his brush another gentle sweep and surveyed the result, as before. Ben ranged up alongside of him. Tom’s mouth watered for the apple, but he stuck to his work. Ben said: “Hello, old chap, you got to work, hey?” Tom wheeled suddenly and exclaimed: “Why, it’s you, Ben! I warn’t noticing.” “Say—I’m going in a-swimming, I am. Don’t you wish you could? But of course you’d druther work—wouldn’t you? Course you would!” Tom contemplated the boy a bit, and said: “What do you call work?” “Why, ain’t that work?” Tom resumed his whitewashing, and answered carelessly: “Well, maybe it is, and maybe it ain’t. All I know, is, it suits Tom Sawyer.” “Oh come, now, you don’t mean to let on that you LIKE it?” The brush continued its regular sweep. “Like it? Well, I don’t see why I oughtn’t to like it. Does a boy get a chance to whitewash a fence every day?”",

She had thought that of course Tom had deserted long ago, and she wondered at seeing him place himself in her power again in this intrepid way. He said: “Mayn’t I go and play now, aunt?”\n“What, a’ready? How much have you done?”\n“It’s all done, aunt.”\n“Tom, don’t lie to me—I can’t bear it.”\n“I ain’t, aunt; it is all done.”\nAunt Polly placed small trust in such evidence. She went out to see for herself; and she would have been content to find twenty per cent. of Tom’s statement true. When she found the entire fence white-washed, and not only whitewashed but elaborately coated and recoated, and even a streak added to the ground, her astonishment was almost unspeakable. She said:\n“Well, I never! There’s no getting round it, you can work when you’re a mind to, Tom.” And then she diluted the compliment by adding, “But it’s powerful seldom you’re a mind to, I’m bound to say. Well, go ’long and play; but mind you get back some time in a week, or I’ll tan you.”\nShe was so overcome by the splendor of his achievement that she took him into the closet and selected a choice apple and delivered it to him, along with an improving lecture upon the added value and flavor a treat took to itself when it came without sin through virtuous effort. And while she closed with a happy Scriptural flourish, he “hooked” a doughnut.",

There was a gate, but as a general thing he was too crowded for time to make use of it. His soul was at peace, now that he had settled with Sid for calling attention to his black thread and getting him into trouble.\nTom skirted the block, and came round into a muddy alley that led by the back of his aunt’s cow-stable. He presently got safely beyond the reach of capture and punishment, and hastened toward the public square of the village, where two “military” companies of boys had met for conflict, according to previous appointment. Tom was General of one of these armies, Joe Harper (a bosom friend) General of the other. These two great commanders did not condescend to fight in person—that being better suited to the still smaller fry—but sat together on an eminence and conducted the field operations by orders delivered through aides-de-camp. Tom’s army won a great victory, after a long and hard-fought battle. Then the dead were counted, prisoners exchanged, the terms of the next disagreement agreed upon, and the day for the necessary battle appointed; after which the armies fell into line and marched away, and Tom turned homeward alone.",

MAJOR STRUCTURAL ISSUES:\n- The completion invents a lengthy and repetitive internal reflection that is not present in the original, especially the repeated phrase about Tom's humanity. This invented section dominates the latter part of the completion and disrupts the narrative flow.\n- The completion omits the entire sequence involving Tom's journey to the village square, the meeting of the two boy armies, the mock battle, and the aftermath, which are major events in the original passage.\n\n2. MISSING ELEMENTS:\n- The completion does not include Tom's feelings of satisfaction after his actions toward Sid, nor does it mention the reason for his peace of mind.\n- The description of Tom's route after leaving the house, including the specific locations he passes and his efforts to avoid capture, is missing.\n- The organization and activities of the two boy armies, the roles of Tom and Joe Harper, the conduct of the battle, and the post-battle rituals are all absent.\n- The final actions of the group and Tom's solitary return home are not present.\n\n3. INACCURATE ELEMENTS:\n- The sequence of events is altered: the completion adds invented details about Tom's attack on Sid, including specific actions and dialogue that do not match the original.\n- The completion misattributes actions and dialogue, such as Aunt Polly's response and Sid's reaction, which differ from the original events.\n- The invented internal monologue and emotional reflection are not accurate to the original passage's tone or content.\n- The completion fails to maintain the correct order of events, skipping directly from the initial incident to an invented reflection, omitting the intervening and concluding events."

The fresh-crowned hero fell without firing a shot. A certain Amy Lawrence vanished out of his heart and left not even a memory of herself behind. He had thought he loved her to distraction, he had thought she would love him to distraction—he had thought that when he said the word they would seek a lonely exile together and die in youth and sorrow. Yes, he had thought all this, and more, but it was only the thought of a week, and he was a light, frivolous boy, and these things would not bear weight. He had thought her the most beautiful girl in the world, and had dreamed of her every night for weeks; and she had seemed the very sun, moon, and stars to him. Ah, Amy, it was a cruel fate that removed her out of that dear home and left Tom so forlorn. And yet, when she was gone, Tom suffered less and less and finally ceased to suffer at all. He had by this time got the chief place in the girl's affections. He asked her to marry him, some day, and she said yes. She put her arm around his neck and kissed him, and they went off a mile or two hand in hand and dreaming. He thought he should never feel interest in any other girl. But his interest in this one had not been strong enough to endure the absence of a week. The new girl's name was Becky Thatcher. She was the judge's daughter, an elastic, blue-eyed creature with yellow hair plaited into two long tails, a white summer frock and embroidered pantalettes. Tom stared, charmed. It was the most bewitching creature he had ever seen. He sat down on the grass, and she came to the fence and stood there, looking at him, a moment, and then she flirted her head and turned and ran into the house. Tom heaved a sigh. He had seen a vision of loveliness. He would find out who this new girl was. He would win her. He would make her his. He would be a hero in her eyes. He would do something grand. He would be a pirate. He would be a robber. He would be a great Indian chief. He would be a famous general. He would be a great orator. He would be a great poet. He would be a great anything. He would be a great man. He would be a great man, and she would be his wife.

MISSING ELEMENTS:\n- The completion omits the detail of Tom watching the girl as she moves toward the house, his hope that she would stay longer, and his reaction as she pauses on the steps and moves toward the door.\n- The specific moment when the girl tosses the pansy over the fence before disappearing is missing; instead, the flower is found on the ground after she is gone.\n\n3. INACCURATE ELEMENTS:\n- The order of events is incorrect: in the original, Tom receives the flower directly from the girl before she disappears, but in the completion, he finds it after she has left.\n- The completion attributes additional actions and feelings to Tom, such as feeling mortified and calling himself a simpleton, which are not present in the original.\n- The description of Tom's actions and the girl's reactions are altered, with invented details about her laughing and Tom's specific gymnastic feats, which do not match the original sequence or content."

It seems as if you can't ever learn to act like anybody else's children. Look at Sid—how still he sets there, and how good he is. That's the way to get along in the world, and prosper and be respected. But you—you got to be always tearing around and raising Cain.\" By and by she flew out at Sid for tipping over his milk, and said, \"Here now! What do you mean by that, you clumsy creetur? Don't you ever see what you're doing?\" \"I couldn't help it, Aunt Polly. I was asleep.\" \"Asleep? Yes, of course you was. I reckon you'd be asleep if you was in—\" It occurred to her that remark was not happy, and so she changed the subject and said: \"Well, anyway, all I want is the peace and quietness of heaven to a body. An' I'll get it. There ain't no trouble till Tom comes. I never did see the like of that boy.\" She went on fretting just in the ordinary way, and Tom was happy to hear it, for it meant that she was not thinking about his crime, and so he could go on planning his mischief at his leisure. Presently she started up and said: \"Bless my soul! I clean forgot the coffee!\" and she hurried out into the kitchen. Tom seized the opportunity—in the twinkling of an eye he was before the sugar-bowl, a lump of sugar in his hand, and Sid's knuckles rapping his head. \"Take that!\" said Sid. Tom seized the lump of sugar and fled. Sid, smarting under his aunt's reproof, and perhaps feeling a little jealous of Tom's immunity, reached for the sugar-bowl himself. His fingers slipped, and the bowl fell and broke. Tom was in ecstasies. He saw Sid getting into trouble, and he was glad of it. He knew that Sid would be blamed for the accident, and he was delighted at the prospect of seeing him punished.",

The potent palm was uplifted to strike again when Tom cried out:\n“Hold on, now, what ’er you belting me for?—Sid broke it!”\nAunt Polly paused, perplexed, and Tom looked for healing pity. But when she got her tongue again, she only said:\n“Umf! Well, you didn’t get a lick amiss, I reckon. You been into some other audacious mischief when I wasn’t around, like enough.”\nThen her conscience reproached her, and she yearned to say something kind and loving; but she judged that this would be construed into a confession that she had been in the wrong, and discipline forbade that. So she kept silence, and went about her affairs with a troubled heart. Tom sulked in a corner and exalted his woes. He knew that in her heart his aunt was on her knees to him, and he was morosely gratified by the consciousness of it. He would hang out no signals, he would take notice of none. He knew that a yearning glance fell upon him, now and then, through a film of tears, but he refused recognition of it. He pictured himself lying sick unto death and his aunt bending over him beseeching one little forgiving word, but he would turn his face to the wall, and die with that word unsaid. Ah, how would she feel then? And he pictured himself brought home from the river, dead, with his curls all wet, and his sore heart at rest. How she would throw herself upon him, and how her tears would fall like rain, and her lips pray God to give her back her boy and she would never, never abuse him any more! But he would lie there cold and white and make no sign—a poor little sufferer, whose griefs were at an end. He so worked upon his feelings with the pathos of these dreams, that he had to keep swallowing, he was so like to choke; and his eyes swam in a blur of water, which overflowed when he winked, and ran down and trickled from the end of his nose. And such a luxury to him was this petting of his sorrows, that he could not bear to have any worldly cheeriness or any grating delight intrude upon it; it was too sacred for such contact; and so, presently, when his cousin Mary danced in, all alive with the joy of seeing home again after an age-long visit of one week to the country, he got up and moved in clouds and darkness out at one door as she brought song and sunshine in at the other.",

He waited some little time, in a sweet agony of suspense, then he stole to the fence and climbed over it cautiously, paled along through the plants and shrubs, pained his eye and scratched his hand in the dark, and so reached the “style”—that is, the propped-up fence or railing that divided Becky Thatcher’s yard from ours. He waited again; no sound. He stole to the window, and leaned against the wall under it. He listened again, perfectly still; but not a “rustle” broke the utter silence of the night. Evidently the Adored Unknown was not coming. The candle went out. He waited a little longer, discouraged, and then he turned and dejectedly crept away. And then—a pang of distress and disappointment came over him. He remembered that she was sitting next to him in school that day, and had said she would give him the box of candy she had in her pocket. He had been so absorbed in his own misery that he had forgotten all about it. He went back to the fence and climbed over it again, and crept through the plants and shrubs again, and reached the window again. He stood under it and looked up at it a long time in tearful silence, then he lay down on the ground under it, with his hands clasped upon his breast and his pansy reposing upon the clasped hands. He wailed in spirit, and said he would die there; he would freeze to death; they would find him there in the morning and she would see him and cry over him. She would say, “Poor boy, he loved me so!” and then she would kiss his lips, and they would be ice-cold. It was a sweet and sad luxury to him to see himself dead, and she bending over him and weeping. He went on dreaming and dreaming. He was so drowned in his sorrows that he did not hear a sound, and was not aware that a window above him was gently opening. Neither did he know that the Adored Unknown was not in that room, nor even in the house, but was visiting a sick friend two miles away. He was in the midst of his mournful bliss when his brown study was broken by a sudden splash of water. He sprang to his feet, dripping and astonished, and the next instant he was flying over the fence and down the street as fast as his legs could carry him. The window closed, and a gruff voice said: “There, now, you’ve got it! Take that, and learn to keep out of people’s yards!” The boy felt crushed. He was not only humiliated, but his pansy was ruined. He was so soaked that he could not get any drier by going home, so he stayed out in the rain and got soaked through and through. He was a sorry sight when he finally crept into his room at midnight, and he was a sorrier sight when he woke up in the morning, for he had a bad cold and a sore throat.

                "text": "About half-past nine or ten o’clock he came along the deserted street to where the Adored Unknown lived; he paused a moment; no sound fell upon his listening ear; a candle was casting a dull glow upon the curtain of a second-story window. He waited some little time, in a sweet agony of suspense, then he stole to the fence and climbed over it cautiously, paled along through the plants and shrubs, pained his eye and scratched his hand in the dark, and so reached the “style”—that is, the propped-up fence or railing that divided Becky Thatcher’s yard from ours. He waited again; no sound. He stole to the window, and leaned against the wall under it. He listened again, perfectly still; but not a “rustle” broke the utter silence of the night. Evidently the Adored Unknown was not coming. The candle went out. He waited a little longer, discouraged, and then he turned and dejectedly crept away. And then—a pang of distress and disappointment came over him. He remembered that she was sitting next to him in school that day, and had said she would give him the box of candy she had in her pocket. He had been so absorbed in his own misery that he had forgotten all about it. He went back to the fence and climbed over it again, and crept through the plants and shrubs again, and reached the window again. He stood under it and looked up at it a long time in tearful silence, then he lay down on the ground under it, with his hands clasped upon his breast and his pansy reposing upon the clasped hands. He wailed in spirit, and said he would die there; he would freeze to death; they would find him there in the morning and she would see him and cry over him. She would say, “Poor boy, he loved me so!” and then she would kiss his lips, and they would be ice-cold. It was a sweet and sad luxury to him to see himself dead, and she bending over him and weeping. He went on dreaming and dreaming. He was so drowned in his sorrows that he did not hear a sound, and was not aware that a window above him was gently opening. Neither did he know that the Adored Unknown was not in that room, nor even in the house, but was visiting a sick friend two miles away. He was in the midst of his mournful bliss when his brown study was broken by a sudden splash of water. He sprang to his feet, dripping and astonished, and the next instant he was flying over the fence and down the street as fast as his legs could carry him. The window closed, and a gruff voice said: “There, now, you’ve got it! Take that, and learn to keep out of people’s yards!” The boy felt crushed. He was not only humiliated, but his pansy was ruined. He was so soaked that he could not get any drier by going home, so he stayed out in the rain and got soaked through and through. He was a sorry sight when he finally crept into his room at midnight, and he was a sorrier sight when he woke up in the morning, for he had a bad cold and a sore throat. He was so sick that he had to stay in bed all day, and he was so miserable that he wished he was dead. He was so ashamed of himself that he did not want to see anyone, and he was so angry at the maid-servant that he wished she was dead. He was so disappointed that he had not seen the Adored Unknown that he wished he had never been born. He was so unhappy that he cried and cried, and he was so tired that he finally fell asleep.",

Breakfast over, Aunt Polly had family worship: it began with a prayer built from the ground up of solid courses of Scriptural quotations, welded together with a thin mortar of originality; and from the summit of this she delivered a grim chapter of the Mosaic Law, as from Sinai.\nThen Tom girded up his loins, so to speak, and went to work to “get his verses.” Sid had learned his lesson days before. Tom bent all his energies to the memorizing of five verses, and he chose part of the Sermon on the Mount, because he could find no verses that were shorter. At the end of half an hour Tom had a vague general idea of his lesson, but no more, for his mind was traversing the whole field of human thought, and his hands were busy with distracting recreations. Mary took his book to hear him recite, and he tried to find his way through the fog:\n“Blessed are the—a—a—”\n“Poor”—\n“Yes—poor; blessed are the poor—a—a—”\n“In spirit—”\n“In spirit; blessed are the poor in spirit, for they—they—”\n“Theirs—”\n“For theirs. Blessed are the poor in spirit, for theirs is the kingdom of heaven. Blessed are they that mourn, for they—they—”\n“Sh—”\n“For they—a—”\n“S, H, A—”\n“For they S, H—Oh, I don’t know what it is!”\n“Shall!”\n“Oh, shall! for they shall—for they shall—a—a—shall mourn—a—a—blessed are they that shall—they that—a—they that shall mourn, for they shall—a—shall what? Why don’t you tell me, Mary?—what do you want to be so mean for?”\n“Oh, Tom, you poor thick-headed thing, I’m not teasing you. I wouldn’t do that. You must go and learn it again. Don’t you be discouraged, Tom, you’ll manage it—and if you do, I’ll give you something ever so nice. There, now, that’s a good boy.”\n“All right! What is it, Mary, tell me what it is.”\n“Never you mind, Tom. You know if I say it’s nice, it is nice.”\n“You bet you that’s so, Mary. All right, I’ll tackle it again.”\nAnd he did “tackle it again”—and under the double pressure of curiosity and prospective gain he did it with such spirit that he accomplished a shining success. Mary gave him a brand-new “Barlow” knife worth twelve and a half cents; and the convulsion of delight that swept his system shook him to his foundations. True, the knife would not cut anything, but it was a “sure-enough” Barlow, and there was inconceivable grandeur in that—though where the Western boys ever got the idea that such a weapon could possibly be counterfeited to its injury is an imposing mystery and will always remain so, perhaps.

But Mary removed the towel and said:\n“Now ain’t you ashamed, Tom. You mustn’t be so bad. Water won’t hurt you.”\nTom was a trifle disconcerted. The basin was refilled, and this time he stood over it a little while, gathering resolution; took in a big breath and began. When he entered the kitchen presently, with both eyes shut and groping for the towel with his hands, an honorable testimony of suds and water was dripping from his face. But when he emerged from the towel, he was not yet satisfactory, for the clean territory stopped short at his chin and his jaws, like a mask; below and beyond this line there was a dark expanse of unirrigated soil that spread downward in front and backward around his neck. Mary took him in hand, and when she was done with him he was a man and a brother, without distinction of color, and his saturated hair was neatly brushed, and its short curls wrought into a dainty and symmetrical general effect. [He privately smoothed out the curls, with labor and difficulty, and plastered his hair close down to his head; for he held curls to be effeminate, and his own filled his life with bitterness.] Then Mary got out a suit of his clothing that had been used only on Sundays during two years—they were simply called his “other clothes”—and so by that we know the size of his wardrobe. The girl “put him to rights” after he had dressed himself; she buttoned his neat roundabout up to his chin, turned his vast shirt collar down over his shoulders, brushed him off and crowned him with his speckled straw hat. He now looked exceedingly improved and uncomfortable. He was fully as uncomfortable as he looked; for there was a restraint about whole clothes and cleanliness that galled him. He hoped that Mary would forget his shoes, but the hope was blighted; she coated them thoroughly with tallow, as was the custom, and brought them out. He lost his temper and said he was always being made to do everything he didn’t want to do. But Mary said, persuasively:\n“Please, Tom—that’s a good boy.”\nSo he got into the shoes snarling. Mary was soon ready, and the three children set out for Sunday-school—a place that Tom hated with his whole heart; but Sid and Mary were fond of it.",

Aunt Polly took one look at him and said: \"I knowed you'd be too lazy to wash, Tom. You've got the grime on your face yet.\" Tom looked up with the injured innocence of a martyr. \"No, Auntie, I've washed. Look at my hands.\" He held them up. They were certainly clean. \"Yes, they are clean. I don't deny that. But your face ain't.\" \"It is, Auntie. I washed it good.\" \"Come here, let me see.\" She seized him by the ear and dragged him towards the light. She examined his face critically. There was a clean streak from his nose to his chin where he had wiped, but the rest was untouched. \"I thought so,\" she said, releasing his ear with a tweak. \"You're the aggravatingest boy that ever was. Now march out and do it right this time.\" Tom grumbled and shuffled out. He knew there was no escaping it now. He went back to the bench, picked up the basin, and this time actually used the soap and water properly. He scrubbed his face and neck until they shone, then dried himself thoroughly. When he came back in, Aunt Polly inspected him again. \"That's better,\" she said, though her tone was still stern. \"Now, don't let me catch you trying to shirk your washing again.\" Breakfast was ready. Sid was already seated, looking prim and proper, having washed himself without any fuss. Mary was setting the table. The meal consisted of fried bacon, corn-pone, and coffee. Tom sat down, feeling slightly resentful but also relieved that the ordeal was over. Aunt Polly said grace, and they began to eat. Tom ate quickly, his mind already on the day's adventures. Sid ate slowly and carefully, never spilling a drop. Mary was quiet and helpful. After breakfast, it was time for the dreaded Bible verse learning. Aunt Polly believed in instilling religious knowledge in her nephews. She had a system where children who memorized and recited a certain number of verses earned tickets, and a certain number of tickets could be exchanged for a prize, usually a cheap Bible. Tom hated this. He found it incredibly difficult to memorize the verses, and even harder to keep his mind on them. Sid, of course, was excellent at it and already had a good collection of tickets. Mary was also diligent. Tom usually ended up with very few tickets, if any, relying on Sid or Mary to prompt him during recitation. This morning was no different. He stared at the page, the words blurring together, his thoughts drifting to fishing, swimming, and playing pirates. The prospect of earning a ticket seemed impossibly distant."

          "text_segment": "Sabbath-school hours were from nine to half-past ten; and then church service. Two of the children always remained for the sermon voluntarily, and the other always remained too—for stronger reasons. The church’s high-backed, uncushioned pews would seat about three hundred persons; the edifice was but a small, plain affair, with a sort of pine board tree-box on top of it for a steeple. At the door Tom dropped back a step and accosted a Sunday-dressed comrade:\n“Say, Billy, got a yaller ticket?”\n“Yes.”\n“What’ll you take for her?”\n“What’ll you give?”\n“Piece of lickrish and a fish-hook.”\n“Less see ’em.”\nTom exhibited. They were satisfactory, and the property changed hands. Then Tom traded a couple of white alleys for three red tickets, and some small trifle or other for a couple of blue ones. He waylaid other boys as they came, and went on buying tickets of various colors ten or fifteen minutes longer. He entered the church, now, with a swarm of clean and noisy boys and girls, proceeded to his seat and started a quarrel with the first boy that came handy. The teacher, a grave, elderly man, interfered; then turned his back a moment and Tom pulled a boy’s hair in the next bench, and was absorbed in his book when the boy turned around; stuck a pin in another boy, presently, in order to hear him say “Ouch!” and got a new reprimand from his teacher. Tom’s whole class were of a pattern—restless, noisy, and troublesome. When they came to recite their lessons, not one of them knew his verses perfectly, but had to be prompted all along. However, they worried through, and each got his reward—in small blue tickets, each with a passage of Scripture on it; each blue ticket was pay for two verses of the recitation. Ten blue tickets equalled a red one, and could be exchanged for it; ten red tickets equalled a yellow one; for ten yellow tickets the superintendent gave a very plainly bound Bible (worth forty cents in those easy times) to the pupil. How many of my readers would have the industry and application to memorize two thousand verses, even for a Doré Bible? And yet Mary had acquired two Bibles in this way—it was the patient work of two years—and a boy of German parentage had won four or five. He once recited three thousand verses without stopping; but the strain upon his mental faculties was too great, and he was little better than an idiot from that day forth—a grievous misfortune for the school, for on great occasions, before company, the superintendent (as Tom expressed it) had always made this boy come out and “spread himself.” Only the older pupils managed to keep their tickets and stick to their tedious work long enough to get a Bible, and so the delivery of one of these prizes was a rare and noteworthy circumstance; the successful pupil was so great and conspicuous for that day that on the spot every scholar’s heart was fired with a fresh ambition that often lasted a couple of weeks. It is possible that Tom’s mental stomach had never really hungered for one of those prizes, but unquestionably his entire being had for many a day longed for the glory and the eclat that came with it.",

The church stood at the head of a gentle slope, and was a neat, plain edifice, with a tin roof that shone gloriously in the sun. It was whitewashed, and the steeple was surmounted with a weathercock of gilded tin. The interior was bare, and homely as a barn, of course, with unpainted pews, clean, hard, upright, uncomfortable. At half-past nine the bell began to ring. Tom was in a hurry now to get his tickets. He traded a piece of licorice and a fish-hook for a yellow ticket, and got a red one for a marble. He traded about ten or fifteen minutes, and then joined the crowd of children that were pouring in. He found his seat, and was quiet for a moment or two, then he began to wriggle.

But he was patient, and he was kind, and he was gentle. He never got angry, and he never punished the children. He just talked to them, and he tried to make them understand that they were doing wrong. But they did not understand, and they did not care. They just went on doing as they pleased.

If they said ten verses correctly, they got a red ticket. If they said ten red tickets correctly, they got a yellow ticket. If they got ten yellow tickets, they got a Bible. It was a great honor to get a Bible, and it was very hard to do. It took a long time, and a great deal of work. Most of the children never got a Bible. Some of them got one, but it was very rare.

          "text_segment": "In due course the superintendent stood up in front of the pulpit, with a closed hymn-book in his hand and his forefinger inserted between its leaves, and commanded attention. When a Sunday-school superintendent makes his customary little speech, a hymn-book in the hand is as necessary as is the inevitable sheet of music in the hand of a singer who stands forward on the platform and sings a solo at a concert—though why, is a mystery: for neither the hymn-book nor the sheet of music is ever referred to by the sufferer. This superintendent was a slim creature of thirty-five, with a sandy goatee and short sandy hair; he wore a stiff standing-collar whose upper edge almost reached his ears and whose sharp points curved forward abreast the corners of his mouth—a fence that compelled a straight lookout ahead, and a turning of the whole body when a side view was required; his chin was propped on a spreading cravat which was as broad and as long as a bank-note, and had fringed ends; his boot toes were turned sharply up, in the fashion of the day, like sleigh-runners—an effect patiently and laboriously produced by the young men by sitting with their toes pressed against a wall for hours together. Mr. Walters was very earnest of mien, and very sincere and honest at heart; and he held sacred things and places in such reverence, and so separated them from worldly matters, that unconsciously to himself his Sunday-school voice had acquired a peculiar intonation which was wholly absent on week-days. He began after this fashion:\n“Now, children, I want you all to sit up just as straight and pretty as you can and give me all your attention for a minute or two. There—that is it. That is the way good little boys and girls should do. I see one little girl who is looking out of the window—I am afraid she thinks I am out there somewhere—perhaps up in one of the trees making a speech to the little birds. [Applausive titter.] I want to tell you how good it makes me feel to see so many bright, clean little faces assembled in a place like this, learning to do right and be good.” And so forth and so on. It is not necessary to set down the rest of the oration. It was of a pattern which does not vary, and so it is familiar to us all.\nThe latter third of the speech was marred by the resumption of fights and other recreations among certain of the bad boys, and by fidgetings and whisperings that extended far and wide, washing even to the bases of isolated and incorruptible rocks like Sid and Mary. But now every sound ceased suddenly, with the subsidence of Mr. Walters’ voice, and the conclusion of the speech was received with a burst of silent gratitude.\nA good part of the whispering had been occasioned by an event which was more or less rare—the entrance of visitors: lawyer Thatcher, accompanied by a very feeble and aged man; a fine, portly, middle-aged gentleman with iron-gray hair; and a dignified lady who was doubtless the latter’s wife. The lady was leading a child. Tom had been restless and full of chafings and repinings; conscience-smitten, too—he could not meet Amy Lawrence’s eye, he could not brook her loving gaze. But when he saw this small newcomer his soul was all ablaze with bliss in a moment. The next moment he was “showing off” with all his might—cuffing boys, pulling hair, making faces—in a word, using every art that seemed likely to fascinate a girl and win her applause. His exaltation had but one alloy—the memory of his humiliation in this angel’s garden—and that record in sand was fast washing out, under the waves of happiness that were sweeping over it now.",

It was Judge Thatcher, Tom Sawyer’s Judge, and he was accompanied by some new arrivals who were visiting him from abroad. One was a fine, portly, middle-aged gentleman with iron-gray hair and a pleasant face, of an intellectual cast, a lawyer, and a legislator. His wife was with him, and so was their little daughter, a blue-eyed creature with a coronet of golden hair and a face that was sweet and lovely. Tom Sawyer was restless and full of mischief. He had been feeling conscience-stricken, and had been trying to avoid Amy Lawrence’s eye, but he was instantly captivated by the sight of the newcomer. His soul was filled with bliss, and he immediately began to show off by misbehaving—cuffing boys, pulling hair, and making faces—in an attempt to impress her and win her admiration.

The middle-aged man turned out to be a prodigious personage—no less a one than the county judge—altogether the most august creation these children had ever looked upon—and they wondered what kind of material he was made of—and they half wanted to hear him roar, and were half afraid he might, too. He was from Constantinople, twelve miles away—so he had travelled, and seen the world—these very eyes had looked upon the county court-house—which was said to have a tin roof. The awe which these reflections inspired was attested by the impressive silence and the ranks of staring eyes. This was the great Judge Thatcher, brother of their own lawyer. Jeff Thatcher immediately went forward, to be familiar with the great man and be envied by the school. It would have been music to his soul to hear the whisperings:\n“Look at him, Jim! He’s a going up there. Say—look! he’s a going to shake hands with him—he is shaking hands with him! By jings, don’t you wish you was Jeff?”\nMr. Walters fell to “showing off,” with all sorts of official bustlings and activities, giving orders, delivering judgments, discharging directions here, there, everywhere that he could find a target. The librarian “showed off”—running hither and thither with his arms full of books and making a deal of the splutter and fuss that insect authority delights in. The young lady teachers “showed off”—bending sweetly over pupils that were lately being boxed, lifting pretty warning fingers at bad little boys and patting good ones lovingly. The young gentlemen teachers “showed off” with small scoldings and other little displays of authority and fine attention to discipline—and most of the teachers, of both sexes, found business up at the library, by the pulpit; and it was business that frequently had to be done over again two or three times (with much seeming vexation). The little girls “showed off” in various ways, and the little boys “showed off” with such diligence that the air was thick with paper wads and the murmur of scufflings. And above it all the great man sat and beamed a majestic judicial smile upon all the house, and warmed himself in the sun of his own grandeur—for he was “showing off,” too.",

This was a thunderbolt out of a clear sky. Walters was not expecting an application from this source for the next ten years. But there was no getting around it—here were the certified checks, and they were good for their face. Tom was therefore elevated to a place with the Judge and the other elect, and the great news was announced from headquarters. It was the most stunning surprise of the decade, and so profound was the sensation that it lifted the new hero up to the judicial one’s altitude, and the school had two marvels to gaze upon in place of one. The boys were all eaten up with envy—but those that suffered the bitterest pangs were those who perceived too late that they themselves had contributed to this hated splendor by trading tickets to Tom for the wealth he had amassed in selling whitewashing privileges. These despised themselves, as being the dupes of a wily fraud, a guileful snake in the grass.\nThe prize was delivered to Tom with as much effusion as the superintendent could pump up under the circumstances; but it lacked somewhat of the true gush, for the poor fellow’s instinct taught him that there was a mystery here that could not well bear the light, perhaps; it was simply preposterous that this boy had warehoused two thousand sheaves of Scriptural wisdom on his premises—a dozen would strain his capacity, without a doubt.\nAmy Lawrence was proud and glad, and she tried to make Tom see it in her face—but he wouldn’t look. She wondered; then she was just a grain troubled; next a dim suspicion came and went—came again; she watched; a furtive glance told her worlds—and then her heart broke, and she was jealous, and angry, and the tears came and she hated everybody.

And now you wouldn’t mind telling me and this lady some of the things you’ve learned—no, I know you wouldn’t—for we are proud of little boys that learn. Now, no doubt you know the names of all the twelve disciples. Won’t you tell us the names of the first two that were appointed?”\nTom was tugging at a button-hole and looking sheepish. He blushed, now, and his eyes fell. Mr. Walters’ heart sank within him. He said to himself, it is not possible that the boy can answer the simplest question—why did the Judge ask him? Yet he felt obliged to speak up and say:\n“Answer the gentleman, Thomas—don’t be afraid.”\nTom still hung fire.\n“Now I know you’ll tell me,” said the lady. “The names of the first two disciples were—”\n“David and Goliah!”\nLet us draw the curtain of charity over the rest of the scene.",

That is what this boy has been doing. And I am very proud of him. And what is more, I am very proud of you all. I see that every boy and girl present has been doing the same. That is right. Go on in the way you are going.

And let every boy and every girl remember that knowledge is power, and that truth is mighty and will prevail. And let every boy and every girl remember that by diligence and perseverance, by hard work and close application, he or she may become what he or she desires to become.

The crowd filed up the aisles: the aged and needy postmaster, who had seen better days; the mayor and his wife—for they had a mayor there, among other unnecessaries; the justice of the peace; the widow Douglas, fair, smart, and forty, a generous, good-hearted soul and well-to-do, her hill mansion the only palace in the town, and the most hospitable and much the most lavish in the matter of festivities that St. Petersburg could boast; the bent and venerable Major and Mrs. Ward; lawyer Riverson, the new notable from a distance; next the belle of the village, followed by a troop of lawn-clad and ribbon-decked young heart-breakers; then all the young clerks in town in a body—for they had stood in the vestibule sucking their cane-heads, a circling wall of oiled and simpering admirers, till the last girl had run their gantlet; and last of all came the Model Boy, Willie Mufferson, taking as heedful care of his mother as if she were cut glass. He always brought his mother to church, and was the pride of all the matrons. The boys all hated him, he was so good. And besides, he had been “thrown up to them” so much. His white handkerchief was hanging out of his pocket behind, as usual on Sundays—accidentally. Tom had no handkerchief, and he looked upon boys who had as snobs.",

At church “sociables” he was always called upon to read poetry; and when he was through, the ladies would lift up their hands and let them fall helplessly in their laps, and “wall” their eyes, and shake their heads, as much as to say, “Words cannot express it; it is too beautiful, TOO beautiful for this mortal earth.”\nAfter the hymn had been sung, the Rev.

The choir always tittered and whispered all through service. There was once a church choir that was not ill-bred, but I have forgotten where it was, now. It was a great many years ago, and I can scarcely remember anything about it, but I am sure it was not in this country. The minister gave out the hymn, and did it with two-thirds of his nose and the balance of his lungs, and a husky strain or two of vocal music. The choir attacked it with a vast war whoop, and the minister got out of their way and stood aloof until it was over. Then he fell to prayer. It was a good, generous prayer, and went into detail: it pleaded for the church, and the little children of the church; for the other churches of the village; for the village itself; for the county; for the State; for the United States; for the civilised world; for the heathen who sat in darkness. Thrice he repeated \"bless us and keep us\" in the course of his prayer, and yet seemed not satisfied, but took it up twice more after that. It was nearly two hours long, and the congregation fidgeted and moaned, and sighed, and only the minister rolled on, serenely unconscious of their sufferings. At last he concluded with \"Amen,\" and the organ burst forth with a great voluntary, into which the choir blended with enthusiastic hallelujahs. The minister then read from the Bible, and picked out the movingest passages and rendered them with effect. He strode here and there down the aisle, and up again, clanking his rusty old tin dipper along the pew tops, and catching pennies and dimes and quarters in it from the congregation, for missionary purposes. About once a month he would do this. After that came the sermon. The minister was a good man, and had a good heart, and not a mean bone in his body, but he was dreadfully long-winded. He read his sermon, which was written on foolscap paper, and it was so long that it took him an hour and a half to read it. He was a good reader, though, and had a fine voice, and he read with a great deal of expression. He would begin in a low voice, and then gradually raise it, until he was almost shouting, and then he would suddenly drop it down again, and speak in a whisper. He was very much admired for his reading, and was often asked to read poetry at social gatherings, where he would make the ladies cry. After the sermon, he gave out the notices. There were a great many of them, for meetings and societies and so forth, and he read them all, one after another, in a monotonous voice. It was a custom in that church to give out the notices after the sermon, and it was a custom that was very hard to break. The minister had tried to break it, but the congregation would not let him. They said it was a good custom, and they liked it. The minister said it was a bad custom, and he did not like it. But the congregation was too strong for him, and he had to give in. He said that the less justification a custom had, the harder it was to get rid of it. And he was right. There are a great many customs in this world that have no justification, and yet they are very hard to get rid of. For instance, there is the custom of wearing black clothes at funerals. There is no reason for it, and yet it is very hard to get rid of. There is the custom of shaking hands when you meet a person. There is no reason for it, and yet it is very hard to get rid of it. There is the custom of saying \"How do you do?\" when you meet a person. There is no reason for it, and yet it is very hard to get rid of it. There is the custom of eating three meals a day. There is no reason for it, and yet it is very hard to get rid of it. There is the custom of sleeping eight hours a night. There is no reason for it, and yet it is very hard to get rid of it. There is the custom of working eight hours a day. There is no reason for it, and yet it is very hard to get rid of it. There is the custom of going to church on Sunday. There is no reason for it, and yet it is very hard to get rid of it. There is the custom of believing in God. There is no reason for it, and yet it is very hard to get rid of it. There is the custom of believing in the devil. There is no reason for it, and yet it is very hard to get rid of it. There is the custom of believing in heaven. There is no reason for it, and yet it is very hard to get rid of it. There is the custom of believing in hell. There is no reason for it, and yet it is very hard to get rid of it.

He would begin in a low voice, and then gradually raise it, until he was almost shouting, and then he would suddenly drop it down again, and speak in a whisper. He was very much admired for his reading, and was often asked to read poetry at social gatherings, where he would make the ladies cry. After the sermon, he gave out the notices. There were a great many of them, for meetings and societies and so forth, and he read them all, one after another, in a monotonous voice. It was a custom in that church to give out the notices after the sermon, and it was a custom that was very hard to break. The minister had tried to break it, but the congregation would not let him. They said it was a good custom, and they liked it. The minister said it was a bad custom, and he did not like it. But the congregation was too strong for him, and he had to give in. He said that the less justification a custom had, the harder it was to get rid of it. And he was right. There are a great many customs in this world that have no justification, and yet they are very hard to get rid of. For instance, there is the custom of wearing black clothes at funerals. There is no reason for it, and yet it is very hard to get rid of. There is the custom of shaking hands when you meet a person. There is no reason for it, and yet it is very hard to get rid of it. There is the custom of saying \"How do you do?\" when you meet a person. There is no reason for it, and yet it is very hard to get rid of it. There is the custom of eating three meals a day. There is no reason for it, and yet it is very hard to get rid of it. There is the custom of sleeping eight hours a night. There is no reason for it, and yet it is very hard to get rid of it. There is the custom of working eight hours a day. There is no reason for it, and yet it is very hard to get rid of it. There is the custom of going to church on Sunday. There is no reason for it, and yet it is very hard to get rid of it. There is the custom of believing in God. There is no reason for it, and yet it is very hard to get rid of it. There is the custom of believing in the devil. There is no reason for it, and yet it is very hard to get rid of it. There is the custom of believing in heaven. There is no reason for it, and yet it is very hard to get rid of it. There is the custom of believing in hell. There is no reason for it, and yet it is very hard to get rid of it. There is the custom of believing in angels. There is no reason for it, and",

Amen.\nThere was a rustling of dresses, and the standing congregation sat down. The boy whose history this book relates did not enjoy the prayer, he only endured it—if he even did that much. He was restive all through it; he kept tally of the details of the prayer, unconsciously—for he was not listening, but he knew the ground of old, and the clergyman’s regular route over it—and when a little trifle of new matter was interlarded, his ear detected it and his whole nature resented it; he considered additions unfair, and scoundrelly. In the midst of the prayer a fly had lit on the back of the pew in front of him and tortured his spirit by calmly rubbing its hands together, embracing its head with its arms, and polishing it so vigorously that it seemed to almost part company with the body, and the slender thread of a neck was exposed to view; scraping its wings with its hind legs and smoothing them to its body as if they had been coat-tails; going through its whole toilet as tranquilly as if it knew it was perfectly safe. As indeed it was; for as sorely as Tom’s hands itched to grab for it they did not dare—he believed his soul would be instantly destroyed if he did such a thing while the prayer was going on. But with the closing sentence his hand began to curve and steal forward; and the instant the “Amen” was out the fly was a prisoner of war. His aunt detected the act and made him let it go.",

It was a large black beetle with formidable jaws—a “pinchbug,” he called it. It was in a percussion-cap box. The first thing the beetle did was to take him by the finger. A natural fillip followed, the beetle went floundering into the aisle and lit on its back, and the hurt finger went into the boy’s mouth. The beetle lay there working its helpless legs, unable to turn over. Tom eyed it, and longed for it; but it was safe out of his reach. Other people uninterested in the sermon found relief in the beetle, and they eyed it too. Presently a vagrant poodle dog came idling along, sad at heart, lazy with the summer softness and the quiet, weary of captivity, sighing for change. He spied the beetle; the drooping tail lifted and wagged. He surveyed the prize; walked around it; smelt at it from a safe distance; walked around it again; grew bolder, and took a closer smell; then lifted his lip and made a gingerly snatch at it, just missing it; made another, and another; began to enjoy the diversion; subsided to his stomach with the beetle between his paws, and continued his experiments; grew weary at last, and then indifferent and absent-minded. His head nodded, and little by little his chin descended and touched the enemy, who seized it. There was a sharp yelp, a flirt of the poodle’s head, and the beetle fell a couple of yards away, and lit on its back once more. The neighboring spectators shook with a gentle inward joy, several faces went behind fans and hand-kerchiefs, and Tom was entirely happy. The dog looked foolish, and probably felt so; but there was resentment in his heart, too, and a craving for revenge. So he went to the beetle and began a wary attack on it again; jumping at it from every point of a circle, lighting with his fore-paws within an inch of the creature, making even closer snatches at it with his teeth, and jerking his head till his ears flapped again. But he grew tired once more, after a while; tried to amuse himself with a fly but found no relief; followed an ant around, with his nose close to the floor, and quickly wearied of that; yawned, sighed, forgot the beetle entirely, and sat down on it. Then there was a wild yelp of agony and the poodle went sailing up the aisle; the yelps continued, and so did the dog; he crossed the house in front of the altar; he flew down the other aisle; he crossed before the doors; he clamored up the home-stretch; his anguish grew with his progress, till presently he was but a woolly comet moving in its orbit with the gleam and the speed of light. At last the frantic sufferer sheered from its course, and sprang into its master’s lap; he flung it out of the window, and the voice of distress quickly thinned away and died in the distance.",

He dropped it quickly, and it lit right side up on the floor. It remained for a moment or two, and then started on a journey straight along the aisle. It was interesting, and Tom's feelings were entirely changed. He put his hand on his chin, and leaned his body and head till they were just above the back of the pew before him, and gazed down upon the beetle, and watched, with breathless interest, the enterprise of the sturdy insect. It travelled slowly along, not much larger than a **darning-needle**'s point. It presently halted; the preacher stopped in the middle of a sentence and stood motionless; the whole congregation held its breath in solicitude. The preacher waited till the beetle obtained a good start again, and then he resumed his sermon. Tom looked up and saw that his father and mother and sister were all gazing down upon the beetle, too. They were so intently interested that they did not think of Tom. There was a just perceptible motion of the beetle's legs, but otherwise he was motionless; waiting, Tom thought. Presently he moved again; then stopped again. Then he picked up courage and made a start for good. Along he came, taking no notice of anything, his progress interrupted only by occasional sandy places that slid from under his feet, and caused him to scuffle mightily to regain a footing. He was getting dangerously near to where Tom sat, and Tom was suffering again; not suffering from boredom, but with a generous and unselfish solicitude for the beetle; he hoped with all his fervent soul, that it would not prefer to journey in his direction, and so he put out his foot for the beetle to feel, and hoped it would take a hint and steer clear. The beetle paused, for a moment, and then turned the other way. Tom's heart swelled with gratitude. When he reached the middle of the aisle, he stopped once more, and resumed business at the old stand. In the meantime, a **small** **dog** came sauntering along. He was in rather poor condition, had had an unfortunate time of it, and needed rest and recreation. He halted near the beetle, **gazed** at him thoughtfully, and then sat down. A **gentle** **wind** moved the beetle's legs a little. Instantly the dog showed interest. He pricked up his ears, put his head on one side, and scratched his nose with his hind foot. He then put his front paws together, with his nose between them, and began to **gaze** at the beetle again. Some thoughtless **fly** came buzzing by, and the dog **gazed** at him, with half an eye, and **gazed** at the beetle with the other half. Then he laid his ears back, **sighed** a **deep** **sigh**, and got up and walked away. Presently, he came back to the beetle, and **gazed** at him again. He **sighed** once more, and then picked him up in his mouth and walked off with him to his place under the pew. Tom's heart was full of gratitude. The dog laid the beetle down, and **gazed** at him, and the beetle **gazed** at the dog. Then the dog put his nose down, and sniffed at the beetle. The beetle did not like the smell, and he moved away. The dog followed him, and sniffed at him again. The beetle moved away again, and the dog followed him again.

He put his hand on his chin, and leaned his body and head till they were just above the back of the pew before him, and gazed down upon the beetle, and watched, with breathless interest, the enterprise of the sturdy insect. It travelled slowly along, not much larger than a **darning-needle**'s point. It presently halted; the preacher stopped in the middle of a sentence and stood motionless; the whole congregation held its breath in solicitude. The preacher waited till the beetle obtained a good start again, and then he resumed his sermon. Tom looked up and saw that his father and mother and sister were all gazing down upon the beetle, too. They were so intently interested that they did not think of Tom. There was a just perceptible motion of the beetle's legs, but otherwise he was motionless; waiting, Tom thought. Presently he moved again; then stopped again. Then he picked up courage and made a start for good. Along he came, taking no notice of anything, his progress interrupted only by occasional sandy places that slid from under his feet, and caused him to scuffle mightily to regain a footing. He was getting dangerously near to where Tom sat, and Tom was suffering again; not suffering from boredom, but with a generous and unselfish solicitude for the beetle; he hoped with all his fervent soul, that it would not prefer to journey in his direction, and so he put out his foot for the beetle to feel, and hoped it would take a hint and steer clear. The beetle paused, for a moment, and then turned the other way. Tom's heart swelled with gratitude. When he reached the middle of the aisle, he stopped once more, and resumed business at the old stand. In the meantime, a **small** **dog** came sauntering along. He was in rather poor condition, had had an unfortunate time of it, and needed rest and recreation. He halted near the beetle, **gazed** at him thoughtfully, and then sat down. A **gentle** **wind** moved the beetle's legs a little. Instantly the dog showed interest. He pricked up his ears, put his head on one side, and scratched his nose with his hind foot. He then put his front paws together, with his nose between them, and began to **gaze** at the beetle again. Some thoughtless **fly** came buzzing by, and the dog **gazed** at him, with half an eye, and **gazed** at the beetle with the other half. Then he laid his ears back, **sighed** a **deep** **sigh**, and got up and walked away. Presently, he came back to the beetle, and **gazed** at him again. He **sighed** once more, and then picked him up in his mouth and walked off with him to his place under the pew. Tom's heart was full of gratitude. The dog laid the beetle down, and **gazed** at him, and the beetle **gazed** at the dog. Then the dog put his nose down, and sniffed at the beetle. The beetle did not like the smell, and he moved away. The dog followed him, and sniffed at him again. The beetle moved away again, and the dog followed him again.

MISSING ELEMENTS:\n- The completion omits the detail about the sermon being resumed after the interruption, and how it continued in a diminished manner.\n- There is no mention of the ongoing, repeated reactions from the congregation during the resumed sermon, specifically the recurring bursts of laughter from hidden spots.\n- The sense of the loss of impressiveness and the impact on the sermon’s tone is not fully conveyed.\n\n3. INACCURATE ELEMENTS:\n- The sequence of events is altered: the original describes the sermon resuming and continuing awkwardly, while the completion suggests the minister gives up and ends the service abruptly.\n- The emotional response of the congregation is inaccurately portrayed; the original emphasizes a collective relief at the end, but the completion adds a physical action (filing out) that is not present.\n- The completion attributes a sense of helplessness and a decision to end the sermon to the minister, which is not specified in the original."

                "refinement_prompt": "IMPROVEMENT GUIDANCE:\n1. MAJOR STRUCTURAL ISSUES:\n- The completion introduces invented dialogue and actions, such as calling for a doctor and mentioning a thimble, which are not present in the original passage.\n- There is an added reflection about Tom moaning and thinking he must die, which is not part of the original sequence.\n- The completion omits the original's clear transition from the toe complaint to the tooth complaint, instead blending the two with extra invented dialogue.\n\n2. MISSING ELEMENTS:\n- The completion does not include the original's specific exchange where Tom admits he didn't notice his tooth pain because of his toe, which is an important step in the progression of the conversation.\n- The original's sequence where Aunt Polly directly addresses Tom's attempt to avoid school is shortened and lacks some of the emotional nuance and reasoning present in the source.\n- The completion omits the detail of Aunt Polly's instructions to Mary to get a chunk of fire, instead using a \"piece of burning coal,\" which is a less precise description.\n\n3. INACCURATE ELEMENTS:\n- The completion inaccurately attributes certain lines and actions, such as Aunt Polly telling Tom to \"fetch me my thimble\" and suggesting to \"call the doctor,\" which do not occur in the original.\n- The sequence of events is altered: the transition from the toe to the tooth complaint is less clear, and the emotional responses are rearranged or replaced with invented lines.\n- The description of the dental procedure is slightly inaccurate, with the completion adding Tom jerking his head back, which is not specified in the original.\n- The completion changes Aunt Polly's emotional tone and the way she expresses her affection and frustration, making it less consistent with the original passage's structure and intent."

As Tom wended to school after breakfast, he was the envy of every boy he met because the gap in his upper row of teeth enabled him to expectorate in a new and admirable way. He gathered quite a following of lads interested in the exhibition; and one that had cut his finger and had been a centre of fascination and homage up to this time, now found himself suddenly without an adherent, and shorn of his glory. His heart was heavy, and he said with a disdain which he did not feel that it wasn’t anything to spit like Tom Sawyer; but another boy said, “Sour grapes!” and he wandered away a dismantled hero.\nShortly Tom came upon the juvenile pariah of the village, Huckleberry Finn, son of the town drunkard. Huckleberry was cordially hated and dreaded by all the mothers of the town, because he was idle and lawless and vulgar and bad—and because all their children admired him so, and delighted in his forbidden society, and wished they dared to be like him. Tom was like the rest of the respectable boys, in that he envied Huckleberry his gaudy outcast condition, and was under strict orders not to play with him. So he played with him every time he got a chance. Huckleberry was always dressed in the cast-off clothes of full-grown men, and they were in perennial bloom and fluttering with rags. His hat was a vast ruin with a wide crescent lopped out of its brim; his coat, when he wore one, hung nearly to his heels and had the rearward buttons far down the back; but one suspender supported his trousers; the seat of the trousers bagged low and contained nothing, the fringed legs dragged in the dirt when not rolled up.\nHuckleberry came and went, at his own free will. He slept on doorsteps in fine weather and in empty hogsheads in wet; he did not have to go to school or to church, or call any being master or obey anybody; he could go fishing or swimming when and where he chose, and stay as long as it suited him; nobody forbade him to fight; he could sit up as late as he pleased; he was always the first boy that went barefoot in the spring and the last to resume leather in the fall; he never had to wash, nor put on clean clothes; he could swear wonderfully. In a word, everything that goes to make life precious that boy had. So thought every harassed, hampered, respectable boy in St. Petersburg.",

Cure warts with.”\n“No! Is that so? I know something that’s better.”\n“I bet you don’t. What is it?”\n“Why, spunk-water.”\n“Spunk-water! I wouldn’t give a dern for spunk-water.”\n“You wouldn’t, wouldn’t you? D’you ever try it?”\n“No, I hain’t. But Bob Tanner did.”\n“Who told you so!”\n“Why, he told Jeff Thatcher, and Jeff told Johnny Baker, and Johnny told Jim Hollis, and Jim told Ben Rogers, and Ben told a nigger, and the nigger told me. There now!”\n“Well, what of it? They’ll all lie. Leastways all but the nigger. I don’t know him. But I never see a nigger that wouldn’t lie. Shucks! Now you tell me how Bob Tanner done it, Huck.”\n“Why, he took and dipped his hand in a rotten stump where the rain-water was.”\n“In the daytime?”\n“Certainly.”\n“With his face to the stump?”\n“Yes. Least I reckon so.”\n“Did he say anything?”\n“I don’t reckon he did. I don’t know.”\n“Aha! Talk about trying to cure warts with spunk-water such a blame fool way as that! Why, that ain’t a-going to do any good. You got to go all by yourself, to the middle of the woods, where you know there’s a spunk-water stump, and just as it’s midnight you back up against the stump and jam your hand in and say:\n‘Barley-corn, barley-corn, injun-meal shorts,\nSpunk-water, spunk-water, swaller these warts,’\nand then walk away quick, eleven steps, with your eyes shut, and then turn around three times and walk home without speaking to anybody. Because if you speak the charm’s busted.”\n“Well, that sounds like a good way; but that ain’t the way Bob Tanner done.”\n“No, sir, you can bet he didn’t, becuz he’s the wartiest boy in this town; and he wouldn’t have a wart on him if he’d knowed how to work spunk-water. I’ve took off thousands of warts off of my hands that way, Huck. I play with frogs so much that I’ve always got considerable many warts. Sometimes I take ’em off with a bean.”\n“Yes, bean’s good. I’ve done that.”\n“Have you? What’s your way?”\n“You take and split the bean, and cut the wart so as to get some blood, and then you put the blood on one piece of the bean and take and dig a hole and bury it ’bout midnight at the crossroads in the dark of the moon, and then you burn up the rest of the bean. You see that piece that’s got the blood on it will keep drawing and drawing, trying to fetch the other piece to it, and so that helps the blood to draw the wart, and pretty soon off she comes.”\n“Yes, that’s it, Huck—that’s it; though when you’re burying it if you say ‘Down bean; off wart; come no more to bother me!’ it’s better. That’s the way Joe Harper does, and he’s been nearly to Coonville and most everywheres. But say—how do you cure ’em with dead cats?”\n“Why, you take your cat and go and get in the grave-yard ’long about midnight when somebody that was wicked has been buried; and when it’s midnight a devil will come, or maybe two or three, but you can’t see ’em, you can only hear something like the wind, or maybe hear ’em talk; and when they’re taking that feller away, you heave your cat after ’em and say, ‘Devil follow corpse, cat follow devil, warts follow cat, I’m done with ye!’ That’ll fetch any wart.”\n“Sounds right. D’you ever try it, Huck?”\n“No, but old Mother Hopkins told me.”\n“Well, I reckon it’s so, then. Becuz they say she’s a witch.”\n“Say! Why, Tom, I know she is. She witched pap. Pap says so his own self. He come along one day, and he see she was a-witching him, so he took up a rock, and if she hadn’t dodged, he’d a got her. Well, that very night he rolled off’n a shed wher’ he was a layin drunk, and broke his arm.”\n“Why, that’s awful. How did he know she was a-witching him?”\n“Lord, pap can tell, easy. Pap says when they keep looking at you right stiddy, they’re a-witching you. Specially if they mumble. Becuz when they mumble they’re saying the Lord’s Prayer backards.”\n“Say, Hucky, when you going to try the cat?”\n“To-night. I reckon they’ll come after old Hoss Williams to-night.”\n“But they buried him Saturday. Didn’t they get him Saturday night?”\n“Why, how you talk! How could their charms work till midnight?—and then it’s Sunday. Devils don’t slosh around much of a Sunday, I don’t reckon.”\n“I never thought of that. That’s so. Lemme go with you?”\n“Of course—if you ain’t afeard.”\n“Afeard! ’Tain’t likely. Will you meow?”\n“Yes—and you meow back, if you get a chance. Last time, you kep’ me a-meowing around till old Hays went to throwing rocks at me and says ‘Dern that cat!’ and so I hove a brick through his window—but don’t you tell.”\n“I won’t. I couldn’t meow that night, becuz auntie was watching me, but I’ll meow this time. Say—what’s that?”\n“Nothing but a tick.”\n“Where’d you get him?”\n“Out in the woods.”\n“What’ll you take for him?”\n“I don’t know. I don’t want to sell him.”\n“All right. It’s a mighty small tick, anyway.”\n“Oh, anybody can run a tick down that don’t belong to them. I’m satisfied with it. It’s a good enough tick for me.”\n“Sho, there’s ticks a plenty. I could have a thousand of ’em if I wanted to.”\n“Well, why don’t you? Becuz you know mighty well you can’t. This is a pretty early tick, I reckon. It’s the first one I’ve seen this year.”\n“Say, Huck—I’ll give you my tooth for him.”\n“Less see it.”\nTom got out a bit of paper and carefully unrolled it. Huckleberry viewed it wistfully. The temptation was very strong. At last he said:\n“Is it genuwyne?”\nTom lifted his lip and showed the vacancy.\n“Well, all right,” said Huckleberry, “it’s a trade.”\nTom enclosed the tick in the percussion-cap box that had lately been the pinchbug’s prison, and the boys separated, each feeling wealthier than before.",

Sells them bladder to swell the boys up?”\n“Yes; and they bust it with a yell, and that makes ’em laugh.”\n“Well, that’s a good way to git bladders. What do you want with the cat?”\n“To cure warts with.”\n“Why, you can cure ’em with spunk-water, can’t you?”\n“Yes, I’ve tried that, but it a’n’t no good.

What kind of a cat is it?”\n“Black cat, with a white spot on his nose.”\n“Is that better than a spunk-water cure?”\n“Well, I don’t know. Some says spunk-water is best, and some says dead cat. I’ve tried both, and I reckon the dead cat is best. Leastways, it’s the most fun.”\n“Say, Hucky, what’s spunk-water?”\n“Why, it’s water that’s in a stump where a spunk-log was. You find a spunk-log that’s all rotten, and you dig a hole in the ground under it, and you put a tin cup in the hole, and you put the spunk-log over the cup, and you wait till it rains, and the water drips down into the cup, and that’s spunk-water.”\n“Oh, I know. I’ve seen them. But how do you cure warts with it?”\n“You go to the spunk-water stump at midnight, and you put your hand in the water and say, ‘Barley-corn, barley-corn, injun-meal, short-cake, looky here, old True Blue, come to me, come to me.’ And you do that three times, and then you turn around three times and walk away without looking back.”\n“That sounds good, too. But I reckon the dead cat is best. Did you ever try the bean method?”\n“No. What’s that?”\n“You take a bean and split it in two, and you rub one piece on the wart till it bleeds, and then you bury that piece at midnight in a cross-roads, and you burn the other piece. And you say, ‘Bean-bean, come to me, come to me, come to me.’ And you do that three times, and then you turn around three times and walk away without looking back.”\n“That sounds good, too. I reckon I’ll try that sometime. But I reckon the dead cat is best. Did you ever try the potato method?”\n“No. What’s that?”\n“You take a potato and cut it in two, and you rub one piece on the wart till it bleeds, and then you bury that piece at midnight in a cross-roads, and you burn the other piece.

          "text_segment": "“Thomas Sawyer, this is the most astounding confession I have ever listened to. No mere ferule will answer for this offence. Take off your jacket.”\nThe master’s arm performed until it was tired and the stock of switches notably diminished. Then the order followed:\n“Now, sir, go and sit with the girls! And let this be a warning to you.”\nThe titter that rippled around the room appeared to abash the boy, but in reality that result was caused rather more by his worshipful awe of his unknown idol and the dread pleasure that lay in his high good fortune. He sat down upon the end of the pine bench and the girl hitched herself away from him with a toss of her head. Nudges and winks and whispers traversed the room, but Tom sat still, with his arms upon the long, low desk before him, and seemed to study his book.\nBy and by attention ceased from him, and the accustomed school murmur rose upon the dull air once more. Presently the boy began to steal furtive glances at the girl. She observed it, “made a mouth” at him and gave him the back of her head for the space of a minute. When she cautiously faced around again, a peach lay before her. She thrust it away. Tom gently put it back. She thrust it away again, but with less animosity. Tom patiently returned it to its place. Then she let it remain. Tom scrawled on his slate, “Please take it—I got more.” The girl glanced at the words, but made no sign. Now the boy began to draw something on the slate, hiding his work with his left hand. For a time the girl refused to notice; but her human curiosity presently began to manifest itself by hardly perceptible signs. The boy worked on, apparently unconscious. The girl made a sort of non-committal attempt to see, but the boy did not betray that he was aware of it. At last she gave in and hesitatingly whispered:\n“Let me see it.”\nTom partly uncovered a dismal caricature of a house with two gable ends to it and a corkscrew of smoke issuing from the chimney. Then the girl’s interest began to fasten itself upon the work and she forgot everything else. When it was finished, she gazed a moment, then whispered:\n“It’s nice—make a man.”\nThe artist erected a man in the front yard, that resembled a derrick. He could have stepped over the house; but the girl was not hypercritical; she was satisfied with the monster, and whispered:\n“It’s a beautiful man—now make me coming along.”\nTom drew an hour-glass with a full moon and straw limbs to it and armed the spreading fingers with a portentous fan. The girl said:\n“It’s ever so nice—I wish I could draw.”\n“It’s easy,” whispered Tom, “I’ll learn you.”\n“Oh, will you? When?”\n“At noon. Do you go home to dinner?”\n“I’ll stay if you will.”\n“Good—that’s a whack. What’s your name?”\n“Becky Thatcher. What’s yours? Oh, I know. It’s Thomas Sawyer.”\n“That’s the name they lick me by. I’m Tom when I’m good. You call me Tom, will you?”\n“Yes.”\nNow Tom began to scrawl something on the slate, hiding the words from the girl. But she was not backward this time. She begged to see. Tom said:\n“Oh, it ain’t anything.”\n“Yes it is.”\n“No it ain’t. You don’t want to see.”\n“Yes I do, indeed I do. Please let me.”\n“You’ll tell.”\n“No I won’t—deed and deed and double deed won’t.”\n“You won’t tell anybody at all? Ever, as long as you live?”\n“No, I won’t ever tell anybody. Now let me.”\n“Oh, you don’t want to see!”\n“Now that you treat me so, I will see.” And she put her small hand upon his and a little scuffle ensued, Tom pretending to resist in earnest but letting his hand slip by degrees till these words were revealed: “I love you.”\n“Oh, you bad thing!” And she hit his hand a smart rap, but reddened and looked pleased, nevertheless.",

She leaned over and whispered, “Let me see it.” Tom demurred. “Oh, please!” He showed it. It was a house. She said, “That’s nice. Can you draw a man?” He drew one, a grotesque, disproportionate figure. She laughed. “Can you draw me?” He drew a figure with a dress on. “That’s lovely. I wish I could draw.” “I can teach you.” “Oh, can you? When?” “At noon. Do you stay for dinner?” “Yes. If you’ll teach me.” “All right. What’s your name?” “Becky Thatcher. What’s yours? Oh, I know.

In letters a foot high was written, “I LOVE YOU.” Becky blushed, and hid her face in her hands. Tom was in ecstasies. Becky peeped between her fingers. Tom whispered, “Say it.” Becky shook her head. “Say it!” Becky shook her head again. “Say it, or I’ll tell.” Becky took her hands from her face and said, “Oh, you bad thing!” and hit his hand a light blow, but she looked pleased.",

The drowsing murmur of the five and twenty studying scholars soothed the soul like the spell that is in the murmur of bees. Away off in the flaming sunshine, Cardiff Hill lifted its soft green sides through a shimmering veil of heat, tinted with the purple of distance; a few birds floated on lazy wing high in the air; no other living thing was visible but some cows, and they were asleep. Tom’s heart ached to be free, or else to have something of interest to do to pass the dreary time. His hand wandered into his pocket and his face lit up with a glow of gratitude that was prayer, though he did not know it. Then furtively the percussion-cap box came out. He released the tick and put him on the long flat desk.

Joe harassed him awhile, and then he got away and crossed back again. This change of base occurred often. While one boy was worrying the tick with absorbing interest, the other would look on with interest as strong, the two heads bowed together over the slate, and the two souls dead to all things else. At last luck seemed to settle and abide with Joe. The tick tried this, that, and the other course, and got as excited and as anxious as the boys themselves, but time and again just as he would have victory in his very grasp, so to speak, and Tom’s fingers would be twitching to begin, Joe’s pin would deftly head him off, and keep possession. At last Tom could stand it no longer. The temptation was too strong. So he reached out and lent a hand with his pin. Joe was angry in a moment. Said he:\n“Tom, you let him alone.”\n“I only just want to stir him up a little, Joe.”\n“No, sir, it ain’t fair; you just let him alone.”\n“Blame it, I ain’t going to stir him much.”\n“Let him alone, I tell you.”\n“I won’t!”\n“You shall—he’s on my side of the line.”\n“Look here, Joe Harper, whose is that tick?”\n“I don’t care whose tick he is—he’s on my side of the line, and you sha’n’t touch him.”\n“Well, I’ll just bet I will, though.

MAJOR STRUCTURAL ISSUES:\n- The completion does not invent any major events or scenes, and the overall structure follows the original sequence. However, it introduces a slight shift in focus by emphasizing the boys' game, which is not explicitly foregrounded in the original at this point.\n\n2. MISSING ELEMENTS:\n- The completion omits the detail about the specific change in the atmosphere (the hush that had settled over the school) before the master's arrival. This missing environmental cue is important for setting the scene and indicating the master's stealthy approach.\n- The duration or sense of time regarding how long the master observed before acting is less clearly conveyed; the original provides a more nuanced sense of the master's silent observation.\n\n3. INACCURATE ELEMENTS:\n- Early in the passage, the completion introduces the idea that the boys were engrossed in a game, which is a slight shift from the original's focus on their absorption without specifying the activity at this moment.\n- The sequence of the master's actions is slightly altered: the completion suggests he \"finally decided\" to intervene, which adds a sense of deliberation not present in the original.\n- The phrase \"take a hand in the proceedings and furnish a little variety\" is a rewording that changes the tone and intent of the master's intervention, making it sound more playful or intentional than in the original.\n\nOverall, the completion would benefit from more closely following the original's sequence of environmental cues, the boys' obliviousness, and the master's silent observation before his intervention, while avoiding the introduction of new interpretations or shifts in tone."

I couldn't make the roof before; it always looked like stairs.\" \"Oh, it's because you didn't know how. I can do anything I want to. S'pose you learn to draw, now—would you like to?\" \"Yes, I would, if you would stay with me and show me.\" \"Oh, I'll stay with you. Now you try it by yourself.\" She tried it; it was not such a good house, but it was a good enough imitation, and she was radiant. She said: \"Must we keep it a secret?\" \"Oh, I reckon we must. 'Cause we don't want the boys to know all our secrets, do we?\" \"No.\" \"Well,\" said Tom, after a moment's silence, \"do you like rats?\" \"No! I hate them!\" \"Well, I do, too—live ones. But I mean dead ones, to swing around your head by the tail.\" \"No, I don't like them any way,\" said Becky, shuddering. \"What makes you ask?\" \"Oh, nothing. Only I like to hear people talk. Some people like cats, and others like dogs. Well, do you like chewing-gum?\" \"I should say I did! There ain't another girl in school but me that's got chewing-gum.\" \"Say, you furnish it, and I'll furnish the chawing,\" said Tom, gayly. \"No, you've got to furnish the chawing, too. It's the only way.\" \"All right. Give me a chaw, then.\" She gave him a little piece. He chewed it contentedly, and they dangled their legs, and talked. \"Do you ever go to the circus?\" said Tom. \"Yes.\" \"I been to the circus three or four times—lots of times. I'm going to be a clown in a circus when I grow up.\" \"Oh, are you! That will be nice. They're so funny, ain't they?\" \"Yes. And they ain't always clowning, either. Sometimes they do tricks. Oh, say, Becky, was you ever engaged?\" \"What's that?\" \"Why, engaged to be married.\" \"No.\" \"Would you like to be?\" \"I don't know. What is it like?\" \"Like? Why, it ain't like anything. You only just tell a boy you won't ever have anybody but him, ever ever ever, and then he tells you he won't ever have anybody but you, ever ever ever. And then you kiss, and that's all. Anybody can do it.\" \"Why, it's ever so easy! Why, I was engaged to Johnny Miller, one time, for just a little while. It didn't amount to anything, though.\" \"Boy and girl can't be engaged, you know. It's only boys and girls.\" \"Well, I didn't know that. But what do you do when you're engaged?\" \"Why, you just keep company with each other, and you don't keep company with anybody else.\" \"Well, I reckon that's all there is to it.\" \"Yes. And you kiss, and then it's all over. You're engaged. And you can't ever marry anybody else, you know. It's awful.\" \"Why, I didn't know that. Is it so?\" \"Yes. And if you was to die, you know, the one that was left would have to wear black, you know, and not go to parties, nor anything. It's awful.\" \"Oh, dear!\" said Becky, sighing. \"I didn't know that. But what do you do when you're engaged?\" \"Why, you just keep company with each other, and you don't keep company with anybody else.\" \"Well, I reckon that's all there is to it.\" \"Yes. And you kiss, and then it's all over. You're engaged. And you can't ever marry anybody else, you know. It's awful.\" \"Why, I didn't know that. Is it so?\" \"Yes.

                "refinement_prompt": "IMPROVEMENT GUIDANCE:\n1. MAJOR STRUCTURAL ISSUES:\n- The completion invents an extended and detailed drawing lesson and conversation about drawing skills, which is not present in the original passage. This invented section includes a lengthy back-and-forth about drawing techniques, specific objects, and Tom's abilities, which significantly diverges from the original sequence of events.\n- The completion omits the entire dialogue about rats, chewing gum, circuses, and the discussion about being engaged, which are major components of the original passage.\n\n2. MISSING ELEMENTS:\n- The completion does not include the exchange about sharing chewing gum, which is a key interaction in the original.\n- The conversation about circuses, including Tom's aspirations and Becky's responses, is missing.\n- The discussion about engagement, including the explanation and Becky's reaction, is absent.\n- The sense of mutual contentment and the physical actions (such as dangling legs) that illustrate the characters' feelings are not present.\n\n3. INACCURATE ELEMENTS:\n- The completion inaccurately expands the art activity, adding invented dialogue and actions that do not occur in the original, such as the detailed list of things Tom claims he can draw and the step-by-step drawing instructions.\n- The sequence of events is altered: the original moves quickly from the art activity to conversation, while the completion lingers on the drawing lesson and omits the subsequent key interactions.\n- The completion attributes new actions and lines to the characters that are not found in the original, such as Becky resting her chin in her hands and Tom's elaborate boasting about his drawing skills."

Please, Becky—I’ll whisper it, I’ll whisper it ever so easy.”\nBecky hesitating, Tom took silence for consent, and passed his arm about her waist and whispered the tale ever so softly, with his mouth close to her ear. And then he added:\n“Now you whisper it to me—just the same.”\nShe resisted, for a while, and then said:\n“You turn your face away so you can’t see, and then I will. But you mustn’t ever tell anybody—will you, Tom? Now you won’t, will you?”\n“No, indeed, indeed I won’t. Now, Becky.”\nHe turned his face away.

Please, Becky.” And he tugged at her apron and the hands.\nBy and by she gave up, and let her hands drop; her face, all glowing with the struggle, came up and submitted.

He entered a dense wood, picked his pathless way to the centre of it, and sat down on a mossy spot under a spreading oak. There was not even a zephyr stirring; the dead noonday heat had even stilled the songs of the birds; nature lay in a trance that was broken by no sound but the occasional far-off hammering of a wood-pecker, and this seemed to render the pervading silence and sense of loneliness the more profound. The boy’s soul was steeped in melancholy; his feelings were in happy accord with his surroundings. He sat long with his elbows on his knees and his chin in his hands, meditating. It seemed to him that life was but a trouble, at best, and he more than half envied Jimmy Hodges, so lately released; it must be very peaceful, he thought, to lie and slumber and dream forever and ever, with the wind whispering through the trees and caressing the grass and the flowers over the grave, and nothing to bother and grieve about, ever any more. If he only had a clean Sunday-school record he could be willing to go, and be done with it all. Now as to this girl. What had he done? Nothing. He had meant the best in the world, and been treated like a dog—like a very dog. She would be sorry some day—maybe when it was too late. Ah, if he could only die temporarily!",

For frivolity and jokes and spotted tights were an offense, when they intruded themselves upon a spirit that was exalted into the vague august realm of the romantic. No, he would be a soldier, and return after long years, all war-worn and illustrious. No—better still, he would join the Indians, and hunt buffaloes and go on the warpath in the mountain ranges and the trackless great plains of the Far West, and away in the future come back a great chief, bristling with feathers, hideous with paint, and prance into Sunday-school, some drowsy summer morning, with a blood-curdling war-whoop, and sear the eyeballs of all his companions with unappeasable envy. But no, there was something gaudier even than this. He would be a pirate! That was it! now his future lay plain before him, and glowing with unimaginable splendor.

In it lay a marble. Tom’s astonishment was boundless! He scratched his head with a perplexed air, and said:\n“Well, that beats anything!”\nThen he tossed the marble away pettishly, and stood cogitating. The truth was, that a superstition of his had failed, here, which he and all his comrades had always looked upon as infallible. If you buried a marble with certain necessary incantations, and left it alone a fortnight, and then opened the place with the incantation he had just used, you would find that all the marbles you had ever lost had gathered themselves together there, meantime, no matter how widely they had been separated.

He had many a time heard of this thing succeeding but never of its failing before. It did not occur to him that he had tried it several times before, himself, but could never find the hiding-places afterward. He puzzled over the matter some time, and finally decided that some witch had interfered and broken the charm. He thought he would satisfy himself on that point; so he searched around till he found a small sandy spot with a little funnel-shaped depression in it. He laid himself down and put his mouth close to this depression and called—\n“Doodle-bug, doodle-bug, tell me what I want to know! Doodle-bug, doodle-bug, tell me what I want to know!”\nThe sand began to work, and presently a small black bug appeared for a second and then darted under again in a fright.\n“He dasn’t tell!

Who art thou that—that—”\n“Dares to hold such language,” said Tom, prompting—for they talked “by the book,” from memory.\n“Who art thou that dares to hold such language?”\n“I, indeed! I am Robin Hood, as thy caitiff carcase soon shall know.”\n“Then art thou indeed that famous outlaw? Right gladly will I dispute with thee the passes of the merry wood. Have at thee!”\nThey took their lath swords, dumped their other traps on the ground, struck a fencing attitude, foot to foot, and began a grave, careful combat, “two up and two down.” Presently Tom said:\n“Now, if you’ve got the hang, go it lively!”\nSo they “went it lively,” panting and perspiring with the work. By and by Tom shouted:\n“Fall! fall! Why don’t you fall?”\n“I sha’n’t! Why don’t you fall yourself? You’re getting the worst of it.”\n“Why, that ain’t anything. I can’t fall; that ain’t the way it is in the book. The book says, ‘Then with one back-handed stroke he slew poor Guy of Guisborne.’ You’re to turn around and let me hit you in the back.”\nThere was no getting around the authorities, so Joe turned, received the whack and fell.\n“Now,” said Joe, getting up, “you got to let me kill you. That’s fair.”\n“Why, I can’t do that, it ain’t in the book.”\n“Well, it’s blamed mean—that’s all.”\n“Well, say, Joe, you can be Friar Tuck or Much the miller’s son, and lam me with a quarter-staff; or I’ll be the Sheriff of Nottingham and you be Robin Hood a little while and kill me.”\nThis was satisfactory, and so these adventures were carried out. Then Tom became Robin Hood again, and was allowed by the treacherous nun to bleed his strength away through his neglected wound. And at last Joe, representing a whole tribe of weeping outlaws, dragged him sadly forth, gave his bow into his feeble hands, and Tom said, “Where this arrow falls, there bury poor Robin Hood under the greenwood tree.” Then he shot the arrow and fell back and would have died, but he lit on a nettle and sprang up too gaily for a corpse.",

Tom declared himself as Robin Hood, and Joe, playing Guy of Guisborne, readily accepted the challenge to a duel.\n\nThey put down their other playthings, adopted fencing stances, and commenced a serious and deliberate sword fight with their wooden lath swords, following a pattern of 'two up and two down' moves. After some initial sparring, Tom encouraged Joe to fight with more energy.\n\nDuring their duel, Tom insisted that Joe must fall, as dictated by the narrative of their story. Joe initially protested but conceded when Tom referenced the book, which described Guy of Guisborne's demise at Robin Hood's hand, and allowed Tom to strike him in the back.\n\nAfter being 'defeated,' Joe stood up and argued that it was only fair for him to get a chance to 'kill' Tom.

So he lay still, and stared up into the dark. Everything was dismally still. By and by, out of the stillness, little, scarcely perceptible noises began to emphasize themselves. The ticking of the clock began to bring itself into notice. Old beams began to crack mysteriously. The stairs creaked faintly. Evidently spirits were abroad. A measured, muffled snore issued from Aunt Polly’s chamber. And now the tiresome chirping of a cricket that no human ingenuity could locate, began. Next the ghastly ticking of a death-watch in the wall at the bed’s head made Tom shudder—it meant that somebody’s days were numbered. Then the howl of a far-off dog rose on the night air, and was answered by a fainter howl from a remoter distance. Tom was in an agony. At last he was satisfied that time had ceased and eternity begun; he began to doze, in spite of himself; the clock chimed eleven, but he did not hear it. And then there came, mingling with his half-formed dreams, a most melancholy caterwauling. The raising of a neighboring window disturbed him. A cry of “Scat! you devil!” and the crash of an empty bottle against the back of his aunt’s woodshed brought him wide awake, and a single minute later he was dressed and out of the window and creeping along the roof of the “ell” on all fours. He “meow’d” with caution once or twice, as he went; then jumped to the roof of the woodshed and thence to the ground. Huckleberry Finn was there, with his dead cat. The boys moved off and disappeared in the gloom. At the end of half an hour they were wading through the tall grass of the graveyard.",

He gave a low, answering meow. The sound came again, quite close now. He heard a soft thud on the woodshed roof. He meowed again, a little louder. A moment later, a dark shape appeared at the window.

He must force some talk. So he said in a whisper:\n“Hucky, do you believe the dead people like it for us to be here?”\nHuckleberry whispered:\n“I wisht I knowed. It’s awful solemn like, ain’t it?”\n“I bet it is.”\nThere was a considerable pause, while the boys canvassed this matter inwardly. Then Tom whispered:\n“Say, Hucky—do you reckon Hoss Williams hears us talking?”\n“O’ course he does. Least his sperrit does.”\nTom, after a pause:\n“I wish I’d said Mister Williams. But I never meant any harm. Everybody calls him Hoss.”\n“A body can’t be too partic’lar how they talk ’bout these-yer dead people, Tom.”\nThis was a damper, and conversation died again.\nPresently Tom seized his comrade’s arm and said:\n“Sh!”\n“What is it, Tom?” And the two clung together with beating hearts.\n“Sh! There ’tis again! Didn’t you hear it?”\n“I—”\n“There! Now you hear it.”\n“Lord, Tom, they’re coming! They’re coming, sure. What’ll we do?”\n“I dono. Think they’ll see us?”\n“Oh, Tom, they can see in the dark, same as cats. I wisht I hadn’t come.”\n“Oh, don’t be afeard. I don’t believe they’ll bother us. We ain’t doing any harm. If we keep perfectly still, maybe they won’t notice us at all.”\n“I’ll try to, Tom, but, Lord, I’m all of a shiver.”\n“Listen!”\nThe boys bent their heads together and scarcely breathed. A muffled sound of voices floated up from the far end of the graveyard.\n“Look! See there!” whispered Tom. “What is it?”\n“It’s devil-fire. Oh, Tom, this is awful.”\nSome vague figures approached through the gloom, swinging an old-fashioned tin lantern that freckled the ground with innumerable little spangles of light. Presently Huckleberry whispered with a shudder:\n“It’s the devils sure enough. Three of ’em! Lordy, Tom, we’re goners! Can you pray?”\n“I’ll try, but don’t you be afeard. They ain’t going to hurt us. ‘Now I lay me down to sleep, I—’”\n“Sh!”\n“What is it, Huck?”\n“They’re humans! One of ’em is, anyway. One of ’em’s old Muff Potter’s voice.”\n“No—’tain’t so, is it?”\n“I bet I know it. Don’t you stir nor budge. He ain’t sharp enough to notice us. Drunk, the same as usual, likely—blamed old rip!”\n“All right, I’ll keep still. Now they’re stuck. Can’t find it. Here they come again. Now they’re hot. Cold again. Hot again. Red hot! They’re p’inted right, this time. Say, Huck, I know another o’ them voices; it’s Injun Joe.”\n“That’s so—that murderin’ half-breed! I’d druther they was devils a dern sight. What kin they be up to?”\nThe whisper died wholly out, now, for the three men had reached the grave and stood within a few feet of the boys’ hiding-place.\n“Here it is,” said the third voice; and the owner of it held the lantern up and revealed the face of young Doctor Robinson.",

If he had been alone he would not have liked it—but it meant that the augury of the dead cat had come true, and he was now officially connected with the awful mysteries and superstitions of the graveyard. Huckleberry Finn was just what he needed in this solemn hour. Huck was notorious among the boys as an exceedingly formidable power in all matters of ancient tradition and superstition. Tom was deeply impressed with what he knew, and so was all the rest of the boys. He knew all the signs and spells and incantations that ever were known among the negroes and all the other ignorant folk in the village, and he never forgot them, and he always practiced them. This was better than book-learning, and more profitable. Tom looked at Huck with awe, and wished he could come under that mighty protection somehow. He would give anything to know as much as Huck did. It seemed about a year since the owl hooted, but it was only a minute. Presently Tom whispered:\n“Hucky, do you believe the dead people like it for us to be here?”\nHuck shuddered in the dark. “I unno.

What does it mean?”\n“Them that comes here to dig for buried treasure hides a candle in a tin lantern, and whilst he’s diggin’, he lifts it up every now and then to keep off sperrits.”\n“That’s it! I see it! It ain’t a sperrit at all. It’s a man with a lantern.”\n“Yes,” said Huck, “and there’s two more coming behind him.”\n“Lord, Hucky, it’s the devils sure enough,” said Tom, “this time. This is awful. We can’t stand it. Let’s run.”\n“No,” said Huck, “we can’t. They’d see us sure. We got to keep still, Tom. I wish I was dead.”\nThe light bore steadily down upon them, and they saw the figures of three men stepping cautiously along in its rays.

MISSING ELEMENTS:\n- The completion lacks the original's detailed sequence of whispered exchanges about whether the dead can hear them, the importance of how they refer to the deceased, and the resulting silence.\n- The moment when Tom and Huck hear noises and react with fear, including their physical responses and whispered reassurances, is only partially present and lacks the original's progression and tension.\n- The approach of the three figures, the description of the lantern, and the boys' identification of the voices and realization of who the men are is missing.\n- The final revelation of Doctor Robinson's face is not included.\n\n3. INACCURATE ELEMENTS:\n- The completion provides inaccurate time references and invented details about the time of night, which are not present in the original.\n- The order of events is disrupted, with invented dialogue and actions occurring before the actual events of the original passage.\n- Some actions and lines are misattributed or assigned to the wrong character, and invented motivations or explanations are given that do not match the original.\n- The completion introduces new fears and explanations (such as being fetched by ghosts or the use of drugs) that are not part of the original narrative.\n\nTo improve, focus on accurately following the sequence of events, avoid inventing new scenes or dialogue, and ensure all key moments and character interactions from the original are included in the correct order."

The barrow was got ready and the corpse placed on it, covered with a blanket, and bound to its place with the rope.

MISSING ELEMENTS:\n- The completion omits the boys' repeated glances backward and their apprehension about being followed, as well as the specific mention of every stump appearing as a threat.\n- The detail about the barking of watch-dogs and how it affects the boys' speed is missing.\n- The original's depiction of the boys' exhaustion and relief upon reaching the tannery, including their physical collapse, is not fully captured.\n- The gradual slowing of their pulses and the transition into whispered conversation is not clearly presented.\n- The original's dialogue about who might tell and the specific fear of Injun Joe is not fully preserved in sequence or content.\n\n3. INACCURATE ELEMENTS:\n- The completion inaccurately describes the boys as not daring to look back, whereas the original specifies their backward glances.\n- The sequence of events is altered: the completion has the boys running through the village and down to the river, which does not match the original's progression.\n- The completion attributes invented dialogue and changes the flow of the conversation, including the way the boys discuss the consequences and their fears.\n- The completion misattributes lines and changes the nature of the boys' agreement and realization about the danger posed by Injun Joe.\n- The ending of the conversation is altered, with invented lines and a different resolution than in the original."

They didn't dare look back, the image of the bloody knife and the fallen body seared into their minds. Every rustle of leaves, every snap of a twig, sent fresh waves of panic through them. They stumbled over roots and rocks, their breath coming in ragged gasps, driven by a primal fear that Injun Joe might be pursuing them. The cool night air did little to soothe the burning terror that consumed them. They ran until their legs ached and their lungs screamed for air, putting as much distance as possible between themselves and the ghastly scene in the graveyard.\n\nFinally, exhausted and trembling, they collapsed in the thick woods far from the village lights. They lay there for a long time, catching their breath, the silence of the woods amplifying their fear. The moon peeked through the trees, casting eerie shadows that seemed to dance with the specter of murder. Tom, his voice a hoarse whisper, finally broke the silence. \"Huck, we gotta swear. Swear we won't ever tell a soul.\" Huck, equally terrified, readily agreed. They made a solemn pact, a blood oath sworn in the dead of night, binding them to secrecy. The weight of their terrible knowledge settled upon them, a burden they would carry alone. They knew their lives had changed forever. Getting back to the village felt like returning to a world they no longer belonged to, haunted by the secret they shared."

Tom held the shingle and guided the pencil; Huckleberry held the candle or lamp. The oath read: “Huck Finn and Tom Sawyer swears they will keep mum about This and They wish They may Drop down dead in Their Tracks if They ever Tell and Rot.” Tom thought he ought to make an impressive finish, so he added: “& Rot.” Huckleberry was full of admiration for Tom’s learning and the awful solemnity of the language. He said he wouldn’t ever tell, he’d be chopped to pieces first—said so strong he shuddered. Tom felt a little shiver to go with it. “Now,” said Tom, “we’ll sign it. How’ll we do it? We’ll prick our fingers and sign it with blood.” That suited Huckleberry. Tom said: “You got your pin?” “No,” said Huckleberry. Tom said: “Well, I got my needle. I’ll prick my finger.” He did so. “Now,” said he, “hold your finger over it and let a drop fall on the shingle, and I’ll spread it around with my finger.” “No,” said Huckleberry, “I’ll prick my finger and let a drop fall on the shingle, and you spread it around with your finger.” So he did. Tom spread it around with his finger and signed his name.

Tom spread it around with his finger and signed Huckleberry’s name. Then he said: “Now, we’ll bury it.” They buried it near the wall, with such dismal ceremonies and incantations as they could invent. They then crept away, and Tom felt as if he were walking on air.

                "text": "Tom’s whole being applauded this idea. It was deep, and dark, and awful; the right kind of a thing for blood-curdling occasions. He got the pine shingle they had evidently used for a writing-board, some red keel which they had found somewhere and treasured in their pockets, and the two boys sat down by the light of the moon and carefully scrawled the oath. Tom held the shingle and guided the pencil; Huckleberry held the candle or lamp. The oath read: “Huck Finn and Tom Sawyer swears they will keep mum about This and They wish They may Drop down dead in Their Tracks if They ever Tell and Rot.” Tom thought he ought to make an impressive finish, so he added: “& Rot.” Huckleberry was full of admiration for Tom’s learning and the awful solemnity of the language. He said he wouldn’t ever tell, he’d be chopped to pieces first—said so strong he shuddered. Tom felt a little shiver to go with it. “Now,” said Tom, “we’ll sign it. How’ll we do it? We’ll prick our fingers and sign it with blood.” That suited Huckleberry. Tom said: “You got your pin?” “No,” said Huckleberry. Tom said: “Well, I got my needle. I’ll prick my finger.” He did so. “Now,” said he, “hold your finger over it and let a drop fall on the shingle, and I’ll spread it around with my finger.” “No,” said Huckleberry, “I’ll prick my finger and let a drop fall on the shingle, and you spread it around with your finger.” So he did. Tom spread it around with his finger and signed his name. Then he said: “Now, Huck, you sign yours.” “I can’t write,” said Huckleberry. “Well, I’ll write it for you,” said Tom. “You hold your finger over it and let a drop fall on the shingle, and I’ll spread it around with my finger.” So he did. Tom spread it around with his finger and signed Huckleberry’s name. Then he said: “Now, we’ll bury it.” They buried it near the wall, with such dismal ceremonies and incantations as they could invent. They then crept away, and Tom felt as if he were walking on air.

What’s that?” he whispered.\n“Sounds like—like hogs grunting. No—it’s somebody snoring, Tom.”\n“That is it! Where ’bouts is it, Huck?”\n“I bleeve it’s down at ’tother end. Sounds so, anyway. Pap used to sleep there, sometimes, ’long with the hogs, but laws bless you, he just lifts things when he snores. Besides, I reckon he ain’t ever coming back to this town any more.”\nThe spirit of adventure rose in the boys’ souls once more.\n“Hucky, do you das’t to go if I lead?”\n“I don’t like to, much. Tom, s’pose it’s Injun Joe!”\nTom quailed. But presently the temptation rose up strong again and the boys agreed to try, with the understanding that they would take to their heels if the snoring stopped. So they went tiptoeing stealthily down, the one behind the other. When they had got to within five steps of the snorer, Tom stepped on a stick, and it broke with a sharp snap. The man moaned, writhed a little, and his face came into the moonlight. It was Muff Potter. The boys’ hearts had stood still, and their hopes too, when the man moved, but their fears passed away now. They tip-toed out, through the broken weather-boarding, and stopped at a little distance to exchange a parting word.",

They waited a little while longer, listening, and still no sound interrupted the dead stillness. Tom said:\n“Hucky, what do you s’pose it was?”\nHuck said:\n“I dono. But maybe it was a dog fight that got started, and he waked up and come to see, and when he got here they’d got through and gone. A dog fight is dreadful bad.”\nTom was satisfied. They waited a little longer, then they got up cautiously and moved off down the alley in the dark, hugging the fence. In a little while they were far enough away to venture to speak in whispers and walk erect. They continued pretty far, then stopped and leaned on the fence, listening. All the distant sounds they could catch were familiar and homely—voices of men talking, the occasional bark of a dog, the drowsy drone of insects, the far-off notes of night birds. Nothing threatening, nothing dismal; everything was peace and comfort and security. They sighed a vast sigh of relief. Tom felt light and airy and grand, and was so glad to be alive that he could hardly contain himself. He said:\n“Hucky, I guess we’d better turn in now. I’m feeling pretty jolly.

They waited till it came abreast of them and passed along; then they groped their way into the slaughter-house, thinking to rest themselves a moment and get their breath before starting for home. They found a nice place among the dry hides and stretched themselves out; and two minutes later they were snoring comfortably. They were sound asleep in a few minutes, and remained so till long after midnight. Then Tom stirred, and muttered:\n“Hucky, it’s getting late. We better—”\nHe got no further, for a sudden, sharp cry came from the slaughter-house. Both boys were instantly wide awake and on their feet. They stood listening, with their hearts in their mouths. A moment later they heard a groan, then a stifled moan, then a groan again. Silence. Then another groan, and a voice spoke:\n“Oh, Lord, have mercy on my soul!”\nThen a long, shuddering sigh. The boys were petrified. They waited, listening, for what seemed an age. Then they heard a movement, and a voice spoke—a voice they knew:\n“Muff Potter!”\n“Yes, it’s him.

                "refinement_prompt": "IMPROVEMENT GUIDANCE:\n1. MAJOR STRUCTURAL ISSUES:\n- The completion invents several extended dialogues and exchanges between the characters that are not present in the original passage, especially lengthy discussions about stray dogs, ringworm, and repeated debates about the meaning of the dog's howling.\n- The completion omits a significant conversation about events at Johnny Miller’s house, the whippoorwill, and Gracie Miller’s accident, which are important to the original passage.\n- The ending sequence, where the boys separate and reflect, is missing and replaced with invented dialogue and actions.\n\n2. MISSING ELEMENTS:\n- Early in the passage, the completion does not include the boys’ simultaneous exclamation upon recognizing the dog, which is a key moment.\n- The middle section lacks the recounting of specific superstitions and events involving other characters and locations, which are discussed in the original.\n- The final part is missing the boys’ discussion about the fate of Gracie Miller and the reference to local beliefs, as well as their parting and internal contemplation.\n\n3. INACCURATE ELEMENTS:\n- The completion inaccurately describes Potter as sleeping, which is not indicated in the original.\n- The sequence of events is altered, with invented actions (such as the boys walking away and stopping to talk again) that do not match the original order.\n- The dialogue attributes certain beliefs and statements to the wrong characters and introduces new reasoning not present in the source material.\n- The completion repeats certain exchanges multiple times, which does not reflect the structure or flow of the original passage."

The air was thick with the scent of damp earth and decaying leaves, and every rustle of the wind sounded like a whisper from the graves. This wasn't just any dog's howl; it was the mournful cry of a stray, a sound that country folk said meant death was coming for someone. Tom's heart hammered against his ribs like a trapped bird.

He reached his bed in safety, though his hands would not quit trembling. He lay long thinking and congratulating himself upon his sagacity in escaping, and then fell into a deep sleep. He never knew that Sid was awake and ranging his consciousness and his memory with tranquil satisfaction. Sid knew all about it. Sid was not disturbed by any trouble of conscience, the peril of digging in the graveyard was not Sid's peril; it was Tom's. Sid was sound asleep at last, and Tom was sound asleep, too. When Tom awoke the sun was shining upon the bed, and his clothes lay on the chair, but Sid was gone. He wondered at this. He got up and dressed, feeling sore and stiff and drowsy. The room was very still. He went downstairs and found the family at the breakfast table, but they had finished. They were not talking, and they did not look at him. He sat down and began to eat, but he felt uncomfortable. Aunt Polly was looking grave and thoughtful. Sid was looking demure and innocent. Mary was looking sorry for him. Nobody said a word.

He undressed with exceeding caution, and fell asleep almost before he could cover himself with the sheet. He had had a wild night, and was utterly worn out. When he awoke, the sun was shining brightly through the window, and his heart sank within him. He remembered everything – the graveyard, the murder, the blood oath, the terror. He lay still, listening to Sid's regular breathing, and felt a cold dread creep over him. He knew he had to face Aunt Polly, and the thought was almost unbearable. The events of the previous night seemed like a terrible dream, yet the reality of it pressed down on him, heavy and suffocating. He wondered if Huck was awake, feeling the same crushing weight of their secret. The world outside seemed oblivious, going about its cheerful morning business, while he carried this awful burden. He wished he could go back in time, back to the innocent hours before the moon rose over the graveyard. But there was no going back. The secret was theirs, and it bound them together in fear and silence. He finally stirred, knowing he couldn't hide forever."

It's bleeding! Oh, see, everybody! it's bleeding!\" It was true; the wound was bleeding again. There was a murmur of solemn awe, and a stillness so profound that one could hear a pin drop. Then came the scare again. As the body was raised in the sheet the dammed blood gushed from the wound upon the ground. Everybody present, doctor and all, noted it, and almost every face blanched. Tom and Huck were filled with hope. This thing was awful, but it was a sign they had heard of; they wished they had not forgotten the circumstances connected with it. Pretty soon it all came back to them. Muff Potter's arm was near a foot of the dead man's, that was it. People whispered it to each other; and many of them shook their heads, and others looked sorrowful, and others were silent, because they did not know what to think. Some of them spoke out, and said it was awful, and a sure sign; and they added that it used to be said that the murderer's hand would bleed, when laid upon the wound. Tom and Huck were disappointed. There was nothing in the circumstance that could help their secret out. They wished they had not noticed it, or thought about it. Then they remembered what they had been saying to themselves about speaking out, and they were glad they had not done it. They saw now that if they had spoken, it would have done no good, and might have done harm.",

MAJOR STRUCTURAL ISSUES:\n- The completion introduces several invented scenes and dialogue not present in the original, such as detailed descriptions of Injun Joe's demeanor (smoking a pipe, rolling up sleeves), invented dialogue from a man with a rubber band on his hat, and repeated crowd reactions that are not in the source passage.\n- The completion adds extended internal reflections and emotional responses from Tom and Huck that go beyond what is present in the original, including their supposed agony and despair, and their sense of being doomed to keep a secret forever.\n\n2. MISSING ELEMENTS:\n- The completion omits the boys' specific resolution to watch Injun Joe at night in hopes of seeing his \"dread master,\" which is a key element in the original passage.\n- The completion does not include the specific observation that the boys could not take their eyes off Injun Joe, which is a significant detail in the original.\n- The completion lacks the villagers' specific remark about the proximity of Muff Potter to the crime, which is important for the narrative progression.\n\n3. INACCURATE ELEMENTS:\n- The completion inaccurately describes the sequence of events, such as the process of raising the body and the crowd's reaction, by adding invented dialogue and actions.\n- The completion misattributes actions and emotional states, such as Injun Joe's supposed calmness being repeatedly emphasized with invented physical actions, and Muff Potter's trembling being described in detail not present in the original.\n- The completion repeats the \"it's bleeding\" whisper multiple times and attributes it to various unnamed villagers, which is not consistent with the original's handling of the crowd's reaction.\n- The completion incorrectly presents the boys' hope and despair as a prolonged internal struggle, rather than the more concise disappointment described in the original.\n\nTo improve, focus on accurately representing the sequence and content of events, avoid inventing new scenes or dialogue, and ensure that key narrative elements and character resolutions from the original are included."

There is no telling what might have happened, now, but luckily the concern passed out of Aunt Polly’s face and she came to Tom’s relief without knowing it. She said:\n“Sho! It’s that dreadful murder. I dream about it most every night myself. Sometimes I dream it’s me that done it.”\nMary said she had been affected much the same way. Sid seemed satisfied. Tom got out of the presence as quick as he plausibly could, and after that he complained of toothache for a week, and tied up his jaws every night. He never knew that Sid lay nightly watching, and frequently slipped the bandage free and then leaned on his elbow listening a good while at a time, and afterward slipped the bandage back to its place again. Tom’s distress of mind wore off gradually and the toothache grew irksome and was discarded. If Sid really managed to make anything out of Tom’s disjointed mutterings, he kept it to himself.",

He began to find himself hanging around her father’s house, nights, and feeling very miserable. She was ill. What if she should die! There was distraction in the thought. He no longer took an interest in war, nor even in piracy. The charm of life was gone; there was nothing but dreariness left. He put his hoop away, and his bat; there was no joy in them any more. His aunt was concerned. She began to try all manner of remedies on him. She was one of those people who are infatuated with patent medicines and all new-fangled methods of producing health or mending it. She was an inveterate experimenter in these things. When something fresh in this line came out she was in a fever, right away, to try it; not on herself, for she was never ailing, but on anybody else that came handy. She was a subscriber for all the “Health” periodicals and phrenological frauds; and the solemn ignorance they were inflated with was breath to her nostrils. All the “rot” they contained about ventilation, and how to go to bed, and how to get up, and what to eat, and what to drink, and how much exercise to take, and what frame of mind to keep one’s self in, and what sort of clothing to wear, was all gospel to her, and she never observed that her health-journals of the current month customarily upset everything they had recommended the month before. She was as simple-hearted and honest as the day was long, and so she was an easy victim. She gathered together her quack periodicals and her quack medicines, and thus armed with death, went about on her pale horse, metaphorically speaking, with “hell following after.” But she never suspected that she was not an angel of healing and the balm of Gilead in disguise, to the suffering neighbors.",

She dropped the water treatment and everything else, and pinned her faith to Pain-killer. She gave Tom a teaspoonful and watched with the deepest anxiety for the result. Her troubles were instantly at rest, her soul at peace again; for the “indifference” was broken up. The boy could not have shown a wilder, heartier interest, if she had built a fire under him.\nTom felt that it was time to wake up; this sort of life might be romantic enough, in his blighted condition, but it was getting to have too little sentiment and too much distracting variety about it. So he thought over various plans for relief, and finally hit upon that of professing to be fond of Pain-killer. He asked for it so often that he became a nuisance, and his aunt ended by telling him to help himself and quit bothering her. If it had been Sid, she would have had no misgivings to alloy her delight; but since it was Tom, she watched the bottle clandestinely.

The scoldings of Aunt Polly, the jeers of his schoolmates, even the occasional cuff from the schoolmaster, seemed to bounce off him like pebbles from a rock. His mind was too full of other things – grander, more absorbing matters. The memory of Becky Thatcher, sometimes sweet and sometimes agonizingly distant, occupied a vast territory in his thoughts. He would trace her name in the dust with his toe, sighing dramatically, or conjure elaborate scenarios of heroism where he would rescue her from peril and win her eternal admiration.\n\nBut beyond the pangs of first love, there was the lure of adventure. The woods held secrets, the river whispered tales of pirates and hidden treasures, and every abandoned house or dark cave promised mystery. He and Huck Finn, kindred spirits in their disdain for conventional society and their thirst for excitement, were constantly plotting. Their latest scheme involved exploring McDougal's Cave, a place shrouded in local legend and fear. The thought of venturing into its depths, armed with candles and a ball of string, filled Tom with a thrilling mixture of dread and anticipation that dwarfed any concern about trivial punishments.\n\nSchool was a necessary evil, a cage to be endured until freedom arrived. Lessons were a blur, recitations a chore to be mumbled through. His focus was entirely external – on the weather, on the flight of a bird, on the distant sound of a steamboat whistle, anything that hinted at the world outside the stuffy classroom walls. The teacher's ruler might sting, but the sting was fleeting, a minor annoyance compared to the vast, exciting landscape of his imagination and the promise of real-world escapades waiting just beyond the schoolhouse door. He was a general planning campaigns, a pirate captain charting courses, a knight errant dreaming of quests – and such lofty pursuits left little room for worrying about mere earthly troubles like being kept after school or having his ears boxed. His spirit was already far away"

It done him good, too. I never see him get around so since—”\n“Oh, go ’long with you, Tom, before you aggravate me again. And you try and see if you can’t be a good boy, for once, and you needn’t take any more medicine.”",

And now, as usual of late, he hung about the gate of the schoolyard instead of playing with his comrades. He was sick, he said, and he looked it. He tried to seem to be looking everywhere but whither he really was looking—down the road. Presently Jeff Thatcher hove in sight, and Tom’s face lighted; he gazed a moment, and then turned sorrowfully away. When Jeff arrived, Tom accosted him; and “led up” warily to opportunities for remark about Becky, but the giddy lad never could see the bait. Tom watched and watched, hoping whenever a frisking frock came in sight, and hating the owner of it as soon as he saw she was not the right one. At last frocks ceased to appear, and he dropped hopelessly into the dumps; he entered the empty schoolhouse and sat down to suffer. Then one more frock passed in at the gate, and Tom’s heart gave a great bound. The next instant he was out, and “going on” like an Indian; yelling, laughing, chasing boys, jumping over the fence at risk of life and limb, throwing handsprings, standing on his head—doing all the heroic things he could conceive of, and keeping a furtive eye out, all the while, to see if Becky Thatcher was noticing. But she seemed to be unconscious of it all; she never looked. Could it be possible that she was not aware that he was there? He carried his exploits to her immediate vicinity; came war-whooping around, snatched a boy’s cap, hurled it to the roof of the schoolhouse, broke through a group of boys, tumbling them in every direction, and fell sprawling, himself, under Becky’s nose, almost upsetting her—and she turned, with her nose in the air, and he heard her say: “Mf! some people think they’re mighty smart—always showing off!”\nTom’s cheeks burned. He gathered himself up and sneaked off, crushed and crestfallen.",

It’s a good place for a pirate’s rendezvous.” “That’s the very place, Joe. We’ll go there to-night. We’ll take a raft and float down.” “All right, Tom.

Presently, Tom sighed a sigh that seemed to come from the bottom of his boots. Joe responded with one equally profound. 'Joe,' said Tom, at length, his voice husky with emotion, 'let's you and me run away.' Joe's eyes lit up with a sudden, fierce joy that quickly subsided into his former gloom. 'Yes, Tom, let's.

Who were to be the subjects of their piracies was a matter that did not occur to them. Then they hunted up Huckleberry Finn, and he joined them promptly, for all careers were one to him; he was indifferent. They presently separated to meet at a lonely spot on the river-bank two miles above the village at the favorite hour—which was midnight. There was a small log raft there which they meant to capture. Each would bring hooks and lines, and such provision as he could steal in the most dark and mysterious way—as became outlaws. And before the afternoon was done, they had all managed to enjoy the sweet glory of spreading the fact that pretty soon the town would “hear something.” All who got this vague hint were cautioned to “be mum and wait.”",

MISSING ELEMENTS:\n- The completion does not include the original's emphasis on the quietness and the moment of listening before Tom whistles.\n- The original's sequence of whistle signals and their responses is condensed and partially omitted; the completion only describes a single whistle and response, rather than the full exchange.\n- The guarded voice's challenge and the countersign exchange are altered, with some steps missing or merged.\n- The original's detail about Tom tumbling the ham over the bluff before descending is missing; instead, the completion describes Tom throwing his hat overboard, which is not in the original.\n- The commentary about the easier path along the shore and its lack of appeal to pirates is omitted.\n\n3. INACCURATE ELEMENTS:\n- The completion introduces inaccurate time details by describing Tom waiting for a long time and hearing a skiff approach, which does not occur in the original.\n- The sequence of events is altered: in the original, Tom whistles after a brief moment of listening, but in the completion, he waits for a skiff before whistling.\n- The challenge and countersign exchange is slightly inaccurate, with the wording and order differing from the original.\n- The action of Tom throwing his hat overboard is inaccurate; the original describes him tumbling the ham over the bluff.\n- The description of Tom's descent is altered, with invented internal reflections and a different sense of difficulty than in the original.\n- The completion omits the original's final commentary about the pirates' preference for difficulty and danger over comfort."

The river was not high, so there was not more than a two or three mile current. Hardly a word was said during the next three-quarters of an hour. Now the raft was passing before the distant town. Two or three glimmering lights showed where it lay, peacefully sleeping, beyond the vague vast sweep of star-gemmed water, unconscious of the tremendous event that was happening. The Black Avenger stood still with folded arms, “looking his last” upon the scene of his former joys and his later sufferings, and wishing “she” could see him now, abroad on the wild sea, facing peril and death with dauntless heart, going to his doom with a grim smile on his lips. It was but a small strain on his imagination to remove Jackson’s Island beyond eye-shot of the village, and so he “looked his last” with a broken and satisfied heart. The other pirates were looking their last, too; and they all looked so long that they came near letting the current drift them out of the range of the island. But they discovered the danger in time, and made shift to avert it. About two o’clock in the morning the raft grounded on the bar two hundred yards above the head of the island, and they waded back and forth until they had landed their freight. Part of the little raft’s belongings consisted of an old sail, and this they spread over a nook in the bushes for a tent to shelter their provisions; but they themselves would sleep in the open air in good weather, as became outlaws.",

He had finished gouging out a cob, and now he fitted a weed stem to it, loaded it with tobacco, and was pressing a coal to the charge and blowing a cloud of fragrant smoke—he was in the full bloom of luxurious contentment. The other pirates envied him this majestic vice, and secretly resolved to acquire it shortly. Presently Huck said:\n“What does pirates have to do?”\nTom said:\n“Oh, they have just a bully time—take ships and burn them, and get the money and bury it in awful places in their island where there’s ghosts and things to watch it, and kill everybody in the ships—make ’em walk a plank.”\n“And they carry the women to the island,” said Joe; “they don’t kill the women.”\n“No,” assented Tom, “they don’t kill the women—they’re too noble. And the women’s always beautiful, too.”\n“And don’t they wear the bulliest clothes! Oh no! All gold and silver and di’monds,” said Joe, with enthusiasm.\n“Who?” said Huck.\n“Why, the pirates.”\nHuck scanned his own clothing forlornly.\n“I reckon I ain’t dressed fitten for a pirate,” said he, with a regretful pathos in his voice; “but I ain’t got none but these.”\nBut the other boys told him the fine clothes would come fast enough, after they should have begun their adventures. They made him understand that his poor rags would do to begin with, though it was customary for wealthy pirates to start with a proper wardrobe.\nGradually their talk died out and drowsiness began to steal upon the eyelids of the little waifs. The pipe dropped from the fingers of the Red-Handed, and he slept the sleep of the conscience-free and the weary. The Terror of the Seas and the Black Avenger of the Spanish Main had more difficulty in getting to sleep. They said their prayers inwardly, and lying down, since there was nobody there with authority to make them kneel and recite aloud; in truth, they had a mind not to say them at all, but they were afraid to proceed to such lengths as that, lest they might call down a sudden and special thunderbolt from heaven. Then at once they reached and hovered upon the imminent verge of sleep—but an intruder came, now, that would not “down.” It was conscience. They began to feel a vague fear that they had been doing wrong to run away; and next they thought of the stolen meat, and then the real torture came. They tried to argue it away by reminding conscience that they had purloined sweetmeats and apples scores of times; but conscience was not to be appeased by such thin plausibilities; it seemed to them, in the end, that there was no getting around the stubborn fact that taking sweetmeats was only “hooking,” while taking bacon and hams and such valuables was plain simple stealing—and there was a command against that in the Bible. So they inwardly resolved that so long as they remained in the business, their piracies should not again be sullied with the crime of stealing. Then conscience granted a truce, and these curiously inconsistent pirates fell peacefully to sleep.",

The other boys watched him, fascinated, and wondered if they could ever achieve such dignity and such calm grandeur of spirit. Then Tom said:\n\n“What do pirates have to do?”\n\nTom thought a moment, and then said:\n\n“Oh, they have just a bully time—take ships, and burn them, and get the money and bury it in awful places in their island where there’s ghosts and things, and kill everybody in the ships—make ’em walk a plank.”\n\n“And they carry the women to the island,” added Joe Harper, eagerly. “They don’t kill the women. They’re too noble. And the women are always beautiful, too.”\n\n“And they wear splendid clothes, all silk and velvet and feathers and just shine with diamonds and things,” said Joe.\n\n“Not when they’re beginning,” said Tom Sawyer. “But they ARE brave, and they have adventures, and they get plenty of money and stuff, and divide it up. They pull a flag out that’s death and destruction, and everybody’s afraid of them. A pirate’s life is always jolly; they’re always singing songs, and drinking, and carrying on. I wish I was a pirate.”\n\n“Me, too,” said Joe.\n\n“I wish I was a pirate,” said Huck Finn. “It’s better’n being a robber. A robber only—”\n\n“Don’t you reckon pirates have to whack other pirates with their swords, first?” said Joe.\n\n“No,” said Tom, “they don’t fight each other; they all go for the other ships, and they all divide up fair.”\n\n“Come, now, Huck, you ain’t agoing to be pirates, are you?”\n\n“Yes,” said Huck, “I’m going to be a pirate. I’m going to get under a black flag, and I’m going to kill everybody that ain’t a pirate.”\n\n“Well,” said Tom, “you’re all right, then. You’ll do. Come, now, let’s get to sleep. We’ll be pirates in the morning. Joe, you’re a pirate. Huck, you’re a pirate. I’m a pirate. We’re all pirates.”\n\nAs the conversation died away, drowsiness began to steal upon the eyelids of the youthful criminals. As fast as Tom and Joe would talk a while, they would stop and think a while; then they would talk a while again. By and by, Joe said:\n\n“I wish I hadn’t run away, Tom. I wish I hadn’t.”\n\n“Why, Joe, you ain’t afraid, are you?”\n\n“No, I ain’t afraid.”\n\n“Well, then, what’s the matter?”\n\n“Nothing.

MISSING ELEMENTS:\n- The completion does not include the sense of calm and peace that is emphasized in the original, nor does it mention the overall silence and stillness as a form of nature's meditation.\n- The transition from Tom's confusion to his understanding of his surroundings is not fully developed; the step where Tom comprehends his situation is missing.\n\n3. INACCURATE ELEMENTS:\n- The completion adds invented details about the \"faint murmur of the distant river\" and the \"fragrant smell of leaves and damp earth,\" which are not part of the original passage.\n- The description of the fire and the dewdrops is generally accurate, but the sequence of Tom's actions and realizations is slightly altered, with some steps omitted or rearranged.\n- The completion describes Joe and Huck as \"still sound asleep,\" which is a minor variation, but the main issue is the addition of invented environmental sounds and smells that shift the focus from the original's emphasis on silence and calm."

Gradually the cool dim gray of the morning whitened, and as gradually sounds multiplied and life manifested itself. The marvel of Nature shaking off sleep and going to work unfolded itself to the musing boy. A little green worm came crawling over a dewy leaf, lifting two-thirds of his body into the air from time to time and “sniffing around,” then proceeding again—for he was measuring, Tom said; and when the worm approached him, of its own accord, he sat as still as a stone, with his hopes rising and falling, by turns, as the creature still came toward him or seemed inclined to go elsewhere; and when at last it considered a painful moment with its curved body in the air and then came decisively down upon Tom’s leg and began a journey over him, his whole heart was glad—for that meant that he was going to have a new suit of clothes—without the shadow of a doubt a gaudy piratical uniform. Now a procession of ants appeared, from nowhere in particular, and went about their labors; one struggled manfully by with a dead spider five times as big as itself in its arms, and lugged it straight up a tree-trunk. A brown spotted lady-bug climbed the dizzy height of a grass blade, and Tom bent down close to it and said, “Lady-bug, lady-bug, fly away home, your house is on fire, your children’s alone,” and she took wing and went off to see about it—which did not surprise the boy, for he knew of old that this insect was credulous about conflagrations, and he had practised upon its simplicity more than once. A tumblebug came next, heaving sturdily at its ball, and Tom touched the creature, to see it shut its legs against its body and pretend to be dead. The birds were fairly rioting by this time. A catbird, the Northern mocker, lit in a tree over Tom’s head, and trilled out her imitations of her neighbors in a rapture of enjoyment; then a shrill jay swept down, a flash of blue flame, and stopped on a twig almost within the boy’s reach, cocked his head to one side and eyed the strangers with a consuming curiosity; a gray squirrel and a big fellow of the “fox” kind came skurrying along, sitting up at intervals to inspect and chatter at the boys, for the wild things had probably never seen a human being before and scarcely knew whether to be afraid or not. All Nature was wide awake and stirring, now; long lances of sunlight pierced down through the dense foliage far and near, and a few butterflies came fluttering upon the scene.",

Gradually the sounds multiplied and deepened—the faint stir of breezes, the rustling of leaves as some small animal moved, the buzz of insects, the gentle plash of water when some tiny thing fell into the brook. Nature was awake and stirring now; the sounds were thicker of them that were near, and deeper and softer of them that were far away. Presently the wood-pecker's hammer became silent, and by and by the birds called no more; for the sun was come to gladden the world. Away in the bright sun, among the distant trees, a slender column of smoke curled aloft and disappeared. Tom's heart yearned toward it. He wished he could see the peaceful home it rose from; he wished he could see the mother fly around her morning duties; he wished he could see the busy father smoking his pipe at the door; he wished he could see the little children tumbling in the grass. He knew how the morning felt to them, better than his sisters did. He knew what a blessed thing it was to wake up in the morning and feel that the long dull grind was not to begin again till next Monday morning! Ah, that was liberty, that was enjoyment!

They were pirates now, searching for buried treasure, or perhaps Indians on the warpath, tracking a rival tribe. The woods were their kingdom, vast and mysterious, full of secrets only they could uncover. They found a fallen tree that served as a magnificent ship, sailing the green waves of the undergrowth. They discovered a small cave, dark and damp, which they immediately declared a robber's den, perfect for hiding ill-gotten gains. They talked of ghosts and goblins, of murders and hidden gold, their imaginations painting vivid pictures on the canvas of the sun-dappled forest floor. Tom, ever the leader, devised elaborate plans for capturing imaginary enemies and rescuing damsels in distress (though the damsels were conspicuously absent from their adventures). Huck, practical and knowledgeable about the ways of the wild, pointed out animal tracks and identified birds by their calls, grounding Tom's flights of fancy just enough to keep them tethered to the real world, albeit a real world seen through the glorious lens of boyhood adventure. They ate wild berries, drank from a clear spring, and felt utterly free, masters of their domain, with no school, no chores, and no Aunt Polly to curb their boundless spirits. The hours flew by unnoticed, each moment packed with the thrill of discovery and the joy of shared freedom. They were just boys, but in those woods, they were kings."

Yes, and they take loaves of bread and put quicksilver in ’em and set ’em afloat, and wherever there’s anybody that’s drownded, they’ll float right there and stop.”\n“Yes, I’ve heard about that,” said Joe. “I wonder what makes the bread do that.”\n“Oh, it ain’t the bread, so much,” said Tom; “I reckon it’s mostly what they say over it before they start it out.”\n“But they don’t say anything over it,” said Huck. “I’ve seen ’em and they don’t.”\n“Well, that’s funny,” said Tom. “But maybe they say it to themselves. Of course they do. Anybody might know that.”\nThe other boys agreed that there was reason in what Tom said, because an ignorant lump of bread, uninstructed by an incantation, could not be expected to act very intelligently when set upon an errand of such gravity.\n“By jings, I wish I was over there, now,” said Joe.\n“I do too,” said Huck. “I’d give heaps to know who it is.”\nThe boys still listened and watched. Presently a revealing thought flashed through Tom’s mind, and he exclaimed:\n“Boys, I know who’s drownded—it’s us!”\nThey felt like heroes in an instant. Here was a gorgeous triumph; they were missed; they were mourned; hearts were breaking on their account; tears were being shed; accusing memories of unkindness to these poor lost lads were rising up, and unavailing regrets and remorse were being indulged; and best of all, the departed were the talk of the whole town, and the envy of all the boys, as far as this dazzling notoriety was concerned. This was fine. It was worth while to be a pirate, after all.",

Their hearts swelled, they were so proud. A sort of awe crept into their faces. Soon they were able to speak, and they did speak; but only in subdued tones, as befitted men who were assisting at a great public solemnity.\n“By jings,” said Tom, “I never thought of that.”\n“Why, it’s just the grandest thing that ever was!” said Joe.\n“I don’t say it ain’t,” said Huck. “I wish Tom Sawyer was here, he’d see mighty quick what it means.”\n“Huck, you’re right,” said Tom. “It *is* us!”\n“We’re drownded!—we’re drownded!” they cried, in a sort of ecstasy. “Oh, be joyful!”\n“They’ve missed us ever so long,” said Huck. “I reckon they haven’t had a bite to eat since yesterday.”\n“And they hain’t slept any,” added Tom.\n“They’ve been searching for us everywhere,” said Joe.\n“They hain’t got no comfort since we went,” said Huck.\n“They’ll be so glad when they find us,” said Tom, “and we’ll be heroes!

INACCURATE ELEMENTS:\n- The sequence of Tom's actions with the bark is slightly altered; the original specifies the order and method more precisely.\n- The completion attributes the use of a \"slate-pencil\" and \"charcoal\" as writing tools, which is inaccurate.\n- The process of selecting the bark is described differently, with invented details about tossing away bits of wood.\n- The completion changes the description of the marbles and omits the specific type mentioned in the original.\n- The order in which Tom places items in the hat and what he does with the hat is not fully accurate.\n\nTo improve, ensure all key actions and objects are included in the correct order, avoid inventing tools or steps not present in the original, and maintain the atmospheric and descriptive details that set the scene."

            "Soon, the ferry's bell rang, and the command to depart was given.",

Before the depth reached his middle he was halfway over; the current would permit no more wading, now, so he struck out confidently to swim the remaining hundred yards. He swam quartering upstream, but still was swept downward rather faster than he had expected. However, he reached the shore finally, and drifted along till he found a low place and drew himself out. He put his hand on his jacket pocket, found his piece of bark safe, and then struck through the woods, following the shore, with streaming garments. Shortly before ten o’clock he came out into an open place opposite the village, and saw the ferryboat lying in the shadow of the trees and the high bank. Everything was quiet under the blinking stars. He crept down the bank, watching with all his eyes, slipped into the water, swam three or four strokes and climbed into the skiff that did “yawl” duty at the boat’s stern. He laid himself down under the thwarts and waited, panting.\nPresently the cracked bell tapped and a voice gave the order to “cast off.” A minute or two later the skiff’s head was standing high up, against the boat’s swell, and the voyage was begun. Tom felt happy in his success, for he knew it was the boat’s last trip for the night. At the end of a long twelve or fifteen minutes the wheels stopped, and Tom slipped overboard and swam ashore in the dusk, landing fifty yards downstream, out of danger of possible stragglers.",

By and by he was close to the vestige of the old channel, and the water grew deeper, so he struck out and swam. He swam quartering upstream, but still the current set him down stream faster than he could make head against it. He presently landed on the Illinois side, near the foot of the island, and was considerable miled down stream by the time he got ashore. He went tiptoeing along the bar in the shallow water a little way, till he found a good place to climb the bank. He clambered up the bank through the dense willows, came out into a grassy open space, and sat down on a log to rest, wet and panting. A mosquito hummed in his ear and lit on his nose. He slapped at it and killed it. The smell of the moist earth and vegetation was fragrant and refreshing. There was a low hum of insects, and now and then a shrill chirp of some unknown creature that seemed to belong to the night. No sound else disturbed the stillness. He sat musing over his adventure past and to come, till the mosquitoes gathered in squadrons around him and dispersed his dreams. He got up and crashed his way through the thicket till he struck the shore above the foot of the island. He followed the shore to a point where a skiff was tied that he knew belonged to the ferry company. These skiffs were pulled up every night and fastened, but this one had broken its lashings and floated down stream. Tom knew about where the skiff belonged. He unfastened it from the willow and sprang in. He landed on the Missouri shore at the foot of the village, and tied the skiff there. He waded ashore through the ankle-deep water and stood upon the bank. He felt a great sense of relief and triumph. He was safe on shore, and he had accomplished his mission. He was wet and cold, but he did not mind. He was too excited to feel anything but joy. He looked up at the village. It was dark and still. Not a light was to be seen. Not a sound was to be heard. The village was asleep. Tom crept stealthily along the bank, keeping in the shadow of the trees. He was going to the house of his aunt Polly. He wanted to see what was going on there. He wanted to know if they had missed him. He wanted to know if they were grieving for him. He wanted to know if they thought he was dead. He reached the house and crept up to the window. He looked in. The room was dark. He could not see anything. He listened. He could hear the sound of someone sobbing. It was his aunt Polly. He could hear the sound of someone else sobbing. It was his cousin Mary. He could hear the sound of someone else sobbing. It was Sid. They were all there, and they were all crying. Tom's heart was touched. He had not thought they would care so much. He had not thought they would grieve for him. He had not thought they would think he was dead. He was glad he had come. He was glad he had seen them. He was glad he knew they cared. He crept away from the window and went back to the skiff. He untied it and got in. He pushed off from the shore and rowed out into the river. He rowed back to the island. He tied the skiff to the willow and got out. He went back to the camp. Huck and Joe were asleep. Tom lay down beside them and closed his eyes. He was tired, but he could not sleep. He kept thinking about what he had seen and heard. He kept thinking about his aunt Polly and Mary and Sid. He kept thinking about how much they cared.

He was grieved, and surprised, and gratified, and couldn’t make out how the foot of the bed happened to be so near his aunt’s nose. Presently he heard his aunt say:\n\n“Poor boy, poor boy, what did he want to grieve us for?”\n\n“I’ve been mighty hard on that child,” she sighed, to Mrs. Harper. “I couldn’t see it then, but it all comes back to me every little thing, it’s plain enough now. We hain’t ever thought of how awful it was for him, poor soul, when he was a-aching and a-sobbing, and hardly knew which way to turn for the Lord’s help, and nobody told him that the Lord would be his friend. Nobody spoke gentle to him, nobody tried to comfort him. It was always ‘mar that boy,’ and ‘mar this boy,’ and ‘don’t do that, sir,’ and ‘you answer me right now, sir,’ and always a-nagging and a-scolding, and a-hitting, too I’m afraid. Yes, often hitting, and not on account of wickedness, either, but just carelessness. Yes, I was too hard on the poor child! And now he’s gone, and I didn’t even see him die. He went out that door and I never saw him again.”\n\n“Oh, Huckleberry, my poor Huckleberry, I wish I had a-told him I loved him before he went,” said Mrs. Harper, crying. “I wish I had a-told him so, and I didn’t. It’s too late now, it’s too late.”\n\n“Yes, it’s too late,” sighed Aunt Polly. “He was a good boy, Huckleberry was, and I didn’t know it. I didn’t know it.

The minister, a solemn figure in black, stood in the pulpit, his voice resonating with sorrow as he spoke of the \"departed\" boys – Tom Sawyer, Huckleberry Finn, and Joe Harper. He recounted their brief lives, touching upon their mischievous spirits but emphasizing their underlying goodness, painting a picture of young lives tragically cut short. The congregation sighed and wept softly, sharing in the collective sorrow for the lost youths. The air was thick with the scent of wilting flowers and the heavy atmosphere of a funeral. Just as the minister reached the climax of his eulogy, describing the moment the boys were last seen, a faint sound came from the back of the church. Heads turned, eyes widened in disbelief. The large door creaked open, and there, bathed in the sunlight streaming through the entrance, stood the three \"corpses\" – Tom, Huck, and Joe – looking sheepish but undeniably alive. A gasp swept through the assembly, followed by a stunned silence that quickly erupted into a chaotic mixture of shouts, cries of joy, and fainting spells. Aunt Polly stared, her jaw dropping, before letting out a shriek of pure, unadulterated relief and rushing towards Tom. Mrs. Harper, moments ago a picture of despair, let out a cry of \"Joe!\" and surged forward. The funeral had become a resurrection, a scene of pandemonium and overwhelming happiness."

Indolence and solicitude were forgotten now, and he had all his faculties in lively exercise. He kept steadily up the stream, and when he had reached a point a mile above the village, he crossed over to the Illinois shore with a firm, vigorous stroke, and rowed along a shaded bank where wild grapevines hung in dense masses from the trees.

They were perfectly round white things a trifle smaller than an English walnut. They had a famous fried-egg feast that night, and another on Friday morning.\nAfter breakfast they went whooping and prancing out on the bar, and chased each other round and round, shedding clothes as they went, until they were naked, and then continued the frolic far away up the shoal water of the bar, against the stiff current, which latter tripped their legs from under them from time to time and greatly increased the fun. And now and then they stooped in a group and splashed water in each other’s faces with their palms, gradually approaching each other, with averted faces to avoid the strangling sprays, and finally gripping and struggling till the best man ducked his neighbor, and then they all went under in a tangle of white legs and arms and came up blowing, sputtering, laughing, and gasping for breath at one and the same time.\nWhen they were well exhausted, they would run out and sprawl on the dry, hot sand, and lie there and cover themselves up with it, and by and by break for the water again and go through the original performance once more. Finally it occurred to them that their naked skin represented flesh-colored “tights” very fairly; so they drew a ring in the sand and had a circus—with three clowns in it, for none would yield this proudest post to his neighbor.\nNext they got their marbles and played “knucks” and “ringtaw” and “keeps” till that amusement grew stale. Then Joe and Huck had another swim, but Tom would not venture, because he found that in kicking off his trousers he had kicked his string of rattlesnake rattles off his ankle, and he wondered how he had escaped cramp so long without the protection of this mysterious charm. He did not venture again until he had found it, and by that time the other boys were tired and ready to rest. They gradually wandered apart, dropped into the “dumps,” and fell to gazing longingly across the wide river to where the village lay drowsing in the sun. Tom found himself writing “BECKY” in the sand with his big toe; he scratched it out, and was angry with himself for his weakness. But he wrote it again, nevertheless; he could not help it.

They ran up and down the bar, and splashed each other, and wrestled and tumbled, and had a regular good time. They got so warm and tired that they lay down on the sand and covered themselves up with it, and then got up and went at it again. They played till they were tired, and then they lay down and rested. They got to imagining that their bare skin was flesh-colored tights, and they were circus performers. They had a circus, and each one wanted to be the clown. They played circus till they were tired of it, and then they played marbles till they were tired of it. Then Joe and Huck said they were going in for a swim, but Tom said he didn't know, he had lost his rattlesnake rattle. He wore it on his ankle for luck, and he was afraid he would get cramps if he went in without it. He hunted for it, and at last he found it. By that time Joe and Huck were tired and were resting. The boys lay there, thinking. They were tired and homesick. They looked across the wide river, and saw the village sleeping in the sun. A wave of homesickness swept over them. Tom got to writing in the sand with his toe. He wrote \"BECKY.\" He looked at it, and then he rubbed it out. He wrote it again, and rubbed it out again. He wrote it a third time, and then he got up and went to join the others. He was afraid he would write it again if he stayed there.",

MAJOR STRUCTURAL ISSUES:\n- The completion introduces a lengthy, invented sequence after the turtle egg hunt, focusing on an extended list of nighttime sounds and imagined events, which is not present in the original passage. This invented section replaces the actual sequence of activities and reflections that occur after the meal and egg hunt.\n- The completion omits the entire sequence of playful activities the boys engage in after breakfast, such as swimming, playing games, and staging a circus, which are central to the original passage.\n- The emotional and introspective moments, particularly Tom's actions and feelings toward the end, are missing.\n\n2. MISSING ELEMENTS:\n- The completion does not include the detailed description of the boys' morning activities, such as their playful frolicking, swimming, and the specific games they play.\n- The process of the boys becoming tired, resting, and gradually drifting into a more subdued mood is absent.\n- The passage omits the depiction of the boys' longing for home and Tom's personal moment involving writing in the sand.\n- The transition from group activities to individual reflection and then back to group interaction is not present.\n\n3. INACCURATE ELEMENTS:\n- The completion inaccurately extends the turtle egg hunt with invented dialogue and details about the eggs that are not in the original.\n- The timing and sequence of events are incorrect; the completion suggests the boys immediately return to camp and spend the night discussing supernatural topics, which does not align with the original order of events.\n- The completion attributes a series of invented auditory experiences and philosophical musings to the boys, which are not part of the original narrative.\n- The completion does not accurately represent the progression from evening to the next morning, nor does it capture the shift from energetic play to introspection and homesickness."

          "text_segment": "But Joe’s spirits had gone down almost beyond resurrection. He was so homesick that he could hardly endure the misery of it. The tears lay very near the surface. Huck was melancholy, too. Tom was downhearted, but tried hard not to show it. He had a secret which he was not ready to tell, yet, but if this mutinous depression was not broken up soon, he would have to bring it out. He said, with a great show of cheerfulness:\n“I bet there’s been pirates on this island before, boys. We’ll explore it again. They’ve hid treasures here somewhere. How’d you feel to light on a rotten chest full of gold and silver—hey?”\nBut it roused only faint enthusiasm, which faded out, with no reply. Tom tried one or two other seductions; but they failed, too. It was discouraging work. Joe sat poking up the sand with a stick and looking very gloomy. Finally he said:\n“Oh, boys, let’s give it up. I want to go home. It’s so lonesome.”\n“Oh no, Joe, you’ll feel better by and by,” said Tom. “Just think of the fishing that’s here.”\n“I don’t care for fishing. I want to go home.”\n“But, Joe, there ain’t such another swimming-place anywhere.”\n“Swimming’s no good. I don’t seem to care for it, somehow, when there ain’t anybody to say I sha’n’t go in. I mean to go home.”\n“Oh, shucks! Baby! You want to see your mother, I reckon.”\n“Yes, I do want to see my mother—and you would, too, if you had one. I ain’t any more baby than you are.” And Joe snuffled a little.\n“Well, we’ll let the crybaby go home to his mother, won’t we, Huck? Poor thing—does it want to see its mother? And so it shall. You like it here, don’t you, Huck? We’ll stay, won’t we?”\nHuck said, “Y-e-s”—without any heart in it.\n“I’ll never speak to you again as long as I live,” said Joe, rising. “There now!” And he moved moodily away and began to dress himself.\n“Who cares!” said Tom. “Nobody wants you to. Go ’long home and get laughed at. Oh, you’re a nice pirate. Huck and me ain’t crybabies. We’ll stay, won’t we, Huck? Let him go if he wants to. I reckon we can get along without him, per’aps.”\nBut Tom was uneasy, nevertheless, and was alarmed to see Joe go sullenly on with his dressing. And then it was discomforting to see Huck eying Joe’s preparations so wistfully, and keeping up such an ominous silence. Presently, without a parting word, Joe began to wade off toward the Illinois shore. Tom’s heart began to sink. He glanced at Huck. Huck could not bear the look, and dropped his eyes. Then he said:\n“I want to go, too, Tom. It was getting so lonesome anyway, and now it’ll be worse. Let’s us go, too, Tom.”\n“I won’t! You can all go, if you want to. I mean to stay.”\n“Tom, I better go.”\n“Well, go ’long—who’s hendering you.”\nHuck began to pick up his scattered clothes. He said:\n“Tom, I wisht you’d come, too. Now you think it over. We’ll wait for you when we get to shore.”\n“Well, you’ll wait a blame long time, that’s all.”\nHuck started sorrowfully away, and Tom stood looking after him, with a strong desire tugging at his heart to yield his pride and go along too. He hoped the boys would stop, but they still waded slowly on. It suddenly dawned on Tom that it was become very lonely and still. He made one final struggle with his pride, and then darted after his comrades, yelling:\n“Wait! Wait! I want to tell you something!”\nThey presently stopped and turned around. When he got to where they were, he began unfolding his secret, and they listened moodily till at last they saw the “point” he was driving at, and then they set up a warwhoop of applause and said it was “splendid!” and said if he had told them at first, they wouldn’t have started away. He made a plausible excuse; but his real reason had been the fear that not even the secret would keep them with him any very great length of time, and so he had meant to hold it in reserve as a last seduction.",

Then he could cheer up his comrades and banish melancholy from the island. Presently the thought occurred to him that there was no necessity for the boys to wait for their melancholy to be relieved. It was not necessary to wait for any faraway event. They could cheer up at once, if they chose. So he turned to Joe, and said:\n\n“What’s the matter, Joe?

          "text_segment": "The lads came gayly back and went at their sports again with a will, chattering all the time about Tom’s stupendous plan and admiring the genius of it. After a dainty egg and fish dinner, Tom said he wanted to learn to smoke, now. Joe caught at the idea and said he would like to try, too. So Huck made pipes and filled them. These novices had never smoked anything before but cigars made of grapevine, and they “bit” the tongue, and were not considered manly anyway.\nNow they stretched themselves out on their elbows and began to puff, charily, and with slender confidence. The smoke had an unpleasant taste, and they gagged a little, but Tom said:\n“Why, it’s just as easy! If I’d a knowed this was all, I’d a learnt long ago.”\n“So would I,” said Joe. “It’s just nothing.”\n“Why, many a time I’ve looked at people smoking, and thought well I wish I could do that; but I never thought I could,” said Tom.\n“That’s just the way with me, hain’t it, Huck? You’ve heard me talk just that way—haven’t you, Huck? I’ll leave it to Huck if I haven’t.”\n“Yes—heaps of times,” said Huck.\n“Well, I have too,” said Tom; “oh, hundreds of times. Once down by the slaughter-house. Don’t you remember, Huck? Bob Tanner was there, and Johnny Miller, and Jeff Thatcher, when I said it. Don’t you remember, Huck, ’bout me saying that?”\n“Yes, that’s so,” said Huck. “That was the day after I lost a white alley. No, ’twas the day before.”\n“There—I told you so,” said Tom. “Huck recollects it.”\n“I bleeve I could smoke this pipe all day,” said Joe. “I don’t feel sick.”\n“Neither do I,” said Tom. “I could smoke it all day. But I bet you Jeff Thatcher couldn’t.”\n“Jeff Thatcher! Why, he’d keel over just with two draws. Just let him try it once. He’d see!”\n“I bet he would. And Johnny Miller—I wish could see Johnny Miller tackle it once.”\n“Oh, don’t I!” said Joe. “Why, I bet you Johnny Miller couldn’t any more do this than nothing. Just one little snifter would fetch him.”\n“’Deed it would, Joe. Say—I wish the boys could see us now.”\n“So do I.”\n“Say—boys, don’t say anything about it, and some time when they’re around, I’ll come up to you and say, ‘Joe, got a pipe? I want a smoke.’ And you’ll say, kind of careless like, as if it warn’t anything, you’ll say, ‘Yes, I got my old pipe, and another one, but my tobacker ain’t very good.’ And I’ll say, ‘Oh, that’s all right, if it’s strong enough.’ And then you’ll out with the pipes, and we’ll light up just as ca’m, and then just see ’em look!”\n“By jings, that’ll be gay, Tom! I wish it was now!”\n“So do I! And when we tell ’em we learned when we was off pirating, won’t they wish they’d been along?”\n“Oh, I reckon not! I’ll just bet they will!”\nSo the talk ran on. But presently it began to flag a trifle, and grow disjointed. The silences widened; the expectoration marvellously increased. Every pore inside the boys’ cheeks became a spouting fountain; they could scarcely bail out the cellars under their tongues fast enough to prevent an inundation; little overflowings down their throats occurred in spite of all they could do, and sudden retchings followed every time. Both boys were looking very pale and miserable, now. Joe’s pipe dropped from his nerveless fingers. Tom’s followed. Both fountains were going furiously and both pumps bailing with might and main. Joe said feebly:\n“I’ve lost my knife. I reckon I better go and find it.”\nTom said, with quivering lips and halting utterance:\n“I’ll help you. You go over that way and I’ll hunt around by the spring. No, you needn’t come, Huck—we can find it.”\nSo Huck sat down again, and waited an hour. Then he found it lonesome, and went to find his comrades. They were wide apart in the woods, both very pale, both fast asleep. But something informed him that if they had had any trouble they had got rid of it.\nThey were not talkative at supper that night.",

After a good supper of hot roasted eggs and fresh fish, the boys made a fire against a great log twenty or thirty steps from their campfire, and fell to smoking. They had been hankering to do this several days. Joe and Tom had experimented a little with corn-silk pipes and grapevine cigars, and private corncob ones of the Pothos kind, and thought they might as well enjoy the real thing at once. Accordingly, Huck made pipes of clay and dried corn-cob, and filled them with tobacco. The three sat down and lit up. They had some difficulty getting started, and Tom said it was right easy when you got used to it. Joe said the same. They said that anybody could smoke that had the slightest feeling of spirit and pluck. That was agreeable, and they felt quite manly. They puffed in silence, presently, with grave faces and mnch exertion. The smoke began to hurt their throats. They coughed a little, and Huck willed the fire to blaze up and cheer them. They puffed on, diligently, but they fell into conversational gaps; the lively chattering grew fitful and uncertain. At short intervals they said \"Powerful sight of smoke, isn't it?\" or \"Looks like solid work, doesn't it?\"—with an air of having made an original discovery. At the next lull they struggled a while for something to say, and then Tom said:\n\n\"I reckon I'll find that knife now. I put it there myself.\" Joe said:\n\n\"Well, I'll help you. You want to come, Huck?\"\n\n\"No,\" said Huck, manfully struggling with the nausea, but suffering death just the same, \"leave me alone—I want to think.\" Well, they went off. Tom lay down first, under a tree, and Joe a moment after. They did not talk. They were feeling too miserable to talk. Presently Joe said:\n\n\"Tom, I wish I hadn't come.\" \"I don't ever want to see a pipe again,\" said Tom. \"I wish I was dead.\" \"So do I,\" said Joe. \"I wish I was dead, and in heaven.\" \"So do I,\" said Tom. \"There, now, that's something like.

The solemn hush continued. Beyond the light of the fire everything was swallowed up in the blackness of darkness. Presently there came a quivering glow that vaguely revealed the foliage for a moment and then vanished. By and by another came, a little stronger. Then another. Then a faint moan came sighing through the branches of the forest and the boys felt a fleeting breath upon their cheeks, and shuddered with the fancy that the Spirit of the Night had gone by. There was a pause. Now a weird flash turned night into day and showed every little grassblade, separate and distinct, that grew about their feet. And it showed three white, startled faces, too. A deep peal of thunder went rolling and tumbling down the heavens and lost itself in sullen rumblings in the distance. A sweep of chilly air passed by, rustling all the leaves and snowing the flaky ashes broadcast about the fire. Another fierce glare lit up the forest and an instant crash followed that seemed to rend the treetops right over the boys’ heads. They clung together in terror, in the thick gloom that followed.

Joe said his stomach hurt him, but it kept getting no better, it kept getting worse.\nPresently Joe said:\n“I feel awful. I wonder what the matter is? I feel like I was dying, Tom. Say, boys, let’s repent. We hain’t ever been bad till we did this.”\n“I hain’t kep’ track of nothin’,” said Huck, “but I reckon I’m as wicked as you are. If we git well, I lay I’ll turn over a new leaf and be good.”\n“Me too,” said Joe. “And we’ll never desert the island any more.”\n“And we’ll never smoke another pipe,” said Tom.\n“Nor swear again,” said Joe.\n“Nor gum,” said Huck.\n“Well, those ain’t no great things to give up, anyway,” said Tom. “But Huck, we’ll leave the raft to rot where she is. We’ll never cook any more stolen meat, and we’ll never do anything that ain’t honest and right. And we’ll be good, and we’ll pray every night, and—”\nHe stopped, for a sound like distant thunder came rolling o’er the sea.\n“What’s that?” whispered Huck.\n“I don’t know,” said Tom. “It don’t sound like thunder.”\n“No, it don’t,” said Joe. “It’s closer than thunder. I reckon it’s a steamboat.”\n“No, it ain’t,” said Tom. “It’s a boat, but it ain’t a steamboat. It’s a little boat, and it’s coming this way.”\nThey sat up and listened. The sound grew plainer and plainer. Presently they could hear the dip of oars.\n“It’s a boat,” said Tom. “And there’s somebody in it.”\nThey huddled together near the fire, feeling its comforting warmth, though the air was hot and still and suffocating. The deep gloom of the forest was heavy upon their spirits. Presently they heard a low moan that seemed to pass through the branches overhead.\n“What’s that?” whispered Huck.\n“I don’t know,” said Tom.\n“It’s the wind,” said Joe. “It’s rising.”\nThe wind sighed through the leaves, and a moment later a cold blast struck their faces. They shivered.\n“It’s the Spirit of the Night,” whispered Huck.\nA faint light appeared in the distance, and grew stronger. It seemed to be coming from the river.\n“It’s a lantern,” said Tom.\n“No, it ain’t,” said Joe. “It’s a fire.”\nThe light grew brighter and brighter. Presently they could see that it was a fire on a boat. The boat was coming this way.\n“It’s a steamboat,” said Tom.\n“No, it ain’t,” said Joe. “It’s a little boat, and there’s a fire on it.”\nThe boat came nearer and nearer. They could see that there were men in it. The men were standing up and looking this way.\n“They’re looking for us,” whispered Huck.\n“I reckon so,” said Tom.\nThe boat came close to the shore, and the men jumped out. They were carrying lanterns. They came up the bank and looked around.\n“They’re looking for us",

Huck lit his pipe and stretched out comfortably, blowing rings of smoke into the air. Tom and Joe watched him with a growing misery in their eyes. The smell of the burning 'weed' that had seemed so alluring and manly just hours before now turned their stomachs. They shifted uncomfortably, their faces growing paler by the minute. They tried to talk, to distract themselves, but the words caught in their throats. A cold sweat broke out on their foreheads. The island, the adventure, the pirate life—all the romance drained away, replaced by a desperate, gnawing nausea. Suddenly, simultaneously, they sprang up and bolted for the edge of the clearing, disappearing into the thick underbrush. Huck watched them go with a calm, experienced eye, puffing contentedly on his pipe. He knew what was happening. After a considerable time, they crept back, looking utterly wretched and defeated. Their pirate swagger was gone, replaced by the meekness of chastened schoolboys. They lay down silently, far apart, and stared miserably at the sky. The glorious dream of smoking like seasoned buccaneers had ended abruptly and violently. They had learned a harsh lesson about the realities of 'manly' habits. Neither of them mentioned tobacco again that night, nor for many nights to come. The pipe of peace, it turned out, was not for them."

A furious blast roared through the trees, making everything sing as it went. One blinding flash after another came, and peal on peal of deafening thunder. And now a drenching rain poured down and the rising hurricane drove it in sheets along the ground. The boys cried out to each other, but the roaring wind and the booming thunderblasts drowned their voices utterly. However, one by one they straggled in at last and took shelter under the tent, cold, scared, and streaming with water; but to have company in misery seemed something to be grateful for. They could not talk, the old sail flapped so furiously, even if the other noises would have allowed them. The tempest rose higher and higher, and presently the sail tore loose from its fastenings and went winging away on the blast. The boys seized each others’ hands and fled, with many tumblings and bruises, to the shelter of a great oak that stood upon the riverbank. Now the battle was at its highest. Under the ceaseless conflagration of lightning that flamed in the skies, everything below stood out in cleancut and shadowless distinctness: the bending trees, the billowy river, white with foam, the driving spray of spumeflakes, the dim outlines of the high bluffs on the other side, glimpsed through the drifting cloudrack and the slanting veil of rain. Every little while some giant tree yielded the fight and fell crashing through the younger growth; and the unflagging thunderpeals came now in ear-splitting explosive bursts, keen and sharp, and unspeakably appalling. The storm culminated in one matchless effort that seemed likely to tear the island to pieces, burn it up, drown it to the treetops, blow it away, and deafen every creature in it, all at one and the same moment. It was a wild night for homeless young heads to be out in.\nBut at last the battle was done, and the forces retired with weaker and weaker threatenings and grumblings, and peace resumed her sway. The boys went back to camp, a good deal awed; but they found there was still something to be thankful for, because the great sycamore, the shelter of their beds, was a ruin, now, blasted by the lightnings, and they were not under it when the catastrophe happened.\nEverything in camp was drenched, the campfire as well; for they were but heedless lads, like their generation, and had made no provision against rain. Here was matter for dismay, for they were soaked through and chilled. They were eloquent in their distress; but they presently discovered that the fire had eaten so far up under the great log it had been built against (where it curved upward and separated itself from the ground), that a handbreadth or so of it had escaped wetting; so they patiently wrought until, with shreds and bark gathered from the under sides of sheltered logs, they coaxed the fire to burn again. Then they piled on great dead boughs till they had a roaring furnace, and were gladhearted once more. They dried their boiled ham and had a feast, and after that they sat by the fire and expanded and glorified their midnight adventure until morning, for there was not a dry spot to sleep on, anywhere around.",

Tom saw the signs, and fell to cheering up the pirates as well as he could. But they cared nothing for marbles, or circus, or swimming, or anything. He reminded them of the imposing secret, and raised a ray of cheer. While it lasted, he got them interested in a new device. This was to knock off being pirates, for a while, and be Indians for a change. They were attracted by this idea; so it was not long before they were stripped, and striped from head to heel with black mud, like so many zebras—all of them chiefs, of course—and then they went tearing through the woods to attack an English settlement.\nBy and by they separated into three hostile tribes, and darted upon each other from ambush with dreadful warwhoops, and killed and scalped each other by thousands. It was a gory day. Consequently it was an extremely satisfactory one.\nThey assembled in camp toward suppertime, hungry and happy; but now a difficulty arose—hostile Indians could not break the bread of hospitality together without first making peace, and this was a simple impossibility without smoking a pipe of peace. There was no other process that ever they had heard of. Two of the savages almost wished they had remained pirates. However, there was no other way; so with such show of cheerfulness as they could muster they called for the pipe and took their whiff as it passed, in due form.\nAnd behold, they were glad they had gone into savagery, for they had gained something; they found that they could now smoke a little without having to go and hunt for a lost knife; they did not get sick enough to be seriously uncomfortable. They were not likely to fool away this high promise for lack of effort. No, they practised cautiously, after supper, with right fair success, and so they spent a jubilant evening. They were prouder and happier in their new acquirement than they would have been in the scalping and skinning of the Six Nations.

They were sluggish and简单, and their joints stiff, for they felt the effects of their night exposure and fellowship in crime. They came back to camp wonderfully depressed, and sat down with drooping heads and homesick hearts. The cheerful spirit of a fire was little comfort to them. Tom was for marbles, Joe was for fishing, Huck was for swimming, but none of them was for anything very strenuously. The spirt was gone out of all their amusements. In the afternoon they listlessly played at \"pirates,\" and wound up with an unsatisfactory \"slaughter\" of Innocents, which they were much too lazy to be cruel about. They were so utterly miserable that Tom's great secret plan was nearly forgotten. But not quite. At last, when the afternoon was waning, Tom said:\n\n\"Looky here, you fellows, this ain't no kind of a life. We're just moping around and doing nothing. We ought to be up and stirring. We ought to be having fun. I know what we'll do. We'll be Indians!\"\n\nThis was a new idea, and it took. They were Indians in a minute. They stripped off their clothes and daubed themselves with mud from head to foot, and then they were zebras, so to speak, and each of them a chief. They had a war-dance, and then they ran whooping and yelling through the woods, pretending to attack an English settlement, and scalping and tomahawking imaginary enemies. Then they divided up into three hostile tribes and had a war, and ambushed each other and slew and scalped thousands. It was a gory day. Tom and Joe were the Pequots, and Huck was the Pawnees. They fought till they were tired, and then they went back to camp, hungry and content. As the sun was going down, they gathered around the fire and prepared their supper. They were very hungry, and the smell of the cooking meat was very good. They ate their supper, and then they sat around the fire and talked. They were very tired, and they were very happy. They had had a good day. They had been Indians, and they had had a war, and they had killed and scalped thousands of enemies. They were very proud of themselves. They were real Indians.

They got up refreshed, a couple of hours later, and set about getting breakfast. They were sluggish and简单, and their joints stiff, for they felt the effects of their night exposure and fellowship in crime. They came back to camp wonderfully depressed, and sat down with drooping heads and homesick hearts. The cheerful spirit of a fire was little comfort to them. Tom was for marbles, Joe was for fishing, Huck was for swimming, but none of them was for anything very strenuously. The spirt was gone out of all their amusements. In the afternoon they listlessly played at \"pirates,\" and wound up with an unsatisfactory \"slaughter\" of Innocents, which they were much too lazy to be cruel about. They were so utterly miserable that Tom's great secret plan was nearly forgotten. But not quite. At last, when the afternoon was waning, Tom said:\n\n\"Looky here, you fellows, this ain't no kind of a life. We're just moping around and doing nothing. We ought to be up and stirring. We ought to be having fun. I know what we'll do. We'll be Indians!\"\n\nThis was a new idea, and it took. They were Indians in a minute. They stripped off their clothes and daubed themselves with mud from head to foot, and then they were zebras, so to speak, and each of them a chief. They had a war-dance, and then they ran whooping and yelling through the woods, pretending to attack an English settlement, and scalping and tomahawking imaginary enemies. Then they divided up into three hostile tribes and had a war, and ambushed each other and slew and scalped thousands. It was a gory day. Tom and Joe were the Pequots, and Huck was the Pawnees. They fought till they were tired, and then they went back to camp, hungry and content. As the sun was going down, they gathered around the fire and prepared their supper. They were very hungry, and the smell of the cooking meat was very good. They ate their supper, and then they sat around the fire and talked. They were very tired, and they were very happy. They had had a good day. They had been Indians, and they had had a war, and they had killed and scalped thousands of enemies. They were very proud of themselves. They were real Indians.

The village seemed afflicted with a paralysis of sorrow. The villagers moved listlessly about, with absent looks and sighing often. The Saturday holiday seemed a burden to the children. They wandered aimlessly about, in pairs, with hands in pockets, and little interest in anything. Games were out of the question. They gradually settled down to sitting on fences and curbs, despondently kicking their heels. In front of the Harper house and Aunt Polly's stood groups of subdued women, whispering, now and then, and sighing oftener. The saddest silence reigned in the deserted schoolhouse yard. It was only deserted, though; it was not lifeless. One figure sat upon a bench looking forlorn and friendless. This was Becky Thatcher. She sat musing, with her elbows on her knees and her chin in her hands. She was thinking, with a morbid satisfaction, that she would never see Tom any more. The friendly noisiness of the children's plays was missing, and she realized what a comfort it had always been till now, and she saw the barrenness of life without it. She put her small hand to her mouth to keep from sobbing. If she could only have the brass andiron-knob again! But that was gone forever, like him that gave it. She had driven him away with a cruel word, and she had saved herself she did not know what agony by it, but she had ruined him and her own happiness along with him. The tears flowed now, she hid her face in her arms and abandoned herself to grief. She cried, she cried, and could not stop. Poor thing! she was going through suffering enough to dissolve a heart of stone. Anybody can cry, but it takes a person with a sense of humor to laugh with any gusto when there is anything to laugh at. The village was steeped in melancholy; the mourners for the drowned were not the only ones that sorrowed. Everybody sorrowed, for Tom was everybody's favorite. Why, his old teachers, the mildest and gentlest of creatures, had been heard to say, barely a week gone by, that he had certain qualities which they admired, and they were not without hope that he would yet make a respectable man. If this was not high praise from them, it was high praise from anybody. The only really well-off person in",

MAJOR STRUCTURAL ISSUES:\n- The completion invents several scenes and details not present in the original, such as descriptions of the publichouse being empty, idlers on street corners, and neighbors calling to offer comfort. These invented elements appear early and throughout the middle of the passage.\n- The completion omits a significant section from the latter part of the original, specifically the focus on Becky Thatcher's solitary experience, her internal reflections, and her emotional response.\n\n2. MISSING ELEMENTS:\n- The completion lacks the depiction of the villagers conducting their affairs with an absent-minded demeanor and the specific mention of their sighing.\n- The passage does not include the transition to the children gradually giving up their games, nor does it show the progression to Becky Thatcher's personal scene.\n- The internal monologue and emotional struggle of Becky Thatcher, including her specific regrets and sorrow, are missing from the latter part of the completion.\n\n3. INACCURATE ELEMENTS:\n- The completion inaccurately describes the actions and settings of the villagers, such as stating that the Harpers and Aunt Polly's family are sitting in their homes draped in black, which is not specified in the original.\n- There is an incorrect sequence of events, as the completion focuses on invented public scenes and does not transition to the individual experience of Becky Thatcher as in the original.\n- The completion attributes actions and emotional states to groups and individuals that are not present in the original, such as neighbors calling to offer comfort and the specific behaviors of idlers and storekeepers."

Or perhaps the ailing Judge Thatcher? The air grew heavy with suspense and a shared sense of dread. Soon, the news began to spread, passed from lip to lip with hushed solemnity.

If you could come over on a log to go to your funeral, you could have come over and give me a hint some way that you warn’t dead, but only run off.”\n“Yes, you could have done that, Tom,” said Mary; “and I believe you would if you had thought of it.”\n“Would you, Tom?” said Aunt Polly, her face lighting wistfully. “Say, now, would you, if you’d thought of it?”\n“I—well, I don’t know. ’Twould ’a’ spoiled everything.”\n“Tom, I hoped you loved me that much,” said Aunt Polly, with a grieved tone that discomforted the boy. “It would have been something if you’d cared enough to think of it, even if you didn’t do it.”\n“Now, auntie, that ain’t any harm,” pleaded Mary; “it’s only Tom’s giddy way—he is always in such a rush that he never thinks of anything.”\n“More’s the pity.

They had paddled over to the Missouri shore on a log, at dusk on Saturday, landing near the ferry-house, and had lain hidden in the woods back of it until nearly midnight, when the Steamboat came down, bound for St. Louis. They boarded her, bought deck passages, and “lay out” and slept, and next morning early they were out afoot and far up the river, guiding themselves by the blasts of the boat’s whistle. They landed finally, some fifteen or twenty miles above St. Louis, and waited for the down boat. She arrived, and they went aboard, and Tom bought cabin passages—the first they had ever had; it meant rank and dignity and ease. They pretended to be strangers, and they were; no one recognized them. They sat in the cabin and ate their breakfast with a ‘style’ that amazed and confounded their innocent souls, and then they got out a deck of cards and played euchre for clothes—that is, they would call a suit, and the winner of the trick got the privilege of naming the article of clothing the loser should take off. By the time they reached St. Louis they had a pile of clothes, and they were in their shirtsleeves.

They had paddled over to the Missouri shore on a log, at dusk on Saturday, landing near the ferry-house, and had lain hidden in the woods back of it until nearly midnight, when the Steamboat came down, bound for St. Louis. They boarded her, bought deck passages, and “lay out” and slept, and next morning early they were out afoot and far up the river, guiding themselves by the blasts of the boat’s whistle. They landed finally, some fifteen or twenty miles above St. Louis, and waited for the down boat. She arrived, and they went aboard, and Tom bought cabin passages—the first they had ever had; it meant rank and dignity and ease. They pretended to be strangers, and they were; no one recognized them. They sat in the cabin and ate their breakfast with a ‘style’ that amazed and confounded their innocent souls, and then they got out a deck of cards and played euchre for clothes—that is, they would call a suit, and the winner of the trick got the privilege of naming the article of clothing the loser should take off. By the time they reached St. Louis they had a pile of clothes, and they were in their shirtsleeves.

They had paddled over to the Missouri shore on a log, at dusk on Saturday, and had lain hidden in the woods back of it until nearly midnight, when they slipped into the village and to the church, and slept in the gallery. On Monday morning, the house was still gloomy. Aunt Polly and Mary were very kind and gentle and solicitous with Tom, and they would not allow him to do anything, but waited on him and did all the chores themselves. It was like being a guest. Presently, when breakfast was over, and they were sitting down comfortably, Aunt Polly said, with a sigh and a frown: “Tom, I’ve a notion, I’ve a notion to skin you alive!” “I don’t deserve it, Aunt Polly.” “You don’t deserve it? You don’t deserve it? What have you done, you ungrateful boy? What have you done? But never mind, it’s no matter now. It only makes my heart ache to think of it. A week ago you were in this very room, and I was scolding you, and you were saucy, and I never thought I should see you again. And now—now you are here, and I am so thankful, oh, so thankful! But I can’t help wishing you had thought of us—of me—and sent me some word. It would have been so easy. And you know you could have done it, Tom. You know you could have done it if you had tried. You know how I suffered.” Tom hung his head. “Aunt Polly, I couldn’t help it. It wouldn’t have been any fun if I had.” “Fun? Fun? Oh, Tom, it was cruel! It was cruel to us all. And you know how I love you, Tom, and how I have always loved you, and how I have always tried to do my duty by you, and how I have always tried to bring you up right, and how I have always tried to make you a good boy, and how I have always tried to make you happy, and how I have always tried to make you comfortable, and how I have always tried to make you contented, and how I have always tried to make you satisfied, and how I have always tried to make you grateful, and how I have always tried to make you obedient, and how I have always tried to make you respectful, and how I have always tried to make you truthful, and how I have always tried to make you honest, and how I have always tried to make you virtuous, and how I have always tried to make you religious, and how I have always tried to make you pious, and how I have always tried to make you devout, and how I have always tried to make you holy, and how I have always tried to make you pure, and",

MAJOR STRUCTURAL ISSUES:\n- The completion invents an extensive sequence involving steamboat travel, card games, hotel stays, and visits to the theatre, none of which are present in the original passage. These invented events replace the actual, much simpler sequence of the boys' return.\n- The completion omits the entire breakfast scene with Aunt Polly and Mary, which is a significant portion of the original passage and contains important dialogue and emotional exchanges.\n- The ending devolves into a repetitive, nonsensical list that is not present in the original and does not reflect any actual narrative or character development.\n\n2. MISSING ELEMENTS:\n- The completion lacks the specific details about how the boys returned to the village, including the timing, the method of travel, and where they hid upon arrival.\n- There is no mention of the boys sleeping in the woods or in the church gallery, which are key steps in the original sequence.\n- The entire breakfast conversation, including the emotional responses and dialogue between Tom, Aunt Polly, and Mary, is missing.\n- The nuanced discussion about Tom's actions, Aunt Polly's feelings, and Mary's defense of Tom is absent.\n\n3. INACCURATE ELEMENTS:\n- The completion provides incorrect locations, times, and methods of travel, such as referencing a ferry-house, steamboat journeys, and distant landings, which do not align with the original events.\n- The sequence of events is altered, with invented activities (e.g., playing cards for clothes, hotel stays, theatre visits) inserted in place of the actual events.\n- The emotional focus and character interactions are replaced by a generic and repetitive list, losing the specific emotional tone and character dynamics present in the original passage."

What did you dream?”\n“Why, Wednesday night I dreamt that you was sitting over there by the bed, and Sid was sitting by the woodbox, and Mary next to him.”\n“Well, so we did. So we always do. I’m glad your dreams could take even that much trouble about us.”\n“And I dreamt that Joe Harper’s mother was here.”\n“Why, she was here! Did you dream any more?”\n“Oh, lots. But it’s so dim, now.”\n“Well, try to recollect—can’t you?”\n“Somehow it seems to me that the wind—the wind blowed the—the—”\n“Try harder, Tom! The wind did blow something. Come!”\nTom pressed his fingers on his forehead an anxious minute, and then said:\n“I’ve got it now! I’ve got it now! It blowed the candle!”\n“Mercy on us!

Go on!”\n“And then—and then—well I won’t be certain, but it seems like as if you made Sid go and—and—”\n“Well? Well? What did I make him do, Tom? What did I make him do?”\n“You made him—you—Oh, you made him shut it.”\n“Well, for the land’s sake! I never heard the beat of that in all my days! Don’t tell me there ain’t anything in dreams, any more. Sereny Harper shall know of this before I’m an hour older. I’d like to see her get around this with her rubbage ’bout superstition. Go on, Tom!”\n“Oh, it’s all getting just as bright as day, now. Next you said I warn’t bad, only mischeevous and harum-scarum, and not any more responsible than—than—I think it was a colt, or something.”\n“And so it was! Well, goodness gracious! Go on, Tom!”\n“And then you began to cry.”\n“So I did. So I did. Not the first time, neither. And then—”\n“Then Mrs. Harper she began to cry, and said Joe was just the same, and she wished she hadn’t whipped him for taking cream when she’d throwed it out her own self—”\n“Tom! The sperrit was upon you! You was a prophesying—that’s what you was doing! Land alive, go on, Tom!”\n“Then Sid he said—he said—”\n“I don’t think I said anything,” said Sid.\n“Yes you did, Sid,” said Mary.\n“Shut your heads and let Tom go on! What did he say, Tom?”\n“He said—I think he said he hoped I was better off where I was gone to, but if I’d been better sometimes—”\n“There, d’you hear that! It was his very words!”\n“And you shut him up sharp.”\n“I lay I did! There must ’a’ been an angel there. There was an angel there, somewheres!”\n“And Mrs. Harper told about Joe scaring her with a firecracker, and you told about Peter and the Pain-killer—”\n“Just as true as I live!”\n“And then there was a whole lot of talk ’bout dragging the river for us, and ’bout having the funeral Sunday, and then you and old Miss Harper hugged and cried, and she went.”\n“It happened just so! It happened just so, as sure as I’m a-sitting in these very tracks. Tom, you couldn’t told it more like if you’d ’a’ seen it! And then what? Go on, Tom!”\n“Then I thought you prayed for me—and I could see you and hear every word you said. And you went to bed, and I was so sorry that I took and wrote on a piece of sycamore bark, ‘We ain’t dead—we are only off being pirates,’ and put it on the table by the candle; and then you looked so good, laying there asleep, that I thought I went and leaned over and kissed you on the lips.”\n“Did you, Tom, did you!

Tom always had a knack for turning misfortune into a spectacle, for garnering pity and admiration where Sid received only quiet approval. He suspected, with a growing certainty, that Tom hadn't merely dreamed this terrible vision. He wondered if Tom had actually *seen* something, if he had been present at the scene of the crime and was now using the guise of a nightmare to reveal what he knew without admitting his presence. It was just like Tom to find a dramatic, roundabout way to handle things.

Now that he was distinguished, maybe she would be wanting to “make up.” Well, let her—she should see that he could be as indifferent as some other people. Presently she arrived. Tom pretended not to see her. He moved away and joined a group of boys and girls and began to talk. Soon he observed that she was tripping gayly back and forth with flushed face and dancing eyes, pretending to be busy chasing schoolmates, and screaming with laughter when she made a capture; but he noticed that she always made her captures in his vicinity, and that she seemed to cast a conscious eye in his direction at such times, too. It gratified all the vicious vanity that was in him; and so, instead of winning him, it only “set him up” the more and made him the more diligent to avoid betraying that he knew she was about. Presently she gave over skylarking, and moved irresolutely about, sighing once or twice and glancing furtively and wistfully toward Tom. Then she observed that now Tom was talking more particularly to Amy Lawrence than to any one else. She felt a sharp pang and grew disturbed and uneasy at once. She tried to go away, but her feet were treacherous, and carried her to the group instead. She said to a girl almost at Tom’s elbow—with sham vivacity:\n“Why, Mary Austin! you bad girl, why didn’t you come to Sunday-school?”\n“I did come—didn’t you see me?”\n“Why, no! Did you? Where did you sit?”\n“I was in Miss Peters’ class, where I always go. I saw you.”\n“Did you? Why, it’s funny I didn’t see you. I wanted to tell you about the picnic.”\n“Oh, that’s jolly. Who’s going to give it?”\n“My ma’s going to let me have one.”\n“Oh, goody; I hope she’ll let me come.”\n“Well, she will. The picnic’s for me. She’ll let anybody come that I want, and I want you.”\n“That’s ever so nice. When is it going to be?”\n“By and by. Maybe about vacation.”\n“Oh, won’t it be fun! You going to have all the girls and boys?”\n“Yes, every one that’s friends to me—or wants to be”; and she glanced ever so furtively at Tom, but he talked right along to Amy Lawrence about the terrible storm on the island, and how the lightning tore the great sycamore tree “all to flinders” while he was “standing within three feet of it.”\n“Oh, may I come?” said Grace Miller.\n“Yes.”\n“And me?” said Sally Rogers.\n“Yes.”\n“And me, too?” said Susy Harper. “And Joe?”\n“Yes.”\nAnd so on, with clapping of joyful hands till all the group had begged for invitations but Tom and Amy. Then Tom turned coolly away, still talking, and took Amy with him. Becky’s lips trembled and the tears came to her eyes; she hid these signs with a forced gayety and went on chattering, but the life had gone out of the picnic, now, and out of everything else; she got away as soon as she could and hid herself and had what her sex call “a good cry.” Then she sat moody, with wounded pride, till the bell rang. She roused up, now, with a vindictive cast in her eye, and gave her plaited tails a shake and said she knew what she’d do.",

At last he spied her, but there was a sudden falling of his mercury. She was sitting cosily on a little bench behind the schoolhouse looking at a picture-book with Alfred Temple—and so absorbed were they, and their heads so close together over the book, that they did not seem to be conscious of anything in the world besides. Jealousy ran red-hot through Tom’s veins. He began to hate himself for throwing away the chance Becky had offered for a reconciliation. He called himself a fool, and all the hard names he could think of. He wanted to cry with vexation. Amy chatted happily along, as they walked, for her heart was singing, but Tom’s tongue had lost its function. He did not hear what Amy was saying, and whenever she paused expectantly he could only stammer an awkward assent, which was as often misplaced as otherwise. He kept drifting to the rear of the schoolhouse, again and again, to sear his eyeballs with the hateful spectacle there. He could not help it. And it maddened him to see, as he thought he saw, that Becky Thatcher never once suspected that he was even in the land of the living. But she did see, nevertheless; and she knew she was winning her fight, too, and was glad to see him suffer as she had suffered.\nAmy’s happy prattle became intolerable. Tom hinted at things he had to attend to; things that must be done; and time was fleeting. But in vain—the girl chirped on. Tom thought, “Oh, hang her, ain’t I ever going to get rid of her?” At last he must be attending to those things—and she said artlessly that she would be “around” when school let out. And he hastened away, hating her for it.",

He was showing off with great effect, for he found Becky Thatcher watching him. He was so charmed with her suffering that he did not know what to do with himself. He wished she would turn white, but she kept part of her back to him, and seemed interested in nothing but Amy. He took occasion once or twice to look furtively at her face, and he thought he detected lines of pain around her mouth, but she was smiling, and she was chatting with her friends. Tom was enraged. He resolved to make her jealous. He redoubled his attentions to Amy, with apparent unconsciousness of Becky's presence. But when he stole another glance, she was laughing at something and in the next moment she was gone. This was disconcerting. Tom felt a sudden chill. He was entirely worthless to himself now, and indifferent to Amy. He tried to play boyish games, but they were tasteless. He presently wandered to the river the customary resort. But he found only some older boys there, and they ignored him. He dejectedly returned to the schoolhouse to see what was going on. He found Becky sitting on a log with Alfred Temple. The two were looking at a picture-book together. Tom's heart turned to ice. He stood gazing, and his face flushed and paled and flushed again. The two heads were together over the book and they were so close together that Tom could not bear the sight. He turned away and walked off, his hands clenched, his teeth set. He was so miserable that he could have cried. He was a fool, he said to himself, a fool to have rejected Becky's offer of reconciliation. He had lost her forever. He wandered aimlessly about, and presently found himself near the schoolhouse again. He saw Becky and Alfred still together. He could not understand it. He had thought Becky was his. He had thought she loved him. He had thought she would be miserable without him. But she was not. She was happy. She was laughing. She was talking to Alfred Temple. Tom was in despair.

He was thinking of Alfred Temple. He was thinking of how happy they were together. He was thinking of how miserable he was. He wished he were dead. Amy talked on, but Tom did not answer. He was staring straight ahead, his eyes fixed on nothing. Amy stopped talking and looked at him. \"Tom,\" she said, \"what is the matter?\" Tom did not answer.

Then Alfred went musing into the deserted schoolhouse. He was humiliated and angry. He easily guessed his way to the truth—the girl had simply made a convenience of him to vent her spite upon Tom Sawyer. He was far from hating Tom the less when this thought occurred to him. He wished there was some way to get that boy into trouble without much risk to himself. Tom’s spelling-book fell under his eye. Here was his opportunity. He gratefully opened to the lesson for the afternoon and poured ink upon the page.\nBecky, glancing in at a window behind him at the moment, saw the act, and moved on, without discovering herself.

She resolved to let him get whipped on the damaged spelling-book’s account, and to hate him forever, into the bargain.",

It was sad enough, for a treasure was hidden in the lining of one of the sleeves. She ripped it open, and there sure enough was the great lump of coarse, yellow paper that was Tom's \"certificate.\" It was a torn piece of a \"dime novel\" cover, gloriously illustrated with a slanting shipwreck, and a tempest, and a lightning flash. The border was rudely ornamented with skull and crossbones. In the center was the shabby and ragged black space where the original title of the dime novel had been, and above it the words \"BLOODY FIN\" had been written with a pen dipped in red ink for blood. The words \"BLOODY FIN\" were underlined with the same horrible stuff. The certificate had been drawn up at the camp the day Tom was \"pirate.\" It declared that \"BLOODY FIN, ADVENTURER,\" was not to be hanged, but was to have his life spared because he had \"saved the life of the INJUN PETER, and he was to be allowed to go free, and he was to have a hundred dollars and a new gun.\" This was all written in Tom's own hand, and it was signed \"BLOODY FIN, his mark.\" The mark was a cross. Below it was written \"Witness, HUCK FINN, his mark.\" The mark was a cross. Below that was written \"Witness, JO HARPER, his mark.\" The mark was a cross. She knew the handwriting and the marks. She knew the paper. She knew the story. It was all clear to her now. She put the certificate back in the lining and sewed it up again. She put the jacket back in the closet. She sat down and cried."

Without a moment’s hesitation he ran to her and said:\n“I acted mighty mean today, Becky, and I’m so sorry. I won’t ever, ever do that way again, as long as ever I live—please make up, won’t you?”\nThe girl stopped and looked him scornfully in the face:\n“I’ll thank you to keep yourself to yourself, Mr. Thomas Sawyer. I’ll never speak to you again.”\nShe tossed her head and passed on. Tom was so stunned that he had not even presence of mind enough to say “Who cares, Miss Smarty?” until the right time to say it had gone by. So he said nothing. But he was in a fine rage, nevertheless. He moped into the schoolyard wishing she were a boy, and imagining how he would trounce her if she were. He presently encountered her and delivered a stinging remark as he passed. She hurled one in return, and the angry breach was complete. It seemed to Becky, in her hot resentment, that she could hardly wait for school to “take in,” she was so impatient to see Tom flogged for the injured spelling-book.

The darling of his desires was, to be a doctor, but poverty had decreed that he should be nothing higher than a village schoolmaster. Every day he took a mysterious book out of his desk and absorbed himself in it at times when no classes were reciting. He kept that book under lock and key. There was not an urchin in school but was perishing to have a glimpse of it, but the chance never came. Every boy and girl had a theory about the nature of that book; but no two theories were alike, and there was no way of getting at the facts in the case. Now, as Becky was passing by the desk, which stood near the door, she noticed that the key was in the lock! It was a precious moment. She glanced around; found herself alone, and the next instant she had the book in her hands. The titlepage—Professor Somebody’s Anatomy—carried no information to her mind; so she began to turn the leaves. She came at once upon a handsomely engraved and colored frontispiece—a human figure, stark naked. At that moment a shadow fell on the page and Tom Sawyer stepped in at the door and caught a glimpse of the picture. Becky snatched at the book to close it, and had the hard luck to tear the pictured page half down the middle. She thrust the volume into the desk, turned the key, and burst out crying with shame and vexation.",

She remembered that the master's desk was always locked, and wondered what was the matter. She pushed it again, and the creak came again.

Then he’ll do just the way he always does—ask first one and then t’other, and when he comes to the right girl he’ll know it, without any telling. Girls’ faces always tell on them. They ain’t got any backbone. She’ll get licked. Well, it’s a kind of a tight place for Becky Thatcher, because there ain’t any way out of it.” Tom conned the thing a moment longer, and then added: “All right, though; she’d like to see me in just such a fix—let her sweat it out!”",

Most of the pupils glanced up languidly, but there were two among them that watched his movements with intent eyes. Mr. Dobbins fingered his book absently for a while, then took it out and settled himself in his chair to read! Tom shot a glance at Becky. He had seen a hunted and helpless rabbit look as she did, with a gun levelled at its head. Instantly he forgot his quarrel with her. Quick—something must be done! done in a flash, too! But the very imminence of the emergency paralyzed his invention. Good!—he had an inspiration! He would run and snatch the book, spring through the door and fly. But his resolution shook for one little instant, and the chance was lost—the master opened the volume. If Tom only had the wasted opportunity back again! Too late. There was no help for Becky now, he said. The next moment the master faced the school. Every eye sank under his gaze. There was that in it which smote even the innocent with fear. There was silence while one might count ten—the master was gathering his wrath. Then he spoke: “Who tore this book?”\nThere was not a sound. One could have heard a pin drop. The stillness continued; the master searched face after face for signs of guilt.\n“Benjamin Rogers, did you tear this book?”\nA denial. Another pause.\n“Joseph Harper, did you?”\nAnother denial. Tom’s uneasiness grew more and more intense under the slow torture of these proceedings.

By and by, Mr. Dobbins roused himself, unlocked his desk, and got out his book, a big, square book, with brass clasps. Everybody knew what book that was; and everybody wrinkled his nose at the thought of its ancient and unsavory contents. The boys had peeped into it now and then and knew that the blood-curdling pictures of human anatomy, carefully labeled, were in it. So they considered it a pretty worthless sort of a book at best. The master handled it tenderly, and caressed it with his hand, and held it up to the light and smoothed it, first on this side, then on that. Then he opened it, and began to turn the leaves, occasionally glancing at the school with a mild, abstracted expression. Presently a less abstracted expression stole into his face, then an expression of perplexity, then of disappointment, and finally of anger. He was turning over the leaves of the great Grays Anatomy with loving care, and a miniature of Becky Thatcher had fluttered out on the floor. Also, on the next page, a like miniature of Tom Sawyer. The master stared at the pictures a moment, then picked them up and deliberately tore them in two. The school all saw it. The boys and girls had been watching, since the master began to handle his book, with an interest they had rarely felt before. When he tore the pictures, the interest grew intense. A breathless silence fell upon the school. The master's face grew black with passion. He rose, and stood glaring at the school. Every eye was bent upon him, and every heart was beating with fear. He opened his mouth to speak, but the words did not come. He tried again, but the words were choked back. He reeled, and grasped the desk for support. The school was in a panic. The master's face was as white as a sheet. He stood for a moment, trembling, then sank into his chair. The school was silent, waiting. The master's eyes were closed. He sat for a long time, then slowly opened his eyes. He looked at the school, and his face was calm. He rose, and stood before the school. He looked at the school, and his face was calm.

By and by, Mr. Dobbins roused himself, unlocked his desk, and got out his book, a big, square book, with brass clasps. Everybody knew what book that was; and everybody wrinkled his nose at the thought of its ancient and unsavory contents. The boys had peeped into it now and then and knew that the blood-curdling pictures of human anatomy, carefully labeled, were in it. So they considered it a pretty worthless sort of a book at best. The master handled it tenderly, and caressed it with his hand, and held it up to the light and smoothed it, first on this side, then on that. Then he opened it, and began to turn the leaves, occasionally glancing at the school with a mild, abstracted expression. Presently a less abstracted expression stole into his face, then an expression of perplexity, then of disappointment, and finally of anger. He was turning over the leaves of the great Grays Anatomy with loving care, and a miniature of Becky Thatcher had fluttered out on the floor. Also, on the next page, a like miniature of Tom Sawyer. The master stared at the pictures a moment, then picked them up and deliberately tore them in two. The school all saw it. The boys and girls had been watching, since the master began to handle his book, with an interest they had rarely felt before. When he tore the pictures, the interest grew intense. A breathless silence fell upon the school. The master's face grew black with passion. He rose, and stood glaring at the school. Every eye was bent upon him, and every heart was beating with fear. He opened his mouth to speak, but the words did not come. He tried again, but the words were choked back. He reeled, and grasped the desk for support. The school was in a panic. The master's face was as white as a sheet. He stood for a moment, trembling, then sank into his chair. The school was silent, waiting. The master's eyes were closed. He sat for a long time, then slowly opened his eyes. He looked at the school, and his face was calm. He rose, and stood before the school. He looked at the school, and his face was calm.

His rod and his ferule were seldom idle now—at least among the smaller pupils. Only the biggest boys, and young ladies of eighteen and twenty, escaped lashing. Mr. Dobbins’ lashings were very vigorous ones, too; for although he carried, under his wig, a perfectly bald and shiny head, he had only reached middle age, and there was no sign of feebleness in his muscle. As the great day approached, all the tyranny that was in him came to the surface; he seemed to take a vindictive pleasure in punishing the least shortcomings. The consequence was, that the smaller boys spent their days in terror and suffering and their nights in plotting revenge. They threw away no opportunity to do the master a mischief. But he kept ahead all the time. The retribution that followed every vengeful success was so sweeping and majestic that the boys always retired from the field badly worsted. At last they conspired together and hit upon a plan that promised a dazzling victory. They swore in the signpainter’s boy, told him the scheme, and asked his help. He had his own reasons for being delighted, for the master boarded in his father’s family and had given the boy ample cause to hate him. The master’s wife would go on a visit to the country in a few days, and there would be nothing to interfere with the plan; the master always prepared himself for great occasions by getting pretty well fuddled, and the signpainter’s boy said that when the dominie had reached the proper condition on Examination Evening he would “manage the thing” while he napped in his chair; then he would have him awakened at the right time and hurried away to school.",

A multitude of children were gathered, and their parents and friends. The superintendent was there, with a smile of gratified vanity, and his proudest minister, and the school committee. All the great dignitaries of the village were present, and Tom Sawyer was there, looking pale and miserable. He had been dreading this day for weeks. He had accumulated his tickets, not by diligent study, but by trading with other boys for marbles, fish-hooks, and other treasures. He had exactly the number required for a Bible – two thousand tickets. He clutched them in his sweaty hand, a bundle of ill-gotten gains that felt heavier than lead. The superintendent, Mr. Walters, a bland, sleek man, stood up and beamed upon the assembly. He made a long speech about the glory of the Sunday-school, the importance of religious education, and the magnificent prize that awaited the most diligent scholar – a splendidly bound Bible. He spoke of the difficulty of earning this prize, how few had ever achieved it, and how it represented years of tireless effort and perfect recitation. Tom felt a cold dread creep over him. He knew he couldn't answer a single question about the Bible. But he had the tickets. Mr. Walters finished his speech and announced that he would now call forward the scholar who had earned the Bible. There was a hush of anticipation. Tom's heart hammered against his ribs. He saw the proud, knowing looks on the faces of the few boys who actually knew their lessons. Then, in a voice that seemed to boom through the room, Mr. Walters called out, \"Thomas Sawyer!\" A gasp went through the crowd. Tom, trembling but determined, rose from his seat and walked to the front, clutching his tickets."

No matter what the subject might be, a brainracking effort was made to squirm it into some aspect or other that the moral and religious mind could contemplate with edification. The glaring insincerity of these sermons was not sufficient to compass the banishment of the fashion from the schools, and it is not sufficient today; it never will be sufficient while the world stands, perhaps. There is no school in all our land where the young ladies do not feel obliged to close their compositions with a sermon; and you will find that the sermon of the most frivolous and the least religious girl in the school is always the longest and the most relentlessly pious.

Into the midst of these compositions—as if by accident, and coming in from the outside, as it were—sprang occasional sentences of religious exhortation, as if the writer had suddenly remembered that she was expected to be pious, and had dashed in a spoonful of that sentiment, to be presently followed by another and another, till the two or three pages of original matter were freighted with it. And yet, always, the most insipid composition was the one where the most effort had been made to be pious. This was a sort of habit that had been long ago contracted, and it had become a fixed feature in the schools, and it is likely to remain so always, for it is a habit that is not easily broken. The young ladies themselves did not seem to mind it, for they were used to it; but the audience did, and it was a pity that they could not have been spared it. The truth is, that the young ladies were not to blame for this state of things; they were merely following the fashion, and the fashion was set by their mothers and grandmothers, and it had come down from the time of the Crusades.

Then followed the reading of compositions—after which the spelling-class was called, and they went from word to word up and down the list and gained marks position. The Latin class recited with honor. The great feature of the evening was in order now—original “compositions” by the young ladies. Each in her turn stepped forward to the edge of the platform, cleared her throat, held up her manuscript (tied with dainty ribbon), and proceeded to read, with labored breathing and dolorous emphasis, a “composition.” The themes were the same that had been illuminated upon similar occasions by the young ladies of St. Louis and every other village or city, the country over, for many generations. There was no getting away from it. Therefore, the despair of the saints on the score of original composition is universal. The themes treated of were, “Friendship,” “Memories of Other Days,” “Religion in History,” “Dream Land,” “The Advantages of Culture,” “Forms of Political Government Compared and Contrasted,” “Melancholy,” “Filial Love,” “Heart Longings,” etc., etc. A prevalent characteristic of these compositions was a cultivated and cherished melancholy; another was a wasteful and opulent gush of “fine” words; another was a tendency to lug in, without necessity, and whenever there was an opportunity, the most cherished words and phrases and wear them threadbare; and another was the habitual and intolerable sermon that wagged its tail at the end of all of them. No matter what the subject might be, the sermon was sure to come. The most trivial topic was treated with all the solemnity of a funeral oration, and the most commonplace sentiment was clothed in the most ornate and pompous phraseology. The sermon was always tacked on, and it was always the same sermon. It was a sort of habit that had been long ago contracted, and it had become a fixed feature in the schools, and it is likely to remain so always, for it is a habit that is not easily broken.

The truth is, that in every school in the land, there is a young lady who is the most superficial and least religious girl in the school, and she is the one who writes the longest and most ardently pious sermon. The truth is, that homely truth is unpalatable.",
                "refinement_prompt": "IMPROVEMENT GUIDANCE:\n1. MAJOR STRUCTURAL ISSUES:\n- The completion invents a detailed narrative about a \"slender boy\" who died in Jerusalem, which is not present in the original passage. This invented story disrupts the flow and focus of the original, which instead describes the general nature of the compositions rather than recounting a specific example.\n- There is a significant repetition of a single sentence about the young ladies not being to blame and the fashion being set by their ancestors. This repeated block is not present in the original and interrupts the passage's progression.\n\n2. MISSING ELEMENTS:\n- The completion omits the description of the reading exercises and the spelling fight that occur before the Latin class recitation. These are important steps in the sequence of the evening's events.\n- The original includes a detailed critique of the compositions, highlighting specific recurring features such as excessive use of ornate language, forced inclusion of favored words, and the obligatory moralizing conclusion. These categories of critique are only partially represented or are replaced with invented characteristics in the completion.\n- The original passage ends with a broader commentary on the persistence of the sermonizing habit and its insincerity, as well as a closing remark about the unpalatability of homely truth. These reflective elements are missing or replaced by repetitive statements in the completion.\n\n3. INACCURATE ELEMENTS:\n- The sequence of events is altered: the completion places the reading of compositions before the spelling fight, whereas the original has a different order.\n- The completion attributes certain features to the compositions (such as an \"ostentatious and gushing affection for history\" and excessive alliteration) that are not the focus of the original's critique.\n- The description of how religious content is inserted into the compositions is inaccurate; the completion suggests it is done sporadically and as an afterthought, while the original describes it as a consistent and formulaic conclusion.\n- The completion misrepresents the universality and historical continuity of the themes by focusing on a specific location and by repeating the same justification multiple times, rather than providing the nuanced historical perspective found in the original.\n- The ending of the completion lacks the original's closing commentary and instead repeats a justification about the young ladies' lack of blame, which is not how the original concludes."

          "text_segment": "Let us return to the “Examination.” The first composition that was read was one entitled “Is this, then, Life?” Perhaps the reader can endure an extract from it:\n“In the common walks of life, with what delightful emotions does the youthful mind look forward to some anticipated scene of festivity! Imagination is busy sketching rose-tinted pictures of joy. In fancy, the voluptuous votary of fashion sees herself amid the festive throng, ‘the observed of all observers.’ Her graceful form, arrayed in snowy robes, is whirling through the mazes of the joyous dance; her eye is brightest, her step is lightest in the gay assembly.\n“In such delicious fancies time quickly glides by, and the welcome hour arrives for her entrance into the Elysian world, of which she has had such bright dreams. How fairy-like does everything appear to her enchanted vision! Each new scene is more charming than the last. But after a while she finds that beneath this goodly exterior, all is vanity, the flattery which once charmed her soul, now grates harshly upon her ear; the ballroom has lost its charms; and with wasted health and imbittered heart, she turns away with the conviction that earthly pleasures cannot satisfy the longings of the soul!”\nAnd so forth and so on. There was a buzz of gratification from time to time during the reading, accompanied by whispered ejaculations of “How sweet!” “How eloquent!” “So true!” etc., and after the thing had closed with a peculiarly afflicting sermon the applause was enthusiastic.\nThen arose a slim, melancholy girl, whose face had the “interesting” paleness that comes of pills and indigestion, and read a “poem.” Two stanzas of it will do:\n“A MISSOURI MAIDEN’S FAREWELL TO ALABAMA\n“Alabama, goodbye! I love thee well!\n    But yet for a while do I leave thee now!\nSad, yes, sad thoughts of thee my heart doth swell,\n    And burning recollections throng my brow!\nFor I have wandered through thy flowery woods;\n    Have roamed and read near Tallapoosa’s stream;\nHave listened to Tallassee’s warring floods,\n    And wooed on Coosa’s side Aurora’s beam.\n\n“Yet shame I not to bear an o’erfull heart,\n    Nor blush to turn behind my tearful eyes;\n’Tis from no stranger land I now must part,\n    ’Tis to no strangers left I yield these sighs.\nWelcome and home were mine within this State,\n    Whose vales I leave—whose spires fade fast from me\nAnd cold must be mine eyes, and heart, and tête,\n    When, dear Alabama! they turn cold on thee!”\nThere were very few there who knew what “tête” meant, but the poem was very satisfactory, nevertheless.\nNext appeared a dark-complexioned, black-eyed, black-haired young lady, who paused an impressive moment, assumed a tragic expression, and began to read in a measured, solemn tone:\nDark and tempestuous was night. Around the throne on high not a single star quivered; but the deep intonations of the heavy thunder constantly vibrated upon the ear; whilst the terrific lightning revelled in angry mood through the cloudy chambers of heaven, seeming to scorn the power exerted over its terror by the illustrious Franklin! Even the boisterous winds unanimously came forth from their mystic homes, and blustered about as if to enhance by their aid the wildness of the scene.\nAt such a time, so dark, so dreary, for human sympathy my very spirit sighed; but instead thereof,\n ‘My dearest friend, my counsellor, my comforter and guide—\n        My joy in grief, my second bliss in joy,’ came to my side.\nShe moved like one of those bright beings pictured in the sunny walks of fancy’s Eden by the romantic and young, a queen of beauty unadorned save by her own transcendent loveliness. So soft was her step, it failed to make even a sound, and but for the magical thrill imparted by her genial touch, as other unobtrusive beauties, she would have glided away unperceived—unsought. A strange sadness rested upon her features, like icy tears upon the robe of December, as she pointed to the contending elements without, and bade me contemplate the two beings presented.\nThis nightmare occupied some ten pages of manuscript and wound up with a sermon so destructive of all hope to non-Presbyterians that it took the first prize. This composition was considered to be the very finest effort of the evening. The mayor of the village, in delivering the prize to the author of it, made a warm speech in which he said that it was by far the most “eloquent” thing he had ever listened to, and that Daniel Webster himself might well be proud of it.\nIt may be remarked, in passing, that the number of compositions in which the word “beauteous” was over-fondled, and human experience referred to as “life’s page,” was up to the usual average.",

              "simple_agent_extraction": "Let us return to the “Examination.” The first composition was on \"Is this, then, Life?\" The young lady who wrote it was eighteen, and her early hopes had been blighted. She elegantly pictured herself as entering upon life, a gay and thoughtless young creature, fluttering from flower to flower, and poisoning the sweetness of each with the sting of a heartless frivolity. But don’t you think it was mournful, she asked, when, by and by, she learned that the hollow world she had vainly trusted was but a fiend in disguise, and was turning an aching void where a happy heart had been? And don’t you think it was mournful, still, when she discovered, further, that this aching void was not a good place to sprout such little things as Christian graces in, but only a brambly wilderness of sinful desires, and blighting cares, and hopeless longings? Yes, she said, mournfully, it was mournful. And so she laid her aching heart on the altar of the Home, and lived it all away in tearful repinings, but still got no peace till she died. And then she went to a better land and got it. —All the mothers, and all the grandmothers, and all the aunts sighed, and said, “How sweet!” and “So true!” and wiped their eyes; and the young ladies tittered, and held their handkerchiefs to their mouths, and hid it with a blush, which was reasonable and proper; and the young gentlemen looked foolish and pained, and thought what an ass he was they didn’t know who, but he must be an ass—or he wouldn’t be so happy and satisfied when a noble soul was suffering so torridly. The soloist sang an air mournful enough to stir a “person’s bile,” as the schoolmaster afterward said, but was not sorrowful enough, for she preceded it with a minister who prayed for twenty minutes, and the audience all through the general exercises, till the choir struck up, were yawning, and nodding, and drooping. After the choir stopped, the minister prayed a little more. Before the close of the school, the pupils recited poetry, which they picked out themselves. Nobody cared a rap for the poetry, but they thought the declaimers pretty good. Some of the declamations were very good, indeed. When a slender, melancholy girl of sixteen got up to read a poem on “Woman,” she picked a peck of paper with a pin, and straightened her dress, and smoothed her hair, and fixed her shoe-strings, and got another peck with the pin, and then stood apparently drowned in thought, and waiting for the storm to pass so she could begin, then she began. When she got through, the house came down. They had never heard anything like it. The applause was fearful. When the schoolmaster rose, red in the face, to call up the next student, a brave boy sung out: “My! she’s a daisy!” The schoolmaster stepped to the edge of the platform, smote his desk with his ruler, and shouted: “Silence! Order!” and it was so. A dark-complexioned young lady with a slim figure and a romantic face got up and read a poem. A few lines will do: “A MISSOURI MAIDEN’S FAREWELL TO ALABAMA.” “Alabama, good-bye! I love thee well! But yet for a while do I leave thee now! Sad, sad thoughts my bosom swell, And big tears gather upon my brow! “The birds they sing, the flowers they bloom, And sweetly mournful the breezes sigh; And these bring back, with a sigh and gloom, My youth and its gayety gone for aye! “They give me to weep, and they give me to sigh, They give me my lost youth back again, With its sunny hours of feigned ecstasy; But mournfully sweet is the pleasuring pain!” There was a slight murmur of applause when she got through. The schoolmaster rose and said that this poem was a composition of great merit, and very finished and happy in its own way. The poem was by a young lady who had just come from Alabama, and was a little homesick, and so it was very natural that she should feel sad, and she did. She was a very sweet girl, and she was very much liked. She was going to write a poem on “The Mississippi River” next, and he hoped it would be as good as this one.

The next composition was a poem by a slim, melancholy girl, whose pallor suggested pills and digestive troubles. She read it in a voice so low and so mournful that it was hard to catch the words, but the audience seemed to understand it, and they applauded.

She got up and paused, and adopted a tragic demeanor, and began to read in a slow, serious voice. Her composition was about a dark, stormy night, and a yearning for human sympathy, and the arrival of a beautiful, comforting female figure. It was a long composition, about ten pages of manuscript, and it closed with a sermon which was so vehemently anti-non-Presbyterian that it took the first prize. It was considered the finest composition of the evening. The mayor of the village, in awarding the prize, made a speech in which he said that it was the most eloquent composition he had ever heard, and that he was sure that Daniel Webster himself would have admired it. The compositions were all in the usual strain, and the usual words were used with the usual frequency. “Beauteous” was a favorite word, and “life’s page” was a favorite phrase.",

But he made a sad business of it with his unsteady hand, and a smothered titter rippled over the house. He knew what the matter was, and set himself to right it. He sponged out lines and remade them; but he only distorted them more than ever, and the tittering was more pronounced. He threw his entire attention upon his work, now, as if determined not to be put down by the mirth. He felt that all eyes were fastened upon him; he imagined he was succeeding, and yet the tittering continued; it even manifestly increased. And well it might. There was a garret above, pierced with a scuttle over his head; and down through this scuttle came a cat, suspended around the haunches by a string; she had a rag tied about her head and jaws to keep her from mewing; as she slowly descended she curved upward and clawed at the string, she swung downward and clawed at the intangible air. The tittering rose higher and higher—the cat was within six inches of the absorbed teacher’s head—down, down, a little lower, and she grabbed his wig with her desperate claws, clung to it, and was snatched up into the garret in an instant with her trophy still in her possession! And how the light did blaze abroad from the master’s bald pate—for the signpainter’s boy had gilded it!\nThat broke up the meeting. The boys were avenged. Vacation had come.",

MAJOR STRUCTURAL ISSUES:\n- The completion introduces several invented events and scenes not present in the original, such as the use of a faulty T-square, the boys making jokes about the map, the master planning to wait until after school to address misconduct, and the master reacting with rage and chasing the boys. Additionally, the aftermath involving the signpainter's boy being carried in triumph and the master collapsing in despair are not part of the original passage.\n\n2. MISSING ELEMENTS:\n- The completion omits the specific details about the cat's descent, such as the method used to keep the cat quiet and the cat's actions as it neared the teacher. It also lacks the description of the audience's reaction escalating as the cat approaches. The unique visual detail about the master's head after losing his wig is missing, as is the concise resolution of the event and the clear statement about the boys' sense of victory and the start of vacation.\n\n3. INACCURATE ELEMENTS:\n- There are inaccuracies in the sequence of events: the completion has the master noticing the cat before the cat grabs his wig, whereas in the original, the master remains absorbed in his task until the cat acts. The completion also misattributes actions and reactions, such as the master's emotional response and the boys' behavior after the incident. The ending is extended with invented scenes and does not match the original's brief and direct conclusion."

Tom soon found himself tormented with a desire to drink and swear; the desire grew to be so intense that nothing but the hope of a chance to display himself in his red sash kept him from withdrawing from the order. Fourth of July was coming; but he soon gave that up—gave it up before he had worn his shackles over forty-eight hours—and fixed his hopes upon old Judge Frazer, justice of the peace, who was apparently on his deathbed and would have a big public funeral, since he was so high an official. During three days Tom was deeply concerned about the Judge’s condition and hungry for news of it. Sometimes his hopes ran high—so high that he would venture to get out his regalia and practise before the looking-glass. But the Judge had a most discouraging way of fluctuating. At last he was pronounced upon the mend—and then convalescent. Tom was disgusted; and felt a sense of injury, too. He handed in his resignation at once—and that night the Judge suffered a relapse and died. Tom resolved that he would never trust a man like that again.\nThe funeral was a fine thing. The Cadets paraded in a style calculated to kill the late member with envy. Tom was a free boy again, however—there was something in that. He could drink and swear, now—but found to his surprise that he did not want to. The simple fact that he could, took the desire away, and the charm of it.",

It was true he was free, free as the wind, but the wind, he discovered, sometimes just drifted aimlessly. There was no school bell to defy, no lessons to shirk, no master to outwit. The glorious liberty he had yearned for seemed, in its boundless reality, a trifle dull. He loafed about the house, kicked listlessly at pebbles in the dust, and watched the flies buzz on the windowpanes. He tried fishing, but the fish weren't biting, or perhaps his heart wasn't in it without the thrill of sneaking off to the river when he ought to be elsewhere. He attempted to organize a game of pirates with Joe Harper, but Joe was visiting his aunt in the country. Sid was, of course, no companion for adventure, being far too proper and obedient. Mary was busy with her chores. The world, which had seemed so full of forbidden delights just days ago, now felt strangely empty of purpose. He missed the structure, the very rules he had so despised, because breaking them had been the sport. Now, with no rules to break, there was no sport. He wandered down to the riverbank, skipped a few stones, and sighed. The long, sun-drenched hours stretched ahead, promising nothing but more idleness. He needed something to happen, something exciting, something that would make his heart thump and his blood race. The quiet peace of vacation was, he realized with a start, almost unbearable. He longed for a challenge, a mystery, a bit of mischief – anything to break the monotony of perfect freedom. The world needed stirring up, and Tom felt just the boy to do it, if only he could find the right opportunity."

Tom stood a moment white with despair, and then sighed and said: \"All right, Huck, it ain't any matter.\" He turned away and went home, feeling that he was the only lost soul in the village, and that everybody else was saved.

For weeks, he lay in bed, feverish and weak, the world outside a hazy, distant dream. While he languished, a wave of religious fervor washed over St. Petersburg. A powerful revivalist preacher arrived, stirring souls and converting sinners by the score. The entire town seemed to turn pious overnight. When Tom finally recovered, pale and shaky, he emerged into a transformed world. His friends, once eager companions in mischief, now spoke of grace and salvation. Even Huck Finn, usually impervious to such matters, showed signs of being affected. Tom felt utterly alone, a solitary sinner in a sea of saints. The joy of recovery was overshadowed by a profound sense of isolation and gloom. He found no solace in the newfound piety of others, only a bitter reminder of his own perceived wickedness and the heavy weight of his secret."

He cowered in the dark under the bedclothes and waited in a horror of suspense. He was sure it was all about himself. He had strained the mercy of God till it was threadbare and worn out, and now He must work His will. He thought it was awful, that so big a commotion should be made about such a little thing as himself—but he got no comfort out of the thought. He felt so insignificant and so guilty that he almost expected to see a little blue flame flicker and go out when the next flash came. He was sure he had strained the patience of the powers above to the breaking point, and that this was the consequence. While it might seem an excessive use of resources to annihilate a tiny creature with heavy artillery, Tom saw nothing illogical about such an elaborate thunderstorm being orchestrated to eradicate an insignificant being like himself.",

MAJOR STRUCTURAL ISSUES:\n- The completion introduces a lengthy, repetitive sequence of self-promises to be good, which is not present in the original passage. This invented section significantly alters the structure and focus of the narrative.\n- The completion adds invented details such as the character stuffing his ears with cotton, thinking the wind will tear the roof off, and recalling a list of his sins, none of which are present in the original.\n- The ending of the completion shifts to a resolution and self-reassurance that is not part of the original passage's conclusion.\n\n2. MISSING ELEMENTS:\n- The completion omits the original's reflection on the perceived disproportion between the character's actions and the scale of the storm, as well as the metaphor comparing the storm to artillery used against a small creature.\n- The original's specific reasoning about the cause of the storm and the character's sense of personal significance in the event is not fully captured.\n\n3. INACCURATE ELEMENTS:\n- The sequence of events is altered: the completion introduces new actions and thoughts that do not align with the original order, such as the character's detailed self-examination and the extended internal monologue about being good.\n- The completion attributes actions and feelings to the character that are not present in the original, such as being gratified by the number of his sins and feeling sick with terror in a way that is not described in the source.\n- The completion inaccurately presents the aftermath of the storm, suggesting a sense of relief and a promise to change, which is not the focus or tone of the original ending."

It keeps me in a sweat, constant, so’s I want to hide som’ers.”\n“That’s just the same way they go on round me. I reckon he’s a goner. Don’t you feel sorry for him, sometimes?”\n“Most always—most always. He ain’t no account; but then he hain’t ever done anything to hurt anybody. Just fishes a little, to get money to get drunk on—and loafs around considerable; but lord, we all do that—leastways most of us—preachers and such like. But he’s kind of good—he give me half a fish, once, when there warn’t enough for two; and lots of times he’s kind of stood by me when I was out of luck.”\n“Well, he’s mended kites for me, Huck, and knitted hooks on to my line. I wish we could get him out of there.”\n“My! we couldn’t get him out, Tom. And besides, ’twouldn’t do any good; they’d ketch him again.”\n“Yes—so they would. But I hate to hear ’em abuse him so like the dickens when he never done—that.”\n“I do too, Tom. Lord, I hear ’em say he’s the bloodiest looking villain in this country, and they wonder he wasn’t ever hung before.”\n“Yes, they talk like that, all the time. I’ve heard ’em say that if he was to get free they’d lynch him.”\n“And they’d do it, too.”\nThe boys had a long talk, but it brought them little comfort. As the twilight drew on, they found themselves hanging about the neighborhood of the little isolated jail, perhaps with an undefined hope that something would happen that might clear away their difficulties. But nothing happened; there seemed to be no angels or fairies interested in this luckless captive.\nThe boys did as they had often done before—went to the cell grating and gave Potter some tobacco and matches. He was on the ground floor and there were no guards.\nHis gratitude for their gifts had always smote their consciences before—it cut deeper than ever, this time. They felt cowardly and treacherous to the last degree when Potter said:\n“You’ve been mighty good to me, boys—better’n anybody else in this town. And I don’t forget it, I don’t. Often I says to myself, says I, ‘I used to mend all the boys’ kites and things, and show ’em where the good fishin’ places was, and befriend ’em what I could, and now they’ve all forgot old Muff when he’s in trouble; but Tom don’t, and Huck don’t—they don’t forget him,’ says I, ‘and I don’t forget them.’ Well, boys, I done an awful thing—drunk and crazy at the time—that’s the only way I account for it—and now I got to swing for it, and it’s right. Right, and best, too, I reckon—hope so, anyway. Well, we won’t talk about that. I don’t want to make you feel bad; you’ve befriended me. But what I want to say, is, don’t you ever get drunk—then you won’t ever get here. Stand a litter furder west—so—that’s it; it’s a prime comfort to see faces that’s friendly when a body’s in such a muck of trouble, and there don’t none come here but yourn. Good friendly faces—good friendly faces. Git up on one another’s backs and let me touch ’em. That’s it. Shake hands—yourn’ll come through the bars, but mine’s too big. Little hands, and weak—but they’ve helped Muff Potter a power, and they’d help him more if they could.”",

We can’t tell.”\n“No, we can’t tell. But maybe we can do something else.”\nThey sat in silence for a long time, thinking. The twilight deepened, and the stars came out. They were sitting on the river bank, near the jail. The jail was a small stone building, with a few windows high up. There was a light in one of the windows.\n“Huck, let’s go and look at him.”\n“No, Tom, I’m afraid.”\n“Don’t be afraid, Huck. We won’t go in. We’ll just look through the window.”\nThey got up and crept towards the jail. They went to the window where the light was. It was a grated window, and they could see into the cell. Muff Potter was sitting on the floor, with his head in his hands. He looked very sad.\n“Poor old chap,” said Tom, in a whisper.\n“Yes, he does look awful bad,” said Huck.\nThey stood there for a long time, looking at him. They felt very sorry for him. At last, Tom said:\n“Huck, let’s give him some tobacco.”\n“All right,” said Huck.\nThey had a plug of tobacco between them. They broke off a piece and pushed it through the grating. Muff Potter looked up. He saw them, and his face brightened a little.\n“Hello, boys,” he said.\n“Hello, Mr. Potter,” they said.\n“Thank ye, boys, thank ye. Ye’re the only friends I got in the world. I won’t forget ye for this.”\nHe took the tobacco and put it in his mouth. He chewed it for a while, and then he said:\n“Boys, I’m in an awful peck of trouble. I don’t know what’s going to become of me.”\n“We’re awful sorry for you, Mr. Potter,” said Tom.\n“Yes, we are,” said Huck.\n“Thank ye, boys, thank ye. It’s a comfort to me to hear ye say that. I ain’t got no hope, though. I’m a goner, I reckon.”\nHe sighed and put his head in his hands again. The boys stood there for a while longer, and then they crept away. They went back to the river bank and sat down again.\n“Tom, it’s awful,” said Huck.\n“Yes, it is,” said Tom.\nThey sat there for a long time, thinking. They didn’t say anything more. At last, they got up and went home. They couldn’t sleep that night. They lay awake, thinking about Muff Potter and the murder. They wished they had never seen that money. They wished they had never been in the graveyard that night. They wished they were dead.\n\nCHAPTER XXIV",

They studiously avoided each other. Each wandered away, from time to time, but the same dismal fascination always brought them back presently. Tom kept his ears open when idlers sauntered out of the courtroom, but invariably heard distressing news—the toils were closing more and more relentlessly around poor Potter. At the end of the second day the village talk was to the effect that Injun Joe’s evidence stood firm and unshaken, and that there was not the slightest question as to what the jury’s verdict would be.\nTom was out late, that night, and came to bed through the window. He was in a tremendous state of excitement. It was hours before he got to sleep. All the village flocked to the courthouse the next morning, for this was to be the great day. Both sexes were about equally represented in the packed audience. After a long wait the jury filed in and took their places; shortly afterward, Potter, pale and haggard, timid and hopeless, was brought in, with chains upon him, and seated where all the curious eyes could stare at him; no less conspicuous was Injun Joe, stolid as ever. There was another pause, and then the judge arrived and the sheriff proclaimed the opening of the court. The usual whisperings among the lawyers and gathering together of papers followed.

It was said that when some sympathizing souls tried to raise a doubt about it in a dispute with the prosecutor, they were put down magnificently with arguments which showed that the mere fact that he stood mute, and was not trying to escape, was simply additional proof of guilt, for why shouldn't he proclaim his innocence if he were innocent?—and why shouldn't he fly if he were guilty?

                "refinement_prompt": "IMPROVEMENT GUIDANCE:\n1. MAJOR STRUCTURAL ISSUES:\n- The completion introduces several invented scenes and reflections, especially in the early and middle sections. These include extended internal struggles, invented conversations about conscience, and fabricated details about the passage of days and the boys' intentions to reveal the truth. There is also an invented sequence involving the trial's progression, such as the calling of witnesses and the defense's case, which are not present in the original excerpt.\n\n2. MISSING ELEMENTS:\n- The completion omits the original's focus on the boys' avoidance of each other and their repeated returns to the courthouse area, as well as the specific behavior of Tom listening to people leaving the courtroom. It also lacks the detailed description of the courtroom atmosphere, including the arrival of the judge, the sheriff's proclamation, and the specific actions that build suspense before the trial begins.\n- The completion does not include the original's emphasis on the relentless tightening of the case against Potter and the unshaken nature of Injun Joe's testimony.\n\n3. INACCURATE ELEMENTS:\n- The completion provides inaccurate timing and sequence of events, such as referencing days of the week and the start of the trial, which do not align with the original passage's timeline.\n- It misattributes actions and perspectives, such as the boys' supposed presence in the courtroom and their emotional states during the trial, which are not depicted in the original excerpt.\n- The completion invents public reactions and legal arguments that are not present in the original, and it introduces characters and actions (like the defense lawyer calling Tom as a witness) that occur later in the book, not in this passage."

Why, Tom, it’ll take us a year!”“Well, then, we’ll start right in after dinner.”“But, Tom, we don’t know where to begin—what tree to start with.”“Never mind, it don’t matter where we begin—all we got to do is to hunt till we find it. We can begin right here, on the hill.”“All right. It’s all the same to me. Let’s get something to dig with. We can go up to the widow’s and git a pickaxe and a shovel. She won’t care.”“Oh, I reckon not. They’re mighty particular about that sort of things, they are. She’d raise Cain.”“Then what are we going to do?”“Well, I don’t know. We can’t do anything till we get some tools. Maybe we can borrow some of the nigger.”“That’s it! We can borrow Uncle Jake’s pick and shovel. He won’t care. He’s always willing to lend anything.”“All right. We’ll go and get them.”They went to the negro quarters and borrowed the tools. Uncle Jake was willing enough; he was used to lending them. He was a good-natured, simple old fellow, and he liked the boys. They went back to the hill and began to dig. They dug and dug, but they found nothing. They dug till they were tired, and then they rested. They talked about the treasure, and how they would spend it when they found it. They would buy a boat, and go down the river",

But I bet you I ain’t going to throw off on di’monds. Some of ’em’s worth twenty dollars apiece—there ain’t any, hardly, but’s worth six bits or a dollar.”\n“No! Is that so?”\n“Cert’nly—anybody’ll tell you so. Hain’t you ever seen one, Huck?”\n“Not as I remember.”\n“Oh, kings have slathers of them.”\n“Well, I don’ know no kings, Tom.”\n“I reckon you don’t. But if you was to go to Europe you’d see a raft of ’em hopping around.”\n“Do they hop?”\n“Hop?—your granny! No!”\n“Well, what did you say they did, for?”\n“Shucks, I only meant you’d see ’em—not hopping, of course—what do they want to hop for?—but I mean you’d just see ’em—scattered around, you know, in a kind of a general way. Like that old humpbacked Richard.”\n“Richard? What’s his other name?”\n“He didn’t have any other name.

But say—where you going to dig first?”\n“Well, I don’t know. S’pose we tackle that old dead-limb tree on the hill t’other side of Still-House branch?”\n“I’m agreed.”\nSo they got a crippled pick and a shovel, and set out on their three-mile tramp.

I bet I’ll have a gay time.”\n“Well, ain’t you going to save any of it?”\n“Save it? What for?”\n“Why, so as to have something to live on, by and by.”\n“Oh, that ain’t any use. Pap would come back to thish-yer town some day and get his claws on it if I didn’t hurry up, and I tell you he’d clean it out pretty quick. What you going to do with yourn, Tom?”\n“I’m going to buy a new drum, and a sure’nough sword, and a red necktie and a bull pup, and get married.”\n“Married!”\n“That’s it.”\n“Tom, you—why, you ain’t in your right mind.”\n“Wait—you’ll see.”\n“Well, that’s the foolishest thing you could do. Look at pap and my mother. Fight! Why, they used to fight all the time. I remember, mighty well.”\n“That ain’t anything. The girl I’m going to marry won’t fight.”\n“Tom, I reckon they’re all alike. They’ll all comb a body. Now you better think ’bout this awhile. I tell you you better. What’s the name of the gal?”\n“It ain’t a gal at all—it’s a girl.”\n“It’s all the same, I reckon; some says gal, some says girl—both’s right, like enough. Anyway, what’s her name, Tom?”\n“I’ll tell you some time—not now.”\n“All right—that’ll do. Only if you get married I’ll be more lonesomer than ever.”\n“No you won’t. You’ll come and live with me. Now stir out of this and we’ll go to digging.”\n",

Spirits whispered in the rustling leaves, ghosts lurked in the murky nooks, the deep baying of a hound floated up out of the distance, an owl answered with his sepulchral note. The boys were subdued by these solemnities, and talked little. By and by they judged that twelve had come; they marked where the shadow fell, and began to dig. Their hopes commenced to rise. Their interest grew stronger, and their industry kept pace with it.

We can’t ever tell the right time, and besides this kind of thing’s too awful, here this time of night with witches and ghosts a-fluttering around so.

I’ve always heard that.”\n“Tom, I don’t like to fool around much where there’s dead people. A body’s bound to get into trouble with ’em, sure.”\n“I don’t like to stir ’em up, either.

The moon was struggling through ragged clouds, casting shifting, ghostly shadows among the leaning headstones and sunken graves. A chill wind sighed through the ancient oaks, making the dry leaves rustle like whispering secrets. Tom and Huck huddled behind a large clump of bushes near the edge of the woods, their hearts thumping against their ribs like trapped birds. Every snap of a twig, every distant hoot of an owl, sent a fresh wave of terror through them. They spoke in hushed whispers, if they spoke at all, mostly just gripping each other's arms in silent dread. They had brought a dead cat, as per the superstition, believing it could cure warts if buried at midnight in a graveyard where a wicked person was buried. But the warts were forgotten now, swallowed by the overwhelming fear of the place and the hour. Presently, they heard footsteps approaching. Three figures emerged from the gloom, carrying shovels and a pickaxe. Tom and Huck recognized them instantly, even in the poor light: Injun Joe, the half-breed; Muff Potter, the town drunkard; and young Dr. Robinson. The doctor seemed uneasy, while the other two looked grimly determined. They stopped near a fresh grave, one that had been dug only a few days prior. It was the grave of Hoss Williams. Injun Joe pointed to it, and the three men began their ghastly work. The scraping sound of the shovels biting into the earth was sickeningly loud in the stillness of the night. Tom and Huck watched, paralyzed by a mixture of horror and morbid fascination. They saw the dirt fly, heard the grunts of effort, and knew they were witnessing something terrible, something they should not be seeing. The air grew colder, and the shadows seemed to deepen around the working men. The boys dared not move, scarcely dared to breathe, lest they give away their presence. They were trapped witnesses to a sacrilege, and the night was only just beginning its dark revelations."

It stands to reason. Becuz you know that they don’t anybody but ghosts use ’em.”\n“Yes, that’s so.

Tom was impatient to go to the haunted house; Huck was measurably so, also—but suddenly said:\n“Lookyhere, Tom, do you know what day it is?”\nTom mentally ran over the days of the week, and then quickly lifted his eyes with a startled look in them—\n“My! I never once thought of it, Huck!”\n“Well, I didn’t neither, but all at once it popped onto me that it was Friday.”\n“Blame it, a body can’t be too careful, Huck. We might ’a’ got into an awful scrape, tackling such a thing on a Friday.”\n“Might! Better say we would! There’s some lucky days, maybe, but Friday ain’t.”\n“Any fool knows that. I don’t reckon you was the first that found it out, Huck.”\n“Well, I never said I was, did I? And Friday ain’t all, neither. I had a rotten bad dream last night—dreampt about rats.”\n“No! Sure sign of trouble. Did they fight?”\n“No.”\n“Well, that’s good, Huck. When they don’t fight it’s only a sign that there’s trouble around, you know. All we got to do is to look mighty sharp and keep out of it. We’ll drop this thing for today, and play. Do you know Robin Hood, Huck?”\n“No. Who’s Robin Hood?”\n“Why, he was one of the greatest men that was ever in England—and the best. He was a robber.”\n“Cracky, I wisht I was. Who did he rob?”\n“Only sheriffs and bishops and rich people and kings, and such like. But he never bothered the poor. He loved ’em. He always divided up with ’em perfectly square.”\n“Well, he must ’a’ been a brick.”\n“I bet you he was, Huck. Oh, he was the noblest man that ever was. They ain’t any such men now, I can tell you. He could lick any man in England, with one hand tied behind him; and he could take his yew bow and plug a ten-cent piece every time, a mile and a half.”\n“What’s a yew bow?”\n“I don’t know. It’s some kind of a bow, of course. And if he hit that dime only on the edge he would set down and cry—and curse. But we’ll play Robin Hood—it’s nobby fun. I’ll learn you.”\n“I’m agreed.”\nSo they played Robin Hood all the afternoon, now and then casting a yearning eye down upon the haunted house and passing a remark about the morrow’s prospects and possibilities there. As the sun began to sink into the west they took their way homeward athwart the long shadows of the trees and soon were buried from sight in the forests of Cardiff Hill.",

It’s dreadful bad luck. Ain’t you afeard?”\n“I don’t know. I don’t wish we’d come here, to tell you the truth. But what can we do? We ain’t got any other place.”\n“Well, that’s so. I hadn’t thought of that. I reckon we got to stand it. We can’t go home and leave the tools. Besides, they’d be expecting us. Oh, Gosh! And we ain’t got a bite to eat!”\n“That’s so.

I wish I hadn’t had that dream last night.”\n“Dream? What did you dream about?”\n“Well, I had such a bad dream about rats. I dreamt the house was full of rats, and they was all around me, and they was all fighting and squealing, and I couldn’t get away from them. And then I woke up, and I was so scared I couldn’t go to sleep again.”\n“Rats? That’s bad luck, sure. What kind of rats?”\n“Well, they was big rats, and little rats, and all kinds of rats. And they was all fighting and squealing, and I couldn’t get away from them.”\n“Did they bite you?”\n“No, they didn’t bite me. But they was all around me, and they was all fighting and squealing, and I couldn’t get away from them.”\n“That’s bad luck, sure. Rats fighting and squealing, and you can’t get away from them. That means trouble. I reckon we better not go to the haunted house to-day. We can go to-morrow.”\n“That’s what I think. We better not go to-day. We can go to-morrow. But what are we going to do to-day?”\n“Well, we can play Robin Hood.”\n“Robin Hood! That’s the best game there is. I like Robin Hood. He was a great man. He robbed the rich and gave to the poor. He was a friend of the poor.”\n“That’s so. He was a great man. And he was a great fighter, too. He could fight with a sword, and he could shoot with a bow and arrow. He was the best archer in the world.”\n“Did he have a yew bow?”\n“I don’t know. I reckon he did. But it don’t make no difference. We can play Robin Hood anyway.”\nSo they played Robin Hood all the afternoon, and they had a good time. But they kept looking towards the haunted house, and they wished it was to-morrow.",

They had a smoke and a chat in the shade, and then dug a little in their last hole, not with great hope, but merely because Tom said there were so many cases where people had given up a treasure after getting down within six inches of it, and then somebody else had come along and turned it up with a single thrust of a shovel. The thing failed this time, however, so the boys shouldered their tools and went away feeling that they had not trifled with fortune, but had fulfilled all the requirements that belong to the business of treasure-hunting.\nWhen they reached the haunted house there was something so weird and grisly about the dead silence that reigned there under the baking sun, and something so depressing about the loneliness and desolation of the place, that they were afraid, for a moment, to venture in. Then they crept to the door and took a trembling peep. They saw a weedgrown, floorless room, unplastered, an ancient fireplace, vacant windows, a ruinous staircase; and here, there, and everywhere hung ragged and abandoned cobwebs. They presently entered, softly, with quickened pulses, talking in whispers, ears alert to catch the slightest sound, and muscles tense and ready for instant retreat.\nIn a little while familiarity modified their fears and they gave the place a critical and interested examination, rather admiring their own boldness, and wondering at it, too. Next they wanted to look upstairs. This was something like cutting off retreat, but they got to daring each other, and of course there could be but one result—they threw their tools into a corner and made the ascent. Up there were the same signs of decay. In one corner they found a closet that promised mystery, but the promise was a fraud—there was nothing in it. Their courage was up now and well in hand. They were about to go down and begin work when—",

The sun was hot. The boys were tired, and they sat down in the shade to rest and smoke. “Huck,” said Tom, “do you really believe there’s treasure buried around here?” “Course I do. Everybody knows there’s treasure buried around here. I know a man that found a pot of money in a cellar, and he said it was buried by pirates. And I know another man that found a pot of money in a field, and he said it was buried by Indians.” “Yes, but how do you know it’s buried around here?” “Well, I don’t know for sure, but it stands to reason. This is a good place for it. It’s out of the way, and it’s easy to find again.” “Yes, that’s true. But how do you know it’s under this tree?” “Well, I don’t know for sure, but it’s as likely here as anywhere else. And besides, we’ve already dug here a little.” “Yes, that’s true. But we haven’t found anything yet.” “No, but we will. We just have to keep digging.” They dug for another hour, but they found nothing. They were discouraged. “Well,” said Tom, “I guess there ain’t no treasure here.” “I guess not,” said Huck. “Let’s go somewhere else.” “Where do you want to go?” “I don’t know. How about the haunted house?” “The haunted house! Are you crazy? Nobody goes near the haunted house.” “Well, I ain’t afraid. Are you?” “No, I ain’t afraid. But it’s dangerous.” “Aw, come on. It’ll be fun.” “All right. Let’s go.” They put their tools away and started for the haunted house. It was a mile away, and the sun was hot. They walked along in silence for a while. “Say, Huck,” said Tom, “do you think anybody ever lived in that house?” “I don’t know. Maybe. But they ain’t there now.” “No, I guess not. It’s been empty for years.” They came to the house. It stood on a hill, and it looked lonely and desolate. The windows were broken, and the paint was peeling. The door was open, and it sagged on its hinges. The boys stood for a moment, looking at it. “Well,” said Tom, “are you going in?” “I don’t know,” said Huck. “Are you?” “Yes, I am. Are you coming?” “I guess so.” They walked slowly towards the house. The grass was long and tangled, and there were weeds everywhere. They came to the door and peered inside. The room was empty and bare. The floor was gone in places, and the walls were crumbling. There was a fireplace, but it was filled with rubbish. The windows were empty frames. There was a staircase leading up, but it looked rickety and unsafe. Cobwebs hung everywhere.

No—coming.... Here they are. Don’t whisper another word, Huck. My goodness, I wish I was out of this!”\nTwo men entered. Each boy said to himself: “There’s the old deaf and dumb Spaniard that’s been about town once or twice lately—never saw t’other man before.”\n“T’other” was a ragged, unkempt creature, with nothing very pleasant in his face. The Spaniard was wrapped in a serape; he had bushy white whiskers; long white hair flowed from under his sombrero, and he wore green goggles.

His manner became less guarded and his words more distinct as he proceeded:\n“No,” said he, “I’ve thought it all over, and I don’t like it. It’s dangerous.”\n“Dangerous!” grunted the “deaf and dumb” Spaniard—to the vast surprise of the boys. “Milksop!”\nThis voice made the boys gasp and quake. It was Injun Joe’s! There was silence for some time. Then Joe said:\n“What’s any more dangerous than that job up yonder—but nothing’s come of it.”\n“That’s different. Away up the river so, and not another house about. ’Twon’t ever be known that we tried, anyway, long as we didn’t succeed.”\n“Well, what’s more dangerous than coming here in the daytime!—anybody would suspicion us that saw us.”\n“I know that. But there warn’t any other place as handy after that fool of a job. I want to quit this shanty. I wanted to yesterday, only it warn’t any use trying to stir out of here, with those infernal boys playing over there on the hill right in full view.”\n“Those infernal boys” quaked again under the inspiration of this remark, and thought how lucky it was that they had remembered it was Friday and concluded to wait a day.

MAJOR STRUCTURAL ISSUES:\n- The completion introduces a lengthy invented dialogue between the two men that is not present in the original, including discussions about honesty, England, and America. This fabricated exchange replaces the original, more concise conversation and alters the tone and focus of the scene.\n- The completion omits the original's clear transition from the men's conversation to their agreement and subsequent actions, instead inserting additional invented dialogue and reflections.\n\n2. MISSING ELEMENTS:\n- The completion lacks the original's specific instructions given by one character to the other regarding where to wait and the plan for their next meeting.\n- The sense of a \"long and thoughtful silence\" before the key dialogue is not fully conveyed.\n- The completion does not include the original's explicit mention of both men yawning and the mutual agreement that one will watch while the other sleeps.\n- The original's description of the boys' emotional state as they wait in hiding, including their sense of time dragging and their relief at the day's end, is only partially represented and lacks the original's depth.\n\n3. INACCURATE ELEMENTS:\n- The completion presents an inaccurate sequence of dialogue, with invented lines and responses that do not match the original exchange.\n- The timing and order of events are altered: the transition from conversation to sleep and then to the boys' attempted escape is not as clearly delineated as in the original.\n- The completion attributes additional motivations and reflections to the characters that are not present in the source material, such as discussions about wealth, safety, and destinations beyond what is actually mentioned.\n- The ending compresses the boys' experience of waiting and their emotional response, omitting the original's more nuanced depiction of their relief at sunset."

They were so absorbed in watching the men that they didn't notice that the men were coming right toward them. The men reached the door and stopped. “Hold on,” said Injun Joe. “I forgot somethin'. I'll be right back.” He went back to the hole and began to dig again. The comrade stood in the doorway, waiting. Injun Joe dug for a few minutes, then he stopped and listened. He dug again, then stopped and listened again. He dug again, and this time his knife struck something hard. “Hello!” he said. “What's this?” He dug around it and found it was a box. He worked at it with his knife until he had pried off the lid. He reached in and pulled out a handful of coins. “Gold!” he whispered. “By God, it's gold!” The comrade came running back. “What is it?” he asked. “Gold!” said Injun Joe. “A box of gold! Look!” He held out his hand, and the comrade looked. “By God!” he said. “It is gold!” They both looked into the box. It was full of gold coins. “We're rich!” said Injun Joe. “We're rich!” The boys in the loft were just as excited as the men below. They had forgotten all about their fear. They were only thinking about the gold. They had never seen so much money in their lives. They couldn't believe their eyes. They were so thrilled they could hardly keep from shouting.",

These niggers are gittin' too thick around here for my comfort, now. I haven't saw a white man all day, hardly.” He roused his comrade with his foot, and said, “Git up! You've slept sound. What on airth you thinkin' about? Don't you know it's most sun-up? Don't you know it's dangerous to be loafin' around these parts after sun-up? Come! Git up!” “All right,” said the comrade, rubbing his eyes. “I'm up. What's the trouble? I hain't heard nothin'.” “Well, you didn't any more than half listen, then. I hain't heard nothin' myself, but I feel it in my bones that we're gittin' too much company. Up with you and let's git!—Quick!” “All right, Joe. I'm on my feet. Don't hurry me. What are we goin' to do with the swag?” “I fetched it along,” said Injun Joe, pointing to a sack. “She's all here. Six hundred and fifty in silver. I packed it in the flour-sacks.” “Well, let's git it away from here, then. It's risky to keep it here.” “No, it ain't risky, not in the dark. We'll bury it here, and come back for it some time or other. We can't take it with us, not very well. It's too heavy.” “All right. Where'll we bury it?” “Right here, I reckon. It's a good place. Nobody'll ever think of lookin' here.” He stooped down and began to dig with his bowie-knife. The comrade helped with his hands.

The doctor demanded the money they had agreed upon, but Injun Joe, his eyes glinting with malice, refused, reminding the doctor of a past insult, a time years ago when the doctor's father had driven him from his door and refused him food.

Injun Joe took the pick, looked it over critically, shook his head, muttered something to himself, and then began to use it. The box was soon unearthed. It was not very large; it was iron bound and had been very strong before the slow years had injured it. The men contemplated the treasure awhile in blissful silence.\n“Pard, there’s thousands of dollars here,” said Injun Joe.\n“’Twas always said that Murrel’s gang used to be around here one summer,” the stranger observed.\n“I know it,” said Injun Joe; “and this looks like it, I should say.”\n“Now you won’t need to do that job.”\nThe halfbreed frowned. Said he:\n“You don’t know me. Least you don’t know all about that thing. ’Tain’t robbery altogether—it’s revenge!” and a wicked light flamed in his eyes. “I’ll need your help in it. When it’s finished—then Texas. Go home to your Nance and your kids, and stand by till you hear from me.”\n“Well—if you say so; what’ll we do with this—bury it again?”\n“Yes. [Ravishing delight overhead.] No! by the great Sachem, no! [Profound distress overhead.] I’d nearly forgot. That pick had fresh earth on it! [The boys were sick with terror in a moment.] What business has a pick and a shovel here? What business with fresh earth on them? Who brought them here—and where are they gone? Have you heard anybody?—seen anybody? What! bury it again and leave them to come and see the ground disturbed? Not exactly—not exactly. We’ll take it to my den.”\n“Why, of course!

The box was soon unearthed. It was an old iron-bound sea-chest. He got the shovel ready to scoop out the dirt, but it was not needed. He simply pulled the chest out. He broke the stout lid open with the pickaxe. There was treasure!—enough to stir the dead! Ingots of gold and silver, coins of various countries—all tumbled pellmell together. It was coined money, but of ancient date. The men gazed in silence, now and then nodding their heads with satisfaction. They hardly needed to count. There was something like twelve thousand dollars in gold and silver coin and bars, right there in the chest.\n“Hark!” said the comrade. “Did you hear anything?”\nThey listened intently. No; the silence was profound. They resumed their great work. The comrade said:\n“I wish we’d had the boys’ tools. These are awkward to work with.

Injun Joe, you ain’t a-going to undertake that now, are you? Why, we’re rich!”\n“Rich! Yes, but I ain’t done yet. I’ve got a score to settle.

We don’t want to get caught.”\n“Caught! Who’s going to catch us? We’re safe enough. We’ve got the gold. We’ll be in Texas before anybody knows we’re gone.”\n“But what about that other job? You ain’t going to do that now, are you?”\n“Yes, I am! I’m going to do it now! I’ve got to do it! I can’t rest till it’s done. I’ve got to have my revenge.”\n“But why? Why do you want revenge?

He was nervous and suspicious, his eyes darting this way and that, scanning the deserted landscape for any sign of intrusion or observation. The silence of the old house pressed in on him, broken only by the creaks and groans of the timbers and the occasional rustle of leaves outside. He seemed to be listening intently, his head cocked, as if expecting to hear footsteps or voices. The afternoon sun slanted through the dusty panes, illuminating the motes dancing in the air and casting long, distorted shadows across the floor. He muttered to himself occasionally, low and guttural, words that were indistinguishable but conveyed a sense of unease and impatience. He checked the doors, testing the latches, ensuring they were secure. His movements were quick and furtive, like a trapped animal. The treasure, hidden somewhere within these walls, was the focus of his intense concentration, but the fear of discovery gnawed at him. He returned to the center of the room, his gaze sweeping over the floorboards, the walls, the ceiling, searching for the hidden mark he knew was there. The air felt thick with anticipation and the musty smell of decay. He was a man on edge, driven by greed and haunted by the possibility of being caught. The stillness of the house amplified his own internal turmoil, making every shadow seem like a lurking threat and every sound a potential warning. He paused, holding his breath, straining his ears, before resuming his restless pacing and watchful surveillance of the empty world outside."

Now you get hold of all the doorkeys you can find, and I’ll nip all of auntie’s, and the first dark night we’ll go there and try ’em.

Why, he might ’a’ found out he couldn’t get his revenge, and be going right after that money.”\n“It’s so, Tom, it’s so. I’ll foller him; I will, by jingoes!”\n“Now you’re talking!

                "refinement_prompt": "IMPROVEMENT GUIDANCE:\n1. MAJOR STRUCTURAL ISSUES:\n- The completion invents a lengthy sequence of events that do not occur in the original, including an extended treasure-digging scene, a visit to a haunted house, an encounter with two men digging up gold, and the boys ultimately finding and taking the treasure. None of these events are present in the original passage.\n- The completion adds dialogue and character reflections that are not part of the original excerpt.\n\n2. MISSING ELEMENTS:\n- The completion omits the specific details about Tom's preparations, such as where he hides the lantern and the use of a towel for concealment.\n- The original's focus on the boys' watchful waiting, the closing of the tavern, and the environmental details (such as the darkness and thunder) are not fully represented or are replaced with invented scenes.\n- The sense of anticipation and the lack of action (no one entering or leaving, no Spaniard appearing) is missing from the completion.\n\n3. INACCURATE ELEMENTS:\n- The completion provides an inaccurate sequence of events, with the boys engaging in activities (digging, following men, finding treasure) that do not occur in the original passage.\n- The timing and setting are altered, with invented actions taking place instead of the original's focus on waiting and observation.\n- The completion attributes actions and dialogue to the characters that are not present in the original, and introduces new characters and outcomes not found in the source passage."

Surely he must have fainted; maybe he was dead; maybe his heart had burst under terror and excitement.

There was not much to take away, for he seemed only able to inhale it by thimblefuls, and his heart would soon wear itself out, the way it was beating.

I’ll watch the whole night long, and I’ll do it every night, too, if you’ll do the other part of the job.”\n“All right, I will. All you got to do is to trot up Hooper Street a block and maow—and if I’m asleep, you throw some gravel at the window and that’ll fetch me.”\n“Agreed, and good as wheat!”\n“Now, Huck, the storm’s over, and I’ll go home. It’ll begin to be daylight in a couple of hours. You go back and watch that long, will you?”\n“I said I would, Tom, and I will. I’ll ha’nt that tavern every night for a year! I’ll sleep all day and I’ll stand watch all night.”\n“That’s all right. Now, where you going to sleep?”\n“In Ben Rogers’ hayloft. He lets me, and so does his pap’s nigger man, Uncle Jake. I tote water for Uncle Jake whenever he wants me to, and any time I ask him he gives me a little something to eat if he can spare it. That’s a mighty good nigger, Tom. He likes me, becuz I don’t ever act as if I was above him. Sometime I’ve set right down and eat with him. But you needn’t tell that. A body’s got to do things when he’s awful hungry he wouldn’t want to do as a steady thing.”\n“Well, if I don’t want you in the daytime, I’ll let you sleep. I won’t come bothering around. Any time you see something’s up, in the night, just skip right around and maow.”",

The invitations were sent out before sunset, and straightway the young folks of the village were thrown into a fever of preparation and pleasurable anticipation.

This news delighted Tom, for it meant the return of Becky, and he had been brooding a good deal, lately, over his troubles and embarrassments connected with Injun Joe and the treasure. The news put all that out of his head in an instant. The thought of Becky Thatcher was paramount, now. He must see her at once. He ran to school, and was the first boy on the ground. But Becky was not there, yet. He sat down on the stile, and waited, and watched. By and by a few girls appeared, and then some boys, and presently the school-children were flocking in, but still Becky did not come. Tom’s heart began to sink. He was considering whether to go after her, when she arrived, and his anxieties vanished away. He ran to meet her, and she greeted him with a smile that made the air all sunshine and summer-time, and that took the sting all out of his troubles. She was not altered; she was still the same Becky, and she was still his. He was about to speak, when she anticipated him. “Oh, Tom,” she said, “I’m so glad you’re here. I’ve got something to tell you.” “What is it?” “Oh, it’s splendid! We’re going to have a picnic!” Tom’s heart gave a bound. “A picnic! When?” “To-morrow—Saturday. And it’s going to be down the river, and we’ll have a steamboat, and go ever so far, and have a splendid time!” “Oh, goody!” said Tom. “Who’s going?” “Oh, everybody! All the girls and boys in the village. And we’re going to have a band, and a dance, and a supper, and fireworks, and everything!” “Oh, goody!” said Tom again. “I’m so glad! I’ll go, of course. And I’ll take you.” “Oh, Tom!” said Becky, and her eyes sparkled. “It will be splendid!” They were surrounded by the other children, now, and the news was flying from mouth to mouth.

It was not the custom for elderly people to mar the picnics with their presence. The children were considered safe enough under the wings of a few young ladies of eighteen and a few young gentlemen of twenty-three or thereabouts. The old steam ferry-boat was chartered for the occasion; presently the gay throng filed up the main street laden with provision-baskets. Sid was sick and had to miss the fun; Mary remained at home to entertain him. The last thing Mrs. Thatcher said to Becky, was:\n“You’ll not get back till late. Perhaps you’d better stay all night with some of the girls that live near the ferry-landing, child.”\n“Then I’ll stay with Susy Harper, mamma.”\n“Very well. And mind and behave yourself and don’t be any trouble.”\nPresently, as they tripped along, Tom said to Becky:\n“Say—I’ll tell you what we’ll do. ’Stead of going to Joe Harper’s we’ll climb right up the hill and stop at the Widow Douglas’. She’ll have ice-cream! She has it most every day—dead loads of it. And she’ll be awful glad to have us.”\n“Oh, that will be fun!”\nThen Becky reflected a moment and said:\n“But what will mamma say?”\n“How’ll she ever know?”\nThe girl turned the idea over in her mind, and said reluctantly:\n“I reckon it’s wrong—but—”\n“But shucks! Your mother won’t know, and so what’s the harm? All she wants is that you’ll be safe; and I bet you she’d ’a’ said go there if she’d ’a’ thought of it. I know she would!”\nThe Widow Douglas’ splendid hospitality was a tempting bait. It and Tom’s persuasions presently carried the day. So it was decided to say nothing to anybody about the night’s programme. Presently it occurred to Tom that maybe Huck might come this very night and give the signal. The thought took a deal of the spirit out of his anticipations. Still he could not bear to give up the fun at Widow Douglas’. And why should he give it up, he reasoned—the signal did not come the night before, so why should it be any more likely to come tonight? The sure fun of the evening outweighed the uncertain treasure; and, boy-like, he determined to yield to the stronger inclination and not allow himself to think of the box of money another time that day.",

It was not the custom for the older people to join in these excursions—they stayed at home and discussed the children, and prepared for the onslaught that was sure to follow the evening’s surrender. Dining-room tables were set, and laden; kitchen fires were glowing; servants were hurrying back and forth with quadrupeds and bipeds under foot and over head, and both utterly in the way. The picnicers were to go in a steam ferry-boat. She was chartered for the occasion. When the time to start arrived, the crowd filed down the river bank, and embarked. Everybody was profusely laden with small baskets, and bigger baskets, and boxes, and bundles, and bottles, and bags, and shawls, and umbrellas, and youngters. “Indiantown” was the word. Half an hour later they were landed on a grassy flat \"a mile above the village, and the fun began. It consisted of such diversions as youths and maidens delight in; fishing, wading, swimming, rowing, sailing, taking a short skiff-trip to a small island, hunting shells in the shoals, playing tag the length of the island, pranking and skylarking with such boisterousness as the great trees might stand it but the woodsmen could hardly. Fresh aid came constantly from the village. When they got hungry, about noon, they spread their baskets and feasted. There was abundance of ham, and chicken, and beef, and bread, and butter, and doughnuts, and pie, and coffee, and lemonade, and milk. Everybody ate till the ache was there. Plenty remained over, when the picnicers returned to the boat, at three o’clock. They had taken a good long rest, they were soaked with contentment and exhaustless happiness, and they had had the kind of day we used to have twenty or thirty years ago, before these graceless times came in; yes, and they needed no tanks or pipes to make them merry, either. The last thing that was done was to declare that it had been the jolliest day they had ever spent, and to invite everybody to come to a picnic next year. By this time the sun was beginning to sink. When they reached the village, Becky Thatcher said she was not tired, and she was not going home she was going to spend the afternoon with her mother, and sleep with Susy Harper. Her mother said she could do it; and added: “Mind, now, Becky, if Mrs. Harper asks you to stay all night, be sure and say yes.” Becky laughed, and said: “Why, mamma, you know Susy always asks me to stay all night.” Mrs. Thatcher said: “Well, at any rate, don’t forget to tell her I give you leave; and be sure and behave yourself, and don’t get into any mischief.” With that she turned away, and Becky went off with her mother. Tom Sawyer was with them, and when they got to the Thatcher gate, he said: “Becky, I’m going to stay with you to-night.” Becky said: “Oh, Tom, that will be splendid! But what will mamma say?” Tom said: “She won’t say anything. She won’t know.” Becky said: “But I’m going to stay with Susy Harper.” Tom said: “Oh, that’s all right.

It was not the custom for the older people to join in these excursions—they stayed at home and discussed the children, and prepared for the onslaught that was sure to follow the evening’s surrender. Dining-room tables were set, and laden; kitchen fires were glowing; servants were hurrying back and forth with quadrupeds and bipeds under foot and over head, and both utterly in the way. The picnicers were to go in a steam ferry-boat. She was chartered for the occasion. When the time to start arrived, the crowd filed down the river bank, and embarked. Everybody was profusely laden with small baskets, and bigger baskets, and boxes, and bundles, and bottles, and bags, and shawls, and umbrellas, and youngters. “Indiantown” was the word. Half an hour later they were landed on a grassy flat \"a mile above the village, and the fun began. It consisted of such diversions as youths and maidens delight in; fishing, wading, swimming, rowing, sailing, taking a short skiff-trip to a small island, hunting shells in the shoals, playing tag the length of the island, pranking and skylarking with such boisterousness as the great trees might stand it but the woodsmen could hardly. Fresh aid came constantly from the village. When they got hungry, about noon, they spread their baskets and feasted. There was abundance of ham, and chicken, and beef, and bread, and butter, and doughnuts, and pie, and coffee, and lemonade, and milk. Everybody ate till the ache was there. Plenty remained over, when the picnicers returned to the boat, at three o’clock. They had taken a good long rest, they were soaked with contentment and exhaustless happiness, and they had had the kind of day we used to have twenty or thirty years ago, before these graceless times came in; yes, and they needed no tanks or pipes to make them merry, either. The last thing that was done was to declare that it had been the jolliest day they had ever spent, and to invite everybody to come to a picnic next year. By this time the sun was beginning to sink. When they reached the village, Becky Thatcher said she was not tired, and she was not going home she was going to spend the afternoon with her mother, and sleep with Susy Harper. Her mother said she could do it; and added: “Mind, now, Becky, if Mrs. Harper asks you to stay all night, be sure and say yes.” Becky laughed, and said: “Why, mamma, you know Susy always asks me to stay all night.” Mrs. Thatcher said: “Well, at any rate, don’t forget to tell her I give you leave; and be sure and behave yourself, and don’t get into any mischief.” With that she turned away, and Becky went off with her mother. Tom Sawyer was with them, and when they got to the Thatcher gate, he said: “Becky, I’m going to stay with you to-night.” Becky said: “Oh, Tom, that will be splendid! But what will mamma say?” Tom said: “She won’t say anything. She won’t know.” Becky said: “But I’m going to stay with Susy Harper.” Tom said: “Oh, that’s all right. We’ll stay with Susy Harper.” Becky said: “But Susy Harper is a girl.” Tom said: “Oh, that’s all right.

The crowd swarmed ashore and soon the forest distances and craggy heights echoed far and near with shoutings and laughter. All the different ways of getting hot and tired were gone through with, and by-and-by the rovers straggled back to camp fortified with responsible appetites, and then the destruction of the good things began. After the feast there was a refreshing season of rest and chat in the shade of spreading oaks. By-and-by somebody shouted:\n“Who’s ready for the cave?”\nEverybody was. Bundles of candles were procured, and straightway there was a general scamper up the hill. The mouth of the cave was up the hillside—an opening shaped like a letter A. Its massive oaken door stood unbarred. Within was a small chamber, chilly as an icehouse, and walled by Nature with solid limestone that was dewy with a cold sweat. It was romantic and mysterious to stand here in the deep gloom and look out upon the green valley shining in the sun. But the impressiveness of the situation quickly wore off, and the romping began again. The moment a candle was lighted there was a general rush upon the owner of it; a struggle and a gallant defence followed, but the candle was soon knocked down or blown out, and then there was a glad clamor of laughter and a new chase. But all things have an end. By-and-by the procession went filing down the steep descent of the main avenue, the flickering rank of lights dimly revealing the lofty walls of rock almost to their point of junction sixty feet overhead. This main avenue was not more than eight or ten feet wide. Every few steps other lofty and still narrower crevices branched from it on either hand—for McDougal’s cave was but a vast labyrinth of crooked aisles that ran into each other and out again and led nowhere. It was said that one might wander days and nights together through its intricate tangle of rifts and chasms, and never find the end of the cave; and that he might go down, and down, and still down, into the earth, and it was just the same—labyrinth under labyrinth, and no end to any of them. No man “knew” the cave. That was an impossible thing. Most of the young men knew a portion of it, and it was not customary to venture much beyond this known portion. Tom Sawyer knew as much of the cave as any one.",

The crowd swarmed ashore and disappeared up the long gulch in a minute. They floundered through the warm sand to the cool woods, and disappeared from view. They ploughed their way through the thick undergrowth, laughing, chattering, shriek- ing with devouring ecstasy over every new promise of peril that offered. The forest teemed with game; the camp-fires smoked up out of a hundred little dim glades and copses, hidden here and there in the great deeps of the woods; the axes of the woodchoppers rung somewhere in the distance. The music of the birds was everywhere, and sweet and fresh and mellow and joyous with nature. There were many little streams, tributary to the main one, that wound their way through the glades and copses and wooded dells, and all of them were paved with white sand and pebbly, and all of them were clear and cold and limpid. The air was full of the fragrance of flowers and of the smell of the woods, and the sunshine filtered down through the leaves, and the shadows lay long and black and still. The picnic party scattered themselves about in the woods, and the children played and romped and shouted and laughed and sang and danced and tumbled about and chased each other and climbed trees and swung on grapevines and waded in the streams and built dams and made mud pies and played hide-and-seek and tag and marbles and jackstraws and everything else that children play. The grown people sat in the shade and talked and laughed and ate and drank and smoked and told stories and sang songs and played cards and read books and did everything else that grown people do. The day was perfect. The sun was warm but not too hot, the air was clear and bracing, the sky was blue and cloudless, the birds sang, the flowers bloomed, the trees rustled, the streams murmured, the children shouted, the grown people laughed, and the whole world was happy. After a while the children began to get tired and hungry, and the grown people began to get tired and thirsty, and so they all went back to the camp-fires and ate and drank and rested. After they had rested a while, they began to talk about going into the cave. The cave was a great curiosity. It was a vast, intricate labyrinth, with miles and miles of winding passages, and it was said that no one had ever explored it all. It was a place of mystery and romance, and it was said that there were hidden treasures in it, and that there were ghosts and goblins and other uncanny things. The children were eager to go into the cave, and the grown people were willing to go with them. So they all got up and went to the cave. The entrance to the cave was high up on the side of a hill, and it was a great, black, yawning hole. The children were a little afraid to go in, but they were ashamed to show it, so they all went in together. The cave was dark and cold and damp, and the air was heavy and musty. The children shivered a little, but they were determined to go on. They lit their candles and went on into the cave. The passage was narrow and winding, and the walls were rough and wet. The children went on and on, and the passage grew narrower and narrower, and the walls grew rougher and wetter. The children began to get tired and discouraged, but they were ashamed to turn back, so they went on and on. After a while they came to a place where the passage opened out into a large chamber. The chamber was high and wide, and the walls were smooth and dry. The children were glad to get out of the narrow passage, and they sat down to rest. While they were resting, they began to talk about the cave. They talked about how big it was, and how many passages there were, and how far they had come, and how far they had to go. They talked about the hidden treasures and the ghosts and goblins and other uncanny things. They talked about how they would explore the whole cave and find all the hidden treasures and see all the ghosts and goblins and other uncanny things. They talked about how they would be famous and rich and happy. While they were talking, they heard a noise. It was a faint, far-off noise, but it was a noise. They listened, and the noise grew louder and louder. It was the sound of voices. The children were frightened, and they huddled together. The voices came nearer and nearer, and the children could hear what they were saying. They were talking about the hidden treasures and the ghosts and goblins and other uncanny things. The children were terrified, and they were about to run away, when they heard a voice that they knew. It was the voice of Tom Sawyer. The children were so glad to hear Tom's voice that they forgot to be afraid. They shouted and ran towards the sound of his voice. Tom was with a party of grown people, and they were exploring the cave. Tom was surprised to see the children, and he asked them what they were doing there.

It would be absurd—the men would get away with the box and never be found again. No, he would stick to their wake and follow them; he would trust to the darkness for security from discovery. So communing with himself, Huck stepped out and glided along behind the men, cat-like, with bare feet, allowing them to keep just far enough ahead not to be invisible.\nThey moved up the river street three blocks, then turned to the left up a crossstreet. They went straight ahead, then, until they came to the path that led up Cardiff Hill; this they took. They passed by the old Welshman’s house, halfway up the hill, without hesitating, and still climbed upward. Good, thought Huck, they will bury it in the old quarry. But they never stopped at the quarry. They passed on, up the summit. They plunged into the narrow path between the tall sumach bushes, and were at once hidden in the gloom. Huck closed up and shortened his distance, now, for they would never be able to see him. He trotted along awhile; then slackened his pace, fearing he was gaining too fast; moved on a piece, then stopped altogether; listened; no sound; none, save that he seemed to hear the beating of his own heart. The hooting of an owl came over the hill—ominous sound! But no footsteps. Heavens, was everything lost! He was about to spring with winged feet, when a man cleared his throat not four feet from him! Huck’s heart shot into his throat, but he swallowed it again; and then he stood there shaking as if a dozen agues had taken charge of him at once, and so weak that he thought he must surely fall to the ground. He knew where he was. He knew he was within five steps of the stile leading into Widow Douglas’ grounds. Very well, he thought, let them bury it there; it won’t be hard to find.",

MAJOR STRUCTURAL ISSUES:\n- The completion introduces a lengthy, repetitive sequence where the characters pass by numerous locations (such as the graveyard, haunted house, schoolhouse, church, jail, courthouse, bank, post-office, drug-store, grocery-store, blacksmith-shop, shoe-shop, tailor-shop, etc.), each accompanied by Huck's reflections on his fears. This entire section is invented and does not appear in the original passage.\n- The completion omits the original's climactic moment near the end, where Huck experiences a sudden fright due to a man clearing his throat nearby, and his physical reaction to this event.\n- The completion does not reach the original's conclusion, where Huck realizes his proximity to a specific location and makes a decision about the treasure.\n\n2. MISSING ELEMENTS:\n- The completion lacks the original's detailed description of Huck's stealthy pursuit, including his adjustments to distance and pace as he follows the men.\n- The internal reasoning Huck uses to decide not to fetch Tom and instead continue following the men is only partially represented; the original provides more depth to his thought process.\n- The completion omits the atmospheric details present in the original, such as the darkness, the specific path taken, and the environmental sounds (like the owl's hoot) that contribute to the tension.\n- The original's sequence of the men passing specific, relevant landmarks (such as the Welshman's house and the quarry) is not accurately followed; instead, the completion adds many unrelated locations.\n- The moment of suspense and Huck's heightened anxiety as he listens for sounds and fears discovery is missing.\n\n3. INACCURATE ELEMENTS:\n- The completion provides inaccurate or invented details about Huck's location at the start, referencing a recent fire and the haunted house, which are not part of this scene.\n- The sequence of events is altered: the completion has the men and Huck passing a long list of locations in a repetitive pattern, which does not match the original's concise and purposeful route.\n- Huck's emotional responses are misrepresented; the completion repeatedly uses a formulaic structure of fear and relief for each location, which is not present in the original.\n- The completion fails to accurately portray the timing and order of key events, such as the men being hidden in the gloom, Huck closing the distance, and the sudden interruption near the stile.\n- The ending is left incomplete, missing the resolution and Huck's final thoughts about the treasure's location."

A deadly chill went to Huck’s heart—this, then, was the “revenge” job! His thought was, to fly. Then he remembered that the Widow Douglas had been kind to him more than once, and maybe these men were going to murder her. He wished he dared venture to warn her; but he knew he didn’t dare—they might come and catch him. He thought all this and more in the moment that elapsed between the stranger’s remark and Injun Joe’s next—which was—\n“Because the bush is in your way. Now—this way—now you see, don’t you?”\n“Yes. Well, there is company there, I reckon. Better give it up.”\n“Give it up, and I just leaving this country forever! Give it up and maybe never have another chance. I tell you again, as I’ve told you before, I don’t care for her swag—you may have it. But her husband was rough on me—many times he was rough on me—and mainly he was the justice of the peace that jugged me for a vagrant. And that ain’t all. It ain’t a millionth part of it! He had me horsewhipped!—horsewhipped in front of the jail, like a nigger!—with all the town looking on! Horsewhipped!—do you understand? He took advantage of me and died. But I’ll take it out of her.”\n“Oh, don’t kill her! Don’t do that!”\n“Kill? Who said anything about killing? I would kill him if he was here; but not her. When you want to get revenge on a woman you don’t kill her—bosh! you go for her looks. You slit her nostrils—you notch her ears like a sow!”\n“By God, that’s—”\n“Keep your opinion to yourself! It will be safest for you. I’ll tie her to the bed. If she bleeds to death, is that my fault? I’ll not cry, if she does. My friend, you’ll help me in this thing—for my sake—that’s why you’re here—I mightn’t be able alone. If you flinch, I’ll kill you. Do you understand that? And if I have to kill you, I’ll kill her—and then I reckon nobody’ll ever know much about who done this business.”\n“Well, if it’s got to be done, let’s get at it. The quicker the better—I’m all in a shiver.”\n“Do it now? And company there? Look here—I’ll get suspicious of you, first thing you know. No—we’ll wait till the lights are out—there’s no hurry.",

Huck felt a sudden chill—the thought flashed upon him, “It’s the revenge!” Injun Joe had said he would lay in wait for the Widow, and said it was revenge for some slight that she had put upon him, many a year ago. Huck’s first impulse was to turn and fly; but his legs refused to carry him. His heart seemed to stand still; he was so frightened he couldn’t move. He wished he had the courage to run to the Widow Douglas’s and warn her, but he knew he didn’t have it. He was afraid they would catch him. He was so scared he couldn’t even think. He stood there, rooted to the spot, listening.\n\nInjun Joe said:\n\n“A bush hides ’em. Now you see ’em.

MAJOR STRUCTURAL ISSUES:\n- The completion invents an extended, repetitive exchange between the two characters that is not present in the original. The original passage contains a tense, detailed conversation with specific threats and motivations, while the completion replaces this with a cyclical, almost comedic dialogue that does not reflect the original structure or tone.\n- The completion omits the internal perspective and emotional reaction of Huck, which is a significant part of the original's early section.\n- The completion does not include the detailed explanation of Injun Joe's motives and the specific nature of his planned revenge, which are central to the original passage.\n\n2. MISSING ELEMENTS:\n- The completion lacks the initial observation about the lights and the suspicion regarding company at the Widow Douglas's house, which sets the scene and the characters' intentions.\n- There is no mention of the moment of hesitation and fear experienced by Huck, nor his internal debate about warning the Widow Douglas.\n- The specific threats and the plan for revenge, including the details of what Injun Joe intends to do, are missing.\n- The completion does not include the negotiation and tension between the two men about whether to proceed with their plan, nor the ultimatum and threats made by Injun Joe to his accomplice.\n- The passage's conclusion, which involves the decision to wait until the lights are out, is absent.\n\n3. INACCURATE ELEMENTS:\n- The completion inaccurately attributes a motivation to Injun Joe that is not present in the original, focusing on a personal vendetta for being driven out of town and being given food, rather than the more complex and specific grievances described in the original.\n- The sequence of events is altered, with the invented dialogue replacing the original's progression from observation, to internal reflection, to confrontation and planning.\n- The completion repeatedly asserts an intention to kill the Widow Douglas, which misrepresents the original character's stated plan and the nature of his revenge.\n- The tone and style of the dialogue are inconsistent with the original, lacking the menace and specificity of the threats and instead relying on repetitive phrasing.\n- The completion introduces invented lines and exchanges that do not exist in the original, distorting the narrative and character dynamics."

He knocked urgently on the door, and soon the old man and his two strong sons appeared at the windows demanding to know who was there and what they wanted. Huck identified himself and pleaded to be let in quickly, promising to explain everything. The Welshman, remarking that Huckleberry Finn was not a name that usually opened doors, nevertheless instructed his sons to let him in to see what the matter was. Once inside, Huck’s first words were a plea for them never to reveal that he was the one who told them, expressing fear of being killed, but stating he had to tell because the widow had been kind to him. The old man, convinced by Huck’s earnestness that he had something important to say, promised that no one there would betray him. Three minutes later, the Welshman and his sons, armed, were heading up the hill, entering the sumach path stealthily with weapons ready. Huck did not go further with them. He concealed himself behind a large boulder and listened intently. After a period of tense silence, there was a sudden sound of gunfire and a shout. Huck did not stay to learn more; he immediately ran away, speeding down the hill as fast as his legs could take him.",

                "text": "Huck felt that a silence was going to ensue—a thing still more awful than any amount of murderous talk; so he held his breath and stepped gingerly back; planted his foot carefully and firmly, after balancing, one-legged, in a precarious way and almost toppling over, first on one side and then on the other. He took another step back, with the same meticulous care, and then another, and—notwithstanding every effort to avoid it—his foot loosened a twig and it snapped. He froze instantly, and strained his ears. There was no sound—the stillness was absolute. He was grateful for it. He took another step, and another, cautiously, and then turned and stole away, gliding along the path, between the sumach bushes, with as noiseless a movement as a ship before the wind. He reached the quarry, safe from detection, and then ran as fast as he could down the hill till he came to the Welshman’s house. He hammered at the door with all his might. Presently the door was unbarred, and a big, husky man stood in the opening, and an old man and two sturdy sons were at his back. “What do you want?” the big man said. “It’s me—Huck Finn! I want to come in—quick! I mean to tell you something.” “Huck Finn? Huck Finn! This ain’t no place for Huck Finn to be prowling around in the night. What do you mean by this racket?” “Please—please let me in! I’ve got something to tell you—something awful.” “Speak out! What is it?” “I can’t do it here, sir. Please let me in.” The old man said: “Let him in, Jake, and see what’s the matter. Don’t you be afraid, Huck; nobody’s a-going to hurt you.” “Oh, please don’t ever tell anybody I told you,” whispered Huck, half crying. “I’d be killed, sure. Please don’t—you won’t, will you?” “No, nobody will tell. What is it?” “I—I couldn’t help it, sir. I had to tell, because they was so good to me—the widow and all.” “Well, speak out, speak out! Don’t stand there shivering and dallying!” “They’re here, sir—in the cave.” “Who?” “Injun Joe and the Spaniard.” “No! You don’t mean it.” “It’s true, sir. I saw them. They’re in the cave, and they’ve got the money.” “The money? What money?” “The money they stole from the widow.” “No! You don’t mean it.” “It’s true, sir. I saw them. They’re in the cave, and they’ve got the money.” “The money? What money?” “The money they stole from the widow.” “Hold on, hold on! Don’t you be afraid, Huck. We’ll take care of you. Now, tell us all about it.” Huck told his story, and the old man and his sons listened with breathless interest. When he had finished, the old man said: “Well, I’ll be blamed! This is the most extraordinary thing I ever heard of. Now, Huck, you stay here, and we’ll go and see about this.” The old man and his sons armed themselves and set out. Huck did not go with them. He concealed himself behind a large boulder and listened intently. After a period of tense silence, there was a sudden sound of gunfire and a shout.

MAJOR STRUCTURAL ISSUES:\n- The completion introduces invented details in the early part of the passage, such as a pebble rolling into a crevice and a character attributing a noise to the wind, which are not present in the original.\n- There is an invented exchange between the men that Huck is observing, which does not occur in the source material.\n\n2. MISSING ELEMENTS:\n- The completion omits the specific incident of a twig snapping under Huck's foot, which is a key event in the original sequence.\n- The description of Huck's gratitude for the silence and his careful turning between the sumach bushes is less detailed, missing the metaphor comparing his movement to a ship.\n- The dialogue at the Welshman’s house is condensed and lacks the full sequence of questions and responses, as well as the specific plea Huck makes upon entering.\n- The completion does not include the explicit mention of the old man and his sons being well armed before heading up the hill.\n- The final moments, including Huck hiding behind a boulder and the anxious silence before the gunfire, are less developed and miss the sense of suspense present in the original.\n\n3. INACCURATE ELEMENTS:\n- Early in the passage, the completion inaccurately describes the cause and nature of the noise Huck makes, substituting a pebble for the original event.\n- The sequence of Huck’s retreat and the reactions of the men is altered, with invented dialogue and actions that do not match the original order.\n- The completion changes the nature of Huck’s plea to the Welshman, making it more general and less specific than in the original.\n- The description of the Welshman’s response and the subsequent actions of his sons are paraphrased in a way that alters the tone and sequence of the original events.\n- The final action sequence, including the gunfire and Huck’s reaction, is summarized rather than following the original pacing and detail."

The inmates were asleep, but it was a sleep that was set on a hair-trigger, on account of the exciting episode of the night. A call came from a window:\n“Who’s there!”\nHuck’s scared voice answered in a low tone:\n“Please let me in! It’s only Huck Finn!”\n“It’s a name that can open this door night or day, lad!—and welcome!”\nThese were strange words to the vagabond boy’s ears, and the pleasantest he had ever heard. He could not recollect that the closing word had ever been applied in his case before. The door was quickly unlocked, and he entered. Huck was given a seat and the old man and his brace of tall sons speedily dressed themselves.\n“Now, my boy, I hope you’re good and hungry, because breakfast will be ready as soon as the sun’s up, and we’ll have a piping hot one, too—make yourself easy about that! I and the boys hoped you’d turn up and stop here last night.”\n“I was awful scared,” said Huck, “and I run. I took out when the pistols went off, and I didn’t stop for three mile. I’ve come now becuz I wanted to know about it, you know; and I come before daylight becuz I didn’t want to run across them devils, even if they was dead.”\n“Well, poor chap, you do look as if you’d had a hard night of it—but there’s a bed here for you when you’ve had your breakfast. No, they ain’t dead, lad—we are sorry enough for that. You see we knew right where to put our hands on them, by your description; so we crept along on tiptoe till we got within fifteen feet of them—dark as a cellar that sumach path was—and just then I found I was going to sneeze. It was the meanest kind of luck! I tried to keep it back, but no use—’twas bound to come, and it did come! I was in the lead with my pistol raised, and when the sneeze started those scoundrels a-rustling to get out of the path, I sung out, ‘Fire boys!’ and blazed away at the place where the rustling was. So did the boys. But they were off in a jiffy, those villains, and we after them, down through the woods. I judge we never touched them. They fired a shot apiece as they started, but their bullets whizzed by and didn’t do us any harm. As soon as we lost the sound of their feet we quit chasing, and went down and stirred up the constables. They got a posse together, and went off to guard the river bank, and as soon as it is light the sheriff and a gang are going to beat up the woods. My boys will be with them presently. I wish we had some sort of description of those rascals—’twould help a good deal. But you couldn’t see what they were like, in the dark, lad, I suppose?”\n“Oh yes; I saw them downtown and follered them.”\n“Splendid! Describe them—describe them, my boy!”\n“One’s the old deaf and dumb Spaniard that’s ben around here once or twice, and t’other’s a mean-looking, ragged—”\n“That’s enough, lad, we know the men! Happened on them in the woods back of the widow’s one day, and they slunk away. Off with you, boys, and tell the sheriff—get your breakfast tomorrow morning!”",

Oh, please!”\n“All right if you say it, Huck, but you ought to have the credit of what you did.”\n“Oh no, no! Please don’t tell!”\nWhen the young men were gone, the old Welshman said:\n“They won’t tell—and I won’t. But why don’t you want it known?”\nHuck would not explain, further than to say that he already knew too much about one of those men and would not have the man know that he knew anything against him for the whole world—he would be killed for knowing it, sure.\nThe old man promised secrecy once more, and said:\n“How did you come to follow these fellows, lad? Were they looking suspicious?”\nHuck was silent while he framed a duly cautious reply. Then he said:\n“Well, you see, I’m a kind of a hard lot,—least everybody says so, and I don’t see nothing agin it—and sometimes I can’t sleep much, on account of thinking about it and sort of trying to strike out a new way of doing. That was the way of it last night. I couldn’t sleep, and so I come along upstreet ’bout midnight, a-turning it all over, and when I got to that old shackly brick store by the Temperance Tavern, I backed up agin the wall to have another think. Well, just then along comes these two chaps slipping along close by me, with something under their arm, and I reckoned they’d stole it. One was a-smoking, and t’other one wanted a light; so they stopped right before me and the cigars lit up their faces and I see that the big one was the deaf and dumb Spaniard, by his white whiskers and the patch on his eye, and t’other one was a rusty, ragged-looking devil.”\n“Could you see the rags by the light of the cigars?”\nThis staggered Huck for a moment. Then he said:\n“Well, I don’t know—but somehow it seems as if I did.”\n“Then they went on, and you—”\n“Follered ’em—yes. That was it. I wanted to see what was up—they sneaked along so. I dogged ’em to the widder’s stile, and stood in the dark and heard the ragged one beg for the widder, and the Spaniard swear he’d spile her looks just as I told you and your two—”\n“What! The deaf and dumb man said all that!”\nHuck had made another terrible mistake! He was trying his best to keep the old man from getting the faintest hint of who the Spaniard might be, and yet his tongue seemed determined to get him into trouble in spite of all he could do. He made several efforts to creep out of his scrape, but the old man’s eye was upon him and he made blunder after blunder. Presently the Welshman said:\n“My boy, don’t be afraid of me. I wouldn’t hurt a hair of your head for all the world. No—I’d protect you—I’d protect you. This Spaniard is not deaf and dumb; you’ve let that slip without intending it; you can’t cover that up now. You know something about that Spaniard that you want to keep dark. Now trust me—tell me what it is, and trust me—I won’t betray you.”\nHuck looked into the old man’s honest eyes a moment, then bent over and whispered in his ear:\n“’Tain’t a Spaniard—it’s Injun Joe!”\nThe Welshman almost jumped out of his chair. In a moment he said:\n“It’s all plain enough, now. When you talked about notching ears and slitting noses I judged that that was your own embellishment, because white men don’t take that sort of revenge. But an Injun! That’s a different matter altogether.”",

I—I am afraid to have it known, sir.”\n“Well, I don’t know what the law would do, but we’ll stand by you right smart. Give me your hand, Huck, you’re a brave boy. Don’t be afraid, nobody shall hurt you. Now, where did you come across this gang, anyway?\"\nHuck told the whole story, faithfully, right up to the moment of the murder of the doctor; telling it exactly as the reader has heard it before. He closed by saying:\n“I begun to get scared, not just then, but by and by, when I thought the thing over. And I was scared when I see that the Spaniard was that deaf and dumb Spaniard that hangs around here, and I remembered him a time or two, and then I begun to think, and thought he was a mighty soft-spoken chap for a Spaniard.”\n“As soft-spoken as you be!” said the Welshman, sardonically. “You little rascal, you were asleep, were you, when I asked you what the Spaniard said?”\nHuck was confused and distressed. He said:\n“I—I—well, I couldn’t help it, you know. I didn’t mean to tell, but I did.”\n“Never mind, son, don’t you worry about it. I ain’t going to tell anybody. Dark as it is, I hope I can see who you are. So you ain’t deaf and dumb, hey?”\n“No, sir. You see, when I was telling you about that, I—I—well, I was trying to keep it from coming out. I didn’t want to tell on anybody, you know.”\n“That’s all right, Huck, I understand. Now, tell me, who is this Spaniard?\"\n“Well, sir, he ain’t a Spaniard.”\n“Not a Spaniard?\"\n“No, sir. He’s Injun Joe.”\nThe Welshman almost let Huck fall, he was so startled. Poor Huck trembled from head to foot. The Welshman recovered himself, however, and said:\n“Injun Joe!

Huck said:\n“Please don’t ever tell anybody it was me that blowed on them, please, sir.\"\n“All right,” said the Welshman. “What makes you ask that?”\n“Because if it ever got out, they’d murder me, sure.”\n“What! they wouldn’t venture to do that, would they?”\n“They would, sir, they passed a remark about it. I—I am afraid to have it known, sir.”\n“Well, I don’t know what the law would do, but we’ll stand by you right smart. Give me your hand, Huck, you’re a brave boy. Don’t be afraid, nobody shall hurt you. Now, where did you come across this gang, anyway?\"\nHuck told the whole story, faithfully, right up to the moment of the murder of the doctor; telling it exactly as the reader has heard it before. He closed by saying:\n“I begun to get scared, not just then, but by and by, when I thought the thing over. And I was scared when I see that the Spaniard was that deaf and dumb Spaniard that hangs around here, and I remembered him a time or two, and then I begun to think, and thought he was a mighty soft-spoken chap for a Spaniard.”\n“As soft-spoken as you be!” said the Welshman, sardonically. “You little rascal, you were asleep, were you, when I asked you what the Spaniard said?”\nHuck was confused and distressed. He said:\n“I—I—well, I couldn’t help it, you know. I didn’t mean to tell, but I did.”\n“Never mind, son, don’t you worry about it. I ain’t going to tell anybody. Dark as it is, I hope I can see who you are. So you ain’t deaf and dumb, hey?”\n“No, sir. You see, when I was telling you about that, I—I—well, I was trying to keep it from coming out. I didn’t want to tell on anybody, you know.”\n“That’s all right, Huck, I understand. Now, tell me, who is this Spaniard?\"\n“Well, sir, he ain’t a Spaniard.”\n“Not a Spaniard?\"\n“No, sir. He’s Injun Joe.”\nThe Welshman almost let Huck fall, he was so startled. Poor Huck trembled from head to foot. The Welshman recovered himself, however, and said:\n“Injun Joe!

His eyes were staring wide, now, and his breath suspended—waiting for the answer. The Welshman started—stared in return—three seconds—five seconds—ten—then replied:\n“Of burglar’s tools. Why, what’s the matter with you?”\nHuck sank back, panting gently, but deeply, unutterably grateful. The Welshman eyed him gravely, curiously—and presently said:\n“Yes, burglar’s tools. That appears to relieve you a good deal. But what did give you that turn? What were you expecting we’d found?”\nHuck was in a close place—the inquiring eye was upon him—he would have given anything for material for a plausible answer—nothing suggested itself—the inquiring eye was boring deeper and deeper—a senseless reply offered—there was no time to weigh it, so at a venture he uttered it—feebly:\n“Sunday-school books, maybe.”\nPoor Huck was too distressed to smile, but the old man laughed loud and joyously, shook up the details of his anatomy from head to foot, and ended by saying that such a laugh was money in a-man’s pocket, because it cut down the doctor’s bill like everything. Then he added:\n“Poor old chap, you’re white and jaded—you ain’t well a bit—no wonder you’re a little flighty and off your balance. But you’ll come out of it. Rest and sleep will fetch you out all right, I hope.”\nHuck was irritated to think he had been such a goose and betrayed such a suspicious excitement, for he had dropped the idea that the parcel brought from the tavern was the treasure, as soon as he had heard the talk at the widow’s stile. He had only thought it was not the treasure, however—he had not known that it wasn’t—and so the suggestion of a captured bundle was too much for his self-possession. But on the whole he felt glad the little episode had happened, for now he knew beyond all question that that bundle was not the bundle, and so his mind was at rest and exceedingly comfortable. In fact, everything seemed to be drifting just in the right direction, now; the treasure must be still in No. 2, the men would be captured and jailed that day, and he and Tom could seize the gold that night without any trouble or any fear of interruption.",

The Welshman admitted several ladies and gentlemen, among them the Widow Douglas, and noticed that groups of citizens were climbing up the hill—to stare at the stile. So the news had spread. The Welshman had to tell the story of the night to the visitors. The widow’s gratitude for her preservation was outspoken.\n“Don’t say a word about it, madam. There’s another that you’re more beholden to than you are to me and my boys, maybe, but he don’t allow me to tell his name. We wouldn’t have been there but for him.”\nOf course this excited a curiosity so vast that it almost belittled the main matter—but the Welshman allowed it to eat into the vitals of his visitors, and through them be transmitted to the whole town, for he refused to part with his secret. When all else had been learned, the widow said:\n“I went to sleep reading in bed and slept straight through all that noise. Why didn’t you come and wake me?”\n“We judged it warn’t worth while. Those fellows warn’t likely to come again—they hadn’t any tools left to work with, and what was the use of waking you up and scaring you to death? My three negro men stood guard at your house all the rest of the night. They’ve just come back.”\nMore visitors came, and the story had to be told and retold for a couple of hours more.\nThere was no Sabbath-school during day-school vacation, but everybody was early at church. The stirring event was well canvassed. News came that not a sign of the two villains had been yet discovered. When the sermon was finished, Judge Thatcher’s wife dropped alongside of Mrs. Harper as she moved down the aisle with the crowd and said:\n“Is my Becky going to sleep all day? I just expected she would be tired to death.”\n“Your Becky?”\n“Yes,” with a startled look—“didn’t she stay with you last night?”\n“Why, no.”\nMrs. Thatcher turned pale, and sank into a pew, just as Aunt Polly, talking briskly with a friend, passed by. Aunt Polly said:\n“Goodmorning, Mrs. Thatcher. Goodmorning, Mrs. Harper. I’ve got a boy that’s turned up missing. I reckon my Tom stayed at your house last night—one of you. And now he’s afraid to come to church. I’ve got to settle with him.”\nMrs. Thatcher shook her head feebly and turned paler than ever.\n“He didn’t stay with us,” said Mrs. Harper, beginning to look uneasy. A marked anxiety came into Aunt Polly’s face.\n“Joe Harper, have you seen my Tom this morning?”\n“No’m.”\n“When did you see him last?”\nJoe tried to remember, but was not sure he could say. The people had stopped moving out of church. Whispers passed along, and a boding uneasiness took possession of every countenance. Children were anxiously questioned, and young teachers. They all said they had not noticed whether Tom and Becky were on board the ferryboat on the homeward trip; it was dark; no one thought of inquiring if any one was missing. One young man finally blurted out his fear that they were still in the cave! Mrs. Thatcher swooned away. Aunt Polly fell to crying and wringing her hands.",

But I reckon they're friends, because they knocked.\" He stepped aside and admitted a crowd of ladies and gentlemen, among them the Widow Douglas, and everybody greeted Huck with a glad shout. The news had spread like wildfire, and the town was in a ferment. The Welshman told the story of the night's adventure, and the Widow Douglas cried and said she didn't know how to be grateful enough. \"But who was the other one?\" she asked. \"The one that gave the alarm?\" \"Ah, that's the mystery,\" said the Welshman. \"He wouldn't give his name. He just said he was a friend and that was enough. But he was a brave lad, whoever he was.\" The Widow Douglas said she wished she could see him and thank him. \"Maybe you will someday,\" said the Welshman. \"He's around somewhere.\" The Widow Douglas said she couldn't understand why they hadn't waked her up. \"We didn't want to scare you,\" said the Welshman. \"And besides, we knew they wouldn't come back without their tools, and your servants were guarding the house.\" Later, at church, the attempted burglary was the talk of the town. Nobody had seen anything of the villains. Then a new anxiety arose. Mrs. Thatcher turned to Mrs. Harper and said: \"Is Becky with you?\" \"No,\" said Mrs. Harper. \"I thought she was with you.\" They looked at each other in dismay.

But I reckon they're friends, because they knocked.\" He stepped aside and admitted a crowd of ladies and gentlemen, among them the Widow Douglas, and everybody greeted Huck with a glad shout. The news had spread like wildfire, and the town was in a ferment. The Welshman told the story of the night's adventure, and the Widow Douglas cried and said she didn't know how to be grateful enough. \"But who was the other one?\" she asked. \"The one that gave the alarm?\" \"Ah, that's the mystery,\" said the Welshman. \"He wouldn't give his name. He just said he was a friend and that was enough. But he was a brave lad, whoever he was.\" The Widow Douglas said she wished she could see him and thank him. \"Maybe you will someday,\" said the Welshman. \"He's around somewhere.\" The Widow Douglas said she couldn't understand why they hadn't waked her up. \"We didn't want to scare you,\" said the Welshman. \"And besides, we knew they wouldn't come back without their tools, and your servants were guarding the house.\" Later, at church, the attempted burglary was the talk of the town. Nobody had seen anything of the villains. Then a new anxiety arose. Mrs. Thatcher turned to Mrs. Harper and said: \"Is Becky with you?\" \"No,\" said Mrs. Harper. \"I thought she was with you.\" They looked at each other in dismay.

The Cardiff Hill episode sank into instant insignificance, the burglars were forgotten, horses were saddled, skiffs were manned, the ferryboat ordered out, and before the horror was half an hour old, two hundred men were pouring down highroad and river toward the cave.\nAll the long afternoon the village seemed empty and dead. Many women visited Aunt Polly and Mrs. Thatcher and tried to comfort them. They cried with them, too, and that was still better than words. All the tedious night the town waited for news; but when the morning dawned at last, all the word that came was, “Send more candles—and send food.” Mrs. Thatcher was almost crazed; and Aunt Polly, also. Judge Thatcher sent messages of hope and encouragement from the cave, but they conveyed no real cheer.\nThe old Welshman came home toward daylight, spattered with candle-grease, smeared with clay, and almost worn out. He found Huck still in the bed that had been provided for him, and delirious with fever. The physicians were all at the cave, so the Widow Douglas came and took charge of the patient. She said she would do her best by him, because, whether he was good, bad, or indifferent, he was the Lord’s, and nothing that was the Lord’s was a thing to be neglected. The Welshman said Huck had good spots in him, and the widow said:\n“You can depend on it. That’s the Lord’s mark. He don’t leave it off. He never does. Puts it somewhere on every creature that comes from his hands.”\nEarly in the forenoon parties of jaded men began to straggle into the village, but the strongest of the citizens continued searching. All the news that could be gained was that remotenesses of the cavern were being ransacked that had never been visited before; that every corner and crevice was going to be thoroughly searched; that wherever one wandered through the maze of passages, lights were to be seen flitting hither and thither in the distance, and shoutings and pistol-shots sent their hollow reverberations to the ear down the sombre aisles. In one place, far from the section usually traversed by tourists, the names “BECKY & TOM” had been found traced upon the rocky wall with candle-smoke, and near at hand a grease-soiled bit of ribbon. Mrs. Thatcher recognized the ribbon and cried over it. She said it was the last relic she should ever have of her child; and that no other memorial of her could ever be so precious, because this one parted latest from the living body before the awful death came. Some said that now and then, in the cave, a far-away speck of light would glimmer, and then a glorious shout would burst forth and a score of men go trooping down the echoing aisle—and then a sickening disappointment always followed; the children were not there; it was only a searcher’s light.",

The Cáceres burglary was not mentioned now. The cave disaster obliterated it from people’s thoughts. The great cave was only two miles distant. In less than half an hour boats were hurrying over the river, and men were galloping off down the dusty road by the bluff. In half an hour more the ferryboat had arrived and safety-lamps were being brought ashore. Two hundred men turned out. Every man of them was earnest and determined. A solemn spirit settled down upon the community. Activities were almost wholly suspended. The villagers stood in little knots talking excitedly, or else in silent groups staring with blank faces towards the cave. By the middle of the afternoon the village seemed deserted. The searchers having long ago passed beyond the limits of returnable news, the waiting public had withdrawn to their homes, there to suffer the anguish of suspense. Only the children remained outside, playing in the great square by the church—for even the adults of the rising generation had tasted the bitterness of death with the passing of little Gracie Miller only the week before. In most houses there was silence and brooding oppression, but in some there was light and cheer and company; the young friends of the lost ones were gathered to speak hopeful words and comfort doubting hearts. They recalled all of Tom’s airy bravado about unity and sharp work, and all of Becky’s sweet nature, and these memories brought so many tears that the comforters broke down and needed comforting themselves. All the afternoon and all the evening the mothers of the missing ones sat by their cradles, or walked restlessly about, or stood at the window listening. The town was dark and still at midnight. There was no sound but the drip of the rain from the eaves, and the far-off baying of a dog. The searchers were still out, but no word had come from them. The town was desolate. By two o’clock the rain had ceased, and the moon rose dimly through the drifting clouds. A little after three came a messenger from the cave, requesting more candles and provisions. He said the search was being pushed with vigor, and that hope was not yet lost. He brought letters from Judge Thatcher and others, but they contained nothing that was encouraging. The Judge’s letter said that he was with the searchers and that they were doing all that men could do; but that he felt very little hope. This was a blow. Mrs. Thatcher fainted away.

In a lucid interval, Huck feebly led up to the subject of taverns, and finally asked—dimly dreading the worst—if anything had been discovered at the Temperance Tavern since he had been ill.\n“Yes,” said the widow.\nHuck started up in bed, wildeyed:\n“What? What was it?”\n“Liquor!—and the place has been shut up. Lie down, child—what a turn you did give me!”\n“Only tell me just one thing—only just one—please! Was it Tom Sawyer that found it?”\nThe widow burst into tears. “Hush, hush, child, hush! I’ve told you before, you must not talk. You are very, very sick!”\nThen nothing but liquor had been found; there would have been a great powwow if it had been the gold. So the treasure was gone forever—gone forever! But what could she be crying about? Curious that she should cry.\nThese thoughts worked their dim way through Huck’s mind, and under the weariness they gave him he fell asleep. The widow said to herself:\n“There—he’s asleep, poor wreck. Tom Sawyer find it! Pity but somebody could find Tom Sawyer!

Presently the hide-and-seek frolicking began, and Tom and Becky engaged in it with zeal until the exertion began to grow a trifle wearisome; then they wandered down a sinuous avenue holding their candles aloft and reading the tangled webwork of names, dates, postoffice addresses, and mottoes with which the rocky walls had been frescoed (in candle-smoke). Still drifting along and talking, they scarcely noticed that they were now in a part of the cave whose walls were not frescoed. They smoked their own names under an overhanging shelf and moved on. Presently they came to a place where a little stream of water, trickling over a ledge and carrying a limestone sediment with it, had, in the slow-dragging ages, formed a laced and ruffled Niagara in gleaming and imperishable stone. Tom squeezed his small body behind it in order to illuminate it for Becky’s gratification.

Tom, ever the explorer, led Becky away from the main group, eager to discover hidden passages and secret chambers. They laughed and chatted, their voices echoing strangely in the gloom. They squeezed through narrow crevices and climbed over slippery rocks, their candles held high. The thrill of adventure was upon them. They found a beautiful, crystal-clear pool and tossed pebbles into it, watching the ripples spread. They followed a winding passage that seemed to promise new wonders around every bend. They were having the time of their lives, completely absorbed in their exploration. They didn't notice how far they had strayed from the others, or how the familiar sounds of the picnic faded behind them. The passage grew narrower, then opened into a large, silent chamber.

They wound this way and that, far down into the secret depths of the cave, made another mark, and branched off in search of novelties to tell the upper world about. In one place they found a spacious cavern, from whose ceiling depended a multitude of shining stalactites of the length and circumference of a man’s leg; they walked all about it, wondering and admiring, and presently left it by one of the numerous passages that opened into it. This shortly brought them to a bewitching spring, whose basin was incrusted with a frostwork of glittering crystals; it was in the midst of a cavern whose walls were supported by many fantastic pillars which had been formed by the joining of great stalactites and stalagmites together, the result of the ceaseless water-drip of centuries. Under the roof vast knots of bats had packed themselves together, thousands in a bunch; the lights disturbed the creatures and they came flocking down by hundreds, squeaking and darting furiously at the candles. Tom knew their ways and the danger of this sort of conduct. He seized Becky’s hand and hurried her into the first corridor that offered; and none too soon, for a bat struck Becky’s light out with its wing while she was passing out of the cavern. The bats chased the children a good distance; but the fugitives plunged into every new passage that offered, and at last got rid of the perilous things. Tom found a subterranean lake, shortly, which stretched its dim length away until its shape was lost in the shadows. He wanted to explore its borders, but concluded that it would be best to sit down and rest awhile, first. Now, for the first time, the deep stillness of the place laid a clammy hand upon the spirits of the children. Becky said:\n“Why, I didn’t notice, but it seems ever so long since I heard any of the others.”\n“Come to think, Becky, we are away down below them—and I don’t know how far away north, or south, or east, or whichever it is. We couldn’t hear them here.”\nBecky grew apprehensive.\n“I wonder how long we’ve been down here, Tom? We better start back.”\n“Yes, I reckon we better. P’raps we better.”\n“Can you find the way, Tom? It’s all a mixed-up crookedness to me.”\n“I reckon I could find it—but then the bats. If they put our candles out it will be an awful fix. Let’s try some other way, so as not to go through there.”\n“Well. But I hope we won’t get lost. It would be so awful!” and the girl shuddered at the thought of the dreadful possibilities.",

The passage they chose was a narrow one, winding and twisting like a serpent's trail, leading them deeper and deeper into the earth's embrace.  The air grew cooler, damp and heavy with the smell of wet stone and ancient darkness.  Their voices, when they spoke, were swallowed by the vast silence, returning only as faint, mocking echoes.  Excitement bubbled within them, a heady mix of adventure and the thrill of the unknown.  They held hands tightly, their fingers intertwined, a small anchor in the immense, unlit world around them.  Strange, grotesque shapes loomed out of the gloom – stalactites like frozen tears hanging from the ceiling, stalagmites rising from the floor like silent sentinels.  Water dripped incessantly, a monotonous, chilling sound that punctuated the stillness.  They explored side passages, each one seemingly more mysterious than the last, their smoke-mark forgotten in the intoxicating rush of discovery.  They saw formations that looked like petrified waterfalls, like sleeping beasts, like gnarled trees reaching skeletal branches into the void.  Time seemed to lose its meaning in this subterranean realm.  Minutes stretched into what felt like hours, yet the desire to see what lay around the next bend, through the next archway, was irresistible.  They laughed, their laughter sounding thin and fragile against the cave's immensity.  They whispered secrets, their voices hushed by the solemnity of the place.  They were explorers, pioneers venturing into uncharted territory, their small candle casting a flickering circle of light against the impenetrable blackness.  But as they ventured further, the passages began to look more and more alike.  The unique features that had marked their path seemed to vanish, replaced by a monotonous repetition of damp walls and dripping stone.  A subtle unease began to creep into their hearts, a cold tendril of doubt winding around their initial excitement.  They stopped, looking back, trying to discern the faint trace of their smoke-mark, but the passage behind them seemed to have closed in, becoming just another dark opening among many.  A shiver, not entirely from the cold, ran down Becky's spine.  Tom, though he tried to maintain a brave front, felt a knot tightening in his stomach.  The silence no longer felt adventurous; it felt oppressive, vast, and indifferent.  The dripping water sounded like a slow, relentless clock counting down to something they didn't want to face.  They called out, their voices now tinged with a tremor of fear, but only the echoes answered, mocking their growing anxiety.  They were lost. The realization hit them with the force of a physical blow, stealing their breath and chilling them to the bone.  The grand adventure had suddenly transformed into a terrifying predicament.  The darkness pressed in closer, no longer just the absence of light, but a palpable, living entity threatening to swallow them whole.  Their small candle seemed pitifully inadequate against the overwhelming blackness.  Panic, cold and sharp, began to prick at the edges of their minds.  They were alone, deep underground, with no idea which way led back to the world above.  The cave, which had moments before been a playground of wonders, had become a labyrinth of despair."

This ain’t the one, but we’ll come to it right away!”\nBut he felt less and less hopeful with each failure, and presently began to turn off into diverging avenues at sheer random, in desperate hope of finding the one that was wanted. He still said it was “all right,” but there was such a leaden dread at his heart that the words had lost their ring and sounded just as if he had said, “All is lost!” Becky clung to his side in an anguish of fear, and tried hard to keep back the tears, but they would come. At last she said:\n“Oh, Tom, never mind the bats, let’s go back that way! We seem to get worse and worse off all the time.”\n“Listen!” said he.\nProfound silence; silence so deep that even their breathings were conspicuous in the hush. Tom shouted. The call went echoing down the empty aisles and died out in the distance in a faint sound that resembled a ripple of mocking laughter.\n“Oh, don’t do it again, Tom, it is too horrid,” said Becky.\n“It is horrid, but I better, Becky; they might hear us, you know,” and he shouted again.\nThe “might” was even a chillier horror than the ghostly laughter, it so confessed a perishing hope. The children stood still and listened; but there was no result. Tom turned upon the back track at once, and hurried his steps. It was but a little while before a certain indecision in his manner revealed another fearful fact to Becky—he could not find his way back!\n“Oh, Tom, you didn’t make any marks!”\n“Becky, I was such a fool! Such a fool! I never thought we might want to come back! No—I can’t find the way. It’s all mixed up.”\n“Tom, Tom, we’re lost! we’re lost! We never can get out of this awful place! Oh, why did we ever leave the others!”\nShe sank to the ground and burst into such a frenzy of crying that Tom was appalled with the idea that she might die, or lose her reason. He sat down by her and put his arms around her; she buried her face in his bosom, she clung to him, she poured out her terrors, her unavailing regrets, and the far echoes turned them all to jeering laughter. Tom begged her to pluck up hope again, and she said she could not. He fell to blaming and abusing himself for getting her into this miserable situation; this had a better effect. She said she would try to hope again, she would get up and follow wherever he might lead if only he would not talk like that any more. For he was no more to blame than she, she said.",

They started again, presently, wandering along the almost endless corridors, getting farther and farther lost all the time. Close upon the hour of noon the whole party congregated at the cavern's mouth and the roll-call was called. The tale was soon told: the two children were missing! Instantly the search was set afoot. But the cave was large and its labyrinthine windings were many, and furnished no signs to guide the searchers.

The third day the search was continued still; but hope began to fail, and the talk was all of how long one could live in a cavern without food. That night the saddest gloom settled down upon the village: the lost were mourned as dead, and many an anxious thought was given to the living who were still bravely groping in the cold dark of the cavern.

They got hungry, and ate the piece of cake they had brought along; but they were thirsty.

They turned into one at last, and then into another, and another, hoping to strike a known vein. It was all useless. They were in the heart of the maze, and every step took them deeper into its bewildering intricacies. The air grew colder, and a damp, earthy smell filled their nostrils. The silence was profound, broken only by the soft drip of water somewhere in the distance and the sound of their own cautious footsteps. Fear, a cold, creeping dread, began to settle upon them. It was no longer an adventure; it was a terrifying reality. They called out, tentatively at first, then louder, their voices echoing strangely in the vast emptiness, swallowed up without response. \"Tom!\" Becky cried, her voice trembling. \"We're lost, aren't we?\" Tom tried to sound brave, but his voice was thin. \"N-no, not lost. Just... exploring a bit further than we meant to.\" But even as he said it, he knew it was a lie. The passages twisted and turned, sometimes narrow and low, forcing them to stoop, sometimes opening into vast, echoing chambers where their candle seemed a mere pinprick against the overwhelming darkness. They tried to retrace their steps, but the corridors looked different coming back. Which turn had they taken? Had they passed this peculiar rock formation before? Doubt gnawed at them. Their candle was burning down, its flame flickering nervously, casting dancing shadows that seemed to mock their plight. Every new opening offered only more darkness, more unknown paths. The initial excitement of the picnic, the joy of the excursion, seemed a lifetime away. Now there was only the oppressive weight of the cave, the crushing silence, and the growing certainty that they were trapped. They stumbled on, their legs weary, their hearts pounding with a mixture of exhaustion and terror. They called out again, their voices hoarse with desperation, but the cave remained silent, indifferent to their pleas. The hope that someone might hear them, that the search party might stumble upon their path, began to dwindle with every passing minute. They were alone, utterly alone, in the belly of the earth, with no idea which way led to safety or how much longer their light would last. The darkness pressed in, a tangible presence, threatening to extinguish not just their candle, but their very hope."

The novelty of their situation, which had burned so brightly the day before, was beginning to flicker and dim. The island, so vast and mysterious when they first landed, now seemed merely a patch of woods, hot and humid, with no clear path and nothing particularly exciting around the next bend. They pushed through tangled undergrowth, their clothes snagging on thorns, their faces brushed by leaves and spiderwebs. The silence was heavy, broken only by the buzz of insects, the rustle of unseen creatures in the bushes, and the sound of their own weary footsteps. They had explored the immediate vicinity of their camp, found nothing new or remarkable, and now this aimless wandering was the only alternative to sitting idly by the fire, which felt too much like doing nothing at all. The grand plans of piracy and adventure, so vivid in their imaginations, seemed a little less real under the relentless sun and the oppressive sameness of the forest. They kicked at roots, swatted at flies, and exchanged occasional, listless remarks that quickly died away. There was no treasure to hunt, no enemy ship to board, just trees and more trees. The initial thrill of being runaways, of defying the world, was slowly giving way to a dull ache of boredom and a vague sense of unease. What were they supposed to do now? How long would they stay? The questions weren't spoken aloud, but they hung in the air between them, heavy and unanswered. They stumbled upon a small, stagnant pool, its surface covered with green scum, and stared at it for a moment before moving on, finding no interest even in this minor deviation from the endless trees. The island was losing its magic, revealing itself as just a place, and a rather monotonous one at that, when you had nothing specific to do but wander. They longed for something, anything, to break the monotony, a sign, an event, a discovery, but the forest offered only more of itself, stretching out in every direction, indifferent to their presence and their growing restlessness. They were pirates without a ship, adventurers without a quest, just three boys lost in the woods, and the romance of it was rapidly fading."

A long time after this—they could not tell how long—Tom said they must go softly and listen for dripping water—they must find a spring. They found one presently, and Tom said it was time to rest again. Both were cruelly tired, yet Becky said she thought she could go a little farther. She was surprised to hear Tom dissent. She could not understand it. They sat down, and Tom fastened his candle to the wall in front of them with some clay. Thought was soon busy; nothing was said for some time. Then Becky broke the silence:\n“Tom, I am so hungry!”\nTom took something out of his pocket.\n“Do you remember this?” said he.\nBecky almost smiled.\n“It’s our wedding-cake, Tom.”\n“Yes—I wish it was as big as a barrel, for it’s all we’ve got.”\n“I saved it from the picnic for us to dream on, Tom, the way grownup people do with wedding-cake—but it’ll be our—”\nShe dropped the sentence where it was. Tom divided the cake and Becky ate with good appetite, while Tom nibbled at his moiety. There was abundance of cold water to finish the feast with. By-and-by Becky suggested that they move on again. Tom was silent a moment. Then he said:\n“Becky, can you bear it if I tell you something?”\nBecky’s face paled, but she thought she could.\n“Well, then, Becky, we must stay here, where there’s water to drink. That little piece is our last candle!”\nBecky gave loose to tears and wailings. Tom did what he could to comfort her, but with little effect. At length Becky said:\n“Tom!”\n“Well, Becky?”\n“They’ll miss us and hunt for us!”\n“Yes, they will! Certainly they will!”\n“Maybe they’re hunting for us now, Tom.”\n“Why, I reckon maybe they are. I hope they are.”\n“When would they miss us, Tom?”\n“When they get back to the boat, I reckon.”\n“Tom, it might be dark then—would they notice we hadn’t come?”\n“I don’t know. But anyway, your mother would miss you as soon as they got home.”\nA frightened look in Becky’s face brought Tom to his senses and he saw that he had made a blunder.

Becky said she wished she had a whole cake. It seemed ages since they had eaten. They were growing hungry again, when Tom stirred. The remnant of the cake was still in his pocket. They divided it and ate it. It seemed like a crumb—only a mouthful—and it created rather than appeased their hunger. They waited, and waited, for what seemed a long time, and listened. They felt cold, now, and Tom shivered. They huddled together for warmth. Then Tom thought he heard a sound. He raised his head and listened. Presently he said: “Hark!” The children held their breath and listened. They seemed to hear the faint far-off sound of voices. “Singing!” said Tom. “It’s singing!” “It’s awful near!” said Becky. “No, it ain’t,” said Tom, “it’s a good way off yet. Keep still, till I shout.” He shouted. There was a moment of silence, then a faint answer. “It’s them!” said Tom. “They’re coming!

Tom believed it must be Tuesday by this time.\nNow an idea struck him. There were some side passages near at hand. It would be better to explore some of these than bear the weight of the heavy time in idleness. He took a kite-line from his pocket, tied it to a projection, and he and Becky started, Tom in the lead, unwinding the line as he groped along. At the end of twenty steps the corridor ended in a “jumping-off place.” Tom got down on his knees and felt below, and then as far around the corner as he could reach with his hands conveniently; he made an effort to stretch yet a little farther to the right, and at that moment, not twenty yards away, a human hand, holding a candle, appeared from behind a rock! Tom lifted up a glorious shout, and instantly that hand was followed by the body it belonged to—Injun Joe’s! Tom was paralyzed; he could not move. He was vastly gratified the next moment, to see the “Spaniard” take to his heels and get himself out of sight. Tom wondered that Joe had not recognized his voice and come over and killed him for testifying in court. But the echoes must have disguised the voice. Without doubt, that was it, he reasoned. Tom’s fright weakened every muscle in his body. He said to himself that if he had strength enough to get back to the spring he would stay there, and nothing should tempt him to run the risk of meeting Injun Joe again. He was careful to keep from Becky what it was he had seen. He told her he had only shouted “for luck.”",

Tom believed it must be Tuesday now. He thought of the \"blind\" passages, and wished he had courage to explore them. They might lead somewhere. It was better than sitting still. He waited a while, thinking; and then he said he would risk it. He got up, and followed one of the passages for some distance, but all at once it ended, and he had to turn back. He tried another, and found the same result. He tried several others, and they all ended the same way. He wondered what could make such passages. The children rested again; and then Tom tried such another passage, resolving that if it ended in nothing he would give up exploration for good and all. This time he traversed a considerable distance, when the light began to fail. He called to Becky to look out. He moved cautiously a step at a time, and at last he stood upon the brink of a precipice that descended a long way down, for the gloom and the feeble light did not penetrate it. He held his candle aloft and peered as long as he could into the black abyss below. Then he sat down, discouraged, and waited for his courage to come back to him. Presently he got up and approached the brink again. That awful stairway of the cave--that funnel-shaped hole with rings cut in the sides for foot-hold, that Tom had pondered over so often--was down there somewhere, but he could not see it. He sat down again, despondished. He blamed himself for not having had the courage to go on, that time and see. They rested again. Tom thought he would try once more. He thought of a passage near the \"picture\" rock that seemed almost entirely blocked up by fallen stones, and determined to examine it. He said he would go by himself and only shout if he found anything. He told Becky to stay where she was and not move till he came back. He lighted a fresh candle and started. He got into the passage, and crowled along on his hands and knees, pushing the tallow candle ahead of him, and getting his shins bruised and tattered all the time. At last he struck his head against one of the fallen stones, and stopped. He felt around with his hands and dislodged it. It was not fast. He dislodged another. He worked away patiently for as much as half an hour, and at last he cleared a space big enough for him to crawl through. He got in and stood up. The passage was not high, but he could stand up.

MAJOR STRUCTURAL ISSUES:\n- The completion introduces a lengthy dialogue between Tom and Becky that does not appear in the original passage. This invented conversation replaces the original's focus on internal states and actions, significantly altering the structure and tone.\n- The completion omits the original's description of Tom's decision to explore another passage and Becky's specific request for Tom to return to her and stay with her at the end.\n- The completion does not include Tom's action of taking the kite-line and his subsequent exploration, which is a key event in the original.\n\n2. MISSING ELEMENTS:\n- The completion lacks the depiction of Becky's emotional withdrawal and her explicit statement about waiting to die, which is present in the original.\n- There is no mention of Tom's promise to Becky regarding staying with her during her final moments, nor the emotional exchange that accompanies this promise.\n- The completion does not describe Tom's physical actions as he prepares to explore, such as taking the kite-line and moving through the passage on his hands and knees.\n\n3. INACCURATE ELEMENTS:\n- The completion provides an inaccurate sequence of events by focusing on an extended dialogue rather than the original's progression from hunger and despair to Tom's resolve and action.\n- The timing and sense of how long the children have been in the cave is discussed differently, with invented speculation and dialogue not present in the original.\n- The completion attributes repeated lines and emotional outbursts to Becky that do not match the original's portrayal of her state at this point in the narrative.\n- Tom's actions and emotional state are misrepresented, with the completion emphasizing reassurance and repeated promises rather than the original's depiction of his distress and determination."

From the cave came only the same wearisome report: Lonesome, damp, dark; no sign anywhere of Tom and Becky! People still flocked with lanterns to the little cave-mouth yonder, but only for grief, now, not hope. All the township was there, many and many a mile of it; the lanterns glinted from the tops of bushes and trees, and from crags that looked down upon the grand river and the village.

Tom Sawyer was in the skiff that bore Judge Thatcher.\nWhen the cave door was unlocked, a sorrowful sight presented itself in the dim twilight of the place. Injun Joe lay stretched upon the ground, dead, with his face close to the crack of the door, as if his longing eyes had been fixed, to the latest moment, upon the light and the cheer of the free world outside. Tom was touched, for he knew by his own experience how this wretch had suffered. His pity was moved, but nevertheless he felt an abounding sense of relief and security, now, which revealed to him in a degree which he had not fully appreciated before how vast a weight of dread had been lying upon him since the day he lifted his voice against this bloody-minded outcast.\nInjun Joe’s bowie-knife lay close by, its blade broken in two. The great foundation-beam of the door had been chipped and hacked through, with tedious labor; useless labor, too, it was, for the native rock formed a sill outside it, and upon that stubborn material the knife had wrought no effect; the only damage done was to the knife itself. But if there had been no stony obstruction there the labor would have been useless still, for if the beam had been wholly cut away Injun Joe could not have squeezed his body under the door, and he knew it. So he had only hacked that place in order to be doing something—in order to pass the weary time—in order to employ his tortured faculties. Ordinarily one could find half a dozen bits of candle stuck around in the crevices of this vestibule, left there by tourists; but there were none now. The prisoner had searched them out and eaten them. He had also contrived to catch a few bats, and these, also, he had eaten, leaving only their claws. The poor unfortunate had starved to death. In one place, near at hand, a stalagmite had been slowly growing up from the ground for ages, builded by the water-drip from a stalactite overhead. The captive had broken off the stalagmite, and upon the stump had placed a stone, wherein he had scooped a shallow hollow to catch the precious drop that fell once in every three minutes with the dreary regularity of a clock-tick—a dessertspoonful once in four and twenty hours. That drop was falling when the Pyramids were new; when Troy fell; when the foundations of Rome were laid; when Christ was crucified; when the Conqueror created the British empire; when Columbus sailed; when the massacre at Lexington was “news.”\nIt is falling now; it will still be falling when all these things shall have sunk down the afternoon of history, and the twilight of tradition, and been swallowed up in the thick night of oblivion. Has everything a purpose and a mission? Did this drop fall patiently during five thousand years to be ready for this flitting human insect’s need? and has it another important object to accomplish ten thousand years to come? No matter. It is many and many a year since the hapless half-breed scooped out the stone to catch the priceless drops, but to this day the tourist stares longest at that pathetic stone and that slow-dropping water when he comes to see the wonders of McDougal’s cave. Injun Joe’s cup stands first in the list of the cavern’s marvels; even “Aladdin’s Palace” cannot rival it.",

Tom Sawyer was in the skiff that bore Judge Thatcher. When they arrived at the cave’s mouth they saw that the door had been unlocked and a good sized crowd were struggling just inside the entrance. “Poor old chap!” said Judge Thatcher, “his troubles are ended. He will never suffer any more.”\nTom felt a great pity for him, mixed with a measure of awe. He had been more afraid of Injun Joe dead than he had been of him alive. He had been a very real and terrible burden upon his spirit for many a long day. The men moved aside and allowed Tom and the Judge to enter. Injun Joe lay stretched upon the ground, dead, with his face close to the crack of the door, as if his last glance had been out upon the free world. There was a bowie-knife at his side and an old tin cup, blackened with smoke, and a few candle ends. The knife blade was broken in two. The beam which he had tried to cut through was chipped and hacked, but the solid rock sill outside had been too much for him. He had not starved, for there was a dried piece of bat in his pocket and a few candle ends. He had evidently been trying to cut his way out when he died. He had probably been dead two or three days. He had been trying to cut through the beam with his knife, but it was a hopeless task, and he had given it up. He had then tried to dig his way out with his hands, but the rock was too hard. He had then tried to cut his way out with his knife again, but the blade had broken. He had then given up all hope and had lain down to die. He had evidently been suffering greatly, for his face was drawn and haggard. He had probably been delirious at the last, for his eyes were wide open and staring.

Tom Sawyer was in the skiff that bore Judge Thatcher. When they arrived at the cave’s mouth they saw that the door had been unlocked and a good sized crowd were struggling just inside the entrance. “Poor old chap!” said Judge Thatcher, “his troubles are ended. He will never suffer any more.”\nTom felt a great pity for him, mixed with a measure of awe. He had been more afraid of Injun Joe dead than he had been of him alive. He had been a very real and terrible burden upon his spirit for many a long day. The men moved aside and allowed Tom and the Judge to enter. Injun Joe lay stretched upon the ground, dead, with his face close to the crack of the door, as if his last glance had been out upon the free world. There was a bowie-knife at his side and an old tin cup, blackened with smoke, and a few candle ends. The knife blade was broken in two. The beam which he had tried to cut through was chipped and hacked, but the solid rock sill outside had been too much for him. He had not starved, for there was a dried piece of bat in his pocket and a few candle ends. He had evidently been trying to cut his way out when he died. He had probably been dead two or three days. He had been trying to cut through the beam with his knife, but it was a hopeless task, and he had given it up. He had then tried to dig his way out with his hands, but the rock was too hard. He had then tried to cut his way out with his knife again, but the blade had broken. He had then given up all hope and had lain down to die. He had evidently been suffering greatly, for his face was drawn and haggard. He had probably been delirious at the last, for his eyes were wide open and staring. He had probably been thinking of the free world outside, and of the sunshine and the birds and the flowers.

Nobody told me it was you; but I just knowed it must ’a’ ben you, soon as I heard ’bout that whiskey business; and I knowed you hadn’t got the money becuz you’d ’a’ got at me some way or other and told me even if you was mum to everybody else. Tom, something’s always told me we’d never get holt of that swag.”\n“Why, Huck, I never told on that tavern-keeper. You know his tavern was all right the Saturday I went to the picnic. Don’t you remember you was to watch there that night?”\n“Oh yes! Why, it seems ’bout a year ago. It was that very night that I follered Injun Joe to the widder’s.”\n“You followed him?”\n“Yes—but you keep mum. I reckon Injun Joe’s left friends behind him, and I don’t want ’em souring on me and doing me mean tricks. If it hadn’t ben for me he’d be down in Texas now, all right.”\nThen Huck told his entire adventure in confidence to Tom, who had only heard of the Welshman’s part of it before.\n“Well,” said Huck, presently, coming back to the main question, “whoever nipped the whiskey in No. 2, nipped the money, too, I reckon—anyways it’s a goner for us, Tom.”\n“Huck, that money wasn’t ever in No. 2!”\n“What!” Huck searched his comrade’s face keenly. “Tom, have you got on the track of that money again?”\n“Huck, it’s in the cave!”\nHuck’s eyes blazed.\n“Say it again, Tom.”\n“The money’s in the cave!”\n“Tom—honest injun, now—is it fun, or earnest?”\n“Earnest, Huck—just as earnest as ever I was in my life.

Tom Sawyer’s Gang—it sounds splendid, don’t it, Huck?”\n“Well, it just does, Tom. And who’ll we rob?”\n“Oh, most anybody. Waylay people—that’s mostly the way.”\n“And kill them?”\n“No, not always. Hive them in the cave till they raise a ransom.”\n“What’s a ransom?”\n“Money. You make them raise all they can, off’n their friends; and after you’ve kept them a year, if it ain’t raised then you kill them. That’s the general way. Only you don’t kill the women. You shut up the women, but you don’t kill them. They’re always beautiful and rich, and awfully scared. You take their watches and things, but you always take your hat off and talk polite. They ain’t anybody as polite as robbers—you’ll see that in any book. Well, the women get to loving you, and after they’ve been in the cave a week or two weeks they stop crying and after that you couldn’t get them to leave. If you drove them out they’d turn right around and come back. It’s so in all the books.”\n“Why, it’s real bully, Tom. I believe it’s better’n to be a pirate.”\n“Yes, it’s better in some ways, because it’s close to home and circuses and all that.”",

I will if it’s where we can blaze our way to it and not get lost.”\n“Why, we can do that,” said Tom. “Don’t you see, it’s away out in the woods, fifteen mile from here—two mile below the Widow Douglas’s.”\n“Oh!” said Huck, getting his breath. “I thought it was in the cave.”\n“No,” said Tom, “that ain’t the place. That’s too near the village.”\n“Tom, that’s the most splendid news that ever was. It ain’t any trouble to blaze a trail and keep it in mind when you’ve got just one to keep in mind, but when you’ve got forty, it’s awful. And besides, this is away yonder, and nobody’s going to come prowling around.”\n“Now, Huck, we’ll start right away. It’s got to be dark, though—dark as pitch. But we’ll lay low till then.”\nThey spent the afternoon in a state of blissful excitement. They gathered their supplies: a chunk of bacon, a couple of loaves of bread, a small quantity of tobacco, two corn-cob pipes, some matches, and a couple of small bags to carry the treasure in. They also took a long piece of kite-string.\nAbout noon they borrowed a small skiff from an unsuspecting owner and paddled down the river. They passed the Widow Douglas’s, and two miles below it, Tom pointed to a place on the bluff. It was a landslide, and it looked like any other landslide to Huck, but Tom said it was one of his markers.\n“Now,” said Tom, “you see that big tree that’s split down the middle? That’s another marker. And that pile of rocks yonder, that’s another. And right between that tree and that pile of rocks, there’s a little hole. You can’t see it from here, but it’s there. That’s the secret entrance to the cave.”\nHuck looked, but he couldn’t see any hole. Tom grinned.\n“Come on,” he said. “We’ll land here and I’ll show you.”\nThey landed the skiff and climbed up the bluff. Tom led the way, and when they got to the place he had pointed out, he pushed aside some bushes and revealed a small, dark opening in the rock.\n“There!” he said, triumphantly. “What did I tell you?”\nHuck was astonished. The hole was so small and so well hidden that he would never have found it on his own.\n“Tom,” he said, “this is the most wonderful place I ever saw. It’s just like a story-book.”\n“It is,” said Tom. “And it’s going to be our hide-out. This is where we’ll bring the treasure. And this is where we’ll form our gang.”\n“Our gang?” said Huck.\n“Yes,” said Tom. “Tom Sawyer’s Gang. We’ll be robbers. We’ll waylay people and make them stand and deliver. We’ll take their money and their watches and their jewelry. And we’ll have a ransom list. We’ll kidnap people and hold them for ransom.”\n“Will we kill them?” asked Huck, a little nervously.\n“No,” said Tom. “Not unless we have to. We’ll be noble robbers. We’ll be like the robbers in the books. We’ll be chivalrous. If we capture a lady, we won’t harm her. We’ll treat her with respect. We’ll give her anything she wants, except her freedom. And we’ll let her go when her friends pay the ransom.”\n“That sounds splendid,” said Huck. “It’s better than being a pirate.”\n“It is,” said Tom. “And we’ll have a secret sign and a password. And we’ll have a code of honor. We’ll be the most famous gang of robbers in the world.”\n“Who else will be in the gang?” asked Huck.\n“Well,” said Tom, “there’ll be you and me, of course. And we’ll ask Joe Harper and Ben Rogers. They’re the only ones I can think of that are brave enough.”\n“What about the others?” asked Huck.\n“Oh, they’re too chicken-hearted,” said Tom. “They wouldn’t dare.”\n“When will we start?” asked Huck.\n“As soon as we get the treasure,” said Tom. “We’ll bring it here and hide it. And then we’ll start recruiting the gang.”\nThey explored the cave for a while. It was much larger than Huck had expected. There were several passages leading off in different directions. Tom said they would explore them all later. For now, they just wanted to find a good place to hide the treasure.\nThey found a small chamber off the main passage that seemed perfect. It was dry and out of the way. They decided to leave the supplies there for now.\n“Well,” said Tom, “we’d better be getting back. It’ll be dark soon.”\nThey left the cave and made their way back to the skiff. As they paddled back up the river, they talked about their plans. They were both very excited. They were going to be rich and famous. They were going to be robbers. It was the most wonderful adventure they had ever imagined.",

They toiled their way to the farther end of the tunnel, then made their spliced kite-strings fast and moved on. A few steps brought them to the spring, and Tom felt a shudder quiver all through him. He showed Huck the fragment of candle-wick perched on a lump of clay against the wall, and described how he and Becky had watched the flame struggle and expire.\nThe boys began to quiet down to whispers, now, for the stillness and gloom of the place oppressed their spirits. They went on, and presently entered and followed Tom’s other corridor until they reached the “jumping-off place.” The candles revealed the fact that it was not really a precipice, but only a steep clay hill twenty or thirty feet high. Tom whispered:\n“Now I’ll show you something, Huck.”\nHe held his candle aloft and said:\n“Look as far around the corner as you can. Do you see that? There—on the big rock over yonder—done with candle-smoke.”\n“Tom, it’s a cross!”\n“Now where’s your Number Two? ‘under the cross,’ hey? Right yonder’s where I saw Injun Joe poke up his candle, Huck!”\nHuck stared at the mystic sign awhile, and then said with a shaky voice:\n“Tom, less git out of here!”\n“What! and leave the treasure?”\n“Yes—leave it. Injun Joe’s ghost is round about there, certain.”\n“No it ain’t, Huck, no it ain’t. It would ha’nt the place where he died—away out at the mouth of the cave—five mile from here.”\n“No, Tom, it wouldn’t. It would hang round the money. I know the ways of ghosts, and so do you.”\nTom began to fear that Huck was right. Misgivings gathered in his mind. But presently an idea occurred to him—\n“Lookyhere, Huck, what fools we’re making of ourselves! Injun Joe’s ghost ain’t a going to come around where there’s a cross!”\nThe point was well taken.

I reckon we’ll climb down there and have a hunt for that box.”\nTom went first, cutting rude steps in the clay hill as he descended. Huck followed. Four avenues opened out of the small cavern which the great rock stood in. The boys examined three of them with no result. They found a small recess in the one nearest the base of the rock, with a pallet of blankets spread down in it; also an old suspender, some bacon rind, and the well-gnawed bones of two or three fowls. But there was no moneybox. The lads searched and researched this place, but in vain. Tom said:\n“He said under the cross. Well, this comes nearest to being under the cross. It can’t be under the rock itself, because that sets solid on the ground.”\nThey searched everywhere once more, and then sat down discouraged. Huck could suggest nothing. By-and-by Tom said:\n“Lookyhere, Huck, there’s footprints and some candle-grease on the clay about one side of this rock, but not on the other sides. Now, what’s that for? I bet you the money is under the rock. I’m going to dig in the clay.”\n“That ain’t no bad notion, Tom!” said Huck with animation.\nTom’s “real Barlow” was out at once, and he had not dug four inches before he struck wood.\n“Hey, Huck!—you hear that?”\nHuck began to dig and scratch now. Some boards were soon uncovered and removed. They had concealed a natural chasm which led under the rock. Tom got into this and held his candle as far under the rock as he could, but said he could not see to the end of the rift. He proposed to explore. He stooped and passed under; the narrow way descended gradually. He followed its winding course, first to the right, then to the left, Huck at his heels. Tom turned a short curve, by-and-by, and exclaimed:\n“My goodness, Huck, lookyhere!”\nIt was the treasure-box, sure enough, occupying a snug little cavern, along with an empty powder-keg, a couple of guns in leather cases, two or three pairs of old moccasins, a leather belt, and some other rubbish well soaked with the water-drip.",

I reckon we’ll climb down there and have a hunt for that box.”\nTom said, “All right. It’s just the likeliest place in the world. Come along.”\nSo they climbed down the clay hill into the mouth of the secret cavern. They stood awed, for a moment, by the silence and solemnity of the place. Then they struck a match, and Tom got a piece of candle out of his pocket. He lit it, and guttered a little tallow into a crevice and stuck the candle there. The place was cold and damp, and silent as the grave. They had to be careful in going about, for the floor was strewn with loose stones and rubbish. The candle revealed three passages that opened out of the cavern. They chose one at random, and prodded along with the candle, down a long, winding corridor that seemed to have no end. They halted at last, far down in the dismal corridor, and stood listening. Not an echo. So Tom said:\n“Look here, Huck, we’re wasting our time. This ain’t the place. Injun Joe’s hiding place is up yonder, near the cross. Let’s go back.”\nThe other two passages were explored in the same way, with the same result. They were disheartened. Injun Joe’s hiding place was not in any of them. They sat down on a rock, to rest and think. As they sat there, Tom noticed that the clay floor was trodden and worn, and that there were candle-grease spots on the rock. He got up and examined the rock. It was a large, flat rock, and it was loose. He put his shoulder to it and tried to move it, but it was too heavy. He got a stick and pried under it, but it wouldn’t budge. He got his knife and dug into the clay around the edge of the rock. He dug down a few inches, and his knife struck something hard. He dug deeper, and struck wood. He was excited now, and he dug with all his might. Huck joined in, and they soon had a hole big enough to see into. They saw that the wood was a board, and that it was part of a box. They dug away the clay around the box, and found that it was a small, iron-bound box. They lifted it out, and it was heavy. They set it on the rock, and Tom tried to open it, but it was locked. He got his knife and tried to pry it open, but he couldn’t. He got a stone and hammered on the lock, but it wouldn’t break. He was about to give up, when Huck said:\n“Look here, Tom, there’s a keyhole. Maybe there’s a key somewhere.”\nThey searched around, but they couldn’t find a key. Tom was discouraged again. He sat down on the rock, and Huck sat down beside him. They were silent for a long time. Then Tom said:\n“Look here, Huck, I’ve got an idea. Maybe the key is in the box.”\nHe got up and examined the box again. He saw that there was a small hole in the lid, near the lock. He got his knife and poked into the hole, and he felt something hard. He poked again, and he felt something soft. He poked again, and he felt something hard. He poked again, and he felt something soft. He poked again, and he felt something hard. He poked again, and he felt something soft. He poked again, and he felt something hard.

Let’s go back.”\nThe other two passages were explored in the same way, with the same result. They were disheartened. Injun Joe’s hiding place was not in any of them. They sat down on a rock, to rest and think. As they sat there, Tom noticed that the clay floor was trodden and worn, and that there were candle-grease spots on the rock. He got up and examined the rock. It was a large, flat rock, and it was loose. He put his shoulder to it and tried to move it, but it was too heavy. He got a stick and pried under it, but it wouldn’t budge. He got his knife and dug into the clay around the edge of the rock. He dug down a few inches, and his knife struck something hard. He dug deeper, and struck wood. He was excited now, and he dug with all his might. Huck joined in, and they soon had a hole big enough to see into. They saw that the wood was a board, and that it was part of a box. They dug away the clay around the box, and found that it was a small, iron-bound box. They lifted it out, and it was heavy. They set it on the rock, and Tom tried to open it, but it was locked. He got his knife and tried to pry it open, but he couldn’t. He got a stone and hammered on the lock, but it wouldn’t break. He was about to give up, when Huck said:\n“Look here, Tom, there’s a keyhole. Maybe there’s a key somewhere.”\nThey searched around, but they couldn’t find a key. Tom was discouraged again. He sat down on the rock, and Huck sat down beside him. They were silent for a long time. Then Tom said:\n“Look here, Huck, I’ve got an idea. Maybe the key is in the box.”\nHe got up and examined the box again. He saw that there was a small hole in the lid, near the lock. He got his knife and poked into the hole, and he felt something hard. He poked again, and he felt something soft. He poked again, and he felt something hard.

            "prefix-probing": "“Tom, I didn’t think of that. But that’s so. It’s luck for us, that cross is. I reckon we’ll climb down there and have a hunt for that box.” They scrambled down into the dark hole, their hearts thumping with a mixture of fear and excitement. The air was damp and smelled of earth and decay. It was pitch black, and they had to feel their way along the rough, uneven ground. Cobwebs brushed against their faces, and unseen things scurried away in the darkness. “Keep close, Huck,” Tom whispered, his voice a little shaky. “Don’t want to get lost down here.” “I’m right here, Tom. This is spooky.” They moved slowly, their hands trailing along the cold, damp stone walls. The cross mark was somewhere near the entrance, but the hole seemed to extend back under the house. They searched carefully, their fingers probing the ground, feeling for anything that felt like a buried box. Minutes stretched into an eternity. The silence was broken only by their own breathing and the occasional drip of water. “Nothing here, Tom,” Huck said, disappointment creeping into his voice. “Maybe we misunderstood.” “No, Huck, it’s got to be here. He said right under the cross. Keep looking.” They continued their painstaking search, their hopes beginning to dwindle. Just as they were about to give up, Tom’s hand struck something hard and metallic. “Huck! I found it! I think I found it!” Huck scrambled over, his excitement instantly rekindled. Together, they dug frantically with their hands. The object was heavy and resisted their efforts at first, but they persevered. Soon, a corner of a small, iron-bound chest emerged from the dirt. Their eyes widened in the gloom. It was real. The treasure was real. They worked together, grunting and straining, to loosen the box from the earth that held it captive. It was heavier than they expected, solid and promising. Finally, with a last heave, they managed to pry it free. It lay there, a dark, rectangular shape in the oppressive darkness, radiating an aura of mystery and wealth. They knelt beside it, their hands trembling as they reached out to touch the cold metal. The adventure had paid off."

Come along with me, boys, you are keeping everybody waiting. Here—hurry up, trot ahead—I’ll haul the wagon for you. Why, it’s not as light as it might be. Got bricks in it?—or old metal?”\n“Old metal,” said Tom.\n“I judged so; the boys in this town will take more trouble and fool away more time hunting up six bits’ worth of old iron to sell to the foundry than they would to make twice the money at regular work. But that’s human nature—hurry along, hurry along!”\nThe boys wanted to know what the hurry was about.\n“Never mind; you’ll see, when we get to the Widow Douglas’.”\nHuck said with some apprehension—for he was long used to being falsely accused:\n“Mr. Jones, we haven’t been doing nothing.”\nThe Welshman laughed.\n“Well, I don’t know, Huck, my boy. I don’t know about that. Ain’t you and the widow good friends?”\n“Yes. Well, she’s ben good friends to me, anyway.”\n“All right, then. What do you want to be afraid for?”\nThis question was not entirely answered in Huck’s slow mind before he found himself pushed, along with Tom, into Mrs. Douglas’ drawing-room.

The Thatchers were there, the Harpers, the Rogerses, Aunt Polly, Sid, Mary, the minister, the editor, and a great many more, and all dressed in their best. The widow received the boys as heartily as any one could well receive two such looking beings. They were covered with clay and candle-grease. Aunt Polly blushed crimson with humiliation, and frowned and shook her head at Tom. Nobody suffered half as much as the two boys did, however. Mr. Jones said:\n“Tom wasn’t at home, yet, so I gave him up; but I stumbled on him and Huck right at my door, and so I just brought them along in a hurry.”\n“And you did just right,” said the widow. “Come with me, boys.”\nShe took them to a bedchamber and said:\n“Now wash and dress yourselves. Here are two new suits of clothes—shirts, socks, everything complete. They’re Huck’s—no, no thanks, Huck—Mr. Jones bought one and I the other. But they’ll fit both of you. Get into them.

How did you get here?”\n“Huck and me arrived only a little while ago, sir.”\nTheir garments were ragged, their faces dirty, their hair tumbled, and their smooth-combed comrades found it hard to “place” them. Huck said, hesitatingly:\n“May we come in, sir?”\n“Why, come in, yes. Come in, boys. Don’t be afraid. Give these adventurers a hearty welcome, everybody!”\n“No, sir,” cried Tom, stepping quickly forward. “We don’t wish to be adventurers. Our adventures are over. We don’t want to have any more, please.”\n“You don’t want any more adventures? Well, I don’t know that I can blame you, considering what an astonishing kind of an adventure this has been. You don’t mean you want to stop here, my boy? Come to the supper-table!”\nTom looked at Aunt Polly, who nodded her sanction, and he and Huck stepped gratefully in. They were hardly less astonished than the others at the spectacle of so much wealth. They hardly knew what to do, at first. Mr. Jones said:\n“Sit down, my lads. We’ll talk this thing over. Mr. Jones, you will oblige me by removing that bag of coin from the floor and counting it out and”—\n“No, don’t do it, Major!” said Tom, hastily. “Please don’t doing it, sir.”\nHuck mumbled a protest, too.\n“I wish you wouldn’t, Major Jones,” said Tom. “It’s most an awful sight.”\n“Awful sight?

Before the guests could find their tongues, the boys were seized and dragged to the front and they stood there abashed and smiling. They were covered with clay and dirt from their long huddling in the cave; and they were bare-footed and ragged, and their faces and hands were blackened by their adventure. But they were heroes, nevertheless, and their comrades poured about them and applauded. Major Jones put an arm around each boy, and said:\n“Here they are, gentlemen! Find me another pair to match them.”\nHe said it proudly. The guests cried:\n“Hurrah for Tom Sawyer and Huckleberry Finn!”\n“Tom Sawyer, you little rascal, where have you been?” said a lady.\n“Everybody thought you were drowned.”\n“Huck Finn, you dirty little rascal, where have you been!” said the widow Douglas, she being fond of him now, and knowing the taste of him by this time. “Everybody thought you were drowned, too.”\n“By jings, I hain’t been nowhere,” said Huck. “Leastways I hain’t been drowned, marm.”\nTom had come dressed to spend the evening at the Major’s, one of the twelve boys who were expected to tire themselves to death practicing military evolutions. At his Aunt Polly’s request he had solemnly promised to stay at home and keep away from all adventures. So he had staid at home and kept away from all adventures till dinner-time, and then the temptation of the twelve boys overcame him, and he joined the ranks. Major Jones said:\n“Boys, go and get yourselves fixed up. Greet your friends. But don’t tarry. Come right back here.”\nWhen the boys were gone the Major said:\n“Well, Judge Thatcher, what do you think of this?”\n“I think it’s the most astonishing thing I ever heard of. Town, you would better telegraph the news to the St. Louis papers.”\n“It’s long past midnight now.”\n“Never mind about that. Dispatch it at all hazards.”\n“Yes, I will, as soon as I can get a messenger to go up to the telegraph office.”\n“Meantime, Major, let me ask you to do one thing. Let me beg you to keep this news from the public for a few days. I don’t want any excitement around the cave till I’ve had a chance to look into the matter and make arrangements.”\n“All right,” answered the Major. “I will.”\n“How much gold is there, Major?”\n“I don’t know. We haven’t counted it yet. But there’s a good deal, I judge.”\n“And how was it discovered, Major?”\n“Well, I will tell you all about that. You see, Tom Sawyer—”\n“Hold on!” said the Judge. “Let Tom tell us himself. He was the chief actor in the thing.”\n“All right,” said the Major. “Tom, come here. Now, my boy, tell us all about it.”\nTom, all stained and dusty as he was, stepped forward and told his long, interesting story, with many interruptions of glad exclamations and applause. There was nothing left to tell. He had told the whole tale. When he had finished, Major Jones said:\n“Well, I don’t know what you think of it, gentlemen, but",

Judge Thatcher, a man of influence, took a keen interest in the boys' welfare, particularly Tom's, seeing in him a future lawyer or statesman. The money, amounting to over twelve thousand dollars each, was invested for them, ensuring their financial security. Tom, already a local hero for his testimony against Injun Joe, became even more celebrated. Huck, however, found the transition to respectability under the Widow Douglas's roof challenging. He missed his freedom, the barrel, and the easy-going life of an outcast. The clean clothes, regular meals, and schooling felt like a prison. Yet, the Widow was patient and kind, determined to civilize him. The treasure transformed their lives utterly, bringing both unexpected comforts and new, sometimes unwelcome, responsibilities. The village, too, felt the ripple effect of this sudden wealth, adding a touch of excitement and wonder to its quiet existence."

He had had a vague idea that he would like to be rich, but he had never thought of being so rich as this. He had not the slightest notion of what to do with it. However, he was not the only one who was puzzled. The whole village was in a ferment. People talked of nothing else. The boys were heroes, and they were rich. It was a combination that was irresistible. Tom was the envy of every boy, and the admiration of every girl. Huck was the envy of every boy, and the admiration of every girl, too, but he was also a puzzle to them. They could not understand how he could be so rich and yet so ragged and so dirty. He was a living proof that money does not always bring happiness, or at least, not always cleanliness. The Widow Douglas took him in hand, and tried to civilize him, but it was a hard job. He was used to his freedom, and he did not like to be cooped up in a house, or to wear clean clothes, or to eat with a knife and fork. He missed his old life, and he was not happy. Tom, on the other hand, took to his new life like a duck to water. He liked being rich, and he liked being a hero. He liked being the center of attention, and he liked being able to buy whatever he wanted. He was still the same old Tom, but he was a richer Tom, and a more important Tom. He was a boy who had found a treasure, and who had found his place in the world, at least for the time being."

I got to go to school, and wash, and wear clothes, and eat with a knife and fork, and sleep in a bed, and be respectable. It’s awful.”\n\nTom’s eyes lit up. He saw his chance. “Huck, you can be a robber. You can live in a cave. You can have a gun. You can go out nights and rob people.”\n\nHuck stared at him, his eyes wide with sudden, wild hope. “Can I? Tom, can I honest? You ain’t foolin’?”\n\n“No, I ain’t foolin’. You can do all them things. But,” Tom added, a mischievous glint in his eye, “you can’t join my gang unless you’re respectable.”\n\nHuck’s face fell. The light went out of his eyes. He looked utterly crushed.\"\"\"\n```",

Perhaps, some day, if his life is a long one, he may meet the survivors of the little women, and see how they made their way in the world. I hope he may, and that he will find them better women, and happier, than when they were girls in the old house at home.",
