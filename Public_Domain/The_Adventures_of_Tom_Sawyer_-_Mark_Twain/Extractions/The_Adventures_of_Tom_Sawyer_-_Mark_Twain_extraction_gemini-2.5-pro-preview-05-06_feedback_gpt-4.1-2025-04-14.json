See?”\nAunt Polly was vexed to think she had overlooked that bit of circumstantial evidence, and missed a trick. Then she had a new inspiration:\n“Tom, you didn’t have to undo your shirt collar where I sewed it, to pump on your head, did you? Unbutton your jacket!”\nThe trouble vanished out of Tom’s face. He opened his jacket. His shirt collar was securely sewed.\n“Bother! Well, go ’long with you. I’d made sure you’d played hookey and been a-swimming. But I forgive ye, Tom. I reckon you’re a kind of a singed cat, as the saying is—better’n you look. This time.”\nShe was half sorry her sagacity had miscarried, and half glad that Tom had stumbled into obedient conduct for once.\nBut Sidney said:\n“Well, now, if I didn’t think you sewed his collar with white thread, but it’s black.”\n“Why, I did sew it with white! Tom!”\nBut Tom did not wait for the rest. As he went out at the door he said:\n“Siddy, I’ll lick you for that.”",

MISSING ELEMENTS:\n- The completion does not include the progression of Aunt Polly's investigation, such as her physical check of Tom's shirt and her internal reflections on her own cleverness.\n- The passage is missing Tom's attempt to preempt Aunt Polly's suspicions, as well as her reaction to his explanation.\n- The subsequent escalation involving Aunt Polly's new line of questioning about Tom's shirt collar is not present.\n- The final exchange involving Sidney's observation, Aunt Polly's realization, and Tom's response is entirely omitted.\n\n3.

This new interest was a valued novelty in whistling, which he had just acquired from a negro, and he was suffering to practise it undisturbed. It consisted in a peculiar bird-like turn, a sort of liquid warble, produced by touching the tongue to the roof of the mouth at short intervals in the midst of the music—the reader probably remembers how to do it, if he has ever been a boy. Diligence and attention soon gave him the knack of it, and he strode down the street with his mouth full of harmony and his soul full of gratitude.

Ben’s gait was the hop-skip-and-jump—proof enough that his heart was light and his anticipations high. He was eating an apple, and giving a long, melodious whoop, at intervals, followed by a deep-toned ding-dong-dong, ding-dong-dong, for he was personating a steamboat. As he drew near, he slackened speed, took the middle of the street, leaned far over to starboard and rounded to ponderously and with laborious pomp and circumstance—for he was personating the Big Missouri, and considered himself to be drawing nine feet of water. He was boat and captain and engine-bells combined, so he had to imagine himself standing on his own hurricane-deck giving the orders and executing them:\n“Stop her, sir! Ting-a-ling-ling!” The headway ran almost out, and he drew up slowly toward the sidewalk.\n“Ship up to back! Ting-a-ling-ling!” His arms straightened and stiffened down his sides.\n“Set her back on the stabboard! Ting-a-ling-ling! Chow! ch-chow-wow! Chow!” His right hand, mean-time, describing stately circles—for it was representing a forty-foot wheel.\n“Let her go back on the labboard! Ting-a-ling-ling! Chow-ch-chow-chow!” The left hand began to describe circles.\n“Stop the stabboard! Ting-a-ling-ling! Stop the labboard! Come ahead on the stabboard! Stop her! Let your outside turn over slow! Ting-a-ling-ling! Chow-ow-ow! Get out that head-line! lively now! Come—out with your spring-line—what’re you about there! Take a turn round that stump with the bight of it! Stand by that stage, now—let her go! Done with the engines, sir! Ting-a-ling-ling! SH’T! S’H’T! SH’T!” (trying the gauge-cocks).\nTom went on whitewashing—paid no attention to the steamboat. Ben stared a moment and then said: “Hi-Yi! You’re up a stump, ain’t you!”\nNo answer. Tom surveyed his last touch with the eye of an artist, then he gave his brush another gentle sweep and surveyed the result, as before. Ben ranged up alongside of him. Tom’s mouth watered for the apple, but he stuck to his work. Ben said:\n“Hello, old chap, you got to work, hey?”\nTom wheeled suddenly and said:\n“Why, it’s you, Ben! I warn’t noticing.”\n“Say—I’m going in a-swimming, I am. Don’t you wish you could? But of course you’d druther work—wouldn’t you? Course you would!”\nTom contemplated the boy a bit, and said:\n“What do you call work?”\n“Why, ain’t that work?”\nTom resumed his whitewashing, and answered carelessly:\n“Well, maybe it is, and maybe it ain’t. All I know, is, it suits Tom Sawyer.”\n“Oh come, now, you don’t mean to let on that you like it?”\nThe brush continued to move.\n“Like it? Well, I don’t see why I oughtn’t to like it. Does a boy get a chance to whitewash a fence every day?”",

Well, go ’long and play; but mind you get back some time in a week, or I’ll tan you.”\nShe was so overcome by the splendor of his achievement that she took him into the closet and selected a choice apple and delivered it to him, along with an improving lecture upon the added value and flavor a treat took to itself when it came without sin through virtuous effort.

Why don’t you tell me, Mary?—what do you want to be so mean for?”\n“Oh, Tom, you poor thick-headed thing, I’m not teasing you. I wouldn’t do that. You must go and learn it again. Don’t you be discouraged, Tom, you’ll manage it—and if you do, I’ll give you something ever so nice. There, now, that’s a good boy.”\n“All right! What is it, Mary, tell me what it is.”\n“Never you mind, Tom. You know if I say it’s nice, it is nice.”\n“You bet you that’s so, Mary. All right, I’ll tackle it again.”\nAnd he did “tackle it again”—and under the double pressure of curiosity and prospective gain he did it with such spirit that he accomplished a shining success. Mary gave him a brand-new “Barlow” knife worth twelve and a half cents; and the convulsion of delight that swept his system shook him to his foundations. True, the knife would not cut anything, but it was a “sure-enough” Barlow, and there was inconceivable grandeur in that—though where the Western boys ever got the idea that such a weapon could possibly be counterfeited to its injury is an imposing mystery and will always remain so, perhaps.

But Mary removed the towel and said:\n“Now ain’t you ashamed, Tom. You mustn’t be so bad. Water won’t hurt you.”\nTom was a trifle disconcerted. The basin was refilled, and this time he stood over it a little while, gathering resolution; took in a big breath and began. When he entered the kitchen presently, with both eyes shut and groping for the towel with his hands, an honorable testimony of suds and water was dripping from his face. But when he emerged from the towel, he was not yet satisfactory, for the clean territory stopped short at his chin and his jaws, like a mask; below and beyond this line there was a dark expanse of unirrigated soil that spread downward in front and backward around his neck. Mary took him in hand, and when she was done with him he was a man and a brother, without distinction of color, and his saturated hair was neatly brushed, and its short curls wrought into a dainty and symmetrical general effect. [He privately smoothed out the curls, with labor and difficulty, and plastered his hair close down to his head; for he held curls to be effeminate, and his own filled his life with bitterness.] Then Mary got out a suit of his clothing that had been used only on Sundays during two years—they were simply called his “other clothes”—and so by that we know the size of his wardrobe. The girl “put him to rights” after he had dressed himself; she buttoned his neat roundabout up to his chin, turned his vast shirt collar down over his shoulders, brushed him off and crowned him with his speckled straw hat. He now looked exceedingly improved and uncomfortable. He was fully as uncomfortable as he looked; for there was a restraint about whole clothes and cleanliness that galled him. He hoped that Mary would forget his shoes, but the hope was blighted; she coated them thoroughly with tallow, as was the custom, and brought them out. He lost his temper and said he was always being made to do everything he didn’t want to do. But Mary said, persuasively:\n“Please, Tom—that’s a good boy.”\nSo he got into the shoes snarling.

Two of the children always remained for the sermon voluntarily, and the other always remained too—for stronger reasons. The church’s high-backed, uncushioned pews would seat about three hundred persons; the edifice was but a small, plain affair, with a sort of pine board tree-box on top of it for a steeple. At the door Tom dropped back a step and accosted a Sunday-dressed comrade:\n“Say, Billy, got a yaller ticket?”\n“Yes.”\n“What’ll you take for her?”\n“What’ll you give?”\n“Piece of lickrish and a fish-hook.”\n“Less see ’em.”\nTom exhibited. They were satisfactory, and the property changed hands. Then Tom traded a couple of white alleys for three red tickets, and some small trifle or other for a couple of blue ones. He waylaid other boys as they came, and went on buying tickets of various colors ten or fifteen minutes longer. He entered the church, now, with a swarm of clean and noisy boys and girls, proceeded to his seat and started a quarrel with the first boy that came handy. The teacher, a grave, elderly man, interfered; then turned his back a moment and Tom pulled a boy’s hair in the next bench, and was absorbed in his book when the boy turned around; stuck a pin in another boy, presently, in order to hear him say “Ouch!” and got a new reprimand from his teacher. Tom’s whole class were of a pattern—restless, noisy, and troublesome. When they came to recite their lessons, not one of them knew his verses perfectly, but had to be prompted all along. However, they worried through, and each got his reward—in small blue tickets, each with a passage of Scripture on it; each blue ticket was pay for two verses of the recitation. Ten blue tickets equalled a red one, and could be exchanged for it; ten red tickets equalled a yellow one; for ten yellow tickets the superintendent gave a very plainly bound Bible (worth forty cents in those easy times) to the pupil. How many of my readers would have the industry and application to memorize two thousand verses, even for a Doré Bible? And yet Mary had acquired two Bibles in this way—it was the patient work of two years—and a boy of German parentage had won four or five. He once recited three thousand verses without stopping; but the strain upon his mental faculties was too great, and he was little better than an idiot from that day forth—a grievous misfortune for the school, for on great occasions, before company, the superintendent (as Tom expressed it) had always made this boy come out and “spread himself.” Only the older pupils managed to keep their tickets and stick to their tedious work long enough to get a Bible, and so the delivery of one of these prizes was a rare and noteworthy circumstance; the successful pupil was so great and conspicuous for that day that on the spot every scholar’s heart was fired with a fresh ambition that often lasted a couple of weeks. It is possible that Tom’s mental stomach had never really hungered for one of those prizes, but unquestionably his entire being had for many a day longed for the glory and the eclat that came with it.",

          "text_segment": "In due course the superintendent stood up in front of the pulpit, with a closed hymn-book in his hand and his forefinger inserted between its leaves, and commanded attention. When a Sunday-school superintendent makes his customary little speech, a hymn-book in the hand is as necessary as is the inevitable sheet of music in the hand of a singer who stands forward on the platform and sings a solo at a concert—though why, is a mystery: for neither the hymn-book nor the sheet of music is ever referred to by the sufferer. This superintendent was a slim creature of thirty-five, with a sandy goatee and short sandy hair; he wore a stiff standing-collar whose upper edge almost reached his ears and whose sharp points curved forward abreast the corners of his mouth—a fence that compelled a straight lookout ahead, and a turning of the whole body when a side view was required; his chin was propped on a spreading cravat which was as broad and as long as a bank-note, and had fringed ends; his boot toes were turned sharply up, in the fashion of the day, like sleigh-runners—an effect patiently and laboriously produced by the young men by sitting with their toes pressed against a wall for hours together. Mr. Walters was very earnest of mien, and very sincere and honest at heart; and he held sacred things and places in such reverence, and so separated them from worldly matters, that unconsciously to himself his Sunday-school voice had acquired a peculiar intonation which was wholly absent on week-days. He began after this fashion:\n“Now, children, I want you all to sit up just as straight and pretty as you can and give me all your attention for a minute or two. There—that is it. That is the way good little boys and girls should do. I see one little girl who is looking out of the window—I am afraid she thinks I am out there somewhere—perhaps up in one of the trees making a speech to the little birds. [Applausive titter.] I want to tell you how good it makes me feel to see so many bright, clean little faces assembled in a place like this, learning to do right and be good.” And so forth and so on. It is not necessary to set down the rest of the oration. It was of a pattern which does not vary, and so it is familiar to us all.\nThe latter third of the speech was marred by the resumption of fights and other recreations among certain of the bad boys, and by fidgetings and whisperings that extended far and wide, washing even to the bases of isolated and incorruptible rocks like Sid and Mary. But now every sound ceased suddenly, with the subsidence of Mr. Walters’ voice, and the conclusion of the speech was received with a burst of silent gratitude.\nA good part of the whispering had been occasioned by an event which was more or less rare—the entrance of visitors: lawyer Thatcher, accompanied by a very feeble and aged man; a fine, portly, middle-aged gentleman with iron-gray hair; and a dignified lady who was doubtless the latter’s wife. The lady was leading a child. Tom had been restless and full of chafings and repinings; conscience-smitten, too—he could not meet Amy Lawrence’s eye, he could not brook her loving gaze. But when he saw this small newcomer his soul was all ablaze with bliss in a moment. The next moment he was “showing off” with all his might—cuffing boys, pulling hair, making faces—in a word, using every art that seemed likely to fascinate a girl and win her applause. His exaltation had but one alloy—the memory of his humiliation in this angel’s garden—and that record in sand was fast washing out, under the waves of happiness that were sweeping over it now.",

He held his hymn-book by the middle of the back, between the thumb and forefinger of his right hand—it was the orthodox way. He adopted a peculiar style of speech, a sort of sermonizing, and when he spoke he never moved his head, but stood straight up, with his back stiff, and his chin in a lofty position, and his voice flowing on in a monotonous tone. He began a long speech, in which he told the children how good they had been, and how much he loved them, and what a credit they were to the village. He told them that the eyes of the world were upon them, and that they ought to be careful to walk in the right path. Then he told them a story about a little boy who had been naughty and had run away from home, and had been eaten by a lion. The children were very much interested in this story, and when he had finished it they were all very quiet. But just then the door opened and a gentleman and a lady and a little girl came in.

He was from Constantinople, twelve miles away—so he had travelled, and seen the world—these very eyes had looked upon the county court-house—which was said to have a tin roof.

That is what you will say, Thomas—and you wouldn’t take any money for those two thousand verses—no indeed you wouldn’t. And now you wouldn’t mind telling me and this lady some of the things you’ve learned—no, I know you wouldn’t—for we are proud of little boys that learn. Now, no doubt you know the names of all the twelve disciples. Won’t you tell us the names of the first two that were appointed?”\nTom was tugging at a button-hole and looking sheepish. He blushed, now, and his eyes fell. Mr. Walters’ heart sank within him. He said to himself, it is not possible that the boy can answer the simplest question—why did the Judge ask him?

His voice began on a medium key and climbed steadily up till it reached a certain point, where it bore with strong emphasis upon the topmost word and then plunged down as if from a spring-board:\nShall I be car-ri-ed toe the skies, on flow’ry beds\nof ease,\nWhilst others fight to win the prize, and sail thro’ blood\n-y seas?\nHe was regarded as a wonderful reader. At church “sociables” he was always called upon to read poetry; and when he was through, the ladies would lift up their hands and let them fall helplessly in their laps, and “wall” their eyes, and shake their heads, as much as to say, “Words cannot express it; it is too beautiful, TOO beautiful for this mortal earth.”\nAfter the hymn had been sung, the Rev.

Amen.\nThere was a rustling of dresses, and the standing congregation sat down. The boy whose history this book relates did not enjoy the prayer, he only endured it—if he even did that much. He was restive all through it; he kept tally of the details of the prayer, unconsciously—for he was not listening, but he knew the ground of old, and the clergyman’s regular route over it—and when a little trifle of new matter was interlarded, his ear detected it and his whole nature resented it; he considered additions unfair, and scoundrelly. In the midst of the prayer a fly had lit on the back of the pew in front of him and tortured his spirit by calmly rubbing its hands together, embracing its head with its arms, and polishing it so vigorously that it seemed to almost part company with the body, and the slender thread of a neck was exposed to view; scraping its wings with its hind legs and smoothing them to its body as if they had been coat-tails; going through its whole toilet as tranquilly as if it knew it was perfectly safe. As indeed it was; for as sorely as Tom’s hands itched to grab for it they did not dare—he believed his soul would be instantly destroyed if he did such a thing while the prayer was going on. But with the closing sentence his hand began to curve and steal forward; and the instant the “Amen” was out the fly was a prisoner of war. His aunt detected the act and made him let it go.",

It was a large black beetle with formidable jaws—a “pinchbug,” he called it. It was in a percussion-cap box. The first thing the beetle did was to take him by the finger. A natural fillip followed, the beetle went floundering into the aisle and lit on its back, and the hurt finger went into the boy’s mouth. The beetle lay there working its helpless legs, unable to turn over. Tom eyed it, and longed for it; but it was safe out of his reach. Other people uninterested in the sermon found relief in the beetle, and they eyed it too. Presently a vagrant poodle dog came idling along, sad at heart, lazy with the summer softness and the quiet, weary of captivity, sighing for change. He spied the beetle; the drooping tail lifted and wagged. He surveyed the prize; walked around it; smelt at it from a safe distance; walked around it again; grew bolder, and took a closer smell; then lifted his lip and made a gingerly snatch at it, just missing it; made another, and another; began to enjoy the diversion; subsided to his stomach with the beetle between his paws, and continued his experiments; grew weary at last, and then indifferent and absent-minded. His head nodded, and little by little his chin descended and touched the enemy, who seized it. There was a sharp yelp, a flirt of the poodle’s head, and the beetle fell a couple of yards away, and lit on its back once more. The neighboring spectators shook with a gentle inward joy, several faces went behind fans and hand-kerchiefs, and Tom was entirely happy. The dog looked foolish, and probably felt so; but there was resentment in his heart, too, and a craving for revenge. So he went to the beetle and began a wary attack on it again; jumping at it from every point of a circle, lighting with his fore-paws within an inch of the creature, making even closer snatches at it with his teeth, and jerking his head till his ears flapped again. But he grew tired once more, after a while; tried to amuse himself with a fly but found no relief; followed an ant around, with his nose close to the floor, and quickly wearied of that; yawned, sighed, forgot the beetle entirely, and sat down on it. Then there was a wild yelp of agony and the poodle went sailing up the aisle; the yelps continued, and so did the dog; he crossed the house in front of the altar; he flew down the other aisle; he crossed before the doors; he clamored up the home-stretch; his anguish grew with his progress, till presently he was but a woolly comet moving in its orbit with the gleam and the speed of light. At last the frantic sufferer sheered from its course, and sprang into its master’s lap; he flung it out of the window, and the voice of distress quickly thinned away and died in the distance.",

Where’d you get him?”\n“Bought him off’n a boy.”\n“What did you give?”\n“I give a blue ticket and a bladder that I got at the slaughter-house.”\n“Where’d you get the blue ticket?”\n“Bought it off’n Ben Rogers two weeks ago for a hoop-stick.”\n“Say—what is dead cats good for, Huck?”\n“Good for? Cure warts with.”\n“No! Is that so? I know something that’s better.”\n“I bet you don’t. What is it?”\n“Why, spunk-water.”\n“Spunk-water! I wouldn’t give a dern for spunk-water.”\n“You wouldn’t, wouldn’t you? D’you ever try it?”\n“No, I hain’t. But Bob Tanner did.”\n“Who told you so!”\n“Why, he told Jeff Thatcher, and Jeff told Johnny Baker, and Johnny told Jim Hollis, and Jim told Ben Rogers, and Ben told a nigger, and the nigger told me. There now!”\n“Well, what of it? They’ll all lie. Leastways all but the nigger. I don’t know him. But I never see a nigger that wouldn’t lie. Shucks! Now you tell me how Bob Tanner done it, Huck.”\n“Why, he took and dipped his hand in a rotten stump where the rain-water was.”\n“In the daytime?”\n“Certainly.”\n“With his face to the stump?”\n“Yes. Least I reckon so.”\n“Did he say anything?”\n“I don’t reckon he did. I don’t know.”\n“Aha! Talk about trying to cure warts with spunk-water such a blame fool way as that! Why, that ain’t a-going to do any good. You got to go all by yourself, to the middle of the woods, where you know there’s a spunk-water stump, and just as it’s midnight you back up against the stump and jam your hand in and say:\n‘Barley-corn, barley-corn, injun-meal shorts,\nSpunk-water, spunk-water, swaller these warts,’\nand then walk away quick, eleven steps, with your eyes shut, and then turn around three times and walk home without speaking to anybody. Because if you speak the charm’s busted.”\n“Well, that sounds like a good way; but that ain’t the way Bob Tanner done.”\n“No, sir, you can bet he didn’t, becuz he’s the wartiest boy in this town; and he wouldn’t have a wart on him if he’d knowed how to work spunk-water. I’ve took off thousands of warts off of my hands that way, Huck. I play with frogs so much that I’ve always got considerable many warts. Sometimes I take ’em off with a bean.”\n“Yes, bean’s good. I’ve done that.”\n“Have you? What’s your way?”\n“You take and split the bean, and cut the wart so as to get some blood, and then you put the blood on one piece of the bean and take and dig a hole and bury it ’bout midnight at the crossroads in the dark of the moon, and then you burn up the rest of the bean. You see that piece that’s got the blood on it will keep drawing and drawing, trying to fetch the other piece to it, and so that helps the blood to draw the wart, and pretty soon off she comes.”\n“Yes, that’s it, Huck—that’s it; though when you’re burying it if you say ‘Down bean; off wart; come no more to bother me!’ it’s better. That’s the way Joe Harper does, and he’s been nearly to Coonville and most everywheres. But say—how do you cure ’em with dead cats?”\n“Why, you take your cat and go and get in the grave-yard ’long about midnight when somebody that was wicked has been buried; and when it’s midnight a devil will come, or maybe two or three, but you can’t see ’em, you can only hear something like the wind, or maybe hear ’em talk; and when they’re taking that feller away, you heave your cat after ’em and say, ‘Devil follow corpse, cat follow devil, warts follow cat, I’m done with ye!’ That’ll fetch any wart.”\n“Sounds right. D’you ever try it, Huck?”\n“No, but old Mother Hopkins told me.”\n“Well, I reckon it’s so, then. Becuz they say she’s a witch.”\n“Say! Why, Tom, I know she is. She witched pap. Pap says so his own self. He come along one day, and he see she was a-witching him, so he took up a rock, and if she hadn’t dodged, he’d a got her. Well, that very night he rolled off’n a shed wher’ he was a layin drunk, and broke his arm.”\n“Why, that’s awful. How did he know she was a-witching him?”\n“Lord, pap can tell, easy. Pap says when they keep looking at you right stiddy, they’re a-witching you. Specially if they mumble. Becuz when they mumble they’re saying the Lord’s Prayer backards.”\n“Say, Hucky, when you going to try the cat?”\n“To-night. I reckon they’ll come after old Hoss Williams to-night.”\n“But they buried him Saturday. Didn’t they get him Saturday night?”\n“Why, how you talk! How could their charms work till midnight?—and then it’s Sunday. Devils don’t slosh around much of a Sunday, I don’t reckon.”\n“I never thought of that. That’s so. Lemme go with you?”\n“Of course—if you ain’t afeard.”\n“Afeard! ’Tain’t likely. Will you meow?”\n“Yes—and you meow back, if you get a chance. Last time, you kep’ me a-meowing around till old Hays went to throwing rocks at me and says ‘Dern that cat!’ and so I hove a brick through his window—but don’t you tell.”\n“I won’t.

It’s a mighty small tick, anyway.”\n“Oh, anybody can run a tick down that don’t belong to them. I’m satisfied with it. It’s a good enough tick for me.”\n“Sho, there’s ticks a plenty. I could have a thousand of ’em if I wanted to.”\n“Well, why don’t you? Becuz you know mighty well you can’t. This is a pretty early tick, I reckon. It’s the first one I’ve seen this year.”\n“Say, Huck—I’ll give you my tooth for him.”\n“Less see it.”\nTom got out a bit of paper and carefully unrolled it. Huckleberry viewed it wistfully. The temptation was very strong. At last he said:\n“Is it genuwyne?”\nTom lifted his lip and showed the vacancy.\n“Well, all right,” said Huckleberry, “it’s a trade.”\nTom enclosed the tick in the percussion-cap box that had lately been the pinchbug’s prison, and the boys separated, each feeling wealthier than before.",

Take off your jacket.”\n\nThe master’s arm performed until it was tired and the stock of switches was notably diminished. Then the order followed:\n\n“Now, sir, go and sit with the girls! And let this be a warning to you.”\n\nThe titter that rippled around the room appeared to abash the boy, but in reality that result was caused rather by his worshipful awe of his unknown idol and the dread pleasure that lay in his high good fortune. He sat down upon the end of the pine bench and the girl hitched herself away from him with a toss of her head. Nudges and winks and whispers traversed the room, but Tom sat still, with his arms upon the long, low desk before him, and seemed to study his book.\n\nBy and by attention ceased from him, and the accustomed school murmur rose upon the dull air once more. Presently the boy began to steal furtive glances at the girl. She observed it, “made a mouth” at him and gave him the back of her head for the space of a minute. When she cautiously faced around again, a peach lay before her. She thrust it away. Tom gently put it back. She thrust it away again, but with less animosity. Tom patiently returned it to its place. Then she let it remain. Tom scrawled on his slate, “Please take it—I got more.” The girl glanced at the words, but made no sign. Now the boy began to draw something on the slate, hiding his work with his left hand. For a time the girl refused to notice; but her human curiosity presently began to manifest itself by hardly perceptible signs. The boy worked on, apparently unconscious. The girl made a sort of non-committal attempt to see, but the boy did not betray that he was aware of it. At last she gave in and hesitatingly whispered:\n\n“Let me see it.”\n\nTom partly uncovered a dismal caricature of a house with two gable ends to it and a corkscrew of smoke issuing from the chimney. Then the girl’s interest began to fasten itself upon the work and she forgot everything else. When it was finished, she gazed a moment, then whispered:\n\n“It’s nice—make a man.”\n\nThe artist erected a man in the front yard, that resembled a derrick.

The drowsing murmur of the five and twenty studying scholars soothed the soul like the spell that is in the murmur of bees. Away off in the flaming sunshine, Cardiff Hill lifted its soft green sides through a shimmering veil of heat, tinted with the purple of distance; a few birds floated on lazy wing high in the air; no other living thing was visible but some cows, and they were asleep. Tom’s heart ached to be free, or else to have something of interest to do to pass the dreary time. His hand wandered into his pocket and his face lit up with a glow of gratitude that was prayer, though he did not know it. Then furtively the percussion-cap box came out. He released the tick and put him on the long flat desk. The creature probably glowed with a gratitude that amounted to prayer, too, at this moment, but it was premature: for when he started thankfully to travel off, Tom turned him aside with a pin and made him take a new direction.",

When the interest in art began to wane, the two fell to talking. Tom was swimming in bliss. He said:\n“Do you love rats?”\n“No! I hate them!”\n“Well, I do, too—live ones. But I mean dead ones, to swing round your head with a string.”\n“No, I don’t care for rats much, anyway. What I like is chewing-gum.”\n“Oh, I should say so! I wish I had some now.”\n“Do you? I’ve got some. I’ll let you chew it awhile, but you must give it back to me.”\nThat was agreeable, so they chewed it turn about, and dangled their legs against the bench in excess of contentment.\n“Was you ever at a circus?” said Tom.\n“Yes, and my pa’s going to take me again some time, if I’m good.”\n“I been to the circus three or four times—lots of times. Church ain’t shucks to a circus. There’s things going on at a circus all the time. I’m going to be a clown in a circus when I grow up.”\n“Oh, are you! That will be nice. They’re so lovely, all spotted up.”\n“Yes, that’s so. And they get slathers of money—most a dollar a day, Ben Rogers says. Say, Becky, was you ever engaged?”\n“What’s that?”\n“Why, engaged to be married.”\n“No.”\n“Would you like to?”\n“I reckon so. I don’t know. What is it like?”\n“Like? Why it ain’t like anything. You only just tell a boy you won’t ever have anybody but him, ever ever ever, and then you kiss and that’s all. Anybody can do it.”",

Please, Becky.” And he tugged at her apron and the hands.\nBy and by she gave up, and let her hands drop; her face, all glowing with the struggle, came up and submitted.

And always coming to school or when we’re going home, you’re to walk with me, when there ain’t anybody looking—and you choose me and I choose you at parties, because that’s the way you do when you’re engaged.”\n“It’s so nice.

He crossed a small “branch” two or three times, because of a prevailing juvenile superstition that to cross water baffled pursuit. Half an hour later he was disappearing behind the Douglas mansion on the summit of Cardiff Hill, and the school-house was hardly distinguishable away off in the valley behind him. He entered a dense wood, picked his pathless way to the centre of it, and sat down on a mossy spot under a spreading oak. There was not even a zephyr stirring; the dead noonday heat had even stilled the songs of the birds; nature lay in a trance that was broken by no sound but the occasional far-off hammering of a wood-pecker, and this seemed to render the pervading silence and sense of loneliness the more profound. The boy’s soul was steeped in melancholy; his feelings were in happy accord with his surroundings. He sat long with his elbows on his knees and his chin in his hands, meditating. It seemed to him that life was but a trouble, at best, and he more than half envied Jimmy Hodges, so lately released; it must be very peaceful, he thought, to lie and slumber and dream forever and ever, with the wind whispering through the trees and caressing the grass and the flowers over the grave, and nothing to bother and grieve about, ever any more. If he only had a clean Sunday-school record he could be willing to go, and be done with it all. Now as to this girl. What had he done? Nothing. He had meant the best in the world, and been treated like a dog—like a very dog. She would be sorry some day—maybe when it was too late. Ah, if he could only die temporarily!",

No—better still, he would join the Indians, and hunt buffaloes and go on the warpath in the mountain ranges and the trackless great plains of the Far West, and away in the future come back a great chief, bristling with feathers, hideous with paint, and prance into Sunday-school, some drowsy summer morning, with a blood-curdling war-whoop, and sear the eyeballs of all his companions with unappeasable envy.

In it lay a marble. Tom’s astonishment was boundless! He scratched his head with a perplexed air, and said:\n“Well, that beats anything!”\nThen he tossed the marble away pettishly, and stood cogitating. The truth was, that a superstition of his had failed, here, which he and all his comrades had always looked upon as infallible. If you buried a marble with certain necessary incantations, and left it alone a fortnight, and then opened the place with the incantation he had just used, you would find that all the marbles you had ever lost had gathered themselves together there, meantime, no matter how widely they had been separated. But now, this thing had actually and unquestionably failed. Tom’s whole structure of faith was shaken to its foundations. He had many a time heard of this thing succeeding but never of its failing before. It did not occur to him that he had tried it several times before, himself, but could never find the hiding-places afterward. He puzzled over the matter some time, and finally decided that some witch had interfered and broken the charm. He thought he would satisfy himself on that point; so he searched around till he found a small sandy spot with a little funnel-shaped depression in it. He laid himself down and put his mouth close to this depression and called—\n“Doodle-bug, doodle-bug, tell me what I want to know! Doodle-bug, doodle-bug, tell me what I want to know!”\nThe sand began to work, and presently a small black bug appeared for a second and then darted under again in a fright.\n“He dasn’t tell!

            "They put down their other playthings, adopted fencing stances, and commenced a serious and deliberate sword fight with their wooden lath swords, following a pattern of 'two up and two down' moves.",

            "They reached a compromise: Joe could play the role of Friar Tuck or Much the Miller's son and engage Tom with a quarter-staff, or alternatively, Tom would portray the Sheriff of Nottingham, allowing Joe, as Robin Hood, to defeat him.",
            "These agreed-upon adventures were then acted out by the boys.",

He said cautiously—to an imaginary company:\n“Hold, my merry men! Keep hid till I blow.”\nNow appeared Joe Harper, as airily clad and elaborately armed as Tom. Tom called:\n“Hold! Who comes here into Sherwood Forest without my pass?”\n“Guy of Guisborne wants no man’s pass. Who art thou that—that—”\n“Dares to hold such language,” said Tom, prompting—for they talked “by the book,” from memory.\n“Who art thou that dares to hold such language?”\n“I, indeed! I am Robin Hood, as thy caitiff carcase soon shall know.”\n“Then art thou indeed that famous outlaw? Right gladly will I dispute with thee the passes of the merry wood. Have at thee!”\nThey took their lath swords, dumped their other traps on the ground, struck a fencing attitude, foot to foot, and began a grave, careful combat, “two up and two down.” Presently Tom said:\n“Now, if you’ve got the hang, go it lively!”\nSo they “went it lively,” panting and perspiring with the work. By and by Tom shouted:\n“Fall! fall! Why don’t you fall?”\n“I sha’n’t! Why don’t you fall yourself? You’re getting the worst of it.”\n“Why, that ain’t anything. I can’t fall; that ain’t the way it is in the book. The book says, ‘Then with one back-handed stroke he slew poor Guy of Guisborne.’ You’re to turn around and let me hit you in the back.”\nThere was no getting around the authorities, so Joe turned, received the whack and fell.\n“Now,” said Joe, getting up, “you got to let me kill you. That’s fair.”\n“Why, I can’t do that, it ain’t in the book.”\n“Well, it’s blamed mean—that’s all.”\n“Well, say, Joe, you can be Friar Tuck or Much the miller’s son, and lam me with a quarter-staff; or I’ll be the Sheriff of Nottingham and you be Robin Hood a little while and kill me.”\nThis was satisfactory, and so these adventures were carried out. Then Tom became Robin Hood again, and was allowed by the treacherous nun to bleed his strength away through his neglected wound. And at last Joe, representing a whole tribe of weeping outlaws, dragged him sadly forth, gave his bow into his feeble hands, and Tom said, “Where this arrow falls, there bury poor Robin Hood under the greenwood tree.” Then he shot the arrow and fell back and would have died, but he lit on a nettle and sprang up too gaily for a corpse.",

So he lay still, and stared up into the dark. Everything was dismally still. By and by, out of the stillness, little, scarcely perceptible noises began to emphasize themselves. The ticking of the clock began to bring itself into notice. Old beams began to crack mysteriously. The stairs creaked faintly. Evidently spirits were abroad. A measured, muffled snore issued from Aunt Polly’s chamber. And now the tiresome chirping of a cricket that no human ingenuity could locate, began. Next the ghastly ticking of a death-watch in the wall at the bed’s head made Tom shudder—it meant that somebody’s days were numbered. Then the howl of a far-off dog rose on the night air, and was answered by a fainter howl from a remoter distance. Tom was in an agony. At last he was satisfied that time had ceased and eternity begun; he began to doze, in spite of himself; the clock chimed eleven, but he did not hear it. And then there came, mingling with his half-formed dreams, a most melancholy caterwauling. The raising of a neighboring window disturbed him. A cry of “Scat! you devil!” and the crash of an empty bottle against the back of his aunt’s woodshed brought him wide awake, and a single minute later he was dressed and out of the window and creeping along the roof of the “ell” on all fours. He “meow’d” with caution once or twice, as he went; then jumped to the roof of the woodshed and thence to the ground. Huckleberry Finn was there, with his dead cat. The boys moved off and disappeared in the gloom. At the end of half an hour they were wading through the tall grass of the graveyard.",

But I never meant any harm. Everybody calls him Hoss.”\n“A body can’t be too partic’lar how they talk ’bout these-yer dead people, Tom.”\nThis was a damper, and conversation died again.\nPresently Tom seized his comrade’s arm and said:\n“Sh!”\n“What is it, Tom?” And the two clung together with beating hearts.\n“Sh! There ’tis again! Didn’t you hear it?”\n“I—”\n“There! Now you hear it.”\n“Lord, Tom, they’re coming! They’re coming, sure. What’ll we do?”\n“I dono.

If we keep perfectly still, maybe they won’t notice us at all.”\n“I’ll try to, Tom, but, Lord, I’m all of a shiver.”\n“Listen!”\nThe boys bent their heads together and scarcely breathed. A muffled sound of voices floated up from the far end of the graveyard.\n“Look! See there!” whispered Tom. “What is it?”\n“It’s devil-fire. Oh, Tom, this is awful.”\nSome vague figures approached through the gloom, swinging an old-fashioned tin lantern that freckled the ground with innumerable little spangles of light. Presently Huckleberry whispered with a shudder:\n“It’s the devils sure enough. Three of ’em! Lordy, Tom, we’re goners! Can you pray?”\n“I’ll try, but don’t you be afeard. They ain’t going to hurt us. ‘Now I lay me down to sleep, I—’”\n“Sh!”\n“What is it, Huck?”\n“They’re humans! One of ’em is, anyway. One of ’em’s old Muff Potter’s voice.”\n“No—’tain’t so, is it?”\n“I bet I know it. Don’t you stir nor budge. He ain’t sharp enough to notice us. Drunk, the same as usual, likely—blamed old rip!”\n“All right, I’ll keep still. Now they’re stuck. Can’t find it. Here they come again. Now they’re hot. Cold again. Hot again. Red hot!

MISSING ELEMENTS:\n- The completion is missing the description of the \"dismal ceremonies and incantations\" that accompany the burial of the shingle. This ritualistic aspect is important for conveying the mood and significance of the boys' actions.\n- The final symbolic gesture regarding the secrecy of their oath (the metaphor about the fetters and the key) is not included, which lessens the sense of finality and gravity.\n- The appearance of a new character or figure at the end of the passage is not mentioned, omitting a key narrative development and sense of suspense.\n\n3.

Pap used to sleep there, sometimes, ’long with the hogs, but laws bless you, he just lifts things when he snores. Besides, I reckon he ain’t ever coming back to this town any more.”\nThe spirit of adventure rose in the boys’ souls once more.\n“Hucky, do you das’t to go if I lead?”\n“I don’t like to, much. Tom, s’pose it’s Injun Joe!”\nTom quailed. But presently the temptation rose up strong again and the boys agreed to try, with the understanding that they would take to their heels if the snoring stopped. So they went tiptoeing stealthily down, the one behind the other. When they had got to within five steps of the snorer, Tom stepped on a stick, and it broke with a sharp snap. The man moaned, writhed a little, and his face came into the moonlight. It was Muff Potter. The boys’ hearts had stood still, and their hopes too, when the man moved, but their fears passed away now. They tip-toed out, through the broken weather-boarding, and stopped at a little distance to exchange a parting word.",

This results in the absence of the main sequence where the boys discuss the snoring, debate their next actions, and approach the source of the noise.\n\n2. MISSING ELEMENTS:\n- The completion lacks the exchange between the boys about the sounds they hear, including their attempts to identify the noise and the discussion about who might be present.\n- The internal reactions and emotional shifts of the characters, such as their fear, excitement, and decision-making process, are not present.\n- The description of the boys' cautious approach, the incident with the stick, and the revelation of the snorer's identity are all missing.\n- The final actions, including their quiet exit and brief conversation after leaving, are not included.\n\n3. INACCURATE ELEMENTS:\n- Since the completion is incomplete, there are no invented events or inaccuracies in the sequence, but the lack of content means that the passage does not accurately reflect the structure or progression of the original scene."

Tom Sawyer and Huckleberry Finn, the only true witnesses to the crime, were paralyzed with a dreadful fear. They had sworn a solemn, blood-sealed oath never to reveal the terrible secret of that night. Soon, another piece of “evidence” circulated: Potter had been seen washing himself in the brook early that morning. This seemed to clinch his guilt. The sheriff quickly organized a posse to hunt him down. Tom’s conscience was a terrible burden. He knew an innocent man was being condemned, but the terrifying image of Injun Joe’s vengeful face kept his lips sealed. The secret was a constant, gnawing torment."

Nothing ’t I know of.” But the boy’s hand shook so that he spilled his coffee.\n“And you do talk such stuff,” Sid said. “Last night you said, ‘It’s blood, it’s blood, that’s what it is!’ You said that over and over. And you said, ‘Don’t torment me so—I’ll tell!’ Tell what? What is it you’ll tell?”\nEverything was swimming before Tom. There is no telling what might have happened, now, but luckily the concern passed out of Aunt Polly’s face and she came to Tom’s relief without knowing it. She said:\n“Sho! It’s that dreadful murder. I dream about it most every night myself. Sometimes I dream it’s me that done it.”\nMary said she had been affected much the same way. Sid seemed satisfied. Tom got out of the presence as quick as he plausibly could, and after that he complained of toothache for a week, and tied up his jaws every night. He never knew that Sid lay nightly watching, and frequently slipped the bandage free and then leaned on his elbow listening a good while at a time, and afterward slipped the bandage back to its place again. Tom’s distress of mind wore off gradually and the toothache grew irksome and was discarded. If Sid really managed to make anything out of Tom’s disjointed mutterings, he kept it to himself.",

He began to find himself hanging around her father’s house, nights, and feeling very miserable. She was ill. What if she should die! There was distraction in the thought. He no longer took an interest in war, nor even in piracy. The charm of life was gone; there was nothing but dreariness left. He put his hoop away, and his bat; there was no joy in them any more. His aunt was concerned. She began to try all manner of remedies on him. She was one of those people who are infatuated with patent medicines and all new-fangled methods of producing health or mending it. She was an inveterate experimenter in these things. When something fresh in this line came out she was in a fever, right away, to try it; not on herself, for she was never ailing, but on anybody else that came handy. She was a subscriber for all the “Health” periodicals and phrenological frauds; and the solemn ignorance they were inflated with was breath to her nostrils. All the “rot” they contained about ventilation, and how to go to bed, and how to get up, and what to eat, and what to drink, and how much exercise to take, and what frame of mind to keep one’s self in, and what sort of clothing to wear, was all gospel to her, and she never observed that her health-journals of the current month customarily upset everything they had recommended the month before. She was as simple-hearted and honest as the day was long, and so she was an easy victim. She gathered together her quack periodicals and her quack medicines, and thus armed with death, went about on her pale horse, metaphorically speaking, with “hell following after.” But she never suspected that she was not an angel of healing and the balm of Gilead in disguise, to the suffering neighbors.",

Presently Jeff Thatcher hove in sight, and Tom’s face lighted; he gazed a moment, and then turned sorrowfully away. When Jeff arrived, Tom accosted him; and “led up” warily to opportunities for remark about Becky, but the giddy lad never could see the bait. Tom watched and watched, hoping whenever a frisking frock came in sight, and hating the owner of it as soon as he saw she was not the right one. At last frocks ceased to appear, and he dropped hopelessly into the dumps; he entered the empty schoolhouse and sat down to suffer. Then one more frock passed in at the gate, and Tom’s heart gave a great bound. The next instant he was out, and “going on” like an Indian; yelling, laughing, chasing boys, jumping over the fence at risk of life and limb, throwing handsprings, standing on his head—doing all the heroic things he could conceive of, and keeping a furtive eye out, all the while, to see if Becky Thatcher was noticing. But she seemed to be unconscious of it all; she never looked. Could it be possible that she was not aware that he was there? He carried his exploits to her immediate vicinity; came war-whooping around, snatched a boy’s cap, hurled it to the roof of the schoolhouse, broke through a group of boys, tumbling them in every direction, and fell sprawling, himself, under Becky’s nose, almost upsetting her—and she turned, with her nose in the air, and he heard her say: “Mf! some people think they’re mighty smart—always showing off!”\nTom’s cheeks burned.

It was but a small strain on his imagination to remove Jackson’s Island beyond eye-shot of the village, and so he “looked his last” with a broken and satisfied heart.

They made him understand that his poor rags would do to begin with, though it was customary for wealthy pirates to start with a proper wardrobe.\nGradually their talk died out and drowsiness began to steal upon the eyelids of the little waifs. The pipe dropped from the fingers of the Red-Handed, and he slept the sleep of the conscience-free and the weary. The Terror of the Seas and the Black Avenger of the Spanish Main had more difficulty in getting to sleep. They said their prayers inwardly, and lying down, since there was nobody there with authority to make them kneel and recite aloud; in truth, they had a mind not to say them at all, but they were afraid to proceed to such lengths as that, lest they might call down a sudden and special thunderbolt from heaven. Then at once they reached and hovered upon the imminent verge of sleep—but an intruder came, now, that would not “down.” It was conscience. They began to feel a vague fear that they had been doing wrong to run away; and next they thought of the stolen meat, and then the real torture came. They tried to argue it away by reminding conscience that they had purloined sweetmeats and apples scores of times; but conscience was not to be appeased by such thin plausibilities; it seemed to them, in the end, that there was no getting around the stubborn fact that taking sweetmeats was only “hooking,” while taking bacon and hams and such valuables was plain simple stealing—and there was a command against that in the Bible. So they inwardly resolved that so long as they remained in the business, their piracies should not again be sullied with the crime of stealing.

The stillness, the solemnity that brooded in the woods, and the sense of loneliness, began to tell upon the spirits of the boys. They fell to thinking. A sort of undefined longing crept upon them. This took dim shape, presently—it was budding home-sickness. But they were ashamed of the feeling, and put it aside. It was a weakness which they were not yet sure they could afford to own up to. It was in this frame of mind that they hit upon their prayer-time. They had been taught to say their prayers every night, and this night was no exception. They had considered skipping them, but then they had given that up on account of the risk. After prayers they felt a good deal better, and presently Huck was snoring. But Tom and Joe lay awake and talking. They began to feel a vague fear that they had been doing wrong to run away; and next they thought of the stolen meat, and then the real torture came. They tried to argue it",
                "refinement_prompt": "IMPROVEMENT GUIDANCE:\n1. MAJOR STRUCTURAL ISSUES:\n- The completion invents a scene where one character is fashioning a pipe and another asks for a smoke, which does not occur in the original. There is also an invented exchange about whether smoking will make someone sick and a teaching moment that is not present in the source material.\n- The completion omits the entire conversation about what pirates do, their treatment of women, and their attire, which is a significant portion of the original passage.\n- The completion does not include the transition from conversation to drowsiness and sleep, nor the internal struggle with conscience that is central to the latter part of the original.\n\n2. MISSING ELEMENTS:\n- The completion lacks the group discussion about pirate activities, including their actions, treasures, and customs.\n- There is no mention of the characters’ feelings about their clothing or the reassurance given about future pirate attire.\n- The gradual onset of sleep and the detailed description of the boys’ internal moral conflict are missing.\n- The resolution of their conscience and their final peaceful sleep are not included.\n\n3. INACCURATE ELEMENTS:\n- The sequence of events is altered, with invented dialogue and actions that do not match the original order or content.\n- The roles and actions attributed to the characters are inaccurate, with the completion assigning dialogue and teaching moments that do not exist in the source.\n- The completion introduces a request for a smoke and a warning about sickness, which are not present in the original passage.\n\nTo improve, focus on accurately capturing the group’s conversation about pirate life, the emotional responses to their situation, the transition to sleep, and the internal moral debate, while avoiding invented scenes or dialogue."

Gradually the cool dim gray of the morning whitened, and as gradually sounds multiplied and life manifested itself.

A little green worm came crawling over a dewy leaf, lifting two-thirds of his body into the air from time to time and “sniffing around,” then proceeding again—for he was measuring, Tom said; and when the worm approached him, of its own accord, he sat as still as a stone, with his hopes rising and falling, by turns, as the creature still came toward him or seemed inclined to go elsewhere; and when at last it considered a painful moment with its curved body in the air and then came decisively down upon Tom’s leg and began a journey over him, his whole heart was glad—for that meant that he was going to have a new suit of clothes—without the shadow of a doubt a gaudy piratical uniform. Now a procession of ants appeared, from nowhere in particular, and went about their labors; one struggled manfully by with a dead spider five times as big as itself in its arms, and lugged it straight up a tree-trunk. A brown spotted lady-bug climbed the dizzy height of a grass blade, and Tom bent down close to it and said, “Lady-bug, lady-bug, fly away home, your house is on fire, your children’s alone,” and she took wing and went off to see about it—which did not surprise the boy, for he knew of old that this insect was credulous about conflagrations, and he had practised upon its simplicity more than once. A tumblebug came next, heaving sturdily at its ball, and Tom touched the creature, to see it shut its legs against its body and pretend to be dead. The birds were fairly rioting by this time. A catbird, the Northern mocker, lit in a tree over Tom’s head, and trilled out her imitations of her neighbors in a rapture of enjoyment; then a shrill jay swept down, a flash of blue flame, and stopped on a twig almost within the boy’s reach, cocked his head to one side and eyed the strangers with a consuming curiosity; a gray squirrel and a big fellow of the “fox” kind came skurrying along, sitting up at intervals to inspect and chatter at the boys, for the wild things had probably never seen a human being before and scarcely knew whether to be afraid or not.

He put his hand on his jacket pocket, found his piece of bark safe, and then struck through the woods, following the shore, with streaming garments. Shortly before ten o’clock he came out into an open place opposite the village, and saw the ferryboat lying in the shadow of the trees and the high bank.

He laid himself down under the thwarts and waited, panting.\nPresently the cracked bell tapped and a voice gave the order to “cast off.” A minute or two later the skiff’s head was standing high up, against the boat’s swell, and the voyage was begun.

He slipped aboard and hid himself, and soon the ferry began its slow journey back toward the Missouri side, landing a little below the town.\n\nTom disembarked and scurried through the deserted lanes. The village was asleep; not a soul was stirring. He approached his own house with a beating heart. A light was still burning in the sitting-room window. He crept into the yard and peered through a crack in the shutters. There sat Aunt Polly, Sid, Mary, and Joe Harper’s mother, gathered together. Their faces were etched with sorrow.

          "text_segment": "After dinner all the gang turned out to hunt for turtle eggs on the bar. They went about poking sticks into the sand, and when they found a soft place they went down on their knees and dug with their hands. Sometimes they would take fifty or sixty eggs out of one hole. They were perfectly round white things a trifle smaller than an English walnut. They had a famous fried-egg feast that night, and another on Friday morning.\nAfter breakfast they went whooping and prancing out on the bar, and chased each other round and round, shedding clothes as they went, until they were naked, and then continued the frolic far away up the shoal water of the bar, against the stiff current, which latter tripped their legs from under them from time to time and greatly increased the fun. And now and then they stooped in a group and splashed water in each other’s faces with their palms, gradually approaching each other, with averted faces to avoid the strangling sprays, and finally gripping and struggling till the best man ducked his neighbor, and then they all went under in a tangle of white legs and arms and came up blowing, sputtering, laughing, and gasping for breath at one and the same time.\nWhen they were well exhausted, they would run out and sprawl on the dry, hot sand, and lie there and cover themselves up with it, and by and by break for the water again and go through the original performance once more. Finally it occurred to them that their naked skin represented flesh-colored “tights” very fairly; so they drew a ring in the sand and had a circus—with three clowns in it, for none would yield this proudest post to his neighbor.\nNext they got their marbles and played “knucks” and “ringtaw” and “keeps” till that amusement grew stale. Then Joe and Huck had another swim, but Tom would not venture, because he found that in kicking off his trousers he had kicked his string of rattlesnake rattles off his ankle, and he wondered how he had escaped cramp so long without the protection of this mysterious charm. He did not venture again until he had found it, and by that time the other boys were tired and ready to rest. They gradually wandered apart, dropped into the “dumps,” and fell to gazing longingly across the wide river to where the village lay drowsing in the sun. Tom found himself writing “BECKY” in the sand with his big toe; he scratched it out, and was angry with himself for his weakness. But he wrote it again, nevertheless; he could not help it. He erased it once more and then took himself out of temptation by driving the other boys together and joining them.",

Huck was melancholy, too. Tom was downhearted, but tried hard not to show it. He had a secret which he was not ready to tell, yet, but if this mutinous depression was not broken up soon, he would have to bring it out. He said, with a great show of cheerfulness:\n“I bet there’s been pirates on this island before, boys. We’ll explore it again. They’ve hid treasures here somewhere. How’d you feel to light on a rotten chest full of gold and silver—hey?”\nBut it roused only faint enthusiasm, which faded out, with no reply. Tom tried one or two other seductions; but they failed, too. It was discouraging work. Joe sat poking up the sand with a stick and looking very gloomy. Finally he said:\n“Oh, boys, let’s give it up. I want to go home. It’s so lonesome.”\n“Oh no, Joe, you’ll feel better by and by,” said Tom. “Just think of the fishing that’s here.”\n“I don’t care for fishing. I want to go home.”\n“But, Joe, there ain’t such another swimming-place anywhere.”\n“Swimming’s no good. I don’t seem to care for it, somehow, when there ain’t anybody to say I sha’n’t go in. I mean to go home.”\n“Oh, shucks! Baby! You want to see your mother, I reckon.”\n“Yes, I do want to see my mother—and you would, too, if you had one. I ain’t any more baby than you are.” And Joe snuffled a little.\n“Well, we’ll let the crybaby go home to his mother, won’t we, Huck? Poor thing—does it want to see its mother? And so it shall. You like it here, don’t you, Huck? We’ll stay, won’t we?”\nHuck said, “Y-e-s”—without any heart in it.\n“I’ll never speak to you again as long as I live,” said Joe, rising. “There now!” And he moved moodily away and began to dress himself.\n“Who cares!” said Tom. “Nobody wants you to. Go ’long home and get laughed at. Oh, you’re a nice pirate. Huck and me ain’t crybabies. We’ll stay, won’t we, Huck? Let him go if he wants to. I reckon we can get along without him, per’aps.”\nBut Tom was uneasy, nevertheless, and was alarmed to see Joe go sullenly on with his dressing. And then it was discomforting to see Huck eying Joe’s preparations so wistfully, and keeping up such an ominous silence. Presently, without a parting word, Joe began to wade off toward the Illinois shore. Tom’s heart began to sink. He glanced at Huck. Huck could not bear the look, and dropped his eyes. Then he said:\n“I want to go, too, Tom. It was getting so lonesome anyway, and now it’ll be worse. Let’s us go, too, Tom.”\n“I won’t! You can all go, if you want to. I mean to stay.”\n“Tom, I better go.”\n“Well, go ’long—who’s hendering you.”\nHuck began to pick up his scattered clothes. He said:\n“Tom, I wisht you’d come, too. Now you think it over. We’ll wait for you when we get to shore.”\n“Well, you’ll wait a blame long time, that’s all.”\nHuck started sorrowfully away, and Tom stood looking after him, with a strong desire tugging at his heart to yield his pride and go along too. He hoped the boys would stop, but they still waded slowly on. It suddenly dawned on Tom that it was become very lonely and still. He made one final struggle with his pride, and then darted after his comrades, yelling:\n“Wait! Wait! I want to tell you something!”\nThey presently stopped and turned around. When he got to where they were, he began unfolding his secret, and they listened moodily till at last they saw the “point” he was driving at, and then they set up a warwhoop of applause and said it was “splendid!” and said if he had told them at first, they wouldn’t have started away. He made a plausible excuse; but his real reason had been the fear that not even the secret would keep them with him any very great length of time, and so he had meant to hold it in reserve as a last seduction.",

After a dainty egg and fish dinner, Tom said he wanted to learn to smoke, now. Joe caught at the idea and said he would like to try, too. So Huck made pipes and filled them. These novices had never smoked anything before but cigars made of grapevine, and they “bit” the tongue, and were not considered manly anyway.\nNow they stretched themselves out on their elbows and began to puff, charily, and with slender confidence. The smoke had an unpleasant taste, and they gagged a little, but Tom said:\n“Why, it’s just as easy! If I’d a knowed this was all, I’d a learnt long ago.”\n“So would I,” said Joe. “It’s just nothing.”\n“Why, many a time I’ve looked at people smoking, and thought well I wish I could do that; but I never thought I could,” said Tom.\n“That’s just the way with me, hain’t it, Huck? You’ve heard me talk just that way—haven’t you, Huck? I’ll leave it to Huck if I haven’t.”\n“Yes—heaps of times,” said Huck.\n“Well, I have too,” said Tom; “oh, hundreds of times. Once down by the slaughter-house. Don’t you remember, Huck? Bob Tanner was there, and Johnny Miller, and Jeff Thatcher, when I said it. Don’t you remember, Huck, ’bout me saying that?”\n“Yes, that’s so,” said Huck. “That was the day after I lost a white alley. No, ’twas the day before.”\n“There—I told you so,” said Tom. “Huck recollects it.”\n“I bleeve I could smoke this pipe all day,” said Joe. “I don’t feel sick.”\n“Neither do I,” said Tom. “I could smoke it all day. But I bet you Jeff Thatcher couldn’t.”\n“Jeff Thatcher! Why, he’d keel over just with two draws. Just let him try it once. He’d see!”\n“I bet he would. And Johnny Miller—I wish could see Johnny Miller tackle it once.”\n“Oh, don’t I!” said Joe. “Why, I bet you Johnny Miller couldn’t any more do this than nothing. Just one little snifter would fetch him.”\n“’Deed it would, Joe. Say—I wish the boys could see us now.”\n“So do I.”\n“Say—boys, don’t say anything about it, and some time when they’re around, I’ll come up to you and say, ‘Joe, got a pipe? I want a smoke.’ And you’ll say, kind of careless like, as if it warn’t anything, you’ll say, ‘Yes, I got my old pipe, and another one, but my tobacker ain’t very good.’ And I’ll say, ‘Oh, that’s all right, if it’s strong enough.’ And then you’ll out with the pipes, and we’ll light up just as ca’m, and then just see ’em look!”\n“By jings, that’ll be gay, Tom! I wish it was now!”\n“So do I! And when we tell ’em we learned when we was off pirating, won’t they wish they’d been along?”\n“Oh, I reckon not! I’ll just bet they will!”\nSo the talk ran on. But presently it began to flag a trifle, and grow disjointed. The silences widened; the expectoration marvellously increased. Every pore inside the boys’ cheeks became a spouting fountain; they could scarcely bail out the cellars under their tongues fast enough to prevent an inundation; little overflowings down their throats occurred in spite of all they could do, and sudden retchings followed every time. Both boys were looking very pale and miserable, now. Joe’s pipe dropped from his nerveless fingers. Tom’s followed. Both fountains were going furiously and both pumps bailing with might and main. Joe said feebly:\n“I’ve lost my knife. I reckon I better go and find it.”\nTom said, with quivering lips and halting utterance:\n“I’ll help you. You go over that way and I’ll hunt around by the spring. No, you needn’t come, Huck—we can find it.”\nSo Huck sat down again, and waited an hour. Then he found it lonesome, and went to find his comrades. They were wide apart in the woods, both very pale, both fast asleep. But something informed him that if they had had any trouble they had got rid of it.\nThey were not talkative at supper that night.",

Most of the dialogue, the sequence of the boys attempting to smoke, their reactions, and the aftermath are missing. The narrative stops abruptly after the introduction of the idea to smoke, failing to cover the main events and resolution.\n\n2. MISSING ELEMENTS:\n- The completion does not include the process of the boys actually smoking, their initial bravado, or their attempts to appear unaffected.\n- There is no depiction of the boys' physical reactions to smoking, such as discomfort or illness.\n- The extended conversation about their imagined future bravado in front of their peers is absent.\n- The passage describing their deteriorating condition, the pretense of searching for a lost item, and Huck’s solitary wait is not present.\n- The final scene, where Huck finds the boys and the subdued mood at supper, is missing.\n\n3. INACCURATE ELEMENTS:\n- The completion introduces a sense of languor after dinner that is not present in the original at this point; this is an invented mood not supported by the source.\n- The sequence of events is disrupted: the transition from dinner to the decision to smoke is not clearly delineated, and the subsequent actions are not described.\n- The completion does not accurately reflect the order and content of the boys’ interactions, omitting key steps and outcomes."

The boys huddled themselves together and sought the friendly companionship of the fire, though the dull dead heat of the breathless atmosphere was stifling. They sat still, intent and waiting. The solemn hush continued. Beyond the light of the fire everything was swallowed up in the blackness of darkness. Presently there came a quivering glow that vaguely revealed the foliage for a moment and then vanished. By and by another came, a little stronger. Then another. Then a faint moan came sighing through the branches of the forest and the boys felt a fleeting breath upon their cheeks, and shuddered with the fancy that the Spirit of the Night had gone by. There was a pause. Now a weird flash turned night into day and showed every little grassblade, separate and distinct, that grew about their feet. And it showed three white, startled faces, too. A deep peal of thunder went rolling and tumbling down the heavens and lost itself in sullen rumblings in the distance. A sweep of chilly air passed by, rustling all the leaves and snowing the flaky ashes broadcast about the fire.

And now a drenching rain poured down and the rising hurricane drove it in sheets along the ground. The boys cried out to each other, but the roaring wind and the booming thunderblasts drowned their voices utterly. However, one by one they straggled in at last and took shelter under the tent, cold, scared, and streaming with water; but to have company in misery seemed something to be grateful for. They could not talk, the old sail flapped so furiously, even if the other noises would have allowed them. The tempest rose higher and higher, and presently the sail tore loose from its fastenings and went winging away on the blast. The boys seized each others’ hands and fled, with many tumblings and bruises, to the shelter of a great oak that stood upon the riverbank. Now the battle was at its highest. Under the ceaseless conflagration of lightning that flamed in the skies, everything below stood out in cleancut and shadowless distinctness: the bending trees, the billowy river, white with foam, the driving spray of spumeflakes, the dim outlines of the high bluffs on the other side, glimpsed through the drifting cloudrack and the slanting veil of rain. Every little while some giant tree yielded the fight and fell crashing through the younger growth; and the unflagging thunderpeals came now in ear-splitting explosive bursts, keen and sharp, and unspeakably appalling. The storm culminated in one matchless effort that seemed likely to tear the island to pieces, burn it up, drown it to the treetops, blow it away, and deafen every creature in it, all at one and the same moment. It was a wild night for homeless young heads to be out in.\nBut at last the battle was done, and the forces retired with weaker and weaker threatenings and grumblings, and peace resumed her sway. The boys went back to camp, a good deal awed; but they found there was still something to be thankful for, because the great sycamore, the shelter of their beds, was a ruin, now, blasted by the lightnings, and they were not under it when the catastrophe happened.\nEverything in camp was drenched, the campfire as well; for they were but heedless lads, like their generation, and had made no provision against rain. Here was matter for dismay, for they were soaked through and chilled. They were eloquent in their distress; but they presently discovered that the fire had eaten so far up under the great log it had been built against (where it curved upward and separated itself from the ground), that a handbreadth or so of it had escaped wetting; so they patiently wrought until, with shreds and bark gathered from the under sides of sheltered logs, they coaxed the fire to burn again. Then they piled on great dead boughs till they had a roaring furnace, and were gladhearted once more. They dried their boiled ham and had a feast, and after that they sat by the fire and expanded and glorified their midnight adventure until morning, for there was not a dry spot to sleep on, anywhere around.",

Tom saw the signs, and fell to cheering up the pirates as well as he could. But they cared nothing for marbles, or circus, or swimming, or anything. He reminded them of the imposing secret, and raised a ray of cheer. While it lasted, he got them interested in a new device. This was to knock off being pirates, for a while, and be Indians for a change. They were attracted by this idea; so it was not long before they were stripped, and striped from head to heel with black mud, like so many zebras—all of them chiefs, of course—and then they went tearing through the woods to attack an English settlement.\nBy and by they separated into three hostile tribes, and darted upon each other from ambush with dreadful warwhoops, and killed and scalped each other by thousands. It was a gory day. Consequently it was an extremely satisfactory one.\nThey assembled in camp toward suppertime, hungry and happy; but now a difficulty arose—hostile Indians could not break the bread of hospitality together without first making peace, and this was a simple impossibility without smoking a pipe of peace. There was no other process that ever they had heard of. Two of the savages almost wished they had remained pirates. However, there was no other way; so with such show of cheerfulness as they could muster they called for the pipe and took their whiff as it passed, in due form.\nAnd behold, they were glad they had gone into savagery, for they had gained something; they found that they could now smoke a little without having to go and hunt for a lost knife; they did not get sick enough to be seriously uncomfortable. They were not likely to fool away this high promise for lack of effort. No, they practised cautiously, after supper, with right fair success, and so they spent a jubilant evening. They were prouder and happier in their new acquirement than they would have been in the scalping and skinning of the Six Nations.

If you could come over on a log to go to your funeral, you could have come over and give me a hint some way that you warn’t dead, but only run off.”\n“Yes, you could have done that, Tom,” said Mary; “and I believe you would if you had thought of it.”\n“Would you, Tom?” said Aunt Polly, her face lighting wistfully. “Say, now, would you, if you’d thought of it?”\n“I—well, I don’t know. ’Twould ’a’ spoiled everything.”\n“Tom, I hoped you loved me that much,” said Aunt Polly, with a grieved tone that discomforted the boy. “It would have been something if you’d cared enough to think of it, even if you didn’t do it.”\n“Now, auntie, that ain’t any harm,” pleaded Mary; “it’s only Tom’s giddy way—he is always in such a rush that he never thinks of anything.”\n“More’s the pity. Sid would have thought. And Sid would have come and done it, too.

There was an angel there, somewheres!”\n“And Mrs. Harper told about Joe scaring her with a firecracker, and you told about Peter and the Pain-killer—”\n“Just as true as I live!”\n“And then there was a whole lot of talk ’bout dragging the river for us, and ’bout having the funeral Sunday, and then you and old Miss Harper hugged and cried, and she went.”\n“It happened just so! It happened just so, as sure as I’m a-sitting in these very tracks. Tom, you couldn’t told it more like if you’d ’a’ seen it! And then what? Go on, Tom!”\n“Then I thought you prayed for me—and I could see you and hear every word you said. And you went to bed, and I was so sorry that I took and wrote on a piece of sycamore bark, ‘We ain’t dead—we are only off being pirates,’ and put it on the table by the candle; and then you looked so good, laying there asleep, that I thought I went and leaned over and kissed you on the lips.”\n“Did you, Tom, did you!

Now that he was distinguished, maybe she would be wanting to “make up.” Well, let her—she should see that he could be as indifferent as some other people. Presently she arrived. Tom pretended not to see her. He moved away and joined a group of boys and girls and began to talk. Soon he observed that she was tripping gayly back and forth with flushed face and dancing eyes, pretending to be busy chasing schoolmates, and screaming with laughter when she made a capture; but he noticed that she always made her captures in his vicinity, and that she seemed to cast a conscious eye in his direction at such times, too. It gratified all the vicious vanity that was in him; and so, instead of winning him, it only “set him up” the more and made him the more diligent to avoid betraying that he knew she was about. Presently she gave over skylarking, and moved irresolutely about, sighing once or twice and glancing furtively and wistfully toward Tom. Then she observed that now Tom was talking more particularly to Amy Lawrence than to any one else. She felt a sharp pang and grew disturbed and uneasy at once. She tried to go away, but her feet were treacherous, and carried her to the group instead. She said to a girl almost at Tom’s elbow—with sham vivacity:\n“Why, Mary Austin! you bad girl, why didn’t you come to Sunday-school?”\n“I did come—didn’t you see me?”\n“Why, no! Did you? Where did you sit?”\n“I was in Miss Peters’ class, where I always go. I saw you.”\n“Did you? Why, it’s funny I didn’t see you. I wanted to tell you about the picnic.”\n“Oh, that’s jolly. Who’s going to give it?”\n“My ma’s going to let me have one.”\n“Oh, goody; I hope she’ll let me come.”\n“Well, she will. The picnic’s for me. She’ll let anybody come that I want, and I want you.”\n“That’s ever so nice. When is it going to be?”\n“By and by. Maybe about vacation.”\n“Oh, won’t it be fun! You going to have all the girls and boys?”\n“Yes, every one that’s friends to me—or wants to be”; and she glanced ever so furtively at Tom, but he talked right along to Amy Lawrence about the terrible storm on the island, and how the lightning tore the great sycamore tree “all to flinders” while he was “standing within three feet of it.”\n“Oh, may I come?” said Grace Miller.\n“Yes.”\n“And me?” said Sally Rogers.\n“Yes.”\n“And me, too?” said Susy Harper. “And Joe?”\n“Yes.”\nAnd so on, with clapping of joyful hands till all the group had begged for invitations but Tom and Amy. Then Tom turned coolly away, still talking, and took Amy with him. Becky’s lips trembled and the tears came to her eyes; she hid these signs with a forced gayety and went on chattering, but the life had gone out of the picnic, now, and out of everything else; she got away as soon as she could and hid herself and had what her sex call “a good cry.” Then she sat moody, with wounded pride, till the bell rang. She roused up, now, with a vindictive cast in her eye, and gave her plaited tails a shake and said she knew what she’d do.",

She knew the schoolmaster, Mr. Dobbins, would be furious and a terrible whipping was certain. A fierce struggle began in her heart. She wanted to see Tom punished, to make him suffer as he had made her suffer. Yet, a part of her recoiled at the treachery. She pictured his surprised and hurt face when the master called him up. But then she remembered his cruel words about Amy Lawrence, and her heart hardened. “Let him get a whipping,” she whispered to herself, her lips trembling. “I don’t care. It serves him right. He’ll be sorry he ever treated me so.” She turned her face away, resolving not to look again, sealing Tom’s fate with her silence."

Every boy and girl had a theory about the nature of that book; but no two theories were alike, and there was no way of getting at the facts in the case.

She glanced around; found herself alone, and the next instant she had the book in her hands. The titlepage—Professor Somebody’s Anatomy—carried no information to her mind; so she began to turn the leaves.

He had his own reasons for being delighted, for the master boarded in his father’s family and had given the boy ample cause to hate him.

The meagre Latin class recited with honor. The prime feature of the evening was in order, now—original “compositions” by the young ladies. Each in her turn stepped forward to the edge of the platform, cleared her throat, held up her manuscript (tied with dainty ribbon), and proceeded to read, with labored attention to “expression” and punctuation. The themes were the same that had been illuminated upon similar occasions by their mothers before them, their grandmothers, and doubtless all their ancestors in the female line clear back to the Crusades. “Friendship” was one; “Memories of Other Days”; “Religion in History”; “Dream Land”; “The Advantages of Culture”; “Forms of Political Government Compared and Contrasted”; “Melancholy”; “Filial Love”; “Heart Longings,” etc., etc.\nA prevalent feature in these compositions was a nursed and petted melancholy; another was a wasteful and opulent gush of “fine language”; another was a tendency to lug in by the ears particularly prized words and phrases until they were worn entirely out; and a peculiarity that conspicuously marked and marred them was the inveterate and intolerable sermon that wagged its crippled tail at the end of each and every one of them. No matter what the subject might be, a brainracking effort was made to squirm it into some aspect or other that the moral and religious mind could contemplate with edification. The glaring insincerity of these sermons was not sufficient to compass the banishment of the fashion from the schools, and it is not sufficient today; it never will be sufficient while the world stands, perhaps. There is no school in all our land where the young ladies do not feel obliged to close their compositions with a sermon; and you will find that the sermon of the most frivolous and the least religious girl in the school is always the longest and the most relentlessly pious.

          "text_segment": "Let us return to the “Examination.” The first composition that was read was one entitled “Is this, then, Life?” Perhaps the reader can endure an extract from it:\n“In the common walks of life, with what delightful emotions does the youthful mind look forward to some anticipated scene of festivity! Imagination is busy sketching rose-tinted pictures of joy. In fancy, the voluptuous votary of fashion sees herself amid the festive throng, ‘the observed of all observers.’ Her graceful form, arrayed in snowy robes, is whirling through the mazes of the joyous dance; her eye is brightest, her step is lightest in the gay assembly.\n“In such delicious fancies time quickly glides by, and the welcome hour arrives for her entrance into the Elysian world, of which she has had such bright dreams. How fairy-like does everything appear to her enchanted vision! Each new scene is more charming than the last. But after a while she finds that beneath this goodly exterior, all is vanity, the flattery which once charmed her soul, now grates harshly upon her ear; the ballroom has lost its charms; and with wasted health and imbittered heart, she turns away with the conviction that earthly pleasures cannot satisfy the longings of the soul!”\nAnd so forth and so on. There was a buzz of gratification from time to time during the reading, accompanied by whispered ejaculations of “How sweet!” “How eloquent!” “So true!” etc., and after the thing had closed with a peculiarly afflicting sermon the applause was enthusiastic.\nThen arose a slim, melancholy girl, whose face had the “interesting” paleness that comes of pills and indigestion, and read a “poem.” Two stanzas of it will do:\n“A MISSOURI MAIDEN’S FAREWELL TO ALABAMA\n“Alabama, goodbye! I love thee well!\n    But yet for a while do I leave thee now!\nSad, yes, sad thoughts of thee my heart doth swell,\n    And burning recollections throng my brow!\nFor I have wandered through thy flowery woods;\n    Have roamed and read near Tallapoosa’s stream;\nHave listened to Tallassee’s warring floods,\n    And wooed on Coosa’s side Aurora’s beam.\n\n“Yet shame I not to bear an o’erfull heart,\n    Nor blush to turn behind my tearful eyes;\n’Tis from no stranger land I now must part,\n    ’Tis to no strangers left I yield these sighs.\nWelcome and home were mine within this State,\n    Whose vales I leave—whose spires fade fast from me\nAnd cold must be mine eyes, and heart, and tête,\n    When, dear Alabama! they turn cold on thee!”\nThere were very few there who knew what “tête” meant, but the poem was very satisfactory, nevertheless.\nNext appeared a dark-complexioned, black-eyed, black-haired young lady, who paused an impressive moment, assumed a tragic expression, and began to read in a measured, solemn tone:\nDark and tempestuous was night. Around the throne on high not a single star quivered; but the deep intonations of the heavy thunder constantly vibrated upon the ear; whilst the terrific lightning revelled in angry mood through the cloudy chambers of heaven, seeming to scorn the power exerted over its terror by the illustrious Franklin! Even the boisterous winds unanimously came forth from their mystic homes, and blustered about as if to enhance by their aid the wildness of the scene.\nAt such a time, so dark, so dreary, for human sympathy my very spirit sighed; but instead thereof,\n ‘My dearest friend, my counsellor, my comforter and guide—\n        My joy in grief, my second bliss in joy,’ came to my side.\nShe moved like one of those bright beings pictured in the sunny walks of fancy’s Eden by the romantic and young, a queen of beauty unadorned save by her own transcendent loveliness. So soft was her step, it failed to make even a sound, and but for the magical thrill imparted by her genial touch, as other unobtrusive beauties, she would have glided away unperceived—unsought. A strange sadness rested upon her features, like icy tears upon the robe of December, as she pointed to the contending elements without, and bade me contemplate the two beings presented.\nThis nightmare occupied some ten pages of manuscript and wound up with a sermon so destructive of all hope to non-Presbyterians that it took the first prize. This composition was considered to be the very finest effort of the evening. The mayor of the village, in delivering the prize to the author of it, made a warm speech in which he said that it was by far the most “eloquent” thing he had ever listened to, and that Daniel Webster himself might well be proud of it.\nIt may be remarked, in passing, that the number of compositions in which the word “beauteous” was over-fondled, and human experience referred to as “life’s page,” was up to the usual average.",

She presented a picture of a youthful, wayward soul, yearning for the festive scenes; in a word, “the world.” She sought it—found it—and had got drunk on its intoxicating draughts. The first sip of pleasure, on being exalted to the head of the social life in the village, had been delirious; the succeeding draughts had been less grateful; the latest one had cooled forever the fires that burned in her heart and now, the chill disillusionment weighing upon her, she cast down the goblet of life and longed for the grave. A thunderous discharge of applause followed. The boy-orators were apparently Zadkiels and Nostradamuses in their thoughts and words. The villagers were amazed and delighted. A slim, melancholy girl, whose face had the “interesting” pallor of wasting ill health, delivered a composition in a thin, frightened voice. Its title was “A Missouri Maiden’s Farewell to Alabama.” The theme was the parting of a maiden from her native land—Alabama—and her friends. Its conclusion was a touching reference to the lilies and the birds of Alabama. It was received with a great deal of favor. Then followed the grand event of the evening. A dark-complexioned young lady, with a tragic face, read in a measured, solemn voice a composition which she had written, and which was the pride of the school. Its title was “A Vision.” It was a tale of a storm-tossed soul on a stormy sea. The soul was saved at last by a life-boat labeled “Religion.” The girl had been wasting her oil. She had written this composition, which was about ten pages of manuscript, in the intimate seclusion of her own room, and had read it to no one. It was a triumph. The prize, a copy of “Pope’s Essay on Man,” was awarded to her. The mayor of the village, in delivering the prize, made a speech. He said that it was a poem. He said it was without fault. He said that he had read a great many poems in his time, but that this one was the most beautiful. He was sure that Daniel Webster himself could not have written such a poem. The elocution of the young lady had been fine—he had been affected to tears by it. The villagers were proud of her. The school-teacher was proud of her. The parents were proud of her. She was the heroine of the night.\"\n}\n```",

He threw his entire attention upon his work, now, as if determined not to be put down by the mirth. He felt that all eyes were fastened upon him; he imagined he was succeeding, and yet the tittering continued; it even manifestly increased. And well it might. There was a garret above, pierced with a scuttle over his head; and down through this scuttle came a cat, suspended around the haunches by a string; she had a rag tied about her head and jaws to keep her from mewing; as she slowly descended she curved upward and clawed at the string, she swung downward and clawed at the intangible air. The tittering rose higher and higher—the cat was within six inches of the absorbed teacher’s head—down, down, a little lower, and she grabbed his wig with her desperate claws, clung to it, and was snatched up into the garret in an instant with her trophy still in her possession!

Now he found out a new thing—namely, that to promise not to do a thing is the surest way in the world to make a body want to go and do that very thing. Tom soon found himself tormented with a desire to drink and swear; the desire grew to be so intense that nothing but the hope of a chance to display himself in his red sash kept him from withdrawing from the order. Fourth of July was coming; but he soon gave that up—gave it up before he had worn his shackles over forty-eight hours—and fixed his hopes upon old Judge Frazer, justice of the peace, who was apparently on his deathbed and would have a big public funeral, since he was so high an official. During three days Tom was deeply concerned about the Judge’s condition and hungry for news of it. Sometimes his hopes ran high—so high that he would venture to get out his regalia and practise before the looking-glass. But the Judge had a most discouraging way of fluctuating. At last he was pronounced upon the mend—and then convalescent. Tom was disgusted; and felt a sense of injury, too. He handed in his resignation at once—and that night the Judge suffered a relapse and died. Tom resolved that he would never trust a man like that again.\nThe funeral was a fine thing. The Cadets paraded in a style calculated to kill the late member with envy. Tom was a free boy again, however—there was something in that. He could drink and swear, now—but found to his surprise that he did not want to. The simple fact that he could, took the desire away, and the charm of it.",

He was on the ground floor and there were no guards.\nHis gratitude for their gifts had always smote their consciences before—it cut deeper than ever, this time. They felt cowardly and treacherous to the last degree when Potter said:\n“You’ve been mighty good to me, boys—better’n anybody else in this town. And I don’t forget it, I don’t. Often I says to myself, says I, ‘I used to mend all the boys’ kites and things, and show ’em where the good fishin’ places was, and befriend ’em what I could, and now they’ve all forgot old Muff when he’s in trouble; but Tom don’t, and Huck don’t—they don’t forget him,’ says I, ‘and I don’t forget them.’ Well, boys, I done an awful thing—drunk and crazy at the time—that’s the only way I account for it—and now I got to swing for it, and it’s right. Right, and best, too, I reckon—hope so, anyway. Well, we won’t talk about that. I don’t want to make you feel bad; you’ve befriended me. But what I want to say, is, don’t you ever get drunk—then you won’t ever get here. Stand a litter furder west—so—that’s it; it’s a prime comfort to see faces that’s friendly when a body’s in such a muck of trouble, and there don’t none come here but yourn. Good friendly faces—good friendly faces. Git up on one another’s backs and let me touch ’em. That’s it. Shake hands—yourn’ll come through the bars, but mine’s too big.

They slunk around to the grated window of the jail, and stood there, listening. A light was burning within. Muff Potter was lying on a straw tick, and had his face to the wall. His back was to them. The boys went on tiptoe to the grated window, and Tom called in a low voice:\\n\\n“Muff! Muff!”\\n\\nPotter started, and turned over. He was chained. He sat up, and looked around, bewildered. The boys put their mouths to the grating, and Tom whispered:\\n\\n“We’re friends of yours, Muff. We’ve brought you something.”\\n\\nPotter’s face lighted up. He came to the window, and took the tobacco and matches the boys had brought him. He was on the ground floor, and there were no guards. His gratitude was pathetic.\\n\\n“You’ve been mighty good to me, boys—better’n anybody else in this town. And I don’t forget it, I don’t.

MAJOR STRUCTURAL ISSUES:\n- The completion omits a significant portion of the original conversation between the two boys, especially after the initial exchange. The dialogue is cut off early and does not progress to the later, more emotional and reflective parts involving their feelings about Muff Potter and their actions toward him.\n- The entire scene involving the boys visiting the jail, interacting with Muff Potter, and his heartfelt response is missing.\n\n2. MISSING ELEMENTS:\n- The completion lacks the detailed discussion about Muff Potter’s character and the boys’ personal experiences with him, which are present in the original.\n- There is no mention of the townspeople’s attitudes or threats, which are a key part of the original passage.\n- The sequence where the boys bring items to Muff Potter and their feelings of guilt is not included.\n- The original’s closing reflections and Muff Potter’s direct speech to the boys are absent.\n\n3. INACCURATE ELEMENTS:\n- The completion introduces a phrase about feeling sick, which is not aligned with the original’s depiction of anxiety and fear.\n- The assertion that the townspeople are going to hang Muff Potter is presented as a certainty, whereas the original handles this with more nuance and indirectness.\n- The sequence of the conversation is altered, with some lines attributed to the wrong speaker and the flow of the exchange not matching the original order.\n- The completion ends abruptly, leaving out the resolution and emotional impact found at the end of the original passage."

Both sexes were about equally represented in the packed audience. After a long wait the jury filed in and took their places; shortly afterward, Potter, pale and haggard, timid and hopeless, was brought in, with chains upon him, and seated where all the curious eyes could stare at him; no less conspicuous was Injun Joe, stolid as ever.

He knew he had to act, to speak the truth, no matter the cost. As the prosecutor sat down with a flourish and the judge turned to the defense, a sudden, agonizing silence fell over the courtroom.

The audience listened breathless, but the words refused to come. After a few moments, however, the boy got a little of his strength back, and managed to put enough of it into his voice to make part of the house hear:\n“In the graveyard!”\n“A little bit louder, please. Don’t be afraid. You were—”\n“In the graveyard.”\nA contemptuous smile flitted across Injun Joe’s face.\n“Were you anywhere near Horse Williams’ grave?”\n“Yes, sir.”\n“Speak up—just a trifle louder. How near were you?”\n“Near as I am to you.”\n“Were you hidden, or not?”\n“I was hid.”\n“Where?”\n“Behind the elms that’s on the edge of the grave.”\nInjun Joe gave a barely perceptible start.\n“Any one with you?”\n“Yes, sir. I went there with—”\n“Wait—wait a moment. Never mind mentioning your companion’s name. We will produce him at the proper time. Did you carry anything there with you.”\nTom hesitated and looked confused.\n“Speak out, my boy—don’t be diffident. The truth is always respectable. What did you take there?”\n“Only a—a—dead cat.”\nThere was a ripple of mirth, which the court checked.\n“We will produce the skeleton of that cat. Now, my boy, tell us everything that occurred—tell it in your own way—don’t skip anything, and don’t be afraid.”\nTom began—hesitatingly at first, but as he warmed to his subject his words flowed more and more easily; in a little while every sound ceased but his own voice; every eye fixed itself upon him; with parted lips and bated breath the audience hung upon his words, taking no note of time, rapt in the ghastly fascinations of the tale. The strain upon pent emotion reached its climax when the boy said:\n“—and as the doctor fetched the board around and Muff Potter fell, Injun Joe jumped with the knife and—”\nCrash! Quick as lightning the halfbreed sprang for a window, tore his way through all opposers, and was gone!",

Then, his gaze flickered to the shadowed corner where Injun Joe sat, impassive and menacing, his arms crossed over his chest. Taking a shaky breath, Tom found his voice, a thin but clear treble that cut through the profound silence. “I was in the graveyard.” A wave of murmurs swept through the crowd. The judge leaned forward, his brow furrowed. “In the graveyard? And what were you doing there at such an hour?” “We was… I was there with a friend,” Tom stammered, careful not to name Huck. “We were… messing around with a dead cat"

Look at pap and my mother. Fight! Why, they used to fight all the time. I remember, mighty well.”\n“That ain’t anything. The girl I’m going to marry won’t fight.”\n“Tom, I reckon they’re all alike. They’ll all comb a body. Now you better think ’bout this awhile. I tell you you better. What’s the name of the gal?”\n“It ain’t a gal at all—it’s a girl.”\n“It’s all the same, I reckon; some says gal, some says girl—both’s right, like enough.

Spirits whispered in the rustling leaves, ghosts lurked in the murky nooks, the deep baying of a hound floated up out of the distance, an owl answered with his sepulchral note. The boys were subdued by these solemnities, and talked little. By and by they judged that twelve had come; they marked where the shadow fell, and began to dig. Their hopes commenced to rise. Their interest grew stronger, and their industry kept pace with it. The hole deepened and still deepened, but every time their hearts jumped to hear the pick strike upon something, they only suffered a new disappointment. It was only a stone or a chunk. At last Tom said:\n“It ain’t any use, Huck, we’re wrong again.”\n“Well, but we can’t be wrong. We spotted the shadder to a dot.”\n“I know it, but then there’s another thing.”\n“What’s that?”\n“Why, we only guessed at the time. Like enough it was too late or too early.”\nHuck dropped his shovel.\n“That’s it,” said he. “That’s the very trouble. We got to give this one up. We can’t ever tell the right time, and besides this kind of thing’s too awful, here this time of night with witches and ghosts a-fluttering around so. I feel as if something’s behind me all the time;  and I’m afeard to turn around, becuz maybe there’s others in front a-waiting for a chance. I been creeping all over, ever since I got here.”\n“Well, I’ve been pretty much so, too, Huck. They most always put in a dead man when they bury a treasure under a tree, to look out for it.”\n“Lordy!”\n“Yes, they do. I’ve always heard that.”\n“Tom, I don’t like to fool around much where there’s dead people. A body’s bound to get into trouble with ’em, sure.”\n“I don’t like to stir ’em up, either. S’pose this one here was to stick his skull out and say something!”\n“Don’t Tom! It’s awful.”\n“Well, it just is. Huck, I don’t feel comfortable a bit.”\n“Say, Tom, let’s give this place up, and try somewheres else.”\n“All right, I reckon we better.”\n“What’ll it be?”",

I couldn’t stand such a thing as that, Tom—nobody could.”\n“Yes, but, Huck, ghosts don’t travel around only at night. They won’t hender us from digging there in the daytime.”\n“Well, that’s so. But you know mighty well people don’t go about that ha’nted house in the day nor the night.”\n“Well, that’s mostly because they don’t like to go where a man’s been murdered, anyway—but nothing’s ever been seen around that house except in the night—just some blue lights slipping by the windows—no regular ghosts.”\n“Well, where you see one of them blue lights flickering around, Tom, you can bet there’s a ghost mighty close behind it. It stands to reason. Becuz you know that they don’t anybody but ghosts use ’em.”\n“Yes, that’s so. But anyway they don’t come around in the daytime, so what’s the use of our being afeard?”\n“Well, all right. We’ll tackle the ha’nted house if you say so—but I reckon it’s taking chances.”\nThey had started down the hill by this time.

I never once thought of it, Huck!”\n“Well, I didn’t neither, but all at once it popped onto me that it was Friday.”\n“Blame it, a body can’t be too careful, Huck. We might ’a’ got into an awful scrape, tackling such a thing on a Friday.”\n“Might! Better say we would! There’s some lucky days, maybe, but Friday ain’t.”\n“Any fool knows that. I don’t reckon you was the first that found it out, Huck.”\n“Well, I never said I was, did I? And Friday ain’t all, neither. I had a rotten bad dream last night—dreampt about rats.”\n“No! Sure sign of trouble. Did they fight?”\n“No.”\n“Well, that’s good, Huck. When they don’t fight it’s only a sign that there’s trouble around, you know. All we got to do is to look mighty sharp and keep out of it. We’ll drop this thing for today, and play. Do you know Robin Hood, Huck?”\n“No. Who’s Robin Hood?”\n“Why, he was one of the greatest men that was ever in England—and the best. He was a robber.”\n“Cracky, I wisht I was. Who did he rob?”\n“Only sheriffs and bishops and rich people and kings, and such like. But he never bothered the poor. He loved ’em. He always divided up with ’em perfectly square.”\n“Well, he must ’a’ been a brick.”\n“I bet you he was, Huck. Oh, he was the noblest man that ever was. They ain’t any such men now, I can tell you. He could lick any man in England, with one hand tied behind him; and he could take his yew bow and plug a ten-cent piece every time, a mile and a half.”\n“What’s a yew bow?”\n“I don’t know. It’s some kind of a bow, of course. And if he hit that dime only on the edge he would set down and cry—and curse. But we’ll play Robin Hood—it’s nobby fun. I’ll learn you.”\n“I’m agreed.”\nSo they played Robin Hood all the afternoon, now and then casting a yearning eye down upon the haunted house and passing a remark about the morrow’s prospects and possibilities there.

The thing failed this time, however, so the boys shouldered their tools and went away feeling that they had not trifled with fortune, but had fulfilled all the requirements that belong to the business of treasure-hunting.\nWhen they reached the haunted house there was something so weird and grisly about the dead silence that reigned there under the baking sun, and something so depressing about the loneliness and desolation of the place, that they were afraid, for a moment, to venture in. Then they crept to the door and took a trembling peep. They saw a weedgrown, floorless room, unplastered, an ancient fireplace, vacant windows, a ruinous staircase; and here, there, and everywhere hung ragged and abandoned cobwebs. They presently entered, softly, with quickened pulses, talking in whispers, ears alert to catch the slightest sound, and muscles tense and ready for instant retreat.\nIn a little while familiarity modified their fears and they gave the place a critical and interested examination, rather admiring their own boldness, and wondering at it, too. Next they wanted to look upstairs. This was something like cutting off retreat, but they got to daring each other, and of course there could be but one result—they threw their tools into a corner and made the ascent. Up there were the same signs of decay. In one corner they found a closet that promised mystery, but the promise was a fraud—there was nothing in it. Their courage was up now and well in hand.

It was not the custom for elderly people to mar the picnics with their presence. The children were considered safe enough under the wings of a few young ladies of eighteen and a few young gentlemen of twenty-three or thereabouts. The old steam ferry-boat was chartered for the occasion; presently the gay throng filed up the main street laden with provision-baskets. Sid was sick and had to miss the fun; Mary remained at home to entertain him. The last thing Mrs. Thatcher said to Becky, was:\n“You’ll not get back till late. Perhaps you’d better stay all night with some of the girls that live near the ferry-landing, child.”\n“Then I’ll stay with Susy Harper, mamma.”\n“Very well. And mind and behave yourself and don’t be any trouble.”\nPresently, as they tripped along, Tom said to Becky:\n“Say—I’ll tell you what we’ll do. ’Stead of going to Joe Harper’s we’ll climb right up the hill and stop at the Widow Douglas’. She’ll have ice-cream! She has it most every day—dead loads of it. And she’ll be awful glad to have us.”\n“Oh, that will be fun!”\nThen Becky reflected a moment and said:\n“But what will mamma say?”\n“How’ll she ever know?”\nThe girl turned the idea over in her mind, and said reluctantly:\n“I reckon it’s wrong—but—”\n“But shucks! Your mother won’t know, and so what’s the harm? All she wants is that you’ll be safe; and I bet you she’d ’a’ said go there if she’d ’a’ thought of it. I know she would!”\nThe Widow Douglas’ splendid hospitality was a tempting bait. It and Tom’s persuasions presently carried the day. So it was decided to say nothing to anybody about the night’s programme. Presently it occurred to Tom that maybe Huck might come this very night and give the signal. The thought took a deal of the spirit out of his anticipations. Still he could not bear to give up the fun at Widow Douglas’. And why should he give it up, he reasoned—the signal did not come the night before, so why should it be any more likely to come tonight? The sure fun of the evening outweighed the uncertain treasure; and, boy-like, he determined to yield to the stronger inclination and not allow himself to think of the box of money another time that day.",

All the different ways of getting hot and tired were gone through with, and by-and-by the rovers straggled back to camp fortified with responsible appetites, and then the destruction of the good things began. After the feast there was a refreshing season of rest and chat in the shade of spreading oaks. By-and-by somebody shouted:\n“Who’s ready for the cave?”\nEverybody was. Bundles of candles were procured, and straightway there was a general scamper up the hill. The mouth of the cave was up the hillside—an opening shaped like a letter A. Its massive oaken door stood unbarred. Within was a small chamber, chilly as an icehouse, and walled by Nature with solid limestone that was dewy with a cold sweat. It was romantic and mysterious to stand here in the deep gloom and look out upon the green valley shining in the sun. But the impressiveness of the situation quickly wore off, and the romping began again. The moment a candle was lighted there was a general rush upon the owner of it; a struggle and a gallant defence followed, but the candle was soon knocked down or blown out, and then there was a glad clamor of laughter and a new chase. But all things have an end. By-and-by the procession went filing down the steep descent of the main avenue, the flickering rank of lights dimly revealing the lofty walls of rock almost to their point of junction sixty feet overhead. This main avenue was not more than eight or ten feet wide. Every few steps other lofty and still narrower crevices branched from it on either hand—for McDougal’s cave was but a vast labyrinth of crooked aisles that ran into each other and out again and led nowhere. It was said that one might wander days and nights together through its intricate tangle of rifts and chasms, and never find the end of the cave; and that he might go down, and down, and still down, into the earth, and it was just the same—labyrinth under labyrinth, and no end to any of them. No man “knew” the cave. That was an impossible thing. Most of the young men knew a portion of it, and it was not customary to venture much beyond this known portion.

It would be absurd—the men would get away with the box and never be found again. No, he would stick to their wake and follow them; he would trust to the darkness for security from discovery. So communing with himself, Huck stepped out and glided along behind the men, cat-like, with bare feet, allowing them to keep just far enough ahead not to be invisible.\nThey moved up the river street three blocks, then turned to the left up a crossstreet. They went straight ahead, then, until they came to the path that led up Cardiff Hill; this they took. They passed by the old Welshman’s house, halfway up the hill, without hesitating, and still climbed upward. Good, thought Huck, they will bury it in the old quarry. But they never stopped at the quarry. They passed on, up the summit. They plunged into the narrow path between the tall sumach bushes, and were at once hidden in the gloom. Huck closed up and shortened his distance, now, for they would never be able to see him. He trotted along awhile; then slackened his pace, fearing he was gaining too fast; moved on a piece, then stopped altogether; listened; no sound; none, save that he seemed to hear the beating of his own heart. The hooting of an owl came over the hill—ominous sound! But no footsteps. Heavens, was everything lost! He was about to spring with winged feet, when a man cleared his throat not four feet from him! Huck’s heart shot into his throat, but he swallowed it again; and then he stood there shaking as if a dozen agues had taken charge of him at once, and so weak that he thought he must surely fall to the ground. He knew where he was. He knew he was within five steps of the stile leading into Widow Douglas’ grounds. Very well, he thought, let them bury it there; it won’t be hard to find.",

A deadly chill went to Huck’s heart—this, then, was the “revenge” job! His thought was, to fly. Then he remembered that the Widow Douglas had been kind to him more than once, and maybe these men were going to murder her. He wished he dared venture to warn her; but he knew he didn’t dare—they might come and catch him. He thought all this and more in the moment that elapsed between the stranger’s remark and Injun Joe’s next—which was—\n“Because the bush is in your way. Now—this way—now you see, don’t you?”\n“Yes. Well, there is company there, I reckon. Better give it up.”\n“Give it up, and I just leaving this country forever! Give it up and maybe never have another chance. I tell you again, as I’ve told you before, I don’t care for her swag—you may have it. But her husband was rough on me—many times he was rough on me—and mainly he was the justice of the peace that jugged me for a vagrant. And that ain’t all. It ain’t a millionth part of it! He had me horsewhipped!—horsewhipped in front of the jail, like a nigger!—with all the town looking on! Horsewhipped!—do you understand? He took advantage of me and died. But I’ll take it out of her.”\n“Oh, don’t kill her! Don’t do that!”\n“Kill? Who said anything about killing? I would kill him if he was here; but not her. When you want to get revenge on a woman you don’t kill her—bosh! you go for her looks. You slit her nostrils—you notch her ears like a sow!”\n“By God, that’s—”\n“Keep your opinion to yourself! It will be safest for you. I’ll tie her to the bed. If she bleeds to death, is that my fault? I’ll not cry, if she does. My friend, you’ll help me in this thing—for my sake—that’s why you’re here—I mightn’t be able alone. If you flinch, I’ll kill you. Do you understand that? And if I have to kill you, I’ll kill her—and then I reckon nobody’ll ever know much about who done this business.”\n“Well, if it’s got to be done, let’s get at it. The quicker the better—I’m all in a shiver.”\n“Do it now? And company there? Look here—I’ll get suspicious of you, first thing you know. No—we’ll wait till the lights are out—there’s no hurry.",

The inmates were asleep, but it was a sleep that was set on a hair-trigger, on account of the exciting episode of the night. A call came from a window:\n“Who’s there!”\nHuck’s scared voice answered in a low tone:\n“Please let me in! It’s only Huck Finn!”\n“It’s a name that can open this door night or day, lad!—and welcome!”\nThese were strange words to the vagabond boy’s ears, and the pleasantest he had ever heard. He could not recollect that the closing word had ever been applied in his case before. The door was quickly unlocked, and he entered. Huck was given a seat and the old man and his brace of tall sons speedily dressed themselves.\n“Now, my boy, I hope you’re good and hungry, because breakfast will be ready as soon as the sun’s up, and we’ll have a piping hot one, too—make yourself easy about that! I and the boys hoped you’d turn up and stop here last night.”\n“I was awful scared,” said Huck, “and I run. I took out when the pistols went off, and I didn’t stop for three mile. I’ve come now becuz I wanted to know about it, you know; and I come before daylight becuz I didn’t want to run across them devils, even if they was dead.”\n“Well, poor chap, you do look as if you’d had a hard night of it—but there’s a bed here for you when you’ve had your breakfast. No, they ain’t dead, lad—we are sorry enough for that. You see we knew right where to put our hands on them, by your description; so we crept along on tiptoe till we got within fifteen feet of them—dark as a cellar that sumach path was—and just then I found I was going to sneeze. It was the meanest kind of luck! I tried to keep it back, but no use—’twas bound to come, and it did come! I was in the lead with my pistol raised, and when the sneeze started those scoundrels a-rustling to get out of the path, I sung out, ‘Fire boys!’ and blazed away at the place where the rustling was. So did the boys. But they were off in a jiffy, those villains, and we after them, down through the woods. I judge we never touched them. They fired a shot apiece as they started, but their bullets whizzed by and didn’t do us any harm. As soon as we lost the sound of their feet we quit chasing, and went down and stirred up the constables. They got a posse together, and went off to guard the river bank, and as soon as it is light the sheriff and a gang are going to beat up the woods. My boys will be with them presently. I wish we had some sort of description of those rascals—’twould help a good deal. But you couldn’t see what they were like, in the dark, lad, I suppose?”\n“Oh yes; I saw them downtown and follered them.”\n“Splendid! Describe them—describe them, my boy!”\n“One’s the old deaf and dumb Spaniard that’s ben around here once or twice, and t’other’s a mean-looking, ragged—”\n“That’s enough, lad, we know the men! Happened on them in the woods back of the widow’s one day, and they slunk away. Off with you, boys, and tell the sheriff—get your breakfast tomorrow morning!”",

But why don’t you want it known?”\nHuck would not explain, further than to say that he already knew too much about one of those men and would not have the man know that he knew anything against him for the whole world—he would be killed for knowing it, sure.\nThe old man promised secrecy once more, and said:\n“How did you come to follow these fellows, lad? Were they looking suspicious?”\nHuck was silent while he framed a duly cautious reply. Then he said:\n“Well, you see, I’m a kind of a hard lot,—least everybody says so, and I don’t see nothing agin it—and sometimes I can’t sleep much, on account of thinking about it and sort of trying to strike out a new way of doing. That was the way of it last night. I couldn’t sleep, and so I come along upstreet ’bout midnight, a-turning it all over, and when I got to that old shackly brick store by the Temperance Tavern, I backed up agin the wall to have another think. Well, just then along comes these two chaps slipping along close by me, with something under their arm, and I reckoned they’d stole it. One was a-smoking, and t’other one wanted a light; so they stopped right before me and the cigars lit up their faces and I see that the big one was the deaf and dumb Spaniard, by his white whiskers and the patch on his eye, and t’other one was a rusty, ragged-looking devil.”\n“Could you see the rags by the light of the cigars?”\nThis staggered Huck for a moment. Then he said:\n“Well, I don’t know—but somehow it seems as if I did.”\n“Then they went on, and you—”\n“Follered ’em—yes. That was it. I wanted to see what was up—they sneaked along so. I dogged ’em to the widder’s stile, and stood in the dark and heard the ragged one beg for the widder, and the Spaniard swear he’d spile her looks just as I told you and your two—”\n“What! The deaf and dumb man said all that!”\nHuck had made another terrible mistake! He was trying his best to keep the old man from getting the faintest hint of who the Spaniard might be, and yet his tongue seemed determined to get him into trouble in spite of all he could do. He made several efforts to creep out of his scrape, but the old man’s eye was upon him and he made blunder after blunder. Presently the Welshman said:\n“My boy, don’t be afraid of me. I wouldn’t hurt a hair of your head for all the world. No—I’d protect you—I’d protect you. This Spaniard is not deaf and dumb; you’ve let that slip without intending it; you can’t cover that up now. You know something about that Spaniard that you want to keep dark. Now trust me—tell me what it is, and trust me—I won’t betray you.”\nHuck looked into the old man’s honest eyes a moment, then bent over and whispered in his ear:\n“’Tain’t a Spaniard—it’s Injun Joe!”\nThe Welshman almost jumped out of his chair. In a moment he said:\n“It’s all plain enough, now. When you talked about notching ears and slitting noses I judged that that was your own embellishment, because white men don’t take that sort of revenge. But an Injun!

He said:\n\n“Oh, please don’t tell anybody what I done! The widow knows, and that’s enough. I don’t want no trouble with that other chap—he’d kill me, sure.”\n\n“I see,” said the Welshman. “I’ll keep your secret, but you’ll have to come with me and get a good breakfast.”\n\nLater, after breakfast, the Welshman said: “Now, my boy, you mustn’t be afraid of me. I wouldn’t hurt a hair of your head for all the world. So, tell me all about this. How did you come to be in such a place?”\n\nHuck began, a little hesitantly. “Well, you see, I can’t sleep much, nights, and so I was just prowling around, about midnight, and I happened to be down by the old Temperance Tavern, and I see two men come out of the alley. I hid, and when they was gone by, I followed ’em.”\n\n“Where did they go?”\n\n“Up the hill to the widow’s stile. I hid in the buckthorn bushes and listened. They was going to hurt her.”\n\n“How’d you see them? It was pretty dark.”\n\n“I know. But they lit a cigar, and I saw their faces.”\n\n“And you heard what they said?”\n\n“Yes. They was talking about how they was going to slit her ears and notch her nose.”\n\n“Well, that was a bad business. But you see, you should have come for help right away.”\n\n“I would’ve, but I was scared. And besides, the deaf and dumb Spaniard, he—” Huck stopped, confused.\n\n“What? The deaf and dumb man said something?”\n\n“Oh, no, sir, I—I mean the other one did.”\n\nThe Welshman looked at Huck with a kindly eye. “My boy, there’s something you’re holding back. You can trust me. What about the Spaniard?”\n\nHuck looked around nervously, as if to be sure no one else could hear. He leaned in close and whispered in the Welshman’s ear:\n\n“It ain’t a Spaniard—it’s Injun Joe.”\n\nThe Welshman started. “Injun Joe! By the great Caesar’s ghost, that’s it! That’s what a body might look for. It",

His eyes were staring wide, now, and his breath suspended—waiting for the answer. The Welshman started—stared in return—three seconds—five seconds—ten—then replied:\n“Of burglar’s tools. Why, what’s the matter with you?”\nHuck sank back, panting gently, but deeply, unutterably grateful. The Welshman eyed him gravely, curiously—and presently said:\n“Yes, burglar’s tools. That appears to relieve you a good deal. But what did give you that turn? What were you expecting we’d found?”\nHuck was in a close place—the inquiring eye was upon him—he would have given anything for material for a plausible answer—nothing suggested itself—the inquiring eye was boring deeper and deeper—a senseless reply offered—there was no time to weigh it, so at a venture he uttered it—feebly:\n“Sunday-school books, maybe.”\nPoor Huck was too distressed to smile, but the old man laughed loud and joyously, shook up the details of his anatomy from head to foot, and ended by saying that such a laugh was money in a-man’s pocket, because it cut down the doctor’s bill like everything. Then he added:\n“Poor old chap, you’re white and jaded—you ain’t well a bit—no wonder you’re a little flighty and off your balance. But you’ll come out of it. Rest and sleep will fetch you out all right, I hope.”\nHuck was irritated to think he had been such a goose and betrayed such a suspicious excitement, for he had dropped the idea that the parcel brought from the tavern was the treasure, as soon as he had heard the talk at the widow’s stile. He had only thought it was not the treasure, however—he had not known that it wasn’t—and so the suggestion of a captured bundle was too much for his self-possession. But on the whole he felt glad the little episode had happened, for now he knew beyond all question that that bundle was not the bundle, and so his mind was at rest and exceedingly comfortable.

The Welshman admitted several ladies and gentlemen, among them the Widow Douglas, and noticed that groups of citizens were climbing up the hill—to stare at the stile. So the news had spread. The Welshman had to tell the story of the night to the visitors. The widow’s gratitude for her preservation was outspoken.\n“Don’t say a word about it, madam. There’s another that you’re more beholden to than you are to me and my boys, maybe, but he don’t allow me to tell his name. We wouldn’t have been there but for him.”\nOf course this excited a curiosity so vast that it almost belittled the main matter—but the Welshman allowed it to eat into the vitals of his visitors, and through them be transmitted to the whole town, for he refused to part with his secret. When all else had been learned, the widow said:\n“I went to sleep reading in bed and slept straight through all that noise. Why didn’t you come and wake me?”\n“We judged it warn’t worth while. Those fellows warn’t likely to come again—they hadn’t any tools left to work with, and what was the use of waking you up and scaring you to death? My three negro men stood guard at your house all the rest of the night. They’ve just come back.”\nMore visitors came, and the story had to be told and retold for a couple of hours more.\nThere was no Sabbath-school during day-school vacation, but everybody was early at church. The stirring event was well canvassed. News came that not a sign of the two villains had been yet discovered. When the sermon was finished, Judge Thatcher’s wife dropped alongside of Mrs. Harper as she moved down the aisle with the crowd and said:\n“Is my Becky going to sleep all day? I just expected she would be tired to death.”\n“Your Becky?”\n“Yes,” with a startled look—“didn’t she stay with you last night?”\n“Why, no.”\nMrs. Thatcher turned pale, and sank into a pew, just as Aunt Polly, talking briskly with a friend, passed by. Aunt Polly said:\n“Goodmorning, Mrs. Thatcher. Goodmorning, Mrs. Harper. I’ve got a boy that’s turned up missing. I reckon my Tom stayed at your house last night—one of you. And now he’s afraid to come to church. I’ve got to settle with him.”\nMrs. Thatcher shook her head feebly and turned paler than ever.\n“He didn’t stay with us,” said Mrs. Harper, beginning to look uneasy. A marked anxiety came into Aunt Polly’s face.\n“Joe Harper, have you seen my Tom this morning?”\n“No’m.”\n“When did you see him last?”\nJoe tried to remember, but was not sure he could say. The people had stopped moving out of church. Whispers passed along, and a boding uneasiness took possession of every countenance. Children were anxiously questioned, and young teachers. They all said they had not noticed whether Tom and Becky were on board the ferryboat on the homeward trip; it was dark; no one thought of inquiring if any one was missing. One young man finally blurted out his fear that they were still in the cave! Mrs. Thatcher swooned away. Aunt Polly fell to crying and wringing her hands.",

All the tedious night the town waited for news; but when the morning dawned at last, all the word that came was, “Send more candles—and send food.” Mrs. Thatcher was almost crazed; and Aunt Polly, also. Judge Thatcher sent messages of hope and encouragement from the cave, but they conveyed no real cheer.\nThe old Welshman came home toward daylight, spattered with candle-grease, smeared with clay, and almost worn out. He found Huck still in the bed that had been provided for him, and delirious with fever. The physicians were all at the cave, so the Widow Douglas came and took charge of the patient. She said she would do her best by him, because, whether he was good, bad, or indifferent, he was the Lord’s, and nothing that was the Lord’s was a thing to be neglected. The Welshman said Huck had good spots in him, and the widow said:\n“You can depend on it. That’s the Lord’s mark. He don’t leave it off. He never does. Puts it somewhere on every creature that comes from his hands.”\nEarly in the forenoon parties of jaded men began to straggle into the village, but the strongest of the citizens continued searching. All the news that could be gained was that remotenesses of the cavern were being ransacked that had never been visited before; that every corner and crevice was going to be thoroughly searched; that wherever one wandered through the maze of passages, lights were to be seen flitting hither and thither in the distance, and shoutings and pistol-shots sent their hollow reverberations to the ear down the sombre aisles. In one place, far from the section usually traversed by tourists, the names “BECKY & TOM” had been found traced upon the rocky wall with candle-smoke, and near at hand a grease-soiled bit of ribbon. Mrs. Thatcher recognized the ribbon and cried over it. She said it was the last relic she should ever have of her child; and that no other memorial of her could ever be so precious, because this one parted latest from the living body before the awful death came. Some said that now and then, in the cave, a far-away speck of light would glimmer, and then a glorious shout would burst forth and a score of men go trooping down the echoing aisle—and then a sickening disappointment always followed; the children were not there; it was only a searcher’s light.",

                "refinement_prompt": "IMPROVEMENT GUIDANCE:\n1. MAJOR STRUCTURAL ISSUES:\n- The completion introduces invented scenes and events early on, such as references to the age and infirmity being left behind, women leaving homes untenanted, and specific commentary about Judge Thatcher's house and Becky's grief, which are not present in the original.\n- There is an invented subplot about Injun Joe being seen, a detective and posse, and a procession to the graveyard, including Tom's emotional reaction to seeing a murdered man. These events do not occur in the original passage and disrupt the narrative focus.\n- The completion omits a significant portion of the original's middle and end, particularly the detailed description of the search efforts in the cave, the discovery of the ribbon, Mrs. Thatcher's reaction, and the recurring disappointments during the search.\n\n2. MISSING ELEMENTS:\n- The completion lacks the original's detailed account of the town's emotional state throughout the afternoon and night, including the specific actions and emotional support provided by the women to Aunt Polly and Mrs. Thatcher.\n- There is no mention of the message received in the morning about candles and food, nor the emotional state of Mrs. Thatcher and Aunt Polly at that time.\n- The description of the searchers' return, the ongoing search in the cave, and the specific discoveries (such as the names on the wall and the ribbon) are missing.\n- The recurring false hopes and disappointments experienced by the searchers in the cave are not included.\n\n3. INACCURATE ELEMENTS:\n- The sequence of events is disrupted by the insertion of unrelated invented scenes, such as the graveyard procession and Tom's personal reactions, which do not align with the original timeline.\n- The completion inaccurately attributes actions and emotional responses, such as the generalization about the women and the invented dialogue about Judge Thatcher's house.\n- The transition between the search efforts and the care for Huck is less clear and omits the context provided in the original about the physicians' absence and the Widow Douglas's reasoning for caring for Huck.\n- The completion ends abruptly and does not cover the latter part of the original passage, including the ongoing search and the emotional impact of the discoveries in the cave."

You are very, very sick!”\nThen nothing but liquor had been found; there would have been a great powwow if it had been the gold. So the treasure was gone forever—gone forever! But what could she be crying about? Curious that she should cry.\nThese thoughts worked their dim way through Huck’s mind, and under the weariness they gave him he fell asleep. The widow said to herself:\n“There—he’s asleep, poor wreck. Tom Sawyer find it! Pity but somebody could find Tom Sawyer! Ah, there ain’t many left, now, that’s got hope enough, or strength enough, either, to go on searching.”",

Still drifting along and talking, they scarcely noticed that they were now in a part of the cave whose walls were not frescoed. They smoked their own names under an overhanging shelf and moved on. Presently they came to a place where a little stream of water, trickling over a ledge and carrying a limestone sediment with it, had, in the slow-dragging ages, formed a laced and ruffled Niagara in gleaming and imperishable stone.

In one place they found a spacious cavern, from whose ceiling depended a multitude of shining stalactites of the length and circumference of a man’s leg; they walked all about it, wondering and admiring, and presently left it by one of the numerous passages that opened into it. This shortly brought them to a bewitching spring, whose basin was incrusted with a frostwork of glittering crystals; it was in the midst of a cavern whose walls were supported by many fantastic pillars which had been formed by the joining of great stalactites and stalagmites together, the result of the ceaseless water-drip of centuries. Under the roof vast knots of bats had packed themselves together, thousands in a bunch; the lights disturbed the creatures and they came flocking down by hundreds, squeaking and darting furiously at the candles. Tom knew their ways and the danger of this sort of conduct. He seized Becky’s hand and hurried her into the first corridor that offered; and none too soon, for a bat struck Becky’s light out with its wing while she was passing out of the cavern. The bats chased the children a good distance; but the fugitives plunged into every new passage that offered, and at last got rid of the perilous things. Tom found a subterranean lake, shortly, which stretched its dim length away until its shape was lost in the shadows. He wanted to explore its borders, but concluded that it would be best to sit down and rest awhile, first. Now, for the first time, the deep stillness of the place laid a clammy hand upon the spirits of the children. Becky said:\n“Why, I didn’t notice, but it seems ever so long since I heard any of the others.”\n“Come to think, Becky, we are away down below them—and I don’t know how far away north, or south, or east, or whichever it is. We couldn’t hear them here.”\nBecky grew apprehensive.\n“I wonder how long we’ve been down here, Tom? We better start back.”\n“Yes, I reckon we better. P’raps we better.”\n“Can you find the way, Tom? It’s all a mixed-up crookedness to me.”\n“I reckon I could find it—but then the bats. If they put our candles out it will be an awful fix. Let’s try some other way, so as not to go through there.”\n“Well. But I hope we won’t get lost. It would be so awful!” and the girl shuddered at the thought of the dreadful possibilities.",

This ain’t the one, but we’ll come to it right away!”\nBut he felt less and less hopeful with each failure, and presently began to turn off into diverging avenues at sheer random, in desperate hope of finding the one that was wanted. He still said it was “all right,” but there was such a leaden dread at his heart that the words had lost their ring and sounded just as if he had said, “All is lost!” Becky clung to his side in an anguish of fear, and tried hard to keep back the tears, but they would come. At last she said:\n“Oh, Tom, never mind the bats, let’s go back that way! We seem to get worse and worse off all the time.”\n“Listen!” said he.\nProfound silence; silence so deep that even their breathings were conspicuous in the hush. Tom shouted. The call went echoing down the empty aisles and died out in the distance in a faint sound that resembled a ripple of mocking laughter.\n“Oh, don’t do it again, Tom, it is too horrid,” said Becky.\n“It is horrid, but I better, Becky; they might hear us, you know,” and he shouted again.\nThe “might” was even a chillier horror than the ghostly laughter, it so confessed a perishing hope. The children stood still and listened; but there was no result. Tom turned upon the back track at once, and hurried his steps. It was but a little while before a certain indecision in his manner revealed another fearful fact to Becky—he could not find his way back!\n“Oh, Tom, you didn’t make any marks!”\n“Becky, I was such a fool! Such a fool! I never thought we might want to come back! No—I can’t find the way. It’s all mixed up.”\n“Tom, Tom, we’re lost! we’re lost! We never can get out of this awful place! Oh, why did we ever leave the others!”\nShe sank to the ground and burst into such a frenzy of crying that Tom was appalled with the idea that she might die, or lose her reason. He sat down by her and put his arms around her; she buried her face in his bosom, she clung to him, she poured out her terrors, her unavailing regrets, and the far echoes turned them all to jeering laughter. Tom begged her to pluck up hope again, and she said she could not. He fell to blaming and abusing himself for getting her into this miserable situation; this had a better effect. She said she would try to hope again, she would get up and follow wherever he might lead if only he would not talk like that any more. For he was no more to blame than she, she said.",

This economy meant so much! Words were not needed. Becky understood, and her hope died again. She knew that Tom had a whole candle and three or four pieces in his pockets—yet he must economize.\nBy-and-by, fatigue began to assert its claims; the children tried to pay attention, for it was dreadful to think of sitting down when time was grown to be so precious, moving, in some direction, in any direction, was at least progress and might bear fruit; but to sit down was to invite death and shorten its pursuit.\nAt last Becky’s frail limbs refused to carry her farther. She sat down. Tom rested with her, and they talked of home, and the friends there, and the comfortable beds and, above all, the light! Becky cried, and Tom tried to think of some way of comforting her, but all his encouragements were grown thread-bare with use, and sounded like sarcasms. Fatigue bore so heavily upon Becky that she drowsed off to sleep. Tom was grateful. He sat looking into her drawn face and saw it grow smooth and natural under the influence of pleasant dreams; and by-and-by a smile dawned and rested there. The peaceful face reflected somewhat of peace and healing into his own spirit, and his thoughts wandered away to bygone times and dreamy memories. While he was deep in his musings, Becky woke up with a breezy little laugh—but it was stricken dead upon her lips, and a groan followed it.\n“Oh, how could I sleep! I wish I never, never had waked! No! No, I don’t, Tom! Don’t look so! I won’t say it again.”\n“I’m glad you’ve slept, Becky; you’ll feel rested, now, and we’ll find the way out.”\n“We can try, Tom; but I’ve seen such a beautiful country in my dream.

They found one presently, and Tom said it was time to rest again. Both were cruelly tired, yet Becky said she thought she could go a little farther. She was surprised to hear Tom dissent. She could not understand it. They sat down, and Tom fastened his candle to the wall in front of them with some clay. Thought was soon busy; nothing was said for some time.

I hope they are.”\n“When would they miss us, Tom?”\n“When they get back to the boat, I reckon.”\n“Tom, it might be dark then—would they notice we hadn’t come?”\n“I don’t know.

All that they knew was, that after what seemed a mighty stretch of time, both awoke out of a dead stupor of sleep and resumed their miseries. Tom said it might be Sunday, now—maybe Monday. He tried to get Becky to talk, but her sorrows were too oppressive, all her hopes were gone. Tom said that they must have been missed long ago, and no doubt the search was going on. He would shout, and maybe some one would come. He tried it; but in the darkness the distant echoes sounded so hideously that he tried it no more.\\n\\nThe hours wasted away, and hunger came to torment the captives again. A portion of Tom’s half of the “wedding-cake” was left; they divided and ate it. But it seemed only to be a aggravation of the hunger, rather than a relief.\\n\\nPresently Tom said:\\n\\n“Sh! Did you hear that?”\\n\\nBoth held their breath and listened. There was a sound like the faintest, far-off shout. Instantly Tom answered it, and, leading Becky by the hand, started groping down the corridor in its direction. Presently he listened again; the sound was repeated, and apparently was a little nearer.\\n\\n“It’s them!” said Tom. “They’re coming! Come along, Becky—we’re all right now!”\\n\\nThe joy of the prisoners was almost overwhelming. Their speed was slow, however, because pitfalls were somewhat common, and had to be guarded against. They shortly came to one, and had to stop. It might be three feet deep, it might be a hundred—there was no passing it, at any rate. Tom got down on his breast and reached as far down as he could. No bottom. They must stay there and wait until the searchers came. They listened; evidently the distant shoutings were growing more distant! a moment or two more and they had gone altogether. The heart-sinking misery of it! Tom shouted, until he was hoarse, but it was of no use. He talked hopefully to Becky; but an age of anxious waiting passed and no sounds came again.\"\n}\n```",

Tom Sawyer was in the skiff that bore Judge Thatcher.\nWhen the cave door was unlocked, a sorrowful sight presented itself in the dim twilight of the place. Injun Joe lay stretched upon the ground, dead, with his face close to the crack of the door, as if his longing eyes had been fixed, to the latest moment, upon the light and the cheer of the free world outside. Tom was touched, for he knew by his own experience how this wretch had suffered. His pity was moved, but nevertheless he felt an abounding sense of relief and security, now, which revealed to him in a degree which he had not fully appreciated before how vast a weight of dread had been lying upon him since the day he lifted his voice against this bloody-minded outcast.\nInjun Joe’s bowie-knife lay close by, its blade broken in two. The great foundation-beam of the door had been chipped and hacked through, with tedious labor; useless labor, too, it was, for the native rock formed a sill outside it, and upon that stubborn material the knife had wrought no effect; the only damage done was to the knife itself. But if there had been no stony obstruction there the labor would have been useless still, for if the beam had been wholly cut away Injun Joe could not have squeezed his body under the door, and he knew it. So he had only hacked that place in order to be doing something—in order to pass the weary time—in order to employ his tortured faculties. Ordinarily one could find half a dozen bits of candle stuck around in the crevices of this vestibule, left there by tourists; but there were none now. The prisoner had searched them out and eaten them. He had also contrived to catch a few bats, and these, also, he had eaten, leaving only their claws. The poor unfortunate had starved to death. In one place, near at hand, a stalagmite had been slowly growing up from the ground for ages, builded by the water-drip from a stalactite overhead. The captive had broken off the stalagmite, and upon the stump had placed a stone, wherein he had scooped a shallow hollow to catch the precious drop that fell once in every three minutes with the dreary regularity of a clock-tick—a dessertspoonful once in four and twenty hours. That drop was falling when the Pyramids were new; when Troy fell; when the foundations of Rome were laid; when Christ was crucified; when the Conqueror created the British empire; when Columbus sailed; when the massacre at Lexington was “news.”\nIt is falling now; it will still be falling when all these things shall have sunk down the afternoon of history, and the twilight of tradition, and been swallowed up in the thick night of oblivion. Has everything a purpose and a mission? Did this drop fall patiently during five thousand years to be ready for this flitting human insect’s need? and has it another important object to accomplish ten thousand years to come? No matter. It is many and many a year since the hapless half-breed scooped out the stone to catch the priceless drops, but to this day the tourist stares longest at that pathetic stone and that slow-dropping water when he comes to see the wonders of McDougal’s cave. Injun Joe’s cup stands first in the list of the cavern’s marvels; even “Aladdin’s Palace” cannot rival it.",

Don’t you remember you was to watch there that night?”\n“Oh yes! Why, it seems ’bout a year ago. It was that very night that I follered Injun Joe to the widder’s.”\n“You followed him?”\n“Yes—but you keep mum. I reckon Injun Joe’s left friends behind him, and I don’t want ’em souring on me and doing me mean tricks. If it hadn’t ben for me he’d be down in Texas now, all right.”\nThen Huck told his entire adventure in confidence to Tom, who had only heard of the Welshman’s part of it before.\n“Well,” said Huck, presently, coming back to the main question, “whoever nipped the whiskey in No. 2, nipped the money, too, I reckon—anyways it’s a goner for us, Tom.”\n“Huck, that money wasn’t ever in No. 2!”\n“What!” Huck searched his comrade’s face keenly. “Tom, have you got on the track of that money again?”\n“Huck, it’s in the cave!”\nHuck’s eyes blazed.\n“Say it again, Tom.”\n“The money’s in the cave!”\n“Tom—honest injun, now—is it fun, or earnest?”\n“Earnest, Huck—just as earnest as ever I was in my life.

Hive them in the cave till they raise a ransom.”\n“What’s a ransom?”\n“Money. You make them raise all they can, off’n their friends; and after you’ve kept them a year, if it ain’t raised then you kill them. That’s the general way. Only you don’t kill the women. You shut up the women, but you don’t kill them. They’re always beautiful and rich, and awfully scared. You take their watches and things, but you always take your hat off and talk polite. They ain’t anybody as polite as robbers—you’ll see that in any book. Well, the women get to loving you, and after they’ve been in the cave a week or two weeks they stop crying and after that you couldn’t get them to leave. If you drove them out they’d turn right around and come back. It’s so in all the books.”\n“Why, it’s real bully, Tom.

I know the ways of ghosts, and so do you.”\nTom began to fear that Huck was right. Misgivings gathered in his mind. But presently an idea occurred to him—\n“Lookyhere, Huck, what fools we’re making of ourselves! Injun Joe’s ghost ain’t a going to come around where there’s a cross!”\nThe point was well taken.

But there was no moneybox. The lads searched and researched this place, but in vain. Tom said:\n“He said under the cross. Well, this comes nearest to being under the cross. It can’t be under the rock itself, because that sets solid on the ground.”\nThey searched everywhere once more, and then sat down discouraged. Huck could suggest nothing. By-and-by Tom said:\n“Lookyhere, Huck, there’s footprints and some candle-grease on the clay about one side of this rock, but not on the other sides. Now, what’s that for? I bet you the money is under the rock. I’m going to dig in the clay.”\n“That ain’t no bad notion, Tom!” said Huck with animation.\nTom’s “real Barlow” was out at once, and he had not dug four inches before he struck wood.\n“Hey, Huck!—you hear that?”\nHuck began to dig and scratch now. Some boards were soon uncovered and removed. They had concealed a natural chasm which led under the rock. Tom got into this and held his candle as far under the rock as he could, but said he could not see to the end of the rift. He proposed to explore. He stooped and passed under; the narrow way descended gradually. He followed its winding course, first to the right, then to the left, Huck at his heels.

Got bricks in it?—or old metal?”\n“Old metal,” said Tom.\n“I judged so; the boys in this town will take more trouble and fool away more time hunting up six bits’ worth of old iron to sell to the foundry than they would to make twice the money at regular work. But that’s human nature—hurry along, hurry along!”\nThe boys wanted to know what the hurry was about.\n“Never mind; you’ll see, when we get to the Widow Douglas’.”\nHuck said with some apprehension—for he was long used to being falsely accused:\n“Mr. Jones, we haven’t been doing nothing.”\nThe Welshman laughed.\n“Well, I don’t know, Huck, my boy. I don’t know about that. Ain’t you and the widow good friends?”\n“Yes. Well, she’s ben good friends to me, anyway.”\n“All right, then. What do you want to be afraid for?”\nThis question was not entirely answered in Huck’s slow mind before he found himself pushed, along with Tom, into Mrs. Douglas’ drawing-room.

The Thatchers were there, the Harpers, the Rogerses, Aunt Polly, Sid, Mary, the minister, the editor, and a great many more, and all dressed in their best. The widow received the boys as heartily as any one could well receive two such looking beings. They were covered with clay and candle-grease. Aunt Polly blushed crimson with humiliation, and frowned and shook her head at Tom. Nobody suffered half as much as the two boys did, however. Mr. Jones said:\n“Tom wasn’t at home, yet, so I gave him up; but I stumbled on him and Huck right at my door, and so I just brought them along in a hurry.”\n“And you did just right,” said the widow. “Come with me, boys.”\nShe took them to a bedchamber and said:\n“Now wash and dress yourselves. Here are two new suits of clothes—shirts, socks, everything complete. They’re Huck’s—no, no thanks, Huck—Mr. Jones bought one and I the other. But they’ll fit both of you. Get into them.

Every time a twig snapped, he started; and when the wind sighed through the trees, it sent a cold shiver through him. He was in the deepest shadow of the elms, and the starlight was blotted out. He could not see his hand before him. He was so close to the treasure that he could have touched it with his foot, and the thought of its vastness was a suffocating presence. What if somebody came? What if the ghost of the murdered man should now appear? He clutched the rusty pick with a desperate grip and held his breath.\n\nThe minutes dragged by, each one seeming an hour. The silence grew more and more oppressive. Huck's imagination began to run riot. He pictured Injun Joe's spectral form rising from the very spot where the box lay buried. He saw his baleful eyes glowing in the dark. He fancied he heard a stealthy footstep approaching. His heart hammered against his ribs, and a cold sweat broke out on his forehead. He was on the point of abandoning the treasure and fleeing in terror when a faint, distant rattle broke the stillness.\n\nIt grew nearer, and Huck's heart gave a great leap of relief. It was the wagon! Tom was coming. In another moment, the little vehicle, a mere toy, appeared, with Tom pulling it manfully. It was a rickety affair, but it was better than nothing. They did not speak a word. The business was too serious for speech. They lifted the heavy box out of the hole, grunting with the effort. It was all they could do to hoist it into the wagon. The old springs groaned and settled down under the immense weight.\n\nThen they started on their journey, Tom pulling and Huck pushing from behind. The little wagon creaked and swayed, and every jolt sent a pang of fear through them. They kept to the darkest alleys, avoiding the main streets. The town was asleep, and not a soul was stirring. The silence was broken only by the squeaking of the wheels and their own labored breathing. It seemed an eternity before they reached the widow's place.\n\nThe woodshed was at the back of the garden. They crept to it like thieves, their hearts in their mouths. The door was not locked. They slipped inside, into the blackness. Tom felt his way to the ladder and ascended to the loft, with Huck close at his heels. They deposited their precious burden in a dark corner, piling old sacks and discarded horse-blankets over it. It was safe at last.\n\n\"There,\" whispered Tom. \"Now we can sleep. I'll come for you in the morning.\"\n\nThey shook hands, a pact of silence and fellowship, and Huck slipped away to his hogshead, while Tom crept back to his bed, his mind a whirlwind of glorious plans."

Everybody knows—the widow, too, for all she tries to let on she don’t. Mr. Jones was bound Huck should be here—couldn’t get along with his grand secret without Huck, you know!”\n“Secret about what, Sid?”\n“About Huck tracking the robbers to the widow’s. I reckon Mr. Jones was going to make a grand time over his surprise, but I bet you it will drop pretty flat.”\nSid chuckled in a very contented and satisfied way.\n“Sid, was it you that told?”\n“Oh, never mind who it was. Somebody told—that’s enough.”\n“Sid, there’s only one person in this town mean enough to do that, and that’s you. If you had been in Huck’s place you’d ’a’ sneaked down the hill and never told anybody on the robbers. You can’t do any but mean things, and you can’t bear to see anybody praised for doing good ones. There—no thanks, as the widow says”—and Tom cuffed Sid’s ears and helped him to the door with several kicks. “Now go and tell auntie if you dare—and tomorrow you’ll catch it!”",

            "Huck found this description highly exciting and impressive.",

            "Tom further specified that the oath must be sworn upon a coffin and signed with blood.",
