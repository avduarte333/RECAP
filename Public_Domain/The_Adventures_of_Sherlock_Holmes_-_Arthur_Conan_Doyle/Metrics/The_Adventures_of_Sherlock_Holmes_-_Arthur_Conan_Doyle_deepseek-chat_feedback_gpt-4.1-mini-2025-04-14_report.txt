   "all the afternoon he sat in the stalls wrapped in the most perfect happiness gently waving his long thin fingers in time to the music while his gently smiling face and his languid dreamy eyes were as unlike those of holmes the sleuthhound holmes the relentless keenwitted readyhanded criminal agent as it was possible to conceive in his singular character the dual nature alternately asserted itself and his extreme exactness and astuteness represented as i have often thought the reaction against the poetic and contemplative mood which occasionally predominated in him the swing of his nature took him from extreme languor to devouring energy and as i knew well he was never so truly formidable as when for days on end he had been lounging in his armchair amid his improvisations and his blackletter editions then it was that the lust of the chase would suddenly come upon him and that his brilliant reasoning power would rise to the level of intuition until those who were unacquainted with his methods would look askance at him as on a man whose knowledge was not that of other mortals when i saw him that afternoon so enwrapped in the music at st james ’ s hall i felt that an evil time might be coming upon those whom he had set himself to hunt down “ you want to go home no doubt doctor ” he remarked as we emerged “ yes it would be as well ” “ and i have some business to do which will take some hours this business at coburg square is serious ” “ why serious ” “ a considerable crime is in contemplation i have every reason to believe that we shall be in time to stop it but today being saturday rather complicates matters i shall want your help tonight ” “ at what time ” “ ten will be early enough ” “ i shall be at baker street at ten ” “ very well and i say doctor there may be some little danger so kindly put your army revolver in your pocket ” he waved his hand turned on his heel and disappeared in an instant among the crowd i trust that i am not more dense than my neighbours but i was always oppressed with a sense of my own stupidity in my dealings with sherlock holmes here i had heard what he had heard i had seen what he had seen and yet from his words it was evident that he saw clearly not only what had happened but what was about to happen while to me the whole business was still confused and grotesque as i drove home to my house in kensington i thought over it all from the extraordinary story of the redheaded copier of the encyclopædia down to the visit to saxecoburg square and the ominous words with which he had parted from me what was this nocturnal expedition and why should i go armed where were we going and what were we to do i had the hint from holmes that this smoothfaced pawnbroker ’ s assistant was a formidable mana man who might play a deep game i tried to puzzle it out but gave it up in despair and set the matter aside until night should bring an explanation it was a quarterpast nine when i started from home and made my way across the park and so through oxford street to baker street two hansoms were standing at the door and as i entered the passage i heard the sound of voices from above on entering his room i found holmes in animated conversation with two men one of whom i recognised as peter jones the official police agent while the other was a long thin sadfaced man with a very shiny hat and oppressively respectable frockcoat “ ha our party is complete ” said holmes buttoning up his peajacket and taking his heavy hunting crop from the rack “ watson i think you know mr jones of scotland yard let me introduce you to mr merryweather who is to be our companion in tonight ’ s adventure ” “ we ’ re hunting in couples again doctor you see ” said jones in his consequential way “ our friend here is a wonderful man for starting a chase all he wants is an old dog to help him to do the running down ” “ i hope a wild goose may not prove to be the end of our chase ” observed mr merryweather gloomily “ you may place considerable confidence in mr holmes sir ” said the police agent loftily “ he has his own little methods which are if he won ’ t mind my saying so just a little too theoretical and fantastic but he has the makings of a detective in him it is not too much to say that once or twice as in that business of the sholto murder and the agra treasure he has been more nearly correct than the official force ” “ oh if you say so mr jones it is all right ” said the stranger with deference “ still i confess that i miss my rubber it is the first saturday night for sevenandtwenty years that i have not had my rubber ” “ i think you will find ” said sherlock holmes “ that you will play for a higher stake tonight than you have ever done yet and that the play will be more exciting for you mr merryweather the stake will be some £ 30000 and for you jones it will be the man upon whom you wish to lay your hands ” “ john clay the murderer thief smasher and forger he ’ s a young man mr merryweather but he is at the head of his profession and i would rather have my bracelets on him than on any criminal in london he ’ s a remarkable man is young john clay his grandfather was a royal duke and he himself has been to eton and oxford his brain is as cunning as his fingers and though we meet signs of him at every turn we never know where to find the man himself he ’ ll crack a crib in scotland one week and be raising money to build an orphanage in cornwall the next i ’ ve been on his track for years and have never set eyes on him yet ” “ i hope that i may have the pleasure of introducing you tonight i ’ ve had one or two little turns also with mr john clay and i agree with you that he is at the head of his profession it is past ten however and quite time that we started if you two will take the first hansom watson and i will follow in the second ” sherlock holmes was not very communicative during the long drive and lay back in the cab humming the tunes which he had heard in the afternoon we rattled through an endless labyrinth of gaslit streets until we emerged into farrington street “ we are close there now ” my friend remarked “ this fellow merryweather is a bank director and personally interested in the matter i thought it as well to have jones with us also he is not a bad fellow though an absolute imbecile in his profession he has one positive virtue he is as brave as a bulldog and as tenacious as a lobster if he gets his claws upon anyone here we are and they are waiting for us ” we had reached the same crowded thoroughfare in which we had found ourselves in the morning our cabs were dismissed and following the guidance of mr merryweather we passed down a narrow passage and through a side door which he opened for us within there was a small corridor which ended in a very massive iron gate this also was opened and led down a flight of winding stone steps which terminated at another formidable gate mr merryweather stopped to light a lantern and then conducted us down a dark earthsmelling passage and so after opening a third door into a huge vault or cellar which was piled all round with crates and massive boxes “ you are not very vulnerable from above ” holmes remarked as he held up the lantern and gazed about him “ nor from below ” said mr merryweather striking his stick upon the flags which lined the floor “ why dear me it sounds quite hollow ” he remarked looking up in surprise “ i must really ask you to be a little more quiet ” said holmes severely “ you have already imperilled the whole success of our expedition might i beg that you would have the goodness to sit down upon one of those boxes and not to interfere ” the solemn mr merryweather perched himself upon a crate with a very injured expression upon his face while holmes fell upon his knees upon the floor and with the lantern and a magnifying lens began to examine minutely the cracks between the stones a few seconds sufficed to satisfy him for he sprang to his feet again and put his glass in his pocket “ we have at least an hour before us ” he remarked “ for they can hardly take any steps until the good pawnbroker is safely in bed then they will not lose a minute for the sooner they do their work the longer time they will have for their escape we are at present doctoras no doubt you have divinedin the cellar of the city branch of one of the principal london banks mr merryweather is the chairman of directors and he will explain to you that there are reasons why the more daring criminals of london should take a considerable interest in this cellar at present ” “ it is our french gold ” whispered the director “ we have had several warnings that an attempt might be made upon it ” “ your french gold ” “ yes we had occasion some months ago to strengthen our resources and borrowed for that purpose 30000 napoleons from the bank of france it has become known that we have never had occasion to unpack the money and that it is still lying in our cellar the crate upon which i sit contains 2000 napoleons packed between layers of lead foil our reserve of bullion is much larger at present than is usually kept in a single branch office and the directors have had misgivings upon the subject ” “ which were very well justified ” observed holmes “ and now it is time that we arranged our little plans i expect that within an hour matters will come to a head in the meantime mr merryweather we must put the screen over that dark lantern ” “ and sit in the dark ” “ i am afraid so i had brought a pack of cards in my pocket and i thought that as we were a partie carrée you might have your rubber after all but i see that the enemy ’ s preparations have gone so far that we can not risk the presence of a light and first of all we must choose our positions these are daring men and though we shall take them at a disadvantage they may do us some harm unless we are careful i shall stand behind this crate and do you conceal yourselves behind those then when i flash a light upon them close in swiftly if they fire watson have no compunction about shooting them down ” i placed my revolver cocked upon the top of the wooden case behind which i crouched holmes shot the slide across the front of his lantern and left us in pitch darknesssuch an absolute darkness as i have never before experienced the smell of hot metal remained to assure us that the light was still there ready to flash out at a moment ’ s notice to me with my nerves worked up to a pitch of expectancy there was something depressing and subduing in the sudden gloom and in the cold dank air of the vault “ they have but one retreat ” whispered holmes “ that is back through the house into saxecoburg square i hope that you have done what i asked you jones ” “ i have an inspector and two officers waiting at the front door ” “ then we have stopped all the holes and now we must be silent and"

   "at nine o ’ clock lestrade called for us with the carriage and we set off for hatherley farm and the boscombe pool “ there is serious news this morning ” lestrade observed “ it is said that mr turner of the hall is so ill that his life is despaired of ” “ an elderly man i presume ” said holmes “ about sixty but his constitution has been shattered by his life abroad and he has been in failing health for some time this business has had a very bad effect upon him he was an old friend of mccarthy ’ s and i may add a great benefactor to him for i have learned that he gave him hatherley farm rent free ” “ indeed that is interesting ” said holmes “ oh yes in a hundred other ways he has helped him everybody about here speaks of his kindness to him ” “ really does it not strike you as a little singular that this mccarthy who appears to have had little of his own and to have been under such obligations to turner should still talk of marrying his son to turner ’ s daughter who is presumably heiress to the estate and that in such a very cocksure manner as if it were merely a case of a proposal and all else would follow it is the more strange since we know that turner himself was averse to the idea the daughter told us as much do you not deduce something from that ” “ we have got to the deductions and the inferences ” said lestrade winking at me “ i find it hard enough to tackle facts holmes without flying away after theories and fancies ” “ you are right ” said holmes demurely “ you do find it very hard to tackle the facts ” “ anyhow i have grasped one fact which you seem to find it difficult to get hold of ” replied lestrade with some warmth “ and that is ” “ that mccarthy senior met his death from mccarthy junior and that all theories to the contrary are the merest moonshine ” “ well moonshine is a brighter thing than fog ” said holmes laughing “ but i am very much mistaken if this is not hatherley farm upon the left ” “ yes that is it ” it was a widespread comfortablelooking building twostoried slateroofed with great yellow blotches of lichen upon the grey walls the drawn blinds and the smokeless chimneys however gave it a stricken look as though the weight of this horror still lay heavy upon it we called at the door when the maid at holmes ’ request showed us the boots which her master wore at the time of his death and also a pair of the son ’ s though not the pair which he had then had having measured these very carefully from seven or eight different points holmes desired to be led to the courtyard from which we all followed the winding track which led to boscombe pool sherlock holmes was transformed when he was hot upon such a scent as this men who had only known the quiet thinker and logician of baker street would have failed to recognise him his face flushed and darkened his brows were drawn into two hard black lines while his eyes shone out from beneath them with a steely glitter his face was bent downward his shoulders bowed his lips compressed and the veins stood out like whipcord in his long sinewy neck his nostrils seemed to dilate with a purely animal lust for the chase and his mind was so absolutely concentrated upon the matter before him that a question or remark fell unheeded upon his ears or at the most only provoked a quick impatient snarl in reply swiftly and silently he made his way along the track which ran through the meadows and so by way of the woods to the boscombe pool it was damp marshy ground as is all that district and there were marks of many feet both upon the path and amid the short grass which bounded it on either side sometimes holmes would hurry on sometimes stop dead and once he made quite a little detour into the meadow lestrade and i walked behind him the detective indifferent and contemptuous while i watched my friend with the interest which sprang from the conviction that every one of his actions was directed towards a definite end the boscombe pool which is a little reedgirt sheet of water some fifty yards across is situated at the boundary between the hatherley farm and the private park of the wealthy mr turner above the woods which lined it upon the farther side we could see the red jutting pinnacles which marked the site of the rich landowner ’ s dwelling on the hatherley side of the pool the woods grew very thick and there was a narrow belt of sodden grass twenty paces across between the edge of the trees and the reeds which lined the lake lestrade showed us the exact spot at which the body had been found and indeed so moist was the ground that i could plainly see the traces which had been left by the fall of the stricken man to holmes as i could see by his eager face and peering eyes very many other things were to be read upon the trampled grass he ran round like a dog who is picking up a scent and then turned upon my companion “ what did you go into the pool for ” he asked “ i fished about with a rake i thought there might be some weapon or other trace but how on earth ” “ oh tut tut i have no time that left foot of yours with its inward twist is all over the place a mole could trace it and there it vanishes among the reeds oh how simple it would all have been had i been here before they came like a herd of buffalo and wallowed all over it here is where the party with the lodgekeeper came and they have covered all tracks for six or eight feet round the body but here are three separate tracks of the same feet ” he drew out a lens and lay down upon his waterproof to have a better view talking all the time rather to himself than to us “ these are young mccarthy ’ s feet twice he was walking and once he ran swiftly so that the soles are deeply marked and the heels hardly visible that bears out his story he ran when he saw his father on the ground then here are the father ’ s feet as he paced up and down what is this then it is the buttend of the gun as the son stood listening and this ha ha what have we here tiptoes tiptoes square too quite unusual boots they come they go they come againof course that was for the cloak now where did they come from ” he ran up and down sometimes losing sometimes finding the track until we were well within the edge of the wood and under the shadow of a great beech the largest tree in the neighbourhood holmes traced his way to the farther side of this and lay down once more upon his face with a little cry of satisfaction for a long time he remained there turning over the leaves and dried sticks gathering up what seemed to me to be dust into an envelope and examining with his lens not only the ground but even the bark of the tree as far as he could reach a jagged stone was lying among the moss and this also he carefully examined and retained then he followed a pathway through the wood until he came to the high road where all traces were lost “ it has been a case of considerable interest ” he remarked returning to his natural manner “ i fancy that this grey house on the right must be the lodge i think that i will go in and have a word with moran and perhaps write a little note having done that we may drive back to our luncheon you may walk to the cab and i shall be with"

that purpose 30000 napoleons from the bank of france it has become known that we have never had occasion to unpack the money and that it is still lying in our cellar the crate upon which i sit contains 2000 napoleons packed between layers of lead foil our reserve of bullion is much larger at present than is usually kept in a single branch office and the directors have had misgivings upon the subject ” “ which were very well justified ” observed holmes “ and now it is time that we arranged our little plans i expect that within an hour matters will come to a head in the meantime mr merryweather we must put the screen over that dark lantern ” “ and sit in the dark ” “ i am afraid so i had brought a pack of cards in my pocket and i thought that as we were a partie carrée you might have your rubber after all but i see that the enemy ’ s preparations have gone so far that we can not risk the presence of a light and first of all we must choose our positions these are daring men and though we shall take them at a disadvantage they may do us some harm unless we are careful i shall stand behind this crate and do you conceal yourselves behind those then when i flash a light upon them close in swiftly if they fire watson have no compunction about shooting them down ” i placed my revolver cocked upon the top of the wooden case behind which i crouched holmes shot the slide across the front of his lantern and left us in pitch darknesssuch an absolute darkness as i have never before experienced the smell of hot metal remained to assure us that the light was still there ready to flash out at a moment ’ s notice to me with my nerves worked up to a pitch of expectancy there was something depressing and subduing in the sudden gloom and in the cold dank air of the vault “ they have but one retreat ” whispered holmes “ that is back through the house into saxecoburg square i hope that you have done what i asked you jones ” “ i have an inspector and two officers waiting at the front door ” “ then we have stopped all the holes and now we must be silent and wait ”"

   "and why does he pursue this unhappy family ” sherlock holmes closed his eyes and placed his elbows upon the arms of his chair with his fingertips together “ the ideal reasoner ” he remarked “ would when he had once been shown a single fact in all its bearings deduce from it not only all the chain of events which led up to it but also all the results which would follow from it as cuvier could correctly describe a whole animal by the contemplation of a single bone so the observer who has thoroughly understood one link in a series of incidents should be able to accurately state all the other ones both before and after we have not yet grasped the results which the reason alone can attain to problems may be solved in the study which have baffled all those who have sought a solution by the aid of their senses to carry the art however to its highest pitch it is necessary that the reasoner should be able to utilise all the facts which have come to his knowledge and this in itself implies as you will readily see a possession of all knowledge which even in these days of free education and encyclopædias is a somewhat rare accomplishment it is not so impossible however that a man should possess all knowledge which is likely to be useful to him in his work and this i have endeavoured in my case to do if i remember rightly you on one occasion in the early days of our friendship defined my limits in a very precise fashion ” “ yes ” i answered laughing “ it was a singular document philosophy astronomy and politics were marked at zero i remember botany variable geology profound as regards the mudstains from any region within fifty miles of town chemistry eccentric anatomy unsystematic sensational literature and crime records unique violinplayer boxer swordsman lawyer and selfpoisoner by cocaine and tobacco those i think were the main points of my analysis ” holmes grinned at the last item “ well ” he said “ i say now as i said then that a man should keep his little brainattic stocked with all the furniture that he is likely to use and the rest he can put away in the lumberroom of his library where he can get it if he wants it now for such a case as the one which has been submitted to us tonight we need certainly to muster all our resources kindly hand me down the letter k of the american encyclopædia which stands upon the shelf beside you thank you now let us consider the situation and see what may be deduced from it in the first place we may start with a strong presumption that colonel openshaw had some very strong reason for leaving america men at his time of life do not change all their habits and exchange willingly the charming climate of florida for the lonely life of an english provincial town his extreme love of solitude in england suggests the idea that he was in fear of someone or something so we may assume as a working hypothesis that it was fear of someone or something which drove him from america as to what it was he feared we can only deduce that by considering the formidable letters which were received by himself and his successors did you remark the postmarks of those letters ” “ the first was from pondicherry the second from dundee and the third from london ” “ from east london what do you deduce from that ” “ they are all seaports that the writer was on board of a ship ” “ excellent we have already a clue there can be no doubt that the probabilitythe strong probabilityis that the writer was on board of a ship and now let us consider another point in the case of pondicherry seven weeks elapsed between the threat and its fulfilment in dundee it was only some three or four days does that suggest anything ” “ a greater distance to travel ” “ but the letter had also a greater distance to come ” “ then i do not see the point ” “ there is at least a presumption that the vessel in which the man or men are is a sailingship it looks as if they always send their singular warning or token before them when starting upon their mission you see how quickly the deed followed the sign when it came from dundee if they had come from pondicherry in a steamer they would have arrived almost as soon as their letter but as a matter of fact seven weeks elapsed i think that those seven weeks represented the difference between the mailboat which brought the letter and the sailing vessel which brought the writer ” “ it is possible ” “ more than that it is probable and now you see the deadly urgency of this new case and why i urged young openshaw to caution the blow has always fallen at the end of the time which it would take the senders to travel the distance but this one comes from london and therefore we can not count upon delay ” “ good god ” i cried “ what can it mean this relentless persecution ” “ the papers which openshaw carried are obviously of vital importance to the person or persons in the sailingship i think that it is quite clear that there must be more than one of them a single man could not have carried out two deaths in such a way as to deceive a coroner ’ s jury there must have been several in it and they must have been men of resource and determination their papers they mean to have be the holder of them who it may in"
