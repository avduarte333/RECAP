   "two hours passed slowly away and then suddenly just at the stroke of eleven a single bright light shone out right in front of us “ that is our signal ” said holmes springing to his feet “ it comes from the middle window ” as we passed out he exchanged a few words with the landlord explaining that we were going on a late visit to an acquaintance and that it was possible that we might spend the night there a moment later we were out on the dark road a chill wind blowing in our faces and one yellow light twinkling in front of us through the gloom to guide us on our sombre errand there was little difficulty in entering the grounds for unrepaired breaches gaped in the old park wall making our way among the trees we reached the lawn crossed it and were about to enter through the window when out from a clump of laurel bushes there darted what seemed to be a hideous and distorted child who threw itself upon the grass with writhing limbs and then ran swiftly across the lawn into the darkness “ my god ” i whispered “ did you see it ” holmes was for the moment as startled as i his hand closed like a vice upon my wrist in his agitation then he broke into a low laugh and put his lips to my ear “ it is a nice household ” he murmured “ that is the baboon ” i had forgotten the strange pets which the doctor affected there was a cheetah too perhaps we might find it upon our shoulders at any moment i confess that i felt easier in my mind when after following holmes ’ example and slipping off my shoes i found myself inside the bedroom my companion noiselessly closed the shutters moved the lamp onto the table and cast his eyes round the room all was as we had seen it in the daytime then creeping up to me and making a trumpet of his hand he whispered into my ear again so gently that it was all that i could do to distinguish the words “ the least sound would be fatal to our plans ” i nodded to show that i had heard “ we must sit without light he would see it through the ventilator ” i nodded again “ do not go asleep your very life may depend upon it have your pistol ready in case we should need it i will sit on the side of the bed and you in that chair ” i took out my revolver and laid it on the corner of the table holmes had brought up a long thin cane and this he placed upon the bed beside him by it he laid the box of matches and the stump of a candle then he turned down the lamp and we were left in darkness how shall i ever forget that dreadful vigil i could not hear a sound not even the drawing of a breath and yet i knew that my companion sat openeyed within a few feet of me in the same state of nervous tension in which i was myself the shutters cut off the least ray of light and we waited in absolute darkness from outside came the occasional cry of a nightbird and once at our very window a long drawn catlike whine which told us that the cheetah was indeed at liberty far away we could hear the deep tones of the parish clock which boomed out every quarter of an hour how long they seemed those quarters twelve struck and one and two and three and still we sat waiting silently for whatever might befall suddenly there was the momentary gleam of a light up in the direction of the ventilator which vanished immediately but was succeeded by a strong smell of burning oil and heated metal someone in the next room had lit a darklantern i heard a gentle sound of movement and then all was silent once more though the smell grew stronger for half an hour i sat with straining ears then suddenly another sound became audiblea very gentle soothing sound like that of a small jet of steam escaping continually from a kettle the instant that we heard it holmes sprang from the bed struck a match and lashed furiously with his cane at the bellpull “ you see it watson ” he yelled “ you see it ” but i saw nothing at the moment when holmes struck the light i heard a low clear whistle but the sudden glare flashing into my weary eyes made it impossible for me to tell what it was at which my friend lashed so savagely i could however see that his face was deadly pale and filled with horror and loathing he had ceased to strike and was gazing up at the ventilator when suddenly there broke from the silence of the night the most horrible cry to which i have ever listened it swelled up louder and louder a hoarse yell of pain and fear and anger all mingled in the one dreadful shriek they say that away down in the village and even in the distant parsonage that cry raised the sleepers from their beds it struck cold to our hearts and i stood gazing at holmes and he at me until the last echoes of it had died away into the silence from which it rose “ what can it mean ” i gasped “ it means that it is all over ” holmes answered “ and perhaps after all it is for the best take your pistol and we will enter dr roylott ’ s room ” with a grave face he lit the lamp and led the way down the corridor twice he struck at the chamber door without any reply from within then he turned the handle and entered i at his heels with the cocked pistol in my hand it was a singular sight which met our eyes on the table stood a darklantern with the shutter half open throwing a brilliant beam of light upon the iron safe the door of which was ajar beside this table on the wooden chair sat dr grimesby roylott clad in a long grey dressinggown his bare ankles protruding beneath and his feet thrust into red heelless turkish slippers across his lap lay the short stock with the long lash which we had noticed during the day his chin was cocked upward and his eyes were fixed in a dreadful rigid stare at the corner of the ceiling round his brow he had a peculiar yellow band with brownish speckles which seemed to be bound tightly round his head as we entered he made neither sound nor motion “ the band the speckled band ” whispered holmes i took a step forward in an instant his strange headgear began to move and there reared itself from among his hair the squat diamondshaped head and puffed neck of a loathsome serpent “ it is a swamp adder ” cried holmes “ the deadliest snake in india he has died within ten seconds of being bitten violence does in truth recoil upon the violent and the schemer falls into the pit which he digs for another let us thrust this creature back into its den and we can then remove miss stoner to some place of shelter and let the county police know what has happened ” as he spoke he drew the dogwhip swiftly from the dead man ’ s lap and throwing the noose round the reptile ’ s neck he drew it from its horrid perch and carrying it at arm ’ s length threw it into the iron safe which he closed upon it such are the true facts of the death of dr grimesby roylott of stoke moran it is not necessary that i should prolong a narrative which has already run to too great a length by telling how we broke the sad news to the terrified girl how we conveyed her by the morning train to the care of her good aunt at harrow of how the slow process of official inquiry came to the conclusion that the doctor met his fate while indiscreetly playing with a dangerous pet the little which i had yet to learn of the case was told me by sherlock holmes as we travelled back next day “ i had ” said he “ come to an entirely erroneous conclusion which shows my dear watson how dangerous it always is to reason from insufficient data the presence of the gipsies and the use of the word ‘ band ’ which was used by the poor girl no doubt to explain the appearance which she had caught a hurried glimpse of by the light of her match were sufficient to put me upon an entirely wrong scent i can only claim the merit that i instantly reconsidered my position when however it became clear to me that whatever danger threatened an occupant of the room could not come either from the window or the door my attention was speedily drawn as i have already remarked to you to this ventilator and to the bellrope which hung down to the bed the discovery that this was a dummy and that the bed was clamped to the floor instantly gave rise to the suspicion that the rope was there as a bridge for something passing through the hole and coming to the bed the idea of a snake instantly occurred to me and when i coupled it with my knowledge that the doctor was furnished with a supply of creatures from india i felt that i was probably on the right track the idea of using a form of poison which could not possibly be discovered by any chemical test was just such a one as would occur to a clever and ruthless man who had had an eastern training the rapidity with which such a poison would take effect would also from his point of view be an advantage it would be a sharpeyed coroner indeed who could distinguish the two little dark punctures which would show where the poison fangs had done their work then i thought of the whistle of course he must recall the snake before the morning light revealed it to the victim he had trained it probably by the use of the milk which we saw to return to him when summoned he would put it through this ventilator at the hour that he thought best with the certainty that it would crawl down the rope and land on the bed it might or might not bite the occupant perhaps she might escape every night for a week but sooner or later she must fall a victim “ i had come to these conclusions before ever i had entered his room an inspection of his chair showed me that he had been in the habit of standing on it which of course would be necessary in order that he should reach the ventilator the sight of the safe the saucer of milk and the loop of whipcord were enough to finally dispel any doubts which may have remained the metallic clang heard by miss stoner was obviously caused by her stepfather hastily closing the door of his safe upon its terrible occupant having once made up my mind you know the steps which i took in order to put the matter to the proof i heard the creature hiss as i have no doubt that you did also and i instantly lit the light and attacked it ” “ with the result of driving it through the ventilator ” “ and also with the result of causing it to turn upon its master at the other"

   "holmes gently “ you had my note ” “ yes the lodgekeeper brought it up you said that you wished to see me here to avoid scandal ” “ i thought people would talk if i went to the hall ” “ and why did you wish to see me ” he looked across at my companion with despair in his weary eyes as though his question was already answered “ yes ” said holmes answering the look rather than the words “ it is so i know all about mccarthy ” the old man sank his face in his hands “ god help me ” he cried “ but i would not have let the young man come to harm i give you my word that i would have spoken out if it went against him at the assizes ” “ i am glad to hear you say so ” said holmes gravely “ i would have spoken now had it not been for my dear girl it would break her heartit will break her heart when she hears that i am arrested ” “ it may not come to that ” said holmes “ what ” “ i am no official agent i understand that it was your daughter who required my presence here and i am acting in her interests young mccarthy must be got off however ” “ i am a dying man ” said old turner “ i have had diabetes for years my doctor says it is a question whether i shall live a month yet i would rather die under my own roof than in a gaol ” holmes rose and sat down at the table with his pen in his hand and a bundle of paper before him “ just tell us the truth ” he said “ i shall jot down the facts you will sign it and watson here can witness it then i could produce your confession at the last extremity to save young mccarthy i promise you that i shall not use it unless it is absolutely needed ” “ it ’ s as well ” said the old man “ it ’ s a question whether i shall live to the assizes so it matters little to me but i should wish to spare alice the shock and now i will make the thing clear to you it has been a long time in the acting but will not take me long to tell “ you didn ’ t know this dead man mccarthy he was a devil incarnate i tell you that god keep you out of the clutches of such a man as he his grip has been upon me these twenty years and he has blasted my life i ’ ll tell you first how i came to be in his power “ it was in the early ’ 60 ’ s at the diggings i was a young chap then hotblooded and reckless ready to turn my hand at anything i got among bad companions took to drink had no luck with my claim took to the bush and in a word became what you would call over here a highway robber there were six of us and we had a wild free life of it sticking up a station from time to time or stopping the wagons on the road to the diggings black jack of ballarat was the name i went under and our party is still remembered in the colony as the ballarat gang “ one day a gold convoy came down from ballarat to melbourne and we lay in wait for it and attacked it there were six troopers and six of us so it was a close thing but we emptied four of their saddles at the first volley three of our boys were killed however before we got the swag i put my pistol to the head of the wagondriver who was this very man mccarthy i wish to the lord that i had shot him then but i spared him though i saw his wicked little eyes fixed on my face as though to remember every feature we got away with the gold became wealthy men and made our way over to england without being suspected there i parted from my old pals and determined to settle down to a quiet and respectable life i bought this estate which chanced to be in the market and i set myself to do a little good with my money to make up for the way in which i had earned it i married too and though my wife died young she left me my dear little alice even when she was just a baby her wee hand seemed to lead me down the right path as nothing else had ever done in a word i turned over a new leaf and did my best to make up for the past all was going well when mccarthy laid his grip upon me “ i had gone up to town about an investment and i met him in regent street with hardly a coat to his back or a boot to his foot “ ‘ here we are jack ’ says he touching me on the arm ‘ we ’ ll be as good as a family to you there ’ s two of us me and my son and you can have the keeping of us if you don ’ tit ’ s a fine lawabiding country is england and there ’ s always a policeman within hail ’ “ well down they came to the west country there was no shaking them off and there they have lived rent free on my best land ever since there was no rest for me no peace no forgetfulness turn where i would there was his cunning grinning face at my elbow it grew worse as alice grew up for he soon saw i was more afraid of her knowing my past than of the police whatever he wanted he must have and whatever it was i gave him without question land money houses until at last he asked a thing which i could not give he asked for alice “ his son you see had grown up and so had my girl and as i was known to be in weak health it seemed a fine stroke to him that his lad should step into the whole property but there i was firm i would not have his cursed stock mixed with mine not that i had any dislike to the lad but his blood was in him and that was enough i stood firm mccarthy threatened i braved him to do his worst we were to meet at the pool midway between our houses to talk it over “ when i went down there i found him talking with his son so i smoked a cigar and waited behind a tree until he should be alone but as i listened to his talk all that was black and bitter in me seemed to come uppermost he was urging his son to marry my daughter with as little regard for what she might think as if she were a slut from off the streets it drove me mad to think that i and all that i held most dear should be in the power of such a man as this could i not snap the bond i was already a dying and a desperate man though clear of mind and fairly strong of limb i knew that my own fate was sealed but my memory and my girl both could be saved if i could but silence that foul tongue i did it mr holmes i would do it again deeply as i have sinned i have led a life of martyrdom to atone for it but that my girl"
