   "“ i make nothing of it ” i answered frankly “ it is a most mysterious business ” “ as a rule ” said holmes “ the more bizarre a thing is the less mysterious it proves to be it is your commonplace featureless crimes which are really puzzling just as a commonplace face is the most difficult to identify but i must be prompt over this matter ” “ what are you going to do then ” i asked “ to smoke ” he answered “ it is quite a three pipe problem and i beg that you won ’ t speak to me for fifty minutes ” he curled himself up in his chair with his thin knees drawn up to his hawklike nose and there he sat with his eyes closed and his black clay pipe thrusting out like the bill of some strange bird i had come to the conclusion that he had dropped asleep and indeed was nodding myself when he suddenly sprang out of his chair with the gesture of a man who has made up his mind and put his pipe down upon the mantelpiece “ sarasate plays at the st james ’ s hall this afternoon ” he remarked “ what do you think watson could your patients spare you for a few hours ” “ i have nothing to do today my practice is never very absorbing ” “ then put on your hat and come i am going through the city first and we can have some lunch on the way i observe that there is a good deal of german music on the programme which is rather more to my taste than italian or french it is introspective and i want to introspect come along ” we travelled by the underground as far as aldersgate and a short walk took us to saxecoburg square the scene of the singular story which we had listened to in the morning it was a poky little shabbygenteel place where four lines of dingy twostoried brick houses looked out into a small railedin enclosure where a lawn of weedy grass and a few clumps of faded laurel bushes made a hard fight against a smokeladen and uncongenial atmosphere three gilt balls and a brown board with “ jabez wilson ” in white letters upon a corner house announced the place where our redheaded client carried on his business sherlock holmes stopped in front of it with his head on one side and looked it all over with his eyes shining brightly between puckered lids then he walked slowly up the street and then down again to the corner still looking keenly at the houses finally he returned to the pawnbroker ’ s and having thumped vigorously upon the pavement with his stick two or three times he went up to the door and knocked it was instantly opened by a brightlooking cleanshaven young fellow who asked him to step in “ thank you ” said holmes “ i only wished to ask you how you would go from here to the strand ” “ third right fourth left ” answered the assistant promptly closing the door “ smart fellow that ” observed holmes as we walked away “ he is in my judgment the fourth smartest man in london and for daring i am not sure that he has not a claim to be third i have known something of him before ” “ evidently ” said i “ mr wilson ’ s assistant counts for a good deal in this mystery of the redheaded league i am sure that you inquired your way merely in order that you might see him ” “ not him ” “ what then ” “ the knees of his trousers ” “ and what did you see ” “ what i expected to see ” “ why did you beat the pavement ” “ my dear doctor this is a time for observation not for talk we are spies in an enemy ’ s country we know something of saxecoburg square let us now explore the parts which lie behind it ” the road in which we found ourselves as we turned round the corner from the retired saxecoburg square presented as great a contrast to it as the front of a picture does to the back it was one of the main arteries which conveyed the traffic of the city to the north and west the roadway was blocked with the immense stream of commerce flowing in a double tide inward and outward while the footpaths were black with the hurrying swarm of pedestrians it was difficult to realise as we looked at the line of fine shops and stately business premises that they really abutted on the other side upon the faded and stagnant square which we had just quitted “ let me see ” said holmes standing at the corner and glancing along the line “ i should like just to remember the order of the houses here it is a hobby of mine to have an exact knowledge of london there is mortimer ’ s the tobacconist the little newspaper shop the coburg branch"

   "it read in this fashion “ the redheaded league is dissolved october 9 1890 ” sherlock holmes and i surveyed this curt announcement and the rueful face behind it until the comical side of the affair so completely overtopped every other consideration that we both burst out into a roar of laughter “ i can not see that there is anything very funny ” cried our client flushing up to the roots of his flaming head “ if you can do nothing better than laugh at me i can go elsewhere ” “ no no ” cried holmes shoving him back into the chair from which he had half risen “ i really wouldn ’ t miss your case for the world it is most refreshingly unusual but there is if you will excuse my saying so something just a little funny about it pray what steps did you take when you found the card upon the door ” “ i was staggered sir i did not know what to do then i called at the offices round but none of them seemed to know anything about it finally i went to the landlord who is an accountant living on the ground floor and i asked him if he could tell me what had become of the redheaded league he said that he had never heard of any such body then i asked him who mr duncan ross was he answered that the name was new to him “ ‘ well ’ said i ‘ the gentleman at no 4 ’ “ ‘ what the redheaded man ’ “ ‘ yes ’ “ ‘ oh ’ said he ‘ his name was william morris he was a solicitor and was using my room as a temporary convenience until his new premises were ready he moved out yesterday ’ “ ‘ where could i find him ’ “ ‘ oh at his new offices he did tell me the address yes 17 king edward street near st paul ’ s ’ “ i started off mr holmes but when i got to that address it was a manufactory of artificial kneecaps and no one in it had ever heard of either mr william morris or mr duncan ross ” “ and what did you do then ” asked holmes “ i went home to saxecoburg square and i took the advice of my assistant but he could not help me in any way he could only say that if i waited i should hear by post but that was not quite good enough mr holmes i did not wish to lose such a place without a struggle so as i had heard that you were good enough to give advice to poor folk who were in need of it i came right away to you ” “ and you did very wisely ” said holmes “ your case is an exceedingly remarkable one and i shall be happy to look into it from what you have told me i think that it is possible that graver issues hang from it than might at first sight appear ” “ grave enough ” said mr jabez wilson “ why i have lost four pound a week ” “ as far as you are personally concerned ” remarked holmes “ i do not see that you have any grievance against this extraordinary league on the contrary you are as i understand richer by some £ 30 to say nothing of the minute knowledge which you have gained on every subject which comes under the letter a you have lost nothing by them ” “ no sir but i want to find out about them and who they are and what their object was in playing this prankif it was a prankupon me it was a pretty expensive joke for them for it cost them two and thirty pounds ” “ we shall endeavour to clear up these points for you"

   "“ it appears that his arrest did not take place at once but after the return to hatherley farm on the inspector of constabulary informing him that he was a prisoner he remarked that he was not surprised to hear it and that it was no more than his deserts this observation of his had the natural effect of removing any traces of doubt which might have remained in the minds of the coroner ’ s jury ” “ it was a confession ” i ejaculated “ no for it was followed by a protestation of innocence ” “ coming on the top of such a damning series of events it was at least a most suspicious remark ” “ on the contrary ” said holmes “ it is the brightest rift which i can at present see in the clouds however innocent he might be he could not be such an absolute imbecile as not to see that the circumstances were very black against him had he appeared surprised at his own arrest or feigned indignation at it i should have looked upon it as highly suspicious because such surprise or anger would not be natural under the circumstances and yet might appear to be the best policy to a scheming man his frank acceptance of the situation marks him as either an innocent man or else as a man of considerable selfrestraint and firmness as to his remark about his deserts it was also not unnatural if you consider that he stood beside the dead body of his father and that there is no doubt that he had that very day so far forgotten his filial duty as to bandy words with him and even according to the little girl whose evidence is so important to raise his hand as if to strike him the selfreproach and contrition which are displayed in his remark appear to me to be the signs of a healthy mind rather than of a guilty one ” i shook my head “ many men have been hanged on far slighter evidence ” i remarked “ so they have and many men have been wrongfully hanged ” “ what is the young man ’ s own account of the matter ” “ it is i am afraid not very encouraging to his supporters though there are one or two points in it which are suggestive you will find it here and may read it for yourself ” he picked out from his bundle a copy of the local herefordshire paper and having turned down the sheet he pointed out the paragraph in which the unfortunate young man had given his own statement of what had occurred i settled myself down in the corner of the carriage and read it very carefully it ran in this way “ mr james mccarthy the only son of the deceased was then called and gave evidence as follows ‘ i had been away from home for three days at bristol and had only just returned upon the morning of last monday the 3rd my father was absent from home at the time of my arrival and i was informed by the maid that he had driven over to ross with john cobb the groom shortly after my return i heard the wheels of his trap in the yard and looking out of my window i saw him get out and walk rapidly out of the yard though i was not aware in which direction he was going i then took my gun and strolled out in the direction of the boscombe pool with the intention of visiting the rabbit warren which is upon the other side on my way i saw william crowder the gamekeeper as he had stated in his evidence but he is mistaken in thinking that i was following my father i had no idea that he was in front of me when about a hundred yards from the pool"

   "at our very window a long drawn catlike whine which told us that the cheetah was indeed at liberty far away we could hear the deep tones of the parish clock which boomed out every quarter of an hour how long they seemed those quarters twelve struck and one and two and three and still we sat waiting silently for whatever might befall suddenly there was the momentary gleam of a light up in the direction of the ventilator which vanished immediately but was succeeded by a strong smell of burning oil and heated metal someone in the next room had lit a darklantern i heard a gentle sound of movement and then all was silent once more though the smell grew stronger for half an hour i sat with straining ears then suddenly another sound became audiblea very gentle soothing sound like that of a small jet of steam escaping continually from a kettle the instant that we heard it holmes sprang from the bed struck a match and lashed furiously with his cane at the bellpull “ you see it watson ” he yelled “ you see it ” but i saw nothing at the moment when holmes struck the light i heard a low clear whistle but the sudden glare flashing into my weary eyes made it impossible for me to tell what it was at which my friend lashed so savagely i could however see that his face was deadly pale and filled with horror and loathing he had ceased to strike and was gazing up at the ventilator when suddenly there broke from the silence of the night the most horrible cry to which i have ever listened it swelled up louder and louder a hoarse yell of pain and fear and anger all mingled in the one dreadful shriek they say that away down in the village and even in the distant parsonage that cry raised the sleepers from their beds it struck cold to our hearts and i stood gazing at holmes and he at me until the last echoes of it had died away into the silence from which it rose “ what can it mean ” i gasped “ it means that it is all over ” holmes answered “ and perhaps after all it is for the best take your pistol and we will enter dr roylott ’ s room ” with a grave face he lit the lamp and led the way down the corridor twice he struck at the chamber door without any reply from within then he turned the handle and entered i at his heels with the cocked pistol in my hand it was a singular sight which met our eyes on the table stood a darklantern with the shutter half open throwing a brilliant beam of light upon the iron safe the door of which was ajar beside this table on the wooden chair sat dr grimesby roylott clad in a long grey dressinggown his bare ankles protruding beneath and his feet thrust into red heelless turkish slippers across his lap lay the short stock with the long lash which we had noticed during the day his chin was cocked upward and his eyes were fixed in a dreadful rigid stare at the corner of the ceiling round his brow he had a peculiar yellow band with brownish speckles which seemed to be bound tightly round his head as we entered he made neither sound nor motion “ the band the speckled band ” whispered holmes i took a step forward in an instant his strange headgear began to move and there reared itself from among his hair the squat diamondshaped head and puffed neck of a loathsome serpent “ it is a swamp adder ” cried holmes “ the deadliest snake in india he"
