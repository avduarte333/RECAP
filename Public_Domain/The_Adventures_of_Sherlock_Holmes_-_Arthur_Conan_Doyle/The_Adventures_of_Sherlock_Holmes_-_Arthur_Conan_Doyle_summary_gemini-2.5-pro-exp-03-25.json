It was not that he felt any emotion akin to love for Irene Adler. All emotions, and that one particularly, were abhorrent to his cold, precise but admirably balanced mind. He was, I take it, the most perfect reasoning and observing machine that the world has seen, but as a lover he would have placed himself in a false position. He never spoke of the softer passions, save with a gibe and a sneer. They were admirable things for the observer—excellent for drawing the veil from men’s motives and actions. But for the trained reasoner to admit such intrusions into his own delicate and finely adjusted temperament was to introduce a distracting factor which might throw a doubt upon all his mental results. Grit in a sensitive instrument, or a crack in one of his own high-power lenses, would not be more disturbing than a strong emotion in a nature such as his. And yet there was but one woman to him, and that woman was the late Irene Adler, of dubious and questionable memory.",

In his view, she outshone and dominated all others of her sex. His feelings for her were not romantic; love and all emotions were repellent to his cold, precise, yet brilliantly balanced intellect. I believe he was the most perfect machine for reasoning and observation the world has ever seen, and being a lover would have put him in an unnatural state. He only spoke of emotional matters with mockery and disdain, seeing them as useful for observing others' motivations but detrimental for a trained reasoner's own delicate disposition. Allowing such feelings to intrude would introduce a distraction that could compromise his mental calculations, much like grit in a sensitive instrument or a flaw in a high-power lens. Yet, there was only one woman who held significance for him, and that was the late Irene Adler, remembered for her questionable past.",

In his estimation, she outshone and dominated all other women. It's not that he felt any love for Irene Adler; in fact, all emotions—especially love—were detestable to his cold, exact, but exquisitely balanced mind. Holmes was, as I see it, the finest reasoning and observing machine the world had ever known, but as a romantic he would have been out of place. He only ever mentioned matters of the heart with sarcasm and derision. Such feelings, he believed, were valuable for understanding people's motives and actions, but for someone so devoted to rational thinking, allowing emotions into his finely tuned mindset would risk undermining his mental clarity. The presence of emotion in his mind would be as troubling as grit in a precise instrument, or a crack in one of his powerful lenses. Nevertheless, there was only ever one woman in his eyes, and that was the now-deceased Irene Adler, whose reputation was somewhat questionable."

He was still, as ever, deeply attracted by the study of crime, and occupied his immense faculties and extraordinary powers of observation in following out those clues, and clearing up those mysteries which had been abandoned as hopeless by the official police. From time to time I heard some vague account of his doings: of his summons to Odessa in the case of the Trepoff murder, of his clearing up of the singular tragedy of the Atkinson brothers at Trincomalee, and finally of the mission which he had accomplished so delicately and successfully for the reigning family of Holland.

Holmes was still passionately interested in the study of crime, dedicating his remarkable talents and sharp observational skills to pursuing clues and solving mysteries that the official police had given up as unsolvable.

Just a trifle more, I fancy, Watson. And in practice again, I observe. You did not tell me that you intended to go into harness.”\n“Then, how do you know?”\n“I see it, I deduce it.

It is peculiarly strong and stiff.”\n“Peculiar—that is the very word,” said Holmes. “It is not an English paper at all. Hold it up to the light.”\nI did so, and saw a large “E” with a small “g,” a “P,” and a large “G” with a small “t” woven into the texture of the paper.\n“What do you make of that?” asked Holmes.\n“The name of the maker, no doubt; or his monogram, rather.”\n“Not at all. The ‘G’ with the small ‘t’ stands for ‘Gesellschaft,’ which is the German for ‘Company.’ It is a customary contraction like our ‘Co.’ ‘P,’ of course, stands for ‘Papier.’ Now for the ‘Eg.’ Let us glance at our Continental Gazetteer.” He took down a heavy brown volume from his shelves. “Eglow, Eglonitz—here we are, Egria. It is in a German-speaking country—in Bohemia, not far from Carlsbad. ‘Remarkable as being the scene of the death of Wallenstein, and for its numerous glass-factories and paper-mills.’ Ha, ha, my boy, what do you make of that?” His eyes sparkled, and he sent up a great blue triumphant cloud from his cigarette.\n“The paper was made in Bohemia,” I said.\n“Precisely. And the man who wrote the note is a German. Do you note the peculiar construction of the sentence—‘This account of you we have from all quarters received.’ A Frenchman or Russian could not have written that. It is the German who is so uncourteous to his verbs. It only remains, therefore, to discover what is wanted by this German who writes upon Bohemian paper and prefers wearing a mask to showing his face. And here he comes, if I am not mistaken, to resolve all our doubts.”",
          "paraphrase_gemini-2.5-flash-preview-04-17": "I studied the writing and the paper it was on very carefully.\n“The man who wrote this is probably well-off,” I commented, trying to emulate my companion's approach. “This kind of paper would cost at least half a crown per pack. It's unusually strong and thick.”\n“Unusual—that's exactly right,” Holmes said. “It's not English paper at all. Hold it up to the light.”\nI did as he asked, and I saw a large ‘E’ next to a small ‘g,’ a ‘P,’ and a large ‘G’ next to a small ‘t’ woven into the paper's texture.\n“What do you make of those marks?” Holmes inquired.\n“The manufacturer's name, I assume; or perhaps their logo.”\n“Not quite. The ‘G’ followed by the small ‘t’ stands for ‘Gesellschaft,’ which means ‘Company’ in German. It's a common abbreviation, like our ‘Co.’ The ‘P,’ naturally, means ‘Papier.’ Now, about the ‘Eg.’ Let's check our Continental Gazetteer.” He pulled a heavy brown book down from his shelf. “Eglow, Eglonitz—ah, here we are, Egria. It’s located in a German-speaking territory—in Bohemia, not far from Carlsbad. ‘Notable as the site of Wallenstein’s death, and for its numerous glass and paper factories.’ Ha, ha, my dear fellow, what do you make of that?” His eyes shone with excitement, and he exhaled a large, triumphant cloud of blue smoke from his cigarette.\n“The paper was produced in Bohemia,” I concluded.\n“Exactly. And the individual who wrote the message is German. Did you notice the peculiar phrasing of the sentence—‘This account of you we have from all quarters received.’ A Frenchman or a Russian would not structure a sentence like that. It's the German who tends to be so impolite to his verbs. Therefore, the only remaining task is to discover what this German, who writes on Bohemian paper and prefers concealing his face behind a mask, wants. And here he comes, unless I'm mistaken, to clear up all our uncertainties.”",

It’s unusually firm and resilient.\" \n\"Exactly—unusual is the key word,\" replied Holmes. \"This isn’t British paper. Try holding it up to the light.\" \nI did as he asked and noticed the letters: a big 'E' paired with a small 'g,' a 'P,' and a big 'G' alongside a small 't,' all woven into the paper itself.\n\"What does that suggest to you?\" Holmes questioned.\n\"Probably the manufacturer’s name, or perhaps initials,\" I suggested.\n\"Not at all. The 'G' with 't' stands for 'Gesellschaft,' the German word for 'Company.' It’s abbreviated much like we use 'Co.'—and 'P' is for 'Papier,' or 'paper.' Now let’s figure out the 'Eg.' Together.\" Holmes pulled a heavy brown book from the shelf. \"Eglow, Eglonitz—here, Egria. It’s a region where German is spoken, in Bohemia near Carlsbad. It’s famous because Wallenstein died there and for its many glassworks and paper manufacturers. So, what do you think?\" Holmes looked excited, blowing out a triumphant puff of cigarette smoke.\n\"The paper was produced in Bohemia,\" I responded.\n\"Exactly. And the author of the note is German. Notice the unusual sentence order: ‘This account of you we have from all quarters received.’ No Frenchman or Russian would write that way; Germans are renowned for this awkward verb placement. That means we only need to find out what this German—who pens his notes on Bohemian paper and hides his features—wants. And if I’m correct, he’s arriving now to clear up our uncertainties.\""

Heavy bands of astrakhan were slashed across the sleeves and fronts of his double-breasted coat, while the deep blue cloak which was thrown over his shoulders was lined with flame-coloured silk and secured at the neck with a brooch which consisted of a single flaming beryl. Boots which extended halfway up his calves, and which were trimmed at the tops with rich brown fur, completed the impression of barbaric opulence which was suggested by his whole appearance.

At present it is not too much to say that it is of such weight it may have an influence upon European history.”\n“I promise,” said Holmes.\n“And I.”\n“You will excuse this mask,” continued our strange visitor. “The august person who employs me wishes his agent to be unknown to you, and I may confess at once that the title by which I have just called myself is not exactly my own.”\n“I was aware of it,” said Holmes dryly.\n“The circumstances are of great delicacy, and every precaution has to be taken to quench what might grow to be an immense scandal and seriously compromise one of the reigning families of Europe. To speak plainly, the matter implicates the great House of Ormstein, hereditary kings of Bohemia.”\n“I was also aware of that,” murmured Holmes, settling himself down in his armchair and closing his eyes.",

Thick strips of astrakhan fur adorned the sleeves and front of his double-breasted coat, while his deep blue cloak, draped over his shoulders, was lined with vibrant flame-coloured silk and fastened at the neck with a brooch featuring a single brilliant beryl. Boots reaching mid-calf, trimmed with rich brown fur at the top, completed the impression of uncivilized grandeur conveyed by his entire appearance. He held a wide-brimmed hat and wore a black mask, or vizard, covering the upper half of his face, extending down past his cheekbones.

The name is no doubt familiar to you.”\n“Kindly look her up in my index, Doctor,” murmured Holmes without opening his eyes. For many years he had adopted a system of docketing all paragraphs concerning men and things, so that it was difficult to name a subject or a person on which he could not at once furnish information. In this case I found her biography sandwiched in between that of a Hebrew rabbi and that of a staff-commander who had written a monograph upon the deep-sea fishes.\n“Let me see!” said Holmes. “Hum! Born in New Jersey in the year 1858. Contralto—hum! La Scala, hum! Prima donna Imperial Opera of Warsaw—yes! Retired from operatic stage—ha! Living in London—quite so! Your Majesty, as I understand, became entangled with this young person, wrote her some compromising letters, and is now desirous of getting those letters back.”\n“Precisely so. But how—”\n“Was there a secret marriage?”\n“None.”\n“No legal papers or certificates?”\n“None.”\n“Then I fail to follow your Majesty.

Her name is likely familiar to you.”\n“Kindly locate her details in my records, Doctor,” Holmes murmured, his eyes remaining shut. For many years, he had maintained a method of filing every piece of information regarding people and events, making it difficult to name a topic or individual about whom he couldn't instantly provide information. In this instance, I found her biographical entry placed between that of a Hebrew rabbi and that of a staff-commander who had authored a scholarly paper on deep-sea fish.\n“Let’s see!” Holmes remarked. “Hmm!

As I understand, Your Majesty became romantically involved with this young woman, wrote her compromising letters, and now wishes to retrieve those letters.”\n“Precisely. But how did you know—”\n“Was there a clandestine marriage?”\n“None.”\n“No official papers or certificates?”\n“None.”\n“Then I am unable to understand, Your Majesty.

For years, Holmes had kept detailed records about people and topics, so he could easily access information on most subjects. I found Adler's biography filed between a Hebrew rabbi and a naval officer known for his work on deep-sea fish. Holmes reviewed the details: \"Born in New Jersey in 1858, a contralto, performed at La Scala, leading soprano at the Imperial Opera in Warsaw, since retired from the stage, currently living in London. I believe, Your Majesty, you became involved with this woman, sent her some indiscreet letters, and now wish to retrieve them.\" \"Exactly, but how—\" asked the King. Holmes continued his questions: \"Was there a secret marriage? No. Any documentation? No. Then I don’t see the issue, Your Majesty. If she threatens exposure, how can she prove the letters are genuine?\" \"There’s the handwriting,\" said the King. \"Easily forged,\" replied Holmes. \"The private stationery?\" \"Could be stolen.\" \"My seal?\" \"It can be copied.\" \"My photo?\" \"She could buy one.\" \"We are both in the photo,\" the King revealed. \"That complicates matters!\" Holmes exclaimed. \"You have certainly gotten yourself into a predicament, Your Majesty.\""

Chubb lock to the door. Large sitting-room on the right side, well furnished, with long windows almost to the floor, and those preposterous English window fasteners which a child could open. Behind there was nothing remarkable, save that the passage window could be reached from the top of the coach-house. I walked round it and examined it closely from every point of view, but without noting anything else of interest.\n“I then lounged down the street and found, as I expected, that there was a mews in a lane which runs down by one wall of the garden. I lent the ostlers a hand in rubbing down their horses, and received in exchange twopence, a glass of half-and-half, two fills of shag tobacco, and as much information as I could desire about Miss Adler, to say nothing of half a dozen other people in the neighbourhood in whom I was not in the least interested, but whose biographies I was compelled to listen to.”",
          "paraphrase_gemini-2.5-flash-preview-04-17": "“This is truly amusing,” Holmes remarked. “You could never guess how I spent my morning or what the final outcome was.” “I can’t imagine,” Watson replied. “I presume you were observing the routine and perhaps the residence of Miss Irene Adler.” “Precisely,” Holmes confirmed, “but the subsequent events were rather out of the ordinary. Let me explain. I left home a little after eight this morning, disguised as an unemployed groom. There’s a remarkable bond and shared understanding among horsemen; become one of them, and you learn everything worth knowing. I quickly found Briony Lodge. It’s a charming, small house with a garden behind it, but the front is built right up to the road. It has two levels, a Chubb lock on the door, and a spacious, well-appointed sitting-room on the right with long windows that nearly reach the floor, fitted with those absurdly simple English window catches that are easy for a child to open. The back held nothing unusual, apart from a passage window accessible from the roof of the coach-house. I circled the property, examining it thoroughly from every perspective, but didn’t notice anything else noteworthy.” “I then casually walked down the street and found, just as I expected, that there were stables located in a lane running alongside one of the garden walls. I helped the stablehands rub down their horses. In exchange, I received two pence, a glass of mixed ale and stout, two pipefuls of shag tobacco, and all the information I desired about Miss Adler. This was not to mention details about half a dozen other neighbours I wasn’t at all interested in, but whose life stories I was compelled to hear.”",
          "paraphrase_gpt-4.1-2025-04-14": "\"This really is quite amusing. I bet you’d never figure out how I spent my morning, or what I eventually ended up doing.\" \n\"I have no idea. I’m guessing you were studying Miss Irene Adler’s habits, and maybe also keeping an eye on her house?\"\n\"Exactly; though what happened next was rather out of the ordinary. Anyway, let me explain. I left home a little after eight today, disguised as an unemployed stable worker. There’s this remarkable camaraderie among people who work with horses — once you pretend to be one of them, you learn everything there is to know. I quickly located Briony Lodge. It’s a charming little house with a backyard garden, but the front is built right up against the street, two stories high. The front door has a Chubb lock. The main sitting room is to the right, well-appointed, with tall windows reaching nearly to the floor, and those absurd English window latches that even a child could open. There wasn’t much of interest at the back, except that you could access the passage window from the roof of the coach-house. I circled the place, inspecting closely from all sides, but didn’t spot anything else noteworthy.\n\nAfterwards, I strolled down the street and, as I suspected, found some stables in a lane along the garden wall. I lent a hand to the stable hands as they groomed their horses, and in return I got twopence, a glass of half-and-half, a couple pipefuls of shag tobacco, and as much gossip about Miss Adler as I wanted — plus the life stories of half a dozen neighbors I didn’t care about, but had to hear anyway.\""

          "text_segment": "“And what of Irene Adler?” I asked.\n“Oh, she has turned all the men’s heads down in that part. She is the daintiest thing under a bonnet on this planet. So say the Serpentine-mews, to a man. She lives quietly, sings at concerts, drives out at five every day, and returns at seven sharp for dinner. Seldom goes out at other times, except when she sings. Has only one male visitor, but a good deal of him. He is dark, handsome, and dashing, never calls less than once a day, and often twice. He is a Mr. Godfrey Norton, of the Inner Temple. See the advantages of a cabman as a confidant. They had driven him home a dozen times from Serpentine-mews, and knew all about him. When I had listened to all they had to tell, I began to walk up and down near Briony Lodge once more, and to think over my plan of campaign.\n“This Godfrey Norton was evidently an important factor in the matter. He was a lawyer. That sounded ominous. What was the relation between them, and what the object of his repeated visits? Was she his client, his friend, or his mistress? If the former, she had probably transferred the photograph to his keeping. If the latter, it was less likely. On the issue of this question depended whether I should continue my work at Briony Lodge, or turn my attention to the gentleman’s chambers in the Temple. It was a delicate point, and it widened the field of my inquiry. I fear that I bore you with these details, but I have to let you see my little difficulties, if you are to understand the situation.”",
          "paraphrase_gemini-2.5-flash-preview-04-17": "I inquired, \"And what about Irene Adler?\" Holmes replied that in that part of town, she had utterly captivated all the men. He quoted the Serpentine-mews cabmen, who unanimously described her as the most exquisite woman imaginable. He reported that she leads a quiet life, performs at concerts, goes for a carriage ride daily from five until seven, returning punctually for dinner. She seldom leaves her home at other times, except for her singing engagements. She has only one male visitor, but sees a great deal of him. This man is dark, handsome, and charismatic, and he visits at least once, often twice, every day. He is Mr. Godfrey Norton, a lawyer from the Inner Temple. Holmes highlighted the usefulness of cabmen as informants; having driven Norton from the mews many times, they were well-acquainted with him. After hearing all this information, Holmes resumed his pacing near Briony Lodge, contemplating his strategy. It was clear that Godfrey Norton played a crucial role in the affair. The fact that he was a lawyer struck Holmes as potentially problematic. Holmes pondered their relationship and the reason for his frequent calls. Were they client and lawyer, friends, or lovers? If she was his client, she might well have given him the photograph for safekeeping. If they were romantically involved, this seemed less likely. The answer to this question was critical, as it would determine whether he should continue focusing on Briony Lodge or shift his investigation to the gentleman's chambers in the Temple. This presented a complex issue and expanded the scope of his inquiry. Holmes added that he hoped these details weren't tiresome but were necessary for Watson to fully understand the challenges he faced in the situation.",
          "paraphrase_gpt-4.1-2025-04-14": "\"What about Irene Adler?\" I inquired. \"Oh, she's charmed every man around here. Everyone in Serpentine-mews agrees she’s the most charming woman around. She lives a quiet life, sings at concerts, goes out in her carriage every day at five, and returns home promptly at seven for dinner. She rarely goes out at other times, except for her singing engagements. She receives visits from only one man, but he visits her often. He’s a strikingly handsome and lively man named Mr. Godfrey Norton, of the Inner Temple, and he visits her at least once a day, sometimes twice. One advantage of talking to cab drivers is that they often know a lot; they had given Mr. Norton rides from Serpentine-mews multiple times and knew much about him. After hearing all this, I walked up and down near Briony Lodge again, considering my next move. It was clear that Godfrey Norton was a significant figure. Since he was a lawyer, this could be concerning. I pondered what their relationship might be and the reason for his frequent visits. Was she his client, a friend, or possibly his mistress? If she was his client, she might have entrusted him with the photograph. If not, that seemed less likely. Deciding this would determine if I should keep watching Briony Lodge or start investigating the lawyer’s place at the Temple. It was a subtle issue and complicated my investigation. I hope these details don’t bore you, but I need to share my thought process so you can understand the situation.\""

          "text_segment": "“I am following you closely,” I answered.\n“I was still balancing the matter in my mind when a hansom cab drove up to Briony Lodge, and a gentleman sprang out. He was a remarkably handsome man, dark, aquiline, and moustached—evidently the man of whom I had heard. He appeared to be in a great hurry, shouted to the cabman to wait, and brushed past the maid who opened the door with the air of a man who was thoroughly at home.\n“He was in the house about half an hour, and I could catch glimpses of him in the windows of the sitting-room, pacing up and down, talking excitedly, and waving his arms. Of her I could see nothing. Presently he emerged, looking even more flurried than before. As he stepped up to the cab, he pulled a gold watch from his pocket and looked at it earnestly, ‘Drive like the devil,’ he shouted, ‘first to Gross & Hankey’s in Regent Street, and then to the Church of St. Monica in the Edgeware Road. Half a guinea if you do it in twenty minutes!’\n“Away they went, and I was just wondering whether I should not do well to follow them when up the lane came a neat little landau, the coachman with his coat only half-buttoned, and his tie under his ear, while all the tags of his harness were sticking out of the buckles. It hadn’t pulled up before she shot out of the hall door and into it. I only caught a glimpse of her at the moment, but she was a lovely woman, with a face that a man might die for.\n“‘The Church of St. Monica, John,’ she cried, ‘and half a sovereign if you reach it in twenty minutes.’\n“This was quite too good to lose, Watson. I was just balancing whether I should run for it, or whether I should perch behind her landau when a cab came through the street. The driver looked twice at such a shabby fare, but I jumped in before he could object. ‘The Church of St. Monica,’ said I, ‘and half a sovereign if you reach it in twenty minutes.’ It was twenty-five minutes to twelve, and of course it was clear enough what was in the wind.\n“My cabby drove fast. I don’t think I ever drove faster, but the others were there before us. The cab and the landau with their steaming horses were in front of the door when I arrived. I paid the man and hurried into the church. There was not a soul there save the two whom I had followed and a surpliced clergyman, who seemed to be expostulating with them. They were all three standing in a knot in front of the altar. I lounged up the side aisle like any other idler who has dropped into a church. Suddenly, to my surprise, the three at the altar faced round to me, and Godfrey Norton came running as hard as he could towards me.\n“‘Thank God,’ he cried. ‘You’ll do. Come! Come!’\n“‘What then?’ I asked.\n“‘Come, man, come, only three minutes, or it won’t be legal.’\n“I was half-dragged up to the altar, and before I knew where I was I found myself mumbling responses which were whispered in my ear, and vouching for things of which I knew nothing, and generally assisting in the secure tying up of Irene Adler, spinster, to Godfrey Norton, bachelor. It was all done in an instant, and there was the gentleman thanking me on the one side and the lady on the other, while the clergyman beamed on me in front. It was the most preposterous position in which I ever found myself in my life, and it was the thought of it that started me laughing just now. It seems that there had been some informality about their license, that the clergyman absolutely refused to marry them without a witness of some sort, and that my lucky appearance saved the bridegroom from having to sally out into the streets in search of a best man. The bride gave me a sovereign, and I mean to wear it on my watch chain in memory of the occasion.”",
          "paraphrase_gemini-2.5-flash-preview-04-17": "I confirmed I was following you closely. While I was still contemplating the situation, a hansom cab pulled up at Briony Lodge, and a gentleman alighted. He was notably attractive, with dark hair, an aquiline nose, and a moustache—clearly the individual I had been told about. He seemed very rushed, told the cab driver to wait, and hurried past the maid who opened the door as if he were quite at home there. He remained inside for around thirty minutes. I could occasionally see him through the sitting-room windows, pacing back and forth, speaking animatedly, and gesturing widely. I couldn't see her at all. He eventually came out, looking even more agitated than before. As he approached the cab, he took a gold watch from his pocket and examined it intently. \"Drive like lightning!\" he yelled. \"First to Gross & Hankey's on Regent Street, then to St. Monica's Church on Edgeware Road. Half a guinea if you make it in twenty minutes!\" They sped off. I was just considering if I should follow them when a tidy little landau appeared down the lane. The coachman's coat was only partially buttoned, his tie was crooked, and his harness straps were sticking out of the buckles, indicating haste. Before it had even stopped, she dashed out of the main door and into it. I only saw her briefly then, but she was a stunning woman with a face captivating enough to inspire devotion unto death. \"'St. Monica's Church, John,' she called out, 'and half a sovereign if we get there in twenty minutes.'\" This opportunity was too valuable to miss, Watson. I was debating whether to run there myself or hop onto the back of her landau when a cab came down the street. The driver hesitated, noticing my shabby appearance, but I quickly got in before he could refuse. \"'St. Monica's Church,' I told him, 'and half a sovereign if you reach it in twenty minutes.'\" It was twenty-five minutes before noon, and it was perfectly clear what was happening. My cab driver went fast. I don't think I've ever travelled faster, but the others had arrived before us. Both the cab and the landau, with their horses steaming, were outside the door when I got there. I paid the driver and hurried into the church. There was no one inside except the two people I had followed and a clergyman wearing a surplice, who seemed to be arguing with them. All three were gathered near the altar. I walked slowly up the side aisle, pretending to be a casual visitor looking around a church. Suddenly, to my astonishment, the three people at the altar turned and looked at me, and Godfrey Norton came rushing towards me as fast as he could. \"'Thank heavens!' he exclaimed. 'You'll do. Come! Come!'\" \"'What's going on?' I inquired.\" \"'Come on, man, come, only three minutes left, or it won't be valid!'\" I was practically dragged towards the altar, and before I fully understood what was happening, I found myself softly repeating responses whispered to me, confirming things I knew nothing about, and essentially helping to officially tie the knot between Irene Adler, single woman, and Godfrey Norton, single man. It all happened in an instant. Afterwards, the gentleman was thanking me on one side, and the lady on the other, while the clergyman smiled kindly at me from the front. It was the most ridiculous situation I have ever experienced in my life, and recalling it is what made me start laughing just now. Apparently, there had been an issue with their marriage license, and the clergyman absolutely refused to perform the ceremony without some kind of witness. My opportune appearance saved the groom from having to go out into the street to find a best man. The bride gave me a sovereign, which I intend to wear on my watch chain as a souvenir of that event.",
          "paraphrase_gpt-4.1-2025-04-14": "\"I'm right behind you,\" I replied.\n\n\"While I was still thinking things over, a hansom cab arrived at Briony Lodge, and a dashing, dark-haired man with an aquiline nose and a mustache jumped out. He was clearly the person I'd heard about. He looked like he was in quite a rush, told the cab driver to wait, and strode past the maid who opened the door with the confidence of someone who belonged there.\n\nHe stayed inside the house for about thirty minutes. Through the sitting-room windows, I caught occasional glimpses of him as he paced back and forth, gesturing energetically and speaking with passion. I couldn't see her at all. Soon, he came out, looking even more agitated. As he approached the cab, he took a gold watch from his pocket, checked it intently, and shouted, 'Drive like mad, first to Gross & Hankey’s on Regent Street, then to St. Monica’s Church on Edgeware Road. Half a guinea if you do it in twenty minutes!'\n\nOff they sped. I was just debating whether I should follow when a tidy little landau carriage came up the lane, the coachman looking a bit disheveled, with his coat partly done up and his tie askew, his harness oddly unfastened. The carriage had barely stopped when she darted out of the house and into it. I only caught a swift look at her, but she was stunningly beautiful.\n\n'To St. Monica’s Church, John,' she called, 'and half a sovereign if you make it in twenty minutes.'\n\nWatson, this was simply too important to miss. I was torn between running after them or jumping on the back of her carriage, when suddenly another cab came by. Despite my somewhat rough appearance, I hopped in before the driver could object. 'St. Monica’s Church,' I told him, 'and half a sovereign if you get there in twenty minutes.' It was twenty-five minutes to noon, and it was obvious what was happening.\n\nMy driver raced along at breakneck speed. I don’t think I’ve ever traveled faster, but even so, the cab and the landau were already outside the church when I arrived. I paid my fare and hurried inside. There was no one there but the couple I’d been following and a clergyman in robes, who seemed to be protesting about something. The three of them were huddled together at the altar's front. I casually walked up the side aisle, as if I was just wandering in.\n\nSuddenly, to my surprise, the trio at the altar turned to face me, and Godfrey Norton ran up to me at full speed.\n\n'Thank heavens,' he exclaimed. 'You'll do. Come with us! Quickly!'\n\n'Why?' I asked.\n\n'Just come! Only three minutes left, or it won’t be legal.'\n\nI was half-pulled to the altar, and before I knew what was happening, I was repeating whispered responses, affirming things I knew nothing about, and generally helping to marry Irene Adler, a single woman, to Godfrey Norton, a bachelor. It all happened so quickly. Afterwards, both of them thanked me warmly while the clergyman smiled. It was the most ridiculous situation I've ever found myself in, and thinking about it just made me laugh. Apparently, there had been a problem with their marriage license, and the priest refused to perform the ceremony without a witness. My fortunate appearance spared the groom from having to find a best man out on the street. The bride handed me a gold sovereign, and I intend to keep it on my watch-chain as a memento of the event.\""

By the way, Doctor, I'll require your assistance.\"\n\"I'd be happy to help.\"\n\"Do you mind bending the law?\"\n\"Not at all.\"\n\"Or risking arrest?\"\n\"If it's for a good cause, certainly not.\"\n\"Oh, the cause is most worthy!\"\n\"Then count me in.\"\n\"I knew I could depend on you,\" he said."

In two hours we must be on the scene of action. Miss Irene, or Madame, rather, returns from her drive at seven. We must be at Briony Lodge to meet her.”\n“And what then?”\n“You must leave that to me. I have already arranged what is to occur. There is only one point on which I must insist. You must not interfere, come what may. You understand?”\n“I am to be neutral?”\n“To do nothing whatever. There will probably be some small unpleasantness. Do not join in it. It will end in my being conveyed into the house. Four or five minutes afterwards the sitting-room window will open. You are to station yourself close to that open window.”\n“Yes.”\n“You are to watch me, for I will be visible to you.”\n“Yes.”\n“And when I raise my hand—so—you will throw into the room what I give you to throw, and will, at the same time, raise the cry of fire. You quite follow me?”\n“Entirely.”\n“It is nothing very formidable,” he said, taking a long cigar-shaped roll from his pocket. “It is an ordinary plumber’s smoke-rocket, fitted with a cap at either end to make it self-lighting. Your task is confined to that. When you raise your cry of fire, it will be taken up by quite a number of people. You may then walk to the end of the street, and I will rejoin you in ten minutes. I hope that I have made myself clear?”\n“I am to remain neutral, to get near the window, to watch you, and at the signal to throw in this object, then to raise the cry of fire, and to wait you at the corner of the street.”\n“Precisely.”\n“Then you may entirely rely on me.”",

We need to be at the location within two hours. Miss Irene, or rather, Madame, is due back from her outing at seven. We must be at Briony Lodge to intercept her.\" \"And after that?\" I asked. \"Leave the details to me,\" he stated. \"I've already planned everything out. There is just one crucial point I must emphasize: whatever happens, you must not intervene. Do you understand?\" \"So, I'm not to take sides?\" \"Exactly. You are to do absolutely nothing active. Things might get a little unpleasant, but do not get involved. The goal is for me to be admitted into the house. Approximately four or five minutes later, the window of the sitting-room will open. You are to position yourself right next to that open window.\" \"Understood.\" \"Keep your eyes on me, as I'll be visible from there.\" \"Yes.\" \"And when I raise my hand like this\"—he demonstrated the gesture—\"you will throw the object I give you into the room, and simultaneously, shout 'fire'. Are you following me completely?\" \"Completely.\" \"It's nothing dangerous,\" he said, pulling a long, cylindrical item from his pocket. \"It's just a standard plumber's smoke-rocket, equipped with caps on both ends for automatic ignition. Your only job is that. When you raise the alarm of 'fire', it will be echoed by several people. You can then walk to the end of the street, and I will meet you there in ten minutes. Have I made my instructions clear?\" \"So, I am to remain uninvolved, station myself by the window, watch you, and at your signal, throw this item inside, then shout 'fire', and finally wait for you at the street corner.\" \"Precisely.\" \"In that case, you can count on me entirely.\"",

It's almost five o'clock, and in two hours we need to be there. Miss Irene—actually, Madame—will be back from her drive at seven, and we must be at Briony Lodge to meet her.\"\n\"And after that?\" I prompted.\n\"Leave everything else to me. I've already planned out what will happen. There's just one thing you must follow: you cannot interfere, no matter what. Do you understand?\"\n\"So I am to stay out of it—be neutral?\"\n\"Exactly. Just do nothing. There will likely be a bit of unpleasantness, but don't get involved. I'll be taken into the house, and four or five minutes later, the sitting-room window will open. Make sure you're standing close by.\"\n\"Alright.\"\n\"Watch for me—I'll be visible to you.\"\n\"Understood.\"\n\"When I raise my hand like this,\" he demonstrated, \"you'll throw this object into the room,\" handing me a cigar-shaped device, \"and at the same moment, shout 'Fire!'. Are you clear on that?\"\n\"Completely.\"\n\"There's nothing dangerous about it,\" he added, showing me what looked like an ordinary plumber's smoke-rocket. \"It's simple and self-lighting. That's your only task. When you shout 'fire', others will echo the alarm. After that, you may walk to the end of the street, and within ten minutes, I will join you there. Is everything clear?\"\n\"To recap: I remain neutral, get close to the window, watch you, and, on your signal, throw this object into the room, shout 'fire!', and then wait for you at the corner.\"\n\"Exactly.\"\n\"You can count on me,\" I assured him."

          "text_segment": "“That is excellent. I think, perhaps, it is almost time that I prepare for the new role I have to play.”\nHe disappeared into his bedroom and returned in a few minutes in the character of an amiable and simple-minded Nonconformist clergyman. His broad black hat, his baggy trousers, his white tie, his sympathetic smile, and general look of peering and benevolent curiosity were such as Mr. John Hare alone could have equalled. It was not merely that Holmes changed his costume. His expression, his manner, his very soul seemed to vary with every fresh part that he assumed. The stage lost a fine actor, even as science lost an acute reasoner, when he became a specialist in crime.\nIt was a quarter past six when we left Baker Street, and it still wanted ten minutes to the hour when we found ourselves in Serpentine Avenue. It was already dusk, and the lamps were just being lighted as we paced up and down in front of Briony Lodge, waiting for the coming of its occupant. The house was just such as I had pictured it from Sherlock Holmes’ succinct description, but the locality appeared to be less private than I expected. On the contrary, for a small street in a quiet neighbourhood, it was remarkably animated. There was a group of shabbily dressed men smoking and laughing in a corner, a scissors-grinder with his wheel, two guardsmen who were flirting with a nurse-girl, and several well-dressed young men who were lounging up and down with cigars in their mouths.\n“You see,” remarked Holmes, as we paced to and fro in front of the house, “this marriage rather simplifies matters. The photograph becomes a double-edged weapon now. The chances are that she would be as averse to its being seen by Mr. Godfrey Norton, as our client is to its coming to the eyes of his princess. Now the question is, Where are we to find the photograph?”\n“Where, indeed?”\n“It is most unlikely that she carries it about with her. It is cabinet size. Too large for easy concealment about a woman’s dress. She knows that the King is capable of having her waylaid and searched. Two attempts of the sort have already been made. We may take it, then, that she does not carry it about with her.”\n“Where, then?”\n“Her banker or her lawyer. There is that double possibility. But I am inclined to think neither. Women are naturally secretive, and they like to do their own secreting. Why should she hand it over to anyone else? She could trust her own guardianship, but she could not tell what indirect or political influence might be brought to bear upon a business man. Besides, remember that she had resolved to use it within a few days. It must be where she can lay her hands upon it. It must be in her own house.”\n“But it has twice been burgled.”\n“Pshaw! They did not know how to look.”\n“But how will you look?”\n“I will not look.”\n“What then?”\n“I will get her to show me.”\n“But she will refuse.”\n“She will not be able to. But I hear the rumble of wheels. It is her carriage. Now carry out my orders to the letter.”",
          "paraphrase_gemini-2.5-flash-preview-04-17": "“Excellent,” he replied. “I believe it's nearly time for me to prepare for my upcoming role.” He went into his bedroom and reappeared shortly after, looking like a kind and unassuming Nonconformist preacher. His appearance—including his wide black hat, loose trousers, white tie, pleasant smile, and a general air of inquisitive benevolence—was so convincing that perhaps only the actor Mr. John Hare could have matched it. It wasn't just the change of clothes; Holmes's expression, demeanor, and seemingly his entire essence transformed with every new character he adopted. The theatre world lost a superb actor, just as science lost a sharp analytical mind, when he chose to specialize in solving crimes. We left Baker Street at a quarter past six, and were in Serpentine Avenue ten minutes before the hour. It was already getting dark, and the streetlights were just being lit as we walked back and forth in front of Briony Lodge, awaiting its resident. The house looked exactly as I had imagined based on Sherlock Holmes’ brief description, but the area seemed less secluded than I had anticipated. In fact, for a small street in a quiet neighbourhood, it was surprisingly lively. There was a group of poorly dressed men smoking and laughing in one corner, a sharpener with his grinding wheel, two soldiers flirting with a nursemaid, and several well-dressed young men strolling about, puffing on cigars. “You see,” Holmes commented as we continued our pacing, “this marriage simplifies things considerably. The photograph is now a problem for both sides. It’s highly likely she would be as unwilling for Mr. Godfrey Norton to see it as our client is for his princess to see it. The main question now is, where can we find the photograph?” “Where, indeed?” I echoed. “It’s highly improbable she’s carrying it with her. It’s cabinet size, too large to easily hide in a woman’s clothing. She knows the King is capable of having her intercepted and searched, as two such attempts have already occurred. Therefore, we can assume she isn't carrying it.” “Where, then?” “Her bank or her lawyer. Those are two possibilities. However, I tend to believe it’s neither. Women are naturally private and prefer to handle their own secrets. Why would she entrust it to someone else? She could trust her own care, but couldn't be sure what indirect or political pressures a businessman might face. Also, remember she planned to use it within a few days. It must be somewhere she can access it easily. It must be in her own house.” “But it has been burgled twice.” “Nonsense! They didn’t know how to search properly.” “But how will you search?” “I won’t.” “What will you do, then?” “I will get her to show me.” “But she will refuse.” “She will not be able to. But I hear the sound of wheels. It’s her carriage. Now, follow my instructions precisely.”",
          "paraphrase_gpt-4.1-2025-04-14": "\"That’s excellent. I suppose it’s time I get ready for the new part I must play.\" Holmes hopped into his bedroom and, in just a few minutes, came back completely transformed into a friendly, somewhat naïve Nonconformist clergyman. He wore a wide, black hat, loose trousers, a white tie, and wore a kindly smile; everything about him—down to his inquisitive yet gentle manner—was so convincing it could only have rivaled Mr. John Hare’s stage performances. But the transformation went far beyond just clothes—Holmes’s face, demeanor, even his very being seemed to shift with each character he embodied. When he chose detective work over acting, the stage truly lost a remarkable performer, just as science lost a sharp thinker.\n\nIt was 6:15 when we left Baker Street, and about ten minutes before the hour when we reached Serpentine Avenue. Evening was closing in and the street lights had just come on as we walked up and down before Briony Lodge, waiting for its owner to appear. The house matched Holmes’s brief description perfectly, but the neighbourhood was livelier than I had anticipated for such a quiet area. In the street corner, some poorly dressed men were joking and smoking, a man with a scissors-grinding wheel was plying his trade, two guardsmen flirted with a nursemaid, and several smartly dressed young men wandered, chewing cigars.\n\nAs we strolled in front of the house, Holmes remarked, \"This marriage actually makes things easier. Now the photograph is a threat to both parties: she wouldn’t want Mr. Godfrey Norton to see it any more than our client wants it shown to his princess. So, the question is—where is this photograph?\"\n\n\"Where could it be?\" I asked.\n\n\"It’s very unlikely she keeps it on her. The photo is large—cabinet size—not easily hidden in a woman’s clothes. She knows the King could have her searched, and he’s already tried twice. So we can assume she doesn’t carry it around.\"\n\n\"Then where is it?\"\n\n\"Perhaps with her banker or lawyer—those are the two main possibilities. Still, I doubt it; women are naturally secretive and prefer to hide their valuables themselves. Why entrust it to someone else? She could rely on herself, but a banker or lawyer could be influenced. Plus, since she meant to use it within a few days, she needs quick access. It must be in her own house.\"\n\n\"But her house was broken into twice.\"\n\n\"Nonsense! The burglars didn’t know how to find it.\"\n\n\"Then how will you find it?\"\n\n\"I won’t search for it.\"\n\n\"What will you do, then?\"\n\n\"I’ll get her to reveal its location to me.\"\n\n\"But she’ll never do that!\"\n\n\"She won’t be able to stop herself. But listen, a carriage approaches—that must be her. Now, be sure to follow my instructions exactly.\""

They were a gang, and a rough one, too. Ah, he’s breathing now.”\n“He can’t lie in the street. May we bring him in, marm?”\n“Surely. Bring him into the sitting-room. There is a comfortable sofa. This way, please!”\nSlowly and solemnly he was borne into Briony Lodge and laid out in the principal room, while I still observed the proceedings from my post by the window. The lamps had been lit, but the blinds had not been drawn, so that I could see Holmes as he lay upon the couch. I do not know whether he was seized with compunction at that moment for the part he was playing, but I know that I never felt more heartily ashamed of myself in my life than when I saw the beautiful creature against whom I was conspiring, or the grace and kindliness with which she waited upon the injured man. And yet it would be the blackest treachery to Holmes to draw back now from the part which he had intrusted to me. I hardened my heart, and took the smoke-rocket from under my ulster. After all, I thought, we are not injuring her. We are but preventing her from injuring another.\nHolmes had sat up upon the couch, and I saw him motion like a man who is in need of air. A maid rushed across and threw open the window. At the same instant I saw him raise his hand and at the signal I tossed my rocket into the room with a cry of “Fire!” The word was no sooner out of my mouth than the whole crowd of spectators, well dressed and ill—gentlemen, ostlers, and servant maids—joined in a general shriek of “Fire!” Thick clouds of smoke curled through the room and out at the open window. I caught a glimpse of rushing figures, and a moment later the voice of Holmes from within assuring them that it was a false alarm. Slipping through the shouting crowd I made my way to the corner of the street, and in ten minutes was rejoiced to find my friend’s arm in mine, and to get away from the scene of uproar.",

Several voices exclaimed that he was dead, but another disputed this, shouting that he was still alive, though unlikely to survive before reaching a hospital. A woman praised him, stating he was courageous and had saved the lady's purse and watch from a vicious gang, noting he was now breathing. Asked if they could bring him inside, the lady of the house readily agreed, directing them to the sitting-room and a comfortable sofa. He was carried slowly and solemnly into Briony Lodge's main room and placed on the couch, while I continued observing from my window position. The lamps were lit, but the blinds remained open, allowing me to see Holmes on the sofa. I wasn't sure if he felt regret for his role at that moment, but I was profoundly ashamed of myself, seeing the lovely woman we were plotting against and witnessing her grace and kindness as she attended to the supposedly injured man. Yet, abandoning the part Holmes had entrusted to me now would be a terrible betrayal. I steeled myself, retrieving the smoke-rocket hidden under my coat. I reasoned that we weren't harming her, only stopping her from potentially harming another. Holmes sat up on the couch and gestured as if needing air. A maid quickly opened the window. At that exact moment, I saw him raise his hand; taking this as the signal, I threw my rocket into the room, yelling \"Fire!\" As soon as I shouted the word, the entire crowd outside—gentlemen, stable hands, and servants, well-dressed and not—joined in a collective scream of \"Fire!\" Thick smoke billowed through the room and out the open window. I briefly saw people rushing around, and shortly after, heard Holmes inside assuring everyone it was a false alarm. Weaving my way through the shouting crowd, I went to the street corner and was relieved within ten minutes to have my friend's arm in mine as we got away from the chaotic scene.",

They were a nasty gang. Look, he’s breathing now.”\n\n“He can’t just be left here in the street. Can we take him inside, ma’am?”\n\n“Of course. Bring him into the sitting-room; there’s a comfortable sofa in there. This way, please!”\n\nHe was carried slowly and respectfully into Briony Lodge and placed in the main room, while I continued to watch everything from my vantage point by the window. The lamps inside were already lit, but the curtains hadn’t been closed, allowing me to see Holmes as he lay on the sofa. I wondered if he felt any guilt at that moment over the deception we were carrying out, but I knew that I had never felt so deeply ashamed of myself as I did while watching the graceful and kind woman we were plotting against, especially as she tended to the injured man. Still, it would feel like a terrible betrayal to Holmes if I were to abandon the task he’d given me. So, I steeled myself, pulled the smoke-rocket from under my coat, and reminded myself that we weren’t harming her—only stopping her from injuring someone else.\n\nHolmes sat up on the sofa, gesturing as though he needed some fresh air. Immediately, a maid hurried over and opened the window. At the same time, I saw Holmes signal to me, and I threw the smoke-rocket into the room while shouting, “Fire!” As soon as I said it, the entire crowd of onlookers—regardless of their status or dress—responded in a chorus of “Fire!” Thick smoke filled the room and drifted out the open window. For a moment, I glimpsed people rushing about, then heard Holmes’s voice inside calming everyone, explaining it was a false alarm. Making my way through the panicked crowd, I got to the street corner, and, within ten minutes, was thrilled to find Holmes by my side and to leave the chaos behind us."

It is all right.”\n“You have the photograph?”\n“I know where it is.”\n“And how did you find out?”\n“She showed me, as I told you she would.”\n“I am still in the dark.”\n“I do not wish to make a mystery,” said he, laughing. “The matter was perfectly simple. You, of course, saw that everyone in the street was an accomplice. They were all engaged for the evening.”\n“I guessed as much.”\n“Then, when the row broke out, I had a little moist red paint in the palm of my hand. I rushed forward, fell down, clapped my hand to my face, and became a piteous spectacle. It is an old trick.”\n“That also I could fathom.”\n“Then they carried me in. She was bound to have me in. What else could she do? And into her sitting-room, which was the very room which I suspected. It lay between that and her bedroom, and I was determined to see which. They laid me on a couch, I motioned for air, they were compelled to open the window, and you had your chance.”\n“How did that help you?”\n“It was all-important. When a woman thinks that her house is on fire, her instinct is at once to rush to the thing which she values most. It is a perfectly overpowering impulse, and I have more than once taken advantage of it. In the case of the Darlington Substitution Scandal it was of use to me, and also in the Arnsworth Castle business. A married woman grabs at her baby; an unmarried one reaches for her jewel-box. Now it was clear to me that our lady of to-day had nothing in the house more precious to her than what we are in quest of. She would rush to secure it. The alarm of fire was admirably done. The smoke and shouting were enough to shake nerves of steel. She responded beautifully. The photograph is in a recess behind a sliding panel just above the right bell-pull. She was there in an instant, and I caught a glimpse of it as she half drew it out. When I cried out that it was a false alarm, she replaced it, glanced at the rocket, rushed from the room, and I have not seen her since. I rose, and, making my excuses, escaped from the house. I hesitated whether to attempt to secure the photograph at once; but the coachman had come in, and as he was watching me narrowly, it seemed safer to wait. A little over-precipitance may ruin all.”\n“And now?” I asked.\n“Our quest is practically finished. I shall call with the King to-morrow, and with you, if you care to come with us. We will be shown into the sitting-room to wait for the lady, but it is probable that when she comes she may find neither us nor the photograph. It might be a satisfaction to his Majesty to regain it with his own hands.”\n“And when will you call?”\n“At eight in the morning. She will not be up, so that we shall have a clear field. Besides, we must be prompt, for this marriage may mean a complete change in her life and habits. I must wire to the King without delay.”",

Holmes commented, 'You did that extremely well, Doctor. It couldn't have been improved upon. Everything is satisfactory.' 'Do you possess the photograph?' I inquired. 'I know its location,' he replied. 'And how did you ascertain that?' I asked. 'She revealed it to me, just as I predicted she would,' he said. 'I am still perplexed,' I admitted. 'I see no reason to create mystery,' he responded with a laugh. 'The matter was entirely straightforward. You surely observed that everyone in the street was assisting? They were all hired for the evening's activities.' 'I had guessed as much,' I confirmed. 'Then, when the commotion erupted,' he continued, 'I had a small amount of damp red paint in the palm of my hand. I rushed forward, pretended to fall, covered my face with my hand, and presented a pathetic sight. It's a well-worn tactic.' 'That part I could also understand,' I said. 'They then carried me inside,' he explained. 'She was compelled to let me in. What alternative did she have? And into her sitting-room, which was precisely the room I suspected. The choice lay between that room and her bedroom, and I was determined to confirm its identity. They placed me on a sofa, I indicated a need for air, they were obliged to open the window, and that provided you with your opportunity.' 'How did that particular action benefit you?' I asked. 'It was absolutely crucial,' he stated. 'When a woman believes her home is on fire, her immediate impulse is to rush to the object she values most highly. It's an utterly compelling instinct, and I have taken advantage of it more than once. It proved useful to me in the Darlington Substitution Scandal, and also in the Arnsworth Castle affair. A married woman will grab her baby; an unmarried one will reach for her jewellery box. In this case, it was obvious to me that our lady today possessed nothing in the house more precious to her than the item we are seeking. She would inevitably hurry to secure it. The fire alarm was executed perfectly. The smoke and shouting were sufficient to shake nerves of steel. She reacted beautifully. The photograph is situated in a recess behind a sliding panel just above the right bell-pull. She was there instantly, and I caught a fleeting glimpse of it as she partially pulled it out. When I called out that it was a false alarm, she replaced it, cast a look at the signal rocket, rushed out of the room, and I have not seen her since. I stood up, offered my apologies, and departed the house. I considered attempting to secure the photograph immediately, but the coachman had entered and was observing me closely, so it seemed wiser to wait. A little too much haste can ruin everything.' 'And what is the next step?' I inquired. 'Our objective is virtually achieved,' he replied. 'I shall call tomorrow with the King, and you too, if you wish to accompany us. We will be shown into the sitting-room to await the lady, but it is quite possible that when she arrives, she may find neither us nor the photograph there. It might provide satisfaction to his Majesty to reclaim it with his own hands.' 'And at what time will you call?' I asked. 'At eight in the morning,' he said. 'She will not be awake yet, allowing us a clear opportunity. Moreover, we must be prompt, as this impending marriage could mean a complete transformation in her life and habits. I must send a telegram to the King without delay.'",

After a while, he turned to me and said, “You handled things excellently, Doctor. Everything worked out perfectly.”\n\n“Do you have the photograph?” I asked.\n\n“I know its location,” he replied.\n\n“How did you figure it out?”\n\n“She revealed it to me, just as I expected she would.”\n\n“I still don’t understand everything,” I admitted.\n\nHe laughed and said, “There’s nothing mysterious about it. The solution was straightforward. You must have noticed that everyone outside was in on the plan; they had all been hired for this purpose.”\n\n“I suspected as much,” I said.\n\n“When the commotion erupted, I had some wet red paint in my palm. I rushed forward as if helping, pretended to fall, pressed my hand to my face, and looked like I was seriously hurt—it’s a classic ruse.”\n\n“I figured that part out too,” I agreed.\n\n“They carried me into the house, as I knew they would. There was little else she could do. They brought me right into her sitting-room—the room I thought most likely. It’s positioned between the other rooms, and I wanted to confirm which. They laid me on a sofa, I gestured for air, and as a result, they had to open a window, giving you your chance.”\n\n“And that helped how?” I asked.\n\n“It was crucial. Women instinctively run for what they treasure most when they think their house is on fire. It’s a powerful, natural reaction—and one I’ve utilized before, like in the Darlington Substitution Scandal and the Arnsworth Castle affair. Married women grab their children, unmarried ones go for jewelry. I guessed that what she would protect most was our target. The fire alarm was convincing enough—lots of noise and smoke to agitate even the bravest person. She acted exactly as expected. The photograph is hidden in a recess behind a sliding panel, above the right bell-pull. I saw her reach for it when the alarm was raised. When I called out that it was a false alarm, she put the photo back, glanced at the light, ran from the room, and I didn’t see her after that. I apologized and left, debating whether to take the photograph right then, but since the coachman was watching closely, I thought it safer to wait. Acting too quickly could spoil everything.”\n\n“So what’s next?” I asked.\n\n“Our goal is nearly achieved. Tomorrow, the King will accompany me—you’re welcome as well. We’ll be shown into the sitting-room to await her arrival, but if all goes well, she’ll find neither us nor the photograph when she comes. The King might enjoy retrieving it himself.”\n\n“When will you go?”\n\n“At eight in the morning—before she’s awake, so we’ll have free access. We must hurry; her upcoming marriage could soon change everything. I’ll send a telegram to the King straightaway.”"

My mistress told me that you were likely to call.

But, you know, I have been trained as an actress myself. Male costume is nothing new to me. I often take advantage of the freedom which it gives. I sent John, the coachman, to watch you, ran upstairs, got into my walking clothes, as I call them, and came down just as you departed.\n    “Well, I followed you to your door, and so made sure that I was really an object of interest to the celebrated Mr. Sherlock Holmes. Then I, rather imprudently, wished you good-night, and started for the Temple to see my husband.\n    “We both thought the best resource was flight, when pursued by so formidable an antagonist; so you will find the nest empty when you call to-morrow.

She mentions having been warned about him months earlier, told he was likely the King's agent, and even given his address, yet despite this, he still successfully extracted the information he needed. She found it hard to suspect the kind old clergyman disguise even after becoming wary. Using her training as an actress, which includes familiarity and comfort with male attire, she recounts sending her coachman to observe him while she quickly changed into her walking clothes and followed him as he left. She pursued him to his residence, confirming that she was indeed a person of importance to the famous Sherlock Holmes. After perhaps unwisely wishing him goodnight, she proceeded to the Temple to meet her husband. Believing that fleeing was the best course of action against such a formidable opponent, they decided to leave, so he would find their home vacant the following day. Regarding the photograph, she assures him his client can rest easy, stating she is loved by a better man than the King and will not interfere with the King, despite having been cruelly wronged by him.

That made me think back, recalling that I was warned about you months before and told that, should the King choose an agent, it would surely be you. Even with your address known to me, you still managed to extract the information you sought. Once I suspected, I still found it difficult to distrust someone who played such a kindly, elderly clergyman. However, as you know, acting is my profession, and disguises—especially in men’s attire—are nothing new to me. I used the opportunity: I asked John, my coachman, to keep an eye on you, hurried upstairs to change into my usual walking outfit, and came back down shortly after you left.\nI followed you home and confirmed your interest in me. Perhaps unwisely, I wished you good-night before heading to the Temple to meet my husband.\nOnce we understood you were after us—someone as formidable as yourself—we agreed the best course was to leave at once. So tomorrow, when you look for us, our home will be empty. Concerning the photograph, your client needn’t worry. I am in love with, and loved by, a far better man than he, and the King—who wronged me—can do as he pleases without interference. I keep the photograph only as a means of protection, to guard myself from any actions he might attempt. I have left a photograph he may wish to have, and so, dear Mr. Sherlock Holmes, I remain yours sincerely, Irene Norton, formerly Adler."

Very much so.”\n“Then I can wait in the next room.”\n“Not at all. This gentleman, Mr. Wilson, has been my partner and helper in many of my most successful cases, and I have no doubt that he will be of the utmost use to me in yours also.”\nThe stout gentleman half rose from his chair and gave a bob of greeting, with a quick little questioning glance from his small fat-encircled eyes.\n“Try the settee,” said Holmes, relapsing into his armchair and putting his fingertips together, as was his custom when in judicial moods. “I know, my dear Watson, that you share my love of all that is bizarre and outside the conventions and humdrum routine of everyday life. You have shown your relish for it by the enthusiasm which has prompted you to chronicle, and, if you will excuse my saying so, somewhat to embellish so many of my own little adventures.”\n“Your cases have indeed been of the greatest interest to me,” I observed.\n“You will remember that I remarked the other day, just before we went into the very simple problem presented by Miss Mary Sutherland, that for strange effects and extraordinary combinations we must go to life itself, which is always far more daring than any effort of the imagination.”\n“A proposition which I took the liberty of doubting.”\n“You did, Doctor, but none the less you must come round to my view, for otherwise I shall keep on piling fact upon fact on you until your reason breaks down under them and acknowledges me to be right. Now, Mr. Jabez Wilson here has been good enough to call upon me this morning, and to begin a narrative which promises to be one of the most singular which I have listened to for some time. You have heard me remark that the strangest and most unique things are very often connected not with the larger but with the smaller crimes, and occasionally, indeed, where there is room for doubt whether any positive crime has been committed. As far as I have heard, it is impossible for me to say whether the present case is an instance of crime or not, but the course of events is certainly among the most singular that I have ever listened to. Perhaps, Mr. Wilson, you would have the great kindness to recommence your narrative. I ask you not merely because my friend Dr. Watson has not heard the opening part but also because the peculiar nature of the story makes me anxious to have every possible detail from your lips. As a rule, when I have heard some slight indication of the course of events, I am able to guide myself by the thousands of other similar cases which occur to my memory.

Your eagerness to write about my various minor cases, even perhaps adding a touch of flair, shows how much you enjoy it.\" \"Your investigations have always been extremely interesting to me,\" I remarked. \"You might recall,\" he said, \"that recently, just before tackling the straightforward matter involving Miss Mary Sutherland, I pointed out that to find truly odd occurrences and remarkable circumstances, one must look to real life, which is invariably bolder than anything one can invent.\" \"A claim I ventured to dispute,\" I responded. \"You did, Doctor,\" Holmes agreed, \"but you'll eventually have to agree with me, because otherwise I'll overwhelm you with so many facts that your mind will be forced to accept I'm correct. Now, Mr. Jabez Wilson has kindly visited me this morning and started telling a story that appears to be one of the most extraordinary I've heard in a while. You've heard me mention before that the most unusual and unique situations often arise not from major crimes but minor ones, or even where it's unclear if a crime has occurred at all. Based on what I've heard so far, I can't say if this case involves a crime, but the sequence of events is definitely one of the strangest I've ever encountered. Mr. Wilson, would you be so kind as to start your story again? I ask this not just because my friend Dr. Watson missed the beginning, but also because the unusual quality of the tale makes me eager to hear every single detail directly from you.

My friend Mr. Wilson here has assisted me in some of my best cases, and I'm sure he'll be very helpful with yours as well.\"\n\nMr. Wilson, the portly gentleman, stood partially to greet me, glancing at me inquisitively with his eyes nearly lost in flesh.\n\n\"Please, take the sofa,\" said Holmes, settling into his chair with his usual thoughtful pose. \"Watson, I know you share my fascination for the unusual and the extraordinary.

For now, I can't say if what Mr. Wilson describes is truly criminal, but the details are certainly unusual. Mr. Wilson, would you kindly start from the beginning again—not only so that Dr. Watson can hear, but also because the nature of your case makes every detail important. Usually, if I get some hints, I can draw upon similar past cases, but in this situation, the facts seem quite original to me.\""

As he glanced down the advertisement column, with his head thrust forward and the paper flattened out upon his knee, I took a good look at the man and endeavoured, after the fashion of my companion, to read the indications which might be presented by his dress or appearance.\nI did not gain very much, however, by my inspection. Our visitor bore every mark of being an average commonplace British tradesman, obese, pompous, and slow. He wore rather baggy grey shepherd’s check trousers, a not over-clean black frock-coat, unbuttoned in the front, and a drab waistcoat with a heavy brassy Albert chain, and a square pierced bit of metal dangling down as an ornament. A frayed top-hat and a faded brown overcoat with a wrinkled velvet collar lay upon a chair beside him. Altogether, look as I would, there was nothing remarkable about the man save his blazing red head, and the expression of extreme chagrin and discontent upon his features.\nSherlock Holmes’ quick eye took in my occupation, and he shook his head with a smile as he noticed my questioning glances. “Beyond the obvious facts that he has at some time done manual labour, that he takes snuff, that he is a Freemason, that he has been in China, and that he has done a considerable amount of writing lately, I can deduce nothing else.”\nMr. Jabez Wilson started up in his chair, with his forefinger upon the paper, but his eyes upon my companion.\n“How, in the name of good-fortune, did you know all that, Mr. Holmes?” he asked. “How did you know, for example, that I did manual labour. It’s as true as gospel, for I began as a ship’s carpenter.”\n“Your hands, my dear sir. Your right hand is quite a size larger than your left. You have worked with it, and the muscles are more developed.”\n“Well, the snuff, then, and the Freemasonry?”\n“I won’t insult your intelligence by telling you how I read that, especially as, rather against the strict rules of your order, you use an arc-and-compass breastpin.”\n“Ah, of course, I forgot that. But the writing?”\n“What else can be indicated by that right cuff so very shiny for five inches, and the left one with the smooth patch near the elbow where you rest it upon the desk?”\n“Well, but China?”\n“The fish that you have tattooed immediately above your right wrist could only have been done in China. I have made a small study of tattoo marks and have even contributed to the literature of the subject. That trick of staining the fishes’ scales of a delicate pink is quite peculiar to China. When, in addition, I see a Chinese coin hanging from your watch-chain, the matter becomes even more simple.”\nMr. Jabez Wilson laughed heavily. “Well, I never!” said he.",
          "paraphrase_gemini-2.5-flash-preview-04-17": "Displaying a touch of self-importance, the somewhat overweight client extended his chest and took out a creased, soiled newspaper from the inner pocket of his heavy coat. As he studied the advertisements, leaning his head forward and smoothing the paper flat on his knee, I closely examined the man, attempting, like my companion, to infer characteristics from his clothing and look. My observations didn't reveal much, though. Our visitor seemed like a typical, ordinary British shopkeeper—plump, self-satisfied, and unhurried. He wore rather loose grey trousers with a checked pattern, a not-very-clean black tailcoat left open at the front, and a dull waistcoat with a bulky brass Albert chain from which a decorative, pierced metal piece hung. A worn-out top hat and a faded brown overcoat with a wrinkled velvet collar were placed on a chair beside him. No matter how hard I looked, there was nothing particularly striking about the man except for his bright red hair and the clear expression of significant annoyance and unhappiness on his face. Sherlock Holmes quickly noticed what I was doing and smiled, shaking his head as he saw my curious glances. \"Aside from the clear facts that he's previously done physical work, uses snuff, is a Freemason, has visited China, and has written a considerable amount recently,\" Holmes stated, \"I can't deduce anything else.\" Mr. Jabez Wilson jumped slightly in his chair, his finger still on the newspaper but his eyes now fixed on Holmes. \"For heaven's sake, Mr. Holmes, how did you figure all that out?\" he asked. \"How did you know, for instance, that I used to do manual labour? It's completely true; I started as a ship's carpenter.\" \"Your hands, my dear fellow,\" Holmes replied. \"Your right hand is noticeably bigger than your left. You've used it for work, and the muscles are more developed.\" \"Okay, what about the snuff, then, and the Freemasonry?\" Wilson pressed. \"I won't insult your intelligence by explaining how I knew that,\" Holmes said, \"especially since, somewhat against the strict rules of your group, you wear an arc-and-compass badge on your lapel.\" \"Oh, right, I forgot about that. But how did you know about the writing?\" Wilson asked. \"What else could explain the right cuff being so remarkably shiny for about five inches, and the left one having that smooth spot near the elbow where you rest it on a desk?\" Holmes explained. \"Alright, but what about China?\" Wilson questioned further. \"The fish tattooed just above your right wrist,\" Holmes answered, \"could only have been done in China. I've studied tattoos a bit and even written on the topic. That technique of colouring the fish scales a delicate pink is unique to China. When I also see a Chinese coin hanging from your watch chain, it becomes even more straightforward.\" Mr. Jabez Wilson let out a loud laugh. \"Well, I'll be!\" he exclaimed.",
          "paraphrase_gpt-4.1-2025-04-14": "The stout client drew himself up with a hint of pride before pulling out an old, creased newspaper from his greatcoat. As he carefully searched the advertisement section, bending forward with the newspaper spread across his knee, I seized the opportunity to study him and, inspired by Holmes, tried to deduce details about him from his clothes and appearance. However, I found little of note—he looked every bit the typical British tradesman: overweight, self-important, and rather slow. His attire consisted of loose grey checkered trousers, a not-so-clean black open frock-coat, a dull waistcoat with a heavy brass watch-chain, and a decorative piece of metal attached. His well-worn top-hat and faded brown overcoat with a rumpled velvet collar were placed nearby. Altogether, there was nothing extraordinary about him except for his fiery red hair and an expression of deep disappointment and unhappiness. Holmes, noticing my attempt at deduction, smiled at me and remarked, 'Other than the evident facts that this man once did manual labor, uses snuff, is a Freemason, visited China, and has been writing a lot lately, I can't deduce anything more.' At this, Mr. Jabez Wilson, surprised, questioned, 'How in the world did you figure that out, Mr. Holmes? For example, how did you know about the manual labor? It’s absolutely true—I started as a ship’s carpenter.' Holmes replied, 'Your hands, sir—your right hand is noticeably bigger and more muscular from use.' Wilson then asked about the snuff and Freemasonry, to which Holmes explained that the client wore a Freemason’s pin, and there were other obvious clues he wouldn't elaborate on. To the question about writing, Holmes pointed out the shiny right cuff and the worn spot on the left sleeve, signs of frequent desk work. Regarding China, Holmes cited the distinctive fish tattoo above Wilson’s wrist—a style unique to China—and the Chinese coin on his watch-chain as proof. Wilson laughed heartily in amazement."

It's hard to guess how old he really is. I couldn't ask for a brighter assistant, Mr. Holmes. I know for certain he could find a better position and make twice what I pay him. Still, if he's content, why should I try to change his mind?\" \n\"Indeed, you seem quite lucky to have an employee who works for less than the going rate.

Spaulding, he came down into the office just this day eight weeks, with this very paper in his hand, and he says:\n“‘I wish to the Lord, Mr. Wilson, that I was a red-headed man.’\n“‘Why that?’ I asks.\n“‘Why,’ says he, ‘here’s another vacancy on the League of the Red-headed Men. It’s worth quite a little fortune to any man who gets it, and I understand that there are more vacancies than there are men, so that the trustees are at their wits’ end what to do with the money. If my hair would only change colour, here’s a nice little crib all ready for me to step into.’\n“‘Why, what is it, then?’ I asked. You see, Mr. Holmes, I am a very stay-at-home man, and as my business came to me instead of my having to go to it, I was often weeks on end without putting my foot over the door-mat. In that way I didn’t know much of what was going on outside, and I was always glad of a bit of news.\n“‘Have you never heard of the League of the Red-headed Men?’ he asked with his eyes open.\n“‘Never.’\n“‘Why, I wonder at that, for you are eligible yourself for one of the vacancies.’\n“‘And what are they worth?’ I asked.\n“‘Oh, merely a couple of hundred a year, but the work is slight, and it need not interfere very much with one’s other occupations.’\n“Well, you can easily think that that made me prick up my ears, for the business has not been over good for some years, and an extra couple of hundred would have been very handy.\n“‘Tell me all about it,’ said I.\n“‘Well,’ said he, showing me the advertisement, ‘you can see for yourself that the League has a vacancy, and there is the address where you should apply for particulars. As far as I can make out, the League was founded by an American millionaire, Ezekiah Hopkins, who was very peculiar in his ways. He was himself red-headed, and he had a great sympathy for all red-headed men; so, when he died, it was found that he had left his enormous fortune in the hands of trustees, with instructions to apply the interest to the providing of easy berths to men whose hair is of that colour. From all I hear it is splendid pay and very little to do.’\n“‘But,’ said I, ‘there would be millions of red-headed men who would apply.’\n“‘Not so many as you might think,’ he answered. ‘You see it is really confined to Londoners, and to grown men. This American had started from London when he was young, and he wanted to do the old town a good turn. Then, again, I have heard it is no use your applying if your hair is light red, or dark red, or anything but real bright, blazing, fiery red. Now, if you cared to apply, Mr. Wilson, you would just walk in; but perhaps it would hardly be worth your while to put yourself out of the way for the sake of a few hundred pounds.’\n“Now, it is a fact, gentlemen, as you may see for yourselves, that my hair is of a very full and rich tint, so that it seemed to me that if there was to be any competition in the matter I stood as good a chance as any man that I had ever met. Vincent Spaulding seemed to know so much about it that I thought he might prove useful, so I just ordered him to put up the shutters for the day and to come right away with me. He was very willing to have a holiday, so we shut the business up and started off for the address that was given us in the advertisement.\n“I never hope to see such a sight as that again, Mr. Holmes. From north, south, east, and west every man who had a shade of red in his hair had tramped into the city to answer the advertisement. Fleet Street was choked with red-headed folk, and Pope’s Court looked like a coster’s orange barrow. I should not have thought there were so many in the whole country as were brought together by that single advertisement. Every shade of colour they were—straw, lemon, orange, brick, Irish-setter, liver, clay; but, as Spaulding said, there were not many who had the real vivid flame-coloured tint. When I saw how many were waiting, I would have given it up in despair; but Spaulding would not hear of it. How he did it I could not imagine, but he pushed and pulled and butted until he got me through the crowd, and right up to the steps which led to the office. There was a double stream upon the stair, some going up in hope, and some coming back dejected; but we wedged in as well as we could and soon found ourselves in the office.”",
          "paraphrase_gemini-2.5-flash-preview-04-17": "Mr. Wilson explained that their initial surprise came from an advertisement. Exactly eight weeks prior, Spaulding entered his office holding the newspaper and exclaimed, “I sincerely wish I had red hair, Mr. Wilson.” When Mr. Wilson asked why, Spaulding replied that there was a new opening in the League of the Red-headed Men. He claimed it was quite lucrative and that there were apparently more positions available than suitable applicants, leaving the trustees struggling to distribute the funds. He added that if his hair were a different color, he’d easily step into such a role. Curious, Mr. Wilson inquired further, explaining to Holmes that he was a homebody whose work came to him, so he often spent weeks indoors and was eager for outside news. Spaulding seemed astonished that he hadn't heard of the League of the Red-headed Men, especially since Mr. Wilson himself qualified for a position. Mr. Wilson asked about the pay, and Spaulding mentioned it was only a couple of hundred pounds annually, but the work was minimal and wouldn't interfere much with other jobs. This piqued Mr. Wilson's interest, as his business hadn't been thriving for years, and the extra money would be very useful. He asked Spaulding to explain everything. Spaulding showed him the advertisement, pointing out the vacancy and the address for applications. He explained that the League was reportedly founded by a quirky American millionaire named Ezekiah Hopkins, who had red hair and a strong affinity for others with the same trait. Upon his death, he left a vast fortune with instructions for the interest to be used to provide easy jobs for men with red hair. Spaulding added that it was said to be excellent pay for very little effort. Mr. Wilson raised the point that millions of red-headed men would surely apply. Spaulding countered that the pool was more limited than one might think, primarily restricted to adult men living in London. He explained that the American had started his life in London and wanted to benefit the city. Furthermore, he had heard that applications were only successful if the hair was a truly vibrant, fiery red, not just light or dark red. Spaulding commented that Mr. Wilson, with his hair, would easily get in but perhaps wouldn't bother for just a few hundred pounds. Mr. Wilson noted that, as Holmes could observe, his hair was indeed a very rich color, so he felt he had as good a chance as anyone. Since Vincent Spaulding seemed so knowledgeable, Mr. Wilson thought he could be helpful and instructed him to close the shop for the day and accompany him. Spaulding was happy for a break, so they shut up the business and went to the address listed in the advertisement. Mr. Wilson told Holmes he hoped never to witness such a scene again. Men with every shade of red hair from all directions had flocked into the city to respond to the ad. Fleet Street was packed with them, and Pope’s Court was a sea of red heads. He never imagined so many existed in the entire country. The hair colors ranged from straw and lemon to orange, brick, Irish-setter, liver, and clay, but as Spaulding noted, few had the truly vivid, flame-like shade. Seeing the enormous crowd, Mr. Wilson felt like giving up, but Spaulding insisted they try. Mr. Wilson couldn't figure out how, but Spaulding pushed, pulled, and nudged his way through the throng to the steps leading to the office. There was a constant flow of people on the stairs, some ascending hopefully, others descending discouraged. They squeezed in as best they could and soon reached the office.",
          "paraphrase_gpt-4.1-2025-04-14": "The thing that first caught our attention was that particular advertisement. Spaulding came into the office exactly eight weeks ago today, holding the newspaper, and said to me, ‘I wish I was a red-headed man, Mr. Wilson.’ I asked him why, and he explained that there was another job opening with the League of the Red-headed Men. Apparently, it offered a decent sum to anyone who got the position, and there weren't enough applicants, so the trustees were struggling to give the money away. He said if only his hair would turn red, he could have a good job with little effort. I asked what the job was, since I’m the kind of person who rarely leaves the house and doesn’t keep up with outside news. He was surprised I hadn’t heard of the League, since I was eligible myself. I asked what the job paid, and he replied that it was a few hundred pounds a year for minimal work that could be done alongside other jobs. Since my business hadn’t been doing great, earning extra money sounded appealing, so I asked for more details. Spaulding showed me the advertisement with the address for applications. He explained the League was started by an eccentric American millionaire, Ezekiah Hopkins, who was red-headed and left his fortune in trust to help other red-headed men with easy jobs. I asked if many people would apply, and he told me that not as many as I’d think, as it was limited to adult Londoners with vividly bright red hair. Since my hair fit the criteria, I thought I had a good chance, so I told Spaulding to close up the shop and come with me. He accepted happily, so we shut down and headed to the address. When we arrived, the number of red-haired men assembled was astonishing—there were people from all directions, with every possible shade of red hair. Fleet Street was packed, and Pope’s Court was crowded like a cart full of oranges. I wouldn’t have believed so many red-headed men existed if I hadn’t seen it myself. However, Spaulding noted that few had truly bright red hair. Even with that enormous crowd, Spaulding insisted we stay, and somehow he managed to push us through the masses until we reached the office entrance. There, lines of men were either going up in hope or coming down disappointed, but eventually, we squeezed into the office ourselves."

He said a few words to each candidate as he came up, and then he always managed to find some fault in them which would disqualify them. Getting a vacancy did not seem to be such a very easy matter, after all. However, when our turn came the little man was much more favourable to me than to any of the others, and he closed the door as we entered, so that he might have a private word with us.\n“‘This is Mr. Jabez Wilson,’ said my assistant, ‘and he is willing to fill a vacancy in the League.’\n“‘And he is admirably suited for it,’ the other answered. ‘He has every requirement. I cannot recall when I have seen anything so fine.’ He took a step backward, cocked his head on one side, and gazed at my hair until I felt quite bashful. Then suddenly he plunged forward, wrung my hand, and congratulated me warmly on my success.\n“‘It would be injustice to hesitate,’ said he. ‘You will, however, I am sure, excuse me for taking an obvious precaution.’ With that he seized my hair in both his hands, and tugged until I yelled with the pain. ‘There is water in your eyes,’ said he as he released me. ‘I perceive that all is as it should be. But we have to be careful, for we have twice been deceived by wigs and once by paint. I could tell you tales of cobbler’s wax which would disgust you with human nature.’ He stepped over to the window and shouted through it at the top of his voice that the vacancy was filled. A groan of disappointment came up from below, and the folk all trooped away in different directions until there was not a red-head to be seen except my own and that of the manager.\n“‘My name,’ said he, ‘is Mr. Duncan Ross, and I am myself one of the pensioners upon the fund left by our noble benefactor. Are you a married man, Mr. Wilson? Have you a family?’\n“I answered that I had not.\n“His face fell immediately.\n“‘Dear me!’ he said gravely, ‘that is very serious indeed! I am sorry to hear you say that. The fund was, of course, for the propagation and spread of the red-heads as well as for their maintenance. It is exceedingly unfortunate that you should be a bachelor.’\n“My face lengthened at this, Mr. Holmes, for I thought that I was not to have the vacancy after all; but after thinking it over for a few minutes he said that it would be all right.\n“‘In the case of another,’ said he, ‘the objection might be fatal, but we must stretch a point in favour of a man with such a head of hair as yours. When shall you be able to enter upon your new duties?’\n“‘Well, it is a little awkward, for I have a business already,’ said I.\n“‘Oh, never mind about that, Mr. Wilson!’ said Vincent Spaulding. ‘I should be able to look after that for you.’\n“‘What would be the hours?’ I asked.\n“‘Ten to two.’\n“Now a pawnbroker’s business is mostly done of an evening, Mr. Holmes, especially Thursday and Friday evening, which is just before pay-day; so it would suit me very well to earn a little in the mornings. Besides, I knew that my assistant was a good man, and that he would see to anything that turned up.\n“‘That would suit me very well,’ said I. ‘And the pay?’\n“‘Is £ 4 a week.’\n“‘And the work?’\n“‘Is purely nominal.’\n“‘What do you call purely nominal?’\n“‘Well, you have to be in the office, or at least in the building, the whole time. If you leave, you forfeit your whole position forever. The will is very clear upon that point. You don’t comply with the conditions if you budge from the office during that time.’\n“‘It’s only four hours a day, and I should not think of leaving,’ said I.\n“‘No excuse will avail,’ said Mr. Duncan Ross; ‘neither sickness nor business nor anything else. There you must stay, or you lose your billet.’\n“‘And the work?’\n“‘Is to copy out the Encyclopædia Britannica. There is the first volume of it in that press. You must find your own ink, pens, and blotting-paper, but we provide this table and chair. Will you be ready to-morrow?’\n“‘Certainly,’ I answered.\n“‘Then, good-bye, Mr. Jabez Wilson, and let me congratulate you once more on the important position which you have been fortunate enough to gain.’ He bowed me out of the room and I went home with my assistant, hardly knowing what to say or do, I was so pleased at my own good fortune.",

The office contained only two wooden chairs and a plain table, behind which sat a small man whose head was even redder than mine. This man spoke briefly to each candidate as they approached, but always found a reason to reject them. It seemed the position wasn't as easy to obtain as I had thought. However, when it was our turn, the small man was much more encouraging towards me than the others. He closed the door as we entered so he could speak to us privately. My assistant introduced me, saying, 'This is Mr. Jabez Wilson, and he wishes to apply for a position in the League.' The other man responded, 'And he is perfectly suited for it. He meets all the requirements. I can't remember seeing anything so impressive.' He stepped back, tilted his head, and stared at my hair, making me feel quite shy. Then, he suddenly stepped forward, shook my hand, and warmly congratulated me on getting the job. He said he shouldn't hesitate to hire me but needed to take a necessary precaution. With that, he grabbed my hair with both hands and pulled until I cried out in pain. As he let go, he noticed the tears in my eyes and said, 'I see everything is as it should be. But we have to be careful; we've been fooled by wigs twice and paint once. I could tell you stories about cobbler's wax that would make you sick of human nature.' He then went to the window and yelled at the top of his voice that the position was filled. A groan of disappointment came from below, and the crowd dispersed until only my red hair and the manager's remained visible. He introduced himself as Mr. Duncan Ross, stating he was also a recipient of the fund left by their benefactor. He asked if I was married and had a family. I replied that I was not. His face immediately fell. He said gravely that this was very serious indeed and he was sorry to hear it. He explained the fund was meant to promote and increase the population of red-heads, not just support them. He considered it very unfortunate that I was a bachelor. My face dropped at this, Mr. Holmes, as I feared I wouldn't get the job after all. But after a few minutes of thought, he said it would be acceptable. He explained that while this might disqualify someone else, they would make an exception for a man with such an excellent head of hair. He then asked when I could start my new duties. I mentioned it was slightly inconvenient as I already had a business. Vincent Spaulding immediately interjected, 'Oh, don't worry about that, Mr. Wilson! I can look after your business for you.' I asked about the hours. 'Ten to two,' he replied. I noted to Mr. Holmes that a pawnbroker's busiest time is usually in the evenings, especially Thursday and Friday before payday, so earning money in the mornings would suit me perfectly. Plus, I knew my assistant was reliable and could handle anything that came up. I confirmed, 'That would suit me very well.' I then asked about the pay. '£4 a week,' was the answer. 'And the work?' I asked. 'Is purely nominal.' When I inquired what 'purely nominal' meant, he explained, 'Well, you have to be in the office, or at least within the building, the entire time. If you leave, you lose your position permanently. The will is very clear on this. You don't meet the requirements if you leave the office during those hours.' I said that it was only four hours a day and I had no intention of leaving. Mr. Duncan Ross stressed that no excuse would be accepted – not sickness, nor business, nor anything else. You must remain there, or you lose the job. Regarding the work itself, he said it was to copy the Encyclopædia Britannica. He showed me the first volume in a cupboard. I would need to supply my own ink, pens, and blotting paper, but the table and chair were provided. He asked if I could start the next day. 'Certainly,' I replied. Then, he said goodbye, Mr. Jabez Wilson, and congratulated me again on securing such an important position through good fortune.

However, when it was their turn, the man was friendlier to the client, and, after closing the door for a private conversation, the client’s assistant introduced him as Jabez Wilson, eager to join the League. The red-haired manager declared Wilson perfect for the role, even admiring his hair closely. Without hesitation, he shook Wilson’s hand and congratulated him, but then tugged painfully at Wilson’s hair to verify its authenticity, explaining that previous applicants had tried to deceive him with wigs and paint. Satisfied, he announced loudly out the window that the position was filled, and the disappointed hopefuls dispersed, leaving only Wilson and the manager. The manager introduced himself as Mr. Duncan Ross and asked Wilson if he was married, explaining that the fund aimed to promote the red-haired line. On learning Wilson was a bachelor, Ross was momentarily disappointed, but eventually decided to make an exception due to Wilson’s impressive hair. When asked about the start date, Wilson expressed concern for his existing business, but his assistant assured him he could cover it. The hours for the new job, ten to two, suited Wilson fine, as his pawnbroking was mainly done in the evenings. The pay was £4 a week, and the only duty was to stay in the office during those hours, with forfeiture of the position for leaving early, regardless of reason. The actual work simply involved copying out the Encyclopedia Britannica; Wilson would need to provide his own writing materials, but otherwise, everything was ready.

          "text_segment": "He held up a piece of white cardboard about the size of a sheet of note-paper. It read in this fashion:\n“THE RED-HEADED LEAGUE IS DISSOLVED. October 9, 1890.”\nSherlock Holmes and I surveyed this curt announcement and the rueful face behind it, until the comical side of the affair so completely overtopped every other consideration that we both burst out into a roar of laughter.\n“I cannot see that there is anything very funny,” cried our client, flushing up to the roots of his flaming head. “If you can do nothing better than laugh at me, I can go elsewhere.”\n“No, no,” cried Holmes, shoving him back into the chair from which he had half risen. “I really wouldn’t miss your case for the world. It is most refreshingly unusual. But there is, if you will excuse my saying so, something just a little funny about it. Pray what steps did you take when you found the card upon the door?”\n“I was staggered, sir. I did not know what to do. Then I called at the offices round, but none of them seemed to know anything about it. Finally, I went to the landlord, who is an accountant living on the ground floor, and I asked him if he could tell me what had become of the Red-headed League. He said that he had never heard of any such body. Then I asked him who Mr. Duncan Ross was. He answered that the name was new to him.\n“‘Well,’ said I, ‘the gentleman at No. 4.’\n“‘What, the red-headed man?’\n“‘Yes.’\n“‘Oh,’ said he, ‘his name was William Morris. He was a solicitor and was using my room as a temporary convenience until his new premises were ready. He moved out yesterday.’\n“‘Where could I find him?’\n“‘Oh, at his new offices. He did tell me the address. Yes, 17 King Edward Street, near St. Paul’s.’\n“I started off, Mr. Holmes, but when I got to that address it was a manufactory of artificial knee-caps, and no one in it had ever heard of either Mr. William Morris or Mr. Duncan Ross.”\n“And what did you do then?” asked Holmes.\n“I went home to Saxe-Coburg Square, and I took the advice of my assistant. But he could not help me in any way. He could only say that if I waited I should hear by post. But that was not quite good enough, Mr. Holmes. I did not wish to lose such a place without a struggle, so, as I had heard that you were good enough to give advice to poor folk who were in need of it, I came right away to you.”\n“And you did very wisely,” said Holmes. “Your case is an exceedingly remarkable one, and I shall be happy to look into it. From what you have told me I think that it is possible that graver issues hang from it than might at first sight appear.”\n“Grave enough!” said Mr. Jabez Wilson. “Why, I have lost four pound a week.”\n“As far as you are personally concerned,” remarked Holmes, “I do not see that you have any grievance against this extraordinary league. On the contrary, you are, as I understand, richer by some £ 30, to say nothing of the minute knowledge which you have gained on every subject which comes under the letter A. You have lost nothing by them.”\n“No, sir. But I want to find out about them, and who they are, and what their object was in playing this prank—if it was a prank—upon me. It was a pretty expensive joke for them, for it cost them two and thirty pounds.”\n“We shall endeavour to clear up these points for you. And, first, one or two questions, Mr. Wilson. This assistant of yours who first called your attention to the advertisement—how long had he been with you?”\n“About a month then.”\n“How did he come?”\n“In answer to an advertisement.”\n“Was he the only applicant?”\n“No, I had a dozen.”\n“Why did you pick him?”\n“Because he was handy and would come cheap.”\n“At half wages, in fact.”\n“Yes.”\n“What is he like, this Vincent Spaulding?”\n“Small, stout-built, very quick in his ways, no hair on his face, though he’s not short of thirty. Has a white splash of acid upon his forehead.”\nHolmes sat up in his chair in considerable excitement. “I thought as much,” said he. “Have you ever observed that his ears are pierced for earrings?”\n“Yes, sir. He told me that a gipsy had done it for him when he was a lad.”\n“Hum!” said Holmes, sinking back in deep thought. “He is still with you?”\n“Oh, yes, sir; I have only just left him.”\n“And has your business been attended to in your absence?”\n“Nothing to complain of, sir. There’s never very much to do of a morning.”\n“That will do, Mr. Wilson. I shall be happy to give you an opinion upon the subject in the course of a day or two. To-day is Saturday, and I hope that by Monday we may come to a conclusion.”",

It contained the message: \"THE RED-HEADED LEAGUE IS DISSOLVED.

It is truly remarkably unusual. However, if you'll permit me to say so, there is something slightly funny about it. Please tell me, what did you do when you found that card on the door?\" \"I was stunned, sir. I didn't know what to do. Then I visited the nearby offices, but none of them knew anything about it. Eventually, I went to the landlord, who is an accountant living downstairs, and asked him if he could tell me what happened to the Red-headed League. He said he had never heard of such an organization. Then I asked him about a Mr. Duncan Ross. He replied that the name was unfamiliar to him. \"'Well,' I said, 'the gentleman in unit No. 4.' \"'Who, the man with the red hair?' \"'Yes.' \"'Oh,' he said, 'his name was William Morris.

On the contrary, as I understand it, you are richer by about £30, not to mention the detailed knowledge you've gained on every topic beginning with the letter A. You haven't lost anything because of them.\" \"No, sir. But I want to discover more about them, who they are, and what their purpose was in playing this trick—if it was a trick—on me. It was quite a costly joke for them, as it cost them thirty-two pounds.\" \"We will endeavor to clarify these points for you. And, first, a couple of questions, Mr. Wilson. This assistant of yours who first brought the advertisement to your attention—how long had he been working for you?\" \"About a month at that time.\" \"How did he come to be employed?\" \"In response to an advertisement.\" \"Was he the only applicant?\" \"No, I had twelve.\" \"Why did you select him?\" \"Because he was convenient and would work for low pay.\" \"At half the usual wages, in fact.\" \"Yes.\" \"Describe him, this Vincent Spaulding?\" \"Short, strongly built, very quick in his movements, no hair on his face, although he's close to thirty. He has a pale mark of acid on his forehead.\" Holmes straightened up in his chair with considerable interest. \"Just as I suspected,\" he said. \"Have you ever noticed that his ears are pierced for earrings?\" \"Yes, sir. He told me that a gypsy woman did it for him when he was a boy.\" \"Hmm,\" Holmes mused, leaning back deeply in thought. \"He is still working for you?\" \"Oh, yes, sir; I just left him.\" \"And has your business been managed properly in your absence?\" \"Nothing to complain about, sir. There's never very much work to do in the morning.\" \"That is sufficient, Mr. Wilson. I will be pleased to give you my opinion on the matter within a day or two.

From your account, there may be more significant matters at hand than we first recognize.’\n\n‘Serious enough for me!’ Mr. Jabez Wilson protested. ‘I’ve lost four pounds a week.’\n\n‘From what I can see,’ said Holmes, ‘you haven’t really been wronged by this unusual league. In fact, as I understand it, you are some £30 richer, not to mention the knowledge you gained on every “A” subject. You haven’t lost anything.’\n\n‘That’s true, sir. Still, I want to know who these people are and what their aim was in pulling off this—if it is a joke—at my expense. It certainly cost them more than thirty pounds.’\n\n‘We’ll do our best to clarify these matters for you. First, a few questions, Mr. Wilson. The assistant who told you about the advertisement—how long had he worked for you?’\n\n‘About a month at the time.’\n\n‘How did he join you?’\n\n‘I hired him in response to my own advertisement.’\n\n‘Was he the only applicant?’\n\n‘No, I had about a dozen.’\n\n‘Why did you select him?’\n\n‘He was competent and willing to work for low wages.’\n\n‘So, half pay, then.’\n\n‘Yes.’\n\n‘Can you describe Vincent Spaulding?’\n\n‘He's small, strongly built, very quick, beardless although about thirty, and he has a white acid stain on his forehead.’\n\nHolmes became visibly interested. ‘Just as I thought,’ he said. ‘Have you ever noticed if his ears are pierced for earrings?’\n\n‘Yes, sir.

          "text_segment": "“Well, Watson,” said Holmes when our visitor had left us, “what do you make of it all?”\n“I make nothing of it,” I answered frankly. “It is a most mysterious business.”\n“As a rule,” said Holmes, “the more bizarre a thing is the less mysterious it proves to be. It is your commonplace, featureless crimes which are really puzzling, just as a commonplace face is the most difficult to identify. But I must be prompt over this matter.”\n“What are you going to do, then?” I asked.\n“To smoke,” he answered. “It is quite a three pipe problem, and I beg that you won’t speak to me for fifty minutes.” He curled himself up in his chair, with his thin knees drawn up to his hawk-like nose, and there he sat with his eyes closed and his black clay pipe thrusting out like the bill of some strange bird. I had come to the conclusion that he had dropped asleep, and indeed was nodding myself, when he suddenly sprang out of his chair with the gesture of a man who has made up his mind and put his pipe down upon the mantelpiece.\n“Sarasate plays at the St. James’s Hall this afternoon,” he remarked. “What do you think, Watson? Could your patients spare you for a few hours?”\n“I have nothing to do to-day. My practice is never very absorbing.”\n“Then put on your hat and come. I am going through the City first, and we can have some lunch on the way. I observe that there is a good deal of German music on the programme, which is rather more to my taste than Italian or French. It is introspective, and I want to introspect. Come along!”\nWe travelled by the Underground as far as Aldersgate; and a short walk took us to Saxe-Coburg Square, the scene of the singular story which we had listened to in the morning. It was a poky, little, shabby-genteel place, where four lines of dingy two-storied brick houses looked out into a small railed-in enclosure, where a lawn of weedy grass and a few clumps of faded laurel bushes made a hard fight against a smoke-laden and uncongenial atmosphere. Three gilt balls and a brown board with “JABEZ WILSON” in white letters, upon a corner house, announced the place where our red-headed client carried on his business. Sherlock Holmes stopped in front of it with his head on one side and looked it all over, with his eyes shining brightly between puckered lids. Then he walked slowly up the street, and then down again to the corner, still looking keenly at the houses. Finally he returned to the pawnbroker’s, and, having thumped vigorously upon the pavement with his stick two or three times, he went up to the door and knocked. It was instantly opened by a bright-looking, clean-shaven young fellow, who asked him to step in.\n“Thank you,” said Holmes, “I only wished to ask you how you would go from here to the Strand.”\n“Third right, fourth left,” answered the assistant promptly, closing the door.\n“Smart fellow, that,” observed Holmes as we walked away. “He is, in my judgment, the fourth smartest man in London, and for daring I am not sure that he has not a claim to be third. I have known something of him before.”\n“Evidently,” said I, “Mr. Wilson’s assistant counts for a good deal in this mystery of the Red-headed League. I am sure that you inquired your way merely in order that you might see him.”\n“Not him.”\n“What then?”\n“The knees of his trousers.”\n“And what did you see?”\n“What I expected to see.”\n“Why did you beat the pavement?”\n“My dear doctor, this is a time for observation, not for talk. We are spies in an enemy’s country. We know something of Saxe-Coburg Square. Let us now explore the parts which lie behind it.”\nThe road in which we found ourselves as we turned round the corner from the retired Saxe-Coburg Square presented as great a contrast to it as the front of a picture does to the back. It was one of the main arteries which conveyed the traffic of the City to the north and west. The roadway was blocked with the immense stream of commerce flowing in a double tide inward and outward, while the footpaths were black with the hurrying swarm of pedestrians. It was difficult to realise as we looked at the line of fine shops and stately business premises that they really abutted on the other side upon the faded and stagnant square which we had just quitted.\n“Let me see,” said Holmes, standing at the corner and glancing along the line, “I should like just to remember the order of the houses here. It is a hobby of mine to have an exact knowledge of London. There is Mortimer’s, the tobacconist, the little newspaper shop, the Coburg branch of the City and Suburban Bank, the Vegetarian Restaurant, and McFarlane’s carriage-building depot. That carries us right on to the other block. And now, Doctor, we’ve done our work, so it’s time we had some play. A sandwich and a cup of coffee, and then off to violin-land, where all is sweetness and delicacy and harmony, and there are no red-headed clients to vex us with their conundrums.”",
          "paraphrase_gemini-2.5-flash-preview-04-17": "After our guest had departed, Holmes turned to me and asked, \"Well, Watson, what's your take on all this?\" I admitted frankly, \"I don't understand any of it. It's an extremely strange affair.\" Holmes commented, \"Generally speaking, the odder something appears, the less complex it turns out to be. It's the ordinary, unremarkable crimes that are truly difficult to figure out, much like an average face is hardest to identify. However, I need to address this matter quickly.\" I inquired, \"So, what's your next step?\" He replied, \"To smoke. This case requires considerable thought – a three-pipe problem, in fact – and I request you refrain from talking to me for the next fifty minutes.\" He settled deeply into his chair, pulling his thin knees up towards his sharp nose. There he remained, eyes shut, his dark clay pipe jutting out like a strange bird's beak. I began to think he had fallen asleep, and I myself was starting to drift off, when he suddenly leaped up from his chair with the decisive air of someone who has reached a conclusion, setting his pipe down on the mantelpiece. \"Sarasate is performing at the St. James's Hall this afternoon,\" he announced. \"What do you say, Watson? Can your patients manage without you for a few hours?\" \"I have no commitments today,\" I replied. \"My medical practice is never particularly demanding.\" \"Then grab your hat and join me,\" said Holmes. \"I'm going through the City first, and we can grab some lunch along the way. I see the program features a good amount of German music, which I prefer to Italian or French. It's contemplative, and I need to do some contemplating. Let's go!\" We took the Underground as far as Aldersgate, and a short walk brought us to Saxe-Coburg Square, the location central to the unusual account we'd heard that morning. It was a cramped, small, rather run-down but aspiring-to-respectability place, where four rows of grimy two-story brick houses bordered a small fenced area. This enclosure contained a patchy, weed-filled lawn and a few clusters of wilting laurel bushes struggling against the polluted, unwelcoming air. On a corner building, three gilded spheres and a brown sign displaying \"JABEZ WILSON\" in white letters marked the premises where our client with the red hair conducted his business. Sherlock Holmes paused in front of it, tilting his head and scanning the entire scene, his eyes gleaming brightly between narrowed lids. Then he walked slowly up the street, turned around, and came back down to the corner, still observing the houses intently. Finally, he returned to the pawnbroker's shop, struck the pavement forcefully with his stick two or three times, approached the door, and knocked. It was opened immediately by a bright, clean-shaven young man who invited him inside. \"Thank you,\" Holmes said, \"but I merely wanted to inquire about the best way to get from here to the Strand.\" \"Third right, fourth left,\" the assistant replied promptly, closing the door. \"Sharp fellow, that,\" Holmes commented as we moved away. \"In my estimation, he's the fourth most intelligent man in London, and I'm not certain he shouldn't be ranked third for his audacity. I've had some previous dealings with him.\" \"Clearly,\" I remarked, \"Mr. Wilson's assistant plays a significant role in this Red-headed League mystery. I'm certain you asked for directions only so you could see him.\" \"Not him.\" \"Then what?\" \"His trouser knees.\" \"And what did you observe?\" \"Precisely what I anticipated.\" \"Why did you hit the pavement?\" \"My dear doctor, this is a moment for observation, not discussion. We are like spies in hostile territory. We now understand something about Saxe-Coburg Square. Let's investigate the areas behind it.\" The street we entered after turning the corner from the secluded Saxe-Coburg Square presented a stark contrast, like the front of a painting compared to its back. It was a major thoroughfare carrying traffic from the City towards the north and west. The street was jammed with the enormous flow of commerce moving in both directions, while the sidewalks were packed with a bustling crowd of pedestrians. Looking at the line of impressive shops and grand business buildings, it was hard to believe they backed directly onto the faded and quiet square we had just left. \"Let me see,\" Holmes said, pausing at the corner and looking along the street. \"I want to make sure I remember the sequence of businesses here. Having precise knowledge of London is a personal interest of mine. There's Mortimer's, the tobacconist, the small newsagent's shop, the Coburg branch of the City and Suburban Bank, the Vegetarian Restaurant, and McFarlane's carriage works. That takes us right to the next block. And now, Doctor, we've finished our task here, so it's time for some recreation. A sandwich and some coffee, and then off to the world of violins, where everything is pleasant, refined, and harmonious, and there are no red-headed clients bothering us with their puzzles.\"",
          "paraphrase_gpt-4.1-2025-04-14": "After our visitor departed, Holmes turned to me and asked my thoughts on the situation. I admitted honestly that I was baffled, saying it was extremely mysterious. Holmes remarked that, in his experience, the more strange a case appears, the less mysterious it actually is; it’s often the ordinary, unremarkable crimes that create the most confusion, just as ordinary faces are hard to recognize. He mentioned he needed to act swiftly. When I inquired about his next step, Holmes replied that he intended to smoke, calling it a problem that would take three pipes to figure out and requested that I not disturb him for nearly an hour. Holmes settled into his chair, knees near his nose, eyes closed, and his pipe sticking out like a curious bird’s beak. Seeing him like that, I presumed he had dozed off, and I too began to nod. Suddenly, Holmes jumped up, decisively, and set his pipe on the mantelpiece, mentioning a performance by Sarasate at St. James’s Hall that afternoon. He asked if my patients could spare me for a few hours, to which I replied that my practice was seldom demanding. Holmes suggested we go out, passing through the City and grabbing lunch, noting his preference for the German music on the program as it was introspective, fitting his current mood. \n\nWe took the Underground to Aldersgate and soon arrived at Saxe-Coburg Square, where the unusual case we’d heard about that morning had unfolded. The square was small and rundown, surrounded by dreary two-story brick houses facing a fenced-in patch of weedy grass and faded laurels, all struggling against the harsh, sooty air. One corner house bore a brown sign with three golden balls and “JABEZ WILSON” in white letters, showing where our red-haired client worked. Holmes examined the house closely, his eyes bright and alert, before slowly walking up and down the street, studying the surroundings. He then returned to the pawnbroker shop, rapped his stick on the pavement, and knocked on the door, which was promptly opened by a cheerful, clean-shaven young man who politely directed Holmes to the Strand before closing the door.\n\nHolmes commented on the young man's cleverness, claiming he was one of the smartest men in London and possibly even bolder than others, suggesting he knew of him before. I noted that Mr. Wilson’s assistant seemed key to the Red-headed League mystery, believing Holmes’s inquiry was just an excuse to see him, but Holmes clarified it was the man’s trouser knees he wanted to observe, which revealed exactly what he expected. When I asked about his reason for tapping the pavement, Holmes reminded me that now was a time for observation, likening us to spies, and suggested we explore the area behind the square.\n\nThe street behind Saxe-Coburg Square stood in stark contrast, being a busy thoroughfare packed with people and commerce, lined with fine shops and stately businesses, difficult to believe it shared a border with the rundown square we’d just seen. Holmes paused to memorize the order of the businesses—Mortimer’s tobacconist, a newspaper shop, a City and Suburban Bank branch, a vegetarian restaurant, and a carriage depot—remarking on his passion for knowing London in detail. He then declared our work concluded for the moment and suggested enjoying a sandwich and coffee before immersing ourselves in music, free from troublesome clients and their riddles."

          "text_segment": "My friend was an enthusiastic musician, being himself not only a very capable performer but a composer of no ordinary merit. All the afternoon he sat in the stalls wrapped in the most perfect happiness, gently waving his long, thin fingers in time to the music, while his gently smiling face and his languid, dreamy eyes were as unlike those of Holmes the sleuth-hound, Holmes the relentless, keen-witted, ready-handed criminal agent, as it was possible to conceive. In his singular character the dual nature alternately asserted itself, and his extreme exactness and astuteness represented, as I have often thought, the reaction against the poetic and contemplative mood which occasionally predominated in him. The swing of his nature took him from extreme languor to devouring energy; and, as I knew well, he was never so truly formidable as when, for days on end, he had been lounging in his armchair amid his improvisations and his black-letter editions. Then it was that the lust of the chase would suddenly come upon him, and that his brilliant reasoning power would rise to the level of intuition, until those who were unacquainted with his methods would look askance at him as on a man whose knowledge was not that of other mortals. When I saw him that afternoon so enwrapped in the music at St. James’s Hall I felt that an evil time might be coming upon those whom he had set himself to hunt down.\n“You want to go home, no doubt, Doctor,” he remarked as we emerged.\n“Yes, it would be as well.”\n“And I have some business to do which will take some hours. This business at Coburg Square is serious.”\n“Why serious?”\n“A considerable crime is in contemplation. I have every reason to believe that we shall be in time to stop it. But to-day being Saturday rather complicates matters. I shall want your help to-night.”\n“At what time?”\n“Ten will be early enough.”\n“I shall be at Baker Street at ten.”\n“Very well. And, I say, Doctor, there may be some little danger, so kindly put your army revolver in your pocket.” He waved his hand, turned on his heel, and disappeared in an instant among the crowd.\nI trust that I am not more dense than my neighbours, but I was always oppressed with a sense of my own stupidity in my dealings with Sherlock Holmes. Here I had heard what he had heard, I had seen what he had seen, and yet from his words it was evident that he saw clearly not only what had happened but what was about to happen, while to me the whole business was still confused and grotesque. As I drove home to my house in Kensington I thought over it all, from the extraordinary story of the red-headed copier of the Encyclopædia down to the visit to Saxe-Coburg Square, and the ominous words with which he had parted from me. What was this nocturnal expedition, and why should I go armed? Where were we going, and what were we to do? I had the hint from Holmes that this smooth-faced pawnbroker’s assistant was a formidable man—a man who might play a deep game. I tried to puzzle it out, but gave it up in despair and set the matter aside until night should bring an explanation.\nIt was a quarter-past nine when I started from home and made my way across the Park, and so through Oxford Street to Baker Street. Two hansoms were standing at the door, and as I entered the passage I heard the sound of voices from above. On entering his room, I found Holmes in animated conversation with two men, one of whom I recognised as Peter Jones, the official police agent, while the other was a long, thin, sad-faced man, with a very shiny hat and oppressively respectable frock-coat.\n“Ha! Our party is complete,” said Holmes, buttoning up his pea-jacket and taking his heavy hunting crop from the rack. “Watson, I think you know Mr. Jones, of Scotland Yard? Let me introduce you to Mr. Merryweather, who is to be our companion in to-night’s adventure.”\n“We’re hunting in couples again, Doctor, you see,” said Jones in his consequential way. “Our friend here is a wonderful man for starting a chase. All he wants is an old dog to help him to do the running down.”\n“I hope a wild goose may not prove to be the end of our chase,” observed Mr. Merryweather gloomily.\n“You may place considerable confidence in Mr. Holmes, sir,” said the police agent loftily. “He has his own little methods, which are, if he won’t mind my saying so, just a little too theoretical and fantastic, but he has the makings of a detective in him. It is not too much to say that once or twice, as in that business of the Sholto murder and the Agra treasure, he has been more nearly correct than the official force.”\n“Oh, if you say so, Mr. Jones, it is all right,” said the stranger with deference. “Still, I confess that I miss my rubber. It is the first Saturday night for seven-and-twenty years that I have not had my rubber.”\n“I think you will find,” said Sherlock Holmes, “that you will play for a higher stake to-night than you have ever done yet, and that the play will be more exciting. For you, Mr. Merryweather, the stake will be some £ 30,000; and for you, Jones, it will be the man upon whom you wish to lay your hands.”\n“John Clay, the murderer, thief, smasher, and forger. He’s a young man, Mr. Merryweather, but he is at the head of his profession, and I would rather have my bracelets on him than on any criminal in London. He’s a remarkable man, is young John Clay. His grandfather was a royal duke, and he himself has been to Eton and Oxford. His brain is as cunning as his fingers, and though we meet signs of him at every turn, we never know where to find the man himself. He’ll crack a crib in Scotland one week, and be raising money to build an orphanage in Cornwall the next. I’ve been on his track for years and have never set eyes on him yet.”\n“I hope that I may have the pleasure of introducing you to-night. I’ve had one or two little turns also with Mr. John Clay, and I agree with you that he is at the head of his profession. It is past ten, however, and quite time that we started. If you two will take the first hansom, Watson and I will follow in the second.”\nSherlock Holmes was not very communicative during the long drive and lay back in the cab humming the tunes which he had heard in the afternoon. We rattled through an endless labyrinth of gas-lit streets until we emerged into Farrington Street.\n“We are close there now,” my friend remarked. “This fellow Merryweather is a bank director, and personally interested in the matter. I thought it as well to have Jones with us also. He is not a bad fellow, though an absolute imbecile in his profession. He has one positive virtue. He is as brave as a bulldog and as tenacious as a lobster if he gets his claws upon anyone. Here we are, and they are waiting for us.”\nWe had reached the same crowded thoroughfare in which we had found ourselves in the morning. Our cabs were dismissed, and, following the guidance of Mr. Merryweather, we passed down a narrow passage and through a side door, which he opened for us. Within there was a small corridor, which ended in a very massive iron gate. This also was opened, and led down a flight of winding stone steps, which terminated at another formidable gate. Mr. Merryweather stopped to light a lantern, and then conducted us down a dark, earth-smelling passage, and so, after opening a third door, into a huge vault or cellar, which was piled all round with crates and massive boxes.\n“You are not very vulnerable from above,” Holmes remarked as he held up the lantern and gazed about him.\n“Nor from below,” said Mr. Merryweather, striking his stick upon the flags which lined the floor. “Why, dear me, it sounds quite hollow!” he remarked, looking up in surprise.\n“I must really ask you to be a little more quiet!” said Holmes severely. “You have already imperilled the whole success of our expedition. Might I beg that you would have the goodness to sit down upon one of those boxes, and not to interfere?”\nThe solemn Mr. Merryweather perched himself upon a crate, with a very injured expression upon his face, while Holmes fell upon his knees upon the floor and, with the lantern and a magnifying lens, began to examine minutely the cracks between the stones. A few seconds sufficed to satisfy him, for he sprang to his feet again and put his glass in his pocket.\n“We have at least an hour before us,” he remarked, “for they can hardly take any steps until the good pawnbroker is safely in bed. Then they will not lose a minute, for the sooner they do their work the longer time they will have for their escape. We are at present, Doctor—as no doubt you have divined—in the cellar of the City branch of one of the principal London banks. Mr. Merryweather is the chairman of directors, and he will explain to you that there are reasons why the more daring criminals of London should take a considerable interest in this cellar at present.”\n“It is our French gold,” whispered the director. “We have had several warnings that an attempt might be made upon it.”\n“Your French gold?”\n“Yes. We had occasion some months ago to strengthen our resources and borrowed for that purpose 30,000 napoleons from the Bank of France. It has become known that we have never had occasion to unpack the money, and that it is still lying in our cellar. The crate upon which I sit contains 2,000 napoleons packed between layers of lead foil. Our reserve of bullion is much larger at present than is usually kept in a single branch office, and the directors have had misgivings upon the subject.”\n“Which were very well justified,” observed Holmes. “And now it is time that we arranged our little plans. I expect that within an hour matters will come to a head. In the meantime Mr. Merryweather, we must put the screen over that dark lantern.”\n“And sit in the dark?”\n“I am afraid so. I had brought a pack of cards in my pocket, and I thought that, as we were a partie carrée, you might have your rubber after all. But I see that the enemy’s preparations have gone so far that we cannot risk the presence of a light. And, first of all, we must choose our positions. These are daring men, and though we shall take them at a disadvantage, they may do us some harm unless we are careful. I shall stand behind this crate, and do you conceal yourselves behind those. Then, when I flash a light upon them, close in swiftly. If they fire, Watson, have no compunction about shooting them down.”\nI placed my revolver, cocked, upon the top of the wooden case behind which I crouched. Holmes shot the slide across the front of his lantern and left us in pitch darkness—such an absolute darkness as I have never before experienced. The smell of hot metal remained to assure us that the light was still there, ready to flash out at a moment’s notice. To me, with my nerves worked up to a pitch of expectancy, there was something depressing and subduing in the sudden gloom, and in the cold dank air of the vault.\n“They have but one retreat,” whispered Holmes. “That is back through the house into Saxe-Coburg Square. I hope that you have done what I asked you, Jones?”\n“I have an inspector and two officers waiting at the front door.”\n“Then we have stopped all the holes. And now we must be silent and wait.”",
          "paraphrase_gemini-2.5-flash-preview-04-17": "My friend was a passionate musician, not only skilled at performing but also a remarkably talented composer. That entire afternoon, he sat completely absorbed in the concert, his long, slender fingers softly moving in rhythm with the music. His gentle smile and distant, dreamy gaze were entirely unlike the image of Holmes the relentless investigator, the sharp-witted, quick-acting agent who pursued criminals. His unique personality contained this alternating duality; his meticulous precision and intelligence were, as I often believed, a counterpoint to the poetic and meditative state that sometimes took hold of him. His disposition swung from profound inactivity to intense energy. As I knew well, he was never more formidable than after spending days lounging in his armchair, absorbed in his musical improvisations and old books. It was then that the thrill of the hunt would suddenly seize him, and his brilliant deductive abilities would seem almost intuitive. Those unfamiliar with his methods would regard him with suspicion, as if his knowledge came from somewhere beyond ordinary mortals. Seeing him so engrossed in the music at St. James’s Hall that afternoon, I sensed that difficult times might be ahead for those he intended to pursue.\n\n“You wish to return home, I presume, Doctor,” he commented as we exited.\n\n“Yes, that would be wise.”\n\n“And I have some necessary business that will require a few hours. This matter at Coburg Square is serious.”\n\n“Why is it serious?”\n\n“A significant crime is being planned. I have strong reasons to believe we will be able to prevent it. However, the fact that today is Saturday makes things somewhat more complicated. I will need your assistance tonight.”\n\n“At what time?”\n\n“Ten o’clock will be soon enough.”\n\n“I will be at Baker Street by ten.”\n\n“Excellent. And, let me add, Doctor, there might be some minor danger, so please bring your army revolver.” He gestured, turned sharply, and vanished into the throng instantly.\n\nI hope I am not less intelligent than others, but I always felt inadequate in my interactions with Sherlock Holmes. Here I had heard the same things he had heard and seen the same things he had seen, yet from his words, it was clear that he understood not only what had occurred but also what was imminent, while to me, the entire situation remained puzzling and bizarre. As I drove back to my house in Kensington, I pondered everything, from the extraordinary account of the red-headed man copying the Encyclopaedia to the visit to Saxe-Coburg Square, and the ominous words he had spoken upon leaving. What was this planned nocturnal activity, and why should I be armed? Where were we going, and what task awaited us? Holmes had suggested that the smooth-faced pawnbroker’s assistant was a dangerous individual – someone capable of playing a complex game. I tried to unravel the mystery but eventually gave up in frustration, deciding to wait until the night brought clarity.\n\nIt was a quarter past nine when I left my home and made my way through the Park, and then via Oxford Street to Baker Street. Two horse-drawn cabs were waiting at the door, and as I entered the hallway, I heard voices from the room above. Upon entering his room, I found Holmes engaged in a lively discussion with two men. One I recognized as Peter Jones, the official police detective. The other was a tall, thin man with a somber expression, wearing a very shiny hat and a rather overly respectable frock-coat.\n\n“Ah! Our group is complete,” Holmes declared, buttoning up his short jacket and taking his heavy riding crop from the hook. “Watson, I believe you are acquainted with Mr. Jones from Scotland Yard? Allow me to introduce you to Mr. Merryweather, who will join us in tonight’s venture.”\n\n“We’re partnering up again, Doctor, you see,” said Jones in his usual pompous manner. “Our friend here is excellent at initiating a search. All he needs is an experienced hand to help him complete it.”\n\n“I hope our search doesn’t turn out to be pointless,” Mr. Merryweather remarked gloomily.\n\n“You can have considerable confidence in Mr. Holmes, sir,” the police detective stated patronizingly. “He has his own peculiar methods, which, if he’ll pardon my saying so, are a little too abstract and eccentric, but he does have potential as a detective. It’s fair to say that on occasion, such as the Sholto murder case and the Agra treasure, he has been more accurate than the official police force.”\n\n“Oh, if you say so, Mr. Jones, then it must be all right,” the stranger replied deferentially. “Still, I must admit I’ll miss my card game. It’s the first Saturday night in twenty-seven years I haven’t played cards.”\n\n“I believe you will discover,” said Sherlock Holmes, “that you will be playing for higher stakes tonight than ever before, and the game will be far more thrilling. For you, Mr. Merryweather, the stake will be approximately £30,000; and for you, Jones, it will be the man you are eager to apprehend.”\n\n“John Clay, the murderer, thief, counterfeiter, and forger. He’s young, Mr. Merryweather, but he is the most skilled criminal in his field, and I would rather arrest him than any other criminal in London. He is a remarkable individual, this young John Clay. His grandfather was a royal duke, and he attended both Eton and Oxford. His mind is as clever as his hands are nimble, and though we encounter evidence of his work everywhere, we can never locate the man himself. One week he’ll rob a house in Scotland, and the next he’ll be raising money to construct an orphanage in Cornwall. I’ve been pursuing him for years and have never once seen him.”\n\n“I hope I can provide you with the pleasure of meeting him tonight. I have also had a few encounters with Mr. John Clay and agree that he is preeminent in his line of work. However, it is now past ten, and high time we departed. If you two will take the first cab, Watson and I will follow in the second.”\n\nSherlock Holmes said very little during the long journey, leaning back in the cab and softly humming the melodies he had heard that afternoon. We rattled through an endless maze of gas-lit streets until we emerged onto Farrington Street.\n\n“We are close now,” my friend observed. “This gentleman, Merryweather, is a bank director with a personal interest in the matter. I felt it was also necessary to have Jones with us. He isn’t a bad fellow, although completely incompetent in his profession. He does possess one valuable quality: he is as fearless as a bulldog and as persistent as a lobster once he seizes hold of someone. Here we are, and they are waiting for us.”\n\nWe had arrived at the same bustling street we had visited earlier that morning. Our cabs were dismissed, and, guided by Mr. Merryweather, we proceeded down a narrow passage and through a side door, which he unlocked for us. Inside was a small corridor ending at a very solid iron gate. This was also opened, leading down a winding stone staircase that concluded at another imposing gate. Mr. Merryweather paused to light a lantern, then led us down a dark passage smelling of earth, and finally, after opening a third door, into a vast vault or cellar, which was lined all around with stacks of crates and large boxes.\n\n“You are well protected from above,” Holmes commented as he raised the lantern and looked around.\n\n“And from below,” Mr. Merryweather added, striking his stick upon the stone slabs covering the floor. “Why, dear me, it sounds quite hollow!” he exclaimed, looking up in surprise.\n\n“I really must insist you be a little quieter!” Holmes said sternly. “You have already risked jeopardizing our entire operation. May I please ask you to do me the favor of sitting down on one of those boxes and refraining from interfering?”\n\nThe solemn Mr. Merryweather seated himself on a crate, looking quite offended, while Holmes knelt on the floor and, using the lantern and a magnifying glass, began meticulously examining the gaps between the stones. A few moments were sufficient for him; he quickly stood up and put his lens back in his pocket.\n\n“We have at least an hour ahead of us,” he remarked, “since they are unlikely to make a move until the pawnbroker is safely asleep in bed. Then they won’t waste a moment, for the sooner they finish their task, the more time they will have to escape. We are currently, Doctor—as you have undoubtedly deduced—in the cellar of the City branch of one of London’s major banks. Mr. Merryweather is the chairman of the board, and he will explain that there are reasons why London’s more audacious criminals are taking a significant interest in this cellar right now.”\n\n“It is our French gold,” the director whispered. “We have received several warnings that an attempt might be made on it.”\n\n“Your French gold?”\n\n“Yes. Some months ago, we needed to strengthen our reserves and borrowed 30,000 napoleons from the Bank of France for that purpose. Word has gotten out that we never needed to unpack the money and that it is still stored in our cellar. The crate I am sitting on contains 2,000 napoleons packaged between layers of lead foil. Our current gold reserve is much larger than what is typically kept in a single branch office, and the directors have been concerned about it.”\n\n“Which concerns were entirely justified,” Holmes observed. “And now it is time we arranged our immediate strategy. I anticipate that matters will come to a head within an hour. In the meantime, Mr. Merryweather, we must place the screen over that dark lantern.”\n\n“And sit in the dark?”\n\n“I am afraid so. I had brought a deck of cards in my pocket, thinking that, since we were a party of four, you might get your card game after all. But I see that the enemy’s preparations are too advanced for us to risk having a light. And, first things first, we must select our positions. These are dangerous men, and although we will catch them by surprise, they could harm us if we are not careful. I will stand behind this crate, and you two should conceal yourselves behind those ones. Then, when I shine a light on them, move in quickly. If they fire, Watson, do not hesitate to shoot them down.”\n\nI placed my revolver, cocked and ready, on top of the wooden box behind which I crouched. Holmes slid the cover across the front of his lantern, leaving us in complete darkness—a total blackness I had never before experienced. The scent of warm metal remained, assuring us that the light was still there, ready to flash on instantly. For me, with my nerves heightened by anticipation, there was something oppressive and sobering about the sudden darkness and the cold, damp air of the vault.\n\n“They have only one way out,” Holmes whispered. “That is back through the building into Saxe-Coburg Square. I hope you have done as I requested, Jones?”\n\n“I have an inspector and two officers waiting at the main entrance.”\n\n“Then we have all escape routes blocked. And now, we must be silent and wait.”",
          "paraphrase_gpt-4.1-2025-04-14": "My companion was very passionate about music; not only could he perform skillfully, but he also composed pieces of notable quality. He spent the whole afternoon sitting among the audience, completely content, moving his long fingers in time with the melodies, his face serene and his eyes dreamy—appearing entirely different from the sharp, determined detective persona he was known for. Holmes’s unique character oscillated between extreme precision and keen intellect, which I believed was a counterbalance to his occasional poetic, reflective tendencies. His temperament swung from deep relaxation to intense drive. I knew, from experience, that Holmes was most formidable after days of apparent idleness, lost in music or his rare books—then some thrill of the hunt would ignite in him and his reasoning abilities would almost seem like intuition, causing even those unfamiliar with him to be suspicious of his seemingly preternatural knowledge. Observing him so absorbed in the music at St. James’s Hall that afternoon, I sensed that whoever he was pursuing next would soon be in trouble.\n\nUpon leaving, Holmes said to me, \"You probably want to head home, Doctor.\" I agreed. Holmes then told me he had business that would take several hours and that the situation at Coburg Square was very serious—he suspected a major crime was about to take place, but believed we could prevent it, though the fact that it was Saturday complicated matters. He told me he would need my help at ten that night. As we parted, he added that there might be danger, and advised me to bring my revolver.\n\nI have never considered myself more obtuse than others, but dealing with Holmes always left me feeling dull. Although we shared the same experiences, he seemed able to deduce both past and future events with clarity, while I was left confused. On my way home, I pondered the entire affair, starting from the odd story of the red-haired man copying the encyclopaedia to our visit to Saxe-Coburg Square, and Holmes’s ominous farewell. I gave up trying to solve the mystery until nightfall, which would hopefully bring explanations.\n\nAt quarter past nine I left home, made my way through the park, Oxford Street, and finally to Baker Street. Two cabs stood by the door, and I heard voices upstairs. When I entered, Holmes was talking animatedly with two men—one I recognized as Peter Jones from the police, and the other was a tall, thin, sad-faced man dressed in an extremely respectable manner.\n\n\"The group's all here,\" Holmes said, putting on his coat and picking up his hunting crop. \"Watson, you know Mr. Jones from Scotland Yard. Allow me to introduce Mr. Merryweather, who will join our adventure tonight.\"\n\n\"We're pairing up again, Doctor,\" Jones proclaimed proudly. \"Mr. Holmes is great at starting a hunt—all he needs is an old dog to track it down.\"\n\nMr. Merryweather grumbled about missing his regular Saturday night card game, but Holmes assured him that tonight’s \"game\" had stakes much higher—thirty thousand pounds for Merryweather, and the criminal capture for Jones.\n\nJones explained they were after John Clay—a young but highly accomplished criminal with aristocratic connections and a cunning mind, known for his crimes yet always eluding the police.\n\nHolmes disclosed he’d also encountered Clay before and agreed with Jones’s assessment. As time was short, Holmes suggested they depart, with Jones and Merryweather in the first cab, and Watson and Holmes following in the second.\n\nDuring the ride, Holmes was little inclined to talk, humming tunes from the afternoon performance as we travelled through the busy, gas-lit streets, eventually arriving at Farrington Street.\n\n\"We're nearly there,\" Holmes said. He explained that Merryweather was a bank director and thus personally involved, and that Jones was brave if not very bright. Upon arrival, we followed Merryweather through a narrow passage and several secure doors down into a large cellar filled with crates and boxes.\n\nHolmes commented that the vault was well-protected from above and below, but upon hearing Merryweather strike the floor, he noted it sounded hollow. Holmes cautioned Merryweather not to jeopardize their mission with noise and asked him to sit quietly. Holmes then examined the floor with a lantern and magnifying glass, quickly satisfying himself before explaining that they had at least an hour before anything would happen, and revealing that they were in the cellar of a major London bank. Merryweather clarified it was because of a large store of borrowed French gold—thirty thousand napoleons—kept in the vault, which had attracted more criminal interest than usual.\n\nHolmes agreed, and suggested they prepare: they needed to cover the lantern and sit in the dark, as their adversaries were bold and could be dangerous if not swiftly apprehended. Holmes organized their positions—he would hide behind a crate, and instructed the others to conceal themselves as well, ready to spring when he signaled with the light, and advised Watson not to hesitate to shoot if necessary.\n\nI readied my revolver and crouched behind a crate, while Holmes covered the lantern, plunging us into complete darkness. The intense blackness and the cold, damp air heightened my anxiety. Holmes whispered that the only exit was back into Saxe-Coburg Square, and confirmed with Jones that he had men stationed at the front. Satisfied that no one could escape, Holmes said it was time to wait in silence."

          "text_segment": "What a time it seemed! From comparing notes afterwards it was but an hour and a quarter, yet it appeared to me that the night must have almost gone, and the dawn be breaking above us. My limbs were weary and stiff, for I feared to change my position; yet my nerves were worked up to the highest pitch of tension, and my hearing was so acute that I could not only hear the gentle breathing of my companions, but I could distinguish the deeper, heavier in-breath of the bulky Jones from the thin, sighing note of the bank director. From my position I could look over the case in the direction of the floor. Suddenly my eyes caught the glint of a light.\nAt first it was but a lurid spark upon the stone pavement. Then it lengthened out until it became a yellow line, and then, without any warning or sound, a gash seemed to open and a hand appeared, a white, almost womanly hand, which felt about in the centre of the little area of light. For a minute or more the hand, with its writhing fingers, protruded out of the floor. Then it was withdrawn as suddenly as it appeared, and all was dark again save the single lurid spark which marked a chink between the stones.\nIts disappearance, however, was but momentary. With a rending, tearing sound, one of the broad, white stones turned over upon its side and left a square, gaping hole, through which streamed the light of a lantern. Over the edge there peeped a clean-cut, boyish face, which looked keenly about it, and then, with a hand on either side of the aperture, drew itself shoulder-high and waist-high, until one knee rested upon the edge. In another instant he stood at the side of the hole and was hauling after him a companion, lithe and small like himself, with a pale face and a shock of very red hair.\n“It’s all clear,” he whispered. “Have you the chisel and the bags? Great Scott! Jump, Archie, jump, and I’ll swing for it!”\nSherlock Holmes had sprung out and seized the intruder by the collar. The other dived down the hole, and I heard the sound of rending cloth as Jones clutched at his skirts. The light flashed upon the barrel of a revolver, but Holmes’ hunting crop came down on the man’s wrist, and the pistol clinked upon the stone floor.\n“It’s no use, John Clay,” said Holmes blandly. “You have no chance at all.”\n“So I see,” the other answered with the utmost coolness. “I fancy that my pal is all right, though I see you have got his coat-tails.”\n“There are three men waiting for him at the door,” said Holmes.\n“Oh, indeed! You seem to have done the thing very completely. I must compliment you.”\n“And I you,” Holmes answered. “Your red-headed idea was very new and effective.”\n“You’ll see your pal again presently,” said Jones. “He’s quicker at climbing down holes than I am. Just hold out while I fix the derbies.”\n“I beg that you will not touch me with your filthy hands,” remarked our prisoner as the handcuffs clattered upon his wrists. “You may not be aware that I have royal blood in my veins. Have the goodness, also, when you address me always to say ‘sir’ and ‘please.’”\n“All right,” said Jones with a stare and a snigger. “Well, would you please, sir, march upstairs, where we can get a cab to carry your Highness to the police-station?”\n“That is better,” said John Clay serenely. He made a sweeping bow to the three of us and walked quietly off in the custody of the detective.\n“Really, Mr. Holmes,” said Mr. Merryweather as we followed them from the cellar, “I do not know how the bank can thank you or repay you. There is no doubt that you have detected and defeated in the most complete manner one of the most determined attempts at bank robbery that have ever come within my experience.”\n“I have had one or two little scores of my own to settle with Mr. John Clay,” said Holmes. “I have been at some small expense over this matter, which I shall expect the bank to refund, but beyond that I am amply repaid by having had an experience which is in many ways unique, and by hearing the very remarkable narrative of the Red-headed League.”\n“You see, Watson,” he explained in the early hours of the morning as we sat over a glass of whisky and soda in Baker Street, “it was perfectly obvious from the first that the only possible object of this rather fantastic business of the advertisement of the League, and the copying of the Encyclopædia, must be to get this not over-bright pawnbroker out of the way for a number of hours every day. It was a curious way of managing it, but, really, it would be difficult to suggest a better. The method was no doubt suggested to Clay’s ingenious mind by the colour of his accomplice’s hair. The £ 4 a week was a lure which must draw him, and what was it to them, who were playing for thousands? They put in the advertisement, one rogue has the temporary office, the other rogue incites the man to apply for it, and together they manage to secure his absence every morning in the week. From the time that I heard of the assistant having come for half wages, it was obvious to me that he had some strong motive for securing the situation.”\n“But how could you guess what the motive was?”\n“Had there been women in the house, I should have suspected a mere vulgar intrigue. That, however, was out of the question. The man’s business was a small one, and there was nothing in his house which could account for such elaborate preparations, and such an expenditure as they were at. It must, then, be something out of the house. What could it be? I thought of the assistant’s fondness for photography, and his trick of vanishing into the cellar. The cellar! There was the end of this tangled clue. Then I made inquiries as to this mysterious assistant and found that I had to deal with one of the coolest and most daring criminals in London. He was doing something in the cellar—something which took many hours a day for months on end. What could it be, once more? I could think of nothing save that he was running a tunnel to some other building.\n“So far I had got when we went to visit the scene of action. I surprised you by beating upon the pavement with my stick. I was ascertaining whether the cellar stretched out in front or behind. It was not in front. Then I rang the bell, and, as I hoped, the assistant answered it. We have had some skirmishes, but we had never set eyes upon each other before. I hardly looked at his face. His knees were what I wished to see. You must yourself have remarked how worn, wrinkled, and stained they were. They spoke of those hours of burrowing. The only remaining point was what they were burrowing for. I walked round the corner, saw the City and Suburban Bank abutted on our friend’s premises, and felt that I had solved my problem. When you drove home after the concert I called upon Scotland Yard and upon the chairman of the bank directors, with the result that you have seen.”\n“And how could you tell that they would make their attempt to-night?” I asked.\n“Well, when they closed their League offices that was a sign that they cared no longer about Mr. Jabez Wilson’s presence—in other words, that they had completed their tunnel. But it was essential that they should use it soon, as it might be discovered, or the bullion might be removed. Saturday would suit them better than any other day, as it would give them two days for their escape. For all these reasons I expected them to come to-night.”\n“You reasoned it out beautifully,” I exclaimed in unfeigned admiration. “It is so long a chain, and yet every link rings true.”\n“It saved me from ennui,” he answered, yawning. “Alas! I already feel it closing in upon me. My life is spent in one long effort to escape from the commonplaces of existence. These little problems help me to do so.”\n“And you are a benefactor of the race,” said I.\nHe shrugged his shoulders. “Well, perhaps, after all, it is of some little use,” he remarked. “‘L’homme c’est rien—l’œuvre c’est tout,’ as Gustave Flaubert wrote to George Sand.”",
          "paraphrase_gemini-2.5-flash-preview-04-17": "The time felt incredibly drawn out! Although we later calculated it was only an hour and fifteen minutes, it seemed to me as if the night was almost gone and dawn was about to break. My limbs were tired and rigid from being afraid to shift position, yet my nerves were completely on edge, and my hearing was so sharp that I could not only perceive the soft breathing of those with me but could also tell apart the deeper, stronger inhalations of the burly Jones from the slight, sighing breaths of the bank director. From where I was situated, I could look past the case towards the floor. Unexpectedly, my eyes caught sight of a faint light.",
          "paraphrase_gpt-4.1-2025-04-14": "Time seemed to drag on endlessly, though we later realized only about an hour and fifteen minutes had gone by; it felt to me as if the entire night had nearly passed and dawn was approaching. My body grew tired and stiff because I dared not move, but my nerves were wound tight, and my hearing became so sharp that I could distinguish not just my companions' breathing but tell apart the heavy breaths of Jones from the softer sighs of the bank director. From my spot I could see over the case toward the floor. Suddenly, I caught a glimmer of light. At first it was just a dim spark on the stone, then it brightened into a yellow line, and without warning, a crack opened and a pale, almost delicate hand reached out, searching in the light. The hand, with twisting fingers, appeared for a minute and then vanished, leaving only a faint spark marking a gap between the stones.\n\nThis disappearance was brief. With a loud, tearing noise, one of the large white stones slid aside, leaving a hole from which lantern light shone. A youthful, sharply-featured face appeared, scanning the room, then the person pulled himself up and rested a knee on the edge, quickly followed by a lithe, small companion with a pale face and bright red hair. \"All clear,\" he whispered. \"Got the chisel and bags? Hurry, Archie!\" \n\nAt that moment, Holmes leapt out and grabbed the intruder by the collar. The other man escaped back down the hole, with Jones grabbing at him. A revolver flashed in the light, but Holmes struck the man’s wrist, causing the gun to drop. \n\n\"It’s no use, John Clay,\" Holmes said calmly. \"You have no chance.\"\n\n\"So I see,\" replied Clay coolly. \"I suppose my friend is safe, though you have his coat-tails.\"\n\n\"There are three men waiting for him at the door,\" said Holmes.\n\n\"You’ve done this very thoroughly. My compliments,\" said Clay.\n\n\"And to you,\" replied Holmes. \"Your ingenious Red-Headed League plan was very clever.\"\n\n\"You’ll see your partner again soon,\" Jones added. \"He’s quicker at escaping than I am. Hold steady while I put the handcuffs on.\"\n\n\"Please don’t touch me with your dirty hands,\" said our captive as the handcuffs snapped shut. \"You may not know, but I have royal blood. Address me as ‘sir’ and ‘please.’\"\n\n\"All right, would you please, sir, come upstairs so we can take you to the station?\" Jones replied with a grin.\n\n\"Much better,\" Clay said serenely, bowing to us before quietly walking off with the detective.\n\n\"Really, Mr. Holmes,\" said Mr. Merryweather as we left the cellar, \"the bank owes you a great debt for foiling one of the boldest bank robbery attempts I’ve known.\"\n\n\"I had some matters to settle with Mr. John Clay myself,\" Holmes replied. \"I’ve incurred some expenses I hope the bank will cover, but otherwise, I was richly rewarded with the experience and by solving the Red-Headed League mystery.\"\n\nLater, as Holmes and I sat in Baker Street drinking whisky and soda, he explained: \"From the start, it was clear the League and the copying job were a ruse to keep the pawnbroker away from his shop for several hours every day. It was clever, likely inspired by the assistant's red hair. The wage was only a bait; they stood to gain thousands. One man published the ad, the other encouraged the pawnbroker to take the job, ensuring his absence every morning. Once I learned the assistant agreed to half wages, it was clear he had a strong ulterior motive.\"\n\nI asked, \"How did you know what that motive was?\"\n\n\"Had there been women in the house, I might have suspected a love affair, but that was not possible. The business was small, the house held nothing to justify such elaborate planning and spending. It must have been something outside the house. I thought of the assistant’s passion for photography and his habit of disappearing into the cellar. The cellar was the clue. My inquiries revealed the assistant was a notorious criminal, spending long hours below ground. What was he doing? The only explanation was tunneling to another building.\n\n\"When we visited, I tapped on the pavement to see if the cellar extended to the front or back—it was not in front. I rang the bell, and as I hoped, the assistant answered. I barely looked at his face, but I noticed how worn and dirty his knees were—clear evidence of tunneling. The only question left was their goal. I saw that the bank was next door and realized their purpose.\n\n\"When you left after the concert, I alerted Scotland Yard and the bank chairman.\"\n\nI asked, \"How did you know they would make their move tonight?\"\n\n\"When the League disbanded, it meant they didn’t care about Jabez Wilson’s presence anymore—the tunnel was ready. They needed to act soon before it was discovered or the gold moved. Saturday was ideal, giving them two days to escape. For all those reasons, I expected them tonight.\"\n\n\"Your reasoning was brilliant,\" I told him.\n\n\"It kept me from being bored,\" Holmes replied with a yawn. \"My life is a constant effort to escape the ordinary; these mysteries are my relief.\"\n\n\"And you’re a benefactor to humanity,\" I said.\n\nHe shrugged. \"Well, perhaps I contribute a little,\" he mused. \"As Flaubert said, ‘The man is nothing; the work is everything.’\""

          "text_segment": "“My dear fellow,” said Sherlock Holmes as we sat on either side of the fire in his lodgings at Baker Street, “life is infinitely stranger than anything which the mind of man could invent. We would not dare to conceive the things which are really mere commonplaces of existence. If we could fly out of that window hand in hand, hover over this great city, gently remove the roofs, and peep in at the queer things which are going on, the strange coincidences, the plannings, the cross-purposes, the wonderful chains of events, working through generations, and leading to the most outré results, it would make all fiction with its conventionalities and foreseen conclusions most stale and unprofitable.”\n“And yet I am not convinced of it,” I answered. “The cases which come to light in the papers are, as a rule, bald enough, and vulgar enough. We have in our police reports realism pushed to its extreme limits, and yet the result is, it must be confessed, neither fascinating nor artistic.”\n“A certain selection and discretion must be used in producing a realistic effect,” remarked Holmes. “This is wanting in the police report, where more stress is laid, perhaps, upon the platitudes of the magistrate than upon the details, which to an observer contain the vital essence of the whole matter. Depend upon it, there is nothing so unnatural as the commonplace.”\nI smiled and shook my head. “I can quite understand your thinking so,” I said. “Of course, in your position of unofficial adviser and helper to everybody who is absolutely puzzled, throughout three continents, you are brought in contact with all that is strange and bizarre. But here”—I picked up the morning paper from the ground—“let us put it to a practical test. Here is the first heading upon which I come. ‘A husband’s cruelty to his wife.’ There is half a column of print, but I know without reading it that it is all perfectly familiar to me. There is, of course, the other woman, the drink, the push, the blow, the bruise, the sympathetic sister or landlady. The crudest of writers could invent nothing more crude.”\n“Indeed, your example is an unfortunate one for your argument,” said Holmes, taking the paper and glancing his eye down it. “This is the Dundas separation case, and, as it happens, I was engaged in clearing up some small points in connection with it. The husband was a teetotaler, there was no other woman, and the conduct complained of was that he had drifted into the habit of winding up every meal by taking out his false teeth and hurling them at his wife, which, you will allow, is not an action likely to occur to the imagination of the average story-teller. Take a pinch of snuff, Doctor, and acknowledge that I have scored over you in your example.”",
          "paraphrase_gemini-2.5-flash-preview-04-17": "As we sat by the fire in his Baker Street rooms, Sherlock Holmes commented, “My dear fellow, reality is far more peculiar than anything the human mind can dream up. We wouldn’t dare to imagine the events that are, in truth, simply everyday occurrences. If we could magically float out the window and look down into this vast city, gently lifting roofs and observing the strange things happening inside—the odd coincidences, the plans being made, the conflicting intentions, the incredible chains of events unfolding over generations and leading to truly outlandish results—it would make all conventional fiction, with its predictable plots, seem utterly dull and uninteresting.”\nI replied, “And yet, I’m not convinced. The cases that appear in the newspapers are usually quite plain and ordinary. Our police reports offer extreme realism, but one must admit the outcome is neither engaging nor artistic.”\nHolmes responded, “Producing a realistic effect requires careful selection and judgment. This is missing in police reports, which perhaps focus more on the platitudes of the magistrate than on the details that, for an observer, contain the crucial essence of the whole matter. Believe me, nothing is as contrary to nature as the commonplace.”\nI smiled and shook my head. “I can certainly understand why you think that,” I said. “Of course, in your position as an unofficial consultant and assistant to everyone completely bewildered across three continents, you encounter everything strange and bizarre. But here,”—I picked up the morning paper from the floor—“let’s test it practically. Here’s the first headline I see: ‘A husband’s cruelty to his wife.’ There’s half a column, but I know without reading it that it’s all completely familiar. There will be the other woman, the alcohol, the push, the punch, the bruise, the sympathetic sister or landlady. The most unimaginative writer couldn’t invent anything less original.”\n“Indeed, your example is unfortunate for your argument,” said Holmes, taking the paper and quickly scanning it. “This is the Dundas separation case, and as it happens, I was involved in clarifying some minor details related to it. The husband drank no alcohol, there was no other woman, and the behaviour complained about was his habit of finishing every meal by taking out his false teeth and throwing them at his wife. You must admit that’s not an action likely to cross the mind of the average storyteller. Take a pinch of snuff, Doctor, and acknowledge that I’ve won the point on your example.”",

We wouldn’t even imagine what turns out to be everyday reality. If we could both float outside that window, look down on the city, and peel back rooftops to spy on the odd happenings inside—the odd coincidences, intentions clashing, and curious events unfolding over generations leading to unexpected outcomes—it would make all stories seem predictable and dull by comparison.\" \n\nI replied, \"I’m not so sure. The cases in the newspapers seem ordinary and rough, lacking any real charm or creativity. Our police reports go for harsh realism, but they aren’t exactly captivating either.\"\n\nHolmes responded, \"Realistic effects require careful selection and judgement. That’s what’s missing from police reports, which focus too much on the routine words of magistrates rather than the telling details that are the heart of the matter. Believe me, nothing is as strange as the so-called ordinary.\"\n\nI smiled in disagreement. \"I see why you’d think that,\" I said. \"After all, in your job of unofficially helping people from around the world with their most puzzling problems, you see plenty of unusual cases. But let’s check my point—\" I picked up the morning paper. \"Here’s the first headline: ‘A husband’s cruelty to his wife.’ I don’t even need to read it. I already know it: another woman, drinking, physical violence, a kind sister or landlord. Even a bad writer could make up something as simple.\"\n\nHolmes took the paper, glanced at it, and said, \"Unfortunately, your example doesn’t support your argument. This Dundas separation case—I actually helped clarify some aspects of it. The husband didn’t drink, there was no other woman, and the issue was that after every meal he had gotten into the habit of pulling out his false teeth and throwing them at his wife. Now, that’s not something your average fiction writer would imagine! Take a pinch of snuff, Doctor, and admit that this time, my example prevails over yours.\""

Looking over his shoulder, I saw that on the pavement opposite there stood a large woman with a heavy fur boa round her neck, and a large curling red feather in a broad-brimmed hat which was tilted in a coquettish Duchess of Devonshire fashion over her ear. From under this great panoply she peeped up in a nervous, hesitating fashion at our windows, while her body oscillated backward and forward, and her fingers fidgeted with her glove buttons. Suddenly, with a plunge, as of the swimmer who leaves the bank, she hurried across the road, and we heard the sharp clang of the bell.\n“I have seen those symptoms before,” said Holmes, throwing his cigarette into the fire. “Oscillation upon the pavement always means an affaire de cœur.

But here she comes in person to resolve our doubts.”\nAs he spoke there was a tap at the door, and the boy in buttons entered to announce Miss Mary Sutherland, while the lady herself loomed behind his small black figure like a full-sailed merchant-man behind a tiny pilot boat. Sherlock Holmes welcomed her with the easy courtesy for which he was remarkable, and, having closed the door and bowed her into an armchair, he looked her over in the minute and yet abstracted fashion which was peculiar to him.\n“Do you not find,” he said, “that with your short sight it is a little trying to do so much typewriting?”",

Peering over his shoulder, I could see a sizable woman on the opposite pavement. She had a heavy fur stole wrapped around her neck and wore a large, curled red feather in a wide-brimmed hat, which was tilted over her ear in a deliberately stylish way, like a Duchess of Devonshire. Hidden mostly by this elaborate outfit, she nervously and hesitantly glanced up at our windows, while her body swayed back and forth, and her fingers fiddled with the buttons on her glove. Suddenly, with a movement like someone diving off a riverbank, she rushed across the road, and we heard the distinct ring of the doorbell. “I've seen these signs before,” said Holmes, tossing his cigarette into the fireplace. “That hesitant swaying on the pavement nearly always indicates a romantic entanglement, an affaire de cœur. She wants advice but isn't sure if the matter is too personal to share. Yet, we can distinguish further even here. When a woman has been seriously wronged by a man, she no longer hesitates, and the usual sign is a broken bell wire. Here, we can assume it's a love issue, but the young lady is not so much angry as confused or upset. But now she is here in person to clear up our questions.” As he spoke, there was a tap at the door, and the pageboy entered to announce Miss Mary Sutherland. The lady herself appeared behind his small dark shape like a fully-rigged merchant ship following a tiny pilot boat. Sherlock Holmes welcomed her with the effortless politeness for which he was notable. After closing the door and ushering her into an armchair, he examined her minutely yet with a detached air that was characteristic of him. “Given your short sight,” he said, “do you not find that doing so much typewriting is a little strenuous?”",

Glancing over his shoulder, I noticed a large woman standing on the sidewalk across from us. She wore a thick fur scarf around her neck and had a broad hat decorated with a large, curling red feather, set at a daring, fashionable angle reminiscent of the Duchess of Devonshire. From beneath her impressive headgear, she nervously glanced up at our windows, hesitating and fidgeting with her glove buttons, rocking back and forth. Suddenly, as if summoning her courage like a swimmer plunging into water, she crossed the street quickly, and we were met with the sharp sound of the doorbell.\n\n\"I've seen that behavior before,\" said Holmes, tossing his cigarette into the fireplace. \"When I see someone pacing up and down like that on the pavement, it almost always indicates a romantic issue. She wants advice but isn't sure if the situation is too sensitive to discuss. There's a subtle difference, though—if a woman has been truly wronged by a man, she hesitates less and often pulls the bell so hard it breaks. In this case, it seems to involve a love affair, but the woman is more confused or troubled than angry. Now, here she comes to clear up our uncertainties.\"\n\nAs he finished speaking, there was a knock at the door, and the pageboy entered to introduce Miss Mary Sutherland. The lady herself appeared imposing behind the boy, as large as a merchant ship following a small pilot boat. Holmes greeted her with his signature graciousness. He gently closed the door, invited her to sit, and observed her closely in his meticulous but distant manner.\n\n\"Tell me,\" he began, \"don’t you find it a bit difficult to do so much typewriting with your poor eyesight?\""

Perhaps I have trained myself to see what others overlook.

I'd sacrifice every bit of it to find out what happened to Mr. Hosmer Angel.\" Sherlock Holmes inquired, his fingertips pressed together and his gaze directed upwards at the ceiling, \"Why did you rush off like that to come and consult me?\" A look of surprise crossed Miss Mary Sutherland's rather simple face once more. \"Yes, I certainly stormed out of the house,\" she admitted, \"because I was furious at how calmly Mr. Windibank—my father, that is—was reacting to everything. He refused to contact the police, and he refused to come to you.

I wasn’t best pleased, Mr. Holmes, when she married again so soon after father’s death, and a man who was nearly fifteen years younger than herself. Father was a plumber in the Tottenham Court Road, and he left a tidy business behind him, which mother carried on with Mr. Hardy, the foreman; but when Mr. Windibank came he made her sell the business, for he was very superior, being a traveller in wines. They got £ 4700 for the goodwill and interest, which wasn’t near as much as father could have got if he had been alive.”\nI had expected to see Sherlock Holmes impatient under this rambling and inconsequential narrative, but, on the contrary, he had listened with the greatest concentration of attention.\n“Your own little income,” he asked, “does it come out of the business?”\n“Oh, no, sir. It is quite separate and was left me by my uncle Ned in Auckland. It is in New Zealand stock, paying 4½ per cent. Two thousand five hundred pounds was the amount, but I can only touch the interest.”\n“You interest me extremely,” said Holmes. “And since you draw so large a sum as a hundred a year, with what you earn into the bargain, you no doubt travel a little and indulge yourself in every way. I believe that a single lady can get on very nicely upon an income of about £ 60.”\n“I could do with much less than that, Mr. Holmes, but you understand that as long as I live at home I don’t wish to be a burden to them, and so they have the use of the money just while I am staying with them. Of course, that is only just for the time. Mr. Windibank draws my interest every quarter and pays it over to mother, and I find that I can do pretty well with what I earn at typewriting. It brings me twopence a sheet, and I can often do from fifteen to twenty sheets in a day.”\n“You have made your position very clear to me,” said Holmes. “This is my friend, Dr. Watson, before whom you can speak as freely as before myself. Kindly tell us now all about your connection with Mr. Hosmer Angel.”",
          "paraphrase_gemini-2.5-flash-preview-04-17": "Inquiring if her mother was still alive, Holmes received confirmation that she was in good health. The visitor admitted she was unhappy with her mother remarrying so quickly after her father's passing, especially to a man nearly fifteen years her junior. Her father, a plumber on Tottenham Court Road, had left a thriving business which her mother initially continued with the foreman, Mr. Hardy. However, her new husband, Mr. Windibank, a self-important wine salesman, insisted she sell it. They received £4700 for the business's value and assets, which was significantly less than her father could have achieved. I had expected Holmes to be impatient with this lengthy and irrelevant account, but instead, he listened with exceptional focus. He then asked if her small personal income came from the business. She explained it was entirely separate, inherited from her uncle Ned in Auckland, New Zealand, invested in stock yielding 4.5% interest on £2500, adding that she could only access the interest, not the principal. Holmes commented that this substantial sum of a hundred pounds annually, combined with her earnings, should allow her comfortable travel and leisure, noting that a single woman could live quite comfortably on about £60 a year. She replied that she could manage on far less, but as she lived at home, she didn't want to be a burden and allowed her parents the use of her money during her stay. Mr. Windibank collected the quarterly interest and paid it to her mother. She found she could manage quite well on her income from typewriting, earning two pence per sheet and often producing fifteen to twenty sheets daily. Holmes stated that her situation was now very clear. He then introduced me, Dr. Watson, assuring her she could speak as openly before me as before him, and asked her to share everything about her association with Mr. Hosmer Angel.",
          "paraphrase_gpt-4.1-2025-04-14": "\"And your mother is living?\"\n\"Oh yes, she is alive and in good health. To be honest, Mr. Holmes, I wasn’t too happy when she remarried so soon after my father passed away, especially since her new husband is almost fifteen years younger than she is. My father used to be a plumber on Tottenham Court Road and he left a successful business, which mother managed together with Mr. Hardy, our foreman. However, when Mr. Windibank came into the picture, he persuaded her to sell the business. He considered himself above such work because he was a wine merchant. They ended up selling the business for £4700, including its goodwill and assets, though that was much less than my father could have managed if he were alive.\"\nI thought Sherlock Holmes would grow impatient with this meandering account, but instead, he listened with keen interest.\n\"And your own personal income? Does it come from that business?\"\n\"No, sir. It’s separate and comes from my uncle Ned in Auckland, who left it to me. The money is invested in New Zealand stock yielding 4.5 percent. The total sum is £2,500, but I can only access the interest.\"\n\"That is very interesting,\" Holmes replied. \"Since you receive as much as a hundred pounds a year, plus whatever you earn yourself, I suppose you have some freedom to travel and treat yourself. I understand that a single woman can live quite comfortably on about £60 a year.\"\n\"Actually, Mr. Holmes, I could manage on less than that. Still, as long as I live at home, I don’t want to be an expense to the family, so they use the interest from my money while I am living with them. This is only temporary. Mr. Windibank collects my quarterly interest and passes it on to my mother, and I am able to manage on my income from typewriting, which pays two pence per sheet, and I can produce fifteen to twenty sheets a day.\"\n\"Thank you, you have explained your situation very clearly,\" said Holmes. \"This gentleman is my friend Dr. Watson, with whom you may speak as openly as with me.

          "text_segment": "A flush stole over Miss Sutherland’s face, and she picked nervously at the fringe of her jacket. “I met him first at the gasfitters’ ball,” she said. “They used to send father tickets when he was alive, and then afterwards they remembered us, and sent them to mother. Mr. Windibank did not wish us to go. He never did wish us to go anywhere. He would get quite mad if I wanted so much as to join a Sunday-school treat. But this time I was set on going, and I would go; for what right had he to prevent? He said the folk were not fit for us to know, when all father’s friends were to be there. And he said that I had nothing fit to wear, when I had my purple plush that I had never so much as taken out of the drawer. At last, when nothing else would do, he went off to France upon the business of the firm, but we went, mother and I, with Mr. Hardy, who used to be our foreman, and it was there I met Mr. Hosmer Angel.”\n“I suppose,” said Holmes, “that when Mr. Windibank came back from France he was very annoyed at your having gone to the ball.”\n“Oh, well, he was very good about it. He laughed, I remember, and shrugged his shoulders, and said there was no use denying anything to a woman, for she would have her way.”\n“I see. Then at the gasfitters’ ball you met, as I understand, a gentleman called Mr. Hosmer Angel.”\n“Yes, sir. I met him that night, and he called next day to ask if we had got home all safe, and after that we met him—that is to say, Mr. Holmes, I met him twice for walks, but after that father came back again, and Mr. Hosmer Angel could not come to the house any more.”\n“No?”\n“Well, you know father didn’t like anything of the sort. He wouldn’t have any visitors if he could help it, and he used to say that a woman should be happy in her own family circle. But then, as I used to say to mother, a woman wants her own circle to begin with, and I had not got mine yet.”\n“But how about Mr. Hosmer Angel? Did he make no attempt to see you?”\n“Well, father was going off to France again in a week, and Hosmer wrote and said that it would be safer and better not to see each other until he had gone. We could write in the meantime, and he used to write every day. I took the letters in in the morning, so there was no need for father to know.”\n“Were you engaged to the gentleman at this time?”\n“Oh, yes, Mr. Holmes. We were engaged after the first walk that we took. Hosmer—Mr. Angel—was a cashier in an office in Leadenhall Street—and—”\n“What office?”\n“That’s the worst of it, Mr. Holmes, I don’t know.”\n“Where did he live, then?”\n“He slept on the premises.”\n“And you don’t know his address?”\n“No—except that it was Leadenhall Street.”\n“Where did you address your letters, then?”\n“To the Leadenhall Street Post Office, to be left till called for. He said that if they were sent to the office he would be chaffed by all the other clerks about having letters from a lady, so I offered to typewrite them, like he did his, but he wouldn’t have that, for he said that when I wrote them they seemed to come from me, but when they were typewritten he always felt that the machine had come between us. That will just show you how fond he was of me, Mr. Holmes, and the little things that he would think of.”\n“It was most suggestive,” said Holmes. “It has long been an axiom of mine that the little things are infinitely the most important. Can you remember any other little things about Mr. Hosmer Angel?”\n“He was a very shy man, Mr. Holmes. He would rather walk with me in the evening than in the daylight, for he said that he hated to be conspicuous. Very retiring and gentlemanly he was. Even his voice was gentle. He’d had the quinsy and swollen glands when he was young, he told me, and it had left him with a weak throat, and a hesitating, whispering fashion of speech. He was always well dressed, very neat and plain, but his eyes were weak, just as mine are, and he wore tinted glasses against the glare.”",
          "paraphrase_gemini-2.5-flash-preview-04-17": "A blush spread across Miss Sutherland's face, and she nervously fidgeted with the fringe of her jacket. \"I first encountered him at the gasfitters' ball,\" she explained. \"Father used to receive tickets when he was alive, and after his passing, they remembered us and sent them to Mother. Mr. Windibank didn't want us to attend. He consistently opposed us going out anywhere. He would become quite upset if I merely suggested going to a Sunday-school treat. But this time, I was determined to go, and I insisted; for what right did he have to forbid me? He claimed the people there weren't suitable for us, even though all of Father's friends would be present. And he said I had nothing appropriate to wear, when I possessed my purple plush dress that I hadn't even worn yet. Eventually, when he couldn't dissuade me otherwise, he departed for France on company business, but we went, Mother and I, accompanied by Mr. Hardy, who was our former foreman, and that is where I met Mr. Hosmer Angel.\" \"I presume,\" Holmes commented, \"that upon Mr. Windibank's return from France, he was quite displeased that you had attended the ball.\" \"Oh, actually, he took it very well. He laughed, I recall, and shrugged his shoulders, remarking that there was no point in forbidding anything to a woman, as she would always get her way.\" \"I understand. So, at the gasfitters' ball, you met, as I gather, a gentleman named Mr. Hosmer Angel.\" \"Yes, sir. I met him that evening, and he called the next day to inquire if we had arrived home safely, and after that, we met him—that is to say, Mr. Holmes, I met him for two walks, but subsequent to that, Father returned, and Mr. Hosmer Angel could no longer visit the house.\" \"Why not?\" \"Well, you see, Father didn't approve of such things. He avoided having visitors if possible, and he used to assert that a woman should be content within her own family circle. However, as I often told Mother, a woman needs her own circle to establish herself, and I had not yet formed mine.\" \"But regarding Mr. Hosmer Angel? Did he not attempt to see you?\" \"Well, Father was scheduled to leave for France again in a week, and Hosmer wrote suggesting it would be safer and better if we didn't meet until he had departed. We could write in the interim, and he wrote every day. I collected the letters in the morning, so there was no need for Father to know.\" \"Were you engaged to the gentleman at this point?\" \"Oh, yes, Mr. Holmes. We became engaged after our first walk. Hosmer—Mr. Angel—was a cashier at an office on Leadenhall Street—and—\" \"Which office?\" \"That is the difficulty, Mr. Holmes, I don't know.\" \"Then where did he reside?\" \"He lodged on the business premises.\" \"And you are unaware of his address?\" \"No—except that it was Leadenhall Street.\" \"How then did you send your letters?\" \"To the Leadenhall Street Post Office, marked to be held until called for. He explained that if they were sent to his office, the other clerks would tease him about receiving letters from a lady, so I offered to typewrite them, as he did his, but he declined, saying that when I wrote them in my hand, they felt like they truly came from me, but when typewritten, he always felt a machine came between us. That simply shows how fond he was of me, Mr. Holmes, and the thoughtful little things he would consider.\" \"That is highly revealing,\" Holmes commented. \"It has long been my conviction that the seemingly minor details are always the most significant. Can you recall any other small particulars about Mr. Hosmer Angel?\" \"He was a very timid man, Mr. Holmes. He preferred walking with me in the evenings rather than during the day, explaining that he disliked attracting attention. He was very reserved and gentlemanly. Even his voice was soft. He told me he had suffered from quinsy and swollen glands when he was young, which left him with a fragile throat and a hesitant, hushed manner of speaking. He was always neatly and simply dressed, but his eyesight was poor, just like mine, and he wore tinted spectacles to guard against bright light.\"",

Mr. Windibank didn’t want us to attend—actually, he never wanted us to go out anywhere. He’d get angry if I even mentioned joining a Sunday-school outing. But this time, I was determined to go, and didn’t see why he should stop me. He claimed the attendees weren’t suitable company, even though all father's friends would be there. He also argued that I didn’t have anything appropriate to wear, even though I had a brand new purple plush dress.

That’s where I met Mr. Hosmer Angel.”\n\nHolmes remarked, \"I assume when Mr. Windibank returned and found out you’d gone, he was quite upset.\"\n\n\"Actually, he handled it well.

He said if they went to the office, he’d be teased by the other clerks about getting mail from a lady.

That shows how much he cared for me and the little details he noticed.\"\n\n\"That’s quite telling,\" Holmes replied. \"It’s often the small details that matter most. Can you recall any other little things about Mr. Hosmer Angel?\"\n\n\"He was very timid, Mr. Holmes. He preferred walking with me in the evenings instead of during the day because he disliked drawing attention to himself. Very reserved and gentlemanly, with a gentle voice—he once told me he’d suffered from quinsy and swollen glands as a child, which left him with a weak throat and a soft, hesitant way of speaking. He always dressed neatly and plainly, and, like me, his eyes were sensitive, so he wore tinted glasses to protect against the light.\""

He was in dreadful earnest and made me swear, with my hands on the Testament, that whatever happened I would always be true to him. Mother said he was quite right to make me swear, and that it was a sign of his passion. Mother was all in his favour from the first and was even fonder of him than I was. Then, when they talked of marrying within the week, I began to ask about father; but they both said never to mind about father, but just to tell him afterwards, and mother said she would make it all right with him. I didn’t quite like that, Mr. Holmes. It seemed funny that I should ask his leave, as he was only a few years older than me; but I didn’t want to do anything on the sly, so I wrote to father at Bordeaux, where the company has its French offices, but the letter came back to me on the very morning of the wedding.”\n“It missed him, then?”\n“Yes, sir; for he had started to England just before it arrived.”\n“Ha! that was unfortunate. Your wedding was arranged, then, for the Friday. Was it to be in church?”\n“Yes, sir, but very quietly. It was to be at St. Saviour’s, near King’s Cross, and we were to have breakfast afterwards at the St. Pancras Hotel. Hosmer came for us in a hansom, but as there were two of us he put us both into it and stepped himself into a four-wheeler, which happened to be the only other cab in the street. We got to the church first, and when the four-wheeler drove up we waited for him to step out, but he never did, and when the cabman got down from the box and looked there was no one there! The cabman said that he could not imagine what had become of him, for he had seen him get in with his own eyes. That was last Friday, Mr. Holmes, and I have never seen or heard anything since then to throw any light upon what became of him.”\n“It seems to me that you have been very shamefully treated,” said Holmes.\n“Oh, no, sir! He was too good and kind to leave me so. Why, all the morning he was saying to me that, whatever happened, I was to be true; and that even if something quite unforeseen occurred to separate us, I was always to remember that I was pledged to him, and that he would claim his pledge sooner or later. It seemed strange talk for a wedding-morning, but what has happened since gives a meaning to it.”\n“Most certainly it does. Your own opinion is, then, that some unforeseen catastrophe has occurred to him?”\n“Yes, sir. I believe that he foresaw some danger, or else he would not have talked so. And then I think that what he foresaw happened.”\n“But you have no notion as to what it could have been?”\n“None.”\n“One more question. How did your mother take the matter?”\n“She was angry, and said that I was never to speak of the matter again.”\n“And your father? Did you tell him?”\n“Yes; and he seemed to think, with me, that something had happened, and that I should hear of Hosmer again. As he said, what interest could anyone have in bringing me to the doors of the church, and then leaving me? Now, if he had borrowed my money, or if he had married me and got my money settled on him, there might be some reason, but Hosmer was very independent about money and never would look at a shilling of mine. And yet, what could have happened? And why could he not write? Oh, it drives me half-mad to think of it, and I can’t sleep a wink at night.” She pulled a little handkerchief out of her muff and began to sob heavily into it.",

Where is your father employed?” Holmes inquired.\n\n“He works as a traveling salesman for Westhouse & Marbank, the prominent importers of claret wine located on Fenchurch Street,” she explained.\n\n“Thank you. You have presented your account very clearly,” Holmes acknowledged. “You should leave these documents with me and heed the advice I have given you. Treat the entire occurrence as something finished and closed, and do not allow it to trouble your life.”\n\n“You are very kind, Mr. Holmes, but I cannot follow that advice,” she declared. “I will remain loyal to Hosmer. He will find me waiting when he comes back.”\n\nDespite her ridiculous hat and seemingly naive expression, there was a noble quality in our visitor’s straightforward loyalty that earned our respect.

You have really done very well indeed. It is true that you have missed everything of importance, but you have hit upon the method, and you have a quick eye for colour. Never trust to general impressions, my boy, but concentrate yourself upon details. My first glance is always at a woman’s sleeve. In a man it is perhaps better first to take the knee of the trouser.

You'll see similar cases if you look up my records—Andover, 1877, and something akin happened in The Hague just last year. Still, although the situation was familiar, there were one or two new aspects. But it was the woman herself who proved most enlightening.\"\n\n\"You seemed to notice a lot about her that I completely missed,\" I commented.\n\n\"Not invisible, Watson—just overlooked. You didn’t know where to focus, so you missed all the important points. I can never make you understand the significance of sleeves, the clues in thumbnails, or the big revelations a bootlace can bring. Tell me, what details do you recall about her?\"\n\n\"She wore a slate-coloured, wide-brimmed straw hat with a reddish-brown feather. Her jacket was black, decorated with black beads and trimmed with small black jet ornaments. Her dress was a dark brown, deeper than coffee, with some purple velvet at the collar and cuffs. Her gloves were grey and worn through at the right forefinger. I didn’t pay attention to her boots. She had small, round, dangling gold earrings and looked generally prosperous in a somewhat garish and relaxed way.\"\n\nHolmes gently clapped and laughed.\n\n\"Really, Watson, you’re improving. You’ve done quite well! True, you missed everything crucial, but your method is better and you notice colours. Don’t rely on general impressions—focus on specifics. I always start by looking at a woman’s sleeves. With men, I usually check the knees of the trousers first. In this case, the plush on her sleeves was revealing—it had marks above the wrist consistent with a typist resting her arms on a table. A sewing machine might leave a similar mark, but only on the left sleeve and in a different spot, whereas these were right across. When I looked at her face, I saw dents from eyeglasses on both sides of her nose, so I deduced she was near-sighted and typed—a fact that seemed to take her by surprise.\"\n\n\"It surprised me, too.\"\n\n\"But it was quite evident. Then, to my interest, I noticed her boots didn't match exactly. One had a decorated cap, the other a plain one. The buttons were fastened differently on each. When you see a neatly dressed young woman with mismatched, half-buttoned boots, it’s clear she left in a hurry.\"\n\n\"What else did you observe?\" I asked, always fascinated by Holmes’s sharp thinking.\n\n\"I also noticed she had written a note after dressing but before leaving home—you saw her right glove was torn, but did you also notice ink stains from violet ink on both glove and finger? She wrote in a rush and dipped the pen too far. It must have happened this morning, or the stain wouldn't still be there. All entertaining—if easy—but now back to business. Watson, would you please read me the newspaper notice describing Mr. Hosmer Angel?\""

However, I shall write two letters, which should settle the matter.

He was known to work in an office on Leadenhall Street. The notice requested information from anyone bringing it forward. Holmes interrupted, saying that was enough. He then looked over the letters, remarking that they were quite common and provided no specific details about Mr. Angel, apart from a single quote from Balzac. He added that there was one notable feature he was sure I would spot. I pointed out that they were typewritten. Holmes confirmed this, adding that the signature itself, the neat little 'Hosmer Angel' at the bottom, was also typewritten. He observed there was a date but no clear address beyond the vague 'Leadenhall Street'. He emphasized that the typewritten signature was very suggestive, even decisive. When I asked what it proved, Holmes questioned why I didn't see its clear importance to the case. I confessed I did not, unless it was intended to allow him to deny signing if sued for breach of promise. Holmes disagreed that was the point. He then stated he would write two letters to settle things: one to a company in the City and the other to the young lady's stepfather, Mr. Windibank, asking him to meet them at six the next evening, noting his preference for dealing with the male family members.

See the tidy 'Hosmer Angel' at the end. There's a date, but instead of a full address, only 'Leadenhall Street,' which is quite unhelpful. The typewritten signature is particularly noteworthy—actually, it may be decisive.\"\n\n\"Why is that?\"\n\n\"My friend, surely you see how this impacts the case?\"\n\n\"I can't see it, unless perhaps he wanted to be able to deny signing the letters in case he was sued for breaking a promise.\"\n\n\"No, that's not the reason. Anyway, I’m going to send two letters that will clarify the matter—one to a company in the City, and the other to the young lady’s stepfather, Mr. Windibank, inviting him to meet us here at six tomorrow evening.

I apologize for my slight delay, but I'm not entirely free to manage my own time, you see. I regret that Miss Sutherland has troubled you with this small matter; I believe it's much better to keep such private issues out of the public eye. Her coming was completely against my wishes, but as you may have noticed, she is a very high-strung, impulsive young woman and quite stubborn once she's made up her mind. Of course, I didn't object as much to you, since you aren't connected to the official police, but it's unpleasant to have a family misfortune like this broadcast widely. Furthermore, it's a useless expense, as how could you possibly hope to locate this Hosmer Angel?\" \"On the contrary,\" Holmes stated calmly, \"I have every reason to be confident that I will succeed in finding Mr. Hosmer Angel.\" Mr. Windibank was visibly startled, dropping his gloves. \"I'm delighted to hear that,\" he said. \"It's rather fascinating,\" Holmes remarked, \"how a typewriter can possess as much distinct character as a person's handwriting. Unless they are brand new, no two machines produce text that is exactly identical. Some keys become more worn than others, and the wear can be uneven. Now, in this note of yours, Mr. Windibank, you'll notice that in every instance, there's a slight blur on the 'e,' and a small imperfection in the curl of the 'r's tail. There are fourteen other distinguishing features, but those are the most apparent.\" \"We use this machine for all our correspondence at the office, and I have no doubt it shows some wear,\" our visitor replied, observing Holmes intently with his bright small eyes. \"And now I will demonstrate what is truly a very compelling subject, Mr. Windibank,\" Holmes continued. \"I've considered writing another brief study sometime on the typewriter and its link to criminal investigations.

Holmes stuck his feet up on the corner of the mantelpiece and, leaning back with his hands in his pockets, began talking, rather to himself, as it seemed, than to us.\n“The man married a woman very much older than himself for her money,” said he, “and he enjoyed the use of the money of the daughter as long as she lived with them. It was a considerable sum, for people in their position, and the loss of it would have made a serious difference. It was worth an effort to preserve it. The daughter was of a good, amiable disposition, but affectionate and warm-hearted in her ways, so that it was evident that with her fair personal advantages, and her little income, she would not be allowed to remain single long. Now her marriage would mean, of course, the loss of a hundred a year, so what does her stepfather do to prevent it? He takes the obvious course of keeping her at home and forbidding her to seek the company of people of her own age. But soon he found that that would not answer forever. She became restive, insisted upon her rights, and finally announced her positive intention of going to a certain ball. What does her clever stepfather do then? He conceives an idea more creditable to his head than to his heart. With the connivance and assistance of his wife he disguised himself, covered those keen eyes with tinted glasses, masked the face with a moustache and a pair of bushy whiskers, sunk that clear voice into an insinuating whisper, and doubly secure on account of the girl’s short sight, he appears as Mr. Hosmer Angel, and keeps off other lovers by making love himself.”\n“It was only a joke at first,” groaned our visitor. “We never thought that she would have been so carried away.”\n“Very likely not. However that may be, the young lady was very decidedly carried away, and, having quite made up her mind that her stepfather was in France, the suspicion of treachery never for an instant entered her mind. She was flattered by the gentleman’s attentions, and the effect was increased by the loudly expressed admiration of her mother. Then Mr. Angel began to call, for it was obvious that the matter should be pushed as far as it would go if a real effect were to be produced. There were meetings, and an engagement, which would finally secure the girl’s affections from turning towards anyone else. But the deception could not be kept up forever. These pretended journeys to France were rather cumbrous. The thing to do was clearly to bring the business to an end in such a dramatic manner that it would leave a permanent impression upon the young lady’s mind and prevent her from looking upon any other suitor for some time to come. Hence those vows of fidelity exacted upon a Testament, and hence also the allusions to a possibility of something happening on the very morning of the wedding. James Windibank wished Miss Sutherland to be so bound to Hosmer Angel, and so uncertain as to his fate, that for ten years to come, at any rate, she would not listen to another man. As far as the church door he brought her, and then, as he could go no farther, he conveniently vanished away by the old trick of stepping in at one door of a four-wheeler and out at the other. I think that was the chain of events, Mr. Windibank!”",
          "paraphrase_gemini-2.5-flash-preview-04-17": "The man remained slumped in his chair, his head bowed towards his chest, looking utterly defeated. Meanwhile, Holmes put his feet up on the mantelpiece, leaned back with his hands in his pockets, and began speaking, seemingly more to himself than to us. He stated that the man had married a woman significantly older than himself primarily for her money, and he benefited from the funds belonging to her daughter for as long as she lived with them. This sum was quite substantial for people in their situation, and its loss would have had serious repercussions, making its preservation a worthwhile endeavor. The daughter was described as good-natured and kind, with an affectionate and warm personality, and her personal attractiveness and small income made it clear she wouldn't remain single for long. Her marriage would naturally mean losing a hundred pounds a year, so her stepfather's initial response was to keep her at home and prevent her from socializing with people her own age. However, he soon realized this wouldn't work indefinitely. She grew restless, asserted her rights, and eventually declared her firm intention to attend a specific ball. So, what did her cunning stepfather do then? He devised a plan that was clever rather than honorable. With his wife's assistance and agreement, he disguised himself, covering his sharp eyes with tinted glasses, masking his face with a moustache and thick whiskers, lowering his clear voice to an insinuating whisper, and, secure in the knowledge of the girl's poor eyesight, he appeared as Mr. Hosmer Angel, keeping other potential suitors away by romancing her himself. Our visitor groaned, admitting it was only a joke initially and they never anticipated she would become so infatuated. Holmes responded that it was quite likely, regardless; the young lady was indeed very decisively carried away, and having completely convinced herself that her stepfather was in France, the thought of betrayal never crossed her mind for a moment. She was pleased by the gentleman's attention, an effect amplified by her mother's strong expressions of admiration. Then Mr. Angel started making visits, as it was evident the matter needed to be pursued as far as possible to achieve a real impact. There were meetings and an engagement, which would ultimately secure the girl's affections and prevent them from turning towards anyone else. But the deception couldn't be maintained indefinitely. These fabricated trips to France were rather inconvenient. The obvious course was to conclude the affair in such a dramatic way that it would leave a lasting impression on the young lady's mind and deter her from considering any other suitor for a considerable time. Hence, the solemn vows demanded on a Testament, and also the hints about something potentially happening on the very morning of the wedding. James Windibank wanted Miss Sutherland to feel so bound to Hosmer Angel, and so uncertain about his fate, that for at least ten years she would not consider another man. He escorted her as far as the church door, and then, unable to proceed further, he conveniently disappeared using the old trick of entering one door of a four-wheeled cab and exiting the other. Holmes finished, 'I believe that is the sequence of events, Mr. Windibank!'",
          "paraphrase_gpt-4.1-2025-04-14": "The man was slouched and despondent in his chair, looking completely defeated. Holmes, with his feet propped on the mantel and hands in his pockets, began speaking aloud, seemingly more to himself than to the group. He explained that the man had wed an older woman for her fortune, and also benefited from the daughter’s inheritance while she lived with them. Losing that money would have been a serious setback, so the man was motivated to retain it. The daughter, being kind, friendly, and attractive, was unlikely to remain unmarried for long, and her marriage would mean losing the extra income. To prevent this, her stepfather kept her isolated at home, restricting her from meeting people her age. But eventually she grew dissatisfied and insisted on attending a certain ball. Facing this challenge, her stepfather devised a cunning plan—hardly an ethical one. With his wife’s help, he disguised himself, using tinted glasses, fake whiskers, and a muted voice, so that, aided by the girl's poor eyesight, he posed as “Mr. Hosmer Angel.” By doing this, he actively kept other potential suitors away by courting her himself. The visitor admitted it was only meant as a prank, not expecting her to fall in love so deeply. Holmes replied that regardless of intent, the young lady became genuinely affected. Believing her stepfather was abroad, she never suspected any deceit, especially as her mother openly praised “Mr. Angel.” Frequent visits and courtship led to an engagement, ensuring her attachment was secure. However, the disguise couldn’t last. The story of trips to France was unwieldy, so it was decided to end matters dramatically, leaving an imprint on the girl's mind and dissuading her from future romances. This led to dramatic vows and hints of something happening on the wedding day itself. Windibank wanted Miss Sutherland so emotionally tied to the mysterious Mr. Angel and so uncertain of his fate that she wouldn’t consider other men for years. He brought her to the very church door, then disappeared by slipping out of a carriage, vanishing from her life. Holmes concluded by suggesting that's how the scheme unfolded."

I have done nothing actionable from the first, but as long as you keep that door locked you lay yourself open to an action for assault and illegal constraint.”\n“The law cannot, as you say, touch you,” said Holmes, unlocking and throwing open the door, “yet there never was a man who deserved punishment more. If the young lady has a brother or a friend, he ought to lay a whip across your shoulders. By Jove!” he continued, flushing up at the sight of the bitter sneer upon the man’s face, “it is not part of my duties to my client, but here’s a hunting crop handy, and I think I shall just treat myself to—” He took two swift steps to the whip, but before he could grasp it there was a wild clatter of steps upon the stairs, the heavy hall door banged, and from the window we could see Mr. James Windibank running at the top of his speed down the road.\n“There’s a cold-blooded scoundrel!” said Holmes, laughing, as he threw himself down into his chair once more. “That fellow will rise from crime to crime until he does something very bad, and ends on a gallows. The case has, in some respects, been not entirely devoid of interest.”\n“I cannot now entirely see all the steps of your reasoning,” I remarked.\n“Well, of course it was obvious from the first that this Mr. Hosmer Angel must have some strong object for his curious conduct, and it was equally clear that the only man who really profited by the incident, as far as we could see, was the stepfather. Then the fact that the two men were never together, but that the one always appeared when the other was away, was suggestive. So were the tinted spectacles and the curious voice, which both hinted at a disguise, as did the bushy whiskers. My suspicions were all confirmed by his peculiar action in typewriting his signature, which, of course, inferred that his handwriting was so familiar to her that she would recognise even the smallest sample of it. You see all these isolated facts, together with many minor ones, all pointed in the same direction.”\n“And how did you verify them?”\n“Having once spotted my man, it was easy to get corroboration. I knew the firm for which this man worked. Having taken the printed description. I eliminated everything from it which could be the result of a disguise—the whiskers, the glasses, the voice, and I sent it to the firm, with a request that they would inform me whether it answered to the description of any of their travellers. I had already noticed the peculiarities of the typewriter, and I wrote to the man himself at his business address asking him if he would come here. As I expected, his reply was typewritten and revealed the same trivial but characteristic defects. The same post brought me a letter from Westhouse & Marbank, of Fenchurch Street, to say that the description tallied in every respect with that of their employé, James Windibank. Voilà tout!”\n“And Miss Sutherland?”\n“If I tell her she will not believe me. You may remember the old Persian saying, ‘There is danger for him who taketh the tiger cub, and danger also for whoso snatches a delusion from a woman.’ There is as much sense in Hafiz as in Horace, and as much knowledge of the world.”",

'Perhaps, Mr. Holmes, or perhaps not,' he retorted. 'But if you are as clever as you claim, you should know that you are the one breaking the law now, not me. I haven't committed any illegal act, but by keeping that door locked, you are committing assault and illegal confinement.'\n\n'The law cannot touch you, as you rightly point out,' Holmes said, unlocking and opening the door. 'Yet, no man ever deserved punishment more. If the young woman had a brother or friend, they should give you a thrashing. Good heavens!' he continued, flushing with anger at the man's bitter expression. 'It isn't strictly my duty to my client, but I have a hunting crop right here, and I'm tempted to give myself a treat—' He quickly moved towards the whip, but before he could reach it, there was a rush of footsteps on the stairs, the main hall door slammed shut, and we saw Mr. James Windibank running at full speed down the street from the window.\n\n'What a heartless villain!' Holmes exclaimed, laughing as he sank back into his chair. 'That man will move from one crime to another until he commits something truly terrible and ends up on the gallows. The case, in some ways, was quite interesting.'\n\n'I still don't fully grasp all the steps in your reasoning,' I admitted.\n\n'Well, from the start, it was clear that this Mr. Hosmer Angel must have had a strong motive for his odd behavior,' Holmes explained. 'It was equally obvious that the only person who really gained from the situation was the stepfather. The fact that the two men were never present together—one always appearing when the other was absent—was a significant clue. So were the tinted glasses and unusual voice, both suggesting a disguise, as did the bushy whiskers. My suspicions were confirmed by his unique method of typewriting his signature, which strongly implied his handwriting was so familiar to her that she would recognize even a small sample. You see, all these separate details, along with many less important ones, all pointed in the same direction.'\n\n'And how did you confirm this?' I asked.\n\n'Once I identified the man, getting confirmation was simple. I knew the company he worked for. Taking the printed description, I removed everything that could be part of a disguise—the whiskers, the glasses, the voice—and sent it to the company, asking if it matched any of their traveling salesmen. I had already noted the typewriter's quirks, and I wrote to the man himself at his business address, inviting him here. As expected, his reply was typewritten and showed the same minor but distinctive flaws. The same mail delivery brought me a letter from Westhouse & Marbank, of Fenchurch Street, stating the description exactly matched their employee, James Windibank. That's all there was to it!'\n\n'And what about Miss Sutherland?' I inquired.\n\n'If I tell her, she won't believe me. You might recall the old Persian saying, 'There is danger for one who takes a tiger cub, and also danger for one who snatches a delusion from a woman.'

Among these he rummaged and read, with intervals of note-taking and of meditation, until we were past Reading. Then he suddenly rolled them all into a gigantic ball and tossed them up onto the rack.\n“Have you heard anything of the case?” he asked.\n“Not a word. I have not seen a paper for some days.”\n“The London press has not had very full accounts. I have just been looking through all the recent papers in order to master the particulars.

Singularity is almost invariably a clue. The more featureless and commonplace a crime is, the more difficult it is to bring it home. In this case, however, they have established a very serious case against the son of the murdered man.”\n“It is a murder, then?”\n“Well, it is conjectured to be so. I shall take nothing for granted until I have the opportunity of looking personally into it. I will explain the state of things to you, as far as I have been able to understand it, in a very few words.\n“Boscombe Valley is a country district not very far from Ross, in Herefordshire. The largest landed proprietor in that part is a Mr. John Turner, who made his money in Australia and returned some years ago to the old country. One of the farms which he held, that of Hatherley, was let to Mr. Charles McCarthy, who was also an ex-Australian. The men had known each other in the colonies, so that it was not unnatural that when they came to settle down they should do so as near each other as possible. Turner was apparently the richer man, so McCarthy became his tenant but still remained, it seems, upon terms of perfect equality, as they were frequently together. McCarthy had one son, a lad of eighteen, and Turner had an only daughter of the same age, but neither of them had wives living. They appear to have avoided the society of the neighbouring English families and to have led retired lives, though both the McCarthys were fond of sport and were frequently seen at the race-meetings of the neighbourhood. McCarthy kept two servants—a man and a girl. Turner had a considerable household, some half-dozen at the least. That is as much as I have been able to gather about the families. Now for the facts.\n“On June 3rd, that is, on Monday last, McCarthy left his house at Hatherley about three in the afternoon and walked down to the Boscombe Pool, which is a small lake formed by the spreading out of the stream which runs down the Boscombe Valley. He had been out with his serving-man in the morning at Ross, and he had told the man that he must hurry, as he had an appointment of importance to keep at three. From that appointment he never came back alive.\n“From Hatherley Farmhouse to the Boscombe Pool is a quarter of a mile, and two people saw him as he passed over this ground. One was an old woman, whose name is not mentioned, and the other was William Crowder, a game-keeper in the employ of Mr. Turner. Both these witnesses depose that Mr. McCarthy was walking alone. The game-keeper adds that within a few minutes of his seeing Mr. McCarthy pass he had seen his son, Mr. James McCarthy, going the same way with a gun under his arm. To the best of his belief, the father was actually in sight at the time, and the son was following him. He thought no more of the matter until he heard in the evening of the tragedy that had occurred.\n“The two McCarthys were seen after the time when William Crowder, the game-keeper, lost sight of them. The Boscombe Pool is thickly wooded round, with just a fringe of grass and of reeds round the edge. A girl of fourteen, Patience Moran, who is the daughter of the lodge-keeper of the Boscombe Valley estate, was in one of the woods picking flowers. She states that while she was there she saw, at the border of the wood and close by the lake, Mr. McCarthy and his son, and that they appeared to be having a violent quarrel. She heard Mr. McCarthy the elder using very strong language to his son, and she saw the latter raise up his hand as if to strike his father. She was so frightened by their violence that she ran away and told her mother when she reached home that she had left the two McCarthys quarrelling near Boscombe Pool, and that she was afraid that they were going to fight. She had hardly said the words when young Mr. McCarthy came running up to the lodge to say that he had found his father dead in the wood, and to ask for the help of the lodge-keeper. He was much excited, without either his gun or his hat, and his right hand and sleeve were observed to be stained with fresh blood. On following him they found the dead body stretched out upon the grass beside the pool. The head had been beaten in by repeated blows of some heavy and blunt weapon. The injuries were such as might very well have been inflicted by the butt-end of his son’s gun, which was found lying on the grass within a few paces of the body. Under these circumstances the young man was instantly arrested, and a verdict of ‘wilful murder’ having been returned at the inquest on Tuesday, he was on Wednesday brought before the magistrates at Ross, who have referred the case to the next Assizes. Those are the main facts of the case as they came out before the coroner and the police-court.”",
          "paraphrase_gemini-2.5-flash-preview-04-17": "“It is truly kind of you to join me, Watson,” he remarked. “It makes a significant difference to have someone I can fully depend on with me. Local assistance is always either useless or biased. If you will reserve the two seats by the window, I will purchase the tickets.” We had the train compartment entirely to ourselves, except for a huge pile of papers Holmes had brought. He sifted through these, reading, occasionally jotting down notes and pondering, until we had passed Reading. Then, he suddenly bundled them all into a vast sphere and threw it onto the overhead shelf. “Have you heard anything about the case?” he inquired. “Not a word. I haven't seen a newspaper in several days.” “The London newspapers haven't provided very detailed accounts. I’ve just gone through all the recent issues to get a grasp of the particulars. It seems, from what I’ve gathered, to be one of those straightforward cases that are exceedingly difficult.” “That sounds rather contradictory.” “But it is deeply true. Uniqueness is almost always a clue. The more unremarkable and ordinary a crime is, the harder it is to trace its perpetrator. In this instance, however, they have built a very strong case against the son of the murdered man.” “So, it is a murder?” “Well, it is presumed to be. I won't assume anything until I've had the chance to investigate personally. I will briefly explain the situation to you, as much as I have managed to understand it so far. “Boscombe Valley is a rural area not far from Ross, in Herefordshire. The largest landowner there is a Mr. John Turner, who made his fortune in Australia and returned to England some years ago. One of his leased farms, Hatherley, was occupied by Mr. Charles McCarthy, who was also formerly of Australia. They had known each other in the colonies, so it was understandable that they settled as close as possible upon returning. Turner was apparently the wealthier, so McCarthy became his tenant, yet they seemed to remain on terms of complete equality, frequently spending time together. McCarthy had an eighteen-year-old son, and Turner had an only daughter of the same age, but neither had living wives. They appeared to steer clear of the local English families and lived secluded lives, although both McCarthys enjoyed hunting and were often seen at nearby race meetings. McCarthy employed two servants—a man and a woman. Turner had a substantial household, at least half a dozen staff. That is the extent of what I have learned about the families. Now, for the events. “On June 3rd, which was last Monday, McCarthy left his house at Hatherley around three in the afternoon and walked to the Boscombe Pool, a small lake created by the widening of the stream flowing through Boscombe Valley. He had been in Ross with his manservant that morning and had instructed the servant he needed to hurry as he had an important appointment at three. He never returned alive from that appointment. “The distance from Hatherley Farmhouse to Boscombe Pool is a quarter of a mile, and two people saw him as he walked that path. One was an elderly woman, whose name is not recorded, and the other was William Crowder, a gamekeeper employed by Mr. Turner. Both witnesses testified that Mr. McCarthy was walking alone. The gamekeeper added that within minutes of seeing Mr. McCarthy pass, he had seen his son, Mr. James McCarthy, going the same way with a gun under his arm. To the best of his recollection, the father was still within sight at that time, and the son was following him. He didn't think further on the matter until he heard of the tragedy later that evening. “The two McCarthys were seen again after William Crowder, the gamekeeper, lost sight of them. Boscombe Pool is surrounded by dense woods, with just a narrow edge of grass and reeds. A girl of fourteen, Patience Moran, daughter of the lodge-keeper for the Boscombe Valley estate, was in one of the woods picking flowers. She reported that while there, she saw Mr. McCarthy and his son at the wood's edge, near the lake, and they seemed to be engaged in a fierce argument. She heard the elder Mr. McCarthy using very harsh language towards his son, and she saw the latter raise his hand as if to strike his father. Their aggression so frightened her that she ran away and, upon reaching home, told her mother she had left the two McCarthys quarrelling near Boscombe Pool and was afraid they were going to fight. She had barely finished speaking when young Mr. McCarthy came running to the lodge to say he had discovered his father dead in the wood and to ask the lodge-keeper for help. He was highly agitated, without his gun or hat, and his right hand and sleeve were noticed to be marked with fresh blood. Upon following him, they found the dead body lying on the grass next to the pool. The head had been severely injured by repeated blows from some heavy, blunt object. The wounds were such as could easily have been caused by the butt-end of his son's gun, which was found lying on the grass within a few steps of the body. Under these circumstances, the young man was immediately apprehended, and following a verdict of ‘wilful murder’ returned at the inquest on Tuesday, he was brought before the magistrates at Ross on Wednesday, who have sent the case to the next Assizes. Those are the primary facts of the case as they emerged during the coroner’s proceedings and in the police court.”",
          "paraphrase_gpt-4.1-2025-04-14": "\"Thank you very much for coming, Watson,\" Holmes said. \"It makes a big difference to have someone I can fully trust with me. The local help is either unreliable or biased. Please save us the two corner seats, and I’ll get the tickets.\"\n\nWe had the train compartment to ourselves, apart from the huge pile of papers Holmes had brought. He sifted through these, reading, making notes, and thinking, continuing this routine until we had passed Reading. Suddenly, he rolled up all the papers into a large bundle and put them on the luggage rack.\n\n\"Have you heard anything about the case?\" he asked.\n\n\"Nothing at all. I haven’t looked at a newspaper in several days.\"\n\n\"The London news hasn’t reported on it in detail. I’ve just gone through all the recent papers to get the details. From what I can tell, it is one of those apparently simple but actually very complex cases.\"\n\n\"That sounds contradictory.\"\n\n\"But it’s absolutely true. Unusual features almost always offer clues. The more ordinary and unremarkable a crime, the harder it is to solve. In this instance, however, there is a significant case against the murdered man’s son.\"\n\n\"So it is a murder?\"\n\n\"Well, that is the current suspicion. I won’t assume anything until I have looked into it myself. I’ll outline the situation as I understand it so far.\n\n\"Boscombe Valley is a rural area not far from Ross in Herefordshire. The biggest landowner there is Mr. John Turner, who made his fortune in Australia before returning to England several years ago. One of his farms, Hatherley, was rented to Mr. Charles McCarthy, also previously from Australia. The two men had known each other in Australia, so it made sense that they settled near each other in England. Turner was apparently wealthier, so McCarthy rented from him, though they remained equals and spent much time together. McCarthy had an eighteen-year-old son, and Turner had a daughter of the same age, but neither had a wife. They seemed to avoid the local English families and kept mostly to themselves, though the McCarthys enjoyed sports and often attended local races. McCarthy employed two servants—a man and a woman—while Turner had a larger household of at least six. That summarises what I’ve found out about the families. Now, the facts:\n\n\"On Monday, June 3rd, McCarthy left his home at Hatherley around 3 p.m. and walked to Boscombe Pool, a small lake formed by the widening of a stream running through the valley. He had gone into Ross with his servant that morning, telling him he needed to rush back for an important meeting at three. He never returned alive from that appointment.\n\n\"The distance from Hatherley Farm to Boscombe Pool is about a quarter mile. Two people saw him on the way: an unnamed elderly woman, and William Crowder, a gamekeeper employed by Mr. Turner. Both testified that McCarthy was walking alone. The gamekeeper also said he saw McCarthy’s son, James, following his father with a gun, and to his knowledge the son could see the father ahead. He didn’t think anything more of it until he learned later about the tragedy.\n\n\"Both McCarthys were seen after the gamekeeper lost sight of them. The area around Boscombe Pool is densely wooded, with grass and reeds at the edge. Patience Moran, the fourteen-year-old daughter of the lodge-keeper on the estate, was picking flowers in the woods. She reported seeing Mr. McCarthy and his son at the edge of the woods, close to the pool, engaged in a heated argument. She heard Mr. McCarthy senior shouting at his son, and saw the son raise his hand as if to strike him. Frightened, she ran home and told her mother that she had seen the two quarreling and feared they might fight. As she finished telling this, young Mr. McCarthy came running to the lodge claiming to have found his father dead in the woods and asking for help. He was extremely distressed, missing both his hat and his gun, and his right hand and sleeve were freshly bloodstained. Upon following him, the group found Mr. McCarthy’s body lying on the grass by the pool, his head battered with repeated blows from a heavy and blunt object. The wounds could have been inflicted with the butt of his son’s gun, which was found nearby on the grass. Under these circumstances, James McCarthy was immediately arrested. After an inquest declared it 'wilful murder' on Tuesday, he was brought before the magistrates at Ross on Wednesday, and the case was referred to the next Assizes. Those are the main facts as they emerged before the coroner and the police.\""

          "text_segment": "“I could hardly imagine a more damning case,” I remarked. “If ever circumstantial evidence pointed to a criminal it does so here.”\n“Circumstantial evidence is a very tricky thing,” answered Holmes thoughtfully. “It may seem to point very straight to one thing, but if you shift your own point of view a little, you may find it pointing in an equally uncompromising manner to something entirely different. It must be confessed, however, that the case looks exceedingly grave against the young man, and it is very possible that he is indeed the culprit. There are several people in the neighbourhood, however, and among them Miss Turner, the daughter of the neighbouring landowner, who believe in his innocence, and who have retained Lestrade, whom you may recollect in connection with the Study in Scarlet, to work out the case in his interest. Lestrade, being rather puzzled, has referred the case to me, and hence it is that two middle-aged gentlemen are flying westward at fifty miles an hour instead of quietly digesting their breakfasts at home.”\n“I am afraid,” said I, “that the facts are so obvious that you will find little credit to be gained out of this case.”\n“There is nothing more deceptive than an obvious fact,” he answered, laughing. “Besides, we may chance to hit upon some other obvious facts which may have been by no means obvious to Mr. Lestrade. You know me too well to think that I am boasting when I say that I shall either confirm or destroy his theory by means which he is quite incapable of employing, or even of understanding. To take the first example to hand, I very clearly perceive that in your bedroom the window is upon the right-hand side, and yet I question whether Mr. Lestrade would have noted even so self-evident a thing as that.”\n“How on earth—”\n“My dear fellow, I know you well. I know the military neatness which characterises you. You shave every morning, and in this season you shave by the sunlight; but since your shaving is less and less complete as we get farther back on the left side, until it becomes positively slovenly as we get round the angle of the jaw, it is surely very clear that that side is less illuminated than the other. I could not imagine a man of your habits looking at himself in an equal light and being satisfied with such a result. I only quote this as a trivial example of observation and inference. Therein lies my métier, and it is just possible that it may be of some service in the investigation which lies before us.",
          "paraphrase_gemini-2.5-flash-preview-04-17": "I commented that the case against the accused seemed overwhelmingly convincing, remarking that if ever indirect evidence pointed to a criminal, it certainly did so here. Holmes replied thoughtfully that circumstantial evidence is a very deceptive thing. He explained that while it might appear to point directly to one conclusion, changing one's perspective slightly can reveal it pointing with equal force to something entirely different. However, he conceded that the situation looked extremely serious for the young man, and it was quite possible he was indeed responsible. Yet, several individuals in the vicinity, including Miss Turner, the daughter of the nearby landowner, believe in his innocence. They have hired Lestrade, whom you may recall from 'A Study in Scarlet,' to investigate the case on his behalf. As Lestrade was rather puzzled, he brought the case to me, which is why two middle-aged gentlemen are currently traveling west at fifty miles per hour instead of leisurely eating breakfast at home. I expressed concern that the facts were so straightforward you would gain little recognition from this investigation. He laughed and responded that nothing is more misleading than a seemingly obvious fact. Besides, he added, we might stumble upon other apparent facts that Mr. Lestrade completely missed. You know me too well to think I am boasting when I say I will either confirm or disprove his theory using methods he is quite unable to employ or even understand. As a simple illustration, I can very clearly see that the window in your bedroom is on the right-hand side, yet I question whether Mr. Lestrade would have noticed even such a self-evident detail. 'How on earth did you know that—' I began. 'My dear fellow,' Holmes interjected, 'I know you very well. I recognize the military precision that defines you. You shave daily, and in this season, you use the sunlight for shaving; but because your shave becomes progressively less complete the farther back you go on the left side, becoming frankly untidy around the angle of the jaw, it is surely quite clear that side receives less light than the other. I cannot imagine a man with your habits looking at himself in equal light and being satisfied with such a result. I only offer this as a trivial example of observation and inference. That is my expertise, and it is just possible that it may be of some use in the investigation that lies before us.'",
          "paraphrase_gpt-4.1-2025-04-14": "“This looks like a thoroughly incriminating situation,” I commented. “If circumstantial evidence ever indicated someone’s guilt, it certainly does in this case.”\n\n“Circumstantial evidence can be quite misleading,” Holmes replied thoughtfully. “It may appear to straightforwardly indicate one conclusion, but if you change your perspective a bit, it might lead just as strongly to an entirely different one. Still, I admit things look very bad for the young man, and he could well be guilty. But there are others in the area—such as Miss Turner, the daughter of a neighboring landowner—who are convinced of his innocence. They have hired Lestrade—whom you might remember from the Study in Scarlet—to pursue the case on his behalf. Since Lestrade is rather baffled, he has called me in, which is why we two middle-aged gentlemen are speeding west at fifty miles per hour instead of enjoying our breakfasts at home.”\n\n“I’m concerned,” I said, “that the facts are so clear you won’t get much credit from this case.”\n\n“There’s nothing more misleading than a supposedly obvious fact,” Holmes responded with a laugh. “Besides, we might uncover other ‘obvious’ details that Lestrade may have completely missed. You know me well enough to realize that I’m not boasting when I say I will either confirm or refute his theory using methods he cannot apply or even imagine. Take for instance: I can plainly see that the window in your bedroom is to the right. Yet I doubt Lestrade would have noticed such an apparent detail.”\n\n“How did you deduce that?”\n\n“My dear friend, I know your habits. Your trademark military precision is evident. You shave every morning, and in this season you use sunlight. But as you go further back on your left cheek, your shave gets less thorough and even sloppy at the jaw’s angle, which suggests that side is less well-lit. A man as precise as you wouldn’t accept such a result if both sides were equally illuminated. I’m only offering this as a simple illustration of observation and deduction. That is my specialty, and it could be useful in the case that lies ahead.”"

          "text_segment": "There are one or two minor points which were brought out in the inquest, and which are worth considering.”\n“What are they?”\n“It appears that his arrest did not take place at once, but after the return to Hatherley Farm. On the inspector of constabulary informing him that he was a prisoner, he remarked that he was not surprised to hear it, and that it was no more than his deserts. This observation of his had the natural effect of removing any traces of doubt which might have remained in the minds of the coroner’s jury.”\n“It was a confession,” I ejaculated.\n“No, for it was followed by a protestation of innocence.”\n“Coming on the top of such a damning series of events, it was at least a most suspicious remark.”\n“On the contrary,” said Holmes, “it is the brightest rift which I can at present see in the clouds. However innocent he might be, he could not be such an absolute imbecile as not to see that the circumstances were very black against him. Had he appeared surprised at his own arrest, or feigned indignation at it, I should have looked upon it as highly suspicious, because such surprise or anger would not be natural under the circumstances, and yet might appear to be the best policy to a scheming man. His frank acceptance of the situation marks him as either an innocent man, or else as a man of considerable self-restraint and firmness. As to his remark about his deserts, it was also not unnatural if you consider that he stood beside the dead body of his father, and that there is no doubt that he had that very day so far forgotten his filial duty as to bandy words with him, and even, according to the little girl whose evidence is so important, to raise his hand as if to strike him. The self-reproach and contrition which are displayed in his remark appear to me to be the signs of a healthy mind rather than of a guilty one.”\nI shook my head. “Many men have been hanged on far slighter evidence,” I remarked.\n“So they have. And many men have been wrongfully hanged.”\n“What is the young man’s own account of the matter?”\n“It is, I am afraid, not very encouraging to his supporters, though there are one or two points in it which are suggestive. You will find it here, and may read it for yourself.”\nHe picked out from his bundle a copy of the local Herefordshire paper, and having turned down the sheet he pointed out the paragraph in which the unfortunate young man had given his own statement of what had occurred. I settled myself down in the corner of the carriage and read it very carefully. It ran in this way:\n“Mr. James McCarthy, the only son of the deceased, was then called and gave evidence as follows: ‘I had been away from home for three days at Bristol, and had only just returned upon the morning of last Monday, the 3rd. My father was absent from home at the time of my arrival, and I was informed by the maid that he had driven over to Ross with John Cobb, the groom. Shortly after my return I heard the wheels of his trap in the yard, and, looking out of my window, I saw him get out and walk rapidly out of the yard, though I was not aware in which direction he was going. I then took my gun and strolled out in the direction of the Boscombe Pool, with the intention of visiting the rabbit warren which is upon the other side. On my way I saw William Crowder, the game-keeper, as he had stated in his evidence; but he is mistaken in thinking that I was following my father. I had no idea that he was in front of me. When about a hundred yards from the pool I heard a cry of “Cooee!” which was a usual signal between my father and myself. I then hurried forward, and found him standing by the pool. He appeared to be much surprised at seeing me and asked me rather roughly what I was doing there. A conversation ensued which led to high words and almost to blows, for my father was a man of a very violent temper. Seeing that his passion was becoming ungovernable, I left him and returned towards Hatherley Farm. I had not gone more than 150 yards, however, when I heard a hideous outcry behind me, which caused me to run back again. I found my father expiring upon the ground, with his head terribly injured. I dropped my gun and held him in my arms, but he almost instantly expired. I knelt beside him for some minutes, and then made my way to Mr. Turner’s lodge-keeper, his house being the nearest, to ask for assistance. I saw no one near my father when I returned, and I have no idea how he came by his injuries. He was not a popular man, being somewhat cold and forbidding in his manners, but he had, as far as I know, no active enemies. I know nothing further of the matter.’\n“The Coroner: Did your father make any statement to you before he died?\n“Witness: He mumbled a few words, but I could only catch some allusion to a rat.\n“The Coroner: What did you understand by that?\n“Witness: It conveyed no meaning to me. I thought that he was delirious.\n“The Coroner: What was the point upon which you and your father had this final quarrel?\n“Witness: I should prefer not to answer.\n“The Coroner: I am afraid that I must press it.\n“Witness: It is really impossible for me to tell you. I can assure you that it has nothing to do with the sad tragedy which followed.\n“The Coroner: That is for the court to decide. I need not point out to you that your refusal to answer will prejudice your case considerably in any future proceedings which may arise.\n“Witness: I must still refuse.\n“The Coroner: I understand that the cry of ‘Cooee’ was a common signal between you and your father?\n“Witness: It was.\n“The Coroner: How was it, then, that he uttered it before he saw you, and before he even knew that you had returned from Bristol?\n“Witness (with considerable confusion): I do not know.\n“A Juryman: Did you see nothing which aroused your suspicions when you returned on hearing the cry and found your father fatally injured?\n“Witness: Nothing definite.\n“The Coroner: What do you mean?\n“Witness: I was so disturbed and excited as I rushed out into the open, that I could think of nothing except of my father. Yet I have a vague impression that as I ran forward something lay upon the ground to the left of me. It seemed to me to be something grey in colour, a coat of some sort, or a plaid perhaps. When I rose from my father I looked round for it, but it was gone.\n“‘Do you mean that it disappeared before you went for help?’\n“‘Yes, it was gone.’\n“ ‘You cannot say what it was?’\n“‘No, I had a feeling something was there.’\n“‘How far from the body?’\n“‘A dozen yards or so.’\n“‘And how far from the edge of the wood?’\n“‘About the same.’\n“‘Then if it was removed it was while you were within a dozen yards of it?’\n“‘Yes, but with my back towards it.’\n“This concluded the examination of the witness.”\n“I see,” said I as I glanced down the column, “that the coroner in his concluding remarks was rather severe upon young McCarthy. He calls attention, and with reason, to the discrepancy about his father having signalled to him before seeing him, also to his refusal to give details of his conversation with his father, and his singular account of his father’s dying words. They are all, as he remarks, very much against the son.”\nHolmes laughed softly to himself and stretched himself out upon the cushioned seat. “Both you and the coroner have been at some pains,” said he, “to single out the very strongest points in the young man’s favour. Don’t you see that you alternately give him credit for having too much imagination and too little? Too little, if he could not invent a cause of quarrel which would give him the sympathy of the jury; too much, if he evolved from his own inner consciousness anything so outré as a dying reference to a rat, and the incident of the vanishing cloth. No, sir, I shall approach this case from the point of view that what this young man says is true, and we shall see whither that hypothesis will lead us. And now here is my pocket Petrarch, and not another word shall I say of this case until we are on the scene of action. We lunch at Swindon, and I see that we shall be there in twenty minutes.”",
          "paraphrase_gemini-2.5-flash-preview-04-17": "Sherlock Holmes highlighted a couple of minor details from the inquest worth examining. I inquired what they were. He explained that James McCarthy was not arrested immediately but later, back at Hatherley Farm. When the inspector informed him he was under arrest, James replied that he wasn't surprised and felt he deserved it. This comment naturally removed any lingering doubts the jury might have had. I exclaimed that sounded like a confession. Holmes countered that it was followed by a claim of innocence. I argued that given the damning circumstances, it was highly suspicious. Holmes disagreed, calling it the most hopeful sign he saw. He reasoned that however innocent, James couldn't be so dim as not to realize the evidence was stacked against him. Had he shown surprise or feigned anger at the arrest, Holmes would have found that suspicious, as such reactions would be unnatural but might seem like a clever tactic. His straightforward acceptance, Holmes felt, indicated either innocence or significant self-control and resolve. Regarding his comment about deserving it, Holmes found it understandable considering he was standing beside his deceased father's body, knowing he had quarrelled with him earlier that day and, according to the crucial testimony of the little girl, had even raised his hand as if to hit him. The apparent self-reproach and regret shown in his remark, Holmes believed, suggested a healthy conscience rather than a guilty one. I shook my head, noting that many men had been hanged on much less evidence. Holmes agreed, adding that many had been wrongly hanged. I asked for the young man's own version of events. Holmes replied that it wasn't very encouraging for his supporters, but did contain a few suggestive points. He offered a copy of the local Herefordshire newspaper from his bundle, indicating the paragraph where the unfortunate young man's statement was printed. I settled into the corner of the carriage and read it carefully. The account stated that Mr. James McCarthy, the victim's only son, testified that he had been in Bristol for three days, returning that Monday morning, the 3rd. His father wasn't home upon his arrival, and the maid said he had gone to Ross with John Cobb, the groom. Soon after, he heard his father's carriage returning and, looking from his window, saw him alight and leave the yard rapidly, although he didn't know his destination. He then took his gun and walked towards the Boscombe Pool, intending to visit the rabbit warren on the other side. On his way, he saw William Crowder, the gamekeeper, as Crowder had stated in his evidence, but denied following his father, saying he didn't know his father was ahead. About a hundred yards from the pool, he heard a cry of “Cooee!”, which was their usual signal. He hurried forward and found his father by the pool. His father seemed very surprised to see him and asked quite roughly what he was doing there. A disagreement followed, leading to angry words and almost physical confrontation, as his father was very hot-tempered. Seeing his father becoming uncontrollably angry, he left him and headed back towards Hatherley Farm. However, after going about 150 yards, he heard a terrible outcry from behind and ran back. He found his father dying on the ground with severe head injuries. He dropped his gun, held his father, but he died almost instantly. He knelt beside him for several minutes before going to Mr. Turner’s lodge-keeper, whose house was the nearest, to get help. He saw no one near his father when he returned and had no idea how he was injured. He described his father as unpopular, somewhat cold and uninviting, but stated he knew of no active enemies. He concluded by saying he knew nothing more about the matter. The Coroner asked if his father said anything before he died. James replied he mumbled a few words, but he only caught a reference to a rat. The Coroner asked what he understood by that. James said it made no sense and he thought his father was delirious. The Coroner asked about the topic of their final quarrel. James said he preferred not to answer. The Coroner insisted he must. James repeated that he truly couldn't tell him but assured it was unrelated to the tragedy. The Coroner stated that was for the court to decide and warned that his refusal would significantly prejudice his case in future proceedings. James still refused. The Coroner confirmed that the “Cooee” cry was a common signal between them. James agreed. The Coroner then asked how his father could have uttered it before seeing him or knowing he had returned from Bristol. James responded with obvious confusion that he didn't know. A Juryman asked if he saw anything suspicious when he returned upon hearing the cry and found his father fatally injured. James replied, “Nothing definite.” The Coroner asked what he meant. James explained that he was too distressed and agitated rushing out into the open to think of anything but his father. However, he had a vague memory that as he ran forward, something grey, perhaps a coat or plaid, lay on the ground to his left, about a dozen yards away and similarly far from the wood's edge. When he got up from his father, he looked for it, but it was gone. Asked if it disappeared before he went for help, he confirmed it was gone. He couldn't describe it, just had a feeling something was there. Asked how far from the body, he said about a dozen yards. Asked how far from the wood edge, about the same. The Coroner inferred that if it was removed, it happened while he was within a dozen yards of it. James agreed, but noted his back was turned. The newspaper account concluded with the end of James's testimony. As I looked down the column, I remarked that the coroner’s concluding remarks were quite critical of young McCarthy. I pointed out that the coroner justly highlighted the inconsistencies: his father signalling before seeing him, his refusal to detail the quarrel, and his odd report of his father’s dying words. As the coroner noted, all these points significantly weighed against the son. Holmes chuckled softly and stretched out on the cushioned seat. He commented that both I and the coroner had taken pains to identify the very points that were most favourable to the young man. He asked if I didn't see that we were alternately giving him credit for having too much imagination and too little. Too little, if he couldn't invent a reason for the quarrel that would earn jury sympathy; too much, if he conjured up something from his imagination as strange as a dying reference to a rat and the incident of the vanishing cloth. Holmes declared he would approach the case by assuming the young man's statement was true and see where that premise led. He then took out his pocket Petrarch, stating he wouldn't discuss the case further until they reached the location. He mentioned they would have lunch at Swindon and would arrive in twenty minutes.",
          "paraphrase_gpt-4.1-2025-04-14": "There are a few small details that came up during the inquest that deserve our attention,\" Holmes began.\n\n\"What are those?\" I asked.\n\nHe explained, \"He wasn't arrested right away; it happened only after he returned to Hatherley Farm. When the police inspector told him he was under arrest, he said he wasn't surprised and that he deserved it. That comment made any lingering doubts among the jurors disappear.\"\n\n\"So it was basically a confession,\" I said.\n\nHolmes disagreed. \"No, because he then insisted he was innocent.\"\n\n\"Still, given all the incriminating events, it's quite a suspicious thing to say.\"\n\n\"Actually,\" Holmes replied, \"it's the main positive sign I see so far. Even if he were innocent, he couldn't be so foolish as to think things didn’t look bleak for him. If he had acted shocked at his arrest or pretended to be outraged, that would have seemed even more suspicious to me, since faked surprise or anger wouldn’t be natural—they would look calculated. That he candidly accepted the situation suggests either he's innocent or he's exceptionally self-controlled. As for his comment about deserving it, that's also not so odd—he was standing over his father’s corpse, and it's clear he had quarreled with him that same day, even threatening him, according to the young girl's important testimony. The guilt and regret apparent in his words seem more like the sign of a conscience-stricken mind than a guilty one.\"\n\nI shook my head. \"People have been executed for far less.\"\n\n\"That's true,\" agreed Holmes. \"And many innocent people have also been executed.\"\n\n\"What is the young man's version of events?\"\n\nHolmes answered, \"It's not especially helpful for his defense, though there are one or two potentially meaningful details. You can read his statement here in the local Herefordshire newspaper.\" He handed me the column, indicating the pertinent section. I settled in and read:\n\n\"Mr. James McCarthy, the deceased's only son, testified: 'I’d been away for three days in Bristol and just returned on Monday, the 3rd. When I got home, my father was out— the maid said he'd gone to Ross with John Cobb, the groom. Soon after, I heard his carriage return in the yard, and looked out to see him get out and leave quickly, though I didn’t see which way he went. I then took my gun and headed towards Boscombe Pool, wanting to visit the rabbit warren on the far side. On the way, as mentioned by William Crowder the gamekeeper, I saw him, but contrary to his claims, I was not following my father—I didn’t even know he was ahead of me. When I was about a hundred yards from the pool, I heard someone call \"Cooee!\"—a signal my father and I often used. I hurried over and found him by the pool. He seemed agitated at my arrival and asked roughly why I was there. We began to argue, almost to the point of violence—my father had a very bad temper. Seeing his anger was getting out of hand, I left and started back towards Hatherley Farm. I’d gone about 150 yards when I heard a terrible outcry behind me, so I ran back. My father was on the ground, gravely wounded. I dropped my gun and tried to help him, but he died almost immediately. After kneeling by him for several minutes, I went to Mr. Turner’s lodge to get help. I didn’t see anyone else around on my return and don’t know how he was hurt. My father wasn't a popular man, but had no known enemies. That’s all I know.'\n\n\"Coroner: Did your father say anything before he died?\nWitness: He mumbled something about a rat, but I couldn’t make sense of it.\nCoroner: What did you think he meant?\nWitness: I thought he was delirious; it made no sense to me.\nCoroner: What exactly was your quarrel with your father about?\nWitness: I’d rather not say.\nCoroner: I'm afraid you must.\nWitness: I truly can’t tell you, but it has nothing to do with what happened afterwards.\nCoroner: The court will determine that, but I warn you that refusing to answer may hurt your case.\nWitness: I must still decline.\nCoroner: The call of ‘Cooee’ was used routinely between you and your father?\nWitness: Yes, it was.\nCoroner: Then how did your father use it before he saw you or knew you were home?\nWitness (nervously): I don't know.\nJuryman: Did you see anything suspicious after you heard the cry and found your father wounded?\nWitness: Nothing definite.\nCoroner: What do you mean?\nWitness: I was so shocked that I saw nothing but my father—though I hazily recall seeing something gray, like a coat or plaid, off to my left as I ran. When I looked after helping my father, it was gone.\nCoroner: Do you mean it disappeared before you left to get help?\nWitness: Yes.\nCoroner: You can't say what it was?\nWitness: No, just that I had a sense something was there.\nCoroner: How far from the body?\nWitness: About a dozen yards.\nCoroner: How far from the edge of the woods?\nWitness: Roughly the same.\nCoroner: So if it was removed, it happened while you were still close but with your back turned?\nWitness: Yes.\n\nThat ended the testimony.\" I continued, \"I see from the coroner’s comments at the end that he was pretty harsh on young McCarthy, highlighting inconsistencies—like his father calling him before seeing him, his refusal to explain their quarrel, and his odd retelling of his father's dying words. The coroner says these all count against the son.\"\n\nHolmes chuckled lightly and stretched out on his seat. \"You and the coroner have worked hard,\" he said, \"to point out what seem like the strongest arguments against the young man—but don't you see, you alternately accuse him of too much imagination or not enough? Too little, if he can't invent a plausible fight to win sympathy from the jury; too much, if he invents bizarre things like his father's talk of a rat or the missing cloth. I intend to take his story as truth and see where that line of thought leads us. Now, let's have no more about this case until we’re actually on the scene. We’ll lunch at Swindon—only twenty minutes away.\""

          "text_segment": "It was nearly four o’clock when we at last, after passing through the beautiful Stroud Valley, and over the broad gleaming Severn, found ourselves at the pretty little country-town of Ross. A lean, ferret-like man, furtive and sly-looking, was waiting for us upon the platform. In spite of the light brown dustcoat and leather-leggings which he wore in deference to his rustic surroundings, I had no difficulty in recognising Lestrade, of Scotland Yard. With him we drove to the Hereford Arms where a room had already been engaged for us.\n“I have ordered a carriage,” said Lestrade as we sat over a cup of tea. “I knew your energetic nature, and that you would not be happy until you had been on the scene of the crime.”\n“It was very nice and complimentary of you,” Holmes answered. “It is entirely a question of barometric pressure.”\nLestrade looked startled. “I do not quite follow,” he said.\n“How is the glass? Twenty-nine, I see. No wind, and not a cloud in the sky. I have a caseful of cigarettes here which need smoking, and the sofa is very much superior to the usual country hotel abomination. I do not think that it is probable that I shall use the carriage to-night.”\nLestrade laughed indulgently. “You have, no doubt, already formed your conclusions from the newspapers,” he said. “The case is as plain as a pikestaff, and the more one goes into it the plainer it becomes. Still, of course, one can’t refuse a lady, and such a very positive one, too. She has heard of you, and would have your opinion, though I repeatedly told her that there was nothing which you could do which I had not already done. Why, bless my soul! here is her carriage at the door.”\nHe had hardly spoken before there rushed into the room one of the most lovely young women that I have ever seen in my life. Her violet eyes shining, her lips parted, a pink flush upon her cheeks, all thought of her natural reserve lost in her overpowering excitement and concern.\n“Oh, Mr. Sherlock Holmes!” she cried, glancing from one to the other of us, and finally, with a woman’s quick intuition, fastening upon my companion, “I am so glad that you have come. I have driven down to tell you so. I know that James didn’t do it. I know it, and I want you to start upon your work knowing it, too. Never let yourself doubt upon that point. We have known each other since we were little children, and I know his faults as no one else does; but he is too tender-hearted to hurt a fly. Such a charge is absurd to anyone who really knows him.”\n“I hope we may clear him, Miss Turner,” said Sherlock Holmes. “You may rely upon my doing all that I can.”\n“But you have read the evidence. You have formed some conclusion? Do you not see some loophole, some flaw? Do you not yourself think that he is innocent?”\n“I think that it is very probable.”\n“There, now!” she cried, throwing back her head and looking defiantly at Lestrade. “You hear! He gives me hopes.”\nLestrade shrugged his shoulders. “I am afraid that my colleague has been a little quick in forming his conclusions,” he said.\n“But he is right. Oh! I know that he is right. James never did it. And about his quarrel with his father, I am sure that the reason why he would not speak about it to the coroner was because I was concerned in it.”\n“In what way?” asked Holmes.\n“It is no time for me to hide anything. James and his father had many disagreements about me. Mr. McCarthy was very anxious that there should be a marriage between us. James and I have always loved each other as brother and sister; but of course he is young and has seen very little of life yet, and—and—well, he naturally did not wish to do anything like that yet. So there were quarrels, and this, I am sure, was one of them.”\n“And your father?” asked Holmes. “Was he in favour of such a union?”\n“No, he was averse to it also. No one but Mr. McCarthy was in favour of it.” A quick blush passed over her fresh young face as Holmes shot one of his keen, questioning glances at her.\n“Thank you for this information,” said he. “May I see your father if I call to-morrow?”\n“I am afraid the doctor won’t allow it.”\n“The doctor?”\n“Yes, have you not heard? Poor father has never been strong for years back, but this has broken him down completely. He has taken to his bed, and Dr. Willows says that he is a wreck and that his nervous system is shattered. Mr. McCarthy was the only man alive who had known dad in the old days in Victoria.”\n“Ha! In Victoria! That is important.”\n“Yes, at the mines.”\n“Quite so; at the gold-mines, where, as I understand, Mr. Turner made his money.”\n“Yes, certainly.”\n“Thank you, Miss Turner. You have been of material assistance to me.”\n“You will tell me if you have any news to-morrow. No doubt you will go to the prison to see James. Oh, if you do, Mr. Holmes, do tell him that I know him to be innocent.”\n“I will, Miss Turner.”\n“I must go home now, for dad is very ill, and he misses me so if I leave him. Good-bye, and God help you in your undertaking.” She hurried from the room as impulsively as she had entered, and we heard the wheels of her carriage rattle off down the street.",
          "paraphrase_gemini-2.5-flash-preview-04-17": "Around four o'clock, having traveled through the picturesque Stroud Valley and across the wide, shining Severn River, we arrived in the pleasant small town of Ross. A slender man, resembling a ferret, with a secretive and cunning look, was waiting for us on the platform. Despite wearing a light brown dustcoat and leather leggings suitable for the countryside, I easily recognized Lestrade from Scotland Yard. We drove with him to the Hereford Arms hotel, where a room had already been booked for us. While we had tea, Lestrade said, \"I've ordered a carriage. Knowing how energetic you are, I figured you'd want to go straight to the crime scene.\" Holmes replied, \"That was thoughtful and kind of you, but my inclination depends entirely on the barometric pressure.\" Lestrade appeared surprised. \"I don't quite understand,\" he admitted. Holmes gestured towards the window. \"What's the reading? Twenty-nine, I see. No wind, clear sky. I have a box of cigarettes that need smoking, and this sofa is far better than the typical awful country hotel furniture. I doubt I'll be needing that carriage tonight.\" Lestrade chuckled indulgently. \"You've probably already formed your opinions from the newspapers,\" he said. \"The case is incredibly clear, and the more you look at it, the simpler it gets. Still, you can't refuse a lady, especially such a determined one. She's heard of you and wants your opinion, even though I've repeatedly told her there's nothing more you could do than I already have. Good heavens, here's her carriage now!\" No sooner had he spoken than one of the most beautiful young women I had ever seen burst into the room. Her violet eyes gleamed, her lips were slightly parted, and a pink blush was on her cheeks; her usual shyness was overcome by intense excitement and worry. \"Oh, Mr. Sherlock Holmes!\" she cried, looking quickly between us before her woman's sharp instinct fixed on Holmes, \"I am so relieved you've come. I drove down just to tell you. I know James didn't do it. I'm certain of it, and I want you to begin your investigation knowing that too. Never doubt that point. We've known each other since childhood, and I know his faults better than anyone, but he's too gentle to hurt a fly. The accusation is ridiculous to anyone who truly knows him.\" \"I hope we can clear his name, Miss Turner,\" said Sherlock Holmes. \"You can be sure I will do everything possible.\" \"But you've read the evidence. You must have reached a conclusion? Don't you see a way out, a flaw? Don't you believe he is innocent yourself?\" \"I think it is very likely.\" \"See!\" she exclaimed, tilting her head back and looking defiantly at Lestrade. \"You hear that! He gives me hope.\" Lestrade shrugged. \"I'm afraid my colleague might have been a little hasty in his judgment,\" he commented. \"But he's right! Oh, I know he's right. James never did it. And concerning his argument with his father, I'm sure the reason he wouldn't discuss it with the coroner was because I was involved.\" \"How so?\" Holmes asked. \"This isn't the time for secrets. James and his father frequently argued about me. Mr. McCarthy was very keen for us to marry. James and I have always cared for each other like siblings; but he's young, hasn't seen much of the world yet, and... well, naturally, he wasn't ready for something like that. So there were arguments, and I am certain this was one of them.\" \"And your father?\" Holmes inquired. \"Was he in favor of such a marriage?\" \"No, he was also against it. Only Mr. McCarthy wanted it.\" A quick flush spread across her fresh young face as Holmes gave her one of his sharp, probing looks. \"Thank you for this information,\" he said. \"Might I visit your father tomorrow?\" \"I'm afraid the doctor won't permit it.\" \"The doctor?\" \"Yes, hadn't you heard? Poor father hasn't been strong for years, but this has completely broken him. He's confined to bed, and Dr. Willows says he's completely wrecked and his nervous system is shattered. Mr. McCarthy was the only living person who knew Dad from the old days in Victoria.\" \"Ah! In Victoria! That's significant.\" \"Yes, at the mines.\" \"Precisely; at the gold mines, where, as I understand, Mr. Turner made his fortune.\" \"Yes, that's right.\" \"Thank you, Miss Turner. You have been very helpful to me.\" \"Please tell me if you have any news tomorrow. You'll probably go to the prison to see James. Oh, if you do, Mr. Holmes, please tell him I know he is innocent.\" \"I will, Miss Turner.\" \"I must return home now; Dad is very ill, and he misses me so much if I'm away. Good-bye, and may God assist you in your task.\" She left the room as quickly as she had arrived, and we heard the sound of her carriage driving away down the street.",

Waiting for us on the platform was a thin, sharp-eyed man with a sly appearance. Despite his country-style dustcoat and leather leggings, I easily recognized him as Lestrade from Scotland Yard. We went with him to the Hereford Arms, where our room had already been booked. As we enjoyed some tea, Lestrade mentioned he had arranged for a carriage, knowing I would be eager to get to the crime scene promptly. Holmes responded with amusement, suggesting that, given the good weather and comfortable room, he doubted he would use the carriage that evening. Lestrade remarked that Holmes must already have drawn conclusions from newspaper accounts, asserting that the case seemed very straightforward, but he couldn’t refuse the insistent request of a lady who wanted Holmes’s opinion. Just then, a beautiful, visibly excited young woman entered—Miss Turner. She immediately expressed her relief at seeing Holmes and insisted on James's innocence, pleading with Holmes not to doubt him for a moment. Holmes assured her of his efforts, and when she pressed him for his opinion, he agreed that James was likely innocent. Buoyed by this, she challenged Lestrade, who cautioned that Holmes might be premature in his judgment. Miss Turner explained that she figured in the disagreements between James and his father, as Mr. McCarthy wished for James to marry her—a wish neither she nor her own father supported. Holmes asked if he could see her father the next day, but she told him her father was too ill. Holmes learned that Mr. McCarthy and her father had known each other from their time at the gold mines in Victoria, which he found significant. Grateful, Miss Turner asked Holmes to notify James of her faith in his innocence before hurrying home due to her father's poor health. We heard her carriage depart as she left."

No, it was more likely to be an attempt to explain how he met his fate. But what could it indicate? I cudgelled my brains to find some possible explanation. And then the incident of the grey cloth seen by young McCarthy. If that were true the murderer must have dropped some part of his dress, presumably his overcoat, in his flight, and must have had the hardihood to return and to carry it away at the instant when the son was kneeling with his back turned not a dozen paces off. What a tissue of mysteries and improbabilities the whole thing was!

No, it was more likely to be an attempt to explain how he met his fate. But what could it indicate? I cudgelled my brains to find some possible explanation. And then the incident of the grey cloth seen by young McCarthy. If that were true the murderer must have dropped some part of his dress, presumably his overcoat, in his flight, and must have had the hardihood to return and to carry it away at the instant when the son was kneeling with his back turned not a dozen paces off. What a tissue of mysteries and improbabilities the whole thing was! I did not wonder at Lestrade’s opinion, and yet I had so much faith in Sherlock Holmes’ insight that I could not lose hope as long as every fresh fact seemed to strengthen his conviction of young McCarthy’s innocence.",
          "paraphrase_gpt-4.1-2025-04-14": "Lestrade spoke to Holmes, expressing his disapproval and suggesting that Holmes was giving false hope only to end in disappointment, considering it a cruel thing to do. Holmes, however, responded that he believed he could clear James McCarthy’s name and asked if they could visit him in prison. Lestrade replied that they could, but only he and Holmes were authorized. Holmes then decided to go and suggested there was still enough time that evening to catch a train to Hereford to see McCarthy. Watson agreed to accompany them to the station but then wandered around town before returning to the hotel, where he tried to distract himself with a novel but found it lacking compared to the real mystery. His mind kept returning to the case, especially the puzzle of what could have happened to James McCarthy’s father between their parting and the fatal moment. He wondered if the nature of the wounds would provide any clues, so he consulted the local newspaper’s account of the inquest. According to the surgeon, the left rear of the skull had been struck hard from behind with a blunt weapon. Watson observed that this detail could support the son’s innocence since he and his father had been arguing face to face, although it was possible the father turned away before being hit. He considered telling Holmes about this. Watson also pondered the meaning of the dying reference to a rat—surely not delirium, but perhaps a clue to his fate. He puzzled over the reported sighting of a piece of grey cloth, speculating that if the killer had dropped his coat and then retrieved it as the son’s back was turned, it would show boldness. The whole situation was full of strange mysteries and improbabilities. Watson sympathized with Lestrade’s skepticism, but his trust in Holmes’s abilities kept his hope alive as more evidence seemed to support McCarthy’s innocence."

          "text_segment": "It was late before Sherlock Holmes returned. He came back alone, for Lestrade was staying in lodgings in the town.\n“The glass still keeps very high,” he remarked as he sat down. “It is of importance that it should not rain before we are able to go over the ground. On the other hand, a man should be at his very best and keenest for such nice work as that, and I did not wish to do it when fagged by a long journey. I have seen young McCarthy.”\n“And what did you learn from him?”\n“Nothing.”\n“Could he throw no light?”\n“None at all. I was inclined to think at one time that he knew who had done it and was screening him or her, but I am convinced now that he is as puzzled as everyone else. He is not a very quick-witted youth, though comely to look at and, I should think, sound at heart.”\n“I cannot admire his taste,” I remarked, “if it is indeed a fact that he was averse to a marriage with so charming a young lady as this Miss Turner.”\n“Ah, thereby hangs a rather painful tale. This fellow is madly, insanely, in love with her, but some two years ago, when he was only a lad, and before he really knew her, for she had been away five years at a boarding-school, what does the idiot do but get into the clutches of a barmaid in Bristol and marry her at a registry office? No one knows a word of the matter, but you can imagine how maddening it must be to him to be upbraided for not doing what he would give his very eyes to do, but what he knows to be absolutely impossible. It was sheer frenzy of this sort which made him throw his hands up into the air when his father, at their last interview, was goading him on to propose to Miss Turner. On the other hand, he had no means of supporting himself, and his father, who was by all accounts a very hard man, would have thrown him over utterly had he known the truth. It was with his barmaid wife that he had spent the last three days in Bristol, and his father did not know where he was. Mark that point. It is of importance. Good has come out of evil, however, for the barmaid, finding from the papers that he is in serious trouble and likely to be hanged, has thrown him over utterly and has written to him to say that she has a husband already in the Bermuda Dockyard, so that there is really no tie between them. I think that that bit of news has consoled young McCarthy for all that he has suffered.”\n“But if he is innocent, who has done it?”\n“Ah! who? I would call your attention very particularly to two points. One is that the murdered man had an appointment with someone at the pool, and that the someone could not have been his son, for his son was away, and he did not know when he would return. The second is that the murdered man was heard to cry ‘Cooee!’ before he knew that his son had returned. Those are the crucial points upon which the case depends. And now let us talk about George Meredith, if you please, and we shall leave all minor matters until to-morrow.”",
          "paraphrase_gemini-2.5-flash-preview-04-17": "It was late when Sherlock Holmes came back, and he was by himself since Lestrade was staying in a rented room in town. “The barometer is still reading very high,” he noted as he took a seat. “It’s crucial that it doesn’t rain before we can examine the area thoroughly. On the other hand, a person needs to be at their peak and completely focused for such precise work, and I didn’t want to attempt it while exhausted from a long trip. I’ve met with young McCarthy.” “And what information did you get from him?” “Nothing.” “He couldn't provide any clarity?” “Absolutely none. At one point, I suspected he might know who committed the act and was covering for them, but I am now convinced he is just as bewildered as everyone else. He isn't particularly sharp-witted, although he is handsome and seems to be fundamentally decent.” “I can’t say I admire his judgment,” I commented, “if it's true that he was unwilling to marry such a delightful young woman as Miss Turner.” “Ah, that involves a rather sad story. This young man is intensely, madly, in love with her, but about two years ago, when he was just a boy, and before he really knew her, as she had been away at boarding school for five years, the fool went and got involved with a barmaid in Bristol and married her at a government office. Not a soul knows about it, but you can imagine how infuriating it must be for him to be criticized for not doing the very thing he would give anything to do, but which he knows is utterly impossible. It was this sheer desperation that caused him to throw his hands up when his father, during their final conversation, was pressuring him to propose to Miss Turner. Moreover, he had no way to support himself financially, and his father, widely considered a very harsh man, would have completely cut him off had he known the truth. He had spent the previous three days in Bristol with his barmaid wife, and his father was unaware of his whereabouts. Note that point; it's significant. However, something positive has emerged from the unfortunate situation, as the barmaid, upon reading in the newspapers that he is in serious trouble and possibly facing hanging, has completely abandoned him and written to say she already has a husband working in the Bermuda Dockyard, meaning there is effectively no bond between them. I believe that piece of news has consoled young McCarthy for everything he has endured.” “But if he is innocent, then who committed the murder?” “Ah! Who indeed? I want to draw your very particular attention to two facts. One is that the victim had an arrangement to meet someone at the pool, and that person could not have been his son, because his son was away and his return time was unknown. The second is that the victim was heard to shout ‘Cooee!’ before he could have known his son had returned. These are the critical elements upon which the case rests. And now, if you please, let us talk about George Meredith, and we will put off all less important matters until tomorrow.”",
          "paraphrase_gpt-4.1-2025-04-14": "Sherlock Holmes arrived back late at night, having returned alone since Lestrade was staying elsewhere in town. As he sat down, Holmes commented that the barometer remained high, emphasizing the importance of dry weather before they could examine the scene. He added he wanted to be rested for such detailed work and not exhausted from traveling. Holmes had interviewed young McCarthy. When asked what he had learned, Holmes replied he had learned nothing—McCarthy could provide no clarity. Holmes had at first suspected McCarthy might know the culprit and was concealing them, but now believed the young man was as confused as everyone else. Though not very sharp, Holmes thought McCarthy seemed honest at heart and good-looking. Holmes's companion remarked that if McCarthy resisted marrying the charming Miss Turner, his taste was questionable. Holmes then revealed a sad story: McCarthy was deeply in love with Miss Turner. However, as a youth and before knowing her well (she had been away at school), he had impulsively married a barmaid in Bristol in secret. No one knew about this, and it caused him great distress—especially since his father urged him to propose to Miss Turner, something he desperately wished he could do but now found impossible. He had recently spent three days in Bristol with his barmaid wife, unbeknownst to his father. Significant to the case, Holmes noted, was that trouble for McCarthy had led the barmaid to break ties with him and reveal she was already married, ending any obligation to her and leaving McCarthy comforted. Holmes's interlocutor then asked who the real culprit was if McCarthy was innocent. Holmes highlighted two key points: first, that the victim had arranged to meet someone at the pool, someone other than his son, since McCarthy was away and his return was not known; and second, the victim called out 'Cooee!' before realizing his son was back. Holmes noted these were the essential facts in the case and suggested changing the subject to talk of George Meredith, leaving the investigation for the next day."

          "text_segment": "There was no rain, as Holmes had foretold, and the morning broke bright and cloudless. At nine o’clock Lestrade called for us with the carriage, and we set off for Hatherley Farm and the Boscombe Pool.\n“There is serious news this morning,” Lestrade observed. “It is said that Mr. Turner, of the Hall, is so ill that his life is despaired of.”\n“An elderly man, I presume?” said Holmes.\n“About sixty; but his constitution has been shattered by his life abroad, and he has been in failing health for some time. This business has had a very bad effect upon him. He was an old friend of McCarthy’s, and, I may add, a great benefactor to him, for I have learned that he gave him Hatherley Farm rent free.”\n“Indeed! That is interesting,” said Holmes.\n“Oh, yes! In a hundred other ways he has helped him. Everybody about here speaks of his kindness to him.”\n“Really! Does it not strike you as a little singular that this McCarthy, who appears to have had little of his own, and to have been under such obligations to Turner, should still talk of marrying his son to Turner’s daughter, who is, presumably, heiress to the estate, and that in such a very cocksure manner, as if it were merely a case of a proposal and all else would follow? It is the more strange, since we know that Turner himself was averse to the idea. The daughter told us as much. Do you not deduce something from that?”\n“We have got to the deductions and the inferences,” said Lestrade, winking at me. “I find it hard enough to tackle facts, Holmes, without flying away after theories and fancies.”\n“You are right,” said Holmes demurely; “you do find it very hard to tackle the facts.”\n“Anyhow, I have grasped one fact which you seem to find it difficult to get hold of,” replied Lestrade with some warmth.\n“And that is—”\n“That McCarthy senior met his death from McCarthy junior and that all theories to the contrary are the merest moonshine.”\n“Well, moonshine is a brighter thing than fog,” said Holmes, laughing. “But I am very much mistaken if this is not Hatherley Farm upon the left.”\n“Yes, that is it.” It was a widespread, comfortable-looking building, two-storied, slate-roofed, with great yellow blotches of lichen upon the grey walls. The drawn blinds and the smokeless chimneys, however, gave it a stricken look, as though the weight of this horror still lay heavy upon it. We called at the door, when the maid, at Holmes’ request, showed us the boots which her master wore at the time of his death, and also a pair of the son’s, though not the pair which he had then had. Having measured these very carefully from seven or eight different points, Holmes desired to be led to the court-yard, from which we all followed the winding track which led to Boscombe Pool.\nSherlock Holmes was transformed when he was hot upon such a scent as this. Men who had only known the quiet thinker and logician of Baker Street would have failed to recognise him. His face flushed and darkened. His brows were drawn into two hard black lines, while his eyes shone out from beneath them with a steely glitter. His face was bent downward, his shoulders bowed, his lips compressed, and the veins stood out like whipcord in his long, sinewy neck. His nostrils seemed to dilate with a purely animal lust for the chase, and his mind was so absolutely concentrated upon the matter before him that a question or remark fell unheeded upon his ears, or, at the most, only provoked a quick, impatient snarl in reply. Swiftly and silently he made his way along the track which ran through the meadows, and so by way of the woods to the Boscombe Pool. It was damp, marshy ground, as is all that district, and there were marks of many feet, both upon the path and amid the short grass which bounded it on either side. Sometimes Holmes would hurry on, sometimes stop dead, and once he made quite a little detour into the meadow. Lestrade and I walked behind him, the detective indifferent and contemptuous, while I watched my friend with the interest which sprang from the conviction that every one of his actions was directed towards a definite end.\nThe Boscombe Pool, which is a little reed-girt sheet of water some fifty yards across, is situated at the boundary between the Hatherley Farm and the private park of the wealthy Mr. Turner. Above the woods which lined it upon the farther side we could see the red, jutting pinnacles which marked the site of the rich landowner’s dwelling. On the Hatherley side of the pool the woods grew very thick, and there was a narrow belt of sodden grass twenty paces across between the edge of the trees and the reeds which lined the lake. Lestrade showed us the exact spot at which the body had been found, and, indeed, so moist was the ground, that I could plainly see the traces which had been left by the fall of the stricken man. To Holmes, as I could see by his eager face and peering eyes, very many other things were to be read upon the trampled grass. He ran round, like a dog who is picking up a scent, and then turned upon my companion.\n“What did you go into the pool for?” he asked.\n“I fished about with a rake. I thought there might be some weapon or other trace. But how on earth—”\n“Oh, tut, tut! I have no time! That left foot of yours with its inward twist is all over the place. A mole could trace it, and there it vanishes among the reeds. Oh, how simple it would all have been had I been here before they came like a herd of buffalo and wallowed all over it. Here is where the party with the lodge-keeper came, and they have covered all tracks for six or eight feet round the body. But here are three separate tracks of the same feet.” He drew out a lens and lay down upon his waterproof to have a better view, talking all the time rather to himself than to us. “These are young McCarthy’s feet. Twice he was walking, and once he ran swiftly, so that the soles are deeply marked and the heels hardly visible. That bears out his story. He ran when he saw his father on the ground. Then here are the father’s feet as he paced up and down. What is this, then? It is the butt-end of the gun as the son stood listening. And this? Ha, ha! What have we here? Tiptoes! tiptoes! Square, too, quite unusual boots! They come, they go, they come again—of course that was for the cloak. Now where did they come from?” He ran up and down, sometimes losing, sometimes finding the track until we were well within the edge of the wood and under the shadow of a great beech, the largest tree in the neighbourhood. Holmes traced his way to the farther side of this and lay down once more upon his face with a little cry of satisfaction. For a long time he remained there, turning over the leaves and dried sticks, gathering up what seemed to me to be dust into an envelope and examining with his lens not only the ground but even the bark of the tree as far as he could reach. A jagged stone was lying among the moss, and this also he carefully examined and retained. Then he followed a pathway through the wood until he came to the high road, where all traces were lost.\n“It has been a case of considerable interest,” he remarked, returning to his natural manner. “I fancy that this grey house on the right must be the lodge. I think that I will go in and have a word with Moran, and perhaps write a little note. Having done that, we may drive back to our luncheon. You may walk to the cab, and I shall be with you presently.”",
          "paraphrase_gemini-2.5-flash-preview-04-17": "As Holmes had predicted, the morning was clear and bright with no sign of rain. At nine o'clock, Lestrade picked us up in a carriage, and we headed for Hatherley Farm and Boscombe Pool. Lestrade mentioned they had serious news: Mr. Turner of the Hall was critically ill and not expected to live. Holmes inquired if he was old. Lestrade replied he was about sixty but in poor health due to his time abroad, and the recent events had worsened his condition. He was a close friend and a significant benefactor to McCarthy, having given him Hatherley Farm free of charge and helped him in many other ways, as local people confirmed. Holmes found this intriguing. He pointed out the oddity that McCarthy, with seemingly few resources and greatly indebted to Turner, would speak so confidently of marrying his son to Turner's daughter, the likely heir, especially knowing Turner opposed it, as his daughter had told them. Holmes asked if this fact didn't suggest something. Lestrade, winking at me, commented that Holmes was already moving on to deductions and theories, claiming he found it hard enough to stick to the facts. Holmes dryly agreed that Lestrade did find it very hard to deal with facts. Lestrade retorted that he, at least, had grasped one fact Holmes seemed to miss: that young McCarthy killed his father, and all other ideas were sheer nonsense. Holmes laughed, saying 'moonshine' was at least clearer than 'fog,' and then pointed out Hatherley Farm ahead on the left. It was a large, comfortable-looking two-story house with a slate roof and yellow lichen patches on the grey walls. However, drawn blinds and lack of smoke suggested the tragedy still weighed heavily upon it. We knocked, and the maid, at Holmes' request, showed us the boots worn by her master when he died, and a pair belonging to the son (though not the pair from that day). After meticulously measuring them, Holmes asked to be taken to the courtyard, from where we followed the winding path towards Boscombe Pool. Holmes underwent a noticeable change when intensely focused on an investigation. The calm, logical man of Baker Street was replaced by a figure with a flushed, darkened face, brows drawn into sharp lines, and piercing, steely eyes. His gaze was fixed downwards, his shoulders stooped, lips pressed together, and veins prominent in his neck. His breathing quickened, showing a primal eagerness for the hunt. He was so engrossed that questions went unnoticed or received only sharp, impatient replies. He moved swiftly and silently along the track through the fields and woods to the pool. The ground was damp and marshy, typical of the area, with many footmarks on the path and surrounding grass. Holmes would sometimes stride quickly, sometimes halt abruptly, and once, made a short detour into the meadow. Lestrade and I trailed behind; Lestrade appeared uninterested and dismissive, while I watched Holmes, certain that every action had a specific purpose. Boscombe Pool was a small, reed-bordered body of water, about fifty yards wide, located at the boundary between Hatherley Farm and Mr. Turner's private park. Above the woods on the far side, we could see the red towers of Turner's house. On the farm side, the woods were dense, and a twenty-yard strip of wet grass lay between the trees and the reeds lining the pool. Lestrade pointed out where the body was found; the wet ground clearly showed the impact marks from the man's fall. Holmes, judging by his keen expression and searching eyes, saw much more in the disturbed grass. He moved around like a dog sniffing a trail, then abruptly questioned Lestrade, asking why he had entered the pool. Lestrade explained he had raked it, looking for a weapon or other evidence, and asked how Holmes knew. Holmes dismissed the question impatiently, noting Lestrade's distinctive footprints (with an inward twist) were everywhere, easily traceable, vanishing into the reeds. He lamented not being there earlier, before others trampled the scene like a 'herd of buffalo.' He pointed out where the police party had been, covering tracks near the body for six to eight feet, but found three distinct sets of the same footprints farther away. Using his lens, lying on his waterproof, he examined the ground, muttering to himself. He identified these as young McCarthy's tracks: twice walking and once running swiftly (shown by deep sole prints and barely visible heels), which supported the son's account of running upon seeing his father fall. He then identified the father's tracks from pacing back and forth. Next, he found an impression from the butt of a gun, suggesting the son stood there listening. Finally, with excitement, he found tiptoe marks – 'Square, too, quite unusual boots!' – coming and going, and coming again (for the cloak). He pondered their origin, running back and forth, sometimes losing and regaining the trail, until he led us into the wood under the largest tree, a great beech. Tracing the path to the far side of the tree, he lay down again with a small sound of satisfaction. He remained there for a considerable time, sifting through leaves and twigs, collecting what looked like dust into an envelope, and examining the ground and even the tree bark with his lens. He also carefully examined and kept a jagged stone found among the moss. He then followed a path through the woods to the high road, where the trail disappeared. Regaining his usual composure, he remarked that it had been a very interesting case. He guessed the grey house on the right was the lodge. He decided to go speak with Moran there and perhaps write a note. Afterwards, they could drive back for lunch, telling me to walk to the cab and he would join me shortly.",
          "paraphrase_gpt-4.1-2025-04-14": "The weather was dry as Holmes had predicted, and the new day dawned clear and sunny. At nine o’clock, Lestrade arrived with a carriage to collect us, and we made our way to Hatherley Farm and Boscombe Pool. \n\n“There is troubling news today,” Lestrade commented. “Mr. Turner of the Hall is reportedly in such poor health that he may not survive.”\n\n“Is he an older gentleman?” Holmes asked.\n\n“He’s about sixty, but his health has been undermined by years living abroad, and he’s been unwell for a while. This whole matter has worsened his condition. He was a long-time friend of McCarthy’s and, I’ve learned, allowed him to use Hatherley Farm without paying rent. He’s also helped him generously in many other ways—everyone around here speaks highly of his kindness.”\n\n“That’s interesting,” said Holmes. “But isn’t it strange that McCarthy, who owed so much to Turner, should talk so confidently about marrying his son to Turner’s daughter, who is apparently the heiress? Especially since Turner himself was against this idea, as his daughter told us. Doesn’t that seem odd to you?”\n\n“We’re already into deductions,” Lestrade said with a wink at me. “I struggle just to deal with the facts, Holmes, and can’t chase after speculations.”\n\n“You’re quite right,” Holmes replied modestly. “You do have trouble with the facts.”\n\n“I understand one fact at least, which you seem to miss,” Lestrade retorted. “That McCarthy senior was killed by his son, and any theory otherwise is nonsense.”\n\n“Sometimes, nonsense is brighter than confusion,” Holmes replied with a laugh. “But I believe Hatherley Farm is just ahead on the left.”\n\nWe confirmed this—it was a large, comfortable two-story house, its grey walls marked by yellow lichen. Still, its drawn blinds and smokeless chimneys made it seem burdened by recent tragedy. At Holmes’s request, the maid showed us both the boots her master wore at his death and a pair belonging to the son, though not the exact pair worn at the time. Holmes measured them carefully, then asked to see the courtyard, where we all followed the twisting path leading to Boscombe Pool.\n\nHolmes underwent a transformation while investigating—those who knew him as the quiet, logical man from Baker Street might not have recognized him. His face became intense and focused, eyes sharp, and his attention fully absorbed in the investigation; any interruption was ignored or met with irritation. He moved quickly and silently through the meadows and woods toward the pool. The ground was marshy and showed the tracks of many feet. Sometimes Holmes rushed forward, other times stopped suddenly, or made a detour to examine something. Lestrade and I followed, he appearing unimpressed, while I watched Holmes keenly, confident that all his actions had a purpose.\n\nBoscombe Pool was a small, reed-surrounded lake about fifty yards wide at the border between Hatherley Farm and Mr. Turner’s private park. Through the trees on the far side, we could see the distinctive red gables of Turner’s house. The woods grew thick on the farm side, with a strip of wet grass between them and the reeds by the water. Lestrade pointed out where the body was found—the ground was still soft enough to show marks from where the man had fallen. While I could only see the obvious impressions, Holmes was able to read much more from the disturbed grass. He moved about energetically, then turned to my companion.\n\n“Why did you go into the pool?” Holmes asked.\n\n“I used a rake to see if there was a weapon or evidence in the water. How did you—”\n\n“Oh, please, I have no time! Your left foot with the inward turn is visible everywhere, and then disappears into the reeds. If only I’d arrived before so many people trampled the scene! Here is where the group with the lodge-keeper came, ruining all the tracks around the body. But look—here are three distinct sets from the same feet: young McCarthy’s. Twice walking, once running—the depth of the impressions shows he ran when he saw his father on the ground, confirming his story. Here are the father’s tracks as he paced about. What’s this? The butt of the gun marks the ground where the son waited. And this? Tiptoe prints—unusual square boots. They arrive, leave, return again—retrieving the cloak, perhaps. But from where did they come?”\n\nHolmes traced tracks back and forth until we entered the woods, stopping beneath a large beech tree. He examined the ground and bark carefully, collecting small samples, even studying a jagged stone among the moss. Then, he followed a path through the woods out to the main road, where the trail disappeared.\n\n“This case is quite fascinating,” he said, returning to his usual demeanor. “That grey house must be the lodge. I’ll speak to Moran and perhaps write a note. After, we can return for lunch. You two may go on ahead—I’ll join you soon.”"

There are other clues, but this should be enough for our search.' Lestrade laughed, saying, 'I'm afraid I'm still unconvinced.

'Alright,' Holmes said quietly. 'I offered you the opportunity. Here are your lodgings. Good-bye. I'll send you a message before I go.' After dropping Lestrade off, we drove to our hotel.

One was the fact that his father should, according to his account, cry ‘Cooee!’ before seeing him. The other was his singular dying reference to a rat. He mumbled several words, you understand, but that was all that caught the son’s ear. Now from this double point our research must commence, and we will begin it by presuming that what the lad says is absolutely true.”\n“What of this ‘Cooee!’ then?”\n“Well, obviously it could not have been meant for the son. The son, as far as he knew, was in Bristol. It was mere chance that he was within earshot. The ‘Cooee!’ was meant to attract the attention of whoever it was that he had the appointment with. But ‘Cooee’ is a distinctly Australian cry, and one which is used between Australians. There is a strong presumption that the person whom McCarthy expected to meet him at Boscombe Pool was someone who had been in Australia.”\n“What of the rat, then?”\nSherlock Holmes took a folded paper from his pocket and flattened it out on the table. “This is a map of the Colony of Victoria,” he said. “I wired to Bristol for it last night.” He put his hand over part of the map. “What do you read?”\n“ARAT,” I read.\n“And now?” He raised his hand.\n“BALLARAT.”\n“Quite so.

First, there was the detail that his father, according to his story, shouted 'Cooee!' before apparently seeing him. Second, there was his unusual final mention of a rat. You see, he mumbled several words, but only that one registered with his son. So, our investigation must start from these two significant points, and we'll begin by assuming the young man's statement is completely truthful.\" \"What do you make of this 'Cooee!' then?\" \"Well, clearly it wasn't intended for his son. As far as the son knew, he was in Bristol. His presence within earshot was purely accidental. The 'Cooee!' was meant to attract the attention of whoever he was scheduled to meet. But 'Cooee' is a distinctly Australian call, one commonly used between Australians. There's a strong likelihood, therefore, that the person McCarthy expected to encounter at Boscombe Pool had spent time in Australia.\" \"And what about the rat?\" Sherlock Holmes pulled a folded paper from his pocket and smoothed it out on the table. \"This is a map of the Colony of Victoria,\" he stated. \"I wired to Bristol for it last night.\" He covered a section of the map with his hand. \"What letters can you read?\" \"ARAT,\" I replied. \"And now?\" He lifted his hand. \"BALLARAT.\" \"Precisely.

He seemed to say more, but that was all the son could make out. These two points are where our investigation begins, working on the assumption that the young man’s testimony is accurate.\"\n\n\"What do you make of ‘Cooee!’ then?\"\n\n\"Clearly, it wasn’t intended for the son, since the father believed his son was in Bristol and it was only by coincidence that he was nearby. Instead, the call was most likely meant to reach the person the father was meeting. Importantly, ‘Cooee’ is a well-known call used among Australians, hinting that McCarthy was expecting to meet someone who had spent time in Australia at Boscombe Pool.\"\n\n\"And the rat?\"\n\nSherlock Holmes took a folded map from his pocket and laid it flat on the table. \"This is a map of the Victoria colony.

His slow, limping step and bowed shoulders gave the appearance of decrepitude, and yet his hard, deep-lined, craggy features, and his enormous limbs showed that he was possessed of unusual strength of body and of character. His tangled beard, grizzled hair, and outstanding, drooping eyebrows combined to give an air of dignity and power to his appearance, but his face was of an ashen white, while his lips and the corners of his nostrils were tinged with a shade of blue. It was clear to me at a glance that he was in the grip of some deadly and chronic disease.\n“Pray sit down on the sofa,” said Holmes gently. “You had my note?”\n“Yes, the lodge-keeper brought it up. You said that you wished to see me here to avoid scandal.”\n“I thought people would talk if I went to the Hall.”\n“And why did you wish to see me?” He looked across at my companion with despair in his weary eyes, as though his question was already answered.\n“Yes,” said Holmes, answering the look rather than the words. “It is so. I know all about McCarthy.”\nThe old man sank his face in his hands. “God help me!” he cried. “But I would not have let the young man come to harm. I give you my word that I would have spoken out if it went against him at the Assizes.”\n“I am glad to hear you say so,” said Holmes gravely.\n“I would have spoken now had it not been for my dear girl. It would break her heart—it will break her heart when she hears that I am arrested.”\n“It may not come to that,” said Holmes.\n“What?”\n“I am no official agent. I understand that it was your daughter who required my presence here, and I am acting in her interests. Young McCarthy must be got off, however.”\n“I am a dying man,” said old Turner. “I have had diabetes for years. My doctor says it is a question whether I shall live a month. Yet I would rather die under my own roof than in a gaol.”\nHolmes rose and sat down at the table with his pen in his hand and a bundle of paper before him. “Just tell us the truth,” he said. “I shall jot down the facts. You will sign it, and Watson here can witness it. Then I could produce your confession at the last extremity to save young McCarthy. I promise you that I shall not use it unless it is absolutely needed.”\n“It’s as well,” said the old man; “it’s a question whether I shall live to the Assizes, so it matters little to me, but I should wish to spare Alice the shock. And now I will make the thing clear to you; it has been a long time in the acting, but will not take me long to tell.\n“You didn’t know this dead man, McCarthy. He was a devil incarnate. I tell you that. God keep you out of the clutches of such a man as he. His grip has been upon me these twenty years, and he has blasted my life. I’ll tell you first how I came to be in his power.\n“It was in the early ’60’s at the diggings. I was a young chap then, hot-blooded and reckless, ready to turn my hand at anything; I got among bad companions, took to drink, had no luck with my claim, took to the bush, and in a word became what you would call over here a highway robber. There were six of us, and we had a wild, free life of it, sticking up a station from time to time, or stopping the wagons on the road to the diggings. Black Jack of Ballarat was the name I went under, and our party is still remembered in the colony as the Ballarat Gang.\n“One day a gold convoy came down from Ballarat to Melbourne, and we lay in wait for it and attacked it. There were six troopers and six of us, so it was a close thing, but we emptied four of their saddles at the first volley. Three of our boys were killed, however, before we got the swag. I put my pistol to the head of the wagon-driver, who was this very man McCarthy. I wish to the Lord that I had shot him then, but I spared him, though I saw his wicked little eyes fixed on my face, as though to remember every feature. We got away with the gold, became wealthy men, and made our way over to England without being suspected. There I parted from my old pals and determined to settle down to a quiet and respectable life. I bought this estate, which chanced to be in the market, and I set myself to do a little good with my money, to make up for the way in which I had earned it. I married, too, and though my wife died young she left me my dear little Alice. Even when she was just a baby her wee hand seemed to lead me down the right path as nothing else had ever done. In a word, I turned over a new leaf and did my best to make up for the past. All was going well when McCarthy laid his grip upon me.\n“I had gone up to town about an investment, and I met him in Regent Street with hardly a coat to his back or a boot to his foot.\n“‘Here we are, Jack,’ says he, touching me on the arm; ‘we’ll be as good as a family to you. There’s two of us, me and my son, and you can have the keeping of us. If you don’t—it’s a fine, law-abiding country is England, and there’s always a policeman within hail.’\n“Well, down they came to the west country, there was no shaking them off, and there they have lived rent free on my best land ever since. There was no rest for me, no peace, no forgetfulness; turn where I would, there was his cunning, grinning face at my elbow. It grew worse as Alice grew up, for he soon saw I was more afraid of her knowing my past than of the police. Whatever he wanted he must have, and whatever it was I gave him without question, land, money, houses, until at last he asked a thing which I could not give. He asked for Alice.\n“His son, you see, had grown up, and so had my girl, and as I was known to be in weak health, it seemed a fine stroke to him that his lad should step into the whole property. But there I was firm. I would not have his cursed stock mixed with mine; not that I had any dislike to the lad, but his blood was in him, and that was enough. I stood firm. McCarthy threatened. I braved him to do his worst. We were to meet at the pool midway between our houses to talk it over.\n“When I went down there I found him talking with his son, so I smoked a cigar and waited behind a tree until he should be alone. But as I listened to his talk all that was black and bitter in me seemed to come uppermost. He was urging his son to marry my daughter with as little regard for what she might think as if she were a slut from off the streets. It drove me mad to think that I and all that I held most dear should be in the power of such a man as this. Could I not snap the bond? I was already a dying and a desperate man. Though clear of mind and fairly strong of limb, I knew that my own fate was sealed. But my memory and my girl! Both could be saved if I could but silence that foul tongue. I did it, Mr. Holmes. I would do it again. Deeply as I have sinned, I have led a life of martyrdom to atone for it. But that my girl should be entangled in the same meshes which held me was more than I could suffer. I struck him down with no more compunction than if he had been some foul and venomous beast. His cry brought back his son; but I had gained the cover of the wood, though I was forced to go back to fetch the cloak which I had dropped in my flight. That is the true story, gentlemen, of all that occurred.”",

His slow, dragging gait and slumped shoulders suggested frailty, yet his strong, deeply etched, rugged face and large limbs indicated he possessed remarkable physical and mental fortitude. His untidy, graying beard and hair, coupled with prominent, downward-curving eyebrows, lent him an air of dignity and authority. However, his face was deathly pale, and his lips and the areas around his nostrils had a bluish tinge. It was immediately apparent to me that he was suffering from a serious, chronic illness. \"Please take a seat on the sofa,\" Holmes said gently. \"Did you receive my note?\" \"Yes, the lodge-keeper delivered it. You mentioned wanting to meet here to prevent gossip.\" \"I believed meeting at the Hall would cause people to talk.\" \"And why did you wish to see me?\" He gazed at my companion, his tired eyes filled with despair, as if the answer to his question was already known to him. \"Yes,\" Holmes responded, addressing his expression rather than his words. \"That is correct. I know everything about McCarthy.\" The elderly man buried his face in his hands. \"May God help me!\" he cried. \"But I would never have allowed the young man to be harmed. I assure you, I would have testified if things had gone against him at the Assizes.\" \"I am pleased to hear that,\" Holmes replied seriously. \"I would have confessed by now, were it not for my beloved daughter. It would break her heart—it will break her heart when she learns I am arrested.\" \"That outcome may not happen,\" said Holmes. \"What?\" \"I am not an official investigator. I understand your daughter requested my presence, and I am acting on her behalf. However, young McCarthy must be cleared.\" \"I am a dying man,\" the elder Turner stated. \"I've had diabetes for years. My doctor believes I might not live another month. Yet, I would prefer to die in my own home rather than in prison.\" Holmes stood up, moved to the table with a pen and paper, and sat down. \"Simply tell us the truth,\" he instructed. \"I will record the facts. You will sign it, and Mr. Watson here will witness it. Then I can use your confession as a last resort to save young McCarthy. I promise I will only produce it if absolutely necessary.\" \"That suits me,\" the old man agreed. \"Whether I live until the Assizes is uncertain anyway, so it matters little to me personally. But I desperately want to spare Alice the shock. Now, I will clarify everything; it has been a long-standing ordeal, but telling it won't take long. You didn't know this dead man, McCarthy. He was pure evil, I tell you. May God keep you away from the likes of him. He has dominated my life for twenty years and ruined it. I'll first explain how he gained power over me. It was in the early 1860s at the gold fields. I was young, hot-headed, and reckless, willing to try anything. I fell in with bad company, started drinking, had no luck with my claim, turned to outlawry, and in short, became what you would call a highway robber here. There were six of us, living a wild, free life, periodically raiding settlements or stopping supply wagons on the road to the diggings. I was known as Black Jack of Ballarat, and our group is still remembered in the colony as the Ballarat Gang. One day, a gold shipment was coming from Ballarat to Melbourne, and we ambushed it. There were six troopers and six of us, making it a close fight, but we unseated four of them with the first volley. However, three of our men were killed before we secured the loot. I held my pistol to the head of the wagon driver, who was none other than McCarthy. I deeply regret not shooting him then, but I spared him, though I saw his sharp little eyes studying my face, as if memorizing my features. We escaped with the gold, became rich, and traveled to England without suspicion. There, I separated from my old comrades and decided to settle down into a quiet, respectable existence. I purchased this estate, which happened to be available, and resolved to use my wealth for good, to compensate for how I acquired it. I also married, and though my wife passed away young, she left me my precious little Alice. Even as a tiny baby, her small hand seemed to guide me toward the right path as nothing else ever had. In essence, I reformed and did my utmost to redeem my past. Everything was going well until McCarthy seized control of me. I had gone to London regarding an investment and ran into him in Regent Street, looking destitute. 'Well met, Jack,' he said, touching my arm. 'We'll be like family to you. There are two of us, my son and me, and you can support us. If you refuse—England is a law-abiding country, and there's always a policeman nearby.' So, they came down to the west country and were impossible to get rid of, living rent-free on my best land ever since. There was no peace, no respite, no forgetting for me; wherever I turned, his cunning, leering face was there. It worsened as Alice grew up, because he quickly realized I feared her learning my past more than the police. Whatever he demanded, he got, without question—land, money, houses—until finally, he asked for something I could not give. He asked for Alice. His son, you see, had grown up, as had my daughter, and since I was known to be in poor health, he saw it as a brilliant plan for his son to inherit everything. But on that point, I was resolute. I would not allow his tainted lineage to mix with mine; not that I disliked the young man personally, but his father's blood was in him, and that was enough. I stood firm. McCarthy threatened me. I dared him to do his worst. We were scheduled to meet at the pool, halfway between our houses, to discuss it. When I arrived there, I found him talking with his son, so I lit a cigar and waited behind a tree until he was alone. But as I listened to their conversation, all the darkness and bitterness within me seemed to rise. He was pressuring his son to marry my daughter with utter disregard for her feelings, treating her as if she were a common street girl. It infuriated me to think that I and all that I held dearest were at the mercy of such a man. Could I not break free from this bond? I was already a dying and desperate man. Though my mind was clear and my limbs reasonably strong, I knew my own fate was sealed. But my past and my daughter! Both could be saved if I could just silence that vile mouth. I did it, Mr. Holmes. And I would do it again. As deeply as I have sinned, I have lived a life of suffering to atone for it. But for my daughter to be caught in the same trap that held me was more than I could bear. I struck him down with no more hesitation than if he had been a vicious, poisonous creature. His cry brought back his son, but I had reached the cover of the woods, although I had to return to retrieve the cloak I had dropped while fleeing. That, gentlemen, is the true account of everything that happened.",

However, his rugged face with deep lines and powerful frame suggested great physical and inner strength. His wild beard, graying hair, and prominent bushy eyebrows gave him an air of authority, yet his face was unnaturally pale, and his lips and nostrils had a bluish tint—clear signs to me that he was suffering from a serious, long-term illness.\n\n“Please have a seat on the sofa,” Holmes said softly. “Did you get my note?”\n“Yes, the lodge-keeper delivered it. You asked to see me here to avoid any gossip.”\n“I thought people might talk if I visited the Hall.”\n“And why did you want to see me?” He looked at Holmes with exhausted desperation, as if he already knew the reason.\n\n“Yes,” Holmes replied to his silent question. “You are correct. I know everything about McCarthy.”\n\nThe old man buried his face in his hands. “God help me!” he exclaimed. “But I wouldn’t have let the young man suffer. I promise I’d have spoken out if it went against him at the Assizes.”\n\n“I’m glad to hear that,” Holmes said seriously.\n\n“I would have spoken before, but for my dear daughter’s sake. It would devastate her—it will devastate her when she learns of my arrest.”\n\n“That might not happen,” Holmes replied.\n\n“What do you mean?”\n\n“I’m not an official detective. I understand it was your daughter who asked for my help, and I’m working to protect her. Still, young McCarthy needs to be exonerated.”\n\n“I’m a dying man,” Turner said. “I’ve suffered from diabetes for years. My doctor doubts I’ll last a month. But I’d rather die at home than in prison.”\n\nHolmes took a seat at the table, picking up a pen and some paper. “Just tell us the truth,” he said. “I’ll write down the details—you’ll sign it, with Watson as a witness. I’ll only use your confession if it’s absolutely necessary to save young McCarthy.”\n\n“That’s probably best,” the old man agreed. “I might not live till the Assizes, and I’d rather spare Alice the pain. Let me explain everything—it has a long history but won’t take long to recount.\n\n“You didn’t know the victim, McCarthy. He was truly evil. May you never be in such a man’s power. For twenty years, he’s ruined my life. Let me explain how he gained control over me.\n\n“Back in the early 1860s, during the gold rush, I was a rash young man, fell in with the wrong crowd, drank heavily, failed with my gold claim, and ended up as a highway robber—a bushranger. There were six of us in what became known as the Ballarat Gang. My alias was Black Jack of Ballarat. We led a wild life, robbing stations and stopping wagons.\n\n“One day, a gold shipment traveled from Ballarat to Melbourne, and we ambushed it. With six troopers and six of us, the odds were even. At our first volley, four troopers fell, though three of us also died before we got the loot. I threatened the wagon-driver—McCarthy—with my pistol. In hindsight, I wish I had killed him, but I spared him, even though I saw him stare at me as if to memorize my face. With the stolen gold, we became wealthy and quietly relocated to England. I parted ways with my old associates and decided to lead an honest life. I bought this estate, tried to use my wealth for good, and married. Though my wife died young, she left me Alice, my beloved daughter. Even as a child, her innocence helped me reform. I tried to make up for my past and everything seemed fine until McCarthy found me.\n\n“While in London on business, I bumped into him on Regent Street—he was down on his luck. He approached me, saying, ‘We’re like family now—me and my son—and you’ll support us. If not, well, England is a law-abiding place and the police are always nearby.’\n\n“So they came to live on my land. I couldn’t get rid of them, and they never paid rent for the best part of my estate. I had no peace—everywhere I turned, his sly face was there. It got worse as Alice grew up, because he saw I feared her learning of my past even more than the law. Whatever he wanted, I gave—property, money, houses—until he asked for the one thing I couldn’t give: my daughter. \n\n“His son and Alice had grown up, and since I was ill, he thought his son marrying Alice would secure all my property. But I drew the line there. I didn’t dislike the boy, but I couldn’t stand the thought of his blood mixing with mine. I held firm. McCarthy threatened me, but I met him at the pool midway between our houses to discuss it.\n\n“When I arrived, he was talking with his son, so I waited nearby, smoking a cigar. Listening to him urge his son to marry my daughter as if she were a nobody filled me with fury. The idea that everything I cared about was in the control of such a man drove me mad. I was a dying man, already desperate, but I still thought clearly and was fairly strong. My fate was sealed, but I could still save my reputation and my daughter if only I could silence him. So I did. I struck him as if he were a poisonous creature. His cry brought his son back, but I escaped into the woods, returning only to pick up my lost cloak. That’s the whole story, gentlemen, of what happened.”"

Some, however, have already gained publicity through the papers, and others have not offered a field for those peculiar qualities which my friend possessed in so high a degree, and which it is the object of these papers to illustrate. Some, too, have baffled his analytical skill, and would be, as narratives, beginnings without an ending, while others have been but partially cleared up, and have their explanations founded rather upon conjecture and surmise than on that absolute logical proof which was so dear to him. There is, however, one of these last which was so remarkable in its details and so startling in its results that I am tempted to give some account of it in spite of the fact that there are points in connection with it which never have been, and probably never will be, entirely cleared up.\nThe year ’87 furnished us with a long series of cases of greater or less interest, of which I retain the records. Among my headings under this one twelve months I find an account of the adventure of the Paradol Chamber, of the Amateur Mendicant Society, who held a luxurious club in the lower vault of a furniture warehouse, of the facts connected with the loss of the British barque Sophy Anderson, of the singular adventures of the Grice Patersons in the island of Uffa, and finally of the Camberwell poisoning case. In the latter, as may be remembered, Sherlock Holmes was able, by winding up the dead man’s watch, to prove that it had been wound up two hours before, and that therefore the deceased had gone to bed within that time—a deduction which was of the greatest importance in clearing up the case. All these I may sketch out at some future date, but none of them present such singular features as the strange train of circumstances which I have now taken up my pen to describe.",

However, some have already received public attention in the newspapers, and others did not allow for the demonstration of those specific abilities my friend possessed to such an exceptional degree, which is the purpose of these accounts to highlight. Furthermore, some cases baffled his analytical skill and would be incomplete narratives, starting points without resolution, while others were only partially clarified, their explanations resting more on educated guesses and speculation than on the definitive logical evidence he valued so greatly. Nevertheless, there is one such case, despite being only partially solved, that was so extraordinary in its details and so surprising in its results that I am persuaded to describe it, even though certain aspects remain, and will likely always remain, unclear. The year 1887 presented us with a lengthy series of cases of varying interest, all of which I have recorded. Among my entries for that year, I find accounts of the adventure of the Paradol Chamber, the Amateur Mendicant Society, which maintained an opulent club in the basement vaults of a furniture warehouse, the circumstances surrounding the loss of the British sailing ship Sophy Anderson, the unusual experiences of the Grice Patersons on the island of Uffa, and finally the Camberwell poisoning case. In that last instance, as you may recall, Sherlock Holmes was able to determine, by winding the deceased's watch, that it had been wound up two hours earlier, thereby establishing that the victim had gone to bed within that period—a deduction of immense importance in solving the case.

Some cases have already become known to the public through newspaper reports, while others did not provide opportunities to showcase the unique talents my friend possessed and which I aim to highlight in these writings. There are also cases that even Holmes' sharp analytical mind could not entirely solve, resulting in narratives without satisfactory conclusions, and some that remain only partly explained and rest more on speculation than on solid evidence, which Holmes valued so highly. Despite this, there is one particular case from this latter group, remarkable in its details and astonishing in its outcome, that I feel compelled to share, even though certain aspects of it remain unresolved and may never be fully clarified.\n\nIn 1887, we encountered a succession of cases, some more noteworthy than others, all of which I have documented. Among these, I note the adventure of the Paradol Chamber, the tale of the Amateur Mendicant Society who maintained an extravagant club beneath a furniture warehouse, details concerning the disappearance of the British barque Sophy Anderson, the peculiar experiences of the Grice Paterson family on Uffa Island, and lastly, the Camberwell poisoning case. In that particular instance, Holmes demonstrated that by checking the wound-up time on the deceased man's watch, he could show it had been wound only two hours earlier, thus establishing when the man had gone to bed — a pivotal clue in solving the mystery. I might detail these cases at another time, but none of them exhibit the unusual characteristics of the extraordinary sequence of events I am about to describe."

My wife was on a visit to her mother’s, and for a few days I was a dweller once more in my old quarters at Baker Street.\n“Why,” said I, glancing up at my companion, “that was surely the bell. Who could come to-night? Some friend of yours, perhaps?”\n“Except yourself I have none,” he answered. “I do not encourage visitors.”\n“A client, then?”\n“If so, it is a serious case. Nothing less would bring a man out on such a day and at such an hour. But I take it that it is more likely to be some crony of the landlady’s.”\nSherlock Holmes was wrong in his conjecture, however, for there came a step in the passage and a tapping at the door. He stretched out his long arm to turn the lamp away from himself and towards the vacant chair upon which a newcomer must sit.\n“Come in!” said he.",

The wind had shrieked and the rain had battered the windows all day long, forcing us, even here in the center of vast, artificial London, to momentarily shift our focus from our daily routines and acknowledge the existence of the mighty natural forces that seem to scream at mankind through the constraints of civilization, like wild animals in a cage. As night fell, the storm intensified, growing louder, and the wind made sorrowful, crying sounds like a child in the chimney. Sherlock Holmes sat rather grimly by the fireplace, organizing his crime records, while I was absorbed in a captivating sea story by Clark Russell. The noise of the gale outside seemed to merge with the narrative, and the drumming of the rain felt like the long, sweeping wash of ocean waves. My wife was visiting her mother, so I was staying back in my old rooms at Baker Street for a few days. Looking up at my companion, I remarked, \"Surely, that was the bell. Who could possibly be arriving tonight? Perhaps a friend of yours?\" He replied, \"Aside from you, I have none. I don't encourage visitors.\" I pressed, \"A client, then?\" \"If so, it must be a significant case,\" he answered. \"Nothing less important would make someone come out on such a day and at such an hour. But I believe it's more likely to be an acquaintance of the landlady.\" Sherlock Holmes was mistaken, however, as footsteps were heard in the hall, followed by a knock at the door.

The wind howled all day and rain battered the windows, forcing even those of us in the center of bustling, man-made London to pause from daily routines and feel the power of nature raging against human civilization, like wild beasts behind bars. As night approached, the storm only intensified, with the wind wailing and moaning down the chimney. Sherlock Holmes sat gloomily on one side of the fireplace, organizing his crime records, while I was captivated by a sea novel by Clark Russell, the storm outside merging in my mind with the ocean scenes in the book. Since my wife was visiting her mother, I was once again staying in my old rooms on Baker Street for several days. \"Was that the bell?\" I asked Holmes, looking up. \"Who could be visiting at this hour—maybe a friend of yours?\" \"Besides you, I have no friends,\" he replied. \"I don't encourage visitors.\" \"A client, then?\" I suggested. \"If so, it must be a pressing matter. Only something very serious would bring anyone out on a night like this. But more likely, it's someone connected to the landlady.\" Holmes's guess proved wrong, as footsteps sounded in the hall, followed by a knock at our door.

It is a hereditary matter; so in order to give you an idea of the facts, I must go back to the commencement of the affair.\n“You must know that my grandfather had two sons—my uncle Elias and my father Joseph. My father had a small factory at Coventry, which he enlarged at the time of the invention of bicycling. He was a patentee of the Openshaw unbreakable tire, and his business met with such success that he was able to sell it and to retire upon a handsome competence.\n“My uncle Elias emigrated to America when he was a young man and became a planter in Florida, where he was reported to have done very well. At the time of the war he fought in Jackson’s army, and afterwards under Hood, where he rose to be a colonel. When Lee laid down his arms my uncle returned to his plantation, where he remained for three or four years. About 1869 or 1870 he came back to Europe and took a small estate in Sussex, near Horsham. He had made a very considerable fortune in the States, and his reason for leaving them was his aversion to the negroes, and his dislike of the Republican policy in extending the franchise to them. He was a singular man, fierce and quick-tempered, very foul-mouthed when he was angry, and of a most retiring disposition. During all the years that he lived at Horsham, I doubt if ever he set foot in the town. He had a garden and two or three fields round his house, and there he would take his exercise, though very often for weeks on end he would never leave his room. He drank a great deal of brandy and smoked very heavily, but he would see no society and did not want any friends, not even his own brother.\n“He didn’t mind me; in fact, he took a fancy to me, for at the time when he saw me first I was a youngster of twelve or so. This would be in the year 1878, after he had been eight or nine years in England. He begged my father to let me live with him and he was very kind to me in his way. When he was sober he used to be fond of playing backgammon and draughts with me, and he would make me his representative both with the servants and with the tradespeople, so that by the time that I was sixteen I was quite master of the house. I kept all the keys and could go where I liked and do what I liked, so long as I did not disturb him in his privacy. There was one singular exception, however, for he had a single room, a lumber-room up among the attics, which was invariably locked, and which he would never permit either me or anyone else to enter. With a boy’s curiosity I have peeped through the keyhole, but I was never able to see more than such a collection of old trunks and bundles as would be expected in such a room.",
          "paraphrase_gemini-2.5-flash-preview-04-17": "The young man drew his chair closer and extended his damp feet towards the fire. He stated his name was John Openshaw, but felt that his personal affairs likely had little connection to this dreadful situation. He explained that it was a family matter, and to provide them with the necessary background, he would need to begin at the start of the events. He mentioned that his grandfather had two sons: his uncle Elias and his father Joseph. His father Joseph owned a small factory in Coventry, which he expanded significantly when bicycling became popular. Joseph held a patent for the Openshaw unbreakable tire, and his business became so successful that he was able to sell it and retire with considerable financial comfort. His uncle Elias emigrated to America as a young man and established himself as a successful planter in Florida. During the Civil War, he served first under Jackson and later Hood, eventually reaching the rank of colonel. After Lee surrendered, his uncle returned to his plantation for about three or four years. Around 1869 or 1870, he came back to Europe and bought a small estate near Horsham in Sussex. He had amassed a substantial fortune in the United States. His decision to leave was influenced by his intense dislike of Black people and his opposition to the Republican policy of granting them the right to vote. He was an unusual man, described as fierce and hot-tempered, prone to using offensive language when angry, and extremely reclusive. John doubted he ever ventured into Horsham town during his time there. He had a garden and a few fields around his house, where he would take exercise, though he often stayed confined to his room for weeks at a time. He drank and smoked heavily, avoided all social contact, and did not desire friends, not even his own brother. However, he seemed to tolerate John; in fact, he took a liking to him, possibly because John was only about twelve when they first met, around 1878 (after Elias had been in England for eight or nine years). Elias urged John's father to allow John to live with him and was kind to John in his own way. When sober, he enjoyed playing backgammon and draughts with John. He also made John his representative when dealing with servants and tradespeople, so that by the time he was sixteen, John was essentially in charge of the household. He held all the keys and was free to go and do as he pleased, as long as he did not disturb his uncle's solitude. There was one significant exception: a single locked room, a storage room in the attic, which he or anyone else was never permitted to enter. Driven by a boy's curiosity, John peered through the keyhole but could never see anything more than the kind of collection of old trunks and bundles one would expect in such a room.",

          "text_segment": "“One day—it was in March, 1883—a letter with a foreign stamp lay upon the table in front of the colonel’s plate. It was not a common thing for him to receive letters, for his bills were all paid in ready money, and he had no friends of any sort. ‘From India!’ said he as he took it up, ‘Pondicherry postmark! What can this be?’ Opening it hurriedly, out there jumped five little dried orange pips, which pattered down upon his plate. I began to laugh at this, but the laugh was struck from my lips at the sight of his face. His lip had fallen, his eyes were protruding, his skin the colour of putty, and he glared at the envelope which he still held in his trembling hand, ‘K. K. K.!’ he shrieked, and then, ‘My God, my God, my sins have overtaken me!’\n“‘What is it, uncle?’ I cried.\n“‘Death,’ said he, and rising from the table he retired to his room, leaving me palpitating with horror. I took up the envelope and saw scrawled in red ink upon the inner flap, just above the gum, the letter K three times repeated. There was nothing else save the five dried pips. What could be the reason of his overpowering terror? I left the breakfast-table, and as I ascended the stair I met him coming down with an old rusty key, which must have belonged to the attic, in one hand, and a small brass box, like a cashbox, in the other.\n“‘They may do what they like, but I’ll checkmate them still,’ said he with an oath. ‘Tell Mary that I shall want a fire in my room to-day, and send down to Fordham, the Horsham lawyer.’\n“I did as he ordered, and when the lawyer arrived I was asked to step up to the room. The fire was burning brightly, and in the grate there was a mass of black, fluffy ashes, as of burned paper, while the brass box stood open and empty beside it. As I glanced at the box I noticed, with a start, that upon the lid was printed the treble K which I had read in the morning upon the envelope.\n“‘I wish you, John,’ said my uncle, ‘to witness my will. I leave my estate, with all its advantages and all its disadvantages, to my brother, your father, whence it will, no doubt, descend to you. If you can enjoy it in peace, well and good! If you find you cannot, take my advice, my boy, and leave it to your deadliest enemy. I am sorry to give you such a two-edged thing, but I can’t say what turn things are going to take. Kindly sign the paper where Mr. Fordham shows you.’\n“I signed the paper as directed, and the lawyer took it away with him. The singular incident made, as you may think, the deepest impression upon me, and I pondered over it and turned it every way in my mind without being able to make anything of it. Yet I could not shake off the vague feeling of dread which it left behind, though the sensation grew less keen as the weeks passed and nothing happened to disturb the usual routine of our lives. I could see a change in my uncle, however. He drank more than ever, and he was less inclined for any sort of society. Most of his time he would spend in his room, with the door locked upon the inside, but sometimes he would emerge in a sort of drunken frenzy and would burst out of the house and tear about the garden with a revolver in his hand, screaming out that he was afraid of no man, and that he was not to be cooped up, like a sheep in a pen, by man or devil. When these hot fits were over, however, he would rush tumultuously in at the door and lock and bar it behind him, like a man who can brazen it out no longer against the terror which lies at the roots of his soul. At such times I have seen his face, even on a cold day, glisten with moisture, as though it were new raised from a basin.\n“Well, to come to an end of the matter, Mr. Holmes, and not to abuse your patience, there came a night when he made one of those drunken sallies from which he never came back. We found him, when we went to search for him, face downward in a little green-scummed pool, which lay at the foot of the garden. There was no sign of any violence, and the water was but two feet deep, so that the jury, having regard to his known eccentricity, brought in a verdict of ‘suicide.’ But I, who knew how he winced from the very thought of death, had much ado to persuade myself that he had gone out of his way to meet it. The matter passed, however, and my father entered into possession of the estate, and of some £ 14,000, which lay to his credit at the bank.”\n“One moment,” Holmes interposed, “your statement is, I foresee, one of the most remarkable to which I have ever listened. Let me have the date of the reception by your uncle of the letter, and the date of his supposed suicide.”\n“The letter arrived on March 10, 1883. His death was seven weeks later, upon the night of May 2nd.”\n“Thank you. Pray proceed.”",
          "paraphrase_gemini-2.5-flash-preview-04-17": "One day in March, specifically in 1883, my uncle found a letter with a foreign stamp on his breakfast table. Receiving mail was unusual for him since he paid all his bills with cash and had no friends. Picking it up, he remarked, 'From India! It has a Pondicherry postmark! What could this be?' He tore it open quickly, and five small, dried orange seeds fell onto his plate. I started to laugh, but his expression instantly stopped me. His lower lip sagged, his eyes bulged, his skin turned the color of putty, and he stared intensely at the envelope clutched in his shaking hand. 'K. K. K.!' he screamed, then added, 'Oh God, oh God, my past deeds have caught up with me!' 'What's wrong, Uncle?' I exclaimed. 'Death,' he replied, and standing up from the table, he went to his room, leaving me trembling with fear. I picked up the envelope and saw the letter K scrawled three times in red ink on the inside flap, just above the adhesive. There was nothing else inside except the five dried seeds. What could have caused such overwhelming terror? I left the breakfast table and went upstairs, where I encountered him coming down. In one hand, he held an old, rusty key, presumably from the attic, and in the other, a small brass box resembling a cashbox. 'Let them try what they want, but I'll still outsmart them,' he swore. 'Tell Mary I need a fire in my room today, and send for Fordham, the lawyer in Horsham.' I followed his instructions, and when the lawyer arrived, I was asked to join them in the room. A bright fire was burning, and in the fireplace lay a pile of black, fluffy ash, like burned paper. The brass box stood open and empty nearby. As I glanced at the box, I was startled to see that the lid was marked with the triple K I had seen on the envelope that morning. 'John,' my uncle said, 'I want you to witness my will. I'm leaving my entire estate, with all its benefits and drawbacks, to my brother, your father, from whom it will undoubtedly pass to you. If you can enjoy it in peace, excellent! If you find you cannot, take my advice, son, and give it to your worst enemy. I regret leaving you with something so potentially problematic, but I don't know how things will turn out. Please sign the paper where Mr. Fordham indicates.' I signed the document as requested, and the lawyer took it with him. As you can imagine, this strange event deeply affected me. I thought about it constantly, turning it over in my mind without understanding it. Yet, I couldn't shake off the unsettling feeling of dread it left behind, although this feeling lessened as weeks passed without anything disrupting our normal lives. However, I did notice a change in my uncle. He drank more than before and was less interested in company. He spent most of his time locked in his room, but sometimes he would emerge in a drunken rage, rush out of the house, and run wildly around the garden with a revolver, shouting that he feared no man and would not be confined like livestock by anyone. When these angry fits subsided, he would rush back inside and secure the door behind him, like a man unable to keep up a brave front against the terror consuming him. At these times, even on a cold day, I saw his face glistening with sweat, as if he had just emerged from water. To conclude, Mr. Holmes, and not to try your patience, there came a night when he made one of those drunken outings from which he never returned. When we searched for him, we found him face down in a small pool covered in green scum at the bottom of the garden. There were no signs of violence, and the water was only two feet deep, so the jury, considering his known peculiarities, concluded it was suicide. But I, knowing how much he dreaded even the thought of death, found it hard to believe he had deliberately sought it out. The matter concluded, my father inherited the estate, along with about £14,000 he had in the bank.\n'One moment,' Holmes interrupted, 'your story is, I anticipate, one of the most extraordinary I have ever heard. Please provide me with the date your uncle received the letter and the date of his presumed suicide.' 'The letter arrived on March 10, 1883. His death occurred seven weeks later, on the night of May 2nd.' 'Thank you. Please continue.'",
          "paraphrase_gpt-4.1-2025-04-14": "One day, in March of 1883, a letter with a foreign stamp was delivered to the table in front of the colonel. This was unusual, since he rarely received letters, having no friends and always paying his bills in cash. Picking up the letter, he remarked, 'From India! Pondicherry postmark! What could this be?' As he quickly opened the envelope, five tiny dried orange seeds fell out onto his plate. At first I laughed, but the expression on his face stopped me—his lips sagged, eyes bulged, his complexion ashen, and he stared in terror at the envelope gripped in his trembling hand. He shouted, 'K. K. K.!' followed by an exclamation about his sins catching up to him. \n\nI asked him what was wrong, and he replied with a single word: death. He then left the table and went to his room, leaving me frightened. Examining the envelope, I saw the letters 'K K K' written in red ink inside the flap, above the seal. Nothing else accompanied the five dried seeds. I wondered about the cause of his obvious terror. Leaving the breakfast table, I met him coming down the stairs, holding an old, rusty key—probably for the attic—in one hand, and a small, brass box like a cashbox in the other. He swore that he'd outmaneuver whoever sent the letter, asked me to tell Mary to prepare a fire in his room, and to contact Mr. Fordham, the lawyer in Horsham.\n\nI did as he asked, and when the lawyer arrived, I was called to my uncle's room. A fire burned brightly in the grate, producing a pile of black, ashy remnants of burned paper. The brass box sat open and empty next to the fireplace. On its lid were printed the three Ks, just like on the envelope. My uncle told me he wanted me to witness his will, leaving the entire estate, with whatever benefits or burdens, to his brother—my father—so it would eventually come to me. He advised that if I could live in peace on the estate, to do so; if not, to leave it to an enemy, because he didn't know what might happen. He instructed me to sign where the lawyer indicated. I did so, the lawyer left, and the strange events made a deep impression on me. Despite brooding over it, I couldn't figure out what it meant, but an uneasy fear lingered with me. This fear slowly faded over the weeks when nothing else happened to change our usual lives. I did notice my uncle changed, drinking more and withdrawing from company. He locked himself in his room much of the time, only coming out during bursts of drunken bravado in which he'd run around the garden with a revolver, shouting that no one could trap him. After these episodes, he'd rush back inside and barricade the door, sweating with fear. \n\nEventually, one night he went out in another drunken fit and never returned. We found him face down in a shallow, algae-covered garden pool. There were no signs of foul play, and the water was only two feet deep, so the jury declared it suicide, citing his odd behavior. But knowing how afraid he was of death, I struggled to believe he had taken his own life. Still, the matter was considered settled, with my father inheriting the estate and £14,000 in the bank.\n\nAt this point, Holmes interrupted, noting how remarkable the story seemed and asked for the dates of the letter's arrival and the death. I replied: the letter arrived on March 10, 1883, and his death occurred seven weeks later, on the night of May 2nd. Holmes thanked me and asked me to continue."

K. repeated upon it, and ‘Letters, memoranda, receipts, and a register’ written beneath. These, we presume, indicated the nature of the papers which had been destroyed by Colonel Openshaw. For the rest, there was nothing of much importance in the attic save a great many scattered papers and note-books bearing upon my uncle’s life in America. Some of them were of the war time and showed that he had done his duty well and had borne the repute of a brave soldier. Others were of a date during the reconstruction of the Southern states, and were mostly concerned with politics, for he had evidently taken a strong part in opposing the carpet-bag politicians who had been sent down from the North.\n“Well, it was the beginning of ’84 when my father came to live at Horsham, and all went as well as possible with us until the January of ’85. On the fourth day after the new year I heard my father give a sharp cry of surprise as we sat together at the breakfast-table. There he was, sitting with a newly opened envelope in one hand and five dried orange pips in the outstretched palm of the other one. He had always laughed at what he called my cock-and-bull story about the colonel, but he looked very scared and puzzled now that the same thing had come upon himself.\n“‘Why, what on earth does this mean, John?’ he stammered.\n“My heart had turned to lead. ‘It is K. K. K.,’ said I.\n“He looked inside the envelope. ‘So it is,’ he cried. ‘Here are the very letters. But what is this written above them?’\n“‘Put the papers on the sundial,’ I read, peeping over his shoulder.\n“‘What papers? What sundial?’ he asked.\n“‘The sundial in the garden. There is no other,’ said I; ‘but the papers must be those that are destroyed.’\n“‘Pooh!’ said he, gripping hard at his courage. ‘We are in a civilised land here, and we can’t have tomfoolery of this kind. Where does the thing come from?’\n“‘From Dundee,’ I answered, glancing at the postmark.\n“‘Some preposterous practical joke,’ said he. ‘What have I to do with sundials and papers? I shall take no notice of such nonsense.’\n“‘I should certainly speak to the police,’ I said.\n“‘And be laughed at for my pains. Nothing of the sort.’\n“‘Then let me do so?’\n“‘No, I forbid you. I won’t have a fuss made about such nonsense.’\n“It was in vain to argue with him, for he was a very obstinate man. I went about, however, with a heart which was full of forebodings.\n“On the third day after the coming of the letter my father went from home to visit an old friend of his, Major Freebody, who is in command of one of the forts upon Portsdown Hill. I was glad that he should go, for it seemed to me that he was farther from danger when he was away from home. In that, however, I was in error. Upon the second day of his absence I received a telegram from the major, imploring me to come at once. My father had fallen over one of the deep chalk-pits which abound in the neighbourhood, and was lying senseless, with a shattered skull. I hurried to him, but he passed away without having ever recovered his consciousness. He had, as it appears, been returning from Fareham in the twilight, and as the country was unknown to him, and the chalk-pit unfenced, the jury had no hesitation in bringing in a verdict of ‘death from accidental causes.’ Carefully as I examined every fact connected with his death, I was unable to find anything which could suggest the idea of murder. There were no signs of violence, no footmarks, no robbery, no record of strangers having been seen upon the roads. And yet I need not tell you that my mind was far from at ease, and that I was well-nigh certain that some foul plot had been woven round him.\n“In this sinister way I came into my inheritance. You will ask me why I did not dispose of it? I answer, because I was well convinced that our troubles were in some way dependent upon an incident in my uncle’s life, and that the danger would be as pressing in one house as in another.",
          "paraphrase_gemini-2.5-flash-preview-04-17": "When my father took possession of the Horsham estate, he conducted a thorough search of the attic, which had always been kept locked, at my request. There we found the brass box, although its contents had been removed or destroyed. A paper label was affixed to the inside of the lid, bearing the initials K. K. K. repeated multiple times, with 'Letters, memoranda, receipts, and a register' written beneath. We presumed these labels indicated the nature of the documents that Colonel Openshaw had destroyed. Beyond this, the attic contained little else of significant interest, save for a large number of scattered papers and notebooks documenting my uncle's life in America. Some of these dated from the time of the war and demonstrated his exemplary service and reputation as a brave soldier. Others were from the period following the war, during the reconstruction of the Southern states, and were primarily concerned with politics, as he had evidently taken a strong stand against the 'carpet-bag' politicians sent from the North. My father moved to Horsham in early 1884, and our lives proceeded without incident until January 1885. On the fourth day after the start of the new year, while we were having breakfast, I heard my father utter a sharp exclamation of surprise. He was seated with a recently opened envelope in one hand and five dried orange pips displayed in the outstretched palm of the other. He had always scoffed at what he called my outlandish tale about the colonel, but now he looked utterly terrified and confused, facing the very same ominous sign himself. 'Good heavens, John, what does this mean?' he stammered. My heart felt like lead. 'It's K. K. K.,' I replied. He peered inside the envelope. 'Indeed it is,' he cried. 'Here are the letters themselves. But what is written above them?' 'Put the papers on the sundial,' I read aloud, looking over his shoulder. 'Which papers? What sundial?' he questioned. 'The sundial in the garden. There isn't another,' I said; 'but the papers must be the ones that were destroyed.' 'Nonsense!' he said, attempting to steel his resolve. 'We are in a civilized country now, and we cannot tolerate such foolishness. Where did this come from?' 'From Dundee,' I answered, noting the postmark. 'Some absurd prank,' he declared. 'What connection do I have with sundials and papers? I shall pay no attention to such silliness.' 'I believe you should definitely inform the police,' I suggested. 'And be mocked for my troubles? Certainly not.' 'Then allow me to do so?' 'No, I forbid it. I will not have a commotion made over such trifles.' It was useless to argue with him, as he was a very stubborn man. However, I went about my day with a heart heavy with dreadful premonitions. Three days after receiving the letter, my father left home to visit an old friend, Major Freebody, who commands a fort on Portsdown Hill. I was glad he went, feeling he would be safer away from the house. In this, however, I was mistaken. On the second day of his absence, I received a telegram from the major, urgently requesting my presence. My father had fallen into one of the deep chalk pits common in the area and was found unconscious with a severely fractured skull. I rushed to his side, but he passed away without ever regaining consciousness. It seems he had been returning from Fareham at dusk, and as he was unfamiliar with the route and the chalk pit was unfenced, the jury had no hesitation in ruling his death accidental. Despite my meticulous examination of every aspect related to his death, I could find nothing to suggest it was murder. There were no signs of struggle or violence, no footprints indicating another person, no theft, and no reports of strangers seen on the roads. And yet, I need not tell you that my mind was far from settled, and I was almost certain that he had been the victim of some wicked plot. This tragic event led to my inheritance. You might ask why I didn't sell the property. My answer is that I was thoroughly convinced that our misfortunes were somehow tied to an event in my uncle's life, and that the danger would be just as present in any other house.",

K. and underneath, the words ‘Letters, memoranda, receipts, and a register’—which we believe described the destroyed contents, likely disposed of by Colonel Openshaw. Apart from this, the attic held nothing especially noteworthy except for many scattered documents and notebooks about my uncle’s life in America. Some dated back to the war, indicating his honorable record as a brave soldier, while others were from the Southern states’ reconstruction era, mainly about politics, since he had been apparently active in resisting Northern ‘carpet-bagger’ officials.\n\nMy father began living at Horsham at the start of 1884, and we had no troubles until January of 1885. Four days after New Year, while we were having breakfast, my father suddenly cried out in shock, holding an opened envelope in one hand and five dried orange pips in the other. Though he’d always dismissed my warnings regarding the colonel as fanciful, he now looked frightened and confused as he realized the same threat had come to him.\n\n‘What does this mean, John?’ he asked shakily. My heart sank as I replied, ‘It’s from K. K. K.’ He checked the envelope and saw the very same initials. ‘But what is written above them?’ he wondered. We read together: ‘Put the papers on the sundial.’\n\n‘What papers? What sundial?’ He questioned. I explained it must refer to the sundial in our garden, and the ‘papers’ must be those already destroyed. Trying to remain brave, he dismissed it as ridiculous: ‘We’re in a civilized country; such nonsense can’t harm us. Where did it come from?’\n\n‘From Dundee,’ I said after checking the postmark. He insisted it must be some tasteless prank, unrelated to us, and wanted to ignore it.\n\nI suggested we contact the police, but he refused and forbade me from making any fuss, being a stubborn man despite my deep unease.\n\nThree days later, my father left to visit his old friend, Major Freebody, who commanded a fort on Portsdown Hill.

The second day after his departure, I received an urgent telegram from the major: my father had fallen into a deep chalk-pit near Fareham and lay unconscious with a fractured skull. I rushed to see him, but he died without ever waking. The inquest declared it a simple accident: he must have wandered into unfamiliar territory in the evening twilight, and with the chalk-pit left open, no suspicion fell on anyone—no violence, thief, or strangers, and no evidence of murder at all. Despite this, I could not shake my conviction that there was evil behind it.\n\nThus, I inherited the house under these shadowy circumstances. Why didn’t I simply leave the property? Because I believed our danger was tied to an event in my uncle’s past, and moving elsewhere would make no difference."

He rummaged in his coat pocket, and, drawing out a piece of discoloured, blue-tinted paper, he laid it out upon the table. “I have some remembrance,” said he, “that on the day when my uncle burned the papers I observed that the small, unburned margins which lay amid the ashes were of this particular colour. I found this single sheet upon the floor of his room, and I am inclined to think that it may be one of the papers which has, perhaps, fluttered out from among the others, and in that way has escaped destruction. Beyond the mention of pips, I do not see that it helps us much. I think myself that it is a page from some private diary. The writing is undoubtedly my uncle’s.”\nHolmes moved the lamp, and we both bent over the sheet of paper, which showed by its ragged edge that it had indeed been torn from a book. It was headed, “March, 1869,” and beneath were the following enigmatical notices:\n“4th. Hudson came. Same old platform.\n“7th.

The young man confessed, burying his face in his thin, pale hands, \"To be honest, I felt powerless, like one of those poor rabbits paralyzed as a snake approaches. I feel trapped by some irresistible, inescapable evil that no amount of planning or caution can prevent.\" \"Nonsense!\" exclaimed Sherlock Holmes. \"You must act, man, or you are doomed! Only decisive energy can save you. This is no moment for giving in to despair.\" \"I have spoken to the police,\" the young man stated. \"Ah!\" responded Holmes. \"But they just smiled when I told them my story. I'm sure the inspector thinks the letters are just practical jokes, and that my relatives' deaths were truly accidents, as the juries concluded, unrelated to the warnings.\" Holmes shook his fists in frustration. \"Unbelievable stupidity!\" he cried. \"Still,\" the young man added, \"they have allowed me to have a policeman stay in the house with me.\" \"Did he accompany you tonight?\" Holmes asked. \"No. His instructions were to remain at the house,\" he replied. Holmes gestured wildly again in annoyance. \"Why did you come to me?\" he demanded, \"and most importantly, why didn't you come immediately?\" \"I didn't know I should,\" he explained. \"It was only today I confided in Major Prendergast about my troubles, and he advised me to see you.\" \"It's actually been two days since you received the letter,\" Holmes pointed out. \"We should have acted sooner. You don't have any more evidence, do you, beyond what you've shown us—no other suggestive detail that might help?\" \"There is one thing,\" said John Openshaw. He searched his coat pocket and pulled out a piece of faded, blue-tinged paper, spreading it on the table. \"I remember,\" he said, \"that on the day my uncle burned the papers, I noticed that the small, unburnt edges among the ashes were this particular colour. I found this single sheet on the floor of his room, and I'm inclined to believe it might be one of the papers that perhaps fluttered out from the rest and thus escaped destruction. Apart from mentioning pips, I don't see how it helps us much. Personally, I think it's a page from some private diary. The writing is undoubtedly my uncle's.\" Holmes adjusted the lamp, and we both leaned over the paper. Its torn edge confirmed it had been ripped from a book. It was headed \"March, 1869,\" and beneath were these puzzling entries: \"4th. Hudson arrived. Same old routine.\" \"7th. Issued the pips to McCauley, Paramore, and John Swain of St. Augustine.\" \"9th. McCauley was cleared.\" \"10th. John Swain was cleared.\" \"12th. Visited Paramore. Everything was fine.\"",
          "paraphrase_gpt-4.1-2025-04-14": "It was in January 1885 when my unfortunate father died, and since then, over two years and eight months have passed. In that period, I have lived peacefully in Horsham and began to believe that the family curse might have left us, perhaps ending with my father's generation. But I was wrong to find relief so soon; yesterday morning, the threat returned in exactly the same form as it had for my father.\n\nThe young man retrieved a wrinkled envelope from his vest and, turning to the table, poured out five small dried orange seeds onto it.\n\n\"This is the envelope,\" he explained. \"It was postmarked in London—eastern division. Inside are the same words as my father's final message: 'K. K. K.' and 'Put the papers on the sundial.'\"\n\n\"What actions have you taken?\" asked Holmes.\n\n\"None.\"\n\n\"None at all?\"\n\n\"Honestly,\" he said, burying his face in his pale hands, \"I’ve felt powerless, like a rabbit facing an oncoming snake. It feels as if some unstoppable, inevitable evil is closing in on me, impossible to escape no matter what precautions I take.\"\n\n\"Nonsense!\" Sherlock Holmes exclaimed. \"You must do something, or you will be doomed. Only action can help you now. This is not the time to give up hope.\"\n\n\"I went to the police.\"\n\n\"Really?\"\n\n\"But they listened politely and dismissed my story. I’m sure the inspector thinks the letters are nothing but a joke, and that my relatives’ deaths were just accidental, as the jury decided. They don’t see any connection with the warnings.\"\n\nHolmes threw his hands up, frustrated. \"Such foolishness!\" he cried.\n\n\"They did assign a policeman to stay at my house.\"\n\n\"Is he here with you tonight?\"\n\n\"No, he was ordered to remain at the house.\"\n\nHolmes grew more agitated.\n\n\"Why did you come to me now, and not sooner?\"\n\n\"I didn’t know what to do. It was only today, after talking with Major Prendergast, that I was advised to come to you.\"\n\n\"You received the letter two days ago. We should have acted earlier. Do you have any more evidence—anything else that might help us?\"\n\n\"There's one thing,\" John Openshaw replied. He searched his coat pocket, then produced a yellowed, blue-tinted piece of paper and laid it on the table. \"I remember that when my uncle burned his papers, some small unburned scraps in the ashes were this color. I found this sheet in his room, and I think it may have fallen out from the rest and avoided being burned. Aside from mentioning pips, I’m not sure it tells us much. It appears to be a page from his private diary. The writing is definitely his.\"\n\nHolmes adjusted the lamp, and together we inspected the ragged-edged page, clearly torn from a book. It was titled \"March, 1869,\" and beneath were several mysterious entries:\n\n\"4th. Hudson came. Same old platform.\n\n7th. Set the pips on McCauley, Paramore, and John Swain of St. Augustine.\n\n9th. McCauley cleared.\n\n10th. John Swain cleared.\n\n12th. Visited Paramore. All well.\""

You must also put in a note to say that all the other papers were burned by your uncle, and that this is the only one which remains.

          "text_segment": "Sherlock Holmes sat for some time in silence, with his head sunk forward and his eyes bent upon the red glow of the fire. Then he lit his pipe, and leaning back in his chair he watched the blue smoke-rings as they chased each other up to the ceiling.\n“I think, Watson,” he remarked at last, “that of all our cases we have had none more fantastic than this.”\n“Save, perhaps, the Sign of Four.”\n“Well, yes. Save, perhaps, that. And yet this John Openshaw seems to me to be walking amid even greater perils than did the Sholtos.”\n“But have you,” I asked, “formed any definite conception as to what these perils are?”\n“There can be no question as to their nature,” he answered.\n“Then what are they? Who is this K. K. K., and why does he pursue this unhappy family?”\nSherlock Holmes closed his eyes and placed his elbows upon the arms of his chair, with his finger-tips together. “The ideal reasoner,” he remarked, “would, when he had once been shown a single fact in all its bearings, deduce from it not only all the chain of events which led up to it but also all the results which would follow from it. As Cuvier could correctly describe a whole animal by the contemplation of a single bone, so the observer who has thoroughly understood one link in a series of incidents should be able to accurately state all the other ones, both before and after. We have not yet grasped the results which the reason alone can attain to. Problems may be solved in the study which have baffled all those who have sought a solution by the aid of their senses. To carry the art, however, to its highest pitch, it is necessary that the reasoner should be able to utilise all the facts which have come to his knowledge; and this in itself implies, as you will readily see, a possession of all knowledge, which, even in these days of free education and encyclopædias, is a somewhat rare accomplishment. It is not so impossible, however, that a man should possess all knowledge which is likely to be useful to him in his work, and this I have endeavoured in my case to do. If I remember rightly, you on one occasion, in the early days of our friendship, defined my limits in a very precise fashion.”\n“Yes,” I answered, laughing. “It was a singular document. Philosophy, astronomy, and politics were marked at zero, I remember. Botany variable, geology profound as regards the mud-stains from any region within fifty miles of town, chemistry eccentric, anatomy unsystematic, sensational literature and crime records unique, violin-player, boxer, swordsman, lawyer, and self-poisoner by cocaine and tobacco. Those, I think, were the main points of my analysis.”\nHolmes grinned at the last item. “Well,” he said, “I say now, as I said then, that a man should keep his little brain-attic stocked with all the furniture that he is likely to use, and the rest he can put away in the lumber-room of his library, where he can get it if he wants it. Now, for such a case as the one which has been submitted to us to-night, we need certainly to muster all our resources. Kindly hand me down the letter K of the American Encyclopædia which stands upon the shelf beside you. Thank you. Now let us consider the situation and see what may be deduced from it. In the first place, we may start with a strong presumption that Colonel Openshaw had some very strong reason for leaving America. Men at his time of life do not change all their habits and exchange willingly the charming climate of Florida for the lonely life of an English provincial town. His extreme love of solitude in England suggests the idea that he was in fear of someone or something, so we may assume as a working hypothesis that it was fear of someone or something which drove him from America. As to what it was he feared, we can only deduce that by considering the formidable letters which were received by himself and his successors. Did you remark the postmarks of those letters?”\n“The first was from Pondicherry, the second from Dundee, and the third from London.”\n“From East London. What do you deduce from that?”\n“They are all seaports. That the writer was on board of a ship.”\n“Excellent. We have already a clue. There can be no doubt that the probability—the strong probability—is that the writer was on board of a ship. And now let us consider another point. In the case of Pondicherry, seven weeks elapsed between the threat and its fulfilment, in Dundee it was only some three or four days. Does that suggest anything?”\n“A greater distance to travel.”\n“But the letter had also a greater distance to come.”\n“Then I do not see the point.”\n“There is at least a presumption that the vessel in which the man or men are is a sailing-ship. It looks as if they always send their singular warning or token before them when starting upon their mission. You see how quickly the deed followed the sign when it came from Dundee. If they had come from Pondicherry in a steamer they would have arrived almost as soon as their letter. But, as a matter of fact, seven weeks elapsed. I think that those seven weeks represented the difference between the mail-boat which brought the letter and the sailing vessel which brought the writer.”\n“It is possible.”\n“More than that. It is probable. And now you see the deadly urgency of this new case, and why I urged young Openshaw to caution. The blow has always fallen at the end of the time which it would take the senders to travel the distance. But this one comes from London, and therefore we cannot count upon delay.”\n“Good God!” I cried. “What can it mean, this relentless persecution?”\n“The papers which Openshaw carried are obviously of vital importance to the person or persons in the sailing-ship. I think that it is quite clear that there must be more than one of them. A single man could not have carried out two deaths in such a way as to deceive a coroner’s jury. There must have been several in it, and they must have been men of resource and determination. Their papers they mean to have, be the holder of them who it may. In this way you see K. K. K. ceases to be the initials of an individual and becomes the badge of a society.”\n“But of what society?”\n“Have you never—” said Sherlock Holmes, bending forward and sinking his voice—“have you never heard of the Ku Klux Klan?”",
          "paraphrase_gemini-2.5-flash-preview-04-17": "For a while, Sherlock Holmes sat in silence, his head bowed and his gaze fixed on the fiery glow in the fireplace. Then, he lit his pipe and leaned back, observing the rings of blue smoke drift upwards towards the ceiling. “I believe, Watson,” he eventually commented, “that among all our investigations, this one stands out as the most extraordinary.” “Perhaps, with the exception of the Sign of Four.” “Yes, indeed. Perhaps that one. Yet, this John Openshaw appears to be facing even greater dangers than the Sholtos encountered.” “But have you,” I inquired, “formed any clear idea of what these dangers entail?” “Their nature is beyond doubt,” he replied. “In that case, what are they? Who is this K.K.K., and why do they pursue this unfortunate family?” Sherlock Holmes closed his eyes and rested his elbows on the arms of his chair, pressing his fingertips together. “The perfect reasoner,” he observed, “given a single fact and understanding it fully, would be able to infer not only the sequence of events that led to it but also all the consequences that would follow. Just as Cuvier could accurately describe an entire animal from contemplating a single bone, an observer who has thoroughly understood one element in a series of occurrences should be able to precisely outline all the others, both past and future. We haven't fully grasped the potential that pure reason holds. Problems that have stumped those relying on their senses can be solved through contemplation. However, to elevate this skill to its highest level, the reasoner must be able to utilize all the information they have acquired; and this, as you will readily see, implies possessing comprehensive knowledge, which, even now with widespread education and encyclopaedias, is quite rare. Nonetheless, it is not impossible for someone to possess all the knowledge likely to be useful in their profession, and this I have strived to achieve in my own work. If I recall correctly, early in our acquaintance, you once very specifically defined my intellectual limitations.” “Yes,” I answered, chuckling. “It was a peculiar document. Philosophy, astronomy, and politics were marked as zero, as I remember. Botany was variable, geology was profound concerning mud-stains from anywhere within fifty miles of the city, chemistry was eccentric, anatomy unsystematic, sensational literature and criminal records were unique, and you were listed as a violin player, boxer, swordsman, lawyer, and someone who poisoned himself with cocaine and tobacco. Those, I believe, were the key points of my analysis.” Holmes grinned at the final item. “Well,” he said, “I maintain now, as I did then, that one should keep the small attic of their mind furnished only with things they are likely to need, storing the rest in the lumber-room of their library, accessible if required. Now, for a case like the one presented to us tonight, we certainly need to call upon all our resources. Please hand me the volume of the American Encyclopædia containing the letter K, which is on the shelf next to you. Thank you. Now, let's examine the situation and see what can be deduced. Firstly, we can strongly presume that Colonel Openshaw had a compelling reason to leave America. Men of his age don't typically change all their habits and willingly swap the pleasant climate of Florida for a solitary existence in an English provincial town. His intense desire for solitude in England suggests he was fearful of someone or something, so we can work on the hypothesis that fear drove him from America. As for what he feared, we can only infer that by considering the ominous letters received by him and his successors. Did you notice the postmarks on those letters?” “The first was from Pondicherry, the second from Dundee, and the third from London.” “From East London. What do you conclude from that?” “They are all seaports. That the sender was aboard a ship.” “Excellent. We already have a clue. There can be no doubt that the strong probability is the writer was on board a ship. Now let's consider another point. In the Pondicherry instance, seven weeks passed between the warning and its execution, while in Dundee, it was only about three or four days. Does that suggest anything?” “A greater distance to travel.” “But the letter also had a greater distance to cover.” “Then I don't grasp the significance.” “There is at least a presumption that the vessel carrying the man or men is a sailing-ship. It appears they always send their unusual warning or token ahead of them when they embark on their mission. You see how quickly the act followed the sign when it came from Dundee. If they had come from Pondicherry in a steamer, they would have arrived almost as soon as their letter. But, in reality, seven weeks elapsed. I believe those seven weeks represent the difference between the mail-boat that delivered the letter and the sailing vessel that carried the writer.” “That's possible.” “More than possible. It's probable. And now you see the critical urgency of this new case, and why I urged young Openshaw to be cautious. The blow has consistently fallen at the end of the time it would take the senders to cover the distance. But this one comes from London, meaning we cannot expect a delay.” “Good Heavens!” I exclaimed. “What can this relentless persecution mean?” “The papers Openshaw carried are clearly of vital importance to the individual or individuals on the sailing-ship. I think it's quite evident there must be more than one of them. A single person couldn't have carried out two deaths in a manner that fooled a coroner's jury. There must have been several involved, and they must be resourceful and determined men. They intend to retrieve their papers, no matter who holds them. In this way, you see K.K.K. ceases to be the initials of one person and becomes the emblem of a society.” “But what society?” “Have you never—” said Sherlock Holmes, leaning forward and lowering his voice—“have you never heard of the Ku Klux Klan?”",
          "paraphrase_gpt-4.1-2025-04-14": "Sherlock Holmes sat silently for a while, his head bowed and his gaze fixed on the fire. After some contemplation, he lit his pipe and watched the drifting smoke. At last, he said to Watson, \"Of all our cases, few have been as strange as this one.\" Watson suggested that perhaps only The Sign of Four surpassed it in peculiarity, but Holmes felt that John Openshaw was in even greater danger than the Sholtos had been. Watson asked Holmes if he had determined what dangers Openshaw faced. Holmes replied that he had no doubts about their nature, prompting Watson to ask for more details and the identity of 'K. K. K.' who was pursuing the family. Holmes explained, closing his eyes, that a true reasoner, once having insight into any particular fact, should be able to deduce all related events, both leading up and subsequent. Like Cuvier reconstructing an animal from only one bone, an attentive observer can discern the entire sequence of incidents from one clear link. Many unsolved puzzles can be resolved by reasoning alone, but to achieve this fully requires assembling all pertinent facts, demanding rare breadth of knowledge. Holmes noted that, while it is unrealistic for someone to know everything, a man should at least be thoroughly informed about anything essential to his work—a standard Holmes tried to uphold in his own life. Watson recalled, with amusement, his past attempt to delineate Holmes’s knowledge—remarking on Holmes’s strengths and weaknesses in various subjects and talents such as music and boxing, as well as his self-medication. Holmes agreed, reiterating that one should keep only useful knowledge at the ready and store the rest away until needed. Returning to the case, Holmes asked for the 'K' volume of the encyclopedia, intending to consult it. He reasoned that Colonel Openshaw must have had a compelling reason to leave America and live in seclusion in England, likely from fear. The threatening letters received by Openshaw and his heirs suggested a link to their pursuers. Holmes asked Watson to recall the postmarks: Pondicherry, Dundee, and London—all ports. Watson deduced the sender must have been on a ship. Holmes elaborated further, noting the time between receiving threats and their fulfillment corresponded to the travel distance—it took seven weeks from Pondicherry, three or four days from Dundee. This indicated the sender traveled by sailing ship, with their warnings sent in advance of their arrival. The short time between threat and crime when coming from Dundee implied proximity. Since the current letter was sent from London, the threat was now immediate. Watson was alarmed and questioned the purpose of the persecution. Holmes explained the papers Openshaw possessed must be of extreme value to those aboard the sailing ship, and that more than one person was involved, capable of orchestrating multiple deaths undetected. Their goal was to retrieve the documents, regardless of the holder's identity. Therefore, 'K. K. K.' referred not to a person, but to a society. When Watson pressed as to which society, Holmes asked, \"Have you never heard of the Ku Klux Klan?\""

A name derived from the fanciful resemblance to the sound produced by cocking a rifle. This terrible secret society was formed by some ex-Confederate soldiers in the Southern states after the Civil War, and it rapidly formed local branches in different parts of the country, notably in Tennessee, Louisiana, the Carolinas, Georgia, and Florida. Its power was used for political purposes, principally for the terrorising of the negro voters and the murdering and driving from the country of those who were opposed to its views. Its outrages were usually preceded by a warning sent to the marked man in some fantastic but generally recognised shape—a sprig of oak-leaves in some parts, melon seeds or orange pips in others. On receiving this the victim might either openly abjure his former ways, or might fly from the country. If he braved the matter out, death would unfailingly come upon him, and usually in some strange and unforeseen manner. So perfect was the organisation of the society, and so systematic its methods, that there is hardly a case upon record where any man succeeded in braving it with impunity, or in which any of its outrages were traced home to the perpetrators. For some years the organisation flourished in spite of the efforts of the United States government and of the better classes of the community in the South. Eventually, in the year 1869, the movement rather suddenly collapsed, although there have been sporadic outbreaks of the same sort since that date.’\n“You will observe,” said Holmes, laying down the volume, “that the sudden breaking up of the society was coincident with the disappearance of Openshaw from America with their papers. It may well have been cause and effect. It is no wonder that he and his family have some of the more implacable spirits upon their track. You can understand that this register and diary may implicate some of the first men in the South, and that there may be many who will not sleep easy at night until it is recovered.”\n“Then the page we have seen—”\n“Is such as we might expect. It ran, if I remember right, ‘sent the pips to A, B, and C’—that is, sent the society’s warning to them. Then there are successive entries that A and B cleared, or left the country, and finally that C was visited, with, I fear, a sinister result for C. Well, I think, Doctor, that we may let some light into this dark place, and I believe that the only chance young Openshaw has in the meantime is to do what I have told him. There is nothing more to be said or to be done to-night, so hand me over my violin and let us try to forget for half an hour the miserable weather and the still more miserable ways of our fellow men.”",
          "paraphrase_gemini-2.5-flash-preview-04-17": "“No, I never have.” Holmes flipped through the pages of the book on his lap. \"Ah, here it is,\" he announced soon after: \"'Ku Klux Klan. The name is thought to mimic the sound of cocking a rifle. This fearsome clandestine organisation was founded by former Confederate soldiers in the Southern states after the Civil War. It quickly established local branches across the country, particularly in Tennessee, Louisiana, the Carolinas, Georgia, and Florida. Its influence was wielded for political ends, mainly by intimidating Black voters and by murdering or forcing out of the area those who opposed its beliefs. Their violent acts were typically preceded by a distinctive, though widely recognised, warning sent to the intended target—perhaps an oak sprig in some regions, or melon seeds or orange pips in others. Upon receiving this, the target had the choice to publicly renounce their previous activities or flee the territory. If they chose to stay and face the threat, death was certain and often occurred in an unusual and unexpected manner. The society's structure was so perfect and its methods so systematic that there is scarcely any recorded instance where someone successfully defied it unharmed, or where any of its terrible deeds were conclusively linked back to the perpetrators. The organisation thrived for several years despite the efforts of the United States government and the more respectable members of Southern society. Eventually, in 1869, the movement saw a relatively sudden decline, although there have been occasional resurgences of similar activity since then.'\" \"You'll note,\" Holmes remarked, closing the book, \"that the organisation's sudden dissolution happened at the same time that Openshaw left America with their documents. It's quite possible that one caused the other. It's hardly surprising that he and his family have been relentlessly pursued by some of the more unforgiving individuals involved. You can see that this ledger and journal might implicate some of the South's most prominent figures, and that many people will be unable to rest easy until it's recovered.\" \"So the page we saw—\" \"Is exactly what we would expect. It read, as I recall, 'sent the pips to A, B, and C'—meaning they received the society's warning. Following entries indicate that A and B departed or left the country, and finally that C was 'visited', with, I fear, a fatal outcome for C. Well, Doctor, I believe we might be able to shed some light on this dark affair, and my opinion is that young Openshaw's only chance right now is to follow my advice. There is nothing more to discuss or do tonight, so please pass me my violin and let us try to forget the dreadful weather and the even more dreadful nature of our fellow humans for half an hour.\" ",

The name comes from its supposed similarity to the sound of a rifle being cocked. This secret, dangerous group was started by former Confederate soldiers in the Southern United States after the Civil War. It quickly spread, with branches in many states, especially Tennessee, Louisiana, the Carolinas, Georgia, and Florida. The organization mainly used its influence for political ends, chiefly by intimidating Black voters and by attacking or forcing out anyone who disagreed with it. Victims would first receive a warning in some unusual but recognizable form—a sprig of oak leaves, or sometimes melon seeds or orange pips. After this, the person warned could either openly reject his previous actions or flee. Those who chose to stay almost always ended up being killed, often in unexpected ways. The society was so well organized and methodical in its actions that there are very few instances where someone withstood them safely or where the crimes could be traced back to its members. The group thrived for several years, despite the efforts of the federal government and respectable members of Southern society. Eventually, in 1869, the movement rapidly dissolved, but there have been occasional outbursts of similar activity since then.\" \nHolmes closed the book and observed, \"You'll notice that the sudden disappearance of the society matches the time Openshaw left America with their documents. Perhaps this is more than coincidence. No wonder the family remains a target for vengeful members. If these records and journals reveal the involvement of leading Southerners, it's clear some people won't rest until they get them back.\"\n\"So the page we saw—\"\n\"Is exactly what we'd expect. It recorded, 'sent the pips to A, B, and C'—in other words, those individuals received the society's warnings. There were later notes that A and B left the area, and finally that C was 'visited'—which likely ended badly for C. Well, Doctor, I believe we've shed some light on this mystery, and Openshaw's best hope is to follow my advice without delay. There's nothing else we can do tonight, so please give me my violin, and let's try to distract ourselves from the dreary weather and the even drearier actions of humankind for a little while.\""

How was it done?” He spoke calmly, but I could see that he was deeply moved.\n“My eye caught the name of Openshaw, and the heading ‘Tragedy Near Waterloo Bridge.’ Here is the account:\n“‘Between nine and ten last night Police-Constable Cook, of the H Division, on duty near Waterloo Bridge, heard a cry for help and a splash in the water. The night, however, was extremely dark and stormy, so that, in spite of the help of several passers-by, it was quite impossible to effect a rescue.

It is conjectured that he may have been hurrying down to catch the last train from Waterloo Station, and that in his haste and the extreme darkness he missed his path and walked over the edge of one of the small landing-places for river steamboats. The body exhibited no traces of violence, and there can be no doubt that the deceased had been the victim of an unfortunate accident, which should have the effect of calling the attention of the authorities to the condition of the riverside landing-stages.’”\nWe sat in silence for some minutes, Holmes more depressed and shaken than I had ever seen him.\n“That hurts my pride, Watson,” he said at last. “It is a petty feeling, no doubt, but it hurts my pride. It becomes a personal matter with me now, and, if God sends me health, I shall set my hand upon this gang. That he should come to me for help, and that I should send him away to his death—!” He sprang from his chair and paced about the room in uncontrollable agitation, with a flush upon his sallow cheeks and a nervous clasping and unclasping of his long thin hands.\n“They must be cunning devils,” he exclaimed at last. “How could they have decoyed him down there? The Embankment is not on the direct line to the station. The bridge, no doubt, was too crowded, even on such a night, for their purpose. Well, Watson, we shall see who will win in the long run. I am going out now!”\n“To the police?”\n“No; I shall be my own police. When I have spun the web they may take the flies, but not before.”",
          "paraphrase_gemini-2.5-flash-preview-04-17": "The morning had become clear, and the sun provided a muted light through the hazy layer that hangs over the sprawling city. When I came downstairs, Sherlock Holmes was already eating breakfast. He apologized for not waiting, explaining that he expected a very demanding day ahead focused on investigating the case involving young Openshaw. I inquired what approach he planned to take. He responded that it would heavily depend on the outcomes of his initial inquiries, and that he might, after all, need to travel down to Horsham. I asked if he would go there first. 'No,' he replied, 'I will begin in the City. Please ring the bell, and the maid will bring your coffee.' As I waited, I picked up the untouched newspaper from the table and quickly scanned it. My eyes landed on a headline that sent a shiver through me. 'Holmes!' I exclaimed, 'You're too late!' 'Ah!' he said, setting down his cup, 'I suspected as much. How did it happen?' He spoke calmly, yet I could tell he was profoundly affected. 'My gaze caught the name Openshaw and the heading 'Tragedy Near Waterloo Bridge.'' Here is the full report: 'Between 9 and 10 o'clock last night, Police-Constable Cook of the H Division, who was on duty near Waterloo Bridge, heard a cry for help followed by a splash in the water. However, the night was exceedingly dark and stormy, making a rescue impossible despite the assistance of several passers-by. Nevertheless, the alarm was raised, and with the help of the water police, the body was eventually recovered. It was identified as that of a young man whose name, according to an envelope found in his pocket, was John Openshaw. His residence is located near Horsham. It is speculated that he may have been rushing to catch the last train from Waterloo Station and, in his haste and the severe darkness, lost his way and fell over the edge of one of the small landing areas used by river steamboats. There were no signs of violence on the body, and it is believed the deceased was the victim of a tragic accident. The report concluded by stating the incident should bring the state of riverside landing stages to the attention of the authorities.' We sat in silence for several minutes; Holmes appeared more dejected and troubled than I had ever witnessed. 'That wounds my pride, Watson,' he finally said. 'It's a trivial emotion, I know, but it does hurt my pride. This has now become a personal matter for me, and, if I have the health, I will relentlessly pursue this group. That he should seek my help, and that I should dismiss him to his death—!' He suddenly sprang from his chair and began pacing the room in unrestrained turmoil, a flush on his pale cheeks and his long, thin hands anxiously opening and closing. 'They must be cunning devils,' he declared at last. 'How could they have lured him down there? The Embankment is not a direct route to the station. The bridge itself, even on such a night, was probably too crowded for their plan. Well, Watson, we shall see who prevails in the end. I am going out now!' 'To the police?' I asked. 'No; I shall be my own police force. Once I have woven the web, they may catch the flies, but not before.'",

H. for J. O.' He then sealed the envelope and addressed it to 'Captain James Calhoun, Barque Lone Star, Savannah, Georgia.' Chuckling, he commented, 'That will be waiting for him when he reaches port. It ought to cost him a night's sleep. He'll see it as a clear sign of his impending doom, just as Openshaw did before him.' 'And who is this Captain Calhoun?' I asked. 'He is the leader of the group,' Holmes explained. 'I'll catch the others too, but he is my priority.' 'How did you manage to track them down, then?' I asked. He pulled a large sheet of paper from his pocket, covered densely with dates and names. 'I've spent the whole day,' he said, 'poring over Lloyd's shipping registers and old newspaper archives. I followed the movements of every ship that docked at Pondicherry in January and February of '83. There were thirty-six vessels of significant size reported there during that period. Of these, one, the Lone Star, immediately caught my attention. Although its reported clearance was from London, the name itself belongs to one of the United States.' 'Texas, I believe,' I interjected. 'I wasn't, and still am not, certain which state,' Holmes responded, 'but I knew the ship had to be American in origin.' 'What steps did you take next?' I asked. 'I checked the records in Dundee,' he continued, 'and when I found that the barque Lone Star was there in January '85, my suspicion turned into certainty. I then made inquiries about the ships currently in London's port.' 'And?' I prompted. 'The Lone Star arrived here last week,' he stated. 'I went down to the Albert Dock and discovered she had been taken down the river by the early morning tide, heading home to Savannah. I wired Gravesend and learned she had already passed there some time ago. Given the easterly wind, I'm confident she's now beyond the Goodwins and relatively close to the Isle of Wight.' 'So, what will your next move be?' I asked. 'Oh, I have him exactly where I want him,' Holmes declared. 'He and the two mates are, from what I gather, the only American-born crew members on board. The rest are Finnish and German. I also know, having learned it from the stevedore who loaded their cargo, that all three were off the ship last night. By the time their sailing vessel reaches Savannah, the mail ship will have delivered this letter, and a cable will have informed the Savannah police that these three men are urgently wanted here on murder charges.'",

          "text_segment": "Isa Whitney, brother of the late Elias Whitney, D.D., Principal of the Theological College of St. George’s, was much addicted to opium. The habit grew upon him, as I understand, from some foolish freak when he was at college; for having read De Quincey’s description of his dreams and sensations, he had drenched his tobacco with laudanum in an attempt to produce the same effects. He found, as so many more have done, that the practice is easier to attain than to get rid of, and for many years he continued to be a slave to the drug, an object of mingled horror and pity to his friends and relatives. I can see him now, with yellow, pasty face, drooping lids, and pin-point pupils, all huddled in a chair, the wreck and ruin of a noble man.\nOne night—it was in June, ’89—there came a ring to my bell, about the hour when a man gives his first yawn and glances at the clock. I sat up in my chair, and my wife laid her needle-work down in her lap and made a little face of disappointment.\n“A patient!” said she. “You’ll have to go out.”\nI groaned, for I was newly come back from a weary day.\nWe heard the door open, a few hurried words, and then quick steps upon the linoleum. Our own door flew open, and a lady, clad in some dark-coloured stuff, with a black veil, entered the room.\n“You will excuse my calling so late,” she began, and then, suddenly losing her self-control, she ran forward, threw her arms about my wife’s neck, and sobbed upon her shoulder. “Oh, I’m in such trouble!” she cried; “I do so want a little help.”\n“Why,” said my wife, pulling up her veil, “it is Kate Whitney. How you startled me, Kate! I had not an idea who you were when you came in.”\n“I didn’t know what to do, so I came straight to you.” That was always the way. Folk who were in grief came to my wife like birds to a lighthouse.\n“It was very sweet of you to come. Now, you must have some wine and water, and sit here comfortably and tell us all about it. Or should you rather that I sent James off to bed?”\n“Oh, no, no! I want the doctor’s advice and help, too. It’s about Isa. He has not been home for two days. I am so frightened about him!”\nIt was not the first time that she had spoken to us of her husband’s trouble, to me as a doctor, to my wife as an old friend and school companion. We soothed and comforted her by such words as we could find. Did she know where her husband was? Was it possible that we could bring him back to her?\nIt seems that it was. She had the surest information that of late he had, when the fit was on him, made use of an opium den in the farthest east of the City. Hitherto his orgies had always been confined to one day, and he had come back, twitching and shattered, in the evening. But now the spell had been upon him eight-and-forty hours, and he lay there, doubtless among the dregs of the docks, breathing in the poison or sleeping off the effects. There he was to be found, she was sure of it, at the Bar of Gold, in Upper Swandam Lane. But what was she to do? How could she, a young and timid woman, make her way into such a place and pluck her husband out from among the ruffians who surrounded him?\nThere was the case, and of course there was but one way out of it. Might I not escort her to this place? And then, as a second thought, why should she come at all? I was Isa Whitney’s medical adviser, and as such I had influence over him. I could manage it better if I were alone. I promised her on my word that I would send him home in a cab within two hours if he were indeed at the address which she had given me. And so in ten minutes I had left my armchair and cheery sitting-room behind me, and was speeding eastward in a hansom on a strange errand, as it seemed to me at the time, though the future only could show how strange it was to be.",
          "paraphrase_gemini-2.5-flash-preview-04-17": "Isa Whitney, the brother of the late Elias Whitney, a respected divinity school principal, was deeply addicted to opium. According to what I understood, this habit began as a foolish youthful prank during his college years. Influenced by reading De Quincey's accounts of his drug-induced visions, Isa apparently soaked his tobacco in laudanum hoping to replicate the experience. Like many others, he discovered that developing the habit was far easier than breaking it, and for numerous years, he remained enslaved to the drug, seen by his friends and family with a mix of fear and pity. I can still picture him: his face sallow and pasty, eyelids drooping, and pupils tiny pinpricks, slumped in a chair—a mere shell of the honorable man he once was. One evening in June of '89, as most people were preparing for bed, my doorbell rang. I sat up in my chair, and my wife put down her sewing, looking visibly disappointed. \"A patient!\" she exclaimed. \"You'll have to go out.\" I let out a sigh; I had just returned from an exhausting day. We heard the front door open, some hushed words, and then rapid footsteps across the floor. Our own door burst open, and a woman dressed in dark fabric and a black veil rushed into the room. \"Please excuse me calling so late,\" she started, before suddenly losing composure, running to my wife, throwing her arms around her neck, and crying on her shoulder. \"Oh, I'm in such difficulty!\" she wept; \"I desperately need some help.\" \"Why,\" said my wife, lifting the woman's veil, \"it's Kate Whitney. You gave me a shock, Kate! I had no idea it was you when you came in.\" \"I didn't know what else to do, so I came straight here.\" People in distress always seemed drawn to my wife, much like birds seeking a beacon. \"It was very kind of you to come. Now, you must have some diluted wine and make yourself comfortable here and tell us everything. Or would you prefer I sent James to bed?\" \"Oh, no, no! I need the doctor's help and advice, too. It's about Isa. He hasn't been home for two days. I am so worried about him!\" This wasn't the first occasion she had shared her husband's struggles with us – with me as his physician, and with my wife as a long-time friend and former schoolmate. We offered what words of reassurance and comfort we could. Did she know where her husband was? Was there a way we could help bring him back to her? Apparently, there was a possibility. She had reliable information that recently, when his addiction was strongest, he had been frequenting an opium den located in the furthest eastern part of the City. Previously, his drug use binges had lasted only a day, and he would return in the evening, shaking and worn out. But this time, the drug had held him captive for forty-eight hours, and he was likely still there, among the city's lowest inhabitants, either under the influence or recovering. She was certain he could be found at the Bar of Gold, on Upper Swandam Lane. But what could she possibly do? How could she, a young, fearful woman, venture into such a place and retrieve her husband from the dangerous people around him? That was the situation, and clearly, there was only one practical solution. Couldn't I accompany her to this place? And then, it occurred to me: why should she come along at all? I was Isa Whitney's doctor and held some influence over him. I could handle the situation more effectively on my own. I gave her my word that I would send him home in a cab within two hours if he was indeed at the address she had given me. And so, ten minutes later, I had left my comfortable armchair and cheerful sitting room behind me, heading eastwards in a hansom cab on what felt like an unusual errand at the time, though only the future would reveal just how unusual it would become.",

He picked up the habit during his college days, after reading about De Quincey's opium-induced dreams, and tried to mimic the experiences by soaking his tobacco with laudanum. Like many others, he found it far easier to become addicted than to break free, and he remained dependent on the drug for years, becoming someone his friends and family viewed with a mix of horror and sympathy. I still remember the sight of him: his complexion unhealthy and yellow, eyelids drooping, his pupils tiny, slumped in a chair, a shadow of the great man he once was.\n\nOne June night in 1889, just when I was about to relax for the evening, the doorbell unexpectedly rang. My wife, slightly disappointed to have our evening interrupted, guessed it was a patient. Soon after, a woman dressed in dark clothing and a black veil rushed into our room, apologizing for the late visit before breaking down in tears on my wife's shoulder. She revealed herself as Kate Whitney, surprised my wife didn’t recognize her at first, and explained she didn’t know where else to turn in her distress. People in trouble often sought my wife’s help.\n\nAfter giving Kate something to drink and encouraging her to relax, she admitted she was worried about Isa, who hadn’t come home for two days. This wasn’t the first time she’d come to us for support regarding her husband’s issues. We tried to reassure her and asked if she knew Isa’s whereabouts. \n\nKate explained that she had reliable information that lately, when Isa relapsed, he frequented an opium den on the east side of the city. Normally, these absences lasted only a day, but now he’d been missing for forty-eight hours, likely lying in a stupor among the unsavory patrons of the dockside den known as the Bar of Gold on Upper Swandam Lane. Kate was desperate but frightened to go alone into such a dangerous place to find him.\n\nIt was clear what needed to be done: I should go find Isa. In fact, as his doctor, I might be able to help him more effectively by myself. I assured Kate that if Isa was at that address, I would have him home in a cab within two hours. So, leaving my comfortable home behind, I set off in a cab eastward, little knowing just how unusual this errand would turn out to be."

          "text_segment": "But there was no great difficulty in the first stage of my adventure. Upper Swandam Lane is a vile alley lurking behind the high wharves which line the north side of the river to the east of London Bridge. Between a slop-shop and a gin-shop, approached by a steep flight of steps leading down to a black gap like the mouth of a cave, I found the den of which I was in search. Ordering my cab to wait, I passed down the steps, worn hollow in the centre by the ceaseless tread of drunken feet; and by the light of a flickering oil-lamp above the door I found the latch and made my way into a long, low room, thick and heavy with the brown opium smoke, and terraced with wooden berths, like the forecastle of an emigrant ship.\nThrough the gloom one could dimly catch a glimpse of bodies lying in strange fantastic poses, bowed shoulders, bent knees, heads thrown back, and chins pointing upward, with here and there a dark, lack-lustre eye turned upon the newcomer. Out of the black shadows there glimmered little red circles of light, now bright, now faint, as the burning poison waxed or waned in the bowls of the metal pipes. The most lay silent, but some muttered to themselves, and others talked together in a strange, low, monotonous voice, their conversation coming in gushes, and then suddenly tailing off into silence, each mumbling out his own thoughts and paying little heed to the words of his neighbour. At the farther end was a small brazier of burning charcoal, beside which on a three-legged wooden stool there sat a tall, thin old man, with his jaw resting upon his two fists, and his elbows upon his knees, staring into the fire.\nAs I entered, a sallow Malay attendant had hurried up with a pipe for me and a supply of the drug, beckoning me to an empty berth.\n“Thank you. I have not come to stay,” said I. “There is a friend of mine here, Mr. Isa Whitney, and I wish to speak with him.”\nThere was a movement and an exclamation from my right, and peering through the gloom, I saw Whitney, pale, haggard, and unkempt, staring out at me.\n“My God! It’s Watson,” said he. He was in a pitiable state of reaction, with every nerve in a twitter. “I say, Watson, what o’clock is it?”\n“Nearly eleven.”\n“Of what day?”\n“Of Friday, June 19th.”\n“Good heavens! I thought it was Wednesday. It is Wednesday. What d’you want to frighten a chap for?” He sank his face onto his arms and began to sob in a high treble key.\n“I tell you that it is Friday, man. Your wife has been waiting this two days for you. You should be ashamed of yourself!”\n“So I am. But you’ve got mixed, Watson, for I have only been here a few hours, three pipes, four pipes—I forget how many. But I’ll go home with you. I wouldn’t frighten Kate—poor little Kate. Give me your hand! Have you a cab?”\n“Yes, I have one waiting.”\n“Then I shall go in it. But I must owe something. Find what I owe, Watson. I am all off colour. I can do nothing for myself.”\nI walked down the narrow passage between the double row of sleepers, holding my breath to keep out the vile, stupefying fumes of the drug, and looking about for the manager. As I passed the tall man who sat by the brazier I felt a sudden pluck at my skirt, and a low voice whispered, “Walk past me, and then look back at me.” The words fell quite distinctly upon my ear. I glanced down. They could only have come from the old man at my side, and yet he sat now as absorbed as ever, very thin, very wrinkled, bent with age, an opium pipe dangling down from between his knees, as though it had dropped in sheer lassitude from his fingers. I took two steps forward and looked back. It took all my self-control to prevent me from breaking out into a cry of astonishment. He had turned his back so that none could see him but I. His form had filled out, his wrinkles were gone, the dull eyes had regained their fire, and there, sitting by the fire and grinning at my surprise, was none other than Sherlock Holmes. He made a slight motion to me to approach him, and instantly, as he turned his face half round to the company once more, subsided into a doddering, loose-lipped senility.\n“Holmes!” I whispered, “what on earth are you doing in this den?”\n“As low as you can,” he answered; “I have excellent ears. If you would have the great kindness to get rid of that sottish friend of yours I should be exceedingly glad to have a little talk with you.”\n“I have a cab outside.”\n“Then pray send him home in it. You may safely trust him, for he appears to be too limp to get into any mischief. I should recommend you also to send a note by the cabman to your wife to say that you have thrown in your lot with me. If you will wait outside, I shall be with you in five minutes.”",
          "paraphrase_gemini-2.5-flash-preview-04-17": "My entry into the area wasn't overly difficult. Upper Swandam Lane is a seedy passageway hidden behind the large docks lining the river's northern bank, east of London Bridge. Situated between a cheap clothing store and a bar, accessible via a steep staircase descending into a dark void resembling a cave entrance, I located the establishment I was seeking. Instructing my hired carriage to wait, I descended the steps, whose centres were worn hollow from the constant traffic of unsteady feet. Guided by the light of a flickering oil lamp above the doorway, I found the latch and entered a lengthy, low-ceilinged room. The air was thick and heavy with brown opium smoke, and the space was lined with wooden bunks, much like the sleeping quarters on an immigrant vessel.\nIn the dim light, one could faintly discern figures sprawled in peculiar, twisted postures – slumped shoulders, bent knees, heads tilted back with chins raised, and occasionally a dark, lifeless eye fixated on the newcomer. From the deep shadows, tiny red glows appeared, sometimes bright, sometimes dim, as the burning drug waxed and waned in the metal pipe bowls. Most occupants were silent, though some murmured to themselves, while others conversed in strange, hushed, monotonous tones. Their talk came in bursts, then abruptly faded into silence, each person lost in their own thoughts, paying little attention to their neighbours. At the far end of the room, a small charcoal brazier burned. Beside it, on a three-legged wooden stool, sat a tall, gaunt elderly man, his jaw resting on his closed fists, his elbows on his knees, staring into the flames.\nUpon my arrival, a pale-complexioned Malay attendant swiftly approached me with a pipe and a portion of the drug, gesturing towards an empty bunk.\n“Thank you, but I’m not staying,” I replied. “A friend of mine, Mr. Isa Whitney, is here, and I need to speak with him.”\nA stir and an exclamation came from my right. Peering through the gloom, I saw Whitney, looking pallid, exhausted, and dishevelled, gazing back at me.\n“Good heavens! It’s Watson,” he exclaimed. He was clearly suffering from a severe after-effect, every nerve twitching. “Watson, please, what time is it?”\n“Almost eleven.”\n“What day is it?”\n“It’s Friday, June 19th.”\n“Impossible! I believed it was Wednesday. It *is* Wednesday. Why are you trying to alarm me?” He dropped his face into his arms and began sobbing in a high-pitched wail.\n“I assure you, it is Friday, man. Your wife has been awaiting your return for two days. You ought to feel utterly ashamed!”\n“I do. But you’re mistaken, Watson, as I’ve only been here for a few hours, perhaps three or four pipes – I can’t recall how many. But I will come home with you. I wouldn’t want to distress Kate – poor little Kate. Give me your hand! Did you arrive by cab?”\n“Yes, I have one waiting.”\n“Then I’ll ride in it. But I must settle my debt. Find out what I owe, Watson. I feel completely unwell. I can’t manage anything myself.”\nI walked down the narrow passage separating the two rows of sleeping figures, holding my breath to avoid inhaling the foul, intoxicating fumes of the drug, and scanning for the manager. As I passed the tall man seated by the brazier, I felt a sudden tug on my coat. A low voice whispered, “Keep walking past me, then look back.” The words reached my ears with perfect clarity. I glanced down. They could only have originated from the old man beside me, yet he sat there seemingly as lost in contemplation as before, extremely thin, deeply wrinkled, bent with age, an opium pipe dangling between his knees as if it had slipped from his fingers from sheer exhaustion. I took two steps forward and turned to look back. It required all my self-control to suppress a gasp of utter astonishment. He had turned away so that only I could see him. His physique had filled out, his wrinkles had vanished, the dull eyes were now alight with energy, and there, sitting by the fire and grinning at my bewildered reaction, was none other than Sherlock Holmes. He made a subtle signal for me to approach him. Instantly, as he partially turned his face back towards the general company, he reverted to the appearance of a feeble, slack-jawed old man.\n“Holmes!” I whispered, “What on earth are you doing here in this dreadful place?”\n“Speak as quietly as possible,” he replied; “My hearing is excellent. If you could do me the great favour of getting rid of your intoxicated friend, I would be exceedingly grateful for a short conversation with you.”\n“I have a cab waiting outside.”\n“Excellent. Please send him home in it. You can safely rely on him; he seems too incapacitated to cause any trouble. I also suggest you send a note with the cabman to your wife, informing her that you have decided to stay with me. If you wait just outside, I will join you within five minutes.”",
          "paraphrase_gpt-4.1-2025-04-14": "The initial phase of my undertaking was not particularly challenging. Upper Swandam Lane, a wretched backstreet hidden behind the tall docks on the north bank of the river, east of London Bridge, was my destination. Between a secondhand clothing shop and a gin bar, accessible by a steep set of stairs descending into a shadowy chasm, I discovered the establishment I sought. I told my cab to wait and walked down the steps, their centers hollowed by the constant passage of drunken feet; illuminated by a flickering oil-lamp, I located the latch and entered a long, low room filled with thick, brown opium smoke and lined with wooden bunks, reminiscent of a ship's forecastle. \n\nIn the dimness, figures could be seen sprawled in odd, contorted postures—slumped shoulders, bent knees, heads tossed back, chins up—with an occasional flat, dull gaze turned in my direction. In the darkness, small red glows flared or dimmed as the drug's fire rose and fell in metal pipes. Most occupants were silent, though some muttered or conversed in monotone bursts, their scattered talk trailing off into further mumbling, each lost in his own world. At the far end, a small charcoal brazier burned. Next to it, perched on a three-legged stool, was a tall, thin elderly man, chin on fists and elbows on knees, staring into the flames.\n\nAs I entered, a sallow-skinned Malay attendant quickly brought me a pipe and some opium, motioning to a vacant bunk.\n\n“No, thank you. I’m not here to stay,” I told him. “I’m looking for a friend—Mr. Isa Whitney—whom I need to speak to.”\n\nThere was a stir and an exclamation to my right. Peering through the gloom, I recognized Whitney, looking gaunt, unkempt, and pale, staring at me.\n\n“My God, Watson!” he cried, in a wretched state, visibly twitchy and agitated. “Watson, do you know the time?”\n\n“Almost eleven.”\n\n“The day?”\n\n“Friday, June 19th.”\n\n“Heavens! I thought it was Wednesday. You’re just trying to scare me. It is Wednesday!” He buried his face in his arms and began to sob.\n\n“I assure you, it’s Friday. Your wife’s been waiting for you for two days. Aren’t you ashamed?”\n\n“I am, but you’re mistaken, Watson. I’ve not been here long—a few pipes, maybe. But I’ll come home now. I wouldn’t want to frighten Kate. Give me your hand—do you have a cab?”\n\n“Yes, it’s waiting.”\n\n“Then I’ll go. But I must settle my bill. Find out what I owe, Watson. I can’t manage it myself.”\n\nI made my way down the narrow aisle between bunks, trying not to breathe in the foul opium fumes, looking for the manager. As I passed the tall man by the brazier, I suddenly felt a tug at my coat and heard a low voice: “Walk past me, then look back.” The words were very clear. Glancing down, I realized they came from the old man beside me, though he still appeared lost in thought, pipe hanging between his knees as if dropped from exhaustion. I took two steps, then looked back. It took all my willpower not to gasp in shock—the man had transformed, appearing younger and alert, his eyes bright. It was Sherlock Holmes himself, grinning at my reaction. He subtly motioned me over, and as he turned again to face the room, he resumed the act of decrepit old age.\n\n“Holmes!” I whispered. “What on earth are you doing here?”\n\n“Quietly,” he replied. “I can hear everything. Could you please get rid of your friend? I’d like to talk.”\n\n“There’s a cab outside.”\n\n“Please send him home in it, and perhaps also have the driver take a note to your wife so she knows you’re with me. Wait outside—I’ll join you in five minutes.”"

          "text_segment": "It was difficult to refuse any of Sherlock Holmes’ requests, for they were always so exceedingly definite, and put forward with such a quiet air of mastery. I felt, however, that when Whitney was once confined in the cab my mission was practically accomplished; and for the rest, I could not wish anything better than to be associated with my friend in one of those singular adventures which were the normal condition of his existence. In a few minutes I had written my note, paid Whitney’s bill, led him out to the cab, and seen him driven through the darkness. In a very short time a decrepit figure had emerged from the opium den, and I was walking down the street with Sherlock Holmes. For two streets he shuffled along with a bent back and an uncertain foot. Then, glancing quickly round, he straightened himself out and burst into a hearty fit of laughter.\n“I suppose, Watson,” said he, “that you imagine that I have added opium-smoking to cocaine injections, and all the other little weaknesses on which you have favoured me with your medical views.”\n“I was certainly surprised to find you there.”\n“But not more so than I to find you.”\n“I came to find a friend.”\n“And I to find an enemy.”\n“An enemy?”\n“Yes; one of my natural enemies, or, shall I say, my natural prey. Briefly, Watson, I am in the midst of a very remarkable inquiry, and I have hoped to find a clue in the incoherent ramblings of these sots, as I have done before now. Had I been recognised in that den my life would not have been worth an hour’s purchase; for I have used it before now for my own purposes, and the rascally Lascar who runs it has sworn to have vengeance upon me. There is a trap-door at the back of that building, near the corner of Paul’s Wharf, which could tell some strange tales of what has passed through it upon the moonless nights.”\n“What! You do not mean bodies?”\n“Ay, bodies, Watson. We should be rich men if we had £ 1000 for every poor devil who has been done to death in that den. It is the vilest murder-trap on the whole riverside, and I fear that Neville St. Clair has entered it never to leave it more. But our trap should be here.” He put his two forefingers between his teeth and whistled shrilly—a signal which was answered by a similar whistle from the distance, followed shortly by the rattle of wheels and the clink of horses’ hoofs.\n“Now, Watson,” said Holmes, as a tall dog-cart dashed up through the gloom, throwing out two golden tunnels of yellow light from its side lanterns. “You’ll come with me, won’t you?”\n“If I can be of use.”\n“Oh, a trusty comrade is always of use; and a chronicler still more so. My room at The Cedars is a double-bedded one.”\n“The Cedars?”\n“Yes; that is Mr. St. Clair’s house. I am staying there while I conduct the inquiry.”\n“Where is it, then?”\n“Near Lee, in Kent. We have a seven-mile drive before us.”\n“But I am all in the dark.”\n“Of course you are. You’ll know all about it presently. Jump up here. All right, John; we shall not need you. Here’s half a crown. Look out for me to-morrow, about eleven. Give her her head. So long, then!”\nHe flicked the horse with his whip, and we dashed away through the endless succession of sombre and deserted streets, which widened gradually, until we were flying across a broad balustraded bridge, with the murky river flowing sluggishly beneath us. Beyond lay another dull wilderness of bricks and mortar, its silence broken only by the heavy, regular footfall of the policeman, or the songs and shouts of some belated party of revellers. A dull wrack was drifting slowly across the sky, and a star or two twinkled dimly here and there through the rifts of the clouds. Holmes drove in silence, with his head sunk upon his breast, and the air of a man who is lost in thought, while I sat beside him, curious to learn what this new quest might be which seemed to tax his powers so sorely, and yet afraid to break in upon the current of his thoughts. We had driven several miles, and were beginning to get to the fringe of the belt of suburban villas, when he shook himself, shrugged his shoulders, and lit up his pipe with the air of a man who has satisfied himself that he is acting for the best.\n“You have a grand gift of silence, Watson,” said he. “It makes you quite invaluable as a companion. ’Pon my word, it is a great thing for me to have someone to talk to, for my own thoughts are not over-pleasant. I was wondering what I should say to this dear little woman to-night when she meets me at the door.”\n“You forget that I know nothing about it.”\n“I shall just have time to tell you the facts of the case before we get to Lee. It seems absurdly simple, and yet, somehow I can get nothing to go upon. There’s plenty of thread, no doubt, but I can’t get the end of it into my hand. Now, I’ll state the case clearly and concisely to you, Watson, and maybe you can see a spark where all is dark to me.”\n“Proceed, then.”\n“Some years ago—to be definite, in May, 1884—there came to Lee a gentleman, Neville St. Clair by name, who appeared to have plenty of money. He took a large villa, laid out the grounds very nicely, and lived generally in good style. By degrees he made friends in the neighbourhood, and in 1887 he married the daughter of a local brewer, by whom he now has two children. He had no occupation, but was interested in several companies and went into town as a rule in the morning, returning by the 5:14 from Cannon Street every night. Mr. St. Clair is now thirty-seven years of age, is a man of temperate habits, a good husband, a very affectionate father, and a man who is popular with all who know him. I may add that his whole debts at the present moment, as far as we have been able to ascertain, amount to £ 88 10s., while he has £ 220 standing to his credit in the Capital and Counties Bank. There is no reason, therefore, to think that money troubles have been weighing upon his mind.\n“Last Monday Mr. Neville St. Clair went into town rather earlier than usual, remarking before he started that he had two important commissions to perform, and that he would bring his little boy home a box of bricks. Now, by the merest chance, his wife received a telegram upon this same Monday, very shortly after his departure, to the effect that a small parcel of considerable value which she had been expecting was waiting for her at the offices of the Aberdeen Shipping Company. Now, if you are well up in your London, you will know that the office of the company is in Fresno Street, which branches out of Upper Swandam Lane, where you found me to-night. Mrs. St. Clair had her lunch, started for the City, did some shopping, proceeded to the company’s office, got her packet, and found herself at exactly 4:35 walking through Swandam Lane on her way back to the station. Have you followed me so far?”\n“It is very clear.”\n“If you remember, Monday was an exceedingly hot day, and Mrs. St. Clair walked slowly, glancing about in the hope of seeing a cab, as she did not like the neighbourhood in which she found herself. While she was walking in this way down Swandam Lane, she suddenly heard an ejaculation or cry, and was struck cold to see her husband looking down at her and, as it seemed to her, beckoning to her from a second-floor window. The window was open, and she distinctly saw his face, which she describes as being terribly agitated. He waved his hands frantically to her, and then vanished from the window so suddenly that it seemed to her that he had been plucked back by some irresistible force from behind. One singular point which struck her quick feminine eye was that although he wore some dark coat, such as he had started to town in, he had on neither collar nor necktie.\n“Convinced that something was amiss with him, she rushed down the steps—for the house was none other than the opium den in which you found me to-night—and running through the front room she attempted to ascend the stairs which led to the first floor. At the foot of the stairs, however, she met this Lascar scoundrel of whom I have spoken, who thrust her back and, aided by a Dane, who acts as assistant there, pushed her out into the street. Filled with the most maddening doubts and fears, she rushed down the lane and, by rare good-fortune, met in Fresno Street a number of constables with an inspector, all on their way to their beat. The inspector and two men accompanied her back, and in spite of the continued resistance of the proprietor, they made their way to the room in which Mr. St. Clair had last been seen. There was no sign of him there. In fact, in the whole of that floor there was no one to be found save a crippled wretch of hideous aspect, who, it seems, made his home there. Both he and the Lascar stoutly swore that no one else had been in the front room during the afternoon. So determined was their denial that the inspector was staggered, and had almost come to believe that Mrs. St. Clair had been deluded when, with a cry, she sprang at a small deal box which lay upon the table and tore the lid from it. Out there fell a cascade of children’s bricks. It was the toy which he had promised to bring home.\n“This discovery, and the evident confusion which the cripple showed, made the inspector realise that the matter was serious. The rooms were carefully examined, and results all pointed to an abominable crime. The front room was plainly furnished as a sitting-room and led into a small bedroom, which looked out upon the back of one of the wharves. Between the wharf and the bedroom window is a narrow strip, which is dry at low tide but is covered at high tide with at least four and a half feet of water. The bedroom window was a broad one and opened from below. On examination traces of blood were to be seen upon the windowsill, and several scattered drops were visible upon the wooden floor of the bedroom. Thrust away behind a curtain in the front room were all the clothes of Mr. Neville St. Clair, with the exception of his coat. His boots, his socks, his hat, and his watch—all were there. There were no signs of violence upon any of these garments, and there were no other traces of Mr. Neville St. Clair. Out of the window he must apparently have gone for no other exit could be discovered, and the ominous bloodstains upon the sill gave little promise that he could save himself by swimming, for the tide was at its very highest at the moment of the tragedy.\n“And now as to the villains who seemed to be immediately implicated in the matter. The Lascar was known to be a man of the vilest antecedents, but as, by Mrs. St. Clair’s story, he was known to have been at the foot of the stair within a very few seconds of her husband’s appearance at the window, he could hardly have been more than an accessory to the crime. His defence was one of absolute ignorance, and he protested that he had no knowledge as to the doings of Hugh Boone, his lodger, and that he could not account in any way for the presence of the missing gentleman’s clothes.\n“So much for the Lascar manager. Now for the sinister cripple who lives upon the second floor of the opium den, and who was certainly the last human being whose eyes rested upon Neville St. Clair. His name is Hugh Boone, and his hideous face is one which is familiar to every man who goes much to the City. He is a professional beggar, though in order to avoid the police regulations he pretends to a small trade in wax vestas. Some little distance down Threadneedle Street, upon the left-hand side, there is, as you may have remarked, a small angle in the wall. Here it is that this creature takes his daily seat, cross-legged with his tiny stock of matches on his lap, and as he is a piteous spectacle a small rain of charity descends into the greasy leather cap which lies upon the pavement beside him. I have watched the fellow more than once before ever I thought of making his professional acquaintance, and I have been surprised at the harvest which he has reaped in a short time. His appearance, you see, is so remarkable that no one can pass him without observing him. A shock of orange hair, a pale face disfigured by a horrible scar, which, by its contraction, has turned up the outer edge of his upper lip, a bulldog chin, and a pair of very penetrating dark eyes, which present a singular contrast to the colour of his hair, all mark him out from amid the common crowd of mendicants and so, too, does his wit, for he is ever ready with a reply to any piece of chaff which may be thrown at him by the passers-by. This is the man whom we now learn to have been the lodger at the opium den, and to have been the last man to see the gentleman of whom we are in quest.”\n“But a cripple!” said I. “What could he have done single-handed against a man in the prime of life?”\n“He is a cripple in the sense that he walks with a limp; but in other respects he appears to be a powerful and well-nurtured man. Surely your medical experience would tell you, Watson, that weakness in one limb is often compensated for by exceptional strength in the others.”\n“Pray continue your narrative.”\n“Mrs. St. Clair had fainted at the sight of the blood upon the window, and she was escorted home in a cab by the police, as her presence could be of no help to them in their investigations. Inspector Barton, who had charge of the case, made a very careful examination of the premises, but without finding anything which threw any light upon the matter. One mistake had been made in not arresting Boone instantly, as he was allowed some few minutes during which he might have communicated with his friend the Lascar, but this fault was soon remedied, and he was seized and searched, without anything being found which could incriminate him. There were, it is true, some blood-stains upon his right shirt-sleeve, but he pointed to his ring-finger, which had been cut near the nail, and explained that the bleeding came from there, adding that he had been to the window not long before, and that the stains which had been observed there came doubtless from the same source. He denied strenuously having ever seen Mr. Neville St. Clair and swore that the presence of the clothes in his room was as much a mystery to him as to the police. As to Mrs. St. Clair’s assertion that she had actually seen her husband at the window, he declared that she must have been either mad or dreaming. He was removed, loudly protesting, to the police-station, while the inspector remained upon the premises in the hope that the ebbing tide might afford some fresh clue.\n“And it did, though they hardly found upon the mud-bank what they had feared to find. It was Neville St. Clair’s coat, and not Neville St. Clair, which lay uncovered as the tide receded. And what do you think they found in the pockets?”\n“I cannot imagine.”\n“No, I don’t think you would guess. Every pocket stuffed with pennies and half-pennies—421 pennies and 270 half-pennies. It was no wonder that it had not been swept away by the tide. But a human body is a different matter. There is a fierce eddy between the wharf and the house. It seemed likely enough that the weighted coat had remained when the stripped body had been sucked away into the river.”\n“But I understand that all the other clothes were found in the room. Would the body be dressed in a coat alone?”\n“No, sir, but the facts might be met speciously enough. Suppose that this man Boone had thrust Neville St. Clair through the window, there is no human eye which could have seen the deed. What would he do then? It would of course instantly strike him that he must get rid of the tell-tale garments. He would seize the coat, then, and be in the act of throwing it out, when it would occur to him that it would swim and not sink. He has little time, for he has heard the scuffle downstairs when the wife tried to force her way up, and perhaps he has already heard from his Lascar confederate that the police are hurrying up the street. There is not an instant to be lost. He rushes to some secret hoard, where he has accumulated the fruits of his beggary, and he stuffs all the coins upon which he can lay his hands into the pockets to make sure of the coat’s sinking. He throws it out, and would have done the same with the other garments had not he heard the rush of steps below, and only just had time to close the window when the police appeared.”\n“It certainly sounds feasible.”\n“Well, we will take it as a working hypothesis for want of a better. Boone, as I have told you, was arrested and taken to the station, but it could not be shown that there had ever before been anything against him. He had for years been known as a professional beggar, but his life appeared to have been a very quiet and innocent one. There the matter stands at present, and the questions which have to be solved—what Neville St. Clair was doing in the opium den, what happened to him when there, where is he now, and what Hugh Boone had to do with his disappearance—are all as far from a solution as ever. I confess that I cannot recall any case within my experience which looked at the first glance so simple and yet which presented such difficulties.”",
          "paraphrase_gemini-2.5-flash-preview-04-17": "It was hard to decline any request from Sherlock Holmes, as they were always so precise and delivered with such an air of authority. However, I felt that once Whitney was secured in the cab, my task was essentially complete. As for the rest, I was more than happy to join my friend in one of those unusual investigations that were a regular part of his life. Within minutes, I had written my note, settled Whitney’s fare, escorted him to the taxi, and watched it drive away into the night. Soon after, a frail-looking figure emerged from the opium den, and I was walking down the street with Sherlock Holmes. For a couple of blocks, he shuffled along, bent over with an unsteady gait. Then, with a quick glance around, he stood straight up and burst into hearty laughter.\n\n“I suppose, Watson,” he remarked, “you think I’ve added opium-smoking to cocaine injections and all the other minor vices you’ve shared your medical opinions on.”\n\n“I admit I was surprised to find you there.”\n\n“But no more surprised than I was to find you.”\n\n“I came to find a friend.”\n\n“And I to find an enemy.”\n\n“An enemy?”\n\n“Yes; one of my natural adversaries, or perhaps, my natural quarry. In short, Watson, I’m deeply involved in a very unusual case, and I’d hoped to gather information from the rambling talk of these addicts, as I’ve done before. If I had been recognized in that place, my life wouldn’t have been worth much; I’ve used it for my own purposes before, and the villainous Lascar who runs it has sworn revenge on me. There’s a trap-door at the rear of that building, near the corner of Paul’s Wharf, that could tell some strange stories of what has passed through it on moonless nights.”\n\n“What! You don’t mean bodies?”\n\n“Indeed, bodies, Watson. We’d be wealthy men if we had £1000 for every poor wretch murdered in that den. It is the most terrible murder-trap along the entire riverside, and I fear Neville St. Clair has entered it never to return. But our rendezvous should be here.” He put his index fingers to his mouth and whistled loudly—a signal answered by a similar whistle from the distance, soon followed by the sound of wheels and horse hooves.\n\n“Now, Watson,” said Holmes, as a tall dog-cart swiftly approached through the darkness, its side lanterns casting two golden beams of light. “You’ll come with me, won’t you?”\n\n“If I can be of assistance.”\n\n“Oh, a reliable companion is always useful; and a chronicler even more so. My room at The Cedars has two beds.”\n\n“The Cedars?”\n\n“Yes; that is Mr. St. Clair’s residence. I am staying there while I conduct the investigation.”\n\n“Where is it located?”\n\n“Near Lee, in Kent. We have a seven-mile journey ahead of us.”\n\n“But I’m completely uninformed.”\n\n“Naturally you are. You’ll learn all about it soon. Hop in. Alright, John; we won’t require you. Here’s half a crown. Expect me tomorrow, around eleven. Give her her head. Farewell for now!”\n\nHe lightly whipped the horse, and we sped away through an unending series of grim and deserted streets, which gradually widened until we were racing across a wide bridge with balustrades, the murky river flowing sluggishly beneath us. Beyond lay another drab expanse of buildings, its quiet broken only by the heavy, rhythmic tread of a policeman, or the songs and shouts of some late group of revelers. A dull layer of clouds was slowly moving across the sky, and a star or two twinkled faintly through gaps in the gloom. Holmes drove in silence, his head bowed, looking like a man lost in thought, while I sat beside him, curious about this new case that seemed to challenge him so much, yet hesitant to interrupt his reflections. We had travelled several miles and were beginning to reach the outskirts of the suburban villas when he roused himself, shrugged his shoulders, and lit his pipe with the air of a man satisfied that he was doing the right thing.\n\n“You have a wonderful ability for silence, Watson,” he said. “It makes you truly invaluable as a companion. Honestly, it’s a great comfort for me to have someone to talk to, as my own thoughts are not very pleasant. I was just wondering what I should say to this poor lady tonight when she meets me at the door.”\n\n“You forget that I know nothing at all about it.”\n\n“I’ll have just enough time to tell you the facts of the case before we reach Lee. It seems incredibly straightforward, and yet, somehow I can find no progress. There’s plenty of information, certainly, but I can’t find the crucial point to grasp. Now, I’ll lay out the case clearly and concisely for you, Watson, and perhaps you can see a spark where everything is dark to me.”\n\n“Please proceed.”\n\n“Some years ago—specifically, in May 1884—a gentleman named Neville St. Clair arrived in Lee, who appeared to have considerable wealth. He rented a large villa, beautifully landscaped the grounds, and generally lived in comfort. Gradually, he became friendly with people in the area, and in 1887 he married the daughter of a local brewer, with whom he now has two children. He had no formal profession but invested in several companies and typically went into the city in the morning, returning on the 5:14 train from Cannon Street each evening. Mr. St. Clair is now thirty-seven years old, is a man of moderate habits, a good husband, a very loving father, and well-liked by everyone who knows him. I might add that his total debts at present, as far as we have determined, amount to £88 10s., while he has £220 in his account at the Capital and Counties Bank. There is no reason, therefore, to believe that financial worries were troubling him.\n\n“Last Monday, Mr. Neville St. Clair went into the city earlier than usual, mentioning before he left that he had two important tasks to complete and that he would bring his little boy home a box of building blocks. Now, by sheer coincidence, his wife received a telegram that same Monday, very soon after his departure, stating that a small package of significant value which she had been expecting was waiting for her at the offices of the Aberdeen Shipping Company. Now, if you are familiar with London, you will know that the company’s office is in Fresno Street, which branches off Upper Swandam Lane, where you found me tonight. Mrs. St. Clair had her lunch, set out for the City, did some shopping, went to the company’s office, collected her package, and found herself at precisely 4:35 walking through Swandam Lane on her way back to the station. Have you followed me so far?”\n\n“It is very clear.”\n\n“If you recall, Monday was an extremely hot day, and Mrs. St. Clair walked slowly, looking around in the hope of finding a cab, as she did not like the neighbourhood she was in. While she was walking in this manner down Swandam Lane, she suddenly heard an exclamation or cry, and was frozen with fear to see her husband looking down at her and, as it seemed to her, signaling to her from a second-floor window. The window was open, and she clearly saw his face, which she describes as being terribly distressed. He waved his hands frantically at her, and then vanished from the window so abruptly that it seemed to her he had been forcibly pulled back from behind. One notable detail that caught her sharp female eye was that although he wore a dark coat, similar to the one he left home in, he had on neither a collar nor a necktie.\n\n“Convinced that something was seriously wrong with him, she rushed down the steps—for the building was none other than the opium den where you found me tonight—and running through the front room, she attempted to go up the stairs to the first floor. At the bottom of the stairs, however, she encountered this Lascar villain I mentioned, who shoved her back and, assisted by a Dane who works there as an assistant, pushed her out into the street. Filled with the most agonizing doubts and fears, she hurried down the lane and, by rare good fortune, met in Fresno Street a group of constables with an inspector, all heading to their patrol area. The inspector and two men accompanied her back, and despite the continued resistance of the owner, they made their way to the room where Mr. St. Clair had last been seen. There was no trace of him there. In fact, throughout that entire floor, no one was found except a disabled man of repulsive appearance, who apparently lived there. Both he and the Lascar vehemently denied that anyone else had been in the front room that afternoon. Their denial was so determined that the inspector was taken aback, and had almost come to believe that Mrs. St. Clair was mistaken when, with a cry, she lunged at a small wooden box lying on the table and tore the lid off. Out fell a cascade of children’s building blocks. It was the toy he had promised to bring home.\n\n“This discovery, and the visible confusion shown by the disabled man, made the inspector realize the matter was serious. The rooms were thoroughly searched, and the findings all suggested a dreadful crime. The front room was simply furnished as a sitting-room and led into a small bedroom, which overlooked the back of one of the wharves. Between the wharf and the bedroom window is a narrow strip, which is dry at low tide but covered at high tide by at least four and a half feet of water. The bedroom window was wide and opened upwards. On examination, traces of blood were visible on the windowsill, and several scattered drops were seen on the wooden floor of the bedroom. Tucked away behind a curtain in the front room were all of Mr. Neville St. Clair’s clothes, except his coat. His boots, his socks, his hat, and his watch—all were there. There were no signs of violence on any of these items, and no other traces of Mr. Neville St. Clair. He must apparently have gone out of the window, as no other exit could be found, and the ominous bloodstains on the sill offered little hope that he could save himself by swimming, as the tide was at its highest point at the time of the incident.\n\n“And now concerning the culprits who seem directly involved in the affair. The Lascar was known to have a terrible past, but since, according to Mrs. St. Clair’s account, he was at the foot of the stairs within moments of her husband appearing at the window, he could hardly have been more than an accomplice. His defence was one of total ignorance, and he insisted he knew nothing about the activities of Hugh Boone, his lodger, and could not explain the presence of the missing gentleman’s clothes in any way.\n\n“So much for the Lascar manager. Now for the sinister disabled man who resides on the second floor of the opium den, and who was certainly the last person whose eyes rested upon Neville St. Clair. His name is Hugh Boone, and his dreadful face is recognizable to everyone who spends time in the City. He is a professional beggar, although to avoid police regulations, he pretends to sell wax matches. A short distance down Threadneedle Street, on the left side, there is, as you may have noticed, a small indentation in the wall. Here it is that this creature takes his daily position, sitting cross-legged with his small stock of matches on his lap, and as he is a pitiful sight, a small flow of donations descends into the greasy leather cap lying on the pavement beside him. I have observed the fellow more than once before I ever considered becoming professionally acquainted with him, and I have been surprised at the money he collects in a short time. His appearance, you see, is so striking that no one can pass him without noticing him. A mass of orange hair, a pale face marred by a terrible scar which, by contracting, has pulled up the outer edge of his upper lip, a strong jaw, and a pair of very sharp dark eyes which contrast remarkably with his hair colour, all distinguish him from the usual crowd of beggars and so, too, does his cleverness, for he is always ready with a witty response to any teasing from passers-by. This is the man we now know to have been lodging at the opium den, and to have been the last person to see the gentleman we are searching for.”\n\n“But a disabled man!” I said. “What could he have done alone against a man in his prime?”\n\n“He is disabled in the sense that he walks with a limp; but in other respects, he appears to be a powerful and well-built man. Surely your medical knowledge would tell you, Watson, that a weakness in one limb is often compensated for by unusual strength in the others.”\n\n“Please continue your story.”\n\n“Mrs. St. Clair had fainted at the sight of the blood on the window, and she was escorted home in a cab by the police, as her presence could be of no help to them in their investigation. Inspector Barton, who was in charge of the case, conducted a very thorough search of the premises, but without finding anything that shed any light on the matter. One error was made in not arresting Boone immediately, as he was allowed a few minutes during which he might have communicated with his friend the Lascar, but this mistake was quickly corrected, and he was apprehended and searched, without anything being found that could implicate him. There were, it is true, some bloodstains on his right shirt-sleeve, but he pointed to his ring-finger, which had been cut near the nail, and explained that the bleeding came from there, adding that he had been to the window not long before, and that the stains seen there undoubtedly came from the same source. He strongly denied ever having seen Mr. Neville St. Clair and swore that the presence of the clothes in his room was as baffling to him as to the police. As for Mrs. St. Clair’s claim that she had actually seen her husband at the window, he declared that she must have been either insane or dreaming. He was taken, loudly protesting, to the police-station, while the inspector remained on the premises in the hope that the outgoing tide might reveal some new clue.\n\n“And it did, though they hardly found upon the mud-bank what they had feared to find. It was Neville St. Clair’s coat, and not Neville St. Clair, which lay exposed as the tide went out. And what do you think they found in the pockets?”\n\n“I cannot imagine.”\n\n“No, I don’t think you would guess. Every pocket was crammed with pennies and half-pennies—421 pennies and 270 half-pennies. It was no surprise that it had not been carried away by the tide. But a human body is a different matter. There is a strong current between the wharf and the house. It seemed quite likely that the weighted coat had remained while the unclothed body had been swept away into the river.”\n\n“But I understand that all the other clothes were found in the room. Would the body have been dressed only in a coat?”\n\n“No, sir, but the circumstances could be explained plausibly enough. Suppose that this man Boone had pushed Neville St. Clair through the window, there is no human eye that could have witnessed the act. What would he do then? It would immediately occur to him, of course, that he must get rid of the incriminating garments. He would grab the coat, then, and be in the process of throwing it out, when it would strike him that it would float and not sink. He has little time, for he has heard the commotion downstairs when the wife tried to force her way up, and perhaps he has already learned from his Lascar accomplice that the police are hurrying down the street. There is not a moment to lose. He rushes to some hidden store, where he has collected the proceeds of his begging, and he stuffs all the coins he can get his hands on into the pockets to ensure the coat sinks. He throws it out, and would have done the same with the other clothes had he not heard the sound of footsteps below, and only just had time to close the window when the police arrived.”\n\n“It certainly sounds plausible.”\n\n“Well, we will accept that as a working theory for lack of a better one. Boone, as I told you, was arrested and taken to the station, but it could not be shown that he had ever had any previous record. He had been known as a professional beggar for years, but his life appeared to have been very quiet and harmless. There the matter stands at present, and the questions that must be answered—what Neville St. Clair was doing in the opium den, what happened to him there, where is he now, and what Hugh Boone had to do with his disappearance—are all as far from a resolution as ever. I admit that I cannot recall any case in my experience which at first glance seemed so simple and yet presented such difficulties.”",
          "paraphrase_gpt-4.1-2025-04-14": "Sherlock Holmes was difficult to refuse because his requests were always clear and showed a quiet confidence. Still, once my friend Whitney was secured in a cab, I felt my immediate duty was done, and I was eager to accompany Holmes on another of his unusual adventures. I quickly wrote a note, paid Whitney’s bill, and saw him off before rejoining Holmes, who had emerged in disguise from the opium den. As we walked, Holmes maintained a hunched, feeble posture for two blocks, then straightened and laughed heartily, teasing me about the possibility that I suspected him of adding opium to his other vices. He explained that I wasn’t the only surprised one—he had come seeking an enemy, not a friend. Holmes was in the midst of an intriguing investigation and hoped to find a clue among the rambling addicts. He revealed that the Lascar running the den bore him a grudge, making the place dangerous, and hinted at sinister deeds committed there, including probable murders.\n\nSoon, Holmes whistled for a dog-cart and invited me to join him on a journey to The Cedars, the home of a Mr. Neville St. Clair, who had recently vanished. As we rode through dark, empty streets toward the suburbs, Holmes brooded in silence, then praised my ability to keep quiet, noting its value as he grappled with the troubling case. Holmes then outlined the disappearance: Neville St. Clair was a well-off, well-liked family man with no apparent money issues, who went to town on a Monday and was later seen by his wife in distress at the window of the local opium den. She had tried to reach him but was forced away by the den’s proprietor and an assistant. When police searched, they found only a crippled beggar, Hugh Boone, and St. Clair’s clothes (minus his coat). There were blood stains on the window and floor, and the coat was later found in the river, pockets stuffed with coins, but no body.\n\nHolmes described the two main suspects: the Lascar, who claimed ignorance, and Hugh Boone, a well-known, distinctive beggar with a striking appearance. Boone denied seeing St. Clair and said Mrs. St. Clair must have been mistaken, even as blood was found on his sleeve (which he attributed to a minor injury). Boone was arrested but insisted on his innocence, while further police inspection yielded only more mystery. Holmes summarized the challenge: it was a case that seemed straightforward at first but became increasingly perplexing the more he learned."

A stable-boy had run out to the horse’s head, and springing down, I followed Holmes up the small, winding gravel-drive which led to the house. As we approached, the door flew open, and a little blonde woman stood in the opening, clad in some sort of light mousseline de soie, with a touch of fluffy pink chiffon at her neck and wrists. She stood with her figure outlined against the flood of light, one hand upon the door, one half-raised in her eagerness, her body slightly bent, her head and face protruded, with eager eyes and parted lips, a standing question.\n“Well?” she cried, “well?” And then, seeing that there were two of us, she gave a cry of hope which sank into a groan as she saw that my companion shook his head and shrugged his shoulders.\n“No good news?”\n“None.”\n“No bad?”\n“No.”\n“Thank God for that.

If I can be of any assistance, either to you or to my friend here, I shall be indeed happy.”\n“Now, Mr. Sherlock Holmes,” said the lady as we entered a well-lit dining-room, upon the table of which a cold supper had been laid out, “I should very much like to ask you one or two plain questions, to which I beg that you will give a plain answer.”\n“Certainly, madam.”\n“Do not trouble about my feelings. I am not hysterical, nor given to fainting. I simply wish to hear your real, real opinion.”\n“Upon what point?”\n“In your heart of hearts, do you think that Neville is alive?”\nSherlock Holmes seemed to be embarrassed by the question. “Frankly, now!” she repeated, standing upon the rug and looking keenly down at him as he leaned back in a basket-chair.\n“Frankly, then, madam, I do not.”\n“You think that he is dead?”\n“I do.”\n“Murdered?”\n“I don’t say that. Perhaps.”\n“And on what day did he meet his death?”\n“On Monday.”\n“Then perhaps, Mr. Holmes, you will be good enough to explain how it is that I have received a letter from him to-day.”",

I just want your honest opinion.\"\n\n\"About what, specifically?\"\n\n\"Deep down, do you believe Neville is still alive?\"\n\nHolmes appeared uneasy. \"Please be frank!\" she insisted, standing before him as he sat back in a chair.\n\n\"Honestly, madam, I do not.\"\n\n\"So you think he’s dead?\"\n\n\"I do.\"\n\n\"Murdered?\"\n\n\"I can’t say for sure. Possibly.\"\n\n\"And when did he die?\"\n\n\"On Monday.\"\n\n\"Then, Mr. Holmes, perhaps you can explain how I received a letter from him today.\""

          "text_segment": "Sherlock Holmes sprang out of his chair as if he had been galvanised.\n“What!” he roared.\n“Yes, to-day.” She stood smiling, holding up a little slip of paper in the air.\n“May I see it?”\n“Certainly.”\nHe snatched it from her in his eagerness, and smoothing it out upon the table he drew over the lamp and examined it intently. I had left my chair and was gazing at it over his shoulder. The envelope was a very coarse one and was stamped with the Gravesend postmark and with the date of that very day, or rather of the day before, for it was considerably after midnight.\n“Coarse writing,” murmured Holmes. “Surely this is not your husband’s writing, madam.”\n“No, but the enclosure is.”\n“I perceive also that whoever addressed the envelope had to go and inquire as to the address.”\n“How can you tell that?”\n“The name, you see, is in perfectly black ink, which has dried itself. The rest is of the greyish colour, which shows that blotting-paper has been used. If it had been written straight off, and then blotted, none would be of a deep black shade. This man has written the name, and there has then been a pause before he wrote the address, which can only mean that he was not familiar with it. It is, of course, a trifle, but there is nothing so important as trifles. Let us now see the letter. Ha! there has been an enclosure here!”\n“Yes, there was a ring. His signet-ring.”\n“And you are sure that this is your husband’s hand?”\n“One of his hands.”\n“One?”\n“His hand when he wrote hurriedly. It is very unlike his usual writing, and yet I know it well.”\n“‘Dearest do not be frightened. All will come well. There is a huge error which it may take some little time to rectify. Wait in patience.—NEVILLE.’ Written in pencil upon the fly-leaf of a book, octavo size, no water-mark. Hum! Posted to-day in Gravesend by a man with a dirty thumb. Ha! And the flap has been gummed, if I am not very much in error, by a person who had been chewing tobacco. And you have no doubt that it is your husband’s hand, madam?”\n“None. Neville wrote those words.”\n“And they were posted to-day at Gravesend. Well, Mrs. St. Clair, the clouds lighten, though I should not venture to say that the danger is over.”\n“But he must be alive, Mr. Holmes.”\n“Unless this is a clever forgery to put us on the wrong scent. The ring, after all, proves nothing. It may have been taken from him.”\n“No, no; it is, it is his very own writing!”\n“Very well. It may, however, have been written on Monday and only posted to-day.”\n“That is possible.”\n“If so, much may have happened between.”\n“Oh, you must not discourage me, Mr. Holmes. I know that all is well with him. There is so keen a sympathy between us that I should know if evil came upon him. On the very day that I saw him last he cut himself in the bedroom, and yet I in the dining-room rushed upstairs instantly with the utmost certainty that something had happened. Do you think that I would respond to such a trifle and yet be ignorant of his death?”\n“I have seen too much not to know that the impression of a woman may be more valuable than the conclusion of an analytical reasoner. And in this letter you certainly have a very strong piece of evidence to corroborate your view. But if your husband is alive and able to write letters, why should he remain away from you?”\n“I cannot imagine. It is unthinkable.”\n“And on Monday he made no remarks before leaving you?”\n“No.”\n“And you were surprised to see him in Swandam Lane?”\n“Very much so.”\n“Was the window open?”\n“Yes.”\n“Then he might have called to you?”\n“He might.”\n“He only, as I understand, gave an inarticulate cry?”\n“Yes.”\n“A call for help, you thought?”\n“Yes. He waved his hands.”\n“But it might have been a cry of surprise. Astonishment at the unexpected sight of you might cause him to throw up his hands?”\n“It is possible.”\n“And you thought he was pulled back?”\n“He disappeared so suddenly.”\n“He might have leaped back. You did not see anyone else in the room?”\n“No, but this horrible man confessed to having been there, and the Lascar was at the foot of the stairs.”\n“Quite so. Your husband, as far as you could see, had his ordinary clothes on?”\n“But without his collar or tie. I distinctly saw his bare throat.”\n“Had he ever spoken of Swandam Lane?”\n“Never.”\n“Had he ever showed any signs of having taken opium?”\n“Never.”\n“Thank you, Mrs. St. Clair. Those are the principal points about which I wished to be absolutely clear. We shall now have a little supper and then retire, for we may have a very busy day to-morrow.”\nA large and comfortable double-bedded room had been placed at our disposal, and I was quickly between the sheets, for I was weary after my night of adventure. Sherlock Holmes was a man, however, who, when he had an unsolved problem upon his mind, would go for days, and even for a week, without rest, turning it over, rearranging his facts, looking at it from every point of view until he had either fathomed it or convinced himself that his data were insufficient. It was soon evident to me that he was now preparing for an all-night sitting. He took off his coat and waistcoat, put on a large blue dressing-gown, and then wandered about the room collecting pillows from his bed and cushions from the sofa and armchairs. With these he constructed a sort of Eastern divan, upon which he perched himself cross-legged, with an ounce of shag tobacco and a box of matches laid out in front of him. In the dim light of the lamp I saw him sitting there, an old briar pipe between his lips, his eyes fixed vacantly upon the corner of the ceiling, the blue smoke curling up from him, silent, motionless, with the light shining upon his strong-set aquiline features. So he sat as I dropped off to sleep, and so he sat when a sudden ejaculation caused me to wake up, and I found the summer sun shining into the apartment.",
          "paraphrase_gemini-2.5-flash-preview-04-17": "Springing from his chair as if jolted by electricity, Sherlock Holmes roared, \"What!\" \"Yes, today,\" she affirmed, smiling and holding up a small paper slip. \"May I see it?\" he asked. \"Certainly,\" she replied. He snatched it eagerly, smoothed it on the table, drew the lamp closer, and scrutinized it intently. I had left my seat and was looking over his shoulder. The envelope felt quite rough, carried a Gravesend postmark, and was dated that very day, or more accurately, the day before, given it was well past midnight. \"Rough handwriting,\" Holmes mused. \"Surely this is not your husband's script, madam.\" \"No, but the contents are,\" she stated. \"I also observe that whoever addressed the envelope had to stop and verify the address,\" Holmes added. \"How can you tell?\" she asked. \"Look,\" he explained, \"the name is in perfectly black ink that dried without blotting. The rest is greyish, indicating blotting paper was used. If it were written continuously and then blotted, no part would be this deep black. This person wrote the name, then paused before the address, which implies unfamiliarity. It's a minor point, of course, but small details are often the most significant. Let us examine the letter now. Ah, there was an enclosure here!\" \"Yes, a ring. His signet-ring,\" she confirmed. \"And are you positive this is your husband's handwriting?\" \"One of his hands,\" she corrected. \"One?\" \"Yes, his handwriting when he's rushing. It's very unlike his usual style, yet I know it well.\" \"'Dearest do not be frightened. All will come well. There is a huge error which it may take some little time to rectify. Wait in patience.—NEVILLE.' Written in pencil on the fly-leaf of a book, about octavo size, no watermark. Hmm! Mailed today in Gravesend by someone with a dirty thumb. Ha! And the flap was sealed, unless I am mistaken, by a person who had been chewing tobacco. And you have no doubt it's your husband's hand, madam?\" \"None at all. Neville wrote those words.\" \"And they were posted today from Gravesend. Well, Mrs. St. Clair, things look brighter, though I wouldn't say the danger is completely over.\" \"But he must be alive, Mr. Holmes,\" she insisted. \"Unless this is a clever forgery designed to mislead us,\" he cautioned. \"The ring, after all, doesn't prove anything. It might have been taken from him.\" \"No, no; it is, it is his actual writing!\" she protested. \"Very well. However, it might have been written on Monday and only mailed today.\" \"That's possible,\" she conceded. \"If so, a great deal could have happened in between,\" Holmes remarked. \"Oh, you mustn't discourage me, Mr. Holmes. I know he is fine. There is such a strong connection between us that I would sense it if something bad had happened to him. On the very day I last saw him, he cut himself in the bedroom, and although I was in the dining-room, I rushed upstairs instantly, absolutely certain that something had happened. Do you think I would react to such a small thing and yet be unaware of his death?\" \"I have witnessed too much not to know that a woman's feeling can sometimes be more valuable than a logical conclusion,\" Holmes replied. \"And this letter certainly provides strong evidence to support your belief. But if your husband is alive and can write letters, why is he staying away from you?\" \"I cannot imagine. It's incomprehensible.\" \"And on Monday, he said nothing unusual before leaving you?\" \"No.\" \"And you were astonished to see him in Swandam Lane?\" \"Very much so.\" \"Was the window open?\" \"Yes.\" \"Then he could have called to you?\" \"He might have.\" \"As I understand it, he only made an unclear sound?\" \"Yes.\" \"You thought it was a call for help?\" \"Yes. He waved his hands.\" \"But it could have been a cry of surprise,\" Holmes suggested. \"Astonishment at unexpectedly seeing you might have caused him to throw up his hands.\" \"That's possible,\" she admitted. \"And you believed he was pulled back?\" \"He vanished so suddenly.\" \"He might have leaped back. You didn't see anyone else in the room?\" \"No, but this dreadful man confessed to having been present, and the Lascar was at the foot of the stairs.\" \"Quite so,\" Holmes agreed. \"Your husband, from what you could see, was wearing his normal clothes?\" \"Yes, but without his collar or tie. I clearly saw his bare throat.\" \"Had he ever mentioned Swandam Lane?\" \"Never.\" \"Had he ever shown any signs of opium use?\" \"Never.\" \"Thank you, Mrs. St. Clair,\" Holmes concluded. \"Those are the main points I needed to be absolutely clear on. We shall now have some supper and then go to bed, as tomorrow could be a very busy day.\" We were allocated a large and comfortable room with two beds, and I was quickly under the covers, being weary from my adventurous night. Sherlock Holmes, however, was a man who, when preoccupied with an unresolved problem, would often go for days, or even a week, without rest, pondering it, rearranging the facts, and viewing it from every angle until he had either solved it or determined his information was insufficient. It soon became clear to me that he was preparing for an all-night session. He removed his coat and vest, put on a large blue dressing gown, and then moved around the room collecting pillows from his bed and cushions from the sofa and armchairs. With these, he constructed a kind of Eastern lounging area, upon which he perched himself cross-legged, with an ounce of shag tobacco and a box of matches arranged before him. In the dim light of the lamp, I watched him sitting there, an old briar pipe between his lips, his eyes fixed blankly upon the corner of the ceiling, blue smoke curling up from him, silent, motionless, the light illuminating his strong, aquiline features. He remained in that position as I drifted off to sleep, and he was still sitting there when a sudden sharp exclamation woke me, and I saw the summer sun shining into the room.",
          "paraphrase_gpt-4.1-2025-04-14": "Sherlock Holmes jumped from his chair as if he had received a shock. \n\n\"What!\" he shouted. \n\n\"Yes, today.\" The woman smiled and held up a small slip of paper. \n\n\"May I look at it?\" \n\n\"Of course.\" \n\nEagerly, Holmes snatched the paper from her, smoothed it out on the table, pulled the lamp closer, and scrutinized it carefully. I left my seat to peer at it over his shoulder. The envelope was coarse, stamped with a Gravesend postmark and dated that day—or rather, the previous day, since it was well past midnight.\n\n\"Crude handwriting,\" Holmes noted. \"This surely isn’t your husband’s, madam.\"\n\n\"No, but the note inside is.\" \n\n\"I can also see that whoever addressed the envelope had to check for the address.\"\n\n\"How do you know that?\"\n\n\"See, the name is written in deep black ink, dried by itself.

It differs from his usual, but I know it.\"\n\nHolmes read aloud: \"’Dearest, do not be alarmed. Everything will be fine. There’s a huge mistake that may take a while to correct. Wait patiently.—NEVILLE.’ Written in pencil inside a book, octavo sized, no water-mark. Hmmm! Mailed today from Gravesend by a man with a dirty thumb. And judging by the taste, the envelope flap was probably sealed by someone who chews tobacco. And you’re sure your husband wrote this?\"\n\n\"Absolutely.

For example, on the day I last saw him, he cut himself in the bedroom, and even though I was in the dining room, I rushed upstairs, sure something was wrong. If I can sense something so trivial, wouldn’t I know if he had died?\"\n\n\"In my experience, a woman’s intuition can often be more valuable than logical analysis. And this letter is strong evidence for your belief. Still, if your husband is alive and can write, why would he stay away from you?\"\n\n\"I can’t even imagine. It’s inconceivable.\"\n\n\"On Monday, before he left, did he say anything unusual?\"\n\n\"No.\"\n\n\"Were you surprised to see him in Swandam Lane?\"\n\n\"Very much.\"\n\n\"Was the window open?\"\n\n\"Yes.\"\n\n\"So he could have called to you?\"\n\n\"He could have.\"\n\n\"But as I understand, he only made an inarticulate cry?\"\n\n\"Yes.\"\n\n\"Did you think it was a call for help?\"\n\n\"Yes.

Holmes, however, was the type of man who, if faced with an unsolved mystery, could go without sleep for days, even a week, constantly turning over the facts, considering every angle, until he either solved the puzzle or decided he lacked enough information. It was clear he was settling in for an all-night session. He removed his jacket and waistcoat, put on a large blue dressing gown, and collected pillows and cushions from the bed, sofa, and armchairs to build a kind of Eastern divan. He perched cross-legged atop this, with tobacco and matches before him. In the dim lamplight, I saw him sitting there, old briar pipe in mouth, staring thoughtfully at the ceiling corner, blue smoke curling up, completely still, the light on his strong, aquiline features. He was still sitting like that when I drifted to sleep—and still there, unmoving, when I awoke suddenly to find morning sunlight streaming in."

No one is stirring yet, but I know where the stable-boy sleeps, and we shall soon have the trap out.” He chuckled to himself as he spoke, his eyes twinkled, and he seemed a different man to the sombre thinker of the previous night.\nAs I dressed I glanced at my watch. It was no wonder that no one was stirring. It was twenty-five minutes past four. I had hardly finished when Holmes returned with the news that the boy was putting in the horse.\n“I want to test a little theory of mine,” said he, pulling on his boots. “I think, Watson, that you are now standing in the presence of one of the most absolute fools in Europe. I deserve to be kicked from here to Charing Cross. But I think I have the key of the affair now.”\n“And where is it?” I asked, smiling.\n“In the bathroom,” he answered. “Oh, yes, I am not joking,” he continued, seeing my look of incredulity. “I have just been there, and I have taken it out, and I have got it in this Gladstone bag. Come on, my boy, and we shall see whether it will not fit the lock.”\nWe made our way downstairs as quietly as possible, and out into the bright morning sunshine. In the road stood our horse and trap, with the half-clad stable-boy waiting at the head. We both sprang in, and away we dashed down the London Road. A few country carts were stirring, bearing in vegetables to the metropolis, but the lines of villas on either side were as silent and lifeless as some city in a dream.\n“It has been in some points a singular case,” said Holmes, flicking the horse on into a gallop. “I confess that I have been as blind as a mole, but it is better to learn wisdom late than never to learn it at all.”\nIn town the earliest risers were just beginning to look sleepily from their windows as we drove through the streets of the Surrey side. Passing down the Waterloo Bridge Road we crossed over the river, and dashing up Wellington Street wheeled sharply to the right and found ourselves in Bow Street. Sherlock Holmes was well known to the force, and the two constables at the door saluted him. One of them held the horse’s head while the other led us in.\n“Who is on duty?” asked Holmes.\n“Inspector Bradstreet, sir.”\n“Ah, Bradstreet, how are you?” A tall, stout official had come down the stone-flagged passage, in a peaked cap and frogged jacket. “I wish to have a quiet word with you, Bradstreet.”\n“Certainly, Mr. Holmes. Step into my room here.”\nIt was a small, office-like room, with a huge ledger upon the table, and a telephone projecting from the wall. The inspector sat down at his desk.\n“What can I do for you, Mr. Holmes?”\n“I called about that beggarman, Boone—the one who was charged with being concerned in the disappearance of Mr. Neville St. Clair, of Lee.”\n“Yes. He was brought up and remanded for further inquiries.”\n“So I heard. You have him here?”\n“In the cells.”\n“Is he quiet?”\n“Oh, he gives no trouble. But he is a dirty scoundrel.”\n“Dirty?”\n“Yes, it is all we can do to make him wash his hands, and his face is as black as a tinker’s. Well, when once his case has been settled, he will have a regular prison bath; and I think, if you saw him, you would agree with me that he needed it.”\n“I should like to see him very much.”\n“Would you? That is easily done. Come this way. You can leave your bag.”\n“No, I think that I’ll take it.”\n“Very good. Come this way, if you please.” He led us down a passage, opened a barred door, passed down a winding stair, and brought us to a whitewashed corridor with a line of doors on each side.\n“The third on the right is his,” said the inspector. “Here it is!” He quietly shot back a panel in the upper part of the door and glanced through.\n“He is asleep,” said he. “You can see him very well.”\nWe both put our eyes to the grating. The prisoner lay with his face towards us, in a very deep sleep, breathing slowly and heavily. He was a middle-sized man, coarsely clad as became his calling, with a coloured shirt protruding through the rent in his tattered coat. He was, as the inspector had said, extremely dirty, but the grime which covered his face could not conceal its repulsive ugliness. A broad wheal from an old scar ran right across it from eye to chin, and by its contraction had turned up one side of the upper lip, so that three teeth were exposed in a perpetual snarl. A shock of very bright red hair grew low over his eyes and forehead.\n“He’s a beauty, isn’t he?” said the inspector.\n“He certainly needs a wash,” remarked Holmes. “I had an idea that he might, and I took the liberty of bringing the tools with me.” He opened the Gladstone bag as he spoke, and took out, to my astonishment, a very large bath-sponge.\n“He! he! You are a funny one,” chuckled the inspector.\n“Now, if you will have the great goodness to open that door very quietly, we will soon make him cut a much more respectable figure.”\n“Well, I don’t know why not,” said the inspector. “He doesn’t look a credit to the Bow Street cells, does he?” He slipped his key into the lock, and we all very quietly entered the cell. The sleeper half turned, and then settled down once more into a deep slumber. Holmes stooped to the water-jug, moistened his sponge, and then rubbed it twice vigorously across and down the prisoner’s face.\n“Let me introduce you,” he shouted, “to Mr. Neville St. Clair, of Lee, in the county of Kent.”\nNever in my life have I seen such a sight. The man’s face peeled off under the sponge like the bark from a tree. Gone was the coarse brown tint! Gone, too, was the horrid scar which had seamed it across, and the twisted lip which had given the repulsive sneer to the face! A twitch brought away the tangled red hair, and there, sitting up in his bed, was a pale, sad-faced, refined-looking man, black-haired and smooth-skinned, rubbing his eyes and staring about him with sleepy bewilderment. Then suddenly realising the exposure, he broke into a scream and threw himself down with his face to the pillow.\n“Great heavens!” cried the inspector, “it is, indeed, the missing man. I know him from the photograph.”\nThe prisoner turned with the reckless air of a man who abandons himself to his destiny. “Be it so,” said he. “And pray what am I charged with?”\n“With making away with Mr. Neville St.— Oh, come, you can’t be charged with that unless they make a case of attempted suicide of it,” said the inspector with a grin. “Well, I have been twenty-seven years in the force, but this really takes the cake.”\n“If I am Mr. Neville St. Clair, then it is obvious that no crime has been committed, and that, therefore, I am illegally detained.”\n“No crime, but a very great error has been committed,” said Holmes. “You would have done better to have trusted your wife.”\n“It was not the wife; it was the children,” groaned the prisoner. “God help me, I would not have them ashamed of their father. My God! What an exposure! What can I do?”\nSherlock Holmes sat down beside him on the couch and patted him kindly on the shoulder.\n“If you leave it to a court of law to clear the matter up,” said he, “of course you can hardly avoid publicity. On the other hand, if you convince the police authorities that there is no possible case against you, I do not know that there is any reason that the details should find their way into the papers. Inspector Bradstreet would, I am sure, make notes upon anything which you might tell us and submit it to the proper authorities. The case would then never go into court at all.”\n“God bless you!” cried the prisoner passionately. “I would have endured imprisonment, ay, even execution, rather than have left my miserable secret as a family blot to my children.\n“You are the first who have ever heard my story. My father was a schoolmaster in Chesterfield, where I received an excellent education. I travelled in my youth, took to the stage, and finally became a reporter on an evening paper in London. One day my editor wished to have a series of articles upon begging in the metropolis, and I volunteered to supply them. There was the point from which all my adventures started. It was only by trying begging as an amateur that I could get the facts upon which to base my articles. When an actor I had, of course, learned all the secrets of making up, and had been famous in the green-room for my skill. I took advantage now of my attainments. I painted my face, and to make myself as pitiable as possible I made a good scar and fixed one side of my lip in a twist by the aid of a small slip of flesh-coloured plaster. Then with a red head of hair, and an appropriate dress, I took my station in the business part of the city, ostensibly as a match-seller but really as a beggar. For seven hours I plied my trade, and when I returned home in the evening I found to my surprise that I had received no less than 26s. 4d.\n“I wrote my articles and thought little more of the matter until, some time later, I backed a bill for a friend and had a writ served upon me for £ 25. I was at my wit’s end where to get the money, but a sudden idea came to me. I begged a fortnight’s grace from the creditor, asked for a holiday from my employers, and spent the time in begging in the City under my disguise. In ten days I had the money and had paid the debt.\n“Well, you can imagine how hard it was to settle down to arduous work at £ 2 a week when I knew that I could earn as much in a day by smearing my face with a little paint, laying my cap on the ground, and sitting still. It was a long fight between my pride and the money, but the dollars won at last, and I threw up reporting and sat day after day in the corner which I had first chosen, inspiring pity by my ghastly face and filling my pockets with coppers. Only one man knew my secret. He was the keeper of a low den in which I used to lodge in Swandam Lane, where I could every morning emerge as a squalid beggar and in the evenings transform myself into a well-dressed man about town. This fellow, a Lascar, was well paid by me for his rooms, so that I knew that my secret was safe in his possession.\n“Well, very soon I found that I was saving considerable sums of money. I do not mean that any beggar in the streets of London could earn £ 700 a year—which is less than my average takings—but I had exceptional advantages in my power of making up, and also in a facility of repartee, which improved by practice and made me quite a recognised character in the City. All day a stream of pennies, varied by silver, poured in upon me, and it was a very bad day in which I failed to take £ 2.\n“As I grew richer I grew more ambitious, took a house in the country, and eventually married, without anyone having a suspicion as to my real occupation. My dear wife knew that I had business in the City. She little knew what.\n“Last Monday I had finished for the day and was dressing in my room above the opium den when I looked out of my window and saw, to my horror and astonishment, that my wife was standing in the street, with her eyes fixed full upon me. I gave a cry of surprise, threw up my arms to cover my face, and, rushing to my confidant, the Lascar, entreated him to prevent anyone from coming up to me. I heard her voice downstairs, but I knew that she could not ascend. Swiftly I threw off my clothes, pulled on those of a beggar, and put on my pigments and wig. Even a wife’s eyes could not pierce so complete a disguise. But then it occurred to me that there might be a search in the room, and that the clothes might betray me. I threw open the window, reopening by my violence a small cut which I had inflicted upon myself in the bedroom that morning. Then I seized my coat, which was weighted by the coppers which I had just transferred to it from the leather bag in which I carried my takings. I hurled it out of the window, and it disappeared into the Thames. The other clothes would have followed, but at that moment there was a rush of constables up the stair, and a few minutes after I found, rather, I confess, to my relief, that instead of being identified as Mr. Neville St. Clair, I was arrested as his murderer.\n“I do not know that there is anything else for me to explain. I was determined to preserve my disguise as long as possible, and hence my preference for a dirty face. Knowing that my wife would be terribly anxious, I slipped off my ring and confided it to the Lascar at a moment when no constable was watching me, together with a hurried scrawl, telling her that she had no cause to fear.”\n“That note only reached her yesterday,” said Holmes.\n“Good God! What a week she must have spent!”\n“The police have watched this Lascar,” said Inspector Bradstreet, “and I can quite understand that he might find it difficult to post a letter unobserved. Probably he handed it to some sailor customer of his, who forgot all about it for some days.”\n“That was it,” said Holmes, nodding approvingly; “I have no doubt of it. But have you never been prosecuted for begging?”\n“Many times; but what was a fine to me?”\n“It must stop here, however,” said Bradstreet. “If the police are to hush this thing up, there must be no more of Hugh Boone.”\n“I have sworn it by the most solemn oaths which a man can take.”\n“In that case I think that it is probable that no further steps may be taken. But if you are found again, then all must come out. I am sure, Mr. Holmes, that we are very much indebted to you for having cleared the matter up. I wish I knew how you reach your results.”\n“I reached this one,” said my friend, “by sitting upon five pillows and consuming an ounce of shag. I think, Watson, that if we drive to Baker Street we shall just be in time for breakfast.”",
          "paraphrase_gemini-2.5-flash-preview-04-17": "Sherlock Holmes sat with his pipe, smoke curling upwards, and while the room was thick with tobacco haze, the large quantity of shag tobacco I had seen the previous night was gone. \"Awake, Watson?\" he asked. \"Yes.\" \"Ready for an early drive?\" \"Certainly.\" \"Then get dressed. No one else is up yet, but I know where the stable-boy sleeps, and we'll have the carriage out quickly.\" He chuckled as he spoke, his eyes sparkling; he seemed entirely different from the serious thinker of the night before. As I dressed, I checked my watch. It was hardly surprising that no one was stirring; it was twenty-five past four. I had barely finished when Holmes returned, reporting that the boy was harnessing the horse. \"I want to test a small theory,\" he said, pulling on his boots. \"Watson, I believe you are currently in the presence of one of Europe's greatest fools. I deserve to be kicked all the way to Charing Cross. But I think I have the solution to the case now.\" \"And where is it?\" I asked, smiling. \"In the bathroom,\" he replied. \"Oh, yes, I'm not joking,\" he added, seeing my look of disbelief. \"I've just been in there, taken it out, and it's in this Gladstone bag. Come on, my boy, and we'll see if it fits the lock.\" We quietly made our way downstairs and out into the bright morning sunshine. Our horse and trap were waiting in the road, with the stable-boy, still half-dressed, holding the horse's head. We both jumped in, and we dashed off down the London Road. A few market carts were heading into the city with vegetables, but the rows of houses along either side were as silent and lifeless as a dream city. \"This has been a peculiar case in some respects,\" said Holmes, urging the horse into a gallop. \"I admit I've been as blind as a mole, but it's better to gain wisdom late than never.\" In town, the very earliest risers were just sleepily peering from their windows as we drove through the streets on the Surrey side. Going down Waterloo Bridge Road, we crossed the river and wheeled sharply right up Wellington Street, arriving at Bow Street. Sherlock Holmes was well known to the police, and the two constables at the entrance saluted him.

Well, once his case is settled, he'll get a proper prison bath; and I think if you saw him, you'd agree he needs it.\" \"I would very much like to see him.\" \"Would you? That's easily done. Come this way. You can leave your bag.\" \"No, I think I'll take it.\" \"Very good. Come this way, please.\" He led us down a passage, opened a barred door, descended a winding stair, and brought us to a whitewashed corridor with cell doors on each side. \"His is the third on the right,\" said the inspector. \"Here it is!\" He quietly slid back a panel in the top part of the door and looked through. \"He's asleep,\" he said. \"You can see him clearly.\" We both put our eyes to the grating. The prisoner lay facing us, deeply asleep, breathing slowly and heavily. He was a middle-sized man, dressed in rough clothes suitable for his apparent occupation, with a colored shirt showing through a tear in his worn coat. As the inspector noted, he was extremely dirty, but the grime covering his face couldn't hide its unpleasant ugliness. A wide welt from an old scar stretched across it from eye to chin, its tightening pulling up one side of his upper lip, exposing three teeth in what looked like a perpetual sneer. A mass of very bright red hair grew low over his eyes and forehead. \"He's a beauty, isn't he?\" said the inspector. \"He certainly needs a wash,\" Holmes remarked. \"I had a feeling he might, and I took the liberty of bringing the equipment with me.\" He opened the Gladstone bag as he spoke and, to my surprise, took out a very large bath-sponge. \"He! he! You're a funny fellow,\" chuckled the inspector. \"Now, if you would be so kind as to open that door very quietly, we'll soon make him look much more presentable.\" \"Well, I don't see why not,\" said the inspector. \"He doesn't exactly do the Bow Street cells proud, does he?\" He slipped his key into the lock, and we all entered the cell very quietly. The sleeper half turned, then settled back into a deep slumber. Holmes stooped to the water-jug, wet his sponge, and then rubbed it vigorously twice across and down the prisoner's face. \"Let me introduce you,\" he shouted, \"to Mr. Neville St. Clair, of Lee, in the county of Kent.\" Never in my life had I witnessed such a sight. The man's face peeled off under the sponge like bark from a tree. The rough brown color was gone! Gone, too, was the dreadful scar that had marked it, and the twisted lip that had given the face its repulsive sneer! A twitch pulled away the tangled red hair, and there, sitting up in his bed, was a pale, sad-faced, refined-looking man, with black hair and smooth skin, rubbing his eyes and staring about him in sleepy confusion. Then, suddenly realizing he was exposed, he let out a scream and threw himself face down onto the pillow. \"Great heavens!\" cried the inspector, \"it truly is the missing man. I recognize him from the photograph.\" The prisoner turned with the indifferent air of someone who accepts his fate. \"So be it,\" he said. \"And please, what am I charged with?\" \"With making away with Mr. Neville St.— Oh, come, you can't be charged with that unless they make a case of attempted suicide,\" said the inspector with a grin. \"Well, I've been on the force for twenty-seven years, but this really takes the cake.\" \"If I am Mr. Neville St. Clair,\" the prisoner stated, \"then obviously no crime has been committed, and therefore I am being illegally detained.\" \"No crime, but a very significant error has been made,\" said Holmes. \"You should have trusted your wife.\" \"It wasn't for my wife; it was for the children,\" groaned the prisoner. \"God help me, I couldn't bear for them to be ashamed of their father. My God! What an exposure! What am I to do?\" Sherlock Holmes sat down beside him on the cot and gently patted his shoulder. \"If you leave it to a court of law to sort out,\" he said, \"of course, you can hardly avoid publicity. On the other hand, if you convince the police authorities that there is no possible case against you, I don't see any reason why the details should get into the newspapers. Inspector Bradstreet, I'm sure, would take down anything you tell us and submit it to the relevant authorities.

          "paraphrase_gpt-4.1-2025-04-14": "Holmes was sitting as before, smoking his pipe in a room thick with tobacco smoke, but the pile of tobacco I had seen the night before was gone. He asked if I was awake and ready for a drive, to which I agreed. He instructed me to get dressed, saying he knew where the stable-boy was and that we would have the carriage ready soon. Holmes appeared cheerful and energetic, a contrast to his mood from the previous evening. As I dressed, I noticed it was just past 4:25 AM, explaining why everyone else was still asleep. Shortly after I finished getting ready, Holmes returned to inform me the boy was readying the horse. Holmes, while putting on his boots, told me he wanted to test a theory and joked about being foolish for missing something, but believed he had finally figured out the case. I asked where the key to the mystery was, and he replied it was in the bathroom and showed me the evidence in his Gladstone bag, telling me we'd soon see if it fit the lock.\n\nWe quietly went downstairs and outside into the clear morning. Our horse and carriage were waiting, and the stable-boy stood shivering. We got in and drove quickly down the main road to London, passing a few early market carts. The houses lining the road were silent and empty, like a town in a dream. Holmes remarked on the unusual nature of the case, admitting he had been slow to understand, but it was better to realize the truth late than never. As we reached the city, a few people were just beginning their day. We crossed the river to Bow Street, where Holmes was recognized by the police officers on duty, who greeted him and led us inside.\n\nHolmes asked for Inspector Bradstreet, who soon appeared and invited us into his office. Holmes explained he was there regarding Boone, the beggar suspected in the disappearance of Neville St. Clair. Bradstreet confirmed Boone was in custody and was difficult only in his lack of hygiene, noting his face was filthy and his hands rarely washed. Holmes asked to see Boone, and the inspector agreed. Despite Bradstreet suggesting Holmes could leave his bag, Holmes insisted on keeping it. Bradstreet led us through passages and down stairs to the cells, pausing at Boone's door to peer in and see him sleeping.\n\nThrough the peephole, we saw Boone asleep, his face dirty and ugly, with a twisted lip and a scar, and red hair down to his forehead. Bradstreet joked about Boone’s appearance, Holmes replied that he had anticipated this and had brought cleaning supplies, unveiling a bath-sponge from his bag. Bradstreet found this amusing and agreed to unlock the door quietly. We entered, and while Boone slept, Holmes quickly washed his face, revealing underneath not Boone the beggar, but actually Neville St. Clair himself. The transformation was so extraordinary that even Bradstreet was shocked, immediately recognizing the missing man. St. Clair, now exposed, resignedly asked what he was accused of. Bradstreet, realizing the error, noted that St. Clair couldn’t be charged with his own disappearance, and marveled at the situation.\n\nSt. Clair pointed out that since no crime was committed, he shouldn’t have been detained, although Holmes said a great mistake had been made—St. Clair should have confided in his wife. St. Clair explained that he kept his secret not from his wife, but for the sake of his children, to spare their shame. Holmes reassured him that if he explained everything and the police were satisfied, the matter need not become public.\n\nGratefully, St. Clair described his story: His father was a schoolmaster in Chesterfield, and St. Clair himself had an education, worked as an actor, then as a reporter in London. He was once assigned to write about beggars, so he disguised himself as one, using skills from acting to convincingly alter his appearance. He discovered that he could make a substantial sum begging, much more easily than as a reporter, especially as his disguise and mannerisms drew more sympathy and money than most. Eventually, financial difficulties inspired him to beg in disguise to pay debts. The financial rewards quickly outpaced his regular job, so he gave up reporting and regularly worked as a beggar in the city, unknown to his wife, except for a confidant, a Lascar who owned a den where St. Clair could change between his two identities.\n\nSt. Clair prospered as a beggar, even buying a country home and marrying, keeping his double life a secret. One day, he was changing out of his disguise above the opium den when he spotted his wife outside, staring at him. Panicked, he completed his transformation into the beggar, ensured his room had nothing to reveal his identity by throwing his weighted coat out the window, and ended up being arrested as the supposed murderer—himself—by the arriving police. During his detention, he managed to get a message and his ring to his wife through his Lascar confidant, although it took days to reach her.\n\nHolmes and Bradstreet concluded that the letter had been delayed by the Lascar or his intermediaries. When asked if he had been prosecuted for begging before, St. Clair said fines meant nothing to him, but Bradstreet warned the deception had to end or the truth would come out. St. Clair promised to stop, and, with the case closed, Bradstreet thanked Holmes for solving it, while Holmes joked that his method was simply smoking and reflecting. Holmes then suggested to Watson they would just get back to Baker Street in time for breakfast."

          "text_segment": "I had called upon my friend Sherlock Holmes upon the second morning after Christmas, with the intention of wishing him the compliments of the season. He was lounging upon the sofa in a purple dressing-gown, a pipe-rack within his reach upon the right, and a pile of crumpled morning papers, evidently newly studied, near at hand. Beside the couch was a wooden chair, and on the angle of the back hung a very seedy and disreputable hard-felt hat, much the worse for wear, and cracked in several places. A lens and a forceps lying upon the seat of the chair suggested that the hat had been suspended in this manner for the purpose of examination.\n“You are engaged,” said I; “perhaps I interrupt you.”\n“Not at all. I am glad to have a friend with whom I can discuss my results. The matter is a perfectly trivial one”—he jerked his thumb in the direction of the old hat—“but there are points in connection with it which are not entirely devoid of interest and even of instruction.”\nI seated myself in his armchair and warmed my hands before his crackling fire, for a sharp frost had set in, and the windows were thick with the ice crystals. “I suppose,” I remarked, “that, homely as it looks, this thing has some deadly story linked on to it—that it is the clue which will guide you in the solution of some mystery and the punishment of some crime.”\n“No, no. No crime,” said Sherlock Holmes, laughing. “Only one of those whimsical little incidents which will happen when you have four million human beings all jostling each other within the space of a few square miles. Amid the action and reaction of so dense a swarm of humanity, every possible combination of events may be expected to take place, and many a little problem will be presented which may be striking and bizarre without being criminal. We have already had experience of such.”\n“So much so,” I remarked, “that of the last six cases which I have added to my notes, three have been entirely free of any legal crime.”\n“Precisely. You allude to my attempt to recover the Irene Adler papers, to the singular case of Miss Mary Sutherland, and to the adventure of the man with the twisted lip. Well, I have no doubt that this small matter will fall into the same innocent category. You know Peterson, the commissionaire?”\n“Yes.”\n“It is to him that this trophy belongs.”\n“It is his hat.”\n“No, no, he found it. Its owner is unknown. I beg that you will look upon it not as a battered billycock but as an intellectual problem. And, first, as to how it came here. It arrived upon Christmas morning, in company with a good fat goose, which is, I have no doubt, roasting at this moment in front of Peterson’s fire. The facts are these: about four o’clock on Christmas morning, Peterson, who, as you know, is a very honest fellow, was returning from some small jollification and was making his way homeward down Tottenham Court Road. In front of him he saw, in the gaslight, a tallish man, walking with a slight stagger, and carrying a white goose slung over his shoulder. As he reached the corner of Goodge Street, a row broke out between this stranger and a little knot of roughs. One of the latter knocked off the man’s hat, on which he raised his stick to defend himself and, swinging it over his head, smashed the shop window behind him. Peterson had rushed forward to protect the stranger from his assailants; but the man, shocked at having broken the window, and seeing an official-looking person in uniform rushing towards him, dropped his goose, took to his heels, and vanished amid the labyrinth of small streets which lie at the back of Tottenham Court Road. The roughs had also fled at the appearance of Peterson, so that he was left in possession of the field of battle, and also of the spoils of victory in the shape of this battered hat and a most unimpeachable Christmas goose.”\n“Which surely he restored to their owner?”\n“My dear fellow, there lies the problem. It is true that ‘For Mrs. Henry Baker’ was printed upon a small card which was tied to the bird’s left leg, and it is also true that the initials ‘H. B.’ are legible upon the lining of this hat, but as there are some thousands of Bakers, and some hundreds of Henry Bakers in this city of ours, it is not easy to restore lost property to any one of them.”\n“What, then, did Peterson do?”\n“He brought round both hat and goose to me on Christmas morning, knowing that even the smallest problems are of interest to me. The goose we retained until this morning, when there were signs that, in spite of the slight frost, it would be well that it should be eaten without unnecessary delay. Its finder has carried it off, therefore, to fulfil the ultimate destiny of a goose, while I continue to retain the hat of the unknown gentleman who lost his Christmas dinner.”",
          "paraphrase_gemini-2.5-flash-preview-04-17": "A couple of mornings after Christmas, I decided to visit my friend Sherlock Holmes with the intention of conveying my holiday wishes. I found him stretched out on the sofa, dressed in a purple robe, with his pipe-rack conveniently placed to his right and a scattering of crumpled morning newspapers nearby, which he had evidently just finished reading. Next to the couch was a wooden chair, and draped over one corner of its back was a very worn and rather disreputable hard-felt hat, showing significant signs of age and damaged in several spots. The presence of a magnifying glass and forceps on the chair's seat indicated that the hat had been hung there specifically to be examined. Observing this, I remarked, 'You seem occupied; perhaps I'm interrupting.' 'Not in the least,' he replied. 'I'm happy to have a friend with whom I can discuss what I've found. This business is entirely trivial,' he said, gesturing towards the old hat with his thumb, 'but it contains details connected to it that are certainly not without interest, and even offer some insight.' I settled into his armchair and warmed my hands by his lively, crackling fire, as a severe frost had set in, leaving the windows thick with ice patterns. 'I suppose,' I commented, 'that despite its simple appearance, this item is linked to some grave event—that it serves as the critical clue guiding you to solve a mystery and bring a criminal to justice.' Sherlock Holmes chuckled, 'No, no. No crime whatsoever. Just one of those peculiar small incidents that happen when four million people are constantly interacting within a confined urban space. Amidst the hustle and bustle of such a crowded city, every conceivable combination of events can occur, and many minor issues arise which can be striking and odd without involving criminality. We've certainly encountered this before.' 'Indeed,' I agreed, 'so much so that out of the last six cases I've recorded in my notes, three were completely free of any legal crime.' 'Exactly,' he said. 'You're thinking of my attempt to retrieve the Irene Adler documents, the unusual situation of Miss Mary Sutherland, and the case of the man with the twisted lip. Well, I have little doubt that this small matter will fall into the same innocent category. Are you acquainted with Peterson, the doorman?' 'Yes,' I confirmed. 'It is to him that this prize belongs.' 'It's his hat?' I asked. 'No, no, he discovered it. Its owner is unknown. I urge you to view it not just as a battered hat, but as an intellectual puzzle. First, as to how it arrived here. It came on Christmas morning, accompanying a fine, plump goose, which I presume is currently roasting in front of Peterson's fireplace. The facts are as follows: around four o'clock on Christmas morning, Peterson, who, as you know, is a very honest fellow, was heading home down Tottenham Court Road after a minor celebration. Ahead of him, under the gaslight, he spotted a rather tall man, walking with a slight wobble, carrying a white goose slung over his shoulder. As he reached the corner of Goodge Street, a fight broke out between this stranger and a small group of roughs. One of the thugs knocked the man's hat off, prompting him to raise his cane in self-defence. Swinging it above his head, he accidentally smashed the shop window behind him. Peterson rushed forward to protect the stranger from his attackers; but the man, shocked by having broken the window, and seeing an official-looking figure in uniform rushing towards him, dropped his goose, took off running, and disappeared into the complex network of small streets behind Tottenham Court Road. The roughs had also fled upon seeing Peterson arrive, leaving him in command of the scene, and in possession of the spoils of victory in the form of this damaged hat and a perfectly respectable Christmas goose.' 'And surely he returned them to their owner?' I inquired. 'My dear fellow, there lies the problem. It's true that 'For Mrs. Henry Baker' was printed on a small card tied to the bird's left leg, and it's also true that the initials 'H. B.' are visible on the hat's lining. However, given that there are thousands of Bakers, and hundreds of Henry Bakers in this city, it is not easy to return lost property to any single one of them.' 'What did Peterson do then?' I asked. 'He brought both the hat and the goose to me on Christmas morning, knowing that even the smallest problems interest me. We kept the goose until this morning, as it showed signs that, despite the slight frost, it was best to eat it without delay. Its finder has therefore taken it to fulfil its ultimate destiny as a meal, while I continue to hold onto the hat of the unknown gentleman who lost his Christmas dinner.'",
          "paraphrase_gpt-4.1-2025-04-14": "Two days after Christmas, I visited Sherlock Holmes to wish him well for the season. He was relaxing on the sofa in a purple robe, with a rack of pipes beside him and a stack of recently read newspapers nearby. Next to the sofa stood a wooden chair, and hanging from its back was a shabby, worn-out hat with cracks on it. On the seat lay a lens and some forceps, implying the hat was being examined. I commented that I might be interrupting him, to which Holmes replied that he was pleased to have someone to discuss his findings with. He indicated the old hat, stating the matter was unimportant, but had interesting aspects. I warmed myself by the fire, noting the frost outside, and jokingly wondered if the hat was evidence in some dramatic crime. Holmes laughed, explaining that no crime was involved—just one of those odd happenings that occur in a crowded city like London, where countless strange yet non-criminal cases arise. I agreed, mentioning that several recent cases had involved no crime at all, and we recalled examples including the Irene Adler papers and the case of the man with the twisted lip. Holmes believed this case was similarly harmless. He explained the hat belonged to no one he knew: Peterson, the commissionaire, had found it. On Christmas morning, Peterson, returning home after an evening out, saw a tall man staggering down Tottenham Court Road carrying a white goose. At Goodge Street, a group of ruffians accosted the man, one knocked off his hat, and in trying to defend himself, he broke a shop window. Peterson rushed to help; the man, startled by the window breaking and Peterson’s uniform, fled, abandoning the goose and hat. The ruffians likewise scattered, leaving Peterson with the hat and the bird. Identifying the owner was challenging, since the tag on the goose read 'For Mrs. Henry Baker' and the hat was marked 'H. B.', but these names were too common to trace someone easily. Peterson handed both items to Holmes, knowing his interest in such mysteries. They kept the goose until it began to spoil, and so Peterson took it away to cook, while Holmes retained the still-unclaimed hat."

          "text_segment": "“Did he not advertise?”\n“No.”\n“Then, what clue could you have as to his identity?”\n“Only as much as we can deduce.”\n“From his hat?”\n“Precisely.”\n“But you are joking. What can you gather from this old battered felt?”\n“Here is my lens. You know my methods. What can you gather yourself as to the individuality of the man who has worn this article?”\nI took the tattered object in my hands and turned it over rather ruefully. It was a very ordinary black hat of the usual round shape, hard and much the worse for wear. The lining had been of red silk, but was a good deal discoloured. There was no maker’s name; but, as Holmes had remarked, the initials “H. B.” were scrawled upon one side. It was pierced in the brim for a hat-securer, but the elastic was missing. For the rest, it was cracked, exceedingly dusty, and spotted in several places, although there seemed to have been some attempt to hide the discoloured patches by smearing them with ink.\n“I can see nothing,” said I, handing it back to my friend.\n“On the contrary, Watson, you can see everything. You fail, however, to reason from what you see. You are too timid in drawing your inferences.”\n“Then, pray tell me what it is that you can infer from this hat?”\nHe picked it up and gazed at it in the peculiar introspective fashion which was characteristic of him. “It is perhaps less suggestive than it might have been,” he remarked, “and yet there are a few inferences which are very distinct, and a few others which represent at least a strong balance of probability. That the man was highly intellectual is of course obvious upon the face of it, and also that he was fairly well-to-do within the last three years, although he has now fallen upon evil days. He had foresight, but has less now than formerly, pointing to a moral retrogression, which, when taken with the decline of his fortunes, seems to indicate some evil influence, probably drink, at work upon him. This may account also for the obvious fact that his wife has ceased to love him.”\n“My dear Holmes!”\n“He has, however, retained some degree of self-respect,” he continued, disregarding my remonstrance. “He is a man who leads a sedentary life, goes out little, is out of training entirely, is middle-aged, has grizzled hair which he has had cut within the last few days, and which he anoints with lime-cream. These are the more patent facts which are to be deduced from his hat. Also, by the way, that it is extremely improbable that he has gas laid on in his house.”\n“You are certainly joking, Holmes.”\n“Not in the least. Is it possible that even now, when I give you these results, you are unable to see how they are attained?”\n“I have no doubt that I am very stupid, but I must confess that I am unable to follow you. For example, how did you deduce that this man was intellectual?”\nFor answer Holmes clapped the hat upon his head. It came right over the forehead and settled upon the bridge of his nose. “It is a question of cubic capacity,” said he; “a man with so large a brain must have something in it.”\n“The decline of his fortunes, then?”\n“This hat is three years old. These flat brims curled at the edge came in then. It is a hat of the very best quality. Look at the band of ribbed silk and the excellent lining. If this man could afford to buy so expensive a hat three years ago, and has had no hat since, then he has assuredly gone down in the world.”\n“Well, that is clear enough, certainly. But how about the foresight and the moral retrogression?”\nSherlock Holmes laughed. “Here is the foresight,” said he putting his finger upon the little disc and loop of the hat-securer. “They are never sold upon hats. If this man ordered one, it is a sign of a certain amount of foresight, since he went out of his way to take this precaution against the wind. But since we see that he has broken the elastic and has not troubled to replace it, it is obvious that he has less foresight now than formerly, which is a distinct proof of a weakening nature. On the other hand, he has endeavoured to conceal some of these stains upon the felt by daubing them with ink, which is a sign that he has not entirely lost his self-respect.”\n“Your reasoning is certainly plausible.”\n“The further points, that he is middle-aged, that his hair is grizzled, that it has been recently cut, and that he uses lime-cream, are all to be gathered from a close examination of the lower part of the lining. The lens discloses a large number of hair-ends, clean cut by the scissors of the barber. They all appear to be adhesive, and there is a distinct odour of lime-cream. This dust, you will observe, is not the gritty, grey dust of the street but the fluffy brown dust of the house, showing that it has been hung up indoors most of the time, while the marks of moisture upon the inside are proof positive that the wearer perspired very freely, and could therefore, hardly be in the best of training.”\n“But his wife—you said that she had ceased to love him.”\n“This hat has not been brushed for weeks. When I see you, my dear Watson, with a week’s accumulation of dust upon your hat, and when your wife allows you to go out in such a state, I shall fear that you also have been unfortunate enough to lose your wife’s affection.”\n“But he might be a bachelor.”\n“Nay, he was bringing home the goose as a peace-offering to his wife. Remember the card upon the bird’s leg.”\n“You have an answer to everything. But how on earth do you deduce that the gas is not laid on in his house?”\n“One tallow stain, or even two, might come by chance; but when I see no less than five, I think that there can be little doubt that the individual must be brought into frequent contact with burning tallow—walks upstairs at night probably with his hat in one hand and a guttering candle in the other. Anyhow, he never got tallow-stains from a gas-jet. Are you satisfied?”\n“Well, it is very ingenious,” said I, laughing; “but since, as you said just now, there has been no crime committed, and no harm done save the loss of a goose, all this seems to be rather a waste of energy.”\nSherlock Holmes had opened his mouth to reply, when the door flew open, and Peterson, the commissionaire, rushed into the apartment with flushed cheeks and the face of a man who is dazed with astonishment.",
          "paraphrase_gemini-2.5-flash-preview-04-17": "“Did he put out an advertisement?”\n“No.”\n“In that case, what sort of clue could you have regarding his identity?”\n“Only what can be inferred.”\n“From his hat?”\n“Exactly.”\n“You must be kidding. What information can you possibly get from this old, misshapen felt hat?”\n“Take my magnifying glass. You're familiar with my methods. What conclusions can you draw yourself about the character of the person who wore this item?”\nI took the worn hat in my hands, examining it with some regret. It was a very standard black hat, rounded in shape, stiff, and clearly showing signs of heavy use. The lining, originally red silk, was significantly faded. There was no manufacturer's name inside, but as Holmes pointed out, the initials “H. B.” were hastily marked on one side. A hole was punched in the brim for a hat-string, but the elastic cord was gone. Otherwise, it was cracked, covered in dust, and stained in several spots, though someone seemed to have tried to conceal the discolored areas by smearing them with ink.\n“I can discern nothing,” I said, giving it back to my friend.\n“On the contrary, Watson, you can see everything. However, you fail to reason based on what you observe. You are too hesitant in forming your conclusions.”\n“Well then, please tell me what you can deduce from this hat?”\nHe picked it up, studying it with his unique, contemplative focus. “It offers fewer hints than it might have,” he observed, “but there are still a few inferences that are quite clear, and others that are at least highly probable. That the man is highly intelligent is immediately obvious, as is the fact that he was reasonably prosperous within the last three years, although he has now fallen on hard times. He once possessed foresight, but less so now, suggesting a decline in his character, which, combined with his financial troubles, seems to point to some negative influence affecting him, likely alcohol. This might also explain the clear fact that his wife no longer loves him.”\n“Good heavens, Holmes!”\n“He has, however, maintained some measure of self-respect,” he continued, ignoring my exclamation. “He is a person who leads a sedentary life, rarely goes out, is completely out of shape, is middle-aged, has greying hair that was cut very recently, and uses lime-cream on it. These are the more evident facts that can be inferred from his hat. Also, incidentally, it is highly unlikely that his house is equipped with gas lighting.”\n“Surely you're joking, Holmes.”\n“Not at all. Is it possible that even now, after I provide you with these findings, you cannot grasp how I arrived at them?”\n“I admit I must be quite dense, but I confess I cannot follow your reasoning. For instance, how did you conclude that this man was intellectual?”\nIn response, Holmes placed the hat on his own head. It came down low over his forehead and rested on the bridge of his nose. “It's a matter of internal volume,” he explained; “a man with such a large head must have a significant brain inside.”\n“And his financial decline, then?”\n“This hat is three years old. These flat brims with curled edges became fashionable around then. It is a hat of the finest quality. Look at the ribbed silk band and the excellent lining. If this man could afford such an expensive hat three years ago, and hasn't bought another since, then he has undoubtedly seen his fortunes diminish.”\n“Yes, that much is certainly clear. But what about the foresight and the moral decline?”\nSherlock Holmes chuckled. “Here is the foresight,” he said, pointing to the small disc and loop for the hat-securer. “They are never sold already attached to hats. If this man ordered one, it indicates a degree of prudence, as he took the extra step to secure his hat against the wind. But since we see the elastic is broken and he hasn't bothered to replace it, it's clear he has less foresight now than before, which is a definite sign of a weakening resolve. On the other hand, he has tried to hide some of the stains on the felt by applying ink, which suggests he hasn't entirely lost his self-respect.”\n“Your arguments are certainly plausible.”\n“The additional points—that he is middle-aged, that his hair is grizzled, that it has been recently cut, and that he uses lime-cream—are all evident from a close examination of the lower part of the lining. The lens reveals numerous hair clippings, cleanly cut by a barber's scissors. They all seem sticky, and there is a distinct smell of lime-cream. This dust, you will notice, isn't the gritty, grey dust from the street but the light, brown dust of a house, showing it has spent most of its time hanging indoors. The moisture marks on the inside are positive proof that the wearer sweated profusely, and therefore, could hardly be in good physical condition.”\n“But his wife—you said she had stopped loving him.”\n“This hat hasn't been brushed for weeks. My dear Watson, when I see your hat covered in a week's worth of dust, and your wife permits you to leave the house in that condition, I shall worry that you too have had the misfortune of losing your wife's affection.”\n“But he could be a bachelor.”\n“No, he was bringing home the goose as a peace offering to his wife. Recall the tag attached to the bird's leg.”\n“You have an explanation for everything. But how on earth do you deduce that he doesn't have gas lighting in his house?”\n“One tallow stain, or even two, could be accidental; but when I observe no fewer than five, I believe there can be little doubt that the person must frequently encounter burning tallow—likely walks upstairs at night carrying his hat in one hand and a dripping candle in the other. In any case, he certainly didn't get tallow stains from a gas jet. Are you convinced?”\n“Well, it's remarkably clever,” I said, chuckling; “but since, as you just mentioned, no crime has been committed, and no harm done apart from the loss of a goose, all this seems rather pointless.”\nSherlock Holmes was about to reply when the door burst open, and Peterson, the messenger, rushed into the room, his face flushed and wearing an expression of utter astonishment.",
          "paraphrase_gpt-4.1-2025-04-14": "\"Did the man advertise?\" Holmes inquired.\n\"He did not.\"\n\"In that case, how can we determine his identity?\"\n\"All we can do is deduce it.\"\n\"From analyzing his hat?\"\n\"Exactly.\"\n\"You must be joking. What could such a worn felt hat possibly reveal?\"\n\"Take my lens. You’re familiar with my approach. Try to see what you can infer about the person who wore this hat.\"\nI picked up the battered hat somewhat reluctantly. It was a plain black, round hat—hard, and quite shabby. The lining, once red silk, was now badly discolored. There was no manufacturer’s label, though the initials “H. B.” were scrawled inside, as Holmes noted. The brim had a hole for a hat-securer, but the elastic was missing. Otherwise, it was cracked, very dusty, and stained in several places, though someone had tried to hide the discoloration by smearing on ink.\n\n\"I can’t make anything of it,\" I admitted, handing the hat to Holmes.\n\n\"Actually, Watson, you can observe everything. What you lack is reasoning from your observations. You hesitate to draw conclusions.\"\n\"Then tell me—what conclusions do you draw from this hat?\"\n\nHolmes picked it up and studied it in his characteristically thorough way. \"The hat isn’t as suggestive as it could be,\" he said, \"but there are still some definite inferences, and others that are fairly probable. From it, we can see the man is highly intellectual, that he was fairly prosperous three years ago though he’s fallen on hard times since, and once showed foresight but has since declined morally—which likely means some vice, probably drinking, has affected him. This would also explain another fact—that his wife no longer loves him.\"\n\n\"Holmes!\"\n\n\"Still, he has some self-respect left,\" Holmes continued, ignoring my protest. \"He leads a sedentary life, rarely goes out, is entirely out of shape, and is middle-aged with graying hair recently trimmed and styled with lime-cream. You can deduce all of this from his hat. Also, it’s highly unlikely he has gas lighting at home.\"\n\n\"You must be joking.\"\n\n\"Not at all. Isn’t it clear how these observations are made?\"\n\n\"I admit I’m clueless. For instance, how did you deduce his intellect?\"\n\nHolmes put the hat on his own head. It dropped down over his forehead, resting on the bridge of his nose. \"Look at the size—it’s purely a matter of cranial capacity. A head that big must house a substantial brain.\"\n\n\"But the decline in fortune?\"\n\n\"The hat style is three years old—these flat-brimmed, curled-edge hats appeared then. It’s also a high-quality hat, with a good band and fine lining. If he bought such an expensive hat three years ago and hasn’t replaced it, he must have fallen on hard times.\"\n\n\"That makes sense. What about his foresight and moral decline?\"\n\nHolmes smiled, placing his finger on the hat’s small loop for a hat-securer. \"Those aren’t sold with hats. Ordering one shows foresight—he took extra care to prevent losing his hat to the wind. But since the elastic broke and he didn’t replace it, he’s lost some of that foresight, showing a lessening resolve. On the other hand, his efforts to hide stains by smearing ink show he hasn’t fully let go of his self-respect.\"\n\n\"Your logic is quite plausible.\"\n\n\"Other details—his middle age, gray hair, recent haircut, and use of lime-cream—are evident from close examination of the inner lining. The lens shows many ends of hair, freshly snipped by a barber. They’re sticky, and there’s a clear lime-cream scent. The dust is the light brown of a household, not the gritty grey of city streets, indicating the hat was mostly kept indoors. The sweat marks indicate he perspires heavily and thus isn’t physically fit.\"\n\n\"But what about his wife?\"\n\n\"The hat hasn’t been brushed for weeks. If, Watson, you wore such a dusty hat and your wife let you go out that way, I’d worry you’d lost her affection.\"\n\n\"Or he could be a bachelor.\"\n\n\"No, he was taking home the goose as a peace-offering for his wife. Remember the note on the bird’s leg.\"\n\n\"You always have an answer. How did you deduce there’s no gas lighting in his house?\"\n\n\"One or two tallow stains may be coincidence, but not five. The man must often handle burning tallow, likely walking upstairs at night with a candle and his hat. He couldn’t get those stains from gas lighting. Satisfied?\"\n\n\"Very inventive,\" I laughed. \"But since no crime has been committed and aside from the loss of a goose, there’s no harm done, all your deductions seem a bit unnecessary.\"\n\nHolmes was about to answer when Peterson, the commissionaire, burst into the room clearly astonished and flushed."

See what my wife found in its crop!” He held out his hand and displayed upon the centre of the palm a brilliantly scintillating blue stone, rather smaller than a bean in size, but of such purity and radiance that it twinkled like an electric point in the dark hollow of his hand.\nSherlock Holmes sat up with a whistle. “By Jove, Peterson!” said he, “this is treasure trove indeed. I suppose you know what you have got?”\n“A diamond, sir? A precious stone. It cuts into glass as though it were putty.”\n“It’s more than a precious stone.

John Horner, a plumber, was accused of having abstracted it from the lady’s jewel-case. The evidence against him was so strong that the case has been referred to the Assizes. I have some account of the matter here, I believe.” He rummaged amid his newspapers, glancing over the dates, until at last he smoothed one out, doubled it over, and read the following paragraph:\n“Hotel Cosmopolitan Jewel Robbery. John Horner, 26, plumber, was brought up upon the charge of having upon the 22nd inst., abstracted from the jewel-case of the Countess of Morcar the valuable gem known as the blue carbuncle. James Ryder, upper-attendant at the hotel, gave his evidence to the effect that he had shown Horner up to the dressing-room of the Countess of Morcar upon the day of the robbery in order that he might solder the second bar of the grate, which was loose. He had remained with Horner some little time, but had finally been called away. On returning, he found that Horner had disappeared, that the bureau had been forced open, and that the small morocco casket in which, as it afterwards transpired, the Countess was accustomed to keep her jewel, was lying empty upon the dressing-table. Ryder instantly gave the alarm, and Horner was arrested the same evening; but the stone could not be found either upon his person or in his rooms. Catherine Cusack, maid to the Countess, deposed to having heard Ryder’s cry of dismay on discovering the robbery, and to having rushed into the room, where she found matters as described by the last witness. Inspector Bradstreet, B division, gave evidence as to the arrest of Horner, who struggled frantically, and protested his innocence in the strongest terms. Evidence of a previous conviction for robbery having been given against the prisoner, the magistrate refused to deal summarily with the offence, but referred it to the Assizes. Horner, who had shown signs of intense emotion during the proceedings, fainted away at the conclusion and was carried out of court.”",

The goose!\" Holmes, who was lounging on the sofa, turned to face the excited man more clearly and replied, \"Oh? What's happened with it? Did it come back to life and fly out the kitchen window?\" Peterson held out his hand, showing what his wife had discovered inside the bird. In his palm lay a brilliantly shining blue stone, smaller than a bean, but so pure and radiant it glittered like a bright light within the dark cup of his hand. Sherlock Holmes sat up with a sharp intake of breath. \"By Jove, Peterson!\" he said, \"This is quite a find. Do you have any idea what this is?\" \"A diamond, sir? A precious stone. It cuts glass like butter,\" Peterson replied. \"It's more than just a precious stone,\" Holmes corrected. \"It is *the* precious stone.\" \"Surely not the Countess of Morcar's blue carbuncle!\" I burst out. \"Exactly,\" Holmes confirmed. \"I should recognize its size and shape from seeing the advertisement for it in The Times daily. It is unique, and its value can only be guessed, but the £1000 reward offered is certainly less than a twentieth of its true market value.\" \"A thousand pounds! Good heavens!\" The commissionaire dropped into a chair, staring in disbelief at both of us. \"That's the reward,\" Holmes explained, \"and I understand there are significant personal reasons that would lead the Countess to spend half her fortune just to recover the gem.\" \"As I recall correctly,\" I mentioned, \"it went missing at the Hotel Cosmopolitan.\" \"Precisely, on December 22nd, only five days ago. A plumber named John Horner was accused of taking it from the lady's jewel case. The evidence against him was considered so compelling that his case has been sent for trial at a higher court.

John Horner, a 26-year-old plumber, was charged with having, on the 22nd of this month, stolen the valuable blue carbuncle from the jewel case of the Countess of Morcar. James Ryder, a senior hotel employee, testified that he had taken Horner to the Countess of Morcar's dressing room on the day of the theft to repair a loose bar on the fireplace grate. He remained with Horner for a short time but was eventually called away. Upon his return, he discovered Horner was gone, the chest of drawers had been broken open, and the small leather box where, it later emerged, the Countess usually kept her jewel, was found empty on the dressing table. Ryder immediately raised the alarm, and Horner was apprehended that same evening; however, the stone was not found either on his person or in his lodgings. Catherine Cusack, the Countess's maid, stated that she heard Ryder's cry of distress upon finding the theft and rushed into the room, confirming the scene as described by Ryder. Inspector Bradstreet from B division, gave evidence regarding Horner's arrest, noting that he struggled violently and vehemently insisted he was innocent. As evidence of a prior robbery conviction was presented against the defendant, the magistrate declined to handle the case immediately but sent it to the higher court.

So much for the police-court,” said Holmes thoughtfully, tossing aside the paper. “The question for us now to solve is the sequence of events leading from a rifled jewel-case at one end to the crop of a goose in Tottenham Court Road at the other. You see, Watson, our little deductions have suddenly assumed a much more important and less innocent aspect. Here is the stone; the stone came from the goose, and the goose came from Mr. Henry Baker, the gentleman with the bad hat and all the other characteristics with which I have bored you. So now we must set ourselves very seriously to finding this gentleman and ascertaining what part he has played in this little mystery. To do this, we must try the simplest means first, and these lie undoubtedly in an advertisement in all the evening papers. If this fail, I shall have recourse to other methods.”\n“What will you say?”\n“Give me a pencil and that slip of paper. Now, then: ‘Found at the corner of Goodge Street, a goose and a black felt hat. Mr. Henry Baker can have the same by applying at 6:30 this evening at 221B, Baker Street.’ That is clear and concise.”\n“Very. But will he see it?”\n“Well, he is sure to keep an eye on the papers, since, to a poor man, the loss was a heavy one. He was clearly so scared by his mischance in breaking the window and by the approach of Peterson that he thought of nothing but flight, but since then he must have bitterly regretted the impulse which caused him to drop his bird. Then, again, the introduction of his name will cause him to see it, for everyone who knows him will direct his attention to it. Here you are, Peterson, run down to the advertising agency and have this put in the evening papers.”\n“In which, sir?”\n“Oh, in the Globe, Star, Pall Mall, St. James’s Gazette, Evening News, Standard, Echo, and any others that occur to you.”\n“Very well, sir. And this stone?”\n“Ah, yes, I shall keep the stone. Thank you. And, I say, Peterson, just buy a goose on your way back and leave it here with me, for we must have one to give to this gentleman in place of the one which your family is now devouring.”\nWhen the commissionaire had gone, Holmes took up the stone and held it against the light. “It’s a bonny thing,” said he. “Just see how it glints and sparkles. Of course it is a nucleus and focus of crime. Every good stone is. They are the devil’s pet baits. In the larger and older jewels every facet may stand for a bloody deed. This stone is not yet twenty years old. It was found in the banks of the Amoy River in southern China and is remarkable in having every characteristic of the carbuncle, save that it is blue in shade instead of ruby red. In spite of its youth, it has already a sinister history. There have been two murders, a vitriol-throwing, a suicide, and several robberies brought about for the sake of this forty-grain weight of crystallised charcoal. Who would think that so pretty a toy would be a purveyor to the gallows and the prison? I’ll lock it up in my strong box now and drop a line to the Countess to say that we have it.”\n“Do you think that this man Horner is innocent?”\n“I cannot tell.”\n“Well, then, do you imagine that this other one, Henry Baker, had anything to do with the matter?”\n“It is, I think, much more likely that Henry Baker is an absolutely innocent man, who had no idea that the bird which he was carrying was of considerably more value than if it were made of solid gold. That, however, I shall determine by a very simple test if we have an answer to our advertisement.”\n“And you can do nothing until then?”\n“Nothing.”\n“In that case I shall continue my professional round. But I shall come back in the evening at the hour you have mentioned, for I should like to see the solution of so tangled a business.”\n“Very glad to see you. I dine at seven. There is a woodcock, I believe. By the way, in view of recent occurrences, perhaps I ought to ask Mrs. Hudson to examine its crop.”",
          "paraphrase_gemini-2.5-flash-preview-04-17": "Holmes commented thoughtfully on the police-court report after setting the paper aside. He explained that their current task was to trace the chain of events from a broken-into jewel case to the inside of a goose found in Tottenham Court Road. He noted to Watson that their findings had suddenly taken on a much more significant and potentially less innocent dimension. He reiterated that the stone came from the goose, which belonged to Mr. Henry Baker, the man with the distinctive hat and other traits he had previously described. Their immediate goal, he stated, was to locate Mr. Baker and figure out his role in this mystery. He proposed the simplest initial step: placing an advertisement in all the evening newspapers, reserving other methods if this failed. Watson asked what the advertisement would say. Holmes took a pencil and paper, writing, “Found at the corner of Goodge Street, a goose and a black felt hat. Mr. Henry Baker can claim them by calling at 221B, Baker Street this evening at 6:30.” He found the wording clear and to the point. Watson agreed but wondered if the man would see it. Holmes was confident he would be checking the papers, as the loss was considerable for someone of limited means. He felt Baker was likely so frightened by breaking the window and Peterson's approach that he fled without thinking, but had surely regretted dropping the bird since. Moreover, Holmes added, mentioning his name would guarantee recognition, as friends would alert him. He handed the notice to Peterson, telling him to take it to the advertising agency for the evening papers. Peterson inquired which ones. Holmes rattled off several names including the Globe, Star, Pall Mall, St. James’s Gazette, Evening News, Standard, and Echo, adding any others that came to mind. Peterson acknowledged the instruction and asked about the stone. Holmes confirmed he would keep it, thanking him. He also asked Peterson to purchase a goose on his way back and leave it at the flat, so they would have a replacement for Mr. Baker, given that Peterson's family was currently eating the original. Once the commissionaire departed, Holmes picked up the stone, examining it against the light. He called it a lovely thing, admiring its sparkle. He remarked that such valuable stones inevitably become centres of crime, likening them to 'the devil’s pet baits.' He suggested that older, larger jewels often had a history marked by violence. This stone, less than twenty years old and found near the Amoy River in southern China, was unusual for being a blue carbuncle instead of red. Despite its youth, it already had a dark history, having been linked to two murders, an acid attack, a suicide, and multiple robberies, all for its weight of forty grains of crystallised carbon. He mused on the paradox of such a beautiful object being associated with gallows and prison. He decided to secure it in his strong box and write to the Countess to inform her of its recovery. Watson asked if he believed the accused man, Horner, was innocent. Holmes replied that he could not say. Watson then inquired if he suspected the other man, Henry Baker, of involvement. Holmes stated it was far more likely that Henry Baker was entirely innocent, having no idea the goose was worth far more than if it were solid gold. However, he explained, he would confirm this easily based on the response to their advertisement. Watson asked if they could do anything else until then, to which Holmes replied, 'Nothing.' Watson decided he would continue his professional rounds but would return that evening at the appointed time, keen to see the outcome of such a complex case. Holmes welcomed him, mentioning he would be dining at seven and expected woodcock. He added humorously that, in light of recent events, he might need to ask Mrs. Hudson to check the bird's crop.",
          "paraphrase_gpt-4.1-2025-04-14": "\"Hmm, so much for the police report,\" Holmes said pensively as he put aside the newspaper. \"What we need to figure out now is the sequence of events that connects a stolen jewelry box to a goose found in Tottenham Court Road. Watson, our investigation has just turned more serious—this is no longer a harmless puzzle. Here is the gemstone, which was inside the goose, and the goose itself was owned by Mr. Henry Baker, the man I described to you earlier. We now need to track down Mr. Baker and discover what role he has played in this mystery. The simplest way to start is to place an advertisement in all the evening papers; if that doesn't work, I'll try something else.\"\n\n\"What will you say?\" Watson asked.\n\n\"Hand me a pencil and some paper. I'll write: 'Found at the corner of Goodge Street, a goose and a black felt hat. Mr. Henry Baker can claim them by coming to 221B, Baker Street, at 6:30 this evening.' That should be straightforward.\"\n\n\"It is,\" Watson agreed, \"but do you think he'll see the ad?\"\n\n\"He'll be watching the papers, since losing the goose was a major loss for him. He panicked and fled when Peterson showed up after the window was broken, but he likely regrets abandoning his goose now. Plus, using his name in the ad will attract anyone who knows him. Peterson, take this to the advertising agency and arrange for it to be placed in the Globe, Star, Pall Mall, St. James's Gazette, Evening News, Standard, Echo, and any other prominent evening papers you can think of.\"\n\n\"Yes, sir. And what about the gemstone?\"\n\n\"I'll keep hold of that for now, thank you. Also, Peterson, please buy another goose on your way back, so we can give Mr. Baker one to replace the one your family is eating.\"\n\nAfter Peterson left, Holmes examined the gemstone in the light. \"It's a beautiful thing,\" he said. \"Look how it sparkles. Of course, jewels like this are always magnets for crime. In many older gems, each facet symbolizes a bloody deed. This one is less than twenty years old—it was discovered in the banks of the Amoy River in southern China, and although it looks like a carbuncle, it's blue instead of red. Despite its youth, it's already linked to a grim history: two murders, an acid attack, a suicide, and several thefts have happened over this forty-grain crystal. Who would guess that something so pretty could cause so much misery? I'll lock it away and write to the Countess to let her know we have it.\"\n\n\"Do you think Horner is innocent?\" Watson inquired.\n\n\"I can't say for sure.\"\n\n\"What about Henry Baker—could he be involved?\"\n\n\"It's much more likely Baker is entirely innocent, not realizing the goose he carried was more valuable than gold. I'll know for certain if he responds to our ad.\"\n\n\"So there's nothing more to be done for now?\"\n\n\"No, nothing until then.\"\n\n\"Alright. I'll see my patients, but I'll return this evening to see how this turns out.\"\n\n\"I'd be glad to have you. I'm having dinner at seven—woodcock, I think. Given recent events, maybe I should ask Mrs. Hudson to check the bird's crop.\""

          "text_segment": "I had been delayed at a case, and it was a little after half-past six when I found myself in Baker Street once more. As I approached the house I saw a tall man in a Scotch bonnet with a coat which was buttoned up to his chin waiting outside in the bright semicircle which was thrown from the fanlight. Just as I arrived the door was opened, and we were shown up together to Holmes’ room.\n“Mr. Henry Baker, I believe,” said he, rising from his armchair and greeting his visitor with the easy air of geniality which he could so readily assume. “Pray take this chair by the fire, Mr. Baker. It is a cold night, and I observe that your circulation is more adapted for summer than for winter. Ah, Watson, you have just come at the right time. Is that your hat, Mr. Baker?”\n“Yes, sir, that is undoubtedly my hat.”\nHe was a large man with rounded shoulders, a massive head, and a broad, intelligent face, sloping down to a pointed beard of grizzled brown. A touch of red in nose and cheeks, with a slight tremor of his extended hand, recalled Holmes’ surmise as to his habits. His rusty black frock-coat was buttoned right up in front, with the collar turned up, and his lank wrists protruded from his sleeves without a sign of cuff or shirt. He spoke in a slow staccato fashion, choosing his words with care, and gave the impression generally of a man of learning and letters who had had ill-usage at the hands of fortune.\n“We have retained these things for some days,” said Holmes, “because we expected to see an advertisement from you giving your address. I am at a loss to know now why you did not advertise.”\nOur visitor gave a rather shamefaced laugh. “Shillings have not been so plentiful with me as they once were,” he remarked. “I had no doubt that the gang of roughs who assaulted me had carried off both my hat and the bird. I did not care to spend more money in a hopeless attempt at recovering them.”\n“Very naturally. By the way, about the bird, we were compelled to eat it.”\n“To eat it!” Our visitor half rose from his chair in his excitement.\n“Yes, it would have been of no use to anyone had we not done so. But I presume that this other goose upon the sideboard, which is about the same weight and perfectly fresh, will answer your purpose equally well?”\n“Oh, certainly, certainly,” answered Mr. Baker with a sigh of relief.\n“Of course, we still have the feathers, legs, crop, and so on of your own bird, so if you wish—”\nThe man burst into a hearty laugh. “They might be useful to me as relics of my adventure,” said he, “but beyond that I can hardly see what use the disjecta membra of my late acquaintance are going to be to me. No, sir, I think that, with your permission, I will confine my attentions to the excellent bird which I perceive upon the sideboard.”\nSherlock Holmes glanced sharply across at me with a slight shrug of his shoulders.\n“There is your hat, then, and there your bird,” said he. “By the way, would it bore you to tell me where you got the other one from? I am somewhat of a fowl fancier, and I have seldom seen a better grown goose.”\n“Certainly, sir,” said Baker, who had risen and tucked his newly gained property under his arm. “There are a few of us who frequent the Alpha Inn, near the Museum—we are to be found in the Museum itself during the day, you understand. This year our good host, Windigate by name, instituted a goose club, by which, on consideration of some few pence every week, we were each to receive a bird at Christmas. My pence were duly paid, and the rest is familiar to you. I am much indebted to you, sir, for a Scotch bonnet is fitted neither to my years nor my gravity.” With a comical pomposity of manner he bowed solemnly to both of us and strode off upon his way.\n“So much for Mr. Henry Baker,” said Holmes when he had closed the door behind him. “It is quite certain that he knows nothing whatever about the matter. Are you hungry, Watson?”",
          "paraphrase_gemini-2.5-flash-preview-04-17": "Having been held up by a case, I arrived back on Baker Street a little after 6:30 PM. As I neared the house, I noticed a tall man wearing a Scotch bonnet and a coat buttoned up to his chin, waiting by the brightly lit fanlight above the door. Just as I reached the entrance, the door opened, and the man and I were shown upstairs to Holmes's room. \"Mr. Henry Baker, I presume,\" Holmes said, getting up from his chair and greeting his visitor with the warm, friendly manner he could easily adopt. \"Please take this seat by the fire, Mr. Baker. It's a chilly evening, and I see your body is better suited to warm weather than cold. Ah, Watson, perfect timing. Is that your hat, Mr. Baker?\" \"Yes, sir, that is indeed my hat.\" He was a large man with sloped shoulders, a substantial head, and a wide, intelligent face that tapered to a pointed beard of mixed grey and brown. A reddish tint in his nose and cheeks, along with a slight shake in his extended hand, confirmed Holmes's earlier guess about his habits. His well-worn black frock-coat was buttoned completely up the front, with the collar turned up, and his thin wrists stuck out from his sleeves without cuffs or a shirt visible. He spoke slowly, in short bursts, choosing his words carefully, and generally gave the impression of a well-educated man who had faced hardship. \"We kept these items for several days,\" Holmes explained, \"because we expected you to place an advertisement with your address. I'm curious why you didn't advertise.\" Our visitor let out a slightly embarrassed laugh. \"Money hasn't been as plentiful as it once was,\" he replied. \"I was sure the group of ruffians who attacked me had taken both my hat and the bird. I didn't want to waste more money on a futile attempt to get them back.\" \"Very understandable. Speaking of the bird, we had to eat it.\" \"Eat it!\" Our visitor started to rise from his chair in surprise. \"Yes, it would have been useless to anyone if we hadn't. But I assume this other goose on the sideboard, which is about the same weight and perfectly fresh, will serve your needs just as well?\" \"Oh, certainly, certainly,\" Mr. Baker responded with a relieved sigh. \"Of course, we still have the feathers, legs, internal organs, and so forth from your original bird, so if you'd like—\" The man burst into hearty laughter. \"They might be useful as souvenirs of my adventure,\" he said, \"but beyond that, I can hardly imagine what use the scattered remains of my recent companion would be to me. No, sir, I think, with your permission, I will focus on the excellent bird I see on the sideboard.\" Sherlock Holmes shot me a quick look with a slight shrug of his shoulders. \"There is your hat, then, and there is your bird,\" he said. \"By the way, would you mind telling me where you obtained the other one? I'm something of a poultry enthusiast, and I've rarely seen a better-grown goose.\" \"Certainly, sir,\" said Baker, who had stood up and tucked his newly acquired items under his arm. \"A few of us who frequent the Alpha Inn, near the Museum—we spend our days inside the Museum itself, you see—formed a goose club this year, organized by our kind host, Mr. Windigate. For a few pennies each week, we were each to receive a bird at Christmas. My contributions were paid on time, and you know the rest. I am very grateful to you, sir, as a Scotch bonnet suits neither my age nor my dignity.\" With a comically self-important air, he bowed formally to both of us and left. \"So that's Mr. Henry Baker,\" Holmes commented after he had closed the door behind him. \"It's quite clear that he knows absolutely nothing about the matter. Are you hungry, Watson?\"",
          "paraphrase_gpt-4.1-2025-04-14": "I was running late due to a case and didn't return to Baker Street until just after six-thirty. As I got closer, I noticed a tall man wearing a Scotch cap and a coat fastened up to his neck standing outside, illuminated by the light from above the door. The door opened as I arrived, and the two of us were directed upstairs to Holmes' room.\n\n\"You must be Mr. Henry Baker,\" Holmes said, standing up from his chair and greeting our visitor in his usual pleasant manner. \"Please, have a seat by the fire—it’s a chilly night, and I notice you’re more suited to warmer weather. Watson, your timing is perfect. Mr. Baker, is this your hat?\"\n\n\"Yes, that's definitely mine,\" Mr. Baker replied.\n\nHe was a large man with sloped shoulders, a big head, and a broad, intelligent face ending in a pointed, graying beard. His nose and cheeks were tinged red, and the slight shake in his outstretched hand matched Holmes' assumptions about his habits. He wore an old black coat, buttoned to the top with the collar up, and his thin wrists stuck out from his sleeves without cuffs. He spoke slowly and carefully, as someone well-educated but down on his luck.\n\n\"We've kept these possessions for several days,\" Holmes continued, \"expecting you might place an advertisement for them. I'm curious why you didn't.\"\n\nOur guest gave an embarrassed laugh, saying, \"Money’s been tight, and I assumed the rough men who attacked me had stolen both my hat and the goose. I didn’t want to waste more money trying to get them back.\"\n\n\"Understandable. By the way, regarding the bird—we had to eat it.\"\n\n\"Eat it!\" Mr. Baker exclaimed, jumping slightly from his seat.\n\n\"Yes, it would’ve spoiled if we hadn’t. But I can offer you another goose, equally fresh and about the same weight, if that would suit?\"\n\n\"Oh, absolutely,\" Mr. Baker replied with relief.\n\n\"Of course, we still have some remains—feathers, legs, the crop—if you want those—\"\n\nHe laughed heartily. \"They might be nice souvenirs, but otherwise I’m not sure what use they’d be. No, thank you, I’ll just take this fine goose if you don’t mind.\"\n\nHolmes glanced at me with a slight shrug.\n\n\"Here’s your hat and the bird,\" Holmes said. \"Would you mind telling me where the replacement goose came from? I have an interest in poultry and haven't seen better.\"\n\n\"Certainly,\" said Baker, picking up both belongings. \"A few of us gather at the Alpha Inn near the Museum—some of us are at the Museum during the day. Our host this year set up a goose club so, for a small weekly fee, we’d each get a goose at Christmas. I made my payments, and the rest you know. Thank you, sir—a Scotch cap doesn’t suit me at all.\" He bowed to us and left.\n\n\"So much for Mr. Henry Baker,\" Holmes remarked once he was gone. \"He clearly knows nothing more. Now, Watson, are you hungry?\""

Outside, the stars were shining coldly in a cloudless sky, and the breath of the passers-by blew out into smoke like so many pistol shots. Our footfalls rang out crisply and loudly as we swung through the doctors’ quarter, Wimpole Street, Harley Street, and so through Wigmore Street into Oxford Street. In a quarter of an hour we were in Bloomsbury at the Alpha Inn, which is a small public-house at the corner of one of the streets which runs down into Holborn. Holmes pushed open the door of the private bar and ordered two glasses of beer from the ruddy-faced, white-aproned landlord.\n“Your beer should be excellent if it is as good as your geese,” said he.\n“My geese!” The man seemed surprised.\n“Yes. I was speaking only half an hour ago to Mr. Henry Baker, who was a member of your goose club.”\n“Ah! yes, I see. But you see, sir, them’s not our geese.”\n“Indeed!

Well, here’s your good health landlord, and prosperity to your house. Good-night.”\n“Now for Mr. Breckinridge,” he continued, buttoning up his coat as we came out into the frosty air. “Remember, Watson that though we have so homely a thing as a goose at one end of this chain, we have at the other a man who will certainly get seven years’ penal servitude unless we can establish his innocence. It is possible that our inquiry may but confirm his guilt; but, in any case, we have a line of investigation which has been missed by the police, and which a singular chance has placed in our hands. Let us follow it out to the bitter end. Faces to the south, then, and quick march!”",
          "paraphrase_gemini-2.5-flash-preview-04-17": "“Not particularly,” came the reply. “Then,” suggested the speaker, “let's change our dinner into a supper and pursue this lead while it's still fresh.” “By all means,” was the agreement. It was a very cold night, so we bundled up in our heavy coats and wrapped scarves around our necks. Outside, the sky was clear, with stars shining brightly but coldly, and the breath of pedestrians puffed out like tiny clouds of smoke, resembling pistol shots. Our footsteps echoed clearly and loudly as we strode through the medical district, including Wimpole Street and Harley Street, before turning through Wigmore Street and onto Oxford Street. Within fifteen minutes, we arrived in Bloomsbury at the Alpha Inn, a small pub situated on a corner of one of the streets that leads down to Holborn. Holmes pushed open the door to the private bar area and ordered two glasses of beer from the plump-faced landlord wearing a white apron. “Your beer must be excellent if it's anything like your geese,” Holmes remarked. “My geese!” The landlord appeared taken aback. “Yes, I was just speaking a short while ago with Mr. Henry Baker, who was a member of your goose club.” “Ah, yes, I understand. But you see, sir, those weren't our geese.” “Really? Whose were they, then?” “Well, I bought the two dozen from a salesman at Covent Garden.” “Indeed? I know some of the salesmen there. Which one was it?” “His name is Breckinridge.” “Ah, I don't know him. Well, here's to your good health, landlord, and success for your establishment. Good-night.” As we stepped back out into the crisp air, Holmes continued, buttoning his coat, “Now, we turn our attention to Mr. Breckinridge. Remember, Watson, that although this investigation starts with something as ordinary as a goose, at the other end of this chain is a man who is certain to receive seven years in prison unless we can prove his innocence. It's possible our investigation may simply confirm his guilt, but regardless, we have found a line of inquiry that the police overlooked, and which a peculiar twist of fate has put within our grasp. Let's pursue it to its conclusion. Southward we go, and quickly!”",

Outside, the stars shone sharply in a clear sky, and the breath of the people passing by looked like gun smoke in the frigid air. Our footsteps echoed sharply as we made our way through the medical district, along Wimpole Street, Harley Street, then down Wigmore Street and into Oxford Street.

Our inquiry might confirm his guilt, of course, but either way, we have an avenue of investigation that the police have overlooked, brought to us by chance. We must see this through.

One of the largest stalls bore the name of Breckinridge upon it, and the proprietor a horsey-looking man, with a sharp face and trim side-whiskers was helping a boy to put up the shutters.\n“Good-evening. It’s a cold night,” said Holmes.\nThe salesman nodded and shot a questioning glance at my companion.\n“Sold out of geese, I see,” continued Holmes, pointing at the bare slabs of marble.\n“Let you have five hundred to-morrow morning.”\n“That’s no good.”\n“Well, there are some on the stall with the gas-flare.”\n“Ah, but I was recommended to you.”\n“Who by?”\n“The landlord of the Alpha.”\n“Oh, yes; I sent him a couple of dozen.”\n“Fine birds they were, too. Now where did you get them from?”\nTo my surprise the question provoked a burst of anger from the salesman.\n“Now, then, mister,” said he, with his head cocked and his arms akimbo, “what are you driving at? Let’s have it straight, now.”\n“It is straight enough. I should like to know who sold you the geese which you supplied to the Alpha.”\n“Well then, I shan’t tell you. So now!”\n“Oh, it is a matter of no importance; but I don’t know why you should be so warm over such a trifle.”\n“Warm! You’d be as warm, maybe, if you were as pestered as I am. When I pay good money for a good article there should be an end of the business; but it’s ‘Where are the geese?’ and ‘Who did you sell the geese to?’ and ‘What will you take for the geese?’ One would think they were the only geese in the world, to hear the fuss that is made over them.”\n“Well, I have no connection with any other people who have been making inquiries,” said Holmes carelessly. “If you won’t tell us the bet is off, that is all. But I’m always ready to back my opinion on a matter of fowls, and I have a fiver on it that the bird I ate is country bred.”\n“Well, then, you’ve lost your fiver, for it’s town bred,” snapped the salesman.\n“It’s nothing of the kind.”\n“I say it is.”\n“I don’t believe it.”\n“D’you think you know more about fowls than I, who have handled them ever since I was a nipper? I tell you, all those birds that went to the Alpha were town bred.”\n“You’ll never persuade me to believe that.”\n“Will you bet, then?”\n“It’s merely taking your money, for I know that I am right. But I’ll have a sovereign on with you, just to teach you not to be obstinate.”\nThe salesman chuckled grimly. “Bring me the books, Bill,” said he.\nThe small boy brought round a small thin volume and a great greasy-backed one, laying them out together beneath the hanging lamp.\n“Now then, Mr. Cocksure,” said the salesman, “I thought that I was out of geese, but before I finish you’ll find that there is still one left in my shop. You see this little book?”\n“Well?”\n“That’s the list of the folk from whom I buy. D’you see? Well, then, here on this page are the country folk, and the numbers after their names are where their accounts are in the big ledger. Now, then! You see this other page in red ink? Well, that is a list of my town suppliers. Now, look at that third name. Just read it out to me.”\n“Mrs. Oakshott, 117, Brixton Road—249,” read Holmes.\n“Quite so. Now turn that up in the ledger.”\nHolmes turned to the page indicated. “Here you are, ‘Mrs. Oakshott, 117, Brixton Road, egg and poultry supplier.’”\n“Now, then, what’s the last entry?”\n“‘December 22nd. Twenty-four geese at 7s. 6d.’”\n“Quite so. There you are. And underneath?”\n“‘Sold to Mr. Windigate of the Alpha, at 12s.’”\n“What have you to say now?”\nSherlock Holmes looked deeply chagrined. He drew a sovereign from his pocket and threw it down upon the slab, turning away with the air of a man whose disgust is too deep for words. A few yards off he stopped under a lamp-post and laughed in the hearty, noiseless fashion which was peculiar to him.\n“When you see a man with whiskers of that cut and the ‘Pink ’un’ protruding out of his pocket, you can always draw him by a bet,” said he. “I daresay that if I had put £ 100 down in front of him, that man would not have given me such complete information as was drawn from him by the idea that he was doing me on a wager. Well, Watson, we are, I fancy, nearing the end of our quest, and the only point which remains to be determined is whether we should go on to this Mrs. Oakshott to-night, or whether we should reserve it for to-morrow. It is clear from what that surly fellow said that there are others besides ourselves who are anxious about the matter, and I should—”",

Holmes greeted him, commenting on the cold evening. The seller responded with a nod and a questioning look towards me. \"No geese left, I see,\" Holmes continued, pointing to the empty display counters. \"I can sell you five hundred tomorrow morning,\" the man offered. \"That won't work,\" Holmes replied. \"Well, there are some at the stall with the gas lamp,\" the salesman suggested. \"Ah, but you were recommended to me,\" said Holmes. \"By whom?\" the seller asked. \"The landlord of the Alpha,\" Holmes stated. \"Oh, yes, I supplied him with a couple of dozen,\" the man confirmed. \"They were excellent birds,\" Holmes remarked. \"Where did you get them from?\" To my surprise, this question clearly annoyed the salesman. \"Now, look here, mister,\" he said, standing with his head tilted and hands on his hips, \"what exactly are you getting at? Just say what you mean.\" \"It's perfectly clear,\" Holmes countered. \"I simply want to know who sold you the geese you provided to the Alpha.\" \"Well, then, I'm not going to tell you. So there!\" \"Oh, it's not that important,\" Holmes said dismissively, \"but I don't understand why you're getting so heated about such a small thing.\" \"Heated! You'd be just as heated if you were bothered as much as I am! When I pay good money for a good product, that should be the end of it. But instead, it's 'Where are the geese?' and 'Who did you sell the geese to?' and 'How much for the geese?' You'd think they were the only geese in existence with all the fuss.\" \"Well, I have nothing to do with anyone else who has been asking questions,\" Holmes said casually. \"If you won't tell us, the bet is off, that's all. But I'm quite confident in my knowledge of poultry, and I'll wager five pounds that the bird I ate was raised in the countryside.\" \"Then you've lost your five pounds, because it was raised in the city,\" the salesman retorted sharply. \"That's not true,\" Holmes insisted. \"Yes, it is,\" the man snapped back. \"I don't believe it,\" Holmes challenged. \"Do you think you know more about fowl than me, someone who's handled them since childhood? I'm telling you, all the birds that went to the Alpha were raised in the city.\" \"You'll never convince me of that,\" Holmes said. \"Care to bet on it, then?\" the salesman pressed. \"It would just be taking your money, as I know I'm right,\" Holmes replied. \"But I'll bet a sovereign, just to show you not to be so stubborn.\" The salesman let out a grim chuckle. \"Bring the books, Bill,\" he instructed. The young boy fetched a small, thin book and a larger one with a greasy cover, placing them under the hanging lamp. \"Alright, Mr. Know-it-all,\" the salesman said, \"I thought I was out of geese, but before we're done, you'll see there's one left in my shop yet. See this small book?\" \"Yes?\" Holmes replied. \"That's where I list the people I buy from. See? On this page are the suppliers from the country, and the numbers next to their names tell you where their accounts are in the big ledger. Now! See this other page in red ink? That's my list of suppliers from the city. Now, look at the third name there. Read it aloud.\" \"Mrs. Oakshott, 117, Brixton Road—249,\" Holmes read. \"Exactly. Now, look that up in the ledger.\" Holmes turned to the specified page. \"Here it is: 'Mrs. Oakshott, 117, Brixton Road, egg and poultry supplier.'\" \"Good. What's the last entry?\" \"'December 22nd. Twenty-four geese at 7s. 6d.'\" \"Precisely. There you have it. And below that?\" \"'Sold to Mr. Windigate of the Alpha, at 12s.'\" \"What do you say now?\" Sherlock Holmes appeared genuinely disappointed. He took a sovereign from his pocket, placed it on the counter, and turned away with the look of someone too disgusted to speak. A short distance away, he stopped under a lamppost and laughed in his usual hearty, silent manner. \"When you see a man with side-whiskers like that and the 'Pink 'un' (a sporting paper) sticking out of his pocket,\" he said, \"you can always get information out of him with a bet. I'm sure if I had offered him a hundred pounds, that man wouldn't have given me information as willingly as he did thinking he was winning a wager. Well, Watson, I think we are close to solving this case. The only remaining decision is whether we visit this Mrs. Oakshott tonight or wait until tomorrow. It's clear from what that unfriendly fellow said that others besides us are interested in this matter, and I believe—\"",

The largest stall displayed the name Breckinridge, and the owner, a sharp-faced man with neat side-whiskers and a horsey demeanor, was assisting a lad in closing up for the night. \n\n\"Good evening. It’s chilly out,\" Holmes greeted.\nThe vendor merely nodded, eyeing Holmes suspiciously.\n\n\"Looks like you’re out of geese,\" Holmes remarked, indicating the empty marble counters.\n\"Could get you five hundred in the morning.\"\n\"That’s of no use.\"\n\"There are still some at the stall under the gaslight.\"\n\"Yes, but you were recommended to me.\"\n\"By whom?\"\n\"The Alpha’s landlord.\"\n\"Ah, yes—I supplied him with a couple dozen.\"\n\"They were excellent birds. Where did you get them?\"\nSurprisingly, the question angered the vendor.\n\n\"Now listen here,\" he said, standing with arms akimbo, \"what are you after? Out with it.\"\n\"It’s simple enough. I want to know who provided the geese you sold to the Alpha.\"\n\"Well, I’m not telling. That’s that!\"\n\n\"It’s not important,\" Holmes replied mildly, \"but I don’t see why you’re so bothered by such a small matter.\"\n\"Bothered! You would be too if you were harassed as much as I am. I pay proper money for quality goods, and that should be it, but it’s constantly, ‘Where are the geese?’ ‘Who did you sell them to?’ ‘How much for the geese?’ You’d think they were the last geese on earth, given all the fuss.\"\n\n\"I’m not in touch with anyone else who’s made inquiries,\" Holmes said nonchalantly. \"If you won’t tell us, the wager’s off. Still, I back my judgement on poultry, and I’ve got a fiver riding that the goose I ate was country bred.\"\n\n\"Then you’ve lost your bet—it was town bred,\" snapped the vendor.\n\"I don’t accept that.\"\n\"I say it was.\"\n\"I can’t believe it.\"\n\"Do you think you know more about poultry than I do? I’ve handled them since childhood. All the geese to the Alpha came from town sources.\"\n\"You’ll never convince me.\"\n\"Care to bet?\"\n\n\"It’s easy money for you because I know I’m right. But I’ll wager a sovereign just to prove my point.\"\n\nThe salesman gave a wry laugh. \"Bring the books, Bill.\"\nThe boy brought out a thin book and a large, greasy ledger, placing them under the lamp.\n\n\"Alright, Mr. Know-it-all,\" said the vendor, \"I may be out of geese, but there’s one left here for you. See this little book? That lists my suppliers. On this page are the country folk, matched by account numbers. This page in red ink—that’s my town suppliers. Look at the third name. Read it.\"\n\n\"Mrs. Oakshott, 117, Brixton Road—249,\" Holmes recited.\n\"Just so. Now look that up in the ledger.\"\n\nHolmes found the entry: \"Mrs. Oakshott, 117, Brixton Road, egg and poultry supplier.\"\n\"What does the last entry say?\"\n\"December 22nd. Twenty-four geese at seven shillings sixpence.\"\n\"Exactly. And below that?\"\n\"Sold to Mr. Windigate of the Alpha, at twelve shillings.\"\n\"What do you say to that now?\"\n\nHolmes looked quite disappointed. He drew a sovereign from his pocket, tossed it onto the counter, and walked away, his face showing silent annoyance. A few steps away, he stopped underneath a lamp-post and burst into one of his soft, hearty laughs.\n\n\"If you ever spot a man with side-whiskers like that and the ‘Pink ’un’ sticking out of his pocket, you can always coax out information with a bet,\" he told me. \"Even had I offered him a hundred pounds, that man wouldn’t have given me what I just got by pretending it was all a wager. Anyway, Watson, we’re close to the end of our case. The last thing to decide is whether we should visit this Mrs. Oakshott tonight or wait until tomorrow. From what that gruff fellow said, it’s clear that we’re not the only ones interested in this matter, so I think—”"

Turning round we saw a little rat-faced fellow standing in the centre of the circle of yellow light which was thrown by the swinging lamp, while Breckinridge, the salesman, framed in the door of his stall, was shaking his fists fiercely at the cringing figure.\n“I’ve had enough of you and your geese,” he shouted. “I wish you were all at the devil together. If you come pestering me any more with your silly talk I’ll set the dog at you. You bring Mrs. Oakshott here and I’ll answer her, but what have you to do with it? Did I buy the geese off you?”\n“No; but one of them was mine all the same,” whined the little man.\n“Well, then, ask Mrs. Oakshott for it.”\n“She told me to ask you.”\n“Well, you can ask the King of Proosia, for all I care. I’ve had enough of it. Get out of this!” He rushed fiercely forward, and the inquirer flitted away into the darkness.\n“Ha! this may save us a visit to Brixton Road,” whispered Holmes. “Come with me, and we will see what is to be made of this fellow.” Striding through the scattered knots of people who lounged round the flaring stalls, my companion speedily overtook the little man and touched him upon the shoulder. He sprang round, and I could see in the gas-light that every vestige of colour had been driven from his face.\n“Who are you, then? What do you want?” he asked in a quavering voice.\n“You will excuse me,” said Holmes blandly, “but I could not help overhearing the questions which you put to the salesman just now. I think that I could be of assistance to you.”\n“You? Who are you? How could you know anything of the matter?”\n“My name is Sherlock Holmes. It is my business to know what other people don’t know.”\n“But you can know nothing of this?”\n“Excuse me, I know everything of it. You are endeavouring to trace some geese which were sold by Mrs. Oakshott, of Brixton Road, to a salesman named Breckinridge, by him in turn to Mr. Windigate, of the Alpha, and by him to his club, of which Mr. Henry Baker is a member.”\n“Oh, sir, you are the very man whom I have longed to meet,” cried the little fellow with outstretched hands and quivering fingers. “I can hardly explain to you how interested I am in this matter.”\nSherlock Holmes hailed a four-wheeler which was passing. “In that case we had better discuss it in a cosy room rather than in this wind-swept market-place,” said he. “But pray tell me, before we go farther, who it is that I have the pleasure of assisting.”\nThe man hesitated for an instant. “My name is John Robinson,” he answered with a sidelong glance.\n“No, no; the real name,” said Holmes sweetly. “It is always awkward doing business with an alias.”\nA flush sprang to the white cheeks of the stranger. “Well then,” said he, “my real name is James Ryder.”\n“Precisely so. Head attendant at the Hotel Cosmopolitan. Pray step into the cab, and I shall soon be able to tell you everything which you would wish to know.”\nThe little man stood glancing from one to the other of us with half-frightened, half-hopeful eyes, as one who is not sure whether he is on the verge of a windfall or of a catastrophe. Then he stepped into the cab, and in half an hour we were back in the sitting-room at Baker Street.

If you bother me again with your stupid talk, I'll set the dog on you. Bring Mrs. Oakshott here, and I'll talk to her, but what business is it of yours?

It was one bird, I imagine in which you were interested—white, with a black bar across the tail.”\nRyder quivered with emotion. “Oh, sir,” he cried, “can you tell me where it went to?”\n“It came here.”\n“Here?”\n“Yes, and a most remarkable bird it proved. I don’t wonder that you should take an interest in it. It laid an egg after it was dead—the bonniest, brightest little blue egg that ever was seen. I have it here in my museum.”\nOur visitor staggered to his feet and clutched the mantelpiece with his right hand. Holmes unlocked his strong-box and held up the blue carbuncle, which shone out like a star, with a cold, brilliant, many-pointed radiance. Ryder stood glaring with a drawn face, uncertain whether to claim or to disown it.\n“The game’s up, Ryder,” said Holmes quietly. “Hold up, man, or you’ll be into the fire! Give him an arm back into his chair, Watson. He’s not got blood enough to go in for felony with impunity. Give him a dash of brandy. So! Now he looks a little more human. What a shrimp it is, to be sure!”\nFor a moment he had staggered and nearly fallen, but the brandy brought a tinge of colour into his cheeks, and he sat staring with frightened eyes at his accuser.\n“I have almost every link in my hands, and all the proofs which I could possibly need, so there is little which you need tell me. Still, that little may as well be cleared up to make the case complete. You had heard, Ryder, of this blue stone of the Countess of Morcar’s?”\n“It was Catherine Cusack who told me of it,” said he in a crackling voice.\n“I see—her ladyship’s waiting-maid. Well, the temptation of sudden wealth so easily acquired was too much for you, as it has been for better men before you; but you were not very scrupulous in the means you used. It seems to me, Ryder, that there is the making of a very pretty villain in you. You knew that this man Horner, the plumber, had been concerned in some such matter before, and that suspicion would rest the more readily upon him. What did you do, then? You made some small job in my lady’s room—you and your confederate Cusack—and you managed that he should be the man sent for. Then, when he had left, you rifled the jewel-case, raised the alarm, and had this unfortunate man arrested. You then—”\nRyder threw himself down suddenly upon the rug and clutched at my companion’s knees. “For God’s sake, have mercy!” he shrieked. “Think of my father! Of my mother! It would break their hearts. I never went wrong before! I never will again. I swear it. I’ll swear it on a Bible. Oh, don’t bring it into court! For Christ’s sake, don’t!”\n“Get back into your chair!” said Holmes sternly. “It is very well to cringe and crawl now, but you thought little enough of this poor Horner in the dock for a crime of which he knew nothing.”\n“I will fly, Mr. Holmes. I will leave the country, sir. Then the charge against him will break down.”\n“Hum! We will talk about that. And now let us hear a true account of the next act. How came the stone into the goose, and how came the goose into the open market? Tell us the truth, for there lies your only hope of safety.”\nRyder passed his tongue over his parched lips. “I will tell you it just as it happened, sir,” said he. “When Horner had been arrested, it seemed to me that it would be best for me to get away with the stone at once, for I did not know at what moment the police might not take it into their heads to search me and my room. There was no place about the hotel where it would be safe. I went out, as if on some commission, and I made for my sister’s house. She had married a man named Oakshott, and lived in Brixton Road, where she fattened fowls for the market. All the way there every man I met seemed to me to be a policeman or a detective; and, for all that it was a cold night, the sweat was pouring down my face before I came to the Brixton Road. My sister asked me what was the matter, and why I was so pale; but I told her that I had been upset by the jewel robbery at the hotel. Then I went into the back yard and smoked a pipe and wondered what it would be best to do.\n“I had a friend once called Maudsley, who went to the bad, and has just been serving his time in Pentonville. One day he had met me, and fell into talk about the ways of thieves, and how they could get rid of what they stole. I knew that he would be true to me, for I knew one or two things about him; so I made up my mind to go right on to Kilburn, where he lived, and take him into my confidence. He would show me how to turn the stone into money. But how to get to him in safety? I thought of the agonies I had gone through in coming from the hotel. I might at any moment be seized and searched, and there would be the stone in my waistcoat pocket. I was leaning against the wall at the time and looking at the geese which were waddling about round my feet, and suddenly an idea came into my head which showed me how I could beat the best detective that ever lived.\n“My sister had told me some weeks before that I might have the pick of her geese for a Christmas present, and I knew that she was always as good as her word. I would take my goose now, and in it I would carry my stone to Kilburn. There was a little shed in the yard, and behind this I drove one of the birds—a fine big one, white, with a barred tail. I caught it, and prying its bill open, I thrust the stone down its throat as far as my finger could reach. The bird gave a gulp, and I felt the stone pass along its gullet and down into its crop. But the creature flapped and struggled, and out came my sister to know what was the matter. As I turned to speak to her the brute broke loose and fluttered off among the others.\n“‘Whatever were you doing with that bird, Jem?’ says she.\n“‘Well,’ said I, ‘you said you’d give me one for Christmas, and I was feeling which was the fattest.’\n“‘Oh,’ says she, ‘we’ve set yours aside for you—Jem’s bird, we call it. It’s the big white one over yonder. There’s twenty-six of them, which makes one for you, and one for us, and two dozen for the market.’\n“‘Thank you, Maggie,’ says I; ‘but if it is all the same to you, I’d rather have that one I was handling just now.’\n“‘The other is a good three pound heavier,’ said she, ‘and we fattened it expressly for you.’\n“‘Never mind. I’ll have the other, and I’ll take it now,’ said I.\n“‘Oh, just as you like,’ said she, a little huffed. ‘Which is it you want, then?’\n“‘That white one with the barred tail, right in the middle of the flock.’\n“‘Oh, very well. Kill it and take it with you.’\n“Well, I did what she said, Mr. Holmes, and I carried the bird all the way to Kilburn. I told my pal what I had done, for he was a man that it was easy to tell a thing like that to. He laughed until he choked, and we got a knife and opened the goose. My heart turned to water, for there was no sign of the stone, and I knew that some terrible mistake had occurred. I left the bird, rushed back to my sister’s, and hurried into the back yard. There was not a bird to be seen there.\n“‘Where are they all, Maggie?’ I cried.\n“‘Gone to the dealer’s, Jem.’\n“‘Which dealer’s?’\n“‘Breckinridge, of Covent Garden.’\n“‘But was there another with a barred tail?’ I asked, ‘the same as the one I chose?’\n“‘Yes, Jem; there were two barred-tailed ones, and I could never tell them apart.’\n“Well, then, of course I saw it all, and I ran off as hard as my feet would carry me to this man Breckinridge; but he had sold the lot at once, and not one word would he tell me as to where they had gone. You heard him yourselves to-night. Well, he has always answered me like that. My sister thinks that I am going mad. Sometimes I think that I am myself. And now—and now I am myself a branded thief, without ever having touched the wealth for which I sold my character. God help me! God help me!” He burst into convulsive sobbing, with his face buried in his hands.",
          "paraphrase_gemini-2.5-flash-preview-04-17": "“We’re here!” Holmes announced cheerfully as we entered the room. “The fire is very welcome in this weather. You appear cold, Mr. Ryder. Please take the comfortable chair. I’ll just slip into my slippers before we deal with this little matter of yours. Now, then! You’re eager to learn what became of those geese?” “Yes, sir.” “Or rather, I suspect, of that *one* goose. It was a single bird that interested you, wasn’t it—a white one with a black stripe across its tail.” Ryder trembled with emotion. “Oh, sir,” he cried, “can you tell me where it ended up?” “It came here.” “Here?” “Yes, and it proved to be a truly remarkable bird. I understand why you have such an interest in it. It laid an egg even after it died—the loveliest, most brilliant little blue egg imaginable. I keep it here in my collection.” Our guest stumbled to his feet and steadied himself by grasping the mantelpiece with his right hand. Holmes unlocked his strong-box and held up the blue carbuncle; it shone brightly like a star, emitting a cold, dazzling, many-pointed light. Ryder stood staring with a drawn face, unsure whether to claim ownership or deny any connection. “The jig is up, Ryder,” Holmes said calmly. “Steady, man, or you’ll fall into the fire! Watson, help him back into his chair. He hasn’t the nerve for a felony with impunity. Give him a little brandy. Good! He looks slightly more human now. What a weakling he is, truly!” For a moment, he had faltered and nearly fallen, but the brandy brought some color back to his cheeks, and he sat staring with frightened eyes at the man accusing him. “I hold almost every clue, and all the evidence I could possibly need, so there’s little you need to tell me. However, clarifying that small part will make the case complete. You had heard, Ryder, about this blue stone belonging to the Countess of Morcar?” “It was Catherine Cusack who told me about it,” he said in a strained voice. “I see—her ladyship’s personal maid. Well, the lure of sudden wealth, so easily obtained, was too much for you, as it has been for better men before you; but you were quite ruthless in your methods. It appears to me, Ryder, that you have the makings of a rather clever villain. You knew that this man Horner, the plumber, had previous involvement in similar affairs, and that suspicion would fall more readily upon him. What did you do, then? You created a minor task in my lady’s room—you and your accomplice Cusack—and ensured that he was the one sent for. Then, after he had left, you stole from the jewel-case, raised the alarm, and had this unfortunate man arrested. You then—” Ryder suddenly threw himself onto the rug and clutched at my companion’s knees. “For heaven’s sake, have mercy!” he shrieked. “Think of my father! Of my mother! It would break their hearts. I’ve never done anything wrong before! I never will again. I swear it. I’ll swear it on a Bible. Oh, don’t take it to court! For Christ’s sake, don’t!” “Get back in your chair!” Holmes said sternly. “It’s easy to grovel now, but you gave little thought to this poor Horner in the dock for a crime he knew nothing about.” “I’ll leave, Mr. Holmes. I’ll leave the country, sir. Then the charge against him will collapse.” “Hmm! We can discuss that. And now, let’s hear an honest account of the next part. How did the stone end up in the goose, and how did the goose end up in the public market? Tell us the truth, for that is your only hope of safety.” Ryder ran his tongue over his dry lips. “I’ll tell you exactly how it happened, sir,” he said. “After Horner was arrested, I felt it was best for me to get away with the stone immediately, because I didn’t know when the police might decide to search me and my room. There was no safe place at the hotel. I went out, pretending to be on an errand, and headed for my sister’s house. She was married to a man named Oakshott and lived on Brixton Road, where she raised chickens and geese for sale. All the way there, every man I saw seemed like a policeman or a detective; and, despite it being a cold night, sweat was pouring down my face before I reached Brixton Road. My sister asked me what was wrong and why I was so pale; but I told her I was just shaken by the jewel theft at the hotel. Then I went into the backyard, smoked my pipe, and wondered what the best course of action would be. “I once had a friend called Maudsley, who turned to crime and had just served time in Pentonville prison. One day he had run into me and started talking about how thieves operated and how they disposed of stolen goods. I knew I could trust him, because I knew a few things about his past; so I decided to go straight to Kilburn, where he lived, and confide in him. He would show me how to sell the stone for money. But how could I get to him safely? I thought about the torment I had endured coming from the hotel. I could be stopped and searched at any moment, and the stone would be right there in my waistcoat pocket. I was leaning against the wall at the time, watching the geese waddling around my feet, and suddenly an idea struck me that seemed foolproof—a way to outsmart the cleverest detective alive. “My sister had mentioned a few weeks earlier that I could choose any of her geese as a Christmas gift, and I knew she always kept her word. I would take my goose now, and in it I would carry my stone to Kilburn. There was a small shed in the yard, and I cornered one of the birds behind it—a fine, large one, white, with a barred tail. I caught it, forced its beak open, and pushed the stone down its throat as far as my finger could reach. The bird swallowed, and I felt the stone pass down its gullet and into its crop. But the creature flapped and struggled violently, and my sister came out to see what was happening. As I turned to speak to her, the bird broke free and fluttered off among the others. “‘What on earth were you doing with that bird, Jem?’ she asked. “‘Well,’ I said, ‘you said you’d give me one for Christmas, and I was feeling which was the heaviest.’ “‘Oh,’ she said, ‘we’ve already set yours aside for you—we call it Jem’s bird. It’s the big white one over there. There are twenty-six in total, which makes one for you, one for us, and two dozen for the market.’ “‘Thank you, Maggie,’ I said; ‘but if it’s all the same to you, I’d prefer the one I was just handling.’ “‘The other is a good three pounds heavier,’ she said, ‘and we fattened it specifically for you.’ “‘Never mind. I’ll have the other one, and I’ll take it now,’ I insisted. “‘Oh, suit yourself,’ she said, slightly annoyed. ‘Which one is it you want, then?’ “‘That white one with the barred tail, right in the middle of the flock.’ “‘All right then. Kill it and take it with you.’ “Well, I did as she said, Mr. Holmes, and carried the bird all the way to Kilburn. I explained what I had done to my friend, as he was the sort of man you could easily tell such a thing to. He laughed so hard he choked, and then we got a knife and opened up the goose. My stomach dropped; there was no sign of the stone, and I knew I had made a terrible error. I left the bird, hurried back to my sister’s, and rushed into the backyard. There wasn’t a single bird there. “‘Where have they all gone, Maggie?’ I cried. “‘To the dealer’s, Jem.’ “‘Which dealer?’ “‘Breckinridge, in Covent Garden.’ “‘But was there another one with a barred tail?’ I asked, ‘just like the one I chose?’ “‘Yes, Jem; there were two barred-tailed ones, and I could never tell them apart.’ “Well, then, of course, I understood everything, and I ran as fast as I could to this man Breckinridge; but he had sold the entire lot immediately, and he wouldn’t tell me a single word about where they had gone. You heard him yourselves tonight. He’s always responded to me like that. My sister thinks I’m losing my mind. Sometimes I think I am too. And now—and now I am a marked criminal, without ever having obtained the wealth for which I sacrificed my good name. God help me! God help me!” He burst into uncontrollable sobs, burying his face in his hands.",
          "paraphrase_gpt-4.1-2025-04-14": "As we entered the room, Holmes greeted us brightly and commented on how appropriate the fire was for the cold weather. He noticed that Mr. Ryder looked chilly and invited him to sit in the basket-chair, mentioning he'd put his slippers on before addressing Ryder's concern. Holmes then asked if Ryder wanted to learn the fate of the geese, or, more specifically, a particular goose—white with a black stripe on its tail. Ryder, visibly emotional, asked anxiously if Holmes knew what happened to it. Holmes replied that the goose came to his house, and proved extraordinary; after its death, it produced a beautiful small blue egg, which he now had in his collection. \n\nAt this, Ryder was so shocked he nearly collapsed, clinging to the mantelpiece. Holmes unlocked his strongbox and revealed the blue carbuncle, shining brilliantly. Ryder stared at it, torn between claiming or denying involvement. Holmes calmly told Ryder the situation was exposed and asked Watson to help Ryder, who seemed faint, back to his chair and provide some brandy. The drink revived Ryder slightly, but he watched Holmes fearfully.\n\nHolmes explained to Ryder that he had all the evidence needed, but asked Ryder to fill in the missing details to complete the case. Holmes recounted that Ryder had heard of the Countess of Morcar's blue jewel through Catherine Cusack, her lady's maid, and gave in to temptation, implicating James Horner, a plumber with a criminal past, by orchestrating a small job that would get him sent to the right room and framing him for the theft. \n\nAt this, Ryder collapsed to the floor, clutching Holmes's knees, begging for mercy, swearing he’d never strayed before and never would again, and pleaded not to be taken to court for the sake of his parents. Holmes sternly told him to compose himself and pointed out Ryder hadn’t shown such compassion for Horner. Ryder suggested he could flee the country so the charges against Horner would not stand. Holmes dismissed this for now, and pressed Ryder to explain how the stone ended up inside the goose and how it reached the market.\n\nRyder, parched and anxious, agreed to tell the truth. After Horner’s arrest, fearing a search, Ryder wanted to get rid of the stone and decided to visit his sister, Mrs. Oakshott, who lived in Brixton Road and raised geese for the market. Under the stress of possibly encountering police on the way, he conceived a plan to hide the jewel in a goose; weeks earlier, his sister had promised him one for Christmas. In the backyard, he selected a large white goose with a barred tail, and surreptitiously pushed the jewel down its throat. Just then, his sister interrupted him, and the goose escaped among the others. \n\nWhen his sister asked what he was doing, Ryder pretended he was checking which bird was fattest. Mrs. Oakshott told him his bird was already picked out—a bigger one— but Ryder insisted on the one with the barred tail. His sister relented, and he took the bird to his friend Maudsley, who he knew was familiar with fencing stolen goods. They killed and opened the bird, only to find the stone wasn’t inside. Horror-struck, Ryder realized he’d picked the wrong bird and quickly returned to his sister’s house, but the remaining geese had been sent to a dealer, Breckinridge. He tried to find out from Breckinridge where the birds went, but the dealer refused to tell him. Defeated, Ryder lamented that he had committed the crime, lost his honor, and never even gained the wealth he sacrificed it for, breaking down into sobs."

Of all these varied cases, however, I cannot recall any which presented more singular features than that which was associated with the well-known Surrey family of the Roylotts of Stoke Moran. The events in question occurred in the early days of my association with Holmes, when we were sharing rooms as bachelors in Baker Street. It is possible that I might have placed them upon record before, but a promise of secrecy was made at the time, from which I have only been freed during the last month by the untimely death of the lady to whom the pledge was given. It is perhaps as well that the facts should now come to light, for I have reasons to know that there are widespread rumours as to the death of Dr. Grimesby Roylott which tend to make the matter even more terrible than the truth.\nIt was early in April in the year ’83 that I woke one morning to find Sherlock Holmes standing, fully dressed, by the side of my bed. He was a late riser, as a rule, and as the clock on the mantelpiece showed me that it was only a quarter-past seven, I blinked up at him in some surprise, and perhaps just a little resentment, for I was myself regular in my habits.\n“Very sorry to knock you up, Watson,” said he, “but it’s the common lot this morning. Mrs. Hudson has been knocked up, she retorted upon me, and I on you.”\n“What is it, then—a fire?”\n“No; a client. It seems that a young lady has arrived in a considerable state of excitement, who insists upon seeing me. She is waiting now in the sitting-room. Now, when young ladies wander about the metropolis at this hour of the morning, and knock sleepy people up out of their beds, I presume that it is something very pressing which they have to communicate. Should it prove to be an interesting case, you would, I am sure, wish to follow it from the outset. I thought, at any rate, that I should call you and give you the chance.”\n“My dear fellow, I would not miss it for anything.”\nI had no keener pleasure than in following Holmes in his professional investigations, and in admiring the rapid deductions, as swift as intuitions, and yet always founded on a logical basis with which he unravelled the problems which were submitted to him. I rapidly threw on my clothes and was ready in a few minutes to accompany my friend down to the sitting-room. A lady dressed in black and heavily veiled, who had been sitting in the window, rose as we entered.\n“Good-morning, madam,” said Holmes cheerily. “My name is Sherlock Holmes. This is my intimate friend and associate, Dr. Watson, before whom you can speak as freely as before myself. Ha! I am glad to see that Mrs. Hudson has had the good sense to light the fire. Pray draw up to it, and I shall order you a cup of hot coffee, for I observe that you are shivering.”\n“It is not cold which makes me shiver,” said the woman in a low voice, changing her seat as requested.\n“What, then?”\n“It is fear, Mr. Holmes. It is terror.” She raised her veil as she spoke, and we could see that she was indeed in a pitiable state of agitation, her face all drawn and grey, with restless frightened eyes, like those of some hunted animal. Her features and figure were those of a woman of thirty, but her hair was shot with premature grey, and her expression was weary and haggard. Sherlock Holmes ran her over with one of his quick, all-comprehensive glances.\n“You must not fear,” said he soothingly, bending forward and patting her forearm. “We shall soon set matters right, I have no doubt. You have come in by train this morning, I see.”\n“You know me, then?”\n“No, but I observe the second half of a return ticket in the palm of your left glove. You must have started early, and yet you had a good drive in a dog-cart, along heavy roads, before you reached the station.”\nThe lady gave a violent start and stared in bewilderment at my companion.\n“There is no mystery, my dear madam,” said he, smiling. “The left arm of your jacket is spattered with mud in no less than seven places. The marks are perfectly fresh.",
          "paraphrase_gemini-2.5-flash-preview-04-17": "After reviewing my notes on the seventy or so cases where I observed my friend Sherlock Holmes's methods over the past eight years, I've found many that were tragic, some amusing, numerous cases that were simply odd, but none that were ordinary. This is because Holmes, driven more by his passion for the craft than by a desire for wealth, would only take on investigations that were unusual, even bizarre. However, of all these varied cases, I can't recall any that had stranger characteristics than the one connected with the well-known Surrey family, the Roylotts of Stoke Moran. These events happened early in my time working with Holmes, when we lived together as bachelors on Baker Street. I might have written about them sooner, but I gave a promise of confidentiality at the time, from which I was only recently released last month due to the unexpected death of the lady to whom I made the vow. It's probably for the best that the truth comes out now, as I have reason to believe there are widespread tales about Dr. Grimesby Roylott's death that make the reality seem less grim. It was early in April of '83 when I awoke one morning to find Sherlock Holmes standing fully dressed beside my bed. He typically slept late, and the clock on the mantelpiece showed it was only a quarter past seven, so I looked up at him with some surprise and perhaps a little irritation, being a person of routine myself. 'My apologies for waking you, Watson,' he said, 'but it's catching this morning. Mrs. Hudson was woken up, she woke me, and I've woken you.' 'What is it, then—a fire?' I asked. 'No; a client,' he replied. 'Apparently, a young woman has arrived quite agitated and is insistent on seeing me. She's waiting in the sitting-room now. When young ladies are wandering the city streets at this hour and waking people from their sleep, I assume they have something very urgent to tell me. Should it turn out to be an interesting case, I'm sure you'd want to follow it from the start. At any rate, I thought I should wake you and give you the option.' 'My dear fellow, I wouldn't miss it for anything.' I found no greater pleasure than joining Holmes in his professional inquiries, admiring his quick conclusions, which were as swift as intuition yet always based on sound logic, as he solved the problems presented to him. I quickly put on my clothes and was ready in just a few minutes to accompany my friend downstairs to the sitting-room. A lady dressed in black with a thick veil, who had been sitting by the window, stood up as we entered. 'Good morning, madam,' Holmes said cheerfully. 'My name is Sherlock Holmes. This is my close friend and associate, Dr. Watson, before whom you may speak as freely as before me. Ah! I'm pleased to see Mrs. Hudson was sensible enough to light the fire. Please move closer to it, and I'll order you a cup of hot coffee, as I see you are trembling.' 'It's not the cold that makes me shiver,' the woman said in a quiet voice, moving to the seat as requested. 'What is it, then?' 'It's fear, Mr. Holmes. It's terror.' She lifted her veil as she spoke, and we could see she was indeed in a distressed state, her face pale and strained, with restless, frightened eyes, like a hunted animal. Her features and build were those of a woman around thirty, but her hair was streaked with premature grey, and she looked weary and troubled. Sherlock Holmes observed her with one of his quick, all-encompassing glances. 'You must not be afraid,' he said soothingly, leaning forward and gently patting her forearm. 'We'll sort things out quickly, I'm sure. You arrived by train this morning, I see.' 'You know me, then?' 'No,' he replied, 'but I notice the return half of a ticket in the palm of your left glove. You must have set out early, yet you had a considerable ride in a dog-cart, on muddy roads, before you reached the station.' The lady gave a violent start and stared at my companion in confusion. 'There's no mystery, my dear madam,' he said, smiling. 'The left sleeve of your jacket has no less than seven mud spatters. The marks are completely fresh.",
          "paraphrase_gpt-4.1-2025-04-14": "As I look back over my notes of the more than seventy cases I have observed with my friend Sherlock Holmes over the past eight years, I see that many were tragic, some amusing, and a great many simply odd, but never ordinary. Holmes pursued his work more for the love of it than for money, and he always rejected routine cases, preferring those that were unusual or even bizarre. Of all these varied experiences, none stands out as more peculiar than the one involving the distinguished Surrey family, the Roylotts of Stoke Moran. The events in question took place early in my partnership with Holmes, when we were both bachelors living on Baker Street. I might have recorded the story sooner, but I had promised to keep it secret, a promise only recently released due to the unexpected death of the lady involved. Now that there are widespread rumors surrounding the death of Dr. Grimesby Roylott, some worse than the truth, it seems fitting to reveal what truly happened.\n\nIt was an early morning in April 1883 when I woke to find Sherlock Holmes, already dressed, standing by my bed. Usually a late riser, Holmes’s presence surprised me, especially since it was only a quarter past seven. He apologized for waking me, explaining that Mrs. Hudson had been woken herself and so had come to him, prompting him now to rouse me. When I asked if there was a fire, he explained that a young lady, quite agitated, was in our sitting room insisting on seeing him. Holmes remarked that if someone is roaming London at this hour waking people from their sleep, there must be urgent business. If it turned out to be interesting, he knew I would want to be involved from the start, so he gave me the opportunity to join in. I assured him that I would not want to miss it for anything.\n\nFollowing Holmes’s cases and watching his quick, intuitive, yet logical deductions always gave me great joy. I dressed quickly and followed him to the sitting room, where a woman dressed in black, her face hidden by a thick veil, stood up as we entered. Holmes greeted her warmly, introduced himself and me, assuring her she could speak just as freely before me. Noticing that Mrs. Hudson had lit a fire, he invited the lady to sit by it and offered her coffee, observing that she was shivering. She replied in a low tone that it was not the cold, but fear, that made her tremble. Lifting her veil, we saw that she was indeed deeply distressed—her face pale and drawn, her eyes wide with fright like a hunted animal. Although appearing to be around thirty, her hair was prematurely gray and her expression tired and anxious. Holmes gave her a thorough, quick glance.\n\nHe gently reassured her not to be afraid, confident that they could sort things out, and then pointed out that she must have arrived by train that morning. Surprised, the woman asked if he already knew her. Holmes clarified that he had simply observed the second half of a return ticket in her glove and deduced she had traveled early, with a long drive by dog-cart over muddy roads to the station, based on the fresh splashes on her coat sleeve. The woman seemed startled and bewildered by his insights. Holmes just smiled and explained there was nothing mysterious—he had simply observed the fresh mud spots."

Sir, I can stand this strain no longer; I shall go mad if it continues. I have no one to turn to—none, save only one, who cares for me, and he, poor fellow, can be of little aid. I have heard of you, Mr. Holmes; I have heard of you from Mrs. Farintosh, whom you helped in the hour of her sore need. It was from her that I had your address. Oh, sir, do you not think that you could help me, too, and at least throw a little light through the dense darkness which surrounds me? At present it is out of my power to reward you for your services, but in a month or six weeks I shall be married, with the control of my own income, and then at least you shall not find me ungrateful.”\nHolmes turned to his desk and, unlocking it, drew out a small case-book, which he consulted.\n“Farintosh,” said he. “Ah yes, I recall the case; it was concerned with an opal tiara. I think it was before your time, Watson. I can only say, madam, that I shall be happy to devote the same care to your case as I did to that of your friend. As to reward, my profession is its own reward; but you are at liberty to defray whatever expenses I may be put to, at the time which suits you best. And now I beg that you will lay before us everything that may help us in forming an opinion upon the matter.”\n“Alas!” replied our visitor, “the very horror of my situation lies in the fact that my fears are so vague, and my suspicions depend so entirely upon small points, which might seem trivial to another, that even he to whom of all others I have a right to look for help and advice looks upon all that I tell him about it as the fancies of a nervous woman. He does not say so, but I can read it from his soothing answers and averted eyes. But I have heard, Mr. Holmes, that you can see deeply into the manifold wickedness of the human heart. You may advise me how to walk amid the dangers which encompass me.”\n“I am all attention, madam.”\n“My name is Helen Stoner, and I am living with my stepfather, who is the last survivor of one of the oldest Saxon families in England, the Roylotts of Stoke Moran, on the western border of Surrey.”\nHolmes nodded his head. “The name is familiar to me,” said he.\n“The family was at one time among the richest in England, and the estates extended over the borders into Berkshire in the north, and Hampshire in the west. In the last century, however, four successive heirs were of a dissolute and wasteful disposition, and the family ruin was eventually completed by a gambler in the days of the Regency. Nothing was left save a few acres of ground, and the two-hundred-year-old house, which is itself crushed under a heavy mortgage. The last squire dragged out his existence there, living the horrible life of an aristocratic pauper; but his only son, my stepfather, seeing that he must adapt himself to the new conditions, obtained an advance from a relative, which enabled him to take a medical degree and went out to Calcutta, where, by his professional skill and his force of character, he established a large practice. In a fit of anger, however, caused by some robberies which had been perpetrated in the house, he beat his native butler to death and narrowly escaped a capital sentence. As it was, he suffered a long term of imprisonment and afterwards returned to England a morose and disappointed man.\n“When Dr. Roylott was in India he married my mother, Mrs. Stoner, the young widow of Major-General Stoner, of the Bengal Artillery. My sister Julia and I were twins, and we were only two years old at the time of my mother’s re-marriage. She had a considerable sum of money—not less than £ 1000 a year—and this she bequeathed to Dr. Roylott entirely while we resided with him, with a provision that a certain annual sum should be allowed to each of us in the event of our marriage. Shortly after our return to England my mother died—she was killed eight years ago in a railway accident near Crewe. Dr. Roylott then abandoned his attempts to establish himself in practice in London and took us to live with him in the old ancestral house at Stoke Moran. The money which my mother had left was enough for all our wants, and there seemed to be no obstacle to our happiness.\n“But a terrible change came over our stepfather about this time. Instead of making friends and exchanging visits with our neighbours, who had at first been overjoyed to see a Roylott of Stoke Moran back in the old family seat, he shut himself up in his house and seldom came out save to indulge in ferocious quarrels with whoever might cross his path. Violence of temper approaching to mania has been hereditary in the men of the family, and in my stepfather’s case it had, I believe, been intensified by his long residence in the tropics. A series of disgraceful brawls took place, two of which ended in the police-court, until at last he became the terror of the village, and the folks would fly at his approach, for he is a man of immense strength, and absolutely uncontrollable in his anger.\n“Last week he hurled the local blacksmith over a parapet into a stream, and it was only by paying over all the money which I could gather together that I was able to avert another public exposure. He had no friends at all save the wandering gipsies, and he would give these vagabonds leave to encamp upon the few acres of bramble-covered land which represent the family estate, and would accept in return the hospitality of their tents, wandering away with them sometimes for weeks on end. He has a passion also for Indian animals, which are sent over to him by a correspondent, and he has at this moment a cheetah and a baboon, which wander freely over his grounds and are feared by the villagers almost as much as their master.\n“You can imagine from what I say that my poor sister Julia and I had no great pleasure in our lives. No servant would stay with us, and for a long time we did all the work of the house. She was but thirty at the time of her death, and yet her hair had already begun to whiten, even as mine has.”\n“Your sister is dead, then?”\n“She died just two years ago, and it is of her death that I wish to speak to you. You can understand that, living the life which I have described, we were little likely to see anyone of our own age and position. We had, however, an aunt, my mother’s maiden sister, Miss Honoria Westphail, who lives near Harrow, and we were occasionally allowed to pay short visits at this lady’s house. Julia went there at Christmas two years ago, and met there a half-pay major of marines, to whom she became engaged. My stepfather learned of the engagement when my sister returned and offered no objection to the marriage; but within a fortnight of the day which had been fixed for the wedding, the terrible event occurred which has deprived me of my only companion.”",
          "paraphrase_gemini-2.5-flash-preview-04-17": "Your vehicle must have been a dog-cart, as only that type of conveyance splashes mud upwards in such a manner, particularly when the occupant is seated on the driver's left side.”“Regardless of your reasoning, you are absolutely correct,” she replied. “I left my home before six o'clock, reached Leatherhead at twenty past, and took the earliest train to Waterloo. Sir, I cannot endure this stress any longer; I will lose my mind if it persists. I have no one else to rely on—no one except for a single person who cares for me, and he, unfortunately, can offer little assistance. I have heard about you, Mr. Holmes; Mrs. Farintosh, whom you aided during her critical time of need, spoke of you. She provided me with your address. Oh, sir, do you believe you could help me as well, and at least shed some light on the deep obscurity surrounding me? Currently, I am unable to compensate you for your services, but I expect to be married in a month or six weeks and gain control of my own finances, and then you will certainly find me appreciative.”Holmes turned to his desk, unlocked it, and took out a small record book, which he consulted.“Farintosh,” he said. “Ah yes, I remember the case; it involved an opal tiara. I believe that was before your time, Watson. I can only tell you, madam, that I will gladly apply the same diligence to your case as I did to your friend's. Regarding payment, my work is its own reward; however, you are welcome to cover any expenses I incur at a time most convenient for you. Now, I ask you to share everything that might assist us in forming an opinion on the matter.”“Regrettably,” our visitor responded, “the very terror of my situation lies in the fact that my fears are so ill-defined, and my suspicions hinge so entirely on minor details that might seem insignificant to others. Even the person I have the most right to turn to for help and guidance dismisses everything I tell him about it as the imaginings of a nervous woman. He doesn't state it explicitly, but I can discern it from his placating responses and averted gaze. But I have heard, Mr. Holmes, that you possess a profound understanding of the diverse wickedness within the human heart. Perhaps you can advise me on how to navigate the dangers that surround me.”“I am listening attentively, madam.”“My name is Helen Stoner, and I reside with my stepfather, who is the last surviving member of one of England's most ancient Saxon lineages, the Roylotts of Stoke Moran, located near the western boundary of Surrey.”Holmes nodded. “That name is familiar to me,” he stated.“The family was once among the wealthiest in England, and their estates extended into Berkshire to the north and Hampshire to the west. However, during the last century, four consecutive heirs were profligate and wasteful, and the family's financial ruin was ultimately sealed by a gambler during the Regency period. All that remained were a few acres of land and the two-hundred-year-old house, which itself is burdened by a substantial mortgage. The previous squire lived out his days there, enduring the grim existence of an impoverished aristocrat; but his only son, my stepfather, recognizing the need to adapt to new circumstances, secured funds from a relative. This allowed him to earn a medical degree and travel to Calcutta, where his professional skill and strong will enabled him to build a large practice. Nevertheless, in a fit of rage provoked by several robberies that had occurred in the house, he fatally beat his native butler and narrowly avoided a death sentence. As it was, he served a lengthy prison term and subsequently returned to England a bitter and disillusioned man.“While Dr. Roylott was in India, he married my mother, Mrs. Stoner, the young widow of Major-General Stoner of the Bengal Artillery. My sister Julia and I were twins, and we were only two years old when my mother remarried. She possessed a considerable inheritance—no less than £1000 a year—which she left entirely to Dr. Roylott as long as we lived with him, with a stipulation that each of us would receive a specific annual sum upon our marriage. Shortly after we returned to England, my mother died—she was killed eight years ago in a train accident near Crewe. Dr. Roylott then gave up his attempts to establish a practice in London and brought us to live with him at the old family house in Stoke Moran. The money my mother had left was sufficient for all our needs, and there seemed to be no impediment to our happiness.“But a dreadful transformation came over our stepfather around this time. Instead of socializing and visiting with our neighbours, who had initially been delighted to see a Roylott of Stoke Moran back at the ancestral home, he isolated himself in the house and rarely ventured out unless it was to engage in fierce disputes with anyone who crossed his path. A violent temperament, almost bordering on madness, has been a hereditary trait in the men of the family, and in my stepfather's case, I believe it was intensified by his prolonged stay in the tropics. A series of shameful altercations ensued, two of which resulted in court appearances, until eventually, he became the terror of the village, and people would flee when they saw him approaching, for he is a man of immense physical power and completely uncontrollable when angry.“Last week, he threw the local blacksmith over a wall into a stream, and only by pooling together all the money I could find was I able to prevent another public scandal. He had no friends except for the itinerant gypsies; he would grant these vagrants permission to set up camp on the few acres of overgrown land that constitute the family estate and, in return, would accept their hospitality in their tents, sometimes wandering off with them for weeks at a time. He also has a fascination for Indian animals, which are sent to him by a contact, and currently owns a cheetah and a baboon that roam freely on his property and are almost as feared by the villagers as he is.“From what I've described, you can imagine that my poor sister Julia and I did not enjoy much happiness in our lives. No servants would stay with us, and for a long period, we managed all the household chores ourselves. She was only thirty when she died, yet her hair had already begun to turn grey, just as mine has.”“Your sister is deceased, then?”“She passed away exactly two years ago, and it is about her death that I wish to speak to you. You can understand that, living the isolated life I have described, we were unlikely to meet anyone our own age or social standing. However, we did have an aunt, my mother’s unmarried sister, Miss Honoria Westphail, who lives near Harrow, and we were occasionally permitted to make short visits to her home. Julia went there at Christmas two years ago and met a retired major of marines, to whom she became engaged. My stepfather was informed of the engagement upon my sister's return and did not object to the marriage; but within two weeks of the date set for the wedding, the dreadful event occurred that took away my only companion.”",
          "paraphrase_gpt-4.1-2025-04-14": "No other type of carriage but a dog-cart splashes mud like that, and even then, it only does so if you’re seated to the left of the driver.”\n\n“Whatever your reasons, you’re absolutely right,” she replied. “I left home before six, arrived at Leatherhead by twenty past, and took the first train to Waterloo. I can’t endure this anxiety any longer—I fear I’ll lose my wits if it goes on. There’s no one I can go to for help, except for one person who cares for me, but, poor soul, he can’t do much. I’ve heard about you, Mr. Holmes, from Mrs. Farintosh, whom you aided when she was in distress. She gave me your address. Please, can you help me? Can you at least shed some light on the confusion that surrounds me? Right now I can’t repay you, but in a month or six weeks I’m to be married, and will have control over my own income, so you’ll see I’m grateful.”\n\nHolmes turned to his desk, unlocked it, and took out a small notebook for reference.\n\n“Farintosh,” he said. “Ah yes, I remember now—it concerned an opal tiara. That was before your time, Watson. Madam, I promise to dedicate the same diligence to your case as I did for your friend. As for payment, my work is its own reward; but you’re welcome to settle any expenses incurred at your convenience. Now please, tell us everything you think might help us understand your situation.”\n\n“Alas!” the visitor replied. “The horror of my situation is that my fears are so uncertain, and my suspicions based on such small details that others might dismiss them as insignificant. Even the one person I should be able to rely on simply treats my concerns as the imaginings of a nervous woman. He doesn’t say as much, but his comforting answers and averted gaze make it plain. But I’ve heard, Mr. Holmes, that you are adept at uncovering hidden evil. Please advise me as I try to avoid the dangers surrounding me.”\n\n“I’m listening, madam.”\n\n“My name is Helen Stoner, and I live with my stepfather, the last member of the Roylott family of Stoke Moran, an ancient Saxon family in Surrey.”\n\nHolmes nodded. “I know the name,” he said.\n\n“The family was once very wealthy, owning land as far as Berkshire in the north and Hampshire in the west. But over the last century, four heirs lost the fortune through reckless and wasteful behavior. The last blow was dealt by a gambler in the Regency era, leaving only a few acres and the centuries-old house, heavily mortgaged. The last squire lived out his days as an impoverished aristocrat, but his only son, my stepfather, adapted. He borrowed funds from a relative, trained as a doctor, and practiced medicine in Calcutta, where he was successful due to his talent and strong will. However, after an incident involving thefts at his residence, he killed his native servant in a rage, nearly receiving the death penalty, but instead served a long prison term. He returned to England, embittered and withdrawn.\n\n“While in India, Dr. Roylott married my mother, the widow of Major-General Stoner of the Bengal Artillery. My twin sister Julia and I were two years old at that time. My mother had a sizeable income—no less than a thousand pounds a year—which she left to Dr. Roylott, provided he cared for us, with the requirement that we each receive an allowance upon marriage. Not long after we came back to England, my mother died in a railway accident near Crewe, eight years ago. Dr. Roylott then gave up trying to practice in London and instead moved us to the old family home at Stoke Moran. The inheritance gave us enough to live comfortably, and for a while, nothing seemed to threaten our happiness.\n\n“But at that time, my stepfather became a changed man. Instead of befriending neighbors, who were initially pleased to see a Roylott return, he isolated himself and emerged only to engage in violent disputes with anyone he encountered. A tendency toward uncontrollable anger had long run in the family, and in him it was worsened by years living in the tropics. He was involved in several shameful fights—two ended in court—until he became feared by everyone in the village. People would avoid him, because he was enormously strong and extremely unpredictable.\n\n“Just last week, he flung the blacksmith into a stream; I had to spend all I could to prevent a scandal. He has no friends except for wandering gypsies, whom he allows to camp on our land in exchange for their hospitality. Sometimes he wanders off with them for weeks. He’s also fond of exotic animals sent from India, and currently has a cheetah and a baboon roaming the grounds, who frighten the locals nearly as much as he does.\n\n“As you can imagine, my sister Julia and I had little joy in our lives. No staff would stay on, so we did all the work ourselves. Julia was thirty when she died, but her hair had already started to turn white, just as mine has.”\n\n“Your sister has died?”\n\n“Yes, she passed away two years ago, and it is regarding her death that I seek your help. Due to our isolated lifestyle, we rarely met people our own age or status. We had an aunt, our mother’s unmarried sister, Miss Honoria Westphail, living near Harrow, and we sometimes visited her. Julia visited at Christmas two years ago and became engaged to a former Marine major. Our stepfather raised no objection to the engagement, but within two weeks of the wedding date came the dreadful event that took my only companion away.”"

          "text_segment": "Sherlock Holmes had been leaning back in his chair with his eyes closed and his head sunk in a cushion, but he half opened his lids now and glanced across at his visitor.\n“Pray be precise as to details,” said he.\n“It is easy for me to be so, for every event of that dreadful time is seared into my memory. The manor-house is, as I have already said, very old, and only one wing is now inhabited. The bedrooms in this wing are on the ground floor, the sitting-rooms being in the central block of the buildings. Of these bedrooms the first is Dr. Roylott’s, the second my sister’s, and the third my own. There is no communication between them, but they all open out into the same corridor. Do I make myself plain?”\n“Perfectly so.”\n“The windows of the three rooms open out upon the lawn. That fatal night Dr. Roylott had gone to his room early, though we knew that he had not retired to rest, for my sister was troubled by the smell of the strong Indian cigars which it was his custom to smoke. She left her room, therefore, and came into mine, where she sat for some time, chatting about her approaching wedding. At eleven o’clock she rose to leave me, but she paused at the door and looked back.\n“‘Tell me, Helen,’ said she, ‘have you ever heard anyone whistle in the dead of the night?’\n“‘Never,’ said I.\n“‘I suppose that you could not possibly whistle, yourself, in your sleep?’\n“‘Certainly not. But why?’\n“‘Because during the last few nights I have always, about three in the morning, heard a low, clear whistle. I am a light sleeper, and it has awakened me. I cannot tell where it came from—perhaps from the next room, perhaps from the lawn. I thought that I would just ask you whether you had heard it.’\n“‘No, I have not. It must be those wretched gipsies in the plantation.’\n“‘Very likely. And yet if it were on the lawn, I wonder that you did not hear it also.’\n“‘Ah, but I sleep more heavily than you.’\n“‘Well, it is of no great consequence, at any rate.’ She smiled back at me, closed my door, and a few moments later I heard her key turn in the lock.”\n“Indeed,” said Holmes. “Was it your custom always to lock yourselves in at night?”\n“Always.”\n“And why?”\n“I think that I mentioned to you that the Doctor kept a cheetah and a baboon. We had no feeling of security unless our doors were locked.”\n“Quite so. Pray proceed with your statement.”\n“I could not sleep that night. A vague feeling of impending misfortune impressed me. My sister and I, you will recollect, were twins, and you know how subtle are the links which bind two souls which are so closely allied. It was a wild night. The wind was howling outside, and the rain was beating and splashing against the windows. Suddenly, amid all the hubbub of the gale, there burst forth the wild scream of a terrified woman. I knew that it was my sister’s voice. I sprang from my bed, wrapped a shawl round me, and rushed into the corridor. As I opened my door I seemed to hear a low whistle, such as my sister described, and a few moments later a clanging sound, as if a mass of metal had fallen. As I ran down the passage, my sister’s door was unlocked, and revolved slowly upon its hinges. I stared at it horror-stricken, not knowing what was about to issue from it. By the light of the corridor-lamp I saw my sister appear at the opening, her face blanched with terror, her hands groping for help, her whole figure swaying to and fro like that of a drunkard. I ran to her and threw my arms round her, but at that moment her knees seemed to give way and she fell to the ground. She writhed as one who is in terrible pain, and her limbs were dreadfully convulsed. At first I thought that she had not recognised me, but as I bent over her she suddenly shrieked out in a voice which I shall never forget, ‘Oh, my God! Helen! It was the band! The speckled band!’ There was something else which she would fain have said, and she stabbed with her finger into the air in the direction of the Doctor’s room, but a fresh convulsion seized her and choked her words. I rushed out, calling loudly for my stepfather, and I met him hastening from his room in his dressing-gown. When he reached my sister’s side she was unconscious, and though he poured brandy down her throat and sent for medical aid from the village, all efforts were in vain, for she slowly sank and died without having recovered her consciousness. Such was the dreadful end of my beloved sister.”\n“One moment,” said Holmes, “are you sure about this whistle and metallic sound? Could you swear to it?”\n“That was what the county coroner asked me at the inquiry. It is my strong impression that I heard it, and yet, among the crash of the gale and the creaking of an old house, I may possibly have been deceived.”\n“Was your sister dressed?”\n“No, she was in her night-dress. In her right hand was found the charred stump of a match, and in her left a match-box.”\n“Showing that she had struck a light and looked about her when the alarm took place. That is important. And what conclusions did the coroner come to?”\n“He investigated the case with great care, for Dr. Roylott’s conduct had long been notorious in the county, but he was unable to find any satisfactory cause of death. My evidence showed that the door had been fastened upon the inner side, and the windows were blocked by old-fashioned shutters with broad iron bars, which were secured every night. The walls were carefully sounded, and were shown to be quite solid all round, and the flooring was also thoroughly examined, with the same result. The chimney is wide, but is barred up by four large staples. It is certain, therefore, that my sister was quite alone when she met her end. Besides, there were no marks of any violence upon her.”\n“How about poison?”\n“The doctors examined her for it, but without success.”\n“What do you think that this unfortunate lady died of, then?”\n“It is my belief that she died of pure fear and nervous shock, though what it was that frightened her I cannot imagine.”\n“Were there gipsies in the plantation at the time?”\n“Yes, there are nearly always some there.”\n“Ah, and what did you gather from this allusion to a band—a speckled band?”\n“Sometimes I have thought that it was merely the wild talk of delirium, sometimes that it may have referred to some band of people, perhaps to these very gipsies in the plantation. I do not know whether the spotted handkerchiefs which so many of them wear over their heads might have suggested the strange adjective which she used.”\nHolmes shook his head like a man who is far from being satisfied.",
          "paraphrase_gemini-2.5-flash-preview-04-17": "Sherlock Holmes, who had been leaning back with his eyes closed and head resting on a cushion, slightly opened his eyelids and looked at his visitor. He asked her to be very specific with the details. She replied that it was easy to be precise because every event of that terrible time was deeply imprinted on her memory. She explained that the manor house, as she had mentioned, was very old, and only one section was currently occupied. The bedrooms in this part of the house were located on the ground floor, while the sitting rooms were in the main central part. Of these bedrooms, the first belonged to Dr. Roylott, the second to her sister, and the third to herself. There were no connecting doors between them, but all three opened onto the same corridor. She asked if this was clear, and Holmes confirmed it was perfectly clear. She continued, saying the windows of the three rooms faced the lawn. On that tragic night, Dr. Roylott had gone to his room early, though they knew he hadn't gone to bed because her sister was bothered by the smell of the strong Indian cigars he habitually smoked. Her sister, therefore, left her own room and came into hers, where she sat for a while discussing her upcoming marriage. Around eleven o'clock, she got up to leave but paused at the door and looked back. She asked, 'Tell me, Helen, have you ever heard anyone whistling in the middle of the night?' Helen said she never had. Her sister then asked if Helen might whistle in her sleep. Helen replied she certainly did not and asked why. Her sister explained that for the past few nights, around three in the morning, she had consistently heard a soft, clear whistle that woke her as she was a light sleeper. She wasn't sure where it came from—possibly the next room or perhaps the lawn—and just wanted to know if Helen had heard it. Helen said she hadn't and suggested it must be those troublesome gipsies in the plantation. Her sister agreed that was likely, but if it were on the lawn, she wondered why Helen hadn't heard it too. Helen responded that she slept more heavily. Her sister concluded it wasn't of great importance anyway. She smiled back at Helen, closed the door, and a few moments later, Helen heard her turn the key in the lock. Holmes interjected, asking if it was their usual practice to lock themselves in at night. The visitor confirmed they always did. When asked why, she reminded Holmes that the Doctor kept a cheetah and a baboon, and they felt unsafe unless their doors were locked. Holmes accepted this and asked her to continue her account. She said she couldn't sleep that night, feeling a vague sense of approaching misfortune. She recalled that she and her sister were twins and that the bond between closely related souls is subtle. It was a wild night, with the wind howling outside and rain splashing against the windows. Suddenly, above the noise of the storm, she heard the terrifying scream of a woman. She knew it was her sister's voice. She jumped out of bed, wrapped a shawl around herself, and rushed into the corridor. As she opened her door, she thought she heard a faint whistle, similar to the one her sister had described, and a few seconds later, a loud metallic clang, as if something heavy had fallen. As she ran down the passage, her sister's door was unlocked and slowly swinging open. She stared at it in horror, unsure what might emerge. By the light of the corridor lamp, she saw her sister appear in the doorway, her face pale with fear, her hands reaching out for support, her body swaying unsteadily like a drunkard's. Helen ran to her and put her arms around her, but at that moment, her sister's legs seemed to collapse, and she fell to the floor. She twisted in apparent agony, and her limbs convulsed dreadfully. At first, Helen thought her sister hadn't recognised her, but as Helen bent over her, she suddenly shrieked in a voice Helen would never forget, 'Oh, my God! Helen! It was the band! The speckled band!' There was something else she seemed desperate to say, and she stabbed her finger into the air towards the Doctor's room, but another convulsion seized her and she couldn't speak. Helen ran out, shouting for her stepfather, and met him hurrying from his room in his dressing-gown. When he reached her sister, she was unconscious. Despite his attempts to give her brandy and sending for a doctor from the village, all efforts failed; she slowly weakened and died without ever regaining consciousness. That, the visitor concluded, was the terrible end of her beloved sister. Holmes paused for a moment and asked if she was certain about hearing the whistle and the metallic sound, and if she could swear to it. She replied that the county coroner had asked her the same thing at the inquiry. She had a strong impression she heard them, but admitted that amid the noise of the storm and the creaking of the old house, she might have been mistaken. Holmes then asked if her sister was dressed. She said no, she was in her night-dress. She added that a charred piece of a match was found in her right hand and a match-box in her left. Holmes remarked that this indicated she had lit a match and looked around when the alarm occurred, which he found important. He then asked what conclusion the coroner reached. She stated that the coroner had investigated the case with great care, as Dr. Roylott's behaviour had been notorious in the area for some time, but he could not determine a satisfactory cause of death. Her testimony showed that the door had been fastened from the inside, and the windows were blocked by old-fashioned shutters with wide iron bars, which were secured every night. The walls were carefully checked and found to be completely solid, and the floor was also thoroughly examined with the same result. The chimney was wide but was blocked by four large staples. Therefore, it was certain that her sister was entirely alone when she died. Furthermore, there were no marks of violence on her body. Holmes inquired about poison. She said the doctors had examined her for it but found none. Holmes then asked what she thought had caused the unfortunate lady's death. She expressed her belief that she died purely from fear and nervous shock, although she could not imagine what had frightened her. Holmes asked if there were gipsies in the plantation at that time. She confirmed that there were almost always some there. Ah, Holmes said, and what did she understand by the allusion to a band—a speckled band? She replied that sometimes she thought it was merely the wild talk of delirium, and sometimes that it might have referred to some group of people, perhaps these very gipsies in the plantation. She wondered if the spotted handkerchiefs many of them wore over their heads might have suggested the strange adjective her sister used. Holmes shook his head, appearing far from satisfied.",
          "paraphrase_gpt-4.1-2025-04-14": "Sherlock Holmes was relaxing in his chair with his eyes closed and head resting on a cushion, but he partly opened his eyes and looked at his guest. \"Please be exact with your details,\" he requested. The visitor replied that it would not be difficult because all of the terrible events were etched in memory. The manor house was very old, with only one wing occupied; the bedrooms there were on the ground floor, while the sitting-rooms were in the central part. Dr. Roylott’s room was first, followed by the sister’s, then her own—all opening onto the same corridor, but not connected internally. Holmes confirmed understanding. Each room had windows opening onto the lawn. On the night in question, Dr. Roylott went to his room early, though it was evident he had not gone to sleep, as the sister complained of his strong Indian cigar smoke. She came to the narrator’s room to talk about her upcoming wedding and, before leaving at eleven, asked if Helen had ever heard whistling late at night. Helen said she hadn’t, nor could she imagine doing so in her sleep. The sister explained she’d heard a whistle at about three a.m. for several nights but couldn’t tell where it came from, possibly from the next room or the lawn, and wondered if Helen had noticed it; Helen suggested it was probably the local gypsies. The sister agreed but found it odd Helen hadn’t heard it as well; Helen reasoned she slept more deeply. Dismissing it, the sister closed the door and locked it.\n\nHolmes asked if locking themselves in was the usual practice; it was, because Dr. Roylott kept a cheetah and a baboon, so locking up made them feel safer. Moving on, Helen described how she couldn’t sleep that night, troubled by a vague sense of doom. She and her sister were twins, creating a close bond. Outside, the storm was raging. Suddenly, over the noise, came a woman’s terrified scream—her sister’s. Helen sprang up, threw on a shawl, and ran into the hall. Opening her door, she thought she heard a low whistle, then a metallic clang. She rushed down the corridor as her sister’s door swung open. Her sister appeared, terrified, staggering unsteadily, reaching out for help before collapsing. Helen tried to comfort her, but the sister fell in agony, writhing and convulsing. At first Helen thought her sister did not recognize her, but then her sister cried out about \"the speckled band,\" pointing toward Dr. Roylott’s room before another convulsion prevented her from saying more. Helen called for her stepfather, who came quickly. When he arrived, the sister was unconscious and, despite attempts to revive her, died without regaining consciousness. \n\nHolmes wanted clarification about the whistle and clang, and Helen replied that she was sure she heard them but admitted the storm might have caused confusion. Holmes asked about the sister’s attire (she was in her night dress), and noted that a burned match and matchbox were found in her hands, suggesting she’d tried to light the room when alarmed. The coroner could find no cause of death. The door was locked from the inside, windows shuttered and barred, walls and floor solid, and the chimney blocked by staples—so her sister must have been alone. There was no sign of violence. Holmes asked about poison, but none was found. Helen believed her sister died from fright or nervous shock, though she could not say what scared her. There were always gypsies nearby, and the mention of a \"speckled band\" might have referred to them, as many wore spotted bandanas, or it may have been delirium. Holmes looked dissatisfied with the explanation."

          "text_segment": "“These are very deep waters,” said he; “pray go on with your narrative.”\n“Two years have passed since then, and my life has been until lately lonelier than ever. A month ago, however, a dear friend, whom I have known for many years, has done me the honour to ask my hand in marriage. His name is Armitage—Percy Armitage—the second son of Mr. Armitage, of Crane Water, near Reading. My stepfather has offered no opposition to the match, and we are to be married in the course of the spring. Two days ago some repairs were started in the west wing of the building, and my bedroom wall has been pierced, so that I have had to move into the chamber in which my sister died, and to sleep in the very bed in which she slept. Imagine, then, my thrill of terror when last night, as I lay awake, thinking over her terrible fate, I suddenly heard in the silence of the night the low whistle which had been the herald of her own death. I sprang up and lit the lamp, but nothing was to be seen in the room. I was too shaken to go to bed again, however, so I dressed, and as soon as it was daylight I slipped down, got a dog-cart at the Crown Inn, which is opposite, and drove to Leatherhead, from whence I have come on this morning with the one object of seeing you and asking your advice.”\n“You have done wisely,” said my friend. “But have you told me all?”\n“Yes, all.”\n“Miss Roylott, you have not. You are screening your stepfather.”\n“Why, what do you mean?”\nFor answer Holmes pushed back the frill of black lace which fringed the hand that lay upon our visitor’s knee. Five little livid spots, the marks of four fingers and a thumb, were printed upon the white wrist.\n“You have been cruelly used,” said Holmes.\nThe lady coloured deeply and covered over her injured wrist. “He is a hard man,” she said, “and perhaps he hardly knows his own strength.”\nThere was a long silence, during which Holmes leaned his chin upon his hands and stared into the crackling fire.\n“This is a very deep business,” he said at last. “There are a thousand details which I should desire to know before I decide upon our course of action. Yet we have not a moment to lose. If we were to come to Stoke Moran to-day, would it be possible for us to see over these rooms without the knowledge of your stepfather?”\n“As it happens, he spoke of coming into town to-day upon some most important business. It is probable that he will be away all day, and that there would be nothing to disturb you. We have a housekeeper now, but she is old and foolish, and I could easily get her out of the way.”\n“Excellent. You are not averse to this trip, Watson?”\n“By no means.”\n“Then we shall both come. What are you going to do yourself?”\n“I have one or two things which I would wish to do now that I am in town. But I shall return by the twelve o’clock train, so as to be there in time for your coming.”\n“And you may expect us early in the afternoon. I have myself some small business matters to attend to. Will you not wait and breakfast?”\n“No, I must go. My heart is lightened already since I have confided my trouble to you. I shall look forward to seeing you again this afternoon.” She dropped her thick black veil over her face and glided from the room.",
          "paraphrase_gemini-2.5-flash-preview-04-17": "Holmes remarked, “This situation appears quite complex; please continue your account.”\n\n“Since that time,” she continued, “two years have elapsed, and my existence has felt even more solitary than before until recently. Nevertheless, about a month ago, a close friend I've known for a long time paid me the great compliment of proposing marriage. He is named Armitage—specifically, Percy Armitage—the second son of Mr. Armitage from Crane Water, situated near Reading. My stepfather hasn't objected to this union, and our wedding is planned for sometime this spring. Just two days ago, construction work commenced in the building's west wing, requiring a hole to be made in my bedroom wall. Because of this, I was forced to relocate to the room where my sister passed away and actually sleep in the very bed she used. Therefore, picture my intense fear when, last night, while lying awake and contemplating her dreadful end, I abruptly heard the quiet whistle in the stillness of the night—the same sound that signaled her own death. I quickly got up and illuminated the room with the lamp, but there was nothing visible. However, I was far too distressed to return to sleep, so I got dressed. As soon as dawn broke, I quietly left, secured a dog-cart from the Crown Inn across the street, and traveled to Leatherhead. From there, I journeyed here this morning with the sole purpose of consulting with you and seeking your counsel.”\n\n“You acted prudently,” commented Holmes. “Yet, have you disclosed everything?”\n\n“Yes, everything,” she replied.\n\n“Miss Roylott, you have not,” Holmes stated. “You are concealing information about your stepfather.”\n\n“Why, what are you implying?” she asked.\n\nIn response, Holmes gently pushed aside the black lace trim on the cuff of the hand resting on our visitor's lap. Five small, bruised-looking marks, clearly the impression of four fingers and a thumb, were visible on her pale wrist.\n\n“You have been treated cruelly,” Holmes observed.\n\nThe woman blushed intensely and concealed her marked wrist. “He is a harsh individual,” she stated, “and perhaps he isn't fully aware of his own physical power.”\n\nA lengthy silence followed, while Holmes rested his chin on his clasped hands and gazed into the lively flames of the fire.\n\n“This matter is exceedingly complex,” he finally said. “I would need to understand numerous specific points before determining how we should proceed. However, we have no time to spare. If we were to visit Stoke Moran today, would you be able to show us these rooms without your stepfather being aware?”\n\n“Coincidentally,” she replied, “he mentioned planning to come into the city today for some crucial business. It's likely he will be absent for the entire day, so there would be nothing to hinder you. We currently employ a housekeeper, but she is elderly and easily managed, and I could readily ensure she isn't present.”\n\n“Splendid,” Holmes responded. “You have no objection to this excursion, Watson?”\n\n“Certainly not,” I replied.\n\n“In that case, we will both accompany you,” Holmes confirmed. “What are your plans for yourself?”\n\n“Now that I am in the city, there are a few tasks I need to attend to,” she said. “But I will take the twelve o'clock train back to ensure I am there in time for your arrival.”\n\n“You can expect us relatively early in the afternoon,” Holmes said. “I also have some minor personal affairs to take care of. Won't you stay and join us for breakfast?”\n\n“No, I really must leave,” she insisted. “My spirits are already lifted now that I have shared my concerns with you. I eagerly anticipate seeing you again later this afternoon.” She then lowered the heavy black veil to cover her face and smoothly departed from the chamber.",

          "text_segment": "“And what do you think of it all, Watson?” asked Sherlock Holmes, leaning back in his chair.\n“It seems to me to be a most dark and sinister business.”\n“Dark enough and sinister enough.”\n“Yet if the lady is correct in saying that the flooring and walls are sound, and that the door, window, and chimney are impassable, then her sister must have been undoubtedly alone when she met her mysterious end.”\n“What becomes, then, of these nocturnal whistles, and what of the very peculiar words of the dying woman?”\n“I cannot think.”\n“When you combine the ideas of whistles at night, the presence of a band of gipsies who are on intimate terms with this old doctor, the fact that we have every reason to believe that the doctor has an interest in preventing his stepdaughter’s marriage, the dying allusion to a band, and, finally, the fact that Miss Helen Stoner heard a metallic clang, which might have been caused by one of those metal bars that secured the shutters falling back into its place, I think that there is good ground to think that the mystery may be cleared along those lines.”\n“But what, then, did the gipsies do?”\n“I cannot imagine.”\n“I see many objections to any such theory.”\n“And so do I. It is precisely for that reason that we are going to Stoke Moran this day. I want to see whether the objections are fatal, or if they may be explained away. But what in the name of the devil!”\nThe ejaculation had been drawn from my companion by the fact that our door had been suddenly dashed open, and that a huge man had framed himself in the aperture. His costume was a peculiar mixture of the professional and of the agricultural, having a black top-hat, a long frock-coat, and a pair of high gaiters, with a hunting-crop swinging in his hand. So tall was he that his hat actually brushed the cross bar of the doorway, and his breadth seemed to span it across from side to side. A large face, seared with a thousand wrinkles, burned yellow with the sun, and marked with every evil passion, was turned from one to the other of us, while his deep-set, bile-shot eyes, and his high, thin, fleshless nose, gave him somewhat the resemblance to a fierce old bird of prey.\n“Which of you is Holmes?” asked this apparition.\n“My name, sir; but you have the advantage of me,” said my companion quietly.\n“I am Dr. Grimesby Roylott, of Stoke Moran.”\n“Indeed, Doctor,” said Holmes blandly. “Pray take a seat.”\n“I will do nothing of the kind. My stepdaughter has been here. I have traced her. What has she been saying to you?”\n“It is a little cold for the time of the year,” said Holmes.\n“What has she been saying to you?” screamed the old man furiously.\n“But I have heard that the crocuses promise well,” continued my companion imperturbably.\n“Ha! You put me off, do you?” said our new visitor, taking a step forward and shaking his hunting-crop. “I know you, you scoundrel! I have heard of you before. You are Holmes, the meddler.”\nMy friend smiled.\n“Holmes, the busybody!”\nHis smile broadened.\n“Holmes, the Scotland Yard Jack-in-office!”\nHolmes chuckled heartily. “Your conversation is most entertaining,” said he. “When you go out close the door, for there is a decided draught.”\n“I will go when I have had my say. Don’t you dare to meddle with my affairs. I know that Miss Stoner has been here. I traced her! I am a dangerous man to fall foul of! See here.” He stepped swiftly forward, seized the poker, and bent it into a curve with his huge brown hands.\n“See that you keep yourself out of my grip,” he snarled, and hurling the twisted poker into the fireplace he strode out of the room.\n“He seems a very amiable person,” said Holmes, laughing. “I am not quite so bulky, but if he had remained I might have shown him that my grip was not much more feeble than his own.” As he spoke he picked up the steel poker and, with a sudden effort, straightened it out again.\n“Fancy his having the insolence to confound me with the official detective force! This incident gives zest to our investigation, however, and I only trust that our little friend will not suffer from her imprudence in allowing this brute to trace her. And now, Watson, we shall order breakfast, and afterwards I shall walk down to Doctors’ Commons, where I hope to get some data which may help us in this matter.”",
          "paraphrase_gemini-2.5-flash-preview-04-17": "Leaning back in his chair, Sherlock Holmes asked, \"And what are your thoughts on all of this, Watson?\" \"It strikes me as a very dark and sinister affair,\" I replied. \"Indeed, dark and sinister enough,\" he agreed. \"Yet, if the lady's description of the flooring, walls, door, window, and chimney being completely secure is accurate, then her sister must have been entirely by herself when she met her unexplained death.\" \"In that case, what significance do the nocturnal whistles hold, and what are we to make of the dying woman's highly unusual final words?\" Holmes queried. \"I'm at a loss,\" I confessed. \"When you consider the elements – whistles heard at night, the presence of a group of gipsies who appear to have a close association with this elderly doctor, our strong belief that the doctor has a vested interest in preventing his stepdaughter from marrying, the dying reference to a 'band,' and finally, Miss Helen Stoner's account of hearing a metallic sound, which could be one of the metal bars securing the shutters falling back into place – I believe there are valid reasons to think that the mystery might be clarified by pursuing these possibilities,\" Holmes suggested. \"But if so, what exactly did the gipsies do?\" I asked. \"That I cannot conceive,\" he admitted. \"I see numerous difficulties with any such theory,\" I stated. \"And I agree,\" Holmes replied. \"That is precisely why we are heading to Stoke Moran today. I intend to determine if these objections are insurmountable or if they can be adequately accounted for. But good heavens!\" This exclamation was prompted by the sudden violent opening of our door, revealing a massive man filling the doorway. His clothing was an odd blend of professional and rural attire, consisting of a black top-hat, a long frock-coat, and high gaiters, with a hunting-crop dangling in his hand. He was so tall that his hat actually brushed against the top of the door frame, and his width seemed to span the entire opening from side to side. His large face, etched with countless wrinkles, tanned a deep yellow by the sun, and marked by every negative emotion, turned its gaze between us. His deep-set, jaundiced eyes and high, thin, gaunt nose gave him something of the appearance of a fierce old bird of prey. \"Which one of you is Holmes?\" this imposing figure demanded. \"That is my name, sir, but you have the advantage of knowing mine while I do not know yours,\" my companion responded calmly. \"I am Dr. Grimesby Roylott, from Stoke Moran,\" he declared. \"Indeed, Doctor,\" Holmes said smoothly. \"Please, do take a seat.\" \"I shall do no such thing! My stepdaughter has been here. I tracked her. What has she been telling you?\" he bellowed. \"It's rather cold for this time of year,\" Holmes remarked. \"WHAT HAS SHE BEEN TELLING YOU?!\" the old man shrieked, furious. \"But I've heard the crocuses are looking very promising,\" my companion continued, utterly undisturbed. \"Aha! You think you can put me off, do you?\" our new visitor said, taking a step closer and shaking his hunting-crop menacingly. \"I know your game, you scoundrel! I've heard about you before. You are Holmes, the meddler.\" My friend merely smiled. \"Holmes, the busybody!\" His smile broadened. \"Holmes, that little clerk from Scotland Yard!\" Holmes let out a hearty chuckle. \"Your conversation is quite amusing,\" he said. \"When you leave, kindly close the door, as there is a noticeable draft.\" \"I will leave once I've said my piece. Don't you dare interfere in my affairs. I am aware that Miss Stoner was here. I followed her! I am a dangerous man to cross! Look here.\" He swiftly moved forward, grabbed the steel poker from the fireplace, and bent it into a curve with his huge brown hands. \"Make sure you stay out of my reach,\" he snarled, and after flinging the twisted poker into the fireplace, he strode out of the room. \"He seems like a most pleasant fellow,\" Holmes commented, laughing. \"I'm not quite as physically imposing, but had he stayed, I might have demonstrated that my grip is not significantly weaker than his own.\" As he spoke, he picked up the steel poker and, with a sudden, powerful effort, straightened it back into its original shape. \"Imagine his impertinence, confusing me with a mere official police detective! This incident certainly adds some excitement to our investigation, however. I only hope that our young friend won't suffer any ill effects from her lack of caution in allowing this brute to track her here. And now, Watson, we shall order breakfast, and afterward, I will walk down to Doctors' Commons, where I hope to gather some information that may be helpful in resolving this matter.\"",
          "paraphrase_gpt-4.1-2025-04-14": "Holmes leaned back in his chair and asked, “What do you make of all this, Watson?”\n\n“It strikes me as a very dark and suspicious affair,” I replied.\n\n“Indeed – it is both dark and suspicious.”\n\n“But if the woman is right about the rooms being secure – with sound flooring and walls, and an inescapable door, window, and chimney – then her sister must have been entirely alone when she mysteriously died.”\n\n“Then how do we explain those strange whistles heard at night, not to mention the dying woman’s peculiar words?”\n\n“I simply can’t imagine.”\n\n“If you put together the evidence – the whistles, the group of gipsies who are friendly with the old doctor, our reason to believe the doctor wanted to stop his stepdaughter’s marriage, the dying mention of a ‘band’, and finally, Helen Stoner hearing a metallic clang, possibly from the metal shutters dropping back in place – then there’s a strong possibility that the solution lies along these lines.”\n\n“But what role did the gipsies play in all this?”\n\n“I have no idea.”\n\n“There seem to be a lot of objections to that theory.”\n\n“I agree. That’s exactly why we’re going to Stoke Moran today – to check whether those objections are too serious or if we can resolve them. But—” Holmes’s exclamation was caused by the sudden, forceful opening of our door, where a huge man stood in the doorway. \n\nHis appearance combined both professional and country attire: a black top hat, long frock-coat, sturdy gaiters, and a hunting-crop in his hand. He was so tall his hat brushed the door frame, and so broad he nearly filled the entire space. His deeply wrinkled face was tanned and full of harsh expressions. His sunken, bloodshot eyes and sharp, thin nose gave him the look of a predatory bird.\n\n“Which of you is Holmes?” the stranger demanded.\n\n“That’s my name, but you have me at a disadvantage,” Holmes replied calmly.\n\n“I am Dr. Grimesby Roylott of Stoke Moran.”\n\n“Please, Doctor,” Holmes said pleasantly. “Take a seat.”\n\n“I most certainly will not. My stepdaughter was here – I have followed her. What did she say to you?”\n\n“It’s a bit chilly for the season,” Holmes remarked casually.\n\n“What did she tell you?” the man shouted furiously.\n\n“I understand the crocuses are doing well,” Holmes continued, completely unfazed.\n\n“You’re trying to avoid my question, are you?” the visitor replied, advancing with his hunting-crop. “I know all about you, you rascal! I’ve heard of you – Holmes the meddler.”\n\nHolmes smiled gently.\n\n“Holmes, the busybody!”\n\nHis smile grew broader.\n\n“Holmes, the Scotland Yard official!”\n\nHolmes laughed. “Your comments are quite amusing,” he said. “Please close the door on your way out – there’s a draft.”\n\n“I’ll leave when I’m finished. Don’t get involved in my affairs. I know Miss Stoner has visited you! I tracked her here! Oppose me at your peril. Look at this,” he said, grabbing the poker and bending it with his strong hands.\n\n“If you know what’s good for you, stay out of my way,” he snarled, tossing the twisted poker into the fireplace and storming out.\n\n“Charming fellow,” Holmes commented with a laugh. “I may not be as big, but if he’d stayed I could have shown him I’m not weak.” He then picked up the poker and, with a sudden motion, bent it back straight.\n\n“Imagine him confusing me with a police officer! Still, this encounter makes our case more exciting, though I hope our friend isn’t endangered because the brute tracked her here. Now, Watson, let’s have breakfast, and afterwards I’ll go to Doctors’ Commons to look up some information that might help.”"

          "text_segment": "It was nearly one o’clock when Sherlock Holmes returned from his excursion. He held in his hand a sheet of blue paper, scrawled over with notes and figures.\n“I have seen the will of the deceased wife,” said he. “To determine its exact meaning I have been obliged to work out the present prices of the investments with which it is concerned. The total income, which at the time of the wife’s death was little short of £ 1,100, is now, through the fall in agricultural prices, not more than £ 750. Each daughter can claim an income of £ 250, in case of marriage. It is evident, therefore, that if both girls had married, this beauty would have had a mere pittance, while even one of them would cripple him to a very serious extent. My morning’s work has not been wasted, since it has proved that he has the very strongest motives for standing in the way of anything of the sort. And now, Watson, this is too serious for dawdling, especially as the old man is aware that we are interesting ourselves in his affairs; so if you are ready, we shall call a cab and drive to Waterloo. I should be very much obliged if you would slip your revolver into your pocket. An Eley’s No. 2 is an excellent argument with gentlemen who can twist steel pokers into knots. That and a tooth-brush are, I think, all that we need.”\nAt Waterloo we were fortunate in catching a train for Leatherhead, where we hired a trap at the station inn and drove for four or five miles through the lovely Surrey lanes. It was a perfect day, with a bright sun and a few fleecy clouds in the heavens. The trees and wayside hedges were just throwing out their first green shoots, and the air was full of the pleasant smell of the moist earth. To me at least there was a strange contrast between the sweet promise of the spring and this sinister quest upon which we were engaged. My companion sat in the front of the trap, his arms folded, his hat pulled down over his eyes, and his chin sunk upon his breast, buried in the deepest thought. Suddenly, however, he started, tapped me on the shoulder, and pointed over the meadows.\n“Look there!” said he.\nA heavily timbered park stretched up in a gentle slope, thickening into a grove at the highest point. From amid the branches there jutted out the grey gables and high roof-tree of a very old mansion.\n“Stoke Moran?” said he.\n“Yes, sir, that be the house of Dr. Grimesby Roylott,” remarked the driver.\n“There is some building going on there,” said Holmes; “that is where we are going.”\n“There’s the village,” said the driver, pointing to a cluster of roofs some distance to the left; “but if you want to get to the house, you’ll find it shorter to get over this stile, and so by the footpath over the fields. There it is, where the lady is walking.”\n“And the lady, I fancy, is Miss Stoner,” observed Holmes, shading his eyes. “Yes, I think we had better do as you suggest.”\nWe got off, paid our fare, and the trap rattled back on its way to Leatherhead.\n“I thought it as well,” said Holmes as we climbed the stile, “that this fellow should think we had come here as architects, or on some definite business. It may stop his gossip. Good-afternoon, Miss Stoner. You see that we have been as good as our word.”\nOur client of the morning had hurried forward to meet us with a face which spoke her joy. “I have been waiting so eagerly for you,” she cried, shaking hands with us warmly. “All has turned out splendidly. Dr. Roylott has gone to town, and it is unlikely that he will be back before evening.”\n“We have had the pleasure of making the Doctor’s acquaintance,” said Holmes, and in a few words he sketched out what had occurred. Miss Stoner turned white to the lips as she listened.\n“Good heavens!” she cried, “he has followed me, then.”\n“So it appears.”\n“He is so cunning that I never know when I am safe from him. What will he say when he returns?”\n“He must guard himself, for he may find that there is someone more cunning than himself upon his track. You must lock yourself up from him to-night. If he is violent, we shall take you away to your aunt’s at Harrow. Now, we must make the best use of our time, so kindly take us at once to the rooms which we are to examine.”",
          "paraphrase_gemini-2.5-flash-preview-04-17": "Sherlock Holmes returned around 1 PM, carrying a blue paper covered in handwritten notes and calculations. He announced that he had reviewed the deceased wife's will. To understand its specific implications, he had to calculate the current value of the investments it referenced. He found that the total income, which was almost £1,100 when the wife died, had now fallen to no more than £750 due to declining agricultural prices. The will allowed each daughter to claim an income of £250 if they married. Holmes explained that if both daughters married, Dr. Roylott would be left with a very small amount of money, and even one marriage would cause him significant financial difficulty. He concluded that his morning's investigation had been productive, as it confirmed Roylott had a strong incentive to prevent any marriages. Holmes told Watson the situation was too serious for delay, especially since the old man knew they were involved. He suggested they immediately take a cab to Waterloo and asked Watson to bring his revolver, noting that an Eley's No. 2 was persuasive against violent individuals. He believed the revolver and a toothbrush were all they would need. At Waterloo, they caught a convenient train to Leatherhead. There, they hired a horse-drawn trap at the station inn and drove about four or five miles through pleasant Surrey country lanes. It was a beautiful spring day with bright sunshine and scattered clouds. The trees and hedges were starting to show new green leaves, and the air smelled richly of damp earth. Watson felt a stark contrast between the lovely spring scenery and the unsettling nature of their current mission. Holmes sat in the front of the trap, deep in thought, with his arms crossed and his hat pulled low. Suddenly, he stirred, tapped Watson's shoulder, and pointed towards the fields, telling him to look. A large, wooded park sloped gently upwards, becoming a dense grove at the top. The grey gables and high roof of a very old house could be seen emerging from the trees. Holmes asked if it was Stoke Moran, and the driver confirmed it was Dr. Grimesby Roylott's house. Holmes observed that construction work was underway and stated that was their destination. The driver pointed towards a cluster of roofs some distance away, indicating the village, but suggested a shorter route to the house by crossing a stile and following a footpath over the fields, pointing to a lady walking on the path. Holmes, shielding his eyes, suggested the lady was likely Miss Stoner and agreed they should follow the driver's suggestion. They disembarked, paid the driver, and the trap departed back towards Leatherhead. As they climbed the stile, Holmes mentioned that he thought it best for the driver to believe they were visiting as architects or for some specific business purpose, hoping it would prevent gossip. He then greeted Miss Stoner, saying they had kept their promise. Their client from that morning rushed forward, visibly relieved and happy. She expressed how eagerly she had been waiting and warmly shook their hands, informing them that everything had gone well, as Dr. Roylott had gone to London and was unlikely to return until the evening. Holmes replied that they had already met the Doctor and briefly described their encounter. Miss Stoner became visibly pale as she listened. She exclaimed in shock that he had followed her. Holmes confirmed this appeared to be the case. She voiced her fear of his cunning and uncertainty about what he would do upon his return. Holmes advised her to lock herself securely in her room that night and offered to take her to her aunt's in Harrow if Roylott became violent. He emphasized the need to use their time efficiently and asked her to immediately lead them to the rooms they needed to inspect.",
          "paraphrase_gpt-4.1-2025-04-14": "Sherlock Holmes returned at around one o’clock, carrying a blue sheet covered in scribbled notes and numbers. \"I've examined the will left by the late wife,\" he told Watson. \"I needed to calculate the current value of the investments involved to fully understand it. While the income was almost £1,100 at the time of her death, falling agricultural prices have reduced it to about £750 now. Each daughter stands to receive £250 a year upon marriage. Thus, if both girls had married, Dr. Roylott would be left with very little, and even one marriage would severely reduce his income. This clearly shows he had significant motives for preventing their marriages. My efforts this morning have not been in vain. Now, Watson, the situation is far too serious for delays, especially since the old man knows we are involved in his affairs. If you're ready, let’s get a cab to Waterloo. Please bring your revolver; an Eley’s No. 2 is useful for dealing with men who bend steel pokers! That, and a toothbrush, should suffice.\"\n\nThey managed to catch a train to Leatherhead from Waterloo, then hired a carriage and traveled several miles through the picturesque Surrey countryside. The day was beautiful, with sunshine, soft clouds, budding trees, and the fresh scent of earth, which felt oddly at odds with the dark case they were investigating. Holmes sat deep in thought, hat pulled low, until suddenly he nudged Watson and pointed to a timbered park that rose gently to a grove, with the roof and gray gables of an old mansion showing above the trees. \"Stoke Moran?\" he asked. The driver confirmed it was Dr. Grimesby Roylott’s house, noting ongoing construction there. He pointed out the village and suggested a shortcut across the fields toward a woman walking nearby, whom Holmes believed was Miss Stoner. They agreed to cross the stile and follow the path. \n\nAfter paying the driver, Holmes commented that it was wise to let people think they were visiting on regular business, maybe as architects, to avoid rumors. They greeted Miss Stoner, who welcomed them enthusiastically and announced that Dr. Roylott was away until evening. Holmes briefly explained what had happened earlier, causing Miss Stoner to grow pale, realizing Roylott had followed her. Holmes advised her to remain vigilant, warning that Roylott might meet someone even cleverer than he is. He suggested she lock herself in for safety and, if the doctor became violent, they would move her to her aunt’s. Then he asked her to immediately show them the rooms they needed to inspect."

          },
          "text_segment": "The building was of grey, lichen-blotched stone, with a high central portion and two curving wings, like the claws of a crab, thrown out on each side. In one of these wings the windows were broken and blocked with wooden boards, while the roof was partly caved in, a picture of ruin. The central portion was in little better repair, but the right-hand block was comparatively modern, and the blinds in the windows, with the blue smoke curling up from the chimneys, showed that this was where the family resided. Some scaffolding had been erected against the end wall, and the stone-work had been broken into, but there were no signs of any workmen at the moment of our visit. Holmes walked slowly up and down the ill-trimmed lawn and examined with deep attention the outsides of the windows.\n“This, I take it, belongs to the room in which you used to sleep, the centre one to your sister’s, and the one next to the main building to Dr. Roylott’s chamber?”\n“Exactly so. But I am now sleeping in the middle one.”\n“Pending the alterations, as I understand. By the way, there does not seem to be any very pressing need for repairs at that end wall.”\n“There were none. I believe that it was an excuse to move me from my room.”\n“Ah! that is suggestive. Now, on the other side of this narrow wing runs the corridor from which these three rooms open. There are windows in it, of course?”\n“Yes, but very small ones. Too narrow for anyone to pass through.”\n“As you both locked your doors at night, your rooms were unapproachable from that side. Now, would you have the kindness to go into your room and bar your shutters?”\nMiss Stoner did so, and Holmes, after a careful examination through the open window, endeavoured in every way to force the shutter open, but without success. There was no slit through which a knife could be passed to raise the bar. Then with his lens he tested the hinges, but they were of solid iron, built firmly into the massive masonry. “Hum!” said he, scratching his chin in some perplexity, “my theory certainly presents some difficulties. No one could pass these shutters if they were bolted. Well, we shall see if the inside throws any light upon the matter.”\nA small side door led into the whitewashed corridor from which the three bedrooms opened. Holmes refused to examine the third chamber, so we passed at once to the second, that in which Miss Stoner was now sleeping, and in which her sister had met with her fate. It was a homely little room, with a low ceiling and a gaping fireplace, after the fashion of old country-houses. A brown chest of drawers stood in one corner, a narrow white-counterpaned bed in another, and a dressing-table on the left-hand side of the window. These articles, with two small wicker-work chairs, made up all the furniture in the room save for a square of Wilton carpet in the centre. The boards round and the panelling of the walls were of brown, worm-eaten oak, so old and discoloured that it may have dated from the original building of the house. Holmes drew one of the chairs into a corner and sat silent, while his eyes travelled round and round and up and down, taking in every detail of the apartment.\n“Where does that bell communicate with?” he asked at last pointing to a thick bell-rope which hung down beside the bed, the tassel actually lying upon the pillow.\n“It goes to the housekeeper’s room.”\n“It looks newer than the other things?”\n“Yes, it was only put there a couple of years ago.”\n“Your sister asked for it, I suppose?”\n“No, I never heard of her using it. We used always to get what we wanted for ourselves.”\n“Indeed, it seemed unnecessary to put so nice a bell-pull there. You will excuse me for a few minutes while I satisfy myself as to this floor.” He threw himself down upon his face with his lens in his hand and crawled swiftly backward and forward, examining minutely the cracks between the boards. Then he did the same with the wood-work with which the chamber was panelled. Finally he walked over to the bed and spent some time in staring at it and in running his eye up and down the wall. Finally he took the bell-rope in his hand and gave it a brisk tug.\n“Why, it’s a dummy,” said he.\n“Won’t it ring?”\n“No, it is not even attached to a wire. This is very interesting. You can see now that it is fastened to a hook just above where the little opening for the ventilator is.”\n“How very absurd! I never noticed that before.”\n“Very strange!” muttered Holmes, pulling at the rope. “There are one or two very singular points about this room. For example, what a fool a builder must be to open a ventilator into another room, when, with the same trouble, he might have communicated with the outside air!”\n“That is also quite modern,” said the lady.\n“Done about the same time as the bell-rope?” remarked Holmes.\n“Yes, there were several little changes carried out about that time.”\n“They seem to have been of a most interesting character—dummy bell-ropes, and ventilators which do not ventilate. With your permission, Miss Stoner, we shall now carry our researches into the inner apartment.”\nDr. Grimesby Roylott’s chamber was larger than that of his step-daughter, but was as plainly furnished. A camp-bed, a small wooden shelf full of books, mostly of a technical character, an armchair beside the bed, a plain wooden chair against the wall, a round table, and a large iron safe were the principal things which met the eye. Holmes walked slowly round and examined each and all of them with the keenest interest.\n“What’s in here?” he asked, tapping the safe.\n“My stepfather’s business papers.”\n“Oh! you have seen inside, then?”\n“Only once, some years ago. I remember that it was full of papers.”\n“There isn’t a cat in it, for example?”\n“No. What a strange idea!”\n“Well, look at this!” He took up a small saucer of milk which stood on the top of it.\n“No; we don’t keep a cat. But there is a cheetah and a baboon.”\n“Ah, yes, of course! Well, a cheetah is just a big cat, and yet a saucer of milk does not go very far in satisfying its wants, I daresay. There is one point which I should wish to determine.” He squatted down in front of the wooden chair and examined the seat of it with the greatest attention.\n“Thank you. That is quite settled,” said he, rising and putting his lens in his pocket. “Hullo! Here is something interesting!”\nThe object which had caught his eye was a small dog lash hung on one corner of the bed. The lash, however, was curled upon itself and tied so as to make a loop of whipcord.\n“What do you make of that, Watson?”\n“It’s a common enough lash. But I don’t know why it should be tied.”\n“That is not quite so common, is it? Ah, me! it’s a wicked world, and when a clever man turns his brains to crime it is the worst of all. I think that I have seen enough now, Miss Stoner, and with your permission we shall walk out upon the lawn.”",
          "paraphrase_gemini-2.5-flash-preview-04-17": "The structure was crafted from grey stone, stained with lichen, featuring a tall central section flanked by two curved sections extending outward like crab claws. Windows in one of these wings were broken and covered with wood, and part of the roof had collapsed, presenting a scene of decay. The central part was only slightly better preserved, but the section on the right appeared relatively new, with blinds in the windows and blue smoke rising from the chimneys indicating that the family resided there. Scaffolding had been put up against the end wall, and the stone had been broken into, though no workmen were present during our visit. Holmes paced slowly across the poorly maintained lawn, observing the exterior of the windows with intense concentration. He surmised, \"I assume this room was yours, the middle one your sister's, and the one closest to the main building Dr. Roylott's study?\" Miss Stoner confirmed, \"Exactly. But I am currently sleeping in the middle one.\" Holmes understood, \"While the renovations are underway, I gather. Incidentally, there doesn't seem to be any urgent need for repairs on that end wall.\" \"There wasn't,\" she replied. \"I suspect it was an excuse to make me move from my room.\" \"Ah, that's insightful,\" Holmes mused. \"Now, a corridor runs along the other side of this narrow wing, off which these three rooms open. There are windows in it, naturally?\" \"Yes, but they are very small,\" she said. \"Too narrow for anyone to get through.\" Holmes concluded, \"As you both locked your doors at night, your rooms were inaccessible from that corridor. Now, would you be kind enough to go into your room and secure your window shutters?\" Miss Stoner complied, and Holmes, after closely inspecting through the open window, attempted to force the shutter open in various ways but failed. There was no gap wide enough to insert a knife to lift the bar. He then used his magnifying glass to examine the hinges, finding them made of solid iron, securely built into the thick stone wall. \"Hmm,\" he said, scratching his chin thoughtfully, \"my initial idea certainly faces some obstacles. No one could get past these shutters if they were bolted. Well, let's see if the inside offers any clarity.\" A small door on the side led into the whitewashed corridor from which the three bedrooms were accessed. Holmes chose not to examine the third room, proceeding directly to the second, the one Miss Stoner was now occupying and where her sister had tragically died. It was a simple, comfortable room with a low ceiling and a large, open fireplace typical of old country homes. A brown chest of drawers was in one corner, a narrow bed with a white coverlet in another, and a dressing table to the left of the window. These items, along with two small chairs made of wicker, constituted the room's entire furniture, except for a square of Wilton carpet in the center. The floorboards and wall panels were made of brown, woodworm-damaged oak, so old and faded it might have been original to the house's construction. Holmes moved one of the chairs to a corner and sat in silence, his gaze sweeping repeatedly around the room, absorbing every detail. \"Where does that bell connect to?\" he finally inquired, pointing to a thick bell-rope hanging next to the bed, its decorative end resting on the pillow. \"It goes to the housekeeper's room,\" she replied. \"It appears newer than the other furnishings?\" \"Yes, it was only installed about two years ago.\" \"Your sister requested it, I presume?\" \"No, I never knew her to use it. We always got what we needed ourselves.\" \"Indeed, installing such a prominent bell-pull here seems unnecessary. Please excuse me for a few minutes while I examine this floor.\" He lay flat on his stomach with his magnifying glass and quickly moved back and forth, meticulously inspecting the gaps between the floorboards. He then performed the same examination on the room's wooden paneling. Finally, he walked to the bed and spent some time gazing at it and scanning the wall up and down. He then took the bell-rope and gave it a sharp pull. \"Why, it's not real,\" he declared. \"It doesn't ring?\" she asked. \"No, it's not even connected to a wire,\" he said. \"This is quite intriguing. You can see now that it's attached to a hook just above the small opening for the ventilator.\" \"How utterly absurd! I never noticed that before.\" \"Very odd indeed!\" Holmes murmured, tugging the rope. \"There are a few very peculiar aspects to this room. For instance, what kind of builder would open a ventilator into another room when he could have connected it to the outside air with the same effort!\" \"That is also quite recent,\" the lady commented. \"Put in around the same time as the bell-rope?\" Holmes observed. \"Yes, several minor changes were made at that time.\" \"They seem to have been of a most unusual nature—fake bell-ropes and ventilators that don't actually ventilate. With your permission, Miss Stoner, we will now explore the room next door.\" Dr. Grimesby Roylott's room was larger than his stepdaughter's but similarly plainly furnished. A folding bed, a small wooden shelf filled mainly with technical books, an armchair next to the bed, a simple wooden chair against the wall, a round table, and a large iron safe were the main items visible. Holmes slowly circled the room, inspecting each object with intense curiosity. \"What's in here?\" he asked, tapping the safe. \"My stepfather's business documents,\" she answered. \"Oh, you've seen inside, then?\" \"Only once, years ago. I recall it was full of papers.\" \"There isn't a cat in it, for example?\" he asked strangely. \"No. What a peculiar question!\" \"Well, look at this!\" He picked up a small saucer of milk on top of the safe. \"No, we don't keep a cat,\" she said. \"But we do have a cheetah and a baboon.\" \"Ah, yes, of course!\" said Holmes. \"Well, a cheetah is essentially a large cat, though I doubt a saucer of milk goes far towards satisfying its needs. There's one more thing I'd like to verify.\" He crouched in front of the wooden chair and examined its seat with great care. \"Thank you, that confirms it,\" he said, standing up and putting his magnifying glass away. \"Hello! Here's something interesting!\" What caught his attention was a small dog whip hanging on a corner of the bed. The whip was coiled and tied into a loop of cord. \"What do you make of that, Watson?\" he asked. \"It's just a common whip,\" I replied. \"But I don't know why it would be tied.\" \"That part isn't so common, is it? Ah me! It's a grim world, and when a clever mind turns to crime, it's the worst of all. I believe I have seen enough for now, Miss Stoner. With your permission, we shall step out onto the lawn.\" ",
          "paraphrase_gpt-4.1-2025-04-14": "The house was built of gray stone marked with lichen, featuring a tall central section and two curved wings jutting out from either side, resembling crab claws. One of these wings showed signs of disrepair, with broken windows boarded up and the roof partially collapsed, presenting a scene of decay. The central section wasn’t in much better shape, but the right-hand wing looked more modern, with drawn blinds and smoke rising from its chimneys, suggesting that’s where the family now lived. Some scaffolding had been set up against one end wall, and the stonework had been disturbed, but there were no workmen to be seen. Holmes paced slowly up and down the poorly kept lawn, scrutinizing the exterior of the windows.\n\n\"That one used to be your bedroom, the middle one was your sister’s, and the one nearer the main building is Dr. Roylott’s?\" he asked.\n\n\"That’s right. But now I’m sleeping in the middle room.\"\n\n\"Because of the renovations, I gather. Still, there doesn’t seem to be any urgent need for work on that end wall.\"\n\n\"There isn’t. I think the repairs were just an excuse to move me.\"\n\n\"Interesting. Now, the corridor that serves these rooms runs along the opposite side of this narrow wing? There are windows in it?\"\n\n\"Yes, but they’re small—too narrow for anyone to get through.\"\n\n\"And you both locked your doors at night, so no one could enter from that side either. Would you mind going to your room and securing the shutters?\"\n\nMiss Stoner complied, and Holmes closely examined the window from the outside, attempting unsuccessfully to force the shutter open. He noted there was no opening even for a knife to slip through and found the iron hinges embedded securely in the stone. \"Hmm—this complicates my theory. With these shutters fastened, no one could come through them. We’ll see if the inside gives us more answers.\"\n\nA small side door led to a whitewashed corridor with the three bedrooms. Holmes skipped the third room and headed straight for the one where Miss Stoner now slept and where her sister died. The room was modest, with a low ceiling and a large fireplace, characteristic of old houses. There was a brown chest of drawers, a narrow bed with a white coverlet, a dressing-table to the left of the window, two wicker chairs, and a square Wilton carpet at the center. The floors and wall paneling were made of old, worm-eaten oak, so discolored they might date back to the house’s origin. Holmes pulled a chair into the corner and silently surveyed every aspect.\n\nHe pointed to a thick bell-rope hanging next to the bed, its tassel lying on the pillow. \"Where does that bell lead?\"\n\n\"To the housekeeper’s room.\"\n\n\"It appears newer than the other furnishings.\"\n\n\"Yes, it was installed a couple of years ago.\"\n\n\"Was it your sister’s request?\"\n\n\"No, I don’t recall her ever using it—we always managed for ourselves.\"\n\n\"Curious that such a nice bell-pull was added. Please excuse me while I check the floor.\" Holmes lay down with his lens, crawling back and forth examining the gaps in the boards and did the same for the old paneling. He then studied the bed and wall, before pulling the bell-rope sharply.\n\n\"This is a dummy,\" he observed.\n\n\"It doesn’t ring?\"\n\n\"No, it’s not even attached to a wire. Look, it’s fastened to a hook above the little air vent.\"\n\n\"How odd! I never noticed that before.\"\n\n\"Very strange indeed,\" Holmes muttered, pulling the rope again. \"This room has several odd features. For example, why would someone install a ventilator into another room instead of to the outside?\"\n\n\"That’s also quite new,\" the lady said.\n\n\"Was it done around the same time as the bell-rope?\"\n\n\"Yes, several small alterations were made then.\"\n\n\"They certainly are curious modifications—dummy bell-ropes and ventilators that don’t ventilate. Shall we examine the next room?\"\n\nDr. Roylott’s room was larger but simply furnished: a camp-bed, a small bookshelf with mostly technical books, an armchair by the bed, a wooden chair by the wall, a round table, and a large iron safe. Holmes circled the room, inspecting each item closely.\n\n\"What’s in this safe?\" he asked.\n\n\"My stepfather’s business papers.\"\n\n\"So you’ve seen inside it?\"\n\n\"Yes, years ago—it was just papers.\"\n\n\"There’s not a cat in here, for instance?\"\n\n\"No, that’s a strange idea.\"\n\n\"But look at this,\" Holmes said, picking up a small saucer of milk from the top of the safe.\n\n\"We don’t have a cat, but there is a cheetah and a baboon.\"\n\n\"Right, a cheetah is a sort of large cat, but that’s not much milk for one. In any case, there’s something else I’d like to check.\" He knelt by the wooden chair and thoroughly examined the seat.\n\n\"Thank you, that answers my question,\" he said, putting away his lens. \"Wait—what’s this?\"\n\nHe noticed a small dog whip draped over the corner of the bed. However, the lash was looped and tied with cord.\n\n\"What do you make of that, Watson?\"\n\n\"It's a common whip, but I don’t see why it’s tied.\"\n\n\"That's not so usual. It’s a wicked world—when clever people turn to crime, it's the worst possible scenario. I believe I’ve seen enough for now, Miss Stoner, and if you will, let us return to the lawn.\""

We had walked several times up and down the lawn, neither Miss Stoner nor myself liking to break in upon his thoughts before he roused himself from his reverie.\n“It is very essential, Miss Stoner,” said he, “that you should absolutely follow my advice in every respect.”\n“I shall most certainly do so.”\n“The matter is too serious for any hesitation. Your life may depend upon your compliance.”\n“I assure you that I am in your hands.”\n“In the first place, both my friend and I must spend the night in your room.”\nBoth Miss Stoner and I gazed at him in astonishment.\n“Yes, it must be so. Let me explain. I believe that that is the village inn over there?”\n“Yes, that is the Crown.”\n“Very good. Your windows would be visible from there?”\n“Certainly.”\n“You must confine yourself to your room, on pretence of a headache, when your stepfather comes back. Then when you hear him retire for the night, you must open the shutters of your window, undo the hasp, put your lamp there as a signal to us, and then withdraw quietly with everything which you are likely to want into the room which you used to occupy. I have no doubt that, in spite of the repairs, you could manage there for one night.”\n“Oh, yes, easily.”\n“The rest you will leave in our hands.”\n“But what will you do?”\n“We shall spend the night in your room, and we shall investigate the cause of this noise which has disturbed you.”\n“I believe, Mr. Holmes, that you have already made up your mind,” said Miss Stoner, laying her hand upon my companion’s sleeve.\n“Perhaps I have.”\n“Then, for pity’s sake, tell me what was the cause of my sister’s death.”\n“I should prefer to have clearer proofs before I speak.”\n“You can at least tell me whether my own thought is correct, and if she died from some sudden fright.”\n“No, I do not think so. I think that there was probably some more tangible cause. And now, Miss Stoner, we must leave you for if Dr. Roylott returned and saw us our journey would be in vain. Good-bye, and be brave, for if you will do what I have told you, you may rest assured that we shall soon drive away the dangers that threaten you.”\nSherlock Holmes and I had no difficulty in engaging a bedroom and sitting-room at the Crown Inn. They were on the upper floor, and from our window we could command a view of the avenue gate, and of the inhabited wing of Stoke Moran Manor House. At dusk we saw Dr. Grimesby Roylott drive past, his huge form looming up beside the little figure of the lad who drove him. The boy had some slight difficulty in undoing the heavy iron gates, and we heard the hoarse roar of the Doctor’s voice and saw the fury with which he shook his clinched fists at him. The trap drove on, and a few minutes later we saw a sudden light spring up among the trees as the lamp was lit in one of the sitting-rooms.\n“Do you know, Watson,” said Holmes as we sat together in the gathering darkness, “I have really some scruples as to taking you to-night. There is a distinct element of danger.”\n“Can I be of assistance?”\n“Your presence might be invaluable.”\n“Then I shall certainly come.”\n“It is very kind of you.”\n“You speak of danger. You have evidently seen more in these rooms than was visible to me.”\n“No, but I fancy that I may have deduced a little more. I imagine that you saw all that I did.”\n“I saw nothing remarkable save the bell-rope, and what purpose that could answer I confess is more than I can imagine.”\n“You saw the ventilator, too?”\n“Yes, but I do not think that it is such a very unusual thing to have a small opening between two rooms. It was so small that a rat could hardly pass through.”\n“I knew that we should find a ventilator before ever we came to Stoke Moran.”\n“My dear Holmes!”\n“Oh, yes, I did. You remember in her statement she said that her sister could smell Dr. Roylott’s cigar. Now, of course that suggested at once that there must be a communication between the two rooms. It could only be a small one, or it would have been remarked upon at the coroner’s inquiry. I deduced a ventilator.”\n“But what harm can there be in that?”\n“Well, there is at least a curious coincidence of dates. A ventilator is made, a cord is hung, and a lady who sleeps in the bed dies. Does not that strike you?”\n“I cannot as yet see any connection.”\n“Did you observe anything very peculiar about that bed?”\n“No.”\n“It was clamped to the floor. Did you ever see a bed fastened like that before?”\n“I cannot say that I have.”\n“The lady could not move her bed. It must always be in the same relative position to the ventilator and to the rope—or so we may call it, since it was clearly never meant for a bell-pull.”\n“Holmes,” I cried, “I seem to see dimly what you are hinting at. We are only just in time to prevent some subtle and horrible crime.”\n“Subtle enough and horrible enough. When a doctor does go wrong he is the first of criminals. He has nerve and he has knowledge. Palmer and Pritchard were among the heads of their profession. This man strikes even deeper, but I think, Watson, that we shall be able to strike deeper still. But we shall have horrors enough before the night is over; for goodness’ sake let us have a quiet pipe and turn our minds for a few hours to something more cheerful.”",

That’s no problem.”\n\n“Leave everything else to us.”\n\n“But what will you do?”\n\n“We will spend the night in your room and try to discover what is causing the noise that has been bothering you.”\n\n“Mr. Holmes, I believe you have already formed a theory,” said Miss Stoner, touching Holmes’s sleeve.\n\n“Perhaps I have,” he replied.\n\n“Then, please, tell me what killed my sister.”\n\n“I would rather wait for stronger proof before I say anything.”\n\n“Can you at least tell me if my suspicion is correct, and if she died from a sudden fright?”\n\n“No, I don’t think so. I believe there was a more concrete reason. For now, Miss Stoner, we must leave, because if Dr. Roylott comes back and finds us here, all will be lost. Goodbye, and have courage; if you do as I have instructed, you can trust we will soon remove the danger threatening you.”\n\nHolmes and I had no trouble renting a bedroom and a sitting-room at the Crown Inn. Our rooms were upstairs with a view of the avenue gate and the inhabited part of Stoke Moran Manor House. At dusk, we watched as Dr. Grimesby Roylott drove past, his large figure beside the small boy who was driving. The boy struggled to open the heavy iron gates, and we heard Dr. Roylott shouting hoarsely and saw him shaking his fist furiously. The carriage moved on, and moments later a light appeared among the trees as a lamp was lit in one of the sitting-rooms.\n\n\"Watson,\" said Holmes, as we sat together in the growing darkness, \"I do have some concerns about bringing you along tonight. There is an element of real danger.\"\n\n\"Can I help in any way?\" I asked.\n\n\"Your presence could be very valuable.\"\n\n\"Then I will definitely come.\"\n\n\"That is very kind of you.\"\n\n\"You mention danger. Clearly, you have noticed more than I did in these rooms.\"\n\n\"Not really, but perhaps I’ve drawn a few more conclusions. I would guess you saw everything I did.\"\n\n\"I noticed nothing unusual, except for the bell-rope, and I cannot imagine what its purpose is.\"\n\n\"You saw the ventilator as well?\"\n\n\"Yes, but it doesn’t seem strange to have a small opening between two rooms. It was so small that even a rat could hardly get through.\"\n\n\"I expected there would be a ventilator before we even arrived at Stoke Moran.\"\n\n\"My dear Holmes!\"\n\n\"Yes, indeed. Do you remember how, in her statement, Miss Stoner said her sister could smell Dr. Roylott’s cigar? That suggested there was some opening connecting the two rooms. It had to be small, or surely the coroner would have noticed it. I deduced there would be a ventilator.\"\n\n\"But what harm could there be in that?\"\n\n\"Well, think about this odd coincidence: a ventilator is put in, a rope is hung from the ceiling, and a woman sleeping in that bed dies. Doesn’t that strike you as suspicious?\"\n\n\"I can't see the connection yet.\"\n\n\"Did you notice anything unusual about the bed?\"\n\n\"No.\"\n\n\"It was fixed to the floor. Have you ever seen a bed fastened that way before?\"\n\n\"I can’t say that I have.\"\n\n\"So, the lady couldn’t move her bed. It had to remain in the same position beneath the ventilator and the cord — which, clearly, was never meant for a bell-pull.\"\n\n\"Holmes,\" I exclaimed, \"I think I have a vague idea of what you're getting at. We are just in time to prevent some cunning and dreadful crime.\"\n\n\"Extremely cunning and quite dreadful. When a doctor becomes a criminal, he can be the most dangerous. He has the skill and the daring. Palmer and Pritchard were among the most infamous; this man is just as bad, but I believe we can outwit him. Still, I suspect this night will bring enough horrors; for now, let’s smoke a pipe and focus on something more pleasant for a few hours.\""

          "text_segment": "About nine o’clock the light among the trees was extinguished, and all was dark in the direction of the Manor House. Two hours passed slowly away, and then, suddenly, just at the stroke of eleven, a single bright light shone out right in front of us.\n“That is our signal,” said Holmes, springing to his feet; “it comes from the middle window.”\nAs we passed out he exchanged a few words with the landlord, explaining that we were going on a late visit to an acquaintance, and that it was possible that we might spend the night there. A moment later we were out on the dark road, a chill wind blowing in our faces, and one yellow light twinkling in front of us through the gloom to guide us on our sombre errand.\nThere was little difficulty in entering the grounds, for unrepaired breaches gaped in the old park wall. Making our way among the trees, we reached the lawn, crossed it, and were about to enter through the window when out from a clump of laurel bushes there darted what seemed to be a hideous and distorted child, who threw itself upon the grass with writhing limbs and then ran swiftly across the lawn into the darkness.\n“My God!” I whispered; “did you see it?”\nHolmes was for the moment as startled as I. His hand closed like a vice upon my wrist in his agitation. Then he broke into a low laugh and put his lips to my ear.\n“It is a nice household,” he murmured. “That is the baboon.”\nI had forgotten the strange pets which the Doctor affected. There was a cheetah, too; perhaps we might find it upon our shoulders at any moment. I confess that I felt easier in my mind when, after following Holmes’ example and slipping off my shoes, I found myself inside the bedroom. My companion noiselessly closed the shutters, moved the lamp onto the table, and cast his eyes round the room. All was as we had seen it in the daytime. Then creeping up to me and making a trumpet of his hand, he whispered into my ear again so gently that it was all that I could do to distinguish the words:\n“The least sound would be fatal to our plans.”\nI nodded to show that I had heard.\n“We must sit without light. He would see it through the ventilator.”\nI nodded again.\n“Do not go asleep; your very life may depend upon it. Have your pistol ready in case we should need it. I will sit on the side of the bed, and you in that chair.”\nI took out my revolver and laid it on the corner of the table.\nHolmes had brought up a long thin cane, and this he placed upon the bed beside him. By it he laid the box of matches and the stump of a candle. Then he turned down the lamp, and we were left in darkness.\nHow shall I ever forget that dreadful vigil? I could not hear a sound, not even the drawing of a breath, and yet I knew that my companion sat open-eyed, within a few feet of me, in the same state of nervous tension in which I was myself. The shutters cut off the least ray of light, and we waited in absolute darkness.\nFrom outside came the occasional cry of a night-bird, and once at our very window a long drawn catlike whine, which told us that the cheetah was indeed at liberty. Far away we could hear the deep tones of the parish clock, which boomed out every quarter of an hour. How long they seemed, those quarters! Twelve struck, and one and two and three, and still we sat waiting silently for whatever might befall.\nSuddenly there was the momentary gleam of a light up in the direction of the ventilator, which vanished immediately, but was succeeded by a strong smell of burning oil and heated metal. Someone in the next room had lit a dark-lantern. I heard a gentle sound of movement, and then all was silent once more, though the smell grew stronger. For half an hour I sat with straining ears. Then suddenly another sound became audible—a very gentle, soothing sound, like that of a small jet of steam escaping continually from a kettle. The instant that we heard it, Holmes sprang from the bed, struck a match, and lashed furiously with his cane at the bell-pull.\n“You see it, Watson?” he yelled. “You see it?”\nBut I saw nothing. At the moment when Holmes struck the light I heard a low, clear whistle, but the sudden glare flashing into my weary eyes made it impossible for me to tell what it was at which my friend lashed so savagely. I could, however, see that his face was deadly pale and filled with horror and loathing. He had ceased to strike and was gazing up at the ventilator when suddenly there broke from the silence of the night the most horrible cry to which I have ever listened. It swelled up louder and louder, a hoarse yell of pain and fear and anger all mingled in the one dreadful shriek. They say that away down in the village, and even in the distant parsonage, that cry raised the sleepers from their beds. It struck cold to our hearts, and I stood gazing at Holmes, and he at me, until the last echoes of it had died away into the silence from which it rose.\n“What can it mean?” I gasped.\n“It means that it is all over,” Holmes answered. “And perhaps, after all, it is for the best. Take your pistol, and we will enter Dr. Roylott’s room.”\nWith a grave face he lit the lamp and led the way down the corridor. Twice he struck at the chamber door without any reply from within. Then he turned the handle and entered, I at his heels, with the cocked pistol in my hand.\nIt was a singular sight which met our eyes. On the table stood a dark-lantern with the shutter half open, throwing a brilliant beam of light upon the iron safe, the door of which was ajar. Beside this table, on the wooden chair, sat Dr. Grimesby Roylott clad in a long grey dressing-gown, his bare ankles protruding beneath, and his feet thrust into red heelless Turkish slippers. Across his lap lay the short stock with the long lash which we had noticed during the day. His chin was cocked upward and his eyes were fixed in a dreadful, rigid stare at the corner of the ceiling. Round his brow he had a peculiar yellow band, with brownish speckles, which seemed to be bound tightly round his head. As we entered he made neither sound nor motion.\n“The band! the speckled band!” whispered Holmes.\nI took a step forward. In an instant his strange headgear began to move, and there reared itself from among his hair the squat diamond-shaped head and puffed neck of a loathsome serpent.\n“It is a swamp adder!” cried Holmes; “the deadliest snake in India. He has died within ten seconds of being bitten. Violence does, in truth, recoil upon the violent, and the schemer falls into the pit which he digs for another. Let us thrust this creature back into its den, and we can then remove Miss Stoner to some place of shelter and let the county police know what has happened.”\nAs he spoke he drew the dog-whip swiftly from the dead man’s lap, and throwing the noose round the reptile’s neck he drew it from its horrid perch and, carrying it at arm’s length, threw it into the iron safe, which he closed upon it.\nSuch are the true facts of the death of Dr. Grimesby Roylott, of Stoke Moran. It is not necessary that I should prolong a narrative which has already run to too great a length by telling how we broke the sad news to the terrified girl, how we conveyed her by the morning train to the care of her good aunt at Harrow, of how the slow process of official inquiry came to the conclusion that the doctor met his fate while indiscreetly playing with a dangerous pet. The little which I had yet to learn of the case was told me by Sherlock Holmes as we travelled back next day.\n“I had,” said he, “come to an entirely erroneous conclusion which shows, my dear Watson, how dangerous it always is to reason from insufficient data. The presence of the gipsies, and the use of the word ‘band,’ which was used by the poor girl, no doubt, to explain the appearance which she had caught a hurried glimpse of by the light of her match, were sufficient to put me upon an entirely wrong scent. I can only claim the merit that I instantly reconsidered my position when, however, it became clear to me that whatever danger threatened an occupant of the room could not come either from the window or the door. My attention was speedily drawn, as I have already remarked to you, to this ventilator, and to the bell-rope which hung down to the bed. The discovery that this was a dummy, and that the bed was clamped to the floor, instantly gave rise to the suspicion that the rope was there as a bridge for something passing through the hole and coming to the bed. The idea of a snake instantly occurred to me, and when I coupled it with my knowledge that the doctor was furnished with a supply of creatures from India, I felt that I was probably on the right track. The idea of using a form of poison which could not possibly be discovered by any chemical test was just such a one as would occur to a clever and ruthless man who had had an Eastern training. The rapidity with which such a poison would take effect would also, from his point of view, be an advantage. It would be a sharp-eyed coroner, indeed, who could distinguish the two little dark punctures which would show where the poison fangs had done their work. Then I thought of the whistle. Of course he must recall the snake before the morning light revealed it to the victim. He had trained it, probably by the use of the milk which we saw, to return to him when summoned. He would put it through this ventilator at the hour that he thought best, with the certainty that it would crawl down the rope and land on the bed. It might or might not bite the occupant, perhaps she might escape every night for a week, but sooner or later she must fall a victim.\n“I had come to these conclusions before ever I had entered his room. An inspection of his chair showed me that he had been in the habit of standing on it, which of course would be necessary in order that he should reach the ventilator. The sight of the safe, the saucer of milk, and the loop of whipcord were enough to finally dispel any doubts which may have remained. The metallic clang heard by Miss Stoner was obviously caused by her stepfather hastily closing the door of his safe upon its terrible occupant. Having once made up my mind, you know the steps which I took in order to put the matter to the proof. I heard the creature hiss as I have no doubt that you did also, and I instantly lit the light and attacked it.”\n“With the result of driving it through the ventilator.”\n“And also with the result of causing it to turn upon its master at the other side. Some of the blows of my cane came home and roused its snakish temper, so that it flew upon the first person it saw. In this way I am no doubt indirectly responsible for Dr. Grimesby Roylott’s death, and I cannot say that it is likely to weigh very heavily upon my conscience.”",
          "paraphrase_gemini-2.5-flash-preview-04-17": "Around nine in the evening, the light visible through the trees disappeared, leaving the area towards the Manor House in darkness. Two hours passed slowly. Then, abruptly, precisely at eleven o'clock, a single bright light became visible directly in front of us. \"That's our signal,\" Holmes exclaimed, jumping to his feet. \"It's coming from the middle window.\" As we departed, he quickly told the innkeeper that we were visiting an acquaintance late at night and might stay over. Moments later, we were on the dark road, a cold wind biting at our faces, with only that one yellow light flickering ahead in the gloom to guide us on our grim mission. Gaining access to the grounds wasn't difficult, as old sections of the park wall had unrepaired gaps. Navigating through the trees, we reached the grassy area, crossed it, and were about to enter through the window when something that looked like a deformed and terrifying child darted out from a cluster of laurel bushes. It threw itself onto the ground, contorting its limbs, before running swiftly across the lawn and vanishing into the darkness. \"My God!\" I whispered, \"Did you see that?\" Holmes was as shocked as I was for a moment. In his agitation, his hand gripped my wrist tightly. Then he let out a quiet laugh and spoke close to my ear. \"This is quite a household,\" he murmured. \"That was the baboon.\" I had forgotten the Doctor's unusual pets. He also had a cheetah; perhaps it could appear on our shoulders at any moment. I admit I felt more at ease once I had followed Holmes's lead, removed my shoes, and was safely inside the bedroom. My companion quietly shut the window coverings, moved the lamp to the table, and surveyed the room. Everything was just as we had observed it during the day. Then, crouching beside me, he cupped his hand like a megaphone and whispered into my ear again, so softly I could barely make out the words: \"The slightest noise would ruin our plans.\" I nodded to indicate I understood. \"We must remain without light. He would spot it through the vent.\" I nodded again. \"Stay awake; your life could depend on it. Keep your pistol ready in case we need it. I'll sit on the edge of the bed, and you take that chair.\" I took out my revolver and placed it on the corner of the table. Holmes had brought a long, thin walking stick, which he laid on the bed next to him. Beside it, he put the box of matches and a candle stub. He then turned down the lamp, plunging us into darkness. I will never forget that terrifying wait. I couldn't hear anything, not even a breath being taken, yet I knew my companion was sitting a few feet away, wide awake and just as tense as I was. The shutters blocked out every trace of light, and we waited in complete blackness. From outside, we occasionally heard the call of a night bird, and once right by our window, a drawn-out, cat-like whine, confirming that the cheetah was indeed roaming free. In the distance, we could hear the deep chimes of the local church clock, sounding every fifteen minutes. How long those quarter-hours felt! Midnight struck, then one, two, and three, and still we sat in silence, waiting for whatever was to come. Suddenly, there was a brief flash of light from the direction of the ventilator, which vanished instantly, but was followed by a strong smell of burning oil and hot metal. Someone in the adjacent room had lit a dark lantern. I heard a faint stir, then silence returned, although the smell intensified. For half an hour, I listened intently. Then, another sound became audible—a very soft, steady noise, like a small stream of steam escaping from a kettle. The moment we heard it, Holmes leaped from the bed, struck a match, and began furiously lashing at the bell-pull with his cane. \"Do you see it, Watson?\" he yelled. \"Do you see it?\" But I saw nothing. As Holmes struck the light, I heard a low, clear whistle, but the sudden intense glare in my tired eyes made it impossible for me to discern what my friend was striking so fiercely. However, I could see that his face was deathly pale, filled with horror and disgust. He stopped striking and was staring up at the ventilator when suddenly, shattering the night's quiet, came the most dreadful scream I have ever heard. It grew louder and louder, a hoarse shriek of pain, fear, and anger all mixed together. They say that down in the village, and even at the distant vicarage, that cry woke people from their sleep. It chilled us to the bone, and I stared at Holmes, and he at me, until its last echoes faded back into the silence from which it arose. \"What could it mean?\" I gasped. \"It means it's over,\" Holmes replied. \"And perhaps, in the end, it's for the best. Get your pistol, and we will go into Dr. Roylott's room.\" With a serious expression, he lit the lamp and led the way down the hallway. He knocked twice on the bedroom door with no response from inside. Then he turned the doorknob and went in, with me close behind, my cocked pistol ready. What we saw was extraordinary. On the table sat a dark lantern with its shutter partly open, casting a bright beam onto the iron safe, whose door was slightly ajar. Next to this table, on the wooden chair, sat Dr. Grimesby Roylott, wearing a long grey dressing-gown, his bare ankles showing, and his feet clad in red heelless Turkish slippers. Lying across his lap was the short handle with the long lash we had observed earlier in the day. His chin was tilted upwards, and his eyes were fixed in a terrible, rigid stare at the ceiling corner. Around his forehead was a distinctive yellow band with brownish spots, which seemed tightly bound. As we entered, he neither made a sound nor moved. \"The band! the speckled band!\" Holmes whispered. I moved forward. In an instant, his strange head covering began to stir, and from among his hair emerged the flat, diamond-shaped head and swollen neck of a repulsive snake. \"It's a swamp adder!\" Holmes cried. \"The deadliest snake in India. He died within ten seconds of the bite. Violence truly does come back upon the violent, and the plotter falls into the trap he sets for someone else. Let's put this creature back in its cage, and then we can take Miss Stoner to a safe place and inform the local police about what happened.\" As he spoke, he swiftly took the dog-whip from the dead man's lap, looped the noose around the reptile's neck, pulled it away from its horrible resting place, and carrying it at arm's length, threw it into the iron safe, which he then shut. These are the true facts surrounding the death of Dr. Grimesby Roylott of Stoke Moran. I don't need to extend this account, which is already quite lengthy, by describing how we delivered the sad news to the terrified young woman, how we took her by morning train to her kind aunt's care in Harrow, or how the slow official investigation concluded that the doctor met his end while carelessly handling a dangerous pet. The final details I learned about the case were shared by Sherlock Holmes as we returned the following day. \"I had,\" he said, \"reached a completely incorrect conclusion, which demonstrates, my dear Watson, how risky it is to base reasoning on insufficient information. The presence of the travellers, and the use of the word 'band,' which the poor girl undoubtedly used to describe the appearance she briefly glimpsed in the light of her match, were enough to send me down entirely the wrong path. My only credit is that I immediately reconsidered my position when it became evident that any threat to someone in the room could not come from either the window or the door. My attention was quickly drawn, as I mentioned earlier, to this ventilator, and to the bell-rope hanging down to the bed. Discovering that this was a fake and that the bed was fixed to the floor instantly led to the suspicion that the rope served as a passage for something coming through the opening and reaching the bed. The idea of a snake immediately came to mind, and when I combined it with my knowledge that the doctor kept a collection of creatures from India, I felt I was probably on the right track. The notion of using a poison that chemical tests couldn't detect was exactly the kind of plan a clever and cruel man with an Eastern background might conceive. The speed at which such a poison would work was also, from his perspective, an advantage. It would indeed take a sharp-eyed coroner to spot the two small, dark puncture marks indicating where the poisonous fangs had struck. Then I considered the whistle. Of course, he would need to call the snake back before daylight revealed it to the victim. He had likely trained it, perhaps using the milk we saw, to return when summoned. He would send it through this ventilator at the time he judged best, certain it would slither down the rope and land on the bed. It might or might not bite the occupant; perhaps she could escape every night for a week, but eventually, she was bound to become a victim. \"I had reached these conclusions even before entering his room. Examining his chair showed me that he was in the habit of standing on it, which would naturally be necessary for him to reach the ventilator. The sight of the safe, the saucer of milk, and the loop of whipcord were sufficient to finally eliminate any remaining doubts. The metallic noise Miss Stoner heard was clearly caused by her stepfather quickly closing the door of his safe upon its terrible occupant. Once I had made up my mind, you know the steps I took to confirm my theory. I heard the creature hiss, as I'm sure you did too, and I instantly lit the light and attacked it.\" \"Resulting in driving it back through the ventilator.\" \"And also resulting in causing it to turn on its master on the other side. Some of the blows from my cane landed and provoked its snake-like temper, so it struck out at the first person it saw. In this way, I am undoubtedly indirectly responsible for Dr. Grimesby Roylott's death, and I must say I don't anticipate it weighing heavily on my conscience.\"",
          "paraphrase_gpt-4.1-2025-04-14": "Around nine o'clock, the light in the trees near the Manor House went out, leaving everything in darkness in that direction. Two slow hours slipped by until, at the stroke of eleven, a single bright light suddenly appeared straight ahead of us.\n\n\"That's our sign,\" Holmes said, jumping up. \"It comes from the middle window.\"\n\nAs we left, Holmes told the landlord we were heading out for a late-night visit with a friend, and that we might not return until morning. Soon, we stepped out onto the dark road, where a cold wind blew and one yellow light ahead pierced the gloom, leading us on our grim mission.\n\nGetting into the grounds was easy; there were gaps in the dilapidated wall. Dodging among the trees, we reached the lawn, crossed it, and were just about to climb through the window when, suddenly, a terrifying, twisted-looking child seemed to burst out from the laurel bushes, flailing on the grass before dashing away into the darkness.\n\n\"Good heavens!\" I whispered. \"Did you see that?\"\n\nHolmes, shocked too, gripped my wrist tightly in his alarm. Then he gave a quiet laugh and murmured to me:\n\n\"What a house. That's the baboon.\"\n\nI remembered then the odd animals the Doctor kept. There was also a cheetah—I wondered if it might pounce on us at any moment. I was relieved, after copying Holmes and silently removing my shoes, to follow him into the bedroom. Holmes closed the shutters, set the lamp on the table, and cautiously looked around the room. Everything was as we’d observed earlier. He whispered to me, just audible:\n\n\"Even the slightest noise could ruin our plan.\"\n\nI nodded in understanding.\n\n\"We must sit in darkness—he’d see even a little light through the ventilator.\"\n\nI nodded again.\n\n\"Stay awake. Your life may depend on it. Keep your gun ready in case we need it. I'll sit on the bed; you take the chair.\"\n\nI set my revolver on the table. Holmes placed a thin cane, some matches, and a candle stump beside the bed, then dimmed the lamp, plunging us into darkness.\n\nThat night felt endless and dreadful. I heard nothing—not even Holmes’s breathing—but I was certain he sat nearby, just as anxious as I was. With the shutters blocking out every trace of light, we waited in absolute blackness.\n\nNow and then we heard a night bird outside, and once, right by the window, a drawn-out, catlike whine told us the cheetah was prowling. In the distance, the parish clock tolled every quarter hour, making each period feel longer. When it struck twelve, then one, two, and three, we waited in silence, braced for anything.\n\nSuddenly, a flicker of light appeared at the ventilator—then vanished—followed by a strong smell of burning oil and hot metal: someone in the adjoining room had lit a dark lantern. I heard faint movement, then nothing, except the smell grew stronger. For half an hour I listened, tense, until a new sound became clear: a soft, continuous hiss, like steam escaping a kettle. Instantly, Holmes leapt from the bed, lit a match, and beat wildly at the bell-pull with his cane.\n\n\"Do you see it, Watson?\" he shouted. \"Do you see it?\"\n\nBut I saw nothing. As he struck the light, I heard a low whistle, but the sudden brightness stunned my tired eyes, and I couldn't see what Holmes was frantically attacking. His face was pale, horrified, and he had stopped swinging, staring at the ventilator. Suddenly a dreadful scream broke the night—louder and louder—a mixture of pain, terror, and rage. They say it woke people all through the village and even the remote parsonage. The cry chilled us to the bone; Holmes and I stared at each other until the echoes faded away.\n\n\"What does it mean?\" I asked, breathless.\n\n\"It means it’s all over,\" Holmes replied. \"And maybe, in the end, that’s for the best. Grab your gun and let’s enter Dr. Roylott’s room.\"\n\nSolemnly, Holmes lit the lamp and led me down the corridor. Twice he knocked at the bedroom door, but got no answer. He turned the handle and we entered; I followed with my pistol ready.\n\nThe scene inside was strange. On the table stood a partially open dark lantern, its beam aimed at the iron safe, which stood open. Dr. Grimesby Roylott sat in a wooden chair in a grey dressing-gown, his bare ankles exposed above red, backless Turkish slippers. Across his lap lay the coiled whip we’d noticed earlier. His chin was raised, eyes staring rigidly at the ceiling corner. Around his head was a strange yellow band, speckled with brown, tightly bound. As we entered, he showed no sign.\n\n\"The band! The speckled band!\" Holmes whispered.\n\nI stepped closer. Suddenly, the odd headband began to move, and out crawled the squat, diamond-shaped head and swollen neck of a vile snake.\n\n\"It’s a swamp adder!\" cried Holmes. \"The deadliest snake in India. He died within ten seconds of the bite. Violent men often meet violent ends; he fell into his own trap. Let’s put this creature away and get Miss Stoner somewhere safe, then alert the police.\"\n\nWith that, Holmes swiftly looped the dog-whip around the snake, dragged it from Roylott’s body, and threw it in the safe, closing the door securely.\n\nThese are the real events that led to Dr. Roylott’s death. There’s no need to lengthen this story by describing in detail how we broke the dreadful news to his terrified stepdaughter, or how we took her by morning train to her kind aunt in Harrow, or how the official inquiry decided that Roylott died while carelessly handling a dangerous animal. The few remaining details were explained to me by Holmes on our journey home the next day.\n\n\"I had drawn a completely wrong conclusion, Watson,\" said he. \"It just goes to show how risky it is to form theories with too little information. The gypsies and the word 'band'—used by the poor girl to describe something she glimpsed by match-light—led me down the wrong path. My only merit was that I changed my mind as soon as it became clear the danger to anybody in the room couldn’t come through the window or door. My attention quickly turned to the ventilator and the bell-rope beside the bed. When I found the rope was fake, and the bed was fixed to the floor, it suggested the rope served as a bridge for something to travel from the vent to the bed. I immediately thought of a snake, especially since I knew the doctor kept exotic creatures. Using an undetectable poison is exactly the kind of idea a ruthless, clever man with experience in the East would devise. Such a toxin works rapidly—and only a sharp-eyed coroner could find the little puncture marks left by the snake’s fangs. The presence of a whistle made sense; the doctor had to call back the snake before morning. He likely trained it, perhaps with the milk we saw, to come at his whistle. He’d send it through the ventilator at whatever hour best suited him, confident it would slide down the rope to the bed. Maybe the victim would escape for a few nights, but eventually, she’d be bitten.\n\n\"I’d reached these conclusions even before we entered his room. Seeing the chair suggested he stood on it to reach the vent. The obviously staged safe, milk saucer, and whipcord finished the picture: the metallic clang Miss Stoner heard was the safe slamming shut on the snake. Once I put it all together, you know the steps I took to prove it. I heard the creature hiss—no doubt you did, too—and I lit the light and attacked.\"\n\n\"Which made it go back through the ventilator.\"\n\n\"And caused it to turn on its master. Some of my blows probably hit, riling it so it attacked the first person it saw. So, I am, in a way, responsible for Dr. Roylott’s death, but I won’t lose sleep over it.\""

          "text_segment": "It was in the summer of ’89, not long after my marriage, that the events occurred which I am now about to summarise. I had returned to civil practice and had finally abandoned Holmes in his Baker Street rooms, although I continually visited him and occasionally even persuaded him to forgo his Bohemian habits so far as to come and visit us. My practice had steadily increased, and as I happened to live at no very great distance from Paddington Station, I got a few patients from among the officials. One of these, whom I had cured of a painful and lingering disease, was never weary of advertising my virtues and of endeavouring to send me on every sufferer over whom he might have any influence.\nOne morning, at a little before seven o’clock, I was awakened by the maid tapping at the door to announce that two men had come from Paddington and were waiting in the consulting-room. I dressed hurriedly, for I knew by experience that railway cases were seldom trivial, and hastened downstairs. As I descended, my old ally, the guard, came out of the room and closed the door tightly behind him.\n“I’ve got him here,” he whispered, jerking his thumb over his shoulder; “he’s all right.”\n“What is it, then?” I asked, for his manner suggested that it was some strange creature which he had caged up in my room.\n“It’s a new patient,” he whispered. “I thought I’d bring him round myself; then he couldn’t slip away. There he is, all safe and sound. I must go now, Doctor; I have my dooties, just the same as you.” And off he went, this trusty tout, without even giving me time to thank him.\nI entered my consulting-room and found a gentleman seated by the table. He was quietly dressed in a suit of heather tweed with a soft cloth cap which he had laid down upon my books. Round one of his hands he had a handkerchief wrapped, which was mottled all over with bloodstains. He was young, not more than five-and-twenty, I should say, with a strong, masculine face; but he was exceedingly pale and gave me the impression of a man who was suffering from some strong agitation, which it took all his strength of mind to control.\n“I am sorry to knock you up so early, Doctor,” said he, “but I have had a very serious accident during the night. I came in by train this morning, and on inquiring at Paddington as to where I might find a doctor, a worthy fellow very kindly escorted me here. I gave the maid a card, but I see that she has left it upon the side-table.”\nI took it up and glanced at it. “Mr. Victor Hatherley, hydraulic engineer, 16A, Victoria Street (3rd floor).” That was the name, style, and abode of my morning visitor. “I regret that I have kept you waiting,” said I, sitting down in my library-chair. “You are fresh from a night journey, I understand, which is in itself a monotonous occupation.”\n“Oh, my night could not be called monotonous,” said he, and laughed. He laughed very heartily, with a high, ringing note, leaning back in his chair and shaking his sides. All my medical instincts rose up against that laugh.",
          "paraphrase_gemini-2.5-flash-preview-04-17": "The events I am about to recount took place during the summer of 1889, shortly after I got married. Having resumed my private medical practice and no longer sharing rooms with Holmes in Baker Street (though I still visited him frequently and occasionally persuaded him to abandon his unconventional lifestyle to visit my wife and me), my practice was thriving. Living close to Paddington Station meant I treated several railway employees. One particular official, whom I had successfully treated for a chronic ailment, was a tireless advocate for my skills, always trying to direct anyone needing medical help my way. Early one morning, just before seven, my maid woke me with a tap at the door, informing me that two men from Paddington were waiting in my consulting room. Knowing from experience that medical issues originating from the railway were often serious, I quickly got dressed and hurried downstairs. As I reached the bottom of the stairs, my reliable friend, the guard, emerged from the room, carefully shutting the door. He gestured over his shoulder with his thumb and whispered, \"He's in here; he's fine.\" His secretive behaviour made me ask, \"What is it, then?\", as if he had confined some unusual being in my room. \"It's a new patient,\" he murmured back. \"I decided to bring him myself to make sure he didn't disappear. He's in there, quite safe. I have to leave now, Doctor; duty calls, just like for you.\" And my dependable contact hurried off without giving me a chance to express my gratitude. Entering my consulting room, I found a gentleman seated by the table. He wore a simple suit of heather tweed and had placed his soft cloth cap on top of my books. One of his hands was wrapped in a bloodstained handkerchief. He appeared young, perhaps no older than twenty-five, with a sturdy, manly face. However, he was extremely pale, suggesting he was struggling to contain intense emotional distress with considerable mental effort. \"I apologise for disturbing you at this hour, Doctor,\" he said, \"but I had a severe accident overnight. I arrived by train this morning, and when I asked at Paddington for a doctor, a kind man graciously brought me here. I gave the maid my card, which I see she has left on the side table.\" I picked it up and read it. It identified my visitor as \"Mr. Victor Hatherley, hydraulic engineer, residing at 16A, Victoria Street (3rd floor).\" Sitting down in my library chair, I said, \"I'm sorry to have kept you waiting. You've just completed a night journey, I gather, which can be quite tedious in itself.\" \"Oh, my night was anything but tedious,\" he replied, and then he laughed. It was a robust, high-pitched laugh that echoed as he leaned back, shaking with amusement. Immediately, my professional medical intuition reacted negatively to his laughter.",

Upon entering, I found a young man dressed in heather tweed, his hand wrapped in a blood-stained handkerchief, looking pale and clearly shaken. He apologized for the early hour and explained that he had sustained a serious injury during the night and, after arriving by train, was guided to me by a helpful man at Paddington. He handed a card to my maid, which she left on the side table, introducing himself as Mr. Victor Hatherley, a hydraulic engineer residing at 16A Victoria Street.

Do you feel equal to it?”\n“Yes; I shall not feel easy until I have told my story.”\n“Then my servant will call a cab, and I shall be with you in an instant.” I rushed upstairs, explained the matter shortly to my wife, and in five minutes was inside a hansom, driving with my new acquaintance to Baker Street.",

I was quite weak, but I’ve been through a lot.” “Perhaps it would be better if you didn’t discuss it. It’s clearly upsetting for you.” “Oh, no, I’m fine now. I’ll have to recount my experience to the police later; but, honestly, if it weren’t for the clear proof of this injury of mine, I doubt they would believe my account, as it’s highly unusual, and I have very little evidence to support it; and even if they accept my story, the leads I can provide are so vague that it’s questionable whether justice will be achieved.” “Aha!” I exclaimed, “if your situation involves a puzzle that you wish to have solved, I strongly suggest you consult my friend, Mr. Sherlock Holmes, before approaching the authorities.” “Oh, I’ve heard of him,” my visitor replied, “and I would be very grateful if he would look into this matter, although naturally I must still involve the official police. Could you introduce me to him?” “I’ll do better than that. I’ll take you there myself.” “I would be enormously thankful.” “We’ll hail a cab and go together. We’ll arrive just in time to join him for a bit of breakfast. Do you feel up to it?” “Yes; I won’t feel settled until I’ve shared my story.” “Then my attendant will summon a cab, and I’ll be right with you.” I hurried upstairs, quickly explained the situation to my wife, and within five minutes, I was inside a hansom carriage, heading to Baker Street with my new companion.",

I was extremely weak after all I’ve endured.\"\n\"Maybe it’s best you don’t discuss it now — it clearly affects your nerves.\"\n\"No, I’m all right now. I’ll have to recount it to the police anyway. Honestly, if I didn’t have this wound as evidence, I doubt they’d believe such an unusual story. Even so, the details I have to support it are so vague that it might be hard for justice to be served.\"\n\"Ah! If this is a mystery you want solved,\" I exclaimed, \"I highly recommend you see my friend, Mr. Sherlock Holmes, before going to the police.\"\n\"I’ve heard of him,\" my guest replied, \"and I’d be grateful if he took up the case. Of course, I’ll still need to inform the police. Could you introduce me?\"\n\"Even better — I’ll take you to him myself.\"\n\"I’d be much obliged.\"\n\"Let’s get a cab and go together. We should arrive just in time for breakfast with him. Are you up for it?\"\n\"Yes, I won’t rest until I share my story.\"\n\"Then my servant will call a cab, and I’ll join you in a moment.\" I hurried upstairs, briefly explained the situation to my wife, and a few minutes later, I was in a hansom cab with my new companion on our way to Baker Street."

By profession I am a hydraulic engineer, and I have had considerable experience of my work during the seven years that I was apprenticed to Venner & Matheson, the well-known firm, of Greenwich. Two years ago, having served my time, and having also come into a fair sum of money through my poor father’s death, I determined to start in business for myself and took professional chambers in Victoria Street.\n“I suppose that everyone finds his first independent start in business a dreary experience. To me it has been exceptionally so. During two years I have had three consultations and one small job, and that is absolutely all that my profession has brought me. My gross takings amount to £ 27 10s. Every day, from nine in the morning until four in the afternoon, I waited in my little den, until at last my heart began to sink, and I came to believe that I should never have any practice at all.\n“Yesterday, however, just as I was thinking of leaving the office, my clerk entered to say there was a gentleman waiting who wished to see me upon business. He brought up a card, too, with the name of ‘Colonel Lysander Stark’ engraved upon it. Close at his heels came the colonel himself, a man rather over the middle size, but of an exceeding thinness. I do not think that I have ever seen so thin a man. His whole face sharpened away into nose and chin, and the skin of his cheeks was drawn quite tense over his outstanding bones. Yet this emaciation seemed to be his natural habit, and due to no disease, for his eye was bright, his step brisk, and his bearing assured. He was plainly but neatly dressed, and his age, I should judge, would be nearer forty than thirty.\n“‘Mr. Hatherley?’ said he, with something of a German accent. ‘You have been recommended to me, Mr. Hatherley, as being a man who is not only proficient in his profession but is also discreet and capable of preserving a secret.’\n“I bowed, feeling as flattered as any young man would at such an address. ‘May I ask who it was who gave me so good a character?’\n“‘Well, perhaps it is better that I should not tell you that just at this moment. I have it from the same source that you are both an orphan and a bachelor and are residing alone in London.’\n“‘That is quite correct,’ I answered; ‘but you will excuse me if I say that I cannot see how all this bears upon my professional qualifications. I understand that it was on a professional matter that you wished to speak to me?’\n“‘Undoubtedly so. But you will find that all I say is really to the point. I have a professional commission for you, but absolute secrecy is quite essential—absolute secrecy, you understand, and of course we may expect that more from a man who is alone than from one who lives in the bosom of his family.’\n“‘If I promise to keep a secret,’ said I, ‘you may absolutely depend upon my doing so.’\n“He looked very hard at me as I spoke, and it seemed to me that I had never seen so suspicious and questioning an eye.\n“‘Do you promise, then?’ said he at last.\n“‘Yes, I promise.’\n“‘Absolute and complete silence before, during, and after? No reference to the matter at all, either in word or writing?’\n“‘I have already given you my word.’\n“‘Very good.’ He suddenly sprang up, and darting like lightning across the room he flung open the door. The passage outside was empty.\n“‘That’s all right,’ said he, coming back. ‘I know that clerks are sometimes curious as to their master’s affairs. Now we can talk in safety.’ He drew up his chair very close to mine and began to stare at me again with the same questioning and thoughtful look.\n“A feeling of repulsion, and of something akin to fear had begun to rise within me at the strange antics of this fleshless man. Even my dread of losing a client could not restrain me from showing my impatience.\n“‘I beg that you will state your business, sir,’ said I; ‘my time is of value.’ Heaven forgive me for that last sentence, but the words came to my lips.\n“‘How would fifty guineas for a night’s work suit you?’ he asked.\n“‘Most admirably.’\n“‘I say a night’s work, but an hour’s would be nearer the mark. I simply want your opinion about a hydraulic stamping machine which has got out of gear. If you show us what is wrong we shall soon set it right ourselves. What do you think of such a commission as that?’\n“‘The work appears to be light and the pay munificent.’\n“‘Precisely so. We shall want you to come to-night by the last train.’\n“‘Where to?’\n“‘To Eyford, in Berkshire. It is a little place near the borders of Oxfordshire, and within seven miles of Reading. There is a train from Paddington which would bring you there at about 11:15.’\n“‘Very good.’\n“‘I shall come down in a carriage to meet you.’\n“‘There is a drive, then?’\n“‘Yes, our little place is quite out in the country. It is a good seven miles from Eyford Station.’\n“‘Then we can hardly get there before midnight. I suppose there would be no chance of a train back. I should be compelled to stop the night.’\n“‘Yes, we could easily give you a shake-down.’\n“‘That is very awkward. Could I not come at some more convenient hour?’\n“‘We have judged it best that you should come late. It is to recompense you for any inconvenience that we are paying to you, a young and unknown man, a fee which would buy an opinion from the very heads of your profession. Still, of course, if you would like to draw out of the business, there is plenty of time to do so.’\n“I thought of the fifty guineas, and of how very useful they would be to me. ‘Not at all,’ said I, ‘I shall be very happy to accommodate myself to your wishes. I should like, however, to understand a little more clearly what it is that you wish me to do.’\n“‘Quite so. It is very natural that the pledge of secrecy which we have exacted from you should have aroused your curiosity. I have no wish to commit you to anything without your having it all laid before you. I suppose that we are absolutely safe from eavesdroppers?’\n“‘Entirely.’\n“‘Then the matter stands thus. You are probably aware that fuller’s-earth is a valuable product, and that it is only found in one or two places in England?’\n“‘I have heard so.’\n“‘Some little time ago I bought a small place—a very small place—within ten miles of Reading. I was fortunate enough to discover that there was a deposit of fuller’s-earth in one of my fields. On examining it, however, I found that this deposit was a comparatively small one, and that it formed a link between two very much larger ones upon the right and left—both of them, however, in the grounds of my neighbours. These good people were absolutely ignorant that their land contained that which was quite as valuable as a gold-mine. Naturally, it was to my interest to buy their land before they discovered its true value, but unfortunately I had no capital by which I could do this. I took a few of my friends into the secret, however, and they suggested that we should quietly and secretly work our own little deposit and that in this way we should earn the money which would enable us to buy the neighbouring fields. This we have now been doing for some time, and in order to help us in our operations we erected a hydraulic press. This press, as I have already explained, has got out of order, and we wish your advice upon the subject. We guard our secret very jealously, however, and if it once became known that we had hydraulic engineers coming to our little house, it would soon rouse inquiry, and then, if the facts came out, it would be good-bye to any chance of getting these fields and carrying out our plans. That is why I have made you promise me that you will not tell a human being that you are going to Eyford to-night. I hope that I make it all plain?’\n“‘I quite follow you,’ said I. ‘The only point which I could not quite understand was what use you could make of a hydraulic press in excavating fuller’s-earth, which, as I understand, is dug out like gravel from a pit.’\n“‘Ah!’ said he carelessly, ‘we have our own process. We compress the earth into bricks, so as to remove them without revealing what they are. But that is a mere detail. I have taken you fully into my confidence now, Mr. Hatherley, and I have shown you how I trust you.’ He rose as he spoke. ‘I shall expect you, then, at Eyford at 11:15.’\n“‘I shall certainly be there.’\n“‘And not a word to a soul.’ He looked at me with a last long, questioning gaze, and then, pressing my hand in a cold, dank grasp, he hurried from the room.",
          "paraphrase_gemini-2.5-flash-preview-04-17": "The speaker explained that he was an orphan living alone in London, unmarried. He worked as a hydraulic engineer, having gained significant experience over seven years while training with the well-known Greenwich company Venner & Matheson. Two years prior, after completing his apprenticeship and receiving a substantial inheritance from his deceased father, he decided to open his own business and rented professional space on Victoria Street. Starting his own venture proved exceptionally disheartening. In the two years since, his total professional income amounted to just £27 10 shillings, derived from only three consultations and one minor project. He spent every day from nine until four waiting in his office, gradually losing hope and believing he would never establish a successful practice. However, yesterday, as he was about to leave for the day, his clerk announced a gentleman visitor for business. The clerk presented a card bearing the name 'Colonel Lysander Stark'. Immediately after the clerk, the colonel himself entered. He was a man slightly taller than average but remarkably slender. The speaker thought he had never encountered anyone so thin; his face seemed to narrow down to just nose and chin, with the skin pulled tightly over his prominent bones. Despite this extreme thinness, it appeared to be his natural state rather than a sign of illness, as his eyes were lively, his walk energetic, and his demeanor confident. He was dressed simply but neatly, and the speaker estimated his age to be closer to forty than thirty. With a slight German accent, he addressed the speaker, saying, \"'Mr. Hatherley?' You were recommended to me, Mr. Hatherley, not only for your skill in your profession but also for your discretion and ability to maintain secrecy.\" Flattered, as any young man would be by such praise, the speaker bowed and asked who had given him such a glowing recommendation. The colonel replied that it might be better not to disclose the source at that moment. He added that the same person had informed him the speaker was an orphan, unmarried, and lived alone in London. \"That's quite right,\" the speaker confirmed, \"but you must forgive me for saying I don't see how any of this relates to my qualifications as a professional. I understood you wished to discuss a professional matter?\" \"Certainly,\" the colonel affirmed. \"But you'll find everything I say is pertinent. I have a professional job for you, but complete secrecy is absolutely crucial—absolute secrecy, you understand. And naturally, we expect that more readily from someone living alone than from someone with a family.\" The speaker stated, \"If I promise to keep a secret, you can completely rely on me to do so.\" As he spoke, the colonel stared intently at him, and the speaker felt he had never encountered such a suspicious and questioning gaze. \"Do you promise, then?\" the colonel finally asked. \"Yes, I promise,\" the speaker replied. \"Absolute and total silence,\" the colonel pressed, \"before, during, and after? No mention of the matter at all, whether spoken or written?\" \"I have already given you my word,\" the speaker reiterated. \"Excellent,\" the colonel said. He suddenly jumped up, swiftly moved across the room, and threw open the door. The corridor outside was empty. \"That's fine,\" he said, returning to the room. \"I know that clerks can sometimes be inquisitive about their employer's business. Now we can speak safely.\" He pulled his chair very close to the speaker's and resumed staring with the same questioning and thoughtful expression. A sense of aversion, bordering on fear, began to develop in the speaker due to the strange behavior of this exceptionally thin man. Even his fear of losing a potential client couldn't stop him from showing his impatience. \"Please, sir,\" he said, \"I must ask you to state your business; my time is valuable.\" He later regretted that last part, but the words came out. \"How would fifty guineas for one night's work suit you?\" the colonel inquired. \"Perfectly,\" the speaker replied. \"I say a night's work,\" he continued, \"but it will likely be closer to an hour. I merely need your professional assessment on a hydraulic stamping machine that isn't working correctly. If you can identify the problem, we can easily repair it ourselves. What are your thoughts on this task?\" \"The job sounds easy, and the pay is extremely generous.\" \"Exactly. We'll need you to travel tonight on the last train.\" \"Where should I go?\" the speaker asked. \"To Eyford, in Berkshire,\" the colonel answered. \"It's a small village near the Oxfordshire boundary, about seven miles from Reading. There's a train from Paddington that arrives around 11:15.\" \"Very well.\" \"I will come to the station in a carriage to pick you up.\" \"So, it's a drive?\" \"Yes, our place is quite isolated in the countryside. It's a good seven miles from Eyford Station.\" \"Then we likely won't reach there before midnight,\" the speaker calculated. \"I presume there won't be a train back. I'd be forced to stay the night.\" \"Yes, we could easily provide you with a place to sleep.\" \"That's very inconvenient,\" the speaker replied. \"Could I not visit at a more suitable time?\" \"We decided it would be best for you to come late,\" the colonel explained. \"The substantial fee we are offering you, a young and unknown man—a fee that would normally secure advice from the top experts in your field—is intended to compensate you for this inconvenience. However, of course, if you prefer not to take the job, there is still plenty of time to decline.\" The speaker considered the fifty guineas and how desperately he needed the money. \"Not at all,\" he said. \"I am happy to adapt to your requirements. However, I would like a clearer understanding of what you need me to do.\" \"Quite right,\" the colonel agreed. \"It's natural that the requirement for secrecy has piqued your interest. I don't want you to commit to anything without knowing all the details. Are we absolutely sure no one is listening?\" \"Completely,\" the speaker confirmed. \"Then here is the situation,\" the colonel began. \"You are probably aware that fuller's earth is a valuable substance found in very few locations in England. Some time ago, I purchased a small property—a very modest one—within ten miles of Reading. I was fortunate enough to discover a deposit of fuller's earth on one of my fields. However, upon inspection, this deposit was relatively small and acted as a connector between two much larger deposits located on my neighbors' properties to the right and left. These neighbors were completely unaware that their land contained something as valuable as a gold mine. Naturally, my goal was to buy their land before they realized its true worth, but unfortunately, I lacked the funds. I did, however, share the secret with a few friends. They suggested that we quietly and discreetly excavate our own small deposit to generate the capital needed to acquire the neighboring fields. We've been doing this for some time, and to assist our work, we installed a hydraulic press. As I mentioned, this press is currently malfunctioning, and we need your expert advice. We are extremely careful about keeping our secret, though. If it became known that we were having hydraulic engineers visit our small house, it would quickly attract suspicion, and if the truth came out, we would lose any chance of buying those fields and completing our plan. That is why I made you promise not to tell a single person you are going to Eyford tonight. I hope I have explained everything clearly?\" \"I understand completely,\" the speaker replied. \"The only thing I didn't quite grasp was how you would use a hydraulic press to dig fuller's earth, which I understood was extracted like gravel from a pit.\" \"Ah,\" the colonel said casually, \"we have a unique method. We compress the earth into bricks so we can remove them without revealing what they are. But that's just a minor detail. I have now shared everything with you, Mr. Hatherley, showing you how much I trust you.\" He stood up as he spoke. \"I will expect you at Eyford at 11:15 then.\" \"I will certainly be there,\" the speaker confirmed. \"And not a word to anyone,\" the colonel added. He gave the speaker one last long, scrutinizing look, then shook his hand with a cold, clammy grip before quickly leaving the room.",

God forgive me for adding that, but I couldn’t help it.\n\n‘How does fifty guineas for a night’s work sound?’ he asked.\n\n‘Excellent.’\n\n‘Actually, the work will take about an hour. I just need your opinion on a malfunctioning hydraulic stamping machine. If you point out the issue, we’ll handle the repairs. Does that suit you?’\n\n‘The work seems light and the pay generous.’\n\n‘Exactly. We need you to come tonight on the last train.’\n\n‘Where to?’\n\n‘To Eyford, Berkshire, near the Oxfordshire border and about seven miles from Reading. There’s a Paddington train arriving around 11:15.’\n\n‘Very well.’\n\n‘I’ll pick you up in a carriage.’\n\n‘So it’s a bit of a drive?’\n\n‘Yes, our place is quite remote, a good seven miles from the station.’\n\n‘We won’t arrive before midnight, then, and I guess there won’t be a train back. I’ll need to stay overnight.’\n\n‘We can arrange for you to stay.’\n\n‘That’s inconvenient. Couldn’t I come at a better time?’\n\n‘It’s best for us if you come late. We’re paying you so much to make up for the trouble, especially as you’re young and unknown. If you wish to decline, there’s still time.’\n\nI thought of the fifty guineas and how much I needed them. ‘Not at all,’ I assured him. ‘I’m happy to comply, but I’d like to know more about what’s required.’\n\n‘Of course. It’s only natural that our secrecy has piqued your interest. I want you to be clear before committing. Are we free from eavesdroppers?’\n\n‘Completely.’\n\n‘Here’s the situation. You’ve probably heard that fuller’s earth is very valuable and rare in England?’\n\n‘So I understand.’\n\n‘Recently, I bought a small property within ten miles of Reading and found a poor deposit of fuller’s earth, linking two much richer deposits in neighboring land—unknown to my neighbors. Naturally, I aimed to buy their land, but lacked funds. Some friends suggested we quietly exploit our own tiny deposit to earn enough to buy the others. To help our operations, we built a hydraulic press, which has now broken. That’s why we need your advice. Our secrecy is vital, as bringing an engineer there could arouse suspicion, jeopardizing our plans. That’s why I required your complete confidentiality. I hope that clarifies things.’\n\n‘I understand,’ I said. ‘But why use a hydraulic press for excavating fuller’s earth? Isn’t it just dug out of a pit?’\n\n‘We have our own process,’ he replied nonchalantly. ‘We compress the earth into bricks to transport it without attracting attention. But that’s a detail. I’ve trusted you entirely, Mr. Hatherley. I’ll expect you at Eyford at 11:15.’\n\n‘I’ll be there.’\n\n‘Not a word to anyone.’ He gave me a long, searching look, then shook my hand with a cold, clammy grip, and swiftly left the room."

He sat at my side in silence all the time, and I was aware, more than once when I glanced in his direction, that he was looking at me with great intensity. The country roads seem to be not very good in that part of the world, for we lurched and jolted terribly. I tried to look out of the windows to see something of where we were, but they were made of frosted glass, and I could make out nothing save the occasional bright blur of a passing light. Now and then I hazarded some remark to break the monotony of the journey, but the colonel answered only in monosyllables, and the conversation soon flagged. At last, however, the bumping of the road was exchanged for the crisp smoothness of a gravel-drive, and the carriage came to a stand. Colonel Lysander Stark sprang out, and, as I followed after him, pulled me swiftly into a porch which gaped in front of us. We stepped, as it were, right out of the carriage and into the hall, so that I failed to catch the most fleeting glance of the front of the house. The instant that I had crossed the threshold the door slammed heavily behind us, and I heard faintly the rattle of the wheels as the carriage drove away.\n“It was pitch dark inside the house, and the colonel fumbled about looking for matches and muttering under his breath. Suddenly a door opened at the other end of the passage, and a long, golden bar of light shot out in our direction. It grew broader, and a woman appeared with a lamp in her hand, which she held above her head, pushing her face forward and peering at us. I could see that she was pretty, and from the gloss with which the light shone upon her dark dress I knew that it was a rich material. She spoke a few words in a foreign tongue in a tone as though asking a question, and when my companion answered in a gruff monosyllable she gave such a start that the lamp nearly fell from her hand. Colonel Stark went up to her, whispered something in her ear, and then, pushing her back into the room from whence she had come, he walked towards me again with the lamp in his hand.\n“‘Perhaps you will have the kindness to wait in this room for a few minutes,’ said he, throwing open another door. It was a quiet, little, plainly furnished room, with a round table in the centre, on which several German books were scattered.

The local roads seemed to be in poor condition, as we were badly shaken and jolted. I attempted to look out the windows to see our location, but they were frosted glass, making it impossible to see anything except the occasional bright blur of passing lights. From time to time, I made an attempt to talk to relieve the tedium of the trip, but the colonel responded only in single words, and the conversation quickly ceased. Finally, the bumpy road gave way to the smooth surface of a gravel drive, and the carriage came to a halt. Colonel Lysander Stark got out quickly, and as I followed, he swiftly pulled me into a porch directly in front of us. We moved, effectively, straight from the carriage into the entrance hall, preventing me from getting even a brief look at the house's exterior. The moment I stepped inside, the door closed heavily behind us, and I faintly heard the sound of the wheels as the carriage drove away. Inside the house, it was completely dark, and the colonel fumbled around, searching for matches and mumbling softly. Suddenly, a door opened at the far end of the corridor, and a long, golden shaft of light streamed towards us. The light widened, and a woman appeared, holding a lamp high above her head and leaning forward to examine us. I could see she was attractive, and the way the light glinted off her dark dress told me it was made of expensive fabric. She spoke a few words in a foreign language, sounding like a question.

Then I walked across to the window, hoping that I might catch some glimpse of the country-side, but an oak shutter, heavily barred, was folded across it. It was a wonderfully silent house. There was an old clock ticking loudly somewhere in the passage, but otherwise everything was deadly still. A vague feeling of uneasiness began to steal over me. Who were these German people, and what were they doing living in this strange, out-of-the-way place? And where was the place? I was ten miles or so from Eyford, that was all I knew, but whether north, south, east, or west I had no idea. For that matter, Reading, and possibly other large towns, were within that radius, so the place might not be so secluded, after all. Yet it was quite certain, from the absolute stillness, that we were in the country. I paced up and down the room, humming a tune under my breath to keep up my spirits and feeling that I was thoroughly earning my fifty-guinea fee.\n“Suddenly, without any preliminary sound in the midst of the utter stillness, the door of my room swung slowly open. The woman was standing in the aperture, the darkness of the hall behind her, the yellow light from my lamp beating upon her eager and beautiful face. I could see at a glance that she was sick with fear, and the sight sent a chill to my own heart. She held up one shaking finger to warn me to be silent, and she shot a few whispered words of broken English at me, her eyes glancing back, like those of a frightened horse, into the gloom behind her.\n“‘I would go,’ said she, trying hard, as it seemed to me, to speak calmly; ‘I would go. I should not stay here. There is no good for you to do.’\n“‘But, madam,’ said I, ‘I have not yet done what I came for. I cannot possibly leave until I have seen the machine.’\n“‘It is not worth your while to wait,’ she went on. ‘You can pass through the door; no one hinders.’ And then, seeing that I smiled and shook my head, she suddenly threw aside her constraint and made a step forward, with her hands wrung together. ‘For the love of Heaven!’ she whispered, ‘get away from here before it is too late!’\n“But I am somewhat headstrong by nature, and the more ready to engage in an affair when there is some obstacle in the way. I thought of my fifty-guinea fee, of my wearisome journey, and of the unpleasant night which seemed to be before me. Was it all to go for nothing? Why should I slink away without having carried out my commission, and without the payment which was my due? This woman might, for all I knew, be a monomaniac. With a stout bearing, therefore, though her manner had shaken me more than I cared to confess, I still shook my head and declared my intention of remaining where I was. She was about to renew her entreaties when a door slammed overhead, and the sound of several footsteps was heard upon the stairs. She listened for an instant, threw up her hands with a despairing gesture, and vanished as suddenly and as noiselessly as she had come.\n“The newcomers were Colonel Lysander Stark and a short thick man with a chinchilla beard growing out of the creases of his double chin, who was introduced to me as Mr. Ferguson.\n“‘This is my secretary and manager,’ said the colonel. ‘By the way, I was under the impression that I left this door shut just now. I fear that you have felt the draught.’\n“‘On the contrary,’ said I, ‘I opened the door myself because I felt the room to be a little close.’\n“He shot one of his suspicious looks at me. ‘Perhaps we had better proceed to business, then,’ said he. ‘Mr. Ferguson and I will take you up to see the machine.’\n“‘I had better put my hat on, I suppose.’\n“‘Oh, no, it is in the house.’\n“‘What, you dig fuller’s-earth in the house?’\n“‘No, no.

Though I couldn't read German, I could tell two were scientific texts, while the others were poetry collections. Moving to the window, I hoped to catch a glimpse of the surrounding countryside, but a thick, heavily barred oak shutter was closed over it. The house was remarkably quiet. An old clock in the hallway was ticking loudly, but otherwise, there was absolute stillness. A creeping sense of unease began to settle over me. Who were these German inhabitants, and why were they living in such a strange, isolated location? And precisely where was this place? I knew I was roughly ten miles from Eyford, but I had no idea of the direction – north, south, east, or west. It occurred to me that Reading, and possibly other significant towns, could be within that radius, so the location might not be as remote as it seemed. Yet, the profound quietness confirmed we were definitely in a rural setting. I walked back and forth across the room, softly humming to myself to keep my spirits up, feeling that I was certainly earning my fifty-guinea fee.\n\nSuddenly, without any warning sound amidst the profound quiet, my door slowly swung open. The woman stood in the doorway, the dark hall behind her, with the yellow glow from my lamp illuminating her tense, beautiful face. I could immediately see she was ill with fright, and the sight chilled me too. She raised a trembling finger, urging me to be silent, and spoke a few whispered words in broken English, her eyes darting back towards the gloom behind her like those of a frightened horse.\n\n“‘You should go,’ she said, trying hard, it seemed, to sound calm; ‘You should go. You must not stay here. There is nothing good for you to do.’\n\n‘But, madam,’ I replied, ‘I have not yet completed the task I came for. I absolutely cannot leave until I have seen the machine.’\n\n‘It is not worth your time to wait,’ she continued. ‘You can simply walk through the door; no one will stop you.’ Then, seeing my smile and headshake, she suddenly dropped her composure, stepped forward, and clasped her hands together. ‘For the love of Heaven!’ she whispered intensely, ‘leave this place before it’s too late!’\n\nHowever, I tend to be rather stubborn by nature, and I become more inclined to tackle a situation when there’s an obstacle involved. I thought of my fifty-guinea payment, my tiring journey, and the unpleasant night I anticipated. Was it all to be wasted? Why should I sneak away without fulfilling my commission and receiving the payment I was owed? For all I knew, this woman might be delusional. So, maintaining a firm stance, although her fear had shaken me more than I cared to admit, I still shook my head and stated clearly that I intended to remain where I was.

There could be large towns like Reading nearby, so maybe the place wasn't as isolated as it seemed, yet the silence made it clear we were in the countryside. I paced the room, softly humming a tune to calm myself, feeling that I was truly earning my fifty-guinea fee.\n\nWithout warning, the door opened silently. A woman appeared in the doorway, the dark hallway behind her, and her anxious, beautiful face lit by the lamp. I could immediately see she was terrified, which made me nervous too. Raising a trembling finger, she signaled me to be quiet and whispered hurriedly in broken English, glancing fearfully back into the darkness.\n\nShe said, struggling to remain calm, \"I would go. I would not stay here. There is nothing good for you to do.\"\n\nI replied, \"But madam, I haven't yet accomplished my task. I can't leave before I see the machine.\"\n\nShe insisted, \"It isn't worth your time to stay. You can leave; no one is stopping you.\" When I smiled and shook my head, she became more desperate, stepping forward with clenched hands. In a strained whisper, she begged, \"For Heaven's sake, get away from here before it's too late!\"\n\nBut since I tend to be stubborn, I was actually more eager to stick with a task if there was some obstacle involved. I considered my fee, the effort of traveling there, and the unpleasant night awaiting me. Should I leave empty-handed? Why should I give up my commission and the money I was promised? For all I knew, the woman might not be in her right mind. Trying to appear confident—though her warning had rattled me more than I wanted to admit—I insisted on staying. She was about to plead again when a door slammed upstairs and several people started coming down the stairs. She listened briefly, threw up her hands in despair, and disappeared as quickly as she had appeared.\n\nThe newcomers were Colonel Lysander Stark and a short, heavyset man with a chinchilla beard growing from the folds of his chin, who was introduced as Mr. Ferguson.\n\n\"This is my secretary and manager,\" the colonel said. \"By the way, I thought I left this door closed. Maybe you felt a draft.\"\n\n\"Actually,\" I replied, \"I opened the door myself because the room felt stuffy.\"\n\nHe gave me a suspicious look. \"Perhaps we should get down to business, then. Mr. Ferguson and I will take you to look at the machine.\"\n\n\"Should I put on my hat?\"\n\n\"No, the machine is inside the house.\"\n\n\"You process fuller's-earth in the house?\"\n\n\"No, no, we just compress it here. But never mind that. All we need is for you to examine the machine and tell us what's wrong with it.\""

It was a labyrinth of an old house, with corridors, passages, narrow winding staircases, and little low doors, the thresholds of which were hollowed out by the generations who had crossed them. There were no carpets and no signs of any furniture above the ground floor, while the plaster was peeling off the walls, and the damp was breaking through in green, unhealthy blotches. I tried to put on as unconcerned an air as possible, but I had not forgotten the warnings of the lady, even though I disregarded them, and I kept a keen eye upon my two companions. Ferguson appeared to be a morose and silent man, but I could see from the little that he said that he was at least a fellow-countryman.\n“Colonel Lysander Stark stopped at last before a low door, which he unlocked. Within was a small, square room, in which the three of us could hardly get at one time. Ferguson remained outside, and the colonel ushered me in.\n“‘We are now,’ said he, ‘actually within the hydraulic press, and it would be a particularly unpleasant thing for us if anyone were to turn it on. The ceiling of this small chamber is really the end of the descending piston, and it comes down with the force of many tons upon this metal floor. There are small lateral columns of water outside which receive the force, and which transmit and multiply it in the manner which is familiar to you. The machine goes readily enough, but there is some stiffness in the working of it, and it has lost a little of its force. Perhaps you will have the goodness to look it over and to show us how we can set it right.’\n“I took the lamp from him, and I examined the machine very thoroughly. It was indeed a gigantic one, and capable of exercising enormous pressure. When I passed outside, however, and pressed down the levers which controlled it, I knew at once by the whishing sound that there was a slight leakage, which allowed a regurgitation of water through one of the side cylinders. An examination showed that one of the india-rubber bands which was round the head of a driving-rod had shrunk so as not quite to fill the socket along which it worked. This was clearly the cause of the loss of power, and I pointed it out to my companions, who followed my remarks very carefully and asked several practical questions as to how they should proceed to set it right. When I had made it clear to them, I returned to the main chamber of the machine and took a good look at it to satisfy my own curiosity. It was obvious at a glance that the story of the fuller’s-earth was the merest fabrication, for it would be absurd to suppose that so powerful an engine could be designed for so inadequate a purpose. The walls were of wood, but the floor consisted of a large iron trough, and when I came to examine it I could see a crust of metallic deposit all over it. I had stooped and was scraping at this to see exactly what it was when I heard a muttered exclamation in German and saw the cadaverous face of the colonel looking down at me.\n“‘What are you doing there?’ he asked.\n“I felt angry at having been tricked by so elaborate a story as that which he had told me. ‘I was admiring your fuller’s-earth,’ said I; ‘I think that I should be better able to advise you as to your machine if I knew what the exact purpose was for which it was used.’\n“The instant that I uttered the words I regretted the rashness of my speech. His face set hard, and a baleful light sprang up in his grey eyes.\n“‘Very well,’ said he, ‘you shall know all about the machine.’ He took a step backward, slammed the little door, and turned the key in the lock. I rushed towards it and pulled at the handle, but it was quite secure, and did not give in the least to my kicks and shoves.",
          "paraphrase_gemini-2.5-flash-preview-04-17": "We ascended the stairs together, the colonel leading the way with the lamp, followed by the portly manager and myself. The old dwelling was a complex maze of hallways, passages, narrow winding staircases, and small, low doors whose sills were worn hollow by generations of foot traffic. There were no rugs or furniture visible above the ground floor; the plaster was peeling from the walls, and unhealthy-looking green damp patches showed through. I tried to maintain a composed demeanor, but I hadn't forgotten the warnings from the lady, despite having disregarded them outwardly, and I kept a close watch on my two companions. Ferguson seemed like a glum and quiet individual, though I could tell from his few words that he was, at least, from my own country.\nColonel Lysander Stark eventually stopped before a low door and unlocked it. Inside was a small, square room barely large enough for the three of us simultaneously. Ferguson remained outside, and the colonel motioned me to enter.\n'We are now,' he stated, 'actually inside the hydraulic press, and it would be particularly unfortunate for us if it were activated. This small chamber's ceiling is in fact the end of the descending piston, which comes down with the force of many tons onto this metal floor. There are thin vertical water columns outside that absorb the force and transmit and multiply it in a way you are familiar with. The mechanism operates readily enough, but there's some stiffness in its movement, and it has lost some of its power. Perhaps you would kindly examine it and show us how to fix it.'\nI took the lamp from him and carefully inspected the machine. It was indeed colossal and capable of exerting immense pressure. However, when I stepped back outside and depressed the levers that controlled it, the 'whishing' sound immediately indicated a slight leak, which caused water to flow back through one of the side cylinders. Further examination showed that a rubber ring around the head of a driving rod had shrunk, no longer fully fitting the socket it moved within. This was clearly the source of the power loss, and I pointed it out to my companions, who listened closely to my explanations and asked several practical questions about how to proceed with the repair. After I had clarified the steps for them, I returned to the main chamber of the machine for a closer look to satisfy my own curiosity. It was instantly obvious that the story about fuller's earth was pure invention, as it would be absurd to think such a powerful device was designed for such a minor purpose. The walls were made of wood, but the floor was a large iron trough, and upon inspecting it, I saw a coating of metallic residue all over it. I had bent down and was scraping at this substance to determine exactly what it was when I heard a low exclamation in German and saw the colonel's gaunt face looking down at me.\n'What are you doing there?' he demanded.\nI felt irritation at having been deceived by his elaborate tale. 'I was admiring your fuller's earth,' I replied; 'I believe I could offer better advice on your machine if I understood its real purpose.' The moment I spoke, I regretted my impulsive words. His face became rigid, and a sinister gleam appeared in his grey eyes.\n'Very well,' he said, 'you will know everything about the machine.' He stepped back, slammed the small door shut, and locked it with the key. I lunged towards it and pulled at the handle, but it was completely secure and did not give way at all to my kicks and shoves.",

The house was a confusing maze, full of winding corridors, passageways, narrow staircases, and small, low doors whose thresholds had been worn down by countless footsteps over the years. There were no carpets or visible furniture on the upper floors, the walls were peeling, and dampness showed through in green, unhealthy patches. I tried to act calm, despite the lady’s warnings—which I remembered even as I ignored them—and I watched my companions closely. Ferguson was a quiet, sullen man, but from his brief words, I figured he was at least from my own country.\n\nAt last, Colonel Lysander Stark stopped in front of a low door and unlocked it. Inside was a tiny square room, barely big enough for the three of us at once. Ferguson stayed outside, while the colonel led me in.\n\n\"We are now inside the hydraulic press,\" he explained, \"and it would be very dangerous if anyone activated it. The ceiling of this chamber is actually the bottom of a piston which comes down with immense force onto this metal floor. Water columns on the sides absorb and amplify this force as you know. The machine generally works well, but has become a little stiff and isn’t as powerful as it should be. Could you please look it over and tell us how it can be fixed?\"\n\nI took the lamp from him and closely inspected the machine. It was indeed massive, capable of exerting great pressure. After checking from the outside and testing the levers, I could tell from the sound that there was a slight leak allowing water to flow back through one of the side cylinders. Investigation revealed that one of the india-rubber bands around the driving-rod head had shrunk, so it no longer sealed properly, causing the loss in power. I pointed this out to my companions, who listened carefully and asked practical questions about fixing it. Once I’d explained the problem and solution, I returned to the machine’s main chamber for a closer look, curious to examine it further. It was clear to me that the story about fuller’s-earth was a complete lie, as it made no sense to use such a powerful machine for that purpose. The room’s floor was made from a large iron trough, and I noticed a metallic crust covering it. As I bent down to scrape and identify the substance, I heard an exclamation in German and saw the pale face of the colonel peering down at me.\n\n\"What are you doing there?\" he demanded.\n\nAngered by his elaborate deception, I replied, \"I was examining your fuller’s-earth. I think I could give better advice if I knew what your machine was really for.\"\n\nI immediately regretted saying this, as the colonel’s expression turned hard and his eyes flashed with menace.\n\n\"Very well,\" he said, \"I’ll show you the truth about the machine.\" He stepped back, slammed the door shut, and locked it. I rushed to the door and tried to open it, but it was solid and wouldn’t budge despite my efforts."

          "text_segment": "‘Hullo!’ I yelled. ‘Hullo! Colonel! Let me out!’\n“And then suddenly in the silence I heard a sound which sent my heart into my mouth. It was the clank of the levers and the swish of the leaking cylinder. He had set the engine at work. The lamp still stood upon the floor where I had placed it when examining the trough. By its light I saw that the black ceiling was coming down upon me, slowly, jerkily, but, as none knew better than myself, with a force which must within a minute grind me to a shapeless pulp. I threw myself, screaming, against the door, and dragged with my nails at the lock. I implored the colonel to let me out, but the remorseless clanking of the levers drowned my cries. The ceiling was only a foot or two above my head, and with my hand upraised I could feel its hard, rough surface. Then it flashed through my mind that the pain of my death would depend very much upon the position in which I met it. If I lay on my face the weight would come upon my spine, and I shuddered to think of that dreadful snap. Easier the other way, perhaps; and yet, had I the nerve to lie and look up at that deadly black shadow wavering down upon me? Already I was unable to stand erect, when my eye caught something which brought a gush of hope back to my heart.\n“I have said that though the floor and ceiling were of iron, the walls were of wood. As I gave a last hurried glance around, I saw a thin line of yellow light between two of the boards, which broadened and broadened as a small panel was pushed backward. For an instant I could hardly believe that here was indeed a door which led away from death. The next instant I threw myself through, and lay half-fainting upon the other side. The panel had closed again behind me, but the crash of the lamp, and a few moments afterwards the clang of the two slabs of metal, told me how narrow had been my escape.\n“I was recalled to myself by a frantic plucking at my wrist, and I found myself lying upon the stone floor of a narrow corridor, while a woman bent over me and tugged at me with her left hand, while she held a candle in her right. It was the same good friend whose warning I had so foolishly rejected.\n“‘Come! come!’ she cried breathlessly. ‘They will be here in a moment. They will see that you are not there. Oh, do not waste the so-precious time, but come!’\n“This time, at least, I did not scorn her advice. I staggered to my feet and ran with her along the corridor and down a winding stair. The latter led to another broad passage, and just as we reached it we heard the sound of running feet and the shouting of two voices, one answering the other from the floor on which we were and from the one beneath. My guide stopped and looked about her like one who is at her wit’s end. Then she threw open a door which led into a bedroom, through the window of which the moon was shining brightly.\n“‘It is your only chance,’ said she. ‘It is high, but it may be that you can jump it.’\n“As she spoke a light sprang into view at the further end of the passage, and I saw the lean figure of Colonel Lysander Stark rushing forward with a lantern in one hand and a weapon like a butcher’s cleaver in the other. I rushed across the bedroom, flung open the window, and looked out. How quiet and sweet and wholesome the garden looked in the moonlight, and it could not be more than thirty feet down. I clambered out upon the sill, but I hesitated to jump until I should have heard what passed between my saviour and the ruffian who pursued me. If she were ill-used, then at any risks I was determined to go back to her assistance. The thought had hardly flashed through my mind before he was at the door, pushing his way past her; but she threw her arms round him and tried to hold him back.\n“‘Fritz! Fritz!’ she cried in English, ‘remember your promise after the last time. You said it should not be again. He will be silent! Oh, he will be silent!’\n“‘You are mad, Elise!’ he shouted, struggling to break away from her. ‘You will be the ruin of us. He has seen too much. Let me pass, I say!’ He dashed her to one side, and, rushing to the window, cut at me with his heavy weapon. I had let myself go, and was hanging by the hands to the sill, when his blow fell. I was conscious of a dull pain, my grip loosened, and I fell into the garden below.\n“I was shaken but not hurt by the fall; so I picked myself up and rushed off among the bushes as hard as I could run, for I understood that I was far from being out of danger yet. Suddenly, however, as I ran, a deadly dizziness and sickness came over me. I glanced down at my hand, which was throbbing painfully, and then, for the first time, saw that my thumb had been cut off and that the blood was pouring from my wound. I endeavoured to tie my handkerchief round it, but there came a sudden buzzing in my ears, and next moment I fell in a dead faint among the rose-bushes.",
          "paraphrase_gemini-2.5-flash-preview-04-17": "I cried out, ‘Hello! Hello! Colonel! Let me out!’ Suddenly, in the silence that followed, I heard a sound that terrified me: the clanking of levers and the swishing of the cylinder, indicating the engine had been started. The lamp I had used to examine the trough was still on the floor. By its light, I saw the dark ceiling slowly, unevenly descending towards me. I knew better than anyone that its force would crush me into a pulp within a minute. Screaming, I threw myself against the door and desperately clawed at the lock. I pleaded with the Colonel to release me, but the relentless noise of the machinery drowned out my shouts. The ceiling was just a foot or two above my head, and I could feel its hard, rough surface when I reached up. It then occurred to me that the pain of my death would depend greatly on my position. Lying face down meant the weight would hit my spine, and the thought of that breaking snap made me shudder. Perhaps facing upwards would be easier, but could I bear to lie there and watch that dark, deadly shadow coming down? I was already unable to stand upright when my eyes spotted something that brought a surge of hope. I mentioned that while the floor and ceiling were metal, the walls were wooden. In a final quick scan around, I saw a thin line of yellow light between two boards. This line widened as a small panel was pushed open. For a moment, I could scarcely believe this was an actual door leading away from certain death. The next moment, I threw myself through it and lay semi-conscious on the other side. The panel closed behind me, but the crash of the lamp and, shortly after, the bang of the two metal slabs confirmed how narrowly I had escaped. I was brought back to my senses by someone frantically pulling at my wrist. I found myself lying on the stone floor of a narrow passage with a woman leaning over me, tugging my arm with her left hand while holding a candle in her right. It was the same kind friend whose warning I had so foolishly disregarded earlier. ‘Come! Come!’ she urged breathlessly. ‘They’ll be here in a moment. They’ll see you’re not there. Oh, don’t waste this precious time, come!’ This time, at least, I did not ignore her advice. I stumbled to my feet and ran with her along the corridor and down a winding staircase. This stair led to another wide passage. Just as we reached it, we heard the sound of running feet and two voices shouting, one from our level and one from below. My guide stopped and looked around, clearly at her wit's end. Then she quickly opened a door into a bedroom, where moonlight streamed brightly through the window. ‘It’s your only chance,’ she said. ‘It’s high, but perhaps you can jump.’ As she spoke, a light appeared at the far end of the passage, and I saw the lean figure of Colonel Lysander Stark running towards us with a lantern in one hand and a weapon like a butcher’s cleaver in the other. I ran across the bedroom, flung open the window, and looked out. The garden looked so peaceful, sweet, and lovely in the moonlight. It didn't seem more than thirty feet down. I climbed onto the windowsill, but I hesitated to jump, wanting to hear what passed between my rescuer and the villain chasing me. If she was mistreated, I was determined to go back to help her, regardless of the danger. This thought had barely formed before he was at the door, pushing past her. But she threw her arms around him, trying to restrain him. ‘Fritz! Fritz!’ she cried in English, ‘Remember your promise after the last time. You said this wouldn’t happen again. He will be quiet! Oh, he will!’ ‘You’re insane, Elise!’ he yelled, struggling to escape her hold. ‘You will be our ruin. He’s seen too much. Let me pass, I say!’ He violently shoved her aside and, rushing to the window, swung his heavy weapon at me. I had already let go and was hanging by my hands from the sill when his blow landed. I felt a dull pain, my grip failed, and I dropped into the garden below. I was shaken but not injured by the fall. So I got up and ran into the bushes as fast as I could, knowing I was still far from safe. However, as I ran, I was suddenly overcome by intense dizziness and sickness. I looked down at my hand, which was throbbing with pain, and for the first time, saw that my thumb had been cut off and blood was pouring from the wound. I tried to tie my handkerchief around it, but a sudden buzzing sound filled my ears, and the next moment, I fell unconscious among the rose bushes.",

Suddenly, in the silence, I heard a noise that filled me with dread: the sound of machinery starting up—the clank of levers and the hiss of escaping steam. The colonel had activated the engine. The lamp I’d used for examining the trough still sat on the floor, and by its light I could see that the black ceiling above me was slowly descending, jerking as it came down with terrible force. I knew all too well that in less than a minute, it would crush me completely. Desperate, I flung myself at the door, screaming, scrabbling at the lock with my nails, begging the colonel to release me. My pleas were drowned out by the relentless noise of the machine. The ceiling was now barely a foot or two above my head; when I raised my hand, I could touch its rough, hard surface. A sudden thought struck me: the pain of my death would depend on how I positioned myself. If I lay face down, the weight would break my spine—a horrific thought. Lying on my back might be easier, but would I have the courage to stare up as the ceiling crushed me? I was already almost crouched when I caught a faint glimmer of hope: through the iron floor and ceiling, the wooden walls revealed a thin strip of yellow light between two boards. The line of light widened as a hidden panel slid open. At first, I couldn’t believe it meant escape, but then I rushed through the opening, collapsing half-faint on the other side. The panel closed behind me. From within, the crash of the lamp and then the clang of the collapsing metal showed how closely I’d escaped death."

My clothes were all sodden with dew, and my coat-sleeve was drenched with blood from my wounded thumb. The smarting of it recalled in an instant all the particulars of my night’s adventure, and I sprang to my feet with the feeling that I might hardly yet be safe from my pursuers. But to my astonishment, when I came to look round me, neither house nor garden were to be seen. I had been lying in an angle of the hedge close by the high road, and just a little lower down was a long building, which proved, upon my approaching it, to be the very station at which I had arrived upon the previous night. Were it not for the ugly wound upon my hand, all that had passed during those dreadful hours might have been an evil dream.\n“Half dazed, I went into the station and asked about the morning train. There would be one to Reading in less than an hour. The same porter was on duty, I found, as had been there when I arrived. I inquired of him whether he had ever heard of Colonel Lysander Stark. The name was strange to him. Had he observed a carriage the night before waiting for me? No, he had not. Was there a police-station anywhere near? There was one about three miles off.\n“It was too far for me to go, weak and ill as I was. I determined to wait until I got back to town before telling my story to the police. It was a little past six when I arrived, so I went first to have my wound dressed, and then the doctor was kind enough to bring me along here. I put the case into your hands and shall do exactly what you advise.”\nWe both sat in silence for some little time after listening to this extraordinary narrative. Then Sherlock Holmes pulled down from the shelf one of the ponderous commonplace books in which he placed his cuttings.\n“Here is an advertisement which will interest you,” said he. “It appeared in all the papers about a year ago. Listen to this: ‘Lost, on the 9th inst., Mr. Jeremiah Hayling, aged twenty-six, a hydraulic engineer. Left his lodgings at ten o’clock at night, and has not been heard of since. Was dressed in,’ etc., etc. Ha! That represents the last time that the colonel needed to have his machine overhauled, I fancy.”\n“Good heavens!” cried my patient. “Then that explains what the girl said.”\n“Undoubtedly. It is quite clear that the colonel was a cool and desperate man, who was absolutely determined that nothing should stand in the way of his little game, like those out-and-out pirates who will leave no survivor from a captured ship.",

It must have been a significant amount of time, as the moon had gone down, and daylight was breaking when I regained consciousness. My clothes were completely soaked with dew, and blood from my injured thumb had saturated my coat-sleeve. The stinging pain immediately reminded me of every detail of my night's adventure, and I quickly stood up, feeling that I might still be in danger from those pursuing me. However, to my surprise, when I looked around, neither the house nor the garden was visible. I had been lying in a corner of the hedge right by the main road, and just a short distance further down was a long building. When I approached it, I realized it was the exact station where I had arrived the previous night. Were it not for the nasty cut on my hand, everything that occurred during those dreadful hours might have seemed like a bad dream.\n\nStill feeling somewhat stunned, I entered the station and asked about the morning train. There would be one going to Reading within the hour. I noticed that the same porter was on duty as when I had arrived. I asked him if he had ever heard of Colonel Lysander Stark. The name was unfamiliar to him. I asked if he had seen a carriage waiting for me the night before. He said he had not. Was there a police station anywhere close by? He informed me there was one about three miles away.\n\nThat was too far for me to go in my weak and ill state. I decided to wait until I was back in London before reporting my story to the police. It was a little after six when I arrived back in town, so I first went to get my wound attended to. Then, the doctor was kind enough to bring me here. I am now putting this case into your hands and will follow your exact advice.\n\nWe both sat in silence for a short while after hearing this remarkable story. Then Sherlock Holmes took down one of the heavy reference books where he kept his clippings from the shelf.\n\n“Here is an advertisement that will be of interest to you,” he said. “It appeared in all the newspapers about a year ago. Listen to this: ‘Missing, on the 9th instant, Mr. Jeremiah Hayling, aged twenty-six, a hydraulic engineer. Left his lodgings at ten o’clock at night, and has not been heard from since.

I suspect that represents the last time the colonel needed his machine serviced.”\n\n“Good heavens!” exclaimed my patient. “Then that explains what the girl said.”\n\n“Exactly,” Holmes confirmed. “It is quite clear that the colonel was a cold and ruthless man, who was absolutely determined that nothing should prevent his little scheme, like those utter pirates who leave no survivors from a captured ship.",

To my surprise, when I looked around, there was no sign of the house or garden. I had apparently been lying up against a hedge near the main road, and a bit further down was a long building, which, as I got closer, turned out to be the very train station where I had arrived the night before. If not for the nasty wound on my hand, I might have thought the nightmare I had undergone was only a bad dream.\n\nFeeling groggy, I went into the station and asked when the next train left. There was one to Reading leaving in under an hour. The same porter who had greeted me upon my arrival was there, and I asked him if he had ever heard of Colonel Lysander Stark. He said the name meant nothing to him. I also asked if he had seen any carriage waiting for me the previous night, but he answered no. I checked if there was a police station nearby, and he said there was one about three miles away.\n\nAs I was too weak and ill to walk that far, I decided I would wait until I reached the city to report my story to the police. After arriving a little after six, I had my wound treated, and the doctor kindly brought me here to you. I am now leaving the matter in your hands and will follow your advice.\n\nAfter hearing this remarkable account, we sat quietly for a while.

There were Sherlock Holmes, the hydraulic engineer, Inspector Bradstreet, of Scotland Yard, a plain-clothes man, and myself. Bradstreet had spread an ordnance map of the county out upon the seat and was busy with his compasses drawing a circle with Eyford for its centre.\n“There you are,” said he. “That circle is drawn at a radius of ten miles from the village. The place we want must be somewhere near that line. You said ten miles, I think, sir.”\n“It was an hour’s good drive.”\n“And you think that they brought you back all that way when you were unconscious?”\n“They must have done so. I have a confused memory, too, of having been lifted and conveyed somewhere.”\n“What I cannot understand,” said I, “is why they should have spared you when they found you lying fainting in the garden. Perhaps the villain was softened by the woman’s entreaties.”\n“I hardly think that likely. I never saw a more inexorable face in my life.”\n“Oh, we shall soon clear up all that,” said Bradstreet. “Well, I have drawn my circle, and I only wish I knew at what point upon it the folk that we are in search of are to be found.”\n“I think I could lay my finger on it,” said Holmes quietly.\n“Really, now!” cried the inspector, “you have formed your opinion! Come, now, we shall see who agrees with you. I say it is south, for the country is more deserted there.”\n“And I say east,” said my patient.\n“I am for west,” remarked the plain-clothes man. “There are several quiet little villages up there.”\n“And I am for north,” said I, “because there are no hills there, and our friend says that he did not notice the carriage go up any.”\n“Come,” cried the inspector, laughing; “it’s a very pretty diversity of opinion. We have boxed the compass among us. Who do you give your casting vote to?”\n“You are all wrong.”\n“But we can’t all be.”\n“Oh, yes, you can. This is my point.” He placed his finger in the centre of the circle. “This is where we shall find them.”\n“But the twelve-mile drive?” gasped Hatherley.\n“Six out and six back. Nothing simpler. You say yourself that the horse was fresh and glossy when you got in. How could it be that if it had gone twelve miles over heavy roads?”\n“Indeed, it is a likely ruse enough,” observed Bradstreet thoughtfully. “Of course there can be no doubt as to the nature of this gang.”\n“None at all,” said Holmes. “They are coiners on a large scale, and have used the machine to form the amalgam which has taken the place of silver.”\n“We have known for some time that a clever gang was at work,” said the inspector. “They have been turning out half-crowns by the thousand. We even traced them as far as Reading, but could get no farther, for they had covered their traces in a way that showed that they were very old hands. But now, thanks to this lucky chance, I think that we have got them right enough.”",
          "paraphrase_gemini-2.5-flash-preview-04-17": "With time being critical, Holmes suggested that if I felt up to it, we should immediately head to Scotland Yard as a preliminary step before traveling to Eyford. Around three hours later, we were all together on a train from Reading, en route to the small village in Berkshire. Our group consisted of Sherlock Holmes, the hydraulic engineer, Inspector Bradstreet of Scotland Yard, a detective in plain clothes, and myself. Bradstreet had spread a county map across the seat and was using his compass to draw a circle with Eyford at its center. \"There it is,\" he announced. \"That circle has a radius of ten miles from the village. The place we're looking for should be somewhere near that line. You estimated ten miles, I believe, sir?\" \"It was a good hour's drive.\" \"And you think they transported you all that distance while you were unconscious?\" \"They must have. I also have a hazy recollection of being lifted and carried somewhere.\" \"What puzzles me,\" I interjected, \"is why they spared you when they found you collapsed in the garden. Perhaps the woman's pleas softened the villain?\" \"I doubt that's likely. I've never seen a more merciless face in my life.\" \"Oh, we'll clear all that up soon enough,\" said Bradstreet. \"Well, I've drawn my circle; now I just wish I knew exactly where on it we'd find the people we're searching for.\" \"I believe I could pinpoint the location,\" Holmes said calmly. \"Indeed!\" exclaimed the inspector, surprised. \"You've formed a conclusion! Let's see who agrees with you. I say it's south, because the countryside is more isolated there.\" \"And I say east,\" offered my patient. \"I'm for west,\" the plain-clothes detective remarked. \"There are several quiet small villages in that direction.\" \"And I'm for north,\" I stated, \"since there are no hills there, and our friend mentioned he didn't notice the carriage ascending any.\" \"Come now,\" the inspector laughed, \"what a diverse set of opinions! We've covered all directions. To whom do you give your deciding vote?\" \"You are all incorrect.\" \"But we can't possibly all be wrong.\" \"Oh, yes, you can. My location is here.\" He placed his finger directly on the center of the circle. \"This is where we will find them.\" \"But what about the twelve-mile drive?\" Hatherley gasped. \"Six miles out and six miles back. Nothing could be simpler. You yourself said the horse was fresh and shiny when you got in. How could that be if it had traveled twelve miles over difficult roads?\" \"Indeed, that's quite a plausible deception,\" Bradstreet mused thoughtfully. \"Of course, there can be no question about the nature of this criminal group.\" \"Absolutely none,\" Holmes affirmed. \"They are large-scale coiners, and they used the machine to create the alloy that replaced silver.\" \"We've known for some time that a skilled gang was operating,\" the inspector added. \"They've been producing thousands of counterfeit half-crowns. We even tracked them as far as Reading but couldn't proceed further, as they had hidden their tracks in a way that showed they were very experienced operators.

I vaguely remember being carried somewhere.\"\n\nI expressed my puzzlement as to why they hadn't harmed him when they found him fainting in the garden.

Early that morning a peasant had met a cart containing several people and some very bulky boxes driving rapidly in the direction of Reading, but there all traces of the fugitives disappeared, and even Holmes’ ingenuity failed ever to discover the least clue as to their whereabouts.\nThe firemen had been much perturbed at the strange arrangements which they had found within, and still more so by discovering a newly severed human thumb upon a window-sill of the second floor. About sunset, however, their efforts were at last successful, and they subdued the flames, but not before the roof had fallen in, and the whole place been reduced to such absolute ruin that, save some twisted cylinders and iron piping, not a trace remained of the machinery which had cost our unfortunate acquaintance so dearly. Large masses of nickel and of tin were discovered stored in an out-house, but no coins were to be found, which may have explained the presence of those bulky boxes which have been already referred to.\nHow our hydraulic engineer had been conveyed from the garden to the spot where he recovered his senses might have remained forever a mystery were it not for the soft mould, which told us a very plain tale. He had evidently been carried down by two persons, one of whom had remarkably small feet and the other unusually large ones. On the whole, it was most probable that the silent Englishman, being less bold or less murderous than his companion, had assisted the woman to bear the unconscious man out of the way of danger.\n“Well,” said our engineer ruefully as we took our seats to return once more to London, “it has been a pretty business for me! I have lost my thumb and I have lost a fifty-guinea fee, and what have I gained?”\n“Experience,” said Holmes, laughing. “Indirectly it may be of value, you know; you have only to put it into words to gain the reputation of being excellent company for the remainder of your existence.”",

Early that morning, a farmer had seen a cart carrying several people and some large containers moving quickly towards Reading, but after that, the trail of those escaping vanished completely, and even Holmes's cleverness could not uncover any hint of where they had gone. The firefighters were quite disturbed by the strange setup they found inside the house and even more so by finding a freshly cut human thumb on a window ledge on the second floor. By sunset, however, their efforts succeeded, and they put out the fire, though not before the roof collapsed and the entire structure was so badly damaged that, apart from some twisted metal cylinders and pipes, no sign remained of the machinery that had cost our unfortunate acquaintance so much. Large quantities of nickel and tin were discovered stored in an outside building, but no money was found, which might account for the large boxes previously mentioned. How our hydraulic engineer was moved from the garden to the place where he regained consciousness would have remained a permanent mystery were it not for the soft ground, which clearly showed what happened. He had clearly been carried by two people, one with unusually small feet and the other with unusually large ones. It was generally most likely that the quiet Englishman, being less daring or less inclined to violence than his companion, had helped the woman move the unconscious man out of harm's way. \"Well,\" said our engineer mournfully as we got into our seats to travel back to London, \"this has been quite an ordeal for me! I've lost my thumb and a fifty-guinea payment, and what have I gained?\" \"Experience,\" said Holmes, laughing. \"Indirectly, that might be useful, you know; just describe it, and you'll gain a reputation for being excellent company for the rest of your life.\"",

A peasant had seen a cart early that morning, filled with several people and large boxes, speeding towards Reading, but after that, the trail of the runaways vanished completely. Not even Holmes could find the slightest clue to their whereabouts.\n\nThe firefighters were disturbed by the strange things they found inside the house and were even more unsettled when they discovered a freshly severed human thumb on a second-floor windowsill. By sunset, they finally put out the blaze, though not before the roof had collapsed and the building was destroyed so thoroughly that, apart from some twisted pieces of metal and pipes, there was nothing left of the machinery that had cost our friend so much. Although large quantities of nickel and tin were found in an outbuilding, there was no trace of any coins—which might be explained by the presence of the large boxes seen earlier.\n\nThe mystery of how our hydraulic engineer ended up where he regained consciousness would have remained unsolved, if not for the soft earth, which told its own story. He had clearly been carried by two people: one with very small feet, the other with very large ones. It seemed most likely that the taciturn Englishman, perhaps less daring or violent than his associate, had helped the woman carry the unconscious man to safety.\n\nAs we prepared to return to London, our engineer lamented, “This adventure hasn’t done me much good! I’ve lost my thumb and missed out on a fifty-guinea payment. And what have I gained?”\n\n“Experience,” Holmes replied, laughing. “And that, if you tell the story right, could give you a reputation for being excellent company for the rest of your days.”"

Fresh scandals have eclipsed it, and their more piquant details have drawn the gossips away from this four-year-old drama. As I have reason to believe, however, that the full facts have never been revealed to the general public, and as my friend Sherlock Holmes had a considerable share in clearing the matter up, I feel that no memoir of him would be complete without some little sketch of this remarkable episode.\nIt was a few weeks before my own marriage, during the days when I was still sharing rooms with Holmes in Baker Street, that he came home from an afternoon stroll to find a letter on the table waiting for him. I had remained indoors all day, for the weather had taken a sudden turn to rain, with high autumnal winds, and the jezail bullet which I had brought back in one of my limbs as a relic of my Afghan campaign throbbed with dull persistence. With my body in one easy-chair and my legs upon another, I had surrounded myself with a cloud of newspapers until at last, saturated with the news of the day, I tossed them all aside and lay listless, watching the huge crest and monogram upon the envelope upon the table and wondering lazily who my friend’s noble correspondent could be.\n“Here is a very fashionable epistle,” I remarked as he entered. “Your morning letters, if I remember right, were from a fish-monger and a tide-waiter.”\n“Yes, my correspondence has certainly the charm of variety,” he answered, smiling, “and the humbler are usually the more interesting. This looks like one of those unwelcome social summonses which call upon a man either to be bored or to lie.”\nHe broke the seal and glanced over the contents.\n“Oh, come, it may prove to be something of interest, after all.”\n“Not social, then?”\n“No, distinctly professional.”\n“And from a noble client?”\n“One of the highest in England.”\n“My dear fellow, I congratulate you.”\n“I assure you, Watson, without affectation, that the status of my client is a matter of less moment to me than the interest of his case. It is just possible, however, that that also may not be wanting in this new investigation. You have been reading the papers diligently of late, have you not?”\n“It looks like it,” said I ruefully, pointing to a huge bundle in the corner. “I have had nothing else to do.”\n“It is fortunate, for you will perhaps be able to post me up. I read nothing except the criminal news and the agony column. The latter is always instructive. But if you have followed recent events so closely you must have read about Lord St. Simon and his wedding?”\n“Oh, yes, with the deepest interest.”",

Newer scandals have overshadowed it, their more sensational details diverting gossip away from this event that occurred four years ago. However, because I believe the complete facts of the case have never been disclosed to the general public, and since my friend Sherlock Holmes played a considerable part in resolving the matter, I feel that no account of his life would be complete without including a brief description of this remarkable incident.\n\nIt was just a few weeks before my own wedding, during the period when I was still sharing lodgings with Holmes on Baker Street, that he returned from an afternoon walk to find a letter addressed to him lying on the table. I had stayed indoors all day because the weather had suddenly turned bad, with heavy rain and strong autumn winds, and the old jezail bullet lodged in one of my limbs as a memento from my campaign in Afghanistan was throbbing with persistent, dull pain. Relaxing with my body in one easy chair and my legs propped on another, I had surrounded myself with piles of newspapers until, thoroughly absorbed in the day's news, I finally tossed them aside and lay there listlessly, gazing at the large crest and monogram on the envelope on the table and idly wondering who my friend's aristocratic correspondent might be.\n\n\"This is a very elegant letter,\" I commented as he entered. \"Your mail this morning, if I recall correctly, was from a fishmonger and a customs inspector.\"\n\n\"Yes, my correspondence certainly has a diverse range,\" he replied with a smile, \"and the more ordinary ones are usually more interesting. This looks like one of those unwelcome formal invitations that force a man to either be bored or tell a lie.\"\n\nHe broke the seal and quickly read the contents.\n\n\"Oh, well, it might turn out to be something interesting after all.\"\n\n\"So, not a social engagement?\"\n\n\"No, clearly professional.\"\n\n\"And from a client of noble status?\"\n\n\"One of the highest-ranking in England.\"\n\n\"My dear fellow, congratulations.\"\n\n\"I assure you, Watson,\" he said sincerely, \"the position of my client is less important to me than the appeal of his case. However, it's quite possible that this new investigation will not lack interest either. You've been reading the newspapers attentively lately, haven't you?\"\n\n\"It appears so,\" I said wryly, pointing to a large stack in the corner. \"I haven't had anything else to do.\"\n\n\"That's fortunate, because you might be able to update me. I only read the crime reports and the personal ads section. The latter is always enlightening. But if you've been keeping up with recent events so closely, you must have read about Lord St. Simon and his wedding?\"\n\n\"Oh, yes, with the utmost interest.\"",

Newer scandals with juicier details have pushed this four-year-old event out of the conversation. However, I believe that the full story of what happened has never been shared with the general public, and since my friend Sherlock Holmes played an important part in resolving the incident, I consider it necessary to include a short account of this extraordinary case in any memoir about him. It was some weeks before my own marriage, while I was still living with Holmes at Baker Street, that he returned from a walk one rainy and windy afternoon to find a letter waiting for him. I had stayed inside all day because the weather agitated an old war wound from Afghanistan, causing me pain. Reclining in a chair and surrounded by newspapers, I eventually put them aside and, feeling bored, gazed at the impressive envelope lying on the table, wondering idly who this aristocratic correspondent might be. When Holmes entered, I commented, \"There's quite a fancy letter here for you. Earlier, you only had mail from a fish seller and a customs officer.\" Holmes responded, joking that the range of his correspondence was certainly interesting, and that he usually found the less prestigious ones to be more worthwhile. He observed that the letter seemed to be an unwelcome social invitation that would force him either to be bored or dishonest, but upon reading it, he realized it might actually be of genuine interest. I asked if it was social; he replied that it was truly professional, and indicated that it came from a very high-ranking person in England, which I congratulated him for. Holmes, however, insisted that the client's social rank was less important than the case itself, though this particular case promised interest on both counts. He then asked if I had been keeping up with the news, which I confirmed, since I had little else to do. Holmes said that was good, since he rarely read anything outside of the criminal reports and personal advertisements, and he asked if I knew about Lord St. Simon's wedding. I replied that I had been following it with great interest."

SHERLOCK HOLMES,—Lord Backwater tells me that I may place implicit reliance upon your judgment and discretion. I have determined, therefore, to call upon you and to consult you in reference to the very painful event which has occurred in connection with my wedding. Mr. Lestrade, of Scotland Yard, is acting already in the matter, but he assures me that he sees no objection to your co-operation, and that he even thinks that it might be of some assistance. I will call at four o’clock in the afternoon, and, should you have any other engagement at that time, I hope that you will postpone it, as this matter is of paramount importance. Yours faithfully,\n“‘ROBERT ST. SIMON.’\n“It is dated from Grosvenor Mansions, written with a quill pen, and the noble lord has had the misfortune to get a smear of ink upon the outer side of his right little finger,” remarked Holmes as he folded up the epistle.\n“He says four o’clock. It is three now. He will be here in an hour.”\n“Then I have just time, with your assistance, to get clear upon the subject. Turn over those papers and arrange the extracts in their order of time, while I take a glance as to who our client is.” He picked a red-covered volume from a line of books of reference beside the mantelpiece. “Here he is,” said he, sitting down and flattening it out upon his knee. “‘Lord Robert Walsingham de Vere St. Simon, second son of the Duke of Balmoral.’ Hum! ‘Arms: Azure, three caltrops in chief over a fess sable. Born in 1846.’ He’s forty-one years of age, which is mature for marriage. Was Under-Secretary for the colonies in a late administration. The Duke, his father, was at one time Secretary for Foreign Affairs. They inherit Plantagenet blood by direct descent, and Tudor on the distaff side. Ha! Well, there is nothing very instructive in all this. I think that I must turn to you Watson, for something more solid.”\n“I have very little difficulty in finding what I want,” said I, “for the facts are quite recent, and the matter struck me as remarkable. I feared to refer them to you, however, as I knew that you had an inquiry on hand and that you disliked the intrusion of other matters.”\n“Oh, you mean the little problem of the Grosvenor Square furniture van. That is quite cleared up now—though, indeed, it was obvious from the first. Pray give me the results of your newspaper selections.”\n“Here is the first notice which I can find. It is in the personal column of the Morning Post, and dates, as you see, some weeks back: ‘A marriage has been arranged,’ it says, ‘and will, if rumour is correct, very shortly take place, between Lord Robert St. Simon, second son of the Duke of Balmoral, and Miss Hatty Doran, the only daughter of Aloysius Doran. Esq., of San Francisco, Cal., U.S.A.’ That is all.”\n“Terse and to the point,” remarked Holmes, stretching his long, thin legs towards the fire.\n“There was a paragraph amplifying this in one of the society papers of the same week. Ah, here it is: ‘There will soon be a call for protection in the marriage market, for the present free-trade principle appears to tell heavily against our home product. One by one the management of the noble houses of Great Britain is passing into the hands of our fair cousins from across the Atlantic. An important addition has been made during the last week to the list of the prizes which have been borne away by these charming invaders. Lord St. Simon, who has shown himself for over twenty years proof against the little god’s arrows, has now definitely announced his approaching marriage with Miss Hatty Doran, the fascinating daughter of a California millionaire. Miss Doran, whose graceful figure and striking face attracted much attention at the Westbury House festivities, is an only child, and it is currently reported that her dowry will run to considerably over the six figures, with expectancies for the future. As it is an open secret that the Duke of Balmoral has been compelled to sell his pictures within the last few years, and as Lord St. Simon has no property of his own save the small estate of Birchmoor, it is obvious that the Californian heiress is not the only gainer by an alliance which will enable her to make the easy and common transition from a Republican lady to a British peeress.’”\n“Anything else?” asked Holmes, yawning.\n“Oh, yes; plenty. Then there is another note in the Morning Post to say that the marriage would be an absolutely quiet one, that it would be at St. George’s, Hanover Square, that only half a dozen intimate friends would be invited, and that the party would return to the furnished house at Lancaster Gate which has been taken by Mr. Aloysius Doran. Two days later—that is, on Wednesday last—there is a curt announcement that the wedding had taken place, and that the honeymoon would be passed at Lord Backwater’s place, near Petersfield. Those are all the notices which appeared before the disappearance of the bride.”\n“Before the what?” asked Holmes with a start.\n“The vanishing of the lady.”\n“When did she vanish, then?”\n“At the wedding breakfast.”\n“Indeed. This is more interesting than it promised to be; quite dramatic, in fact.”\n“Yes; it struck me as being a little out of the common.”\n“They often vanish before the ceremony, and occasionally during the honeymoon; but I cannot call to mind anything quite so prompt as this. Pray let me have the details.”",
          "paraphrase_gemini-2.5-flash-preview-04-17": "“Excellent,” Holmes said. “The letter I’m holding is from Lord St. Simon.

SHERLOCK HOLMES,—Lord Backwater assures me I can completely trust your judgment and discretion. Therefore, I have decided to reach out to you and consult you regarding the very distressing event connected to my wedding. Mr. Lestrade of Scotland Yard is already handling the case, but he has no objection to your involvement and even believes it might be helpful. I will visit at four o’clock this afternoon. If you have other plans at that time, I hope you can reschedule them, as this issue is extremely important. Yours faithfully, ROBERT ST. SIMON.’” Holmes folded the letter, observing, “It’s dated from Grosvenor Mansions, written with a quill pen, and the noble lord unfortunately smeared ink on the outside of his right little finger.” “He says four o’clock. It is currently three. He’ll arrive in an hour.” “Then, with your help, we have just enough time to get informed about the case,” Holmes replied. “Please look through those papers and arrange the excerpts chronologically while I quickly check who our client is.” He took a red-covered reference book from a shelf by the fireplace. “Here he is,” he announced, sitting down and opening the book on his lap. “‘Lord Robert Walsingham de Vere St. Simon, second son of the Duke of Balmoral.’ Hmm. ‘Coat of Arms: Azure, three caltrops at the top over a black horizontal band. Born in 1846.’ He’s forty-one years old, which is a mature age for marriage. He served as Under-Secretary for the colonies in a recent government. His father, the Duke, was once Secretary for Foreign Affairs. They have a direct lineage from the Plantagenets and Tudor ancestry through the female line. Ha! Well, none of this is particularly informative. I think I'll have to rely on you, Watson, for something more substantial.” I responded, “I had very little trouble finding what I needed, as the facts are quite recent and struck me as unusual. However, I hesitated to mention them to you, knowing you were busy with another investigation and disliked being interrupted by new matters.” “Oh, you mean the minor issue with the Grosvenor Square furniture van? That’s completely resolved now—though, honestly, it was straightforward from the start. Please share the results of your newspaper search.” “Here is the first notice I found. It’s in the personal column of the Morning Post and, as you can see, dates back a few weeks: ‘A marriage has been arranged,’ it states, ‘and according to rumour, will happen very soon, between Lord Robert St. Simon, second son of the Duke of Balmoral, and Miss Hatty Doran, the only daughter of Aloysius Doran, Esq., of San Francisco, California, U.S.A.’ That’s everything in that one.” “Concise and relevant,” remarked Holmes, extending his long, thin legs towards the fire. “There was a paragraph expanding on this in one of the society papers the same week. Ah, here it is: ‘Soon there will be a need for protectionism in the marriage market, as the current free-trade approach seems to heavily disadvantage our local product. One by one, control of Great Britain’s noble houses is shifting into the hands of our attractive cousins from across the Atlantic. An important addition was made last week to the list of prizes claimed by these charming invaders. Lord St. Simon, who has apparently resisted Cupid’s arrows for over twenty years, has now formally announced his upcoming marriage to Miss Hatty Doran, the captivating daughter of a California millionaire. Miss Doran, whose elegant figure and striking appearance attracted considerable attention at the Westbury House celebrations, is an only child, and it is widely reported that her dowry will exceed six figures, with future expectations. As it is an open secret that the Duke of Balmoral has had to sell his artwork in recent years, and Lord St. Simon possesses no property of his own except the small Birchmoor estate, it is clear that the Californian heiress is not the sole beneficiary of an alliance that will facilitate her easy and common transition from an American Republican lady to a British peeress.’” “Anything else?” Holmes asked, yawning. “Oh, yes, plenty more. Then there’s another note in the Morning Post stating the wedding would be extremely private, held at St. George’s, Hanover Square, with only about six close friends invited, and that the group would return to the furnished house at Lancaster Gate that Mr. Aloysius Doran had rented. Two days later—which was last Wednesday—there’s a brief announcement that the wedding had taken place and the honeymoon would be spent at Lord Backwater’s estate near Petersfield. Those are all the notices that appeared before the bride disappeared.” “Before the what?” Holmes asked, startled. “The lady’s vanishing act.” “When did she disappear, then?” “At the wedding breakfast.” “Indeed. This is turning out to be more intriguing than anticipated; quite dramatic, actually.” “Yes, it struck me as rather out of the ordinary.” “They often disappear before the ceremony, and occasionally during the honeymoon, but I can’t recall anything quite as swift as this. Please, provide me with the specific details.”",

A noteworthy addition has just been made to the list of prizes secured by these charming invaders. Lord St. Simon, who for over 20 years seemed immune to Cupid, has just announced his engagement to Miss Hatty Doran, the fascinating daughter of a California millionaire. Miss Doran, whose elegant figure and striking looks were much noticed at the Westbury House parties, is an only child, and is said to have a dowry well above six figures, with future inheritances expected as well. Since it’s no secret that the Duke of Balmoral was forced to sell his art in recent years, and that Lord St. Simon owns nothing but the modest Birchmoor estate, it’s clear that both parties benefit: the Californian heiress gains a title, and the family secures financial stability.’\n\n‘Anything else?’ Holmes asked, stifling a yawn.\n\n‘Yes—plenty. Another Morning Post note says the wedding would be very quiet, held at St. George’s, Hanover Square, with only a few close friends present, and that the party would return to a furnished house at Lancaster Gate rented by Mr. Aloysius Doran. Two days later—last Wednesday—there’s a brief announcement that the wedding had occurred, and that the honeymoon would take place at Lord Backwater’s estate near Petersfield. That’s everything published before the bride disappeared.’\n\n‘Before she what?’ Holmes asked, surprised.\n\n‘Before the lady vanished.’\n\n‘When did she disappear?’\n\n‘At the wedding breakfast.’\n\n‘Indeed, this is more interesting than it first seemed—quite dramatic.’\n\n‘Yes, I thought it was unusual.’\n\n‘Brides may run off before the ceremony, and sometimes during the honeymoon, but I can’t recall any vanishing quite so soon as this. Please, give me all the details.’\"} The end.  (This is a complete paraphrase of the passage.)"

It is headed, ‘Singular Occurrence at a Fashionable Wedding’:\n“‘The family of Lord Robert St. Simon has been thrown into the greatest consternation by the strange and painful episodes which have taken place in connection with his wedding. The ceremony, as shortly announced in the papers of yesterday, occurred on the previous morning; but it is only now that it has been possible to confirm the strange rumours which have been so persistently floating about. In spite of the attempts of the friends to hush the matter up, so much public attention has now been drawn to it that no good purpose can be served by affecting to disregard what is a common subject for conversation.\n“‘The ceremony, which was performed at St. George’s, Hanover Square, was a very quiet one, no one being present save the father of the bride, Mr. Aloysius Doran, the Duchess of Balmoral, Lord Backwater, Lord Eustace and Lady Clara St. Simon (the younger brother and sister of the bridegroom), and Lady Alicia Whittington. The whole party proceeded afterwards to the house of Mr. Aloysius Doran, at Lancaster Gate, where breakfast had been prepared. It appears that some little trouble was caused by a woman, whose name has not been ascertained, who endeavoured to force her way into the house after the bridal party, alleging that she had some claim upon Lord St. Simon. It was only after a painful and prolonged scene that she was ejected by the butler and the footman. The bride, who had fortunately entered the house before this unpleasant interruption, had sat down to breakfast with the rest, when she complained of a sudden indisposition and retired to her room. Her prolonged absence having caused some comment, her father followed her, but learned from her maid that she had only come up to her chamber for an instant, caught up an ulster and bonnet, and hurried down to the passage. One of the footmen declared that he had seen a lady leave the house thus apparelled, but had refused to credit that it was his mistress, believing her to be with the company. On ascertaining that his daughter had disappeared, Mr. Aloysius Doran, in conjunction with the bridegroom, instantly put themselves in communication with the police, and very energetic inquiries are being made, which will probably result in a speedy clearing up of this very singular business. Up to a late hour last night, however, nothing had transpired as to the whereabouts of the missing lady. There are rumours of foul play in the matter, and it is said that the police have caused the arrest of the woman who had caused the original disturbance, in the belief that, from jealousy or some other motive, she may have been concerned in the strange disappearance of the bride.’”\n“And is that all?”\n“Only one little item in another of the morning papers, but it is a suggestive one.”\n“And it is—”\n“That Miss Flora Millar, the lady who had caused the disturbance, has actually been arrested. It appears that she was formerly a danseuse at the Allegro, and that she has known the bridegroom for some years. There are no further particulars, and the whole case is in your hands now—so far as it has been set forth in the public press.”\n“And an exceedingly interesting case it appears to be.",
          "paraphrase_gemini-2.5-flash-preview-04-17": "I must caution you that the details I have are quite limited. Perhaps we can manage to gather more information. What I have comes from a single newspaper article printed yesterday morning, which I will read to you. The headline is: 'Peculiar Incident at a Society Wedding'. The report states: 'Lord Robert St. Simon's family has been greatly distressed by the strange and upsetting occurrences connected with his wedding. The ceremony, as briefly mentioned in yesterday's papers, took place the morning before; however, it is only now that the persistent, strange rumors circulating have been confirmed. Despite friends' efforts to keep the matter quiet, it has attracted so much public attention that pretending to ignore this widely discussed topic would serve no purpose. The wedding, a very private affair held at St. George’s, Hanover Square, was attended only by the bride's father, Mr. Aloysius Doran, the Duchess of Balmoral, Lord Backwater, Lord Eustace and Lady Clara St. Simon (the groom's younger brother and sister), and Lady Alicia Whittington. The entire party then went to Mr. Aloysius Doran's house at Lancaster Gate for the wedding breakfast. It seems a minor disturbance occurred when an unidentified woman tried to force her way into the house after the wedding group, claiming she had a connection to Lord St. Simon. She was removed by the butler and footman only after a difficult and prolonged scene. The bride, who fortunately entered before this unpleasantness, had joined the breakfast but suddenly felt unwell and retired to her room. When she remained away for some time, causing concern, her father went to check on her. Her maid informed him that she had only briefly entered her room, quickly grabbed an overcoat and hat, and rushed back downstairs. A footman reported seeing a lady leaving the house dressed in that manner but did not believe it was his mistress, thinking she was still with the guests. Upon learning his daughter had vanished, Mr. Aloysius Doran, along with the groom, immediately contacted the police. A vigorous investigation is now underway, which is expected to quickly clarify this very unusual situation. However, as of late last night, the missing lady's whereabouts remain unknown. There are rumors of foul play, and it is said the police have arrested the woman who caused the initial disturbance, suspecting she may be involved in the bride's strange disappearance, possibly due to jealousy or another motive.' So, is that all you have? There's just one more small detail from another morning paper, but it's quite revealing. And what is it? That the woman who caused the disturbance, identified as Miss Flora Millar, has indeed been arrested. Apparently, she was formerly a dancer at the Allegro theatre and has known the groom for several years. There are no further details available from the press, so based on what has been publicly reported, the entire matter is now in your hands. And it certainly appears to be an exceptionally interesting case.",

The ceremony, briefly reported earlier, took place the previous morning; but only now have the persistent rumors circulating about it been substantiated.

Thankfully, the bride was already inside and soon joined the breakfast, but she soon felt unwell and went to her room.

Do not dream of going, Watson, for I very much prefer having a witness, if only as a check to my own memory.”\n“Lord Robert St. Simon,” announced our page-boy, throwing open the door. A gentleman entered, with a pleasant, cultured face, high-nosed and pale, with something perhaps of petulance about the mouth, and with the steady, well-opened eye of a man whose pleasant lot it had ever been to command and to be obeyed. His manner was brisk, and yet his general appearance gave an undue impression of age, for he had a slight forward stoop and a little bend of the knees as he walked. His hair, too, as he swept off his very curly-brimmed hat, was grizzled round the edges and thin upon the top. As to his dress, it was careful to the verge of foppishness, with high collar, black frock-coat, white waistcoat, yellow gloves, patent-leather shoes, and light-coloured gaiters. He advanced slowly into the room, turning his head from left to right, and swinging in his right hand the cord which held his golden eyeglasses.\n“Good-day, Lord St. Simon,” said Holmes, rising and bowing. “Pray take the basket-chair. This is my friend and colleague, Dr. Watson. Draw up a little to the fire, and we will talk this matter over.”\n“A most painful matter to me, as you can most readily imagine, Mr. Holmes. I have been cut to the quick. I understand that you have already managed several delicate cases of this sort, sir, though I presume that they were hardly from the same class of society.”\n“No, I am descending.”\n“I beg pardon.”\n“My last client of the sort was a king.”\n“Oh, really! I had no idea. And which king?”\n“The King of Scandinavia.”\n“What! Had he lost his wife?”\n“You can understand,” said Holmes suavely, “that I extend to the affairs of my other clients the same secrecy which I promise to you in yours.”\n“Of course! Very right! very right! I’m sure I beg pardon. As to my own case, I am ready to give you any information which may assist you in forming an opinion.”\n“Thank you. I have already learned all that is in the public prints, nothing more. I presume that I may take it as correct—this article, for example, as to the disappearance of the bride.”\nLord St. Simon glanced over it. “Yes, it is correct, as far as it goes.”\n“But it needs a great deal of supplementing before anyone could offer an opinion. I think that I may arrive at my facts most directly by questioning you.”\n“Pray do so.”\n“When did you first meet Miss Hatty Doran?”\n“In San Francisco, a year ago.”\n“You were travelling in the States?”\n“Yes.”\n“Did you become engaged then?”\n“No.”\n“But you were on a friendly footing?”\n“I was amused by her society, and she could see that I was amused.”\n“Her father is very rich?”\n“He is said to be the richest man on the Pacific slope.”\n“And how did he make his money?”\n“In mining. He had nothing a few years ago. Then he struck gold, invested it, and came up by leaps and bounds.”\n“Now, what is your own impression as to the young lady’s—your wife’s character?”\nThe nobleman swung his glasses a little faster and stared down into the fire. “You see, Mr. Holmes,” said he, “my wife was twenty before her father became a rich man. During that time she ran free in a mining camp and wandered through woods or mountains, so that her education has come from Nature rather than from the schoolmaster. She is what we call in England a tomboy, with a strong nature, wild and free, unfettered by any sort of traditions. She is impetuous—volcanic, I was about to say. She is swift in making up her mind and fearless in carrying out her resolutions. On the other hand, I would not have given her the name which I have the honour to bear”—he gave a little stately cough—“had I not thought her to be at bottom a noble woman. I believe that she is capable of heroic self-sacrifice and that anything dishonourable would be repugnant to her.”\n“Have you her photograph?”\n“I brought this with me.” He opened a locket and showed us the full face of a very lovely woman. It was not a photograph but an ivory miniature, and the artist had brought out the full effect of the lustrous black hair, the large dark eyes, and the exquisite mouth. Holmes gazed long and earnestly at it. Then he closed the locket and handed it back to Lord St. Simon.\n“The young lady came to London, then, and you renewed your acquaintance?”\n“Yes, her father brought her over for this last London season. I met her several times, became engaged to her, and have now married her.”\n“She brought, I understand, a considerable dowry?”\n“A fair dowry. Not more than is usual in my family.”\n“And this, of course, remains to you, since the marriage is a fait accompli?”\n“I really have made no inquiries on the subject.”\n“Very naturally not. Did you see Miss Doran on the day before the wedding?”\n“Yes.”\n“Was she in good spirits?”\n“Never better. She kept talking of what we should do in our future lives.”\n“Indeed! That is very interesting. And on the morning of the wedding?”\n“She was as bright as possible—at least until after the ceremony.”\n“And did you observe any change in her then?”\n“Well, to tell the truth, I saw then the first signs that I had ever seen that her temper was just a little sharp. The incident however, was too trivial to relate and can have no possible bearing upon the case.”\n“Pray let us have it, for all that.”\n“Oh, it is childish. She dropped her bouquet as we went towards the vestry. She was passing the front pew at the time, and it fell over into the pew. There was a moment’s delay, but the gentleman in the pew handed it up to her again, and it did not appear to be the worse for the fall. Yet when I spoke to her of the matter, she answered me abruptly; and in the carriage, on our way home, she seemed absurdly agitated over this trifling cause.”\n“Indeed! You say that there was a gentleman in the pew. Some of the general public were present, then?”\n“Oh, yes. It is impossible to exclude them when the church is open.”\n“This gentleman was not one of your wife’s friends?”\n“No, no; I call him a gentleman by courtesy, but he was quite a common-looking person. I hardly noticed his appearance. But really I think that we are wandering rather far from the point.”\n“Lady St. Simon, then, returned from the wedding in a less cheerful frame of mind than she had gone to it. What did she do on re-entering her father’s house?”",
          "paraphrase_gemini-2.5-flash-preview-04-17": "Holmes mentioned that the doorbell had rung, and since it was just after four o'clock, he was sure it was their aristocratic client. He strongly encouraged Watson to remain, stating he preferred having a witness present, if only to help him remember things. Their page-boy announced \"Lord Robert St. Simon\" as he opened the door. A man entered, possessing a pleasant, refined face, with a prominent, pale nose, perhaps a touch of irritability around the mouth, and the steady, clear eyes of someone accustomed to giving and receiving commands. His movements were quick, but his appearance gave an impression of being older than his years, marked by a slight forward bend and a small stoop in his walk. When he took off his hat, which had a very curly brim, his hair was seen to be graying at the edges and thin on top. His clothing was extremely detailed, bordering on excessive formality, featuring a high collar, black frock-coat, white waistcoat, yellow gloves, shiny patent-leather shoes, and pale gaiters. He advanced slowly into the room, looking left and right, swinging the cord attached to his golden eyeglasses in his right hand. Holmes stood, bowed, and greeted him, saying, \"Good-day, Lord St. Simon. Please take the basket-chair. This is my friend and colleague, Dr. Watson. Move a bit closer to the fire, and we can discuss this matter.\" Lord St. Simon stated it was a very painful experience for him, as could easily be imagined, saying he felt deeply wounded. He understood Holmes had handled similar sensitive situations before, but presumed they didn't involve people from such a high social stratum. Holmes replied he was \"descending,\" explaining his most recent such client had been a king. Surprised, Lord St. Simon asked which king, and Holmes named the King of Scandinavia. \"What! Did he lose his wife?\" Lord St. Simon asked. Holmes responded smoothly, \"You can appreciate that I maintain the same level of confidentiality for the affairs of my other clients as I promise for yours.\" \"Of course! Quite right! Quite right! I must beg your pardon,\" Lord St. Simon said. \"Regarding my own situation, I am ready to provide any information that might help you form an opinion.\" Holmes thanked him, stating he had only learned what was available in the public newspapers and nothing further. He asked if he could assume the newspaper reports were accurate, citing an article about the bride's disappearance as an example. Lord St. Simon reviewed it, confirming, \"Yes, it is correct, up to a point.\" Holmes commented that a great deal more information was required before an opinion could be formed, suggesting the quickest way to get the facts was by questioning him directly. Lord St. Simon agreed. Holmes began by asking when he first encountered Miss Hatty Doran. \"In San Francisco, a year ago,\" he replied. \"You were travelling in the United States?\" Holmes asked. \"Yes.\" \"Did you get engaged at that time?\" \"No.\" \"But you were on friendly terms?\" \"I found her company entertaining, and she was aware I was entertained.\" \"Is her father very wealthy?\" \"He is said to be the wealthiest man on the Pacific coast.\" \"And how did he acquire his fortune?\" \"Through mining. He had nothing just a few years ago. Then he discovered gold, invested it, and became rich very quickly.\" Holmes then asked about his impression of the young lady's, his wife's, character. The nobleman swung his glasses a little faster and gazed into the fire. \"You see, Mr. Holmes,\" he explained, \"my wife was twenty before her father became wealthy. During her earlier years, she grew up freely in a mining camp and explored woods and mountains, so her education came from nature rather than schoolmasters. She is what we call in England a tomboy, possessing a strong, wild, and free spirit, unconstrained by any traditions. She is impulsive – I would almost say volcanic. She makes decisions quickly and is fearless in carrying them out. On the other hand, I would not have given her the name I have the honour to bear\" – he gave a slight, dignified cough – \"if I had not believed her to be fundamentally a noble woman. I think she is capable of great self-sacrifice and would find anything dishonest repugnant.\" \"Do you have her photograph?\" Holmes asked. \"I brought this with me,\" he said, opening a locket to show the face of a beautiful woman. It was an ivory miniature, not a photograph, and the artist had perfectly captured her shining black hair, large dark eyes, and exquisite mouth. Holmes studied it for a long time with intense interest before closing the locket and giving it back. Holmes asked if the young lady came to London, and if they reconnected there. \"Yes, her father brought her for the most recent London season. I met her several times, we became engaged, and I have now married her.\" \"I understand she brought a considerable dowry?\" Holmes inquired. \"A reasonable dowry. No more than is typical in my family.\" \"And this, of course, remains with you, as the marriage is complete?\" Holmes pressed. \"I genuinely haven't inquired about the subject.\" \"Understandably not. Did you see Miss Doran the day before the wedding?\" \"Yes.\" \"Was she in good spirits?\" \"Never better. She kept talking about our plans for the future.\" \"Indeed! That's very interesting. And on the morning of the wedding?\" \"She was as cheerful as possible – at least until after the ceremony.\" \"And did you notice any change in her then?\" \"Well, to be honest, that's when I first saw any indication of her temper being slightly sharp. However, the incident was too trivial to recount and couldn't possibly be relevant to the case.\" \"Please tell us about it anyway.\" \"Oh, it's childish. She dropped her bouquet as we were walking towards the vestry. She was passing the front pew at the time, and it fell into it. There was a short delay, but the gentleman in the pew handed it back up to her, and it didn't seem damaged by the fall. Yet when I mentioned it to her, she replied abruptly; and in the carriage on the way home, she seemed unreasonably upset about this minor issue.\" \"Indeed! You mentioned there was a gentleman in the pew. Were some members of the public present, then?\" Holmes asked. \"Oh, yes. It's impossible to keep them out when the church is open.\" \"This gentleman wasn't a friend of your wife's?\" \"No, no; I call him a gentleman out of politeness, but he seemed quite an ordinary person. I barely noticed what he looked like. But truly, I think we are deviating quite far from the main point.\" Holmes then summarised, \"Lady St. Simon, then, returned from the wedding feeling less cheerful than when she went. What did she do when she re-entered her father's house?\"",
          "paraphrase_gpt-4.1-2025-04-14": "Holmes remarked that the ringing of the bell and the time suggested their distinguished client had arrived, encouraging Watson to stay as a witness. The page announced Lord Robert St. Simon, who entered: an elegant man, cultured but somewhat aged in appearance, with silvering hair, careful and somewhat extravagant clothing, and a brisk but stooped manner. Holmes greeted him, introduced Watson, and invited him to discuss his case. Lord St. Simon expressed his distress, noting Holmes’s reputation for handling sensitive problems, though his prior client was a king, not of the same social rank. Holmes assured him of confidentiality. St. Simon agreed and provided details about his missing bride, Miss Hatty Doran. He met her in San Francisco a year earlier, was drawn to her vivacious personality, and confirmed her father had become wealthy from mining. He described his wife’s tomboyish, independent nature but insisted on her noble and honorable character. He produced a miniature portrait of her. St. Simon recounted how their engagement was renewed in London, leading to marriage with a reasonable dowry. On the days surrounding the wedding, Miss Doran seemed happy until after the ceremony, when she became unexpectedly sharp and agitated over dropping her bouquet, a minor incident involving an unknown man in a pew. St. Simon believed the incident insignificant, but Holmes requested every detail. Finally, Holmes inquired into Lady St. Simon’s actions after returning to her father's house post-wedding."

She is an American and came from California with her.”\n“A confidential servant?”\n“A little too much so. It seemed to me that her mistress allowed her to take great liberties. Still, of course, in America they look upon these things in a different way.”\n“How long did she speak to this Alice?”\n“Oh, a few minutes. I had something else to think of.”\n“You did not overhear what they said?”\n“Lady St. Simon said something about ‘jumping a claim.’ She was accustomed to use slang of the kind. I have no idea what she meant.”\n“American slang is very expressive sometimes. And what did your wife do when she finished speaking to her maid?”\n“She walked into the breakfast-room.”\n“On your arm?”\n“No, alone. She was very independent in little matters like that. Then, after we had sat down for ten minutes or so, she rose hurriedly, muttered some words of apology, and left the room. She never came back.”\n“But this maid, Alice, as I understand, deposes that she went to her room, covered her bride’s dress with a long ulster, put on a bonnet, and went out.”\n“Quite so. And she was afterwards seen walking into Hyde Park in company with Flora Millar, a woman who is now in custody, and who had already made a disturbance at Mr. Doran’s house that morning.”\n“Ah, yes. I should like a few particulars as to this young lady, and your relations to her.”\nLord St. Simon shrugged his shoulders and raised his eyebrows. “We have been on a friendly footing for some years—I may say on a very friendly footing. She used to be at the Allegro. I have not treated her ungenerously, and she had no just cause of complaint against me, but you know what women are, Mr. Holmes. Flora was a dear little thing, but exceedingly hot-headed and devotedly attached to me. She wrote me dreadful letters when she heard that I was about to be married, and, to tell the truth, the reason why I had the marriage celebrated so quietly was that I feared lest there might be a scandal in the church. She came to Mr. Doran’s door just after we returned, and she endeavoured to push her way in, uttering very abusive expressions towards my wife, and even threatening her, but I had foreseen the possibility of something of the sort, and I had two police fellows there in private clothes, who soon pushed her out again. She was quiet when she saw that there was no good in making a row.”\n“Did your wife hear all this?”\n“No, thank goodness, she did not.”\n“And she was seen walking with this very woman afterwards?”\n“Yes. That is what Mr. Lestrade, of Scotland Yard, looks upon as so serious. It is thought that Flora decoyed my wife out and laid some terrible trap for her.”\n“Well, it is a possible supposition.”\n“You think so, too?”\n“I did not say a probable one. But you do not yourself look upon this as likely?”\n“I do not think Flora would hurt a fly.”\n“Still, jealousy is a strange transformer of characters. Pray what is your own theory as to what took place?”\n“Well, really, I came to seek a theory, not to propound one. I have given you all the facts. Since you ask me, however, I may say that it has occurred to me as possible that the excitement of this affair, the consciousness that she had made so immense a social stride, had the effect of causing some little nervous disturbance in my wife.”\n“In short, that she had become suddenly deranged?”\n“Well, really, when I consider that she has turned her back—I will not say upon me, but upon so much that many have aspired to without success—I can hardly explain it in any other fashion.”\n“Well, certainly that is also a conceivable hypothesis,” said Holmes, smiling. “And now, Lord St. Simon, I think that I have nearly all my data. May I ask whether you were seated at the breakfast-table so that you could see out of the window?”\n“We could see the other side of the road and the Park.”\n“Quite so. Then I do not think that I need to detain you longer. I shall communicate with you.”",
          "paraphrase_gemini-2.5-flash-preview-04-17": "Lord St. Simon stated he observed his wife talking with her maid. When asked the maid's identity, he replied she was an American named Alice, who had traveled from California with his wife. He felt Alice was overly familiar with her mistress, who seemed to grant her excessive freedom, though he noted American customs might differ regarding such relationships. The conversation lasted only a few minutes, as he had other things on his mind. He didn't overhear much but caught his wife saying something about 'jumping a claim,' a type of slang she occasionally used, whose meaning he didn't grasp. Holmes commented on the expressiveness of American slang. Regarding what his wife did next, St. Simon said she entered the breakfast-room alone, as she was quite independent in minor matters. After they had been seated for about ten minutes, she suddenly got up, mumbled an apology, and left the room, never coming back. St. Simon confirmed that, according to the maid Alice, his wife went to her room, covered her wedding dress with a long overcoat, put on a hat, and went outside. She was then seen walking into Hyde Park accompanied by Flora Millar, a woman currently in custody who had caused a disturbance at Mr. Doran's house earlier that day. Holmes requested more details about Flora Millar and St. Simon's relationship with her. St. Simon indicated they had been close friends for several years, even \"very friendly,\" and she had been a performer at the Allegro. He maintained he had treated her well and she had no just reason to complain, but he acknowledged women can be unpredictable. He described Flora as sweet but very passionate and deeply devoted to him. She wrote angry letters upon hearing of his marriage, which was kept quiet partly to avoid a church scandal involving her. Flora arrived at Mr. Doran's house just after the couple returned and tried to force her way in, yelling insults and threats at his new wife. St. Simon had anticipated this and had two plainclothes police officers present who promptly removed her. She calmed down when she realized making a scene was pointless. St. Simon confirmed his wife did not hear this outburst. Holmes noted it was curious she was later seen walking with this same woman. St. Simon explained this was the point Scotland Yard's Mr. Lestrade found particularly concerning, suggesting Flora might have lured his wife out and set a trap. Holmes agreed this was a 'possible supposition' but didn't call it probable. St. Simon stated he didn't think Flora was capable of harming anyone. Holmes countered that jealousy could dramatically alter character and asked St. Simon's own theory. St. Simon admitted he had come seeking theories, not offering one, having provided all the facts. However, when pressed, he suggested the excitement of the situation and the realization of her significant social advancement might have caused his wife some nervous instability. Holmes interpreted this as him suggesting she had suddenly gone mad. St. Simon felt it was hard to explain otherwise, given she had abandoned not just him, but a prestigious position many desired unsuccessfully. Holmes conceded this was a 'conceivable hypothesis' as well, smiling. He then felt he had gathered most of the necessary information, asking if St. Simon could see out the window from the breakfast table (they could see the opposite side of the road and the Park). Finding this sufficient, Holmes stated he didn't need to keep him longer and would contact him later.",

And tell me, what outcome were you hoping for by looking at these?”“To find some piece of evidence that links Flora Millar to the disappearance.”“I suspect you’ll find that quite difficult.”“Do you, indeed, now?” Lestrade shot back with clear irritation. “I fear, Holmes, that your deductions and conclusions aren't very practical. You’ve already been wrong twice in just a few minutes. This dress *does* implicate Miss Flora Millar.”“And how is that?”“The dress contains a pocket. Inside the pocket is a card-case. In the card-case is a note. And here is that exact note.” He forcefully placed it on the table in front of him. “Listen to this: ‘You will see me when all is ready. Come at once. F. H. M.’ Now, my theory from the start has been that Lady St. Simon was deliberately led away by Flora Millar, and that she, likely with others, is responsible for her vanishing. This, signed with her initials, is the very note that was undoubtedly slipped into her hand discreetly at the door, luring her within their grasp.”“Very good, Lestrade,” Holmes said, chuckling. “You are genuinely quite excellent. Let me see it.” He picked up the paper in a seemingly uninterested manner, but his attention immediately became fixed, and he let out a quiet exclamation of satisfaction. “This is truly significant,” he stated.“Aha! You think so?”“Extremely. I congratulate you most sincerely.”Swelling with pride, Lestrade stood up and leaned over to look. “Wait,” he gasped, “you’re looking at the back!”“On the contrary,” Holmes corrected, “this is the correct side.”“The correct side? You’re mad! The note written in pencil is here!”“And over here,” Holmes indicated, “is what appears to be a fragment of a hotel bill, which holds my deep interest.”“There’s nothing important on it. I checked it before,” Lestrade said dismissively. “‘Oct. 4th, rooms 8s., breakfast 2s. 6d., cocktail 1s., lunch 2s. 6d., glass sherry, 8d.’ I don’t see anything in that at all.”“Very likely not,” Holmes agreed, “but it is exceptionally important nonetheless.

Good day, Mr. Holmes, and we shall see who resolves this matter first.” He gathered the clothing, shoved them back into his bag, and moved towards the door.",
          "paraphrase_gpt-4.1-2025-04-14": "“Oh, is that so!” my companion said, sending smoke rings into the air. “So you recovered the clothes from the Serpentine?”\n“No, they were found floating near the edge of the water by a park-keeper. They’ve been identified as belonging to her, and I thought that if the clothes were nearby, the body wouldn’t be far away.”\n“By that kind of reasoning, a person’s body should always be close to their wardrobe. And what did you hope to learn from this?”\n“I was searching for evidence linking Flora Millar to the disappearance.”\n“I think that’s going to be a challenge for you.”\n“Really?” Lestrade retorted, clearly irritated. “Holmes, your deductions sometimes aren’t very grounded in reality. In a span of two minutes, you’ve made two mistakes. This dress does connect Miss Flora Millar to the case.”\n“In what way?”\n“There’s a pocket in the dress. Inside the pocket is a card case. And in the card case, there’s a note. Here is the note itself.” He placed it on the table in front of us. “Listen to this: ‘You will see me when all is ready. Come at once. F. H. M.’ I’ve believed all along that Lady St. Simon was enticed away by Flora Millar, and she and her accomplices orchestrated her disappearance. This note, with Flora Millar’s initials, was most likely discreetly given to Lady St. Simon at the door, luring her into their trap.”\n“Very good, Lestrade,” Holmes said with amusement. “You really are impressive. May I see the note?” He took it in a nonchalant manner, but his interest was immediately piqued, and he gave a pleased exclamation. “This is really significant,” he said.\n“So, you think so too?”\n“Absolutely. My compliments.”\nLestrade, visibly pleased, leaned over to look at the note with him. “Wait, you’re looking at the wrong side!” he shouted.\n“Not at all. This is precisely the side I’m interested in.”\n“The right side? You must be joking! The note is in pencil here.”\n“But on the other side is part of a hotel bill, which I find quite fascinating.”\n“That’s just nonsense. I already checked it,” Lestrade said. “‘Oct. 4th, rooms 8 shillings, breakfast 2s. 6d., cocktail 1s., lunch 2s. 6d., glass of sherry, 8 pence.’ I don’t see anything in that.”\n“Perhaps not, but all the same, it’s very important. And the note, or at least the initials, matter as well, so my congratulations again.”\n“I’ve spent enough time on this,” Lestrade said, getting up. “I believe in real work, not just sitting by the fire and spinning theories. Good day, Mr. Holmes. We’ll see who solves this first.” He collected the clothes, stuffed them into his bag, and left."

          "text_segment": "“Just one hint to you, Lestrade,” drawled Holmes before his rival vanished; “I will tell you the true solution of the matter. Lady St. Simon is a myth. There is not, and there never has been, any such person.”\nLestrade looked sadly at my companion. Then he turned to me, tapped his forehead three times, shook his head solemnly, and hurried away.\nHe had hardly shut the door behind him when Holmes rose to put on his overcoat. “There is something in what the fellow says about outdoor work,” he remarked, “so I think, Watson, that I must leave you to your papers for a little.”\nIt was after five o’clock when Sherlock Holmes left me, but I had no time to be lonely, for within an hour there arrived a confectioner’s man with a very large flat box. This he unpacked with the help of a youth whom he had brought with him, and presently, to my very great astonishment, a quite epicurean little cold supper began to be laid out upon our humble lodging-house mahogany. There were a couple of brace of cold woodcock, a pheasant, a pâté de foie gras pie with a group of ancient and cobwebby bottles. Having laid out all these luxuries, my two visitors vanished away, like the genii of the Arabian Nights, with no explanation save that the things had been paid for and were ordered to this address.\nJust before nine o’clock Sherlock Holmes stepped briskly into the room. His features were gravely set, but there was a light in his eye which made me think that he had not been disappointed in his conclusions.\n“They have laid the supper, then,” he said, rubbing his hands.\n“You seem to expect company. They have laid for five.”\n“Yes, I fancy we may have some company dropping in,” said he. “I am surprised that Lord St. Simon has not already arrived. Ha! I fancy that I hear his step now upon the stairs.”\nIt was indeed our visitor of the afternoon who came bustling in, dangling his glasses more vigorously than ever, and with a very perturbed expression upon his aristocratic features.\n“My messenger reached you, then?” asked Holmes.\n“Yes, and I confess that the contents startled me beyond measure. Have you good authority for what you say?”\n“The best possible.”\nLord St. Simon sank into a chair and passed his hand over his forehead.\n“What will the Duke say,” he murmured, “when he hears that one of the family has been subjected to such humiliation?”\n“It is the purest accident. I cannot allow that there is any humiliation.”\n“Ah, you look on these things from another standpoint.”\n“I fail to see that anyone is to blame. I can hardly see how the lady could have acted otherwise, though her abrupt method of doing it was undoubtedly to be regretted. Having no mother, she had no one to advise her at such a crisis.”\n“It was a slight, sir, a public slight,” said Lord St. Simon, tapping his fingers upon the table.\n“You must make allowance for this poor girl, placed in so unprecedented a position.”\n“I will make no allowance. I am very angry indeed, and I have been shamefully used.”\n“I think that I heard a ring,” said Holmes. “Yes, there are steps on the landing. If I cannot persuade you to take a lenient view of the matter, Lord St. Simon, I have brought an advocate here who may be more successful.” He opened the door and ushered in a lady and gentleman. “Lord St. Simon,” said he “allow me to introduce you to Mr. and Mrs. Francis Hay Moulton. The lady, I think, you have already met.”\nAt the sight of these newcomers our client had sprung from his seat and stood very erect, with his eyes cast down and his hand thrust into the breast of his frock-coat, a picture of offended dignity. The lady had taken a quick step forward and had held out her hand to him, but he still refused to raise his eyes. It was as well for his resolution, perhaps, for her pleading face was one which it was hard to resist.\n“You’re angry, Robert,” said she. “Well, I guess you have every cause to be.”\n“Pray make no apology to me,” said Lord St. Simon bitterly.\n“Oh, yes, I know that I have treated you real bad and that I should have spoken to you before I went; but I was kind of rattled, and from the time when I saw Frank here again I just didn’t know what I was doing or saying. I only wonder I didn’t fall down and do a faint right there before the altar.”\n“Perhaps, Mrs. Moulton, you would like my friend and me to leave the room while you explain this matter?”\n“If I may give an opinion,” remarked the strange gentleman, “we’ve had just a little too much secrecy over this business already. For my part, I should like all Europe and America to hear the rights of it.” He was a small, wiry, sunburnt man, clean-shaven, with a sharp face and alert manner.\n“Then I’ll tell our story right away,” said the lady. “Frank here and I met in ’84, in McQuire’s camp, near the Rockies, where Pa was working a claim. We were engaged to each other, Frank and I; but then one day father struck a rich pocket and made a pile, while poor Frank here had a claim that petered out and came to nothing. The richer Pa grew the poorer was Frank; so at last Pa wouldn’t hear of our engagement lasting any longer, and he took me away to ’Frisco. Frank wouldn’t throw up his hand, though; so he followed me there, and he saw me without Pa knowing anything about it. It would only have made him mad to know, so we just fixed it all up for ourselves. Frank said that he would go and make his pile, too, and never come back to claim me until he had as much as Pa. So then I promised to wait for him to the end of time and pledged myself not to marry anyone else while he lived. ‘Why shouldn’t we be married right away, then,’ said he, ‘and then I will feel sure of you; and I won’t claim to be your husband until I come back?’ Well, we talked it over, and he had fixed it all up so nicely, with a clergyman all ready in waiting, that we just did it right there; and then Frank went off to seek his fortune, and I went back to Pa.\n“The next I heard of Frank was that he was in Montana, and then he went prospecting in Arizona, and then I heard of him from New Mexico. After that came a long newspaper story about how a miners’ camp had been attacked by Apache Indians, and there was my Frank’s name among the killed. I fainted dead away, and I was very sick for months after. Pa thought I had a decline and took me to half the doctors in ’Frisco. Not a word of news came for a year and more, so that I never doubted that Frank was really dead. Then Lord St. Simon came to ’Frisco, and we came to London, and a marriage was arranged, and Pa was very pleased, but I felt all the time that no man on this earth would ever take the place in my heart that had been given to my poor Frank.\n“Still, if I had married Lord St. Simon, of course I’d have done my duty by him. We can’t command our love, but we can our actions. I went to the altar with him with the intention to make him just as good a wife as it was in me to be. But you may imagine what I felt when, just as I came to the altar rails, I glanced back and saw Frank standing and looking at me out of the first pew. I thought it was his ghost at first; but when I looked again there he was still, with a kind of question in his eyes, as if to ask me whether I were glad or sorry to see him. I wonder I didn’t drop. I know that everything was turning round, and the words of the clergyman were just like the buzz of a bee in my ear. I didn’t know what to do. Should I stop the service and make a scene in the church? I glanced at him again, and he seemed to know what I was thinking, for he raised his finger to his lips to tell me to be still. Then I saw him scribble on a piece of paper, and I knew that he was writing me a note. As I passed his pew on the way out I dropped my bouquet over to him, and he slipped the note into my hand when he returned me the flowers. It was only a line asking me to join him when he made the sign to me to do so. Of course I never doubted for a moment that my first duty was now to him, and I determined to do just whatever he might direct.\n“When I got back I told my maid, who had known him in California, and had always been his friend. I ordered her to say nothing, but to get a few things packed and my ulster ready. I know I ought to have spoken to Lord St. Simon, but it was dreadful hard before his mother and all those great people. I just made up my mind to run away and explain afterwards. I hadn’t been at the table ten minutes before I saw Frank out of the window at the other side of the road. He beckoned to me and then began walking into the Park. I slipped out, put on my things, and followed him. Some woman came talking something or other about Lord St. Simon to me—seemed to me from the little I heard as if he had a little secret of his own before marriage also—but I managed to get away from her and soon overtook Frank. We got into a cab together, and away we drove to some lodgings he had taken in Gordon Square, and that was my true wedding after all those years of waiting. Frank had been a prisoner among the Apaches, had escaped, came on to ’Frisco, found that I had given him up for dead and had gone to England, followed me there, and had come upon me at last on the very morning of my second wedding.”\n“I saw it in a paper,” explained the American. “It gave the name and the church but not where the lady lived.”\n“Then we had a talk as to what we should do, and Frank was all for openness, but I was so ashamed of it all that I felt as if I should like to vanish away and never see any of them again—just sending a line to Pa, perhaps, to show him that I was alive. It was awful to me to think of all those lords and ladies sitting round that breakfast-table and waiting for me to come back. So Frank took my wedding-clothes and things and made a bundle of them, so that I should not be traced, and dropped them away somewhere where no one could find them. It is likely that we should have gone on to Paris to-morrow, only that this good gentleman, Mr. Holmes, came round to us this evening, though how he found us is more than I can think, and he showed us very clearly and kindly that I was wrong and that Frank was right, and that we should be putting ourselves in the wrong if we were so secret. Then he offered to give us a chance of talking to Lord St. Simon alone, and so we came right away round to his rooms at once. Now, Robert, you have heard it all, and I am very sorry if I have given you pain, and I hope that you do not think very meanly of me.”",
          "paraphrase_gemini-2.5-flash-preview-04-17": "As his competitor, Lestrade, was leaving, Holmes casually offered him a clue, stating he knew the real answer to the mystery. He declared that ‘Lady St. Simon’ was a fabricated person and had never actually existed. Lestrade cast a despondent look at Holmes, then turned to me, tapped his forehead three times, shook his head gravely, and quickly departed. Almost immediately after Lestrade closed the door, Holmes stood up to put on his coat. He commented that there was some truth in the notion that outdoor activity was beneficial, and suggested he would leave me to my work for a while. It was after five o’clock when Holmes departed, but I wasn’t left alone for long. Within an hour, a man from a confectionery arrived with a large, flat box. With the help of a young assistant, he unpacked it, and to my considerable surprise, they began setting out a lavish cold supper on our plain mahogany table. The feast included several cold woodcocks, a pheasant, a pâté de foie gras pie, and a selection of dusty old wine bottles. After arranging these luxurious items, the two visitors vanished as suddenly as if by magic, offering no explanation other than that everything was paid for and ordered to our address. Holmes returned just before nine, entering the room briskly. His expression was serious, but the spark in his eyes suggested his conclusions had been accurate. He saw the table and, rubbing his hands together, remarked, 'They've laid the supper, then.' I replied that he seemed to be expecting company and that the table was set for five. Holmes confirmed that he anticipated guests might drop in, adding that he was surprised Lord St. Simon hadn’t arrived yet. He then heard steps and believed it might be him. Indeed, it was our visitor from the afternoon, who rushed in, swinging his glasses more energetically than before, his noble face showing considerable distress. Holmes asked if his message had reached him. Lord St. Simon confirmed it had and confessed that its contents had greatly shocked him, questioning if Holmes had reliable information. Holmes assured him it was 'the best possible.' Lord St. Simon slumped into a chair, wiping his hand across his forehead. He worried aloud about his father, the Duke,’s reaction to a family member facing such ‘humiliation.’ Holmes argued it was a mere accident and not humiliating. Lord St. Simon countered that Holmes viewed things differently. Holmes maintained that no one was to blame and struggled to see how the lady could have acted otherwise, though her abrupt departure was regrettable. He added that lacking a mother, she had no one to advise her during such a crisis. Lord St. Simon, tapping the table, called it an insult, a 'public slight.' Holmes urged him to be understanding towards the unfortunate girl in her unprecedented situation. Lord St. Simon refused, stating he was very angry and felt he had been treated disgracefully. Holmes then heard a ring and footsteps outside, identifying them as being on the landing. He told Lord St. Simon that if he couldn’t persuade him to be more lenient, he had brought someone who might succeed. He opened the door and brought in a lady and a gentleman. 'Lord St. Simon,' he announced, 'allow me to introduce Mr. and Mrs. Francis Hay Moulton. I believe you have met the lady before.' Upon seeing the newcomers, our client leaped from his seat and stood stiffly, eyes downcast, hand tucked into his frock-coat breast—a picture of wounded pride. The lady quickly stepped forward and extended her hand to him, but he wouldn't look up. It was likely fortunate for his resolve, as her pleading face was difficult to resist. 'You're angry, Robert,' she said. 'Well, I suppose you have every reason to be.' 'Please don't apologize to me,' Lord St. Simon replied bitterly. 'Oh, yes, I know I treated you very badly and should have spoken to you before leaving,' she continued, 'but I was rather bewildered, and after seeing Frank again, I honestly didn’t know what I was doing or saying. I'm surprised I didn't just collapse right there at the altar.' Mr. Moulton interjected, suggesting that if his opinion mattered, there had already been too much secrecy in the affair. He personally wished the whole world knew the truth. He was described as a small, lean, sunburnt man, clean-shaven, with a sharp, alert look. 'Then I'll tell our story right away,' the lady said. 'Frank and I met in 1884 at McQuire's camp near the Rockies, where my father was working a mining claim. We got engaged. But then, Father found a rich seam and made a fortune, while poor Frank's claim ran dry and came to nothing. As Father grew richer, Frank became poorer, until Father absolutely refused to let our engagement continue and took me to San Francisco. Frank didn't give up, though; he followed me there and saw me without Father’s knowledge. Telling Father would just have made him angry, so we handled it ourselves. Frank said he would go make his own fortune and wouldn't come back for me until he was as wealthy as Father. So I promised to wait for him forever and vowed not to marry anyone else as long as he was alive. Then he asked, 'Why don’t we get married right away? That way I'll be sure of you, and I won't claim to be your husband until I return.' We discussed it, and he had everything arranged perfectly, even a clergyman ready, so we just got married then and there. Frank left to seek his fortune, and I went back to Father. The next I heard, Frank was in Montana, then prospecting in Arizona, and later I heard from New Mexico. After that, a long newspaper article described an Apache attack on a miners' camp, and Frank’s name was listed among the dead. I fainted and was very ill for months afterward. Father thought I had a decline and took me to many doctors in San Francisco. With no news for over a year, I was sure Frank was dead. Then Lord St. Simon came to San Francisco, we traveled to London, and a marriage was arranged. Father was very happy, but all along, I felt no one could ever replace my poor Frank in my heart. Still, if I had married Lord St. Simon, I would have done my duty by him. While we can't control our love, we can control our actions. I went to the altar intending to be the best wife I could be. But you can imagine how I felt when, as I reached the altar rails, I looked back and saw Frank standing and watching me from the first pew. At first, I thought it was his ghost, but when I looked again, he was still there, with a questioning look in his eyes, as if asking if I was happy or sad to see him. I’m amazed I didn’t collapse. Everything seemed to spin, and the clergyman's voice sounded like a buzzing bee. I didn't know what to do. Should I stop the service and cause a scene in the church? I glanced at him again, and he seemed to understand what I was thinking because he raised a finger to his lips, telling me to be quiet. Then I saw him scribble on paper and knew he was writing me a note. As I passed his pew on the way out, I dropped my bouquet towards him, and he slipped the note into my hand when he returned the flowers. It was just a line asking me to meet him when he signaled. Of course, I had no doubt that my primary duty was now to him, and I decided to do whatever he instructed. When I got back, I told my maid, who had known him in California and was always his friend. I told her to keep quiet but pack a few things and get my ulster ready. I know I should have spoken to Lord St. Simon, but it was incredibly difficult with his mother and all those important people there. I simply decided to run away and explain later. I hadn't been at the table for ten minutes before I saw Frank from the window across the road. He beckoned me and started walking towards the Park. I slipped out, put on my coat, and followed him. Some woman tried to talk to me about Lord St. Simon—from the little I overheard, it seemed as if he might have had a little secret of his own before the marriage too—but I managed to get away from her and soon caught up with Frank. We got into a cab together and drove to some lodgings he had taken in Gordon Square, and that, after all those years of waiting, was my true wedding. Frank had been an Apache prisoner, had escaped, traveled to San Francisco, discovered I thought he was dead and had gone to England, followed me there, and finally found me on the very morning of my second wedding.' 'I saw it in a newspaper,' the American explained. 'It gave the name and the church, but not the lady's address.' 'Then we discussed what to do,' the lady continued. 'Frank wanted to be open about everything, but I was so ashamed I felt like I wanted to disappear and never see any of them again—perhaps just send a note to Father to let him know I was alive. It was dreadful to think of all those lords and ladies sitting around that breakfast table waiting for me to return. So Frank bundled my wedding clothes and belongings to prevent me from being traced and discarded them somewhere no one could find them. We would likely have gone to Paris tomorrow, except that this kind gentleman, Mr. Holmes, came to us this evening—though how he found us is beyond me. He showed us very clearly and kindly that I was wrong and Frank was right, and that being so secretive would put us in the wrong. Then he offered us the chance to speak to Lord St. Simon alone, so we came straight here to his rooms. Now, Robert, you’ve heard everything, and I’m very sorry if I've caused you pain, and I hope you don’t think too badly of me.'",
          "paraphrase_gpt-4.1-2025-04-14": "\"Just a word of advice, Lestrade,\" said Holmes languidly before his counterpart left the room. \"I'll reveal the actual truth of the case: Lady St. Simon doesn't exist. There's never been such a person.\"\n\nLestrade cast a sorrowful glance at Holmes, then turned to me, tapped his temple three times, shook his head with gravity, then quickly left. As soon as the door closed behind him, Holmes got up and began putting on his overcoat. \"There might be something to Lestrade's comments about fresh air,\" he commented, \"so I'll leave you to your work for a while, Watson.\"\n\nHolmes left me shortly after five, but I didn't have time to feel lonely. Not an hour later, a deliveryman from a confectioner's arrived with an assistant, bearing a vast, flat box. With much fuss, they unpacked a sumptuous little cold supper onto our modest mahogany table—woodcocks, pheasant, a pâté de foie gras, and several antique bottles. After setting out the generous spread, the pair left silently, providing no explanation other than that the items were prepaid and sent to this address.\n\nJust before nine, Holmes returned in good spirits though grave-faced, and I caught a gleam in his eye that suggested his expectations had not been disappointed.\n\n\"Supper's served, then,\" he said, rubbing his hands. \n\"Expecting visitors? There are place settings for five.\"\n\n\"Indeed, we may have some guests dropping by,\" replied Holmes. \"I’m surprised Lord St. Simon isn’t here yet. Ah! I think that's his step on the stairs now.\"\n\nIt was indeed our afternoon caller, Lord St. Simon, who bustled in, fiddling nervously with his glasses and looking profoundly unsettled. \n\n\"So my messenger reached you?\" Holmes inquired.\n\n\"Yes,\" the lord replied. \"And your message truly shocked me. Do you have solid proof of what you've claimed?\"\n\n\"Nothing could be firmer,\" Holmes asserted.\n\nLord St. Simon sank into a chair, rubbing his brow. \n\n\"What will the Duke say,\" he murmured, \"when he finds that a family member has endured such disgrace?\"\n\n\"It was a pure accident. I believe there's no humiliation to be found here.\"\n\n\"You view these things differently.\"\n\n\"I see no one truly at fault. And I think the woman was placed in a difficult situation—her abruptness is regrettable, but without a mother, she had no counselor at such a moment.\"\n\n\"It was an insult, a public one,\" the lord insisted, drumming his fingers on the table.\n\n\"You must sympathize with the girl, given her unprecedented situation.\"\n\n\"I cannot and will not excuse it. I am deeply angry and have been treated abominably.\"\n\n\"I believe someone's at the door,\" Holmes interrupted. \"Yes, footsteps on the landing. If I can’t persuade you to be sympathetic about this, Lord St. Simon, I’ve invited someone who may be more persuasive.\" Holmes opened the door and introduced a man and a woman. \"Lord St. Simon, allow me to present Mr. and Mrs. Francis Hay Moulton. I think you recognize the lady.\"\n\nAt their entrance, Lord St. Simon shot up, standing stiffly with eyes downcast and hand tucked into his coat, brimming with offended dignity. The lady reached out to him, but he denied her his gaze. Perhaps it was for the best—for her imploring look would be hard to refuse.\n\n\"You're upset, Robert,\" she said gently. \"And I can't blame you.\"\n\n\"Please don't apologize to me,\" Lord St. Simon responded coldly.\n\n\"I know I treated you poorly and should have spoken before leaving; but I was flustered, and once I saw Frank again I was all in confusion. It's a wonder I didn't faint right at the altar.\"\n\n\"Perhaps Mrs. Moulton would prefer my friend and me to step out while she explains?\"\n\n\"May I say,\" the unfamiliar man spoke up, \"there’s already been too much secrecy about all this. I'd prefer if the whole world knew the truth.\"\n\n\"Then I'll tell it now,\" the woman said. \"Frank and I met in 1884 at McQuire's camp by the Rockies, where my father was working. We became engaged. However, when my dad struck gold and Frank’s claim failed, father forbade the match and took me to San Francisco. Frank didn't give up and followed, seeing me in secret. It would only have angered my father had he known, so we kept things private. Frank vowed not to seek me out until he matched my father in success. I promised to wait for him, marrying no one else so long as he lived. 'Why not marry now?' Frank asked, 'then I know you’re mine, even if I don’t claim you as wife until I return.' We talked it over and, with a waiting clergyman, we married secretly. Frank set off to seek his fortune and I returned to my father.\n\n\"I later heard that Frank was prospecting through Montana and Arizona, then New Mexico. Then I read a newspaper report that Frank was among miners killed by Apache Indians. I fainted, fell ill, and my father thought me seriously unwell, taking me to many doctors. There was silence for over a year, and I was fully convinced Frank was dead. Then Lord St. Simon showed up in San Francisco. We traveled to London, arranged a marriage, and though my heart remained with Frank, I was determined to be a devoted wife to Lord St. Simon. But when I reached the altar and glimpsed Frank in a pew, I thought I'd seen a ghost. Seeing him again, with a questioning look in his eyes, made the world spin. Should I stop the ceremony? He made a discreet gesture urging me to keep quiet and surreptitiously handed me a note as I passed, inviting me to join him when he signaled. I understood then that my first duty was to him and resolved to follow his lead.\n\n\"Returning home, I told my maid, who had known Frank in California and supported him. I instructed her to prepare some belongings and keep quiet. I know I should have said something to Lord St. Simon, but facing him and his family was too much. I chose to slip away quietly and explain later. I saw Frank waiting across the street and discreetly followed him into the park. On my way, a woman approached, mentioning something about Lord St. Simon’s own potential secret, but I ignored her and hurried on. Soon, I was reunited with Frank, and together we went to lodgings he had arranged. That was our true wedding after all those years of separation. Frank had survived captivity among the Apaches, escaped, gone to San Francisco, and learning of my departure, had followed me to England, finding me on my wedding day.\"\n\n\"I saw the announcement in a newspaper,\" the American man added. \"It listed the names and church, but not the home address.\"\n\n\"After talking things over, Frank wanted to resolve everything openly, but I was mortified by the scandal. I contemplated disappearing entirely, just sending my father a note saying I was alive, but Frank bundled up my wedding clothes and disposed of them to avoid a trail. We would have gone to Paris tomorrow if Mr. Holmes hadn't arrived and kindly convinced us that honesty was best, and that secrecy would only put us in the wrong. He arranged for us to see Lord St. Simon privately, and here we are. Now, Robert, you’ve heard everything. I’m truly sorry for any pain I’ve given you, and hope you don’t think too badly of me.\""

          "text_segment": "Lord St. Simon had by no means relaxed his rigid attitude, but had listened with a frowning brow and a compressed lip to this long narrative.\n“Excuse me,” he said, “but it is not my custom to discuss my most intimate personal affairs in this public manner.”\n“Then you won’t forgive me? You won’t shake hands before I go?”\n“Oh, certainly, if it would give you any pleasure.” He put out his hand and coldly grasped that which she extended to him.\n“I had hoped,” suggested Holmes, “that you would have joined us in a friendly supper.”\n“I think that there you ask a little too much,” responded his Lordship. “I may be forced to acquiesce in these recent developments, but I can hardly be expected to make merry over them. I think that with your permission I will now wish you all a very good-night.” He included us all in a sweeping bow and stalked out of the room.\n“Then I trust that you at least will honour me with your company,” said Sherlock Holmes. “It is always a joy to meet an American, Mr. Moulton, for I am one of those who believe that the folly of a monarch and the blundering of a minister in far-gone years will not prevent our children from being some day citizens of the same world-wide country under a flag which shall be a quartering of the Union Jack with the Stars and Stripes.”\n“The case has been an interesting one,” remarked Holmes when our visitors had left us, “because it serves to show very clearly how simple the explanation may be of an affair which at first sight seems to be almost inexplicable. Nothing could be more natural than the sequence of events as narrated by this lady, and nothing stranger than the result when viewed, for instance, by Mr. Lestrade of Scotland Yard.”\n“You were not yourself at fault at all, then?”\n“From the first, two facts were very obvious to me, the one that the lady had been quite willing to undergo the wedding ceremony, the other that she had repented of it within a few minutes of returning home. Obviously something had occurred during the morning, then, to cause her to change her mind. What could that something be? She could not have spoken to anyone when she was out, for she had been in the company of the bridegroom. Had she seen someone, then? If she had, it must be someone from America because she had spent so short a time in this country that she could hardly have allowed anyone to acquire so deep an influence over her that the mere sight of him would induce her to change her plans so completely. You see we have already arrived, by a process of exclusion, at the idea that she might have seen an American. Then who could this American be, and why should he possess so much influence over her? It might be a lover; it might be a husband. Her young womanhood had, I knew, been spent in rough scenes and under strange conditions. So far I had got before I ever heard Lord St. Simon’s narrative. When he told us of a man in a pew, of the change in the bride’s manner, of so transparent a device for obtaining a note as the dropping of a bouquet, of her resort to her confidential maid, and of her very significant allusion to claim-jumping—which in miners’ parlance means taking possession of that which another person has a prior claim to—the whole situation became absolutely clear. She had gone off with a man, and the man was either a lover or was a previous husband—the chances being in favour of the latter.”\n“And how in the world did you find them?”\n“It might have been difficult, but friend Lestrade held information in his hands the value of which he did not himself know. The initials were, of course, of the highest importance, but more valuable still was it to know that within a week he had settled his bill at one of the most select London hotels.”\n“How did you deduce the select?”\n“By the select prices. Eight shillings for a bed and eightpence for a glass of sherry pointed to one of the most expensive hotels. There are not many in London which charge at that rate. In the second one which I visited in Northumberland Avenue, I learned by an inspection of the book that Francis H. Moulton, an American gentleman, had left only the day before, and on looking over the entries against him, I came upon the very items which I had seen in the duplicate bill. His letters were to be forwarded to 226 Gordon Square; so thither I travelled, and being fortunate enough to find the loving couple at home, I ventured to give them some paternal advice and to point out to them that it would be better in every way that they should make their position a little clearer both to the general public and to Lord St. Simon in particular. I invited them to meet him here, and, as you see, I made him keep the appointment.”\n“But with no very good result,” I remarked. “His conduct was certainly not very gracious.”\n“Ah, Watson,” said Holmes, smiling, “perhaps you would not be very gracious either, if, after all the trouble of wooing and wedding, you found yourself deprived in an instant of wife and of fortune. I think that we may judge Lord St. Simon very mercifully and thank our stars that we are never likely to find ourselves in the same position. Draw your chair up and hand me my violin, for the only problem we have still to solve is how to while away these bleak autumnal evenings.”",
          "paraphrase_gemini-2.5-flash-preview-04-17": "Lord St. Simon maintained his stern posture, listening intently with a furrowed brow and tightened lips to the lengthy account. “Pardon me,” he stated, “but I am not accustomed to discussing my deeply personal matters publicly.” The lady asked, “Then you will not forgive me? You won’t shake my hand before I leave?” He replied, “Oh, certainly, if it provides you any satisfaction.” He extended his hand and coolly clasped hers. “I had hoped,” suggested Holmes, “that you might join us for a friendly meal.” “I believe that is asking rather a lot,” responded his Lordship. “While I must accept these recent developments, I can hardly be expected to celebrate them. I think, with your permission, I will now bid you all a very good evening.” He gave a sweeping bow to everyone present and exited the room stiffly. “Then I trust that you, at least, will favor me with your company,” said Sherlock Holmes. “It is always a pleasure to encounter an American, Mr. Moulton, for I am one of those who believe that the foolishness of a king and the errors of a minister many years ago will not prevent our descendants from eventually being citizens of the same global nation under a flag combining the Union Jack and the Stars and Stripes.” “The case has been an interesting one,” remarked Holmes after our guests had departed, “because it serves to illustrate how remarkably straightforward the explanation can be for a situation that initially appears nearly impossible to understand. Nothing could be more logical than the sequence of events as told by this woman, and yet nothing stranger than the outcome when viewed, for example, by someone like Mr. Lestrade from Scotland Yard.” “So, you made no mistakes yourself, then?” I asked. “From the beginning, two facts were perfectly clear to me: first, that the lady was entirely willing to go through with the wedding ceremony, and second, that she regretted it within moments of arriving back home. Evidently, something happened that morning to cause her to change her mind so abruptly. What could that something be? She couldn’t have spoken to anyone while she was out, as she was constantly with the groom. So, did she see someone, then? If so, it must have been someone from America, because she had been in this country for such a short time that it’s unlikely anyone here could have gained such profound influence over her that merely seeing them would make her completely alter her plans. You see, through a process of elimination, we’ve already arrived at the possibility that she might have seen an American. Then, who could this American be, and why would he possess so much sway over her? It could be a lover; it could be a husband. I knew her youth had been spent in challenging environments and under unusual circumstances. I had reached this point in my thinking even before I heard Lord St. Simon’s account. When he told us about a man in a church pew, the sudden change in the bride’s demeanor, the obviously staged action of dropping a bouquet to retrieve a note, her confession to her trusted maid, and her very telling reference to ‘claim-jumping’—which in miners’ terms means taking possession of something another person has a prior right to—the entire situation became absolutely clear. She had left with a man, and that man was either a lover or a previous husband—with the strong likelihood being the latter.” “And how on earth did you manage to find them?” I inquired. “It might have been difficult, but my friend Lestrade held information whose value he didn’t recognize. The initials were, of course, crucial, but even more important was knowing that he had paid his bill at one of the most exclusive London hotels within a week. “How did you deduce it was ‘select’?” I asked. “By the select prices. Eight shillings for a bed and eightpence for a glass of sherry indicate one of the city’s most expensive establishments. There are not many in London charging those rates. At the second hotel I checked on Northumberland Avenue, examining the register revealed that Francis H. Moulton, an American gentleman, had checked out just the day before. Reviewing the entries against his name, I found the identical charges I had seen on the duplicate bill. His mail was to be forwarded to 226 Gordon Square; so, I went there and was fortunate enough to find the couple at home. I took the liberty of offering them some paternal advice and suggested that it would be best for everyone involved if they clarified their situation, particularly to Lord St. Simon and the public. I invited them to meet him here, and as you observed, I ensured he kept the appointment.” “But without much success,” I commented. “His behavior was certainly not very pleasant.” “Ah, Watson,” said Holmes, smiling, “perhaps you wouldn’t be very pleasant either if, after all the effort of courting and marrying, you found yourself instantly deprived of both a wife and a fortune. I think we can judge Lord St. Simon quite leniently and be thankful that we are unlikely ever to find ourselves in such a predicament. Pull up your chair and hand me my violin, for the only remaining challenge is how to occupy ourselves during these bleak autumn evenings.”",
          "paraphrase_gpt-4.1-2025-04-14": "Lord St. Simon remained stiff and aloof, listening to the long account with a stern expression and tight lips. \"If you don't mind,\" he said, \"I don't normally discuss my private affairs so openly.\" \"So, you won't forgive me? Not even shake hands before I leave?\" she asked. \"I will, if it makes you happy,\" he replied, offering his hand in a cold manner. Holmes then invited him to join the others for a friendly supper, but Lord St. Simon refused, stating, \"I think that's asking too much. I may have to accept what has happened, but I can't pretend to be cheerful about it. With your permission, I will say good night now.\" With that, he bowed to everyone and left. Holmes then turned to Mr. Moulton, expressing his pleasure in meeting an American and suggesting that, despite past political mistakes, he hoped both countries would one day be united under a shared flag.\n\nOnce the visitors had left, Holmes remarked that the case was interesting because it illustrated how straightforward the truth could be, even if it seemed inexplicable at first. The lady's account was logical, but the outcome must have seemed very strange to someone like Mr. Lestrade. When asked if he had made any errors, Holmes explained that two facts were clear from the start: the woman had willingly married, but changed her mind soon after arriving home. Therefore, something significant must have happened earlier that day. Since she was always with the groom, she probably hadn't spoken to anyone, but perhaps she had seen someone. Given her short time in England, it was likely an American who could influence her so much. This person might be a lover or a husband; considering her unusual past, Holmes suspected the latter. Lord St. Simon's story about a mysterious man in the pew, the bride’s change in demeanor, the dropped bouquet as an excuse for a note, her trusted maid, and her comment about 'claim-jumping'—a miner's term for taking something already claimed—made everything clear. The woman had left with a man, likely her husband from before.\n\nHolmes explained that he found them thanks to Lestrade, who unknowingly had useful evidence: the man’s initials and a bill settled at a high-end hotel. The expensive charges narrowed down the possibilities, and at the second fancy hotel he checked, he discovered Francis H. Moulton, an American gentleman, had just left. His mail was being forwarded to 226 Gordon Square, so Holmes went there and found the reunited couple at home. He advised them to clarify their situation with the public and Lord St. Simon. Holmes invited them to meet with Lord St. Simon, ensuring he attended.\n\nI pointed out that the meeting hadn't ended well, as Lord St. Simon hadn't behaved graciously. Holmes replied, with a smile, that it was understandable; after going through so much to marry, losing both his wife and fortune in an instant would be hard on anyone. We should be sympathetic and count ourselves lucky never to face such a situation. Then Holmes asked me to join him and hand him his violin, noting that our only remaining problem was how to pass the dreary autumn evenings."

It seems rather sad that his relatives should allow him to come out alone.”\nMy friend rose lazily from his armchair and stood with his hands in the pockets of his dressing-gown, looking over my shoulder. It was a bright, crisp February morning, and the snow of the day before still lay deep upon the ground, shimmering brightly in the wintry sun. Down the centre of Baker Street it had been ploughed into a brown crumbly band by the traffic, but at either side and on the heaped-up edges of the footpaths it still lay as white as when it fell. The grey pavement had been cleaned and scraped, but was still dangerously slippery, so that there were fewer passengers than usual. Indeed, from the direction of the Metropolitan Station no one was coming save the single gentleman whose eccentric conduct had drawn my attention.\nHe was a man of about fifty, tall, portly, and imposing, with a massive, strongly marked face and a commanding figure. He was dressed in a sombre yet rich style, in black frock-coat, shining hat, neat brown gaiters, and well-cut pearl-grey trousers. Yet his actions were in absurd contrast to the dignity of his dress and features, for he was running hard, with occasional little springs, such as a weary man gives who is little accustomed to set any tax upon his legs. As he ran he jerked his hands up and down, waggled his head, and writhed his face into the most extraordinary contortions.\n“What on earth can be the matter with him?” I asked. “He is looking up at the numbers of the houses.”\n“I believe that he is coming here,” said Holmes, rubbing his hands.\n“Here?”\n“Yes; I rather think he is coming to consult me professionally. I think that I recognise the symptoms. Ha! did I not tell you?” As he spoke, the man, puffing and blowing, rushed at our door and pulled at our bell until the whole house resounded with the clanging.\nA few moments later he was in our room, still puffing, still gesticulating, but with so fixed a look of grief and despair in his eyes that our smiles were turned in an instant to horror and pity. For a while he could not get his words out, but swayed his body and plucked at his hair like one who has been driven to the extreme limits of his reason. Then, suddenly springing to his feet, he beat his head against the wall with such force that we both rushed upon him and tore him away to the centre of the room. Sherlock Holmes pushed him down into the easy-chair and, sitting beside him, patted his hand and chatted with him in the easy, soothing tones which he knew so well how to employ.",
          "paraphrase_gemini-2.5-flash-preview-04-17": "One morning, standing at our bay window and observing people in the street below, I remarked to Holmes about a man approaching, suggesting he appeared mentally disturbed and that it seemed regrettable his family allowed him out unaccompanied. My friend got up slowly from his chair, came to the window, and looked over my shoulder, his hands in the pockets of his dressing-gown. It was a clear, cold February morning, and the heavy snow from the day before covered the ground, sparkling under the winter sun. Traffic had churned the snow in the middle of Baker Street into a muddy mess, but it lay pristine white on the sidewalks and bordering snowdrifts. The pavement, though cleared, was still treacherous, resulting in fewer pedestrians than usual. Indeed, the only person coming from the direction of the Metropolitan Station was the very man whose odd behavior had caught my eye. He was a substantial man of about fifty, with an impressive, strongly defined face and a commanding presence, dressed formally in a dark frock-coat, shiny hat, neat brown gaiters, and elegant grey trousers. However, his actions were bizarrely at odds with his dignified appearance; he was running awkwardly, giving small hops like someone unused to such exertion, jerking his arms, shaking his head, and making intensely contorted facial expressions. \"What could possibly be wrong with him?\" I asked, noticing he was looking closely at the house numbers. Holmes, rubbing his hands together, said, \"I believe he is coming here.\" \"Here?\" I questioned. \"Yes,\" he replied, \"I rather suspect he's coming to seek my professional assistance. I think I recognize these signs. Ah, you see?\" Just as he finished speaking, the man, panting and gasping, lunged at our front door and pulled the bell repeatedly and forcefully until the entire house echoed with the noise. A few moments later, he was in our room, still short of breath and gesturing, but the profound grief and despair in his eyes instantly changed our smiles to feelings of horror and pity. For a moment, he couldn't speak, swaying and pulling at his hair like someone driven to the edge of sanity. Then, suddenly springing up, he hit his head against the wall so violently that we both rushed forward, pulling him back into the room's center. Sherlock Holmes guided him into an easy chair and, sitting by his side, gently patted his hand, speaking to him in the calming, soothing manner he knew so well how to use.",
          "paraphrase_gpt-4.1-2025-04-14": "One morning, as I stood by our bay window looking out onto the street, I remarked to Holmes, \"There goes a madman. It's unfortunate that his family has let him wander by himself.\" Holmes got up slowly from his chair and, with his hands in the pockets of his dressing gown, looked out over my shoulder. The morning was bright and clear; the snow from the day before covered the ground, sparkling under the winter sun. The center of Baker Street had a rough, brown track from the traffic, but elsewhere the snow was fresh, white, and piled up along the edges of the sidewalks. Though the pavement had been cleaned, it was still quite slippery, so few people were about. In fact, only one man was approaching from the direction of the Metropolitan Station—the peculiar figure that had caught my attention. He appeared to be about fifty, tall and stout, with a striking face and an air of authority. He wore an elegant but somber outfit: a black frock coat, shiny hat, neat brown gaiters, and sleek pearl-grey trousers. Despite his dignified appearance, his behavior was odd—he was running awkwardly, occasionally leaping, moving his arms up and down, shaking his head, and making strange faces. \"What could be wrong with him?\" I wondered aloud. \"He's checking the house numbers.\" \"I'm pretty sure he's coming here,\" Holmes replied, rubbing his hands. \"Here?\" I questioned. \"Yes, I suspect he needs my professional advice. I recognize the signs. There—see, I was right!\" Just then, the man dashed up to our door, rang the bell violently, making quite a noise. Moments later, he burst into our room, still out of breath and making wild gestures, but with such a look of sorrow and despair that our initial amusement gave way to concern. For a while, he couldn't speak, instead wringing his hands and pulling at his hair in a display of utter desperation. Suddenly, he sprang up and started banging his head against the wall so forcefully that Holmes and I had to restrain him. Holmes guided him into an armchair and comforted him with gentle words, using his well-practiced soothing manner."

Pray wait until you have recovered yourself, and then I shall be most happy to look into any little problem which you may submit to me.”\nThe man sat for a minute or more with a heaving chest, fighting against his emotion. Then he passed his handkerchief over his brow, set his lips tight, and turned his face towards us.\n“No doubt you think me mad?” said he.\n“I see that you have had some great trouble,” responded Holmes.\n“God knows I have!—a trouble which is enough to unseat my reason, so sudden and so terrible is it. Public disgrace I might have faced, although I am a man whose character has never yet borne a stain. Private affliction also is the lot of every man; but the two coming together, and in so frightful a form, have been enough to shake my very soul. Besides, it is not I alone. The very noblest in the land may suffer unless some way be found out of this horrible affair.”\n“Pray compose yourself, sir,” said Holmes, “and let me have a clear account of who you are and what it is that has befallen you.”\n“My name,” answered our visitor, “is probably familiar to your ears. I am Alexander Holder, of the banking firm of Holder & Stevenson, of Threadneedle Street.”\nThe name was indeed well known to us as belonging to the senior partner in the second largest private banking concern in the City of London. What could have happened, then, to bring one of the foremost citizens of London to this most pitiable pass? We waited, all curiosity, until with another effort he braced himself to tell his story.\n“I feel that time is of value,” said he; “that is why I hastened here when the police inspector suggested that I should secure your co-operation. I came to Baker Street by the Underground and hurried from there on foot, for the cabs go slowly through this snow. That is why I was so out of breath, for I am a man who takes very little exercise. I feel better now, and I will put the facts before you as shortly and yet as clearly as I can.\n“It is, of course, well known to you that in a successful banking business as much depends upon our being able to find remunerative investments for our funds as upon our increasing our connection and the number of our depositors. One of our most lucrative means of laying out money is in the shape of loans, where the security is unimpeachable. We have done a good deal in this direction during the last few years, and there are many noble families to whom we have advanced large sums upon the security of their pictures, libraries, or plate.\n“Yesterday morning I was seated in my office at the bank when a card was brought in to me by one of the clerks. I started when I saw the name, for it was that of none other than—well, perhaps even to you I had better say no more than that it was a name which is a household word all over the earth—one of the highest, noblest, most exalted names in England. I was overwhelmed by the honour and attempted, when he entered, to say so, but he plunged at once into business with the air of a man who wishes to hurry quickly through a disagreeable task.\n“‘Mr. Holder,’ said he, ‘I have been informed that you are in the habit of advancing money.’\n“‘The firm does so when the security is good.’ I answered.\n“‘It is absolutely essential to me,’ said he, ‘that I should have £ 50,000 at once. I could, of course, borrow so trifling a sum ten times over from my friends, but I much prefer to make it a matter of business and to carry out that business myself. In my position you can readily understand that it is unwise to place one’s self under obligations.’\n“‘For how long, may I ask, do you want this sum?’ I asked.\n“‘Next Monday I have a large sum due to me, and I shall then most certainly repay what you advance, with whatever interest you think it right to charge. But it is very essential to me that the money should be paid at once.’\n“‘I should be happy to advance it without further parley from my own private purse,’ said I, ‘were it not that the strain would be rather more than it could bear. If, on the other hand, I am to do it in the name of the firm, then in justice to my partner I must insist that, even in your case, every businesslike precaution should be taken.’\n“‘I should much prefer to have it so,’ said he, raising up a square, black morocco case which he had laid beside his chair. ‘You have doubtless heard of the Beryl Coronet?’\n“‘One of the most precious public possessions of the empire,’ said I.\n“‘Precisely.’ He opened the case, and there, imbedded in soft, flesh-coloured velvet, lay the magnificent piece of jewellery which he had named. ‘There are thirty-nine enormous beryls,’ said he, ‘and the price of the gold chasing is incalculable. The lowest estimate would put the worth of the coronet at double the sum which I have asked. I am prepared to leave it with you as my security.’\n“I took the precious case into my hands and looked in some perplexity from it to my illustrious client.\n“‘You doubt its value?’ he asked.\n“‘Not at all. I only doubt—’\n“‘The propriety of my leaving it. You may set your mind at rest about that. I should not dream of doing so were it not absolutely certain that I should be able in four days to reclaim it. It is a pure matter of form. Is the security sufficient?’\n“‘Ample.’\n“‘You understand, Mr. Holder, that I am giving you a strong proof of the confidence which I have in you, founded upon all that I have heard of you. I rely upon you not only to be discreet and to refrain from all gossip upon the matter but, above all, to preserve this coronet with every possible precaution because I need not say that a great public scandal would be caused if any harm were to befall it. Any injury to it would be almost as serious as its complete loss, for there are no beryls in the world to match these, and it would be impossible to replace them. I leave it with you, however, with every confidence, and I shall call for it in person on Monday morning.’\n“Seeing that my client was anxious to leave, I said no more but, calling for my cashier, I ordered him to pay over fifty £ 1000 notes. When I was alone once more, however, with the precious case lying upon the table in front of me, I could not but think with some misgivings of the immense responsibility which it entailed upon me. There could be no doubt that, as it was a national possession, a horrible scandal would ensue if any misfortune should occur to it. I already regretted having ever consented to take charge of it. However, it was too late to alter the matter now, so I locked it up in my private safe and turned once more to my work.\n“When evening came I felt that it would be an imprudence to leave so precious a thing in the office behind me. Bankers’ safes had been forced before now, and why should not mine be? If so, how terrible would be the position in which I should find myself! I determined, therefore, that for the next few days I would always carry the case backward and forward with me, so that it might never be really out of my reach. With this intention, I called a cab and drove out to my house at Streatham, carrying the jewel with me. I did not breathe freely until I had taken it upstairs and locked it in the bureau of my dressing-room.\n“And now a word as to my household, Mr. Holmes, for I wish you to thoroughly understand the situation. My groom and my page sleep out of the house, and may be set aside altogether. I have three maid-servants who have been with me a number of years and whose absolute reliability is quite above suspicion. Another, Lucy Parr, the second waiting-maid, has only been in my service a few months. She came with an excellent character, however, and has always given me satisfaction. She is a very pretty girl and has attracted admirers who have occasionally hung about the place. That is the only drawback which we have found to her, but we believe her to be a thoroughly good girl in every way.\n“So much for the servants. My family itself is so small that it will not take me long to describe it. I am a widower and have an only son, Arthur. He has been a disappointment to me, Mr. Holmes—a grievous disappointment. I have no doubt that I am myself to blame. People tell me that I have spoiled him. Very likely I have. When my dear wife died I felt that he was all I had to love. I could not bear to see the smile fade even for a moment from his face. I have never denied him a wish. Perhaps it would have been better for both of us had I been sterner, but I meant it for the best.\n“It was naturally my intention that he should succeed me in my business, but he was not of a business turn. He was wild, wayward, and, to speak the truth, I could not trust him in the handling of large sums of money. When he was young he became a member of an aristocratic club, and there, having charming manners, he was soon the intimate of a number of men with long purses and expensive habits. He learned to play heavily at cards and to squander money on the turf, until he had again and again to come to me and implore me to give him an advance upon his allowance, that he might settle his debts of honour. He tried more than once to break away from the dangerous company which he was keeping, but each time the influence of his friend, Sir George Burnwell, was enough to draw him back again.\n“And, indeed, I could not wonder that such a man as Sir George Burnwell should gain an influence over him, for he has frequently brought him to my house, and I have found myself that I could hardly resist the fascination of his manner. He is older than Arthur, a man of the world to his finger-tips, one who had been everywhere, seen everything, a brilliant talker, and a man of great personal beauty. Yet when I think of him in cold blood, far away from the glamour of his presence, I am convinced from his cynical speech and the look which I have caught in his eyes that he is one who should be deeply distrusted. So I think, and so, too, thinks my little Mary, who has a woman’s quick insight into character.\n“And now there is only she to be described. She is my niece; but when my brother died five years ago and left her alone in the world I adopted her, and have looked upon her ever since as my daughter. She is a sunbeam in my house—sweet, loving, beautiful, a wonderful manager and housekeeper, yet as tender and quiet and gentle as a woman could be. She is my right hand. I do not know what I could do without her. In only one matter has she ever gone against my wishes. Twice my boy has asked her to marry him, for he loves her devotedly, but each time she has refused him.",

Please rest for a moment, and then I’ll be glad to examine whatever issue you wish to present.” The visitor sat silently for a minute, struggling with his emotions. He wiped his brow, firmed his lips, and finally faced us. “You probably think I’m crazy, don’t you?” he asked. Holmes replied, “I can see you’ve suffered a serious distress.”\n\n“God knows that’s true!—it’s a problem so sudden and dreadful that it could unhinge anyone. I might have managed public shame, and although I’ve always had a good reputation, I know everyone experiences private tragedy, too. But facing both at once, in this terrible form, has shaken me to the core. And I’m not the only one at risk. Some of the noblest people in England could be in danger unless a solution is found.”\n\n“Please, calm yourself,” said Holmes, “and tell me clearly who you are and what has happened to you.”\n\nThe visitor introduced himself: “You may know my name. I am Alexander Holder, of Holder & Stevenson, the banking firm on Threadneedle Street.” We were indeed familiar with the name; he was the senior partner of London’s second largest private bank. What disaster could have brought such an important gentleman to this desperate state? We waited anxiously as he gathered himself to begin his account.\n\n“I know time is important,” he said, “which is why I came so quickly after the police inspector advised that you might help me. I took the Underground to Baker Street and hurried on foot, since cabs are slowed by the snow. That’s why I was breathless when I arrived—I rarely exercise. Now that I’m calmer, I’ll tell you the facts as briefly and clearly as possible.\n\n“You know, of course, that in banking it’s crucial to find good investments, just as it is to grow our client base. One of our most profitable activities is making loans against very secure collateral. We have done this frequently, often lending large sums to noble families who offer valuable items such as art, libraries, or silver as security.\n\n“Yesterday morning, while in my office, a clerk brought me a visitor’s card. I recognized the name instantly—it was someone whose name is known throughout the world, one of England’s highest and most respected individuals. I was honored, but he immediately got down to business, appearing eager to finish an unpleasant errand quickly.\n\n‘Mr. Holder,’ he began, ‘I hear you make loans.’\n\n‘I do, if the collateral is good,’ I replied.\n\n‘It is essential for me to have £50,000 immediately. I could easily borrow this small sum from friends, but would prefer it to be a business transaction and to handle it personally. In my position, it would be unwise to incur obligations to others.’\n\n‘How long do you need the money?’ I asked.\n\n‘By Monday, I will have funds to repay you with whatever interest you choose, but I must have the loan at once.’\n\n‘I would lend it from my own purse,’ I said, ‘if it wouldn’t overextend me. But if I use my firm’s funds, I must follow normal protocols, even for you.’\n\n‘That is my preference,’ he said, holding up a square black leather case he’d brought. ‘You know the Beryl Coronet?’\n\n‘One of the country’s greatest treasures,’ I agreed.\n\n‘Exactly.’ He opened the case, revealing a magnificent crown resting on pale velvet. ‘It holds thirty-nine large beryl gems and priceless goldwork. Its lowest valuation is twice the amount I ask. I am willing to give it as collateral.’\n\nI took the case, glancing from the jewel to my distinguished client, uncertainly.\n\n‘You doubt its value?’ He asked.\n\n‘Not at all. I only question—’\n\n‘Whether it’s proper to leave it as collateral. Don’t worry—I would not do so unless I were certain I could redeem it in four days. This is merely a formality. Is the security sufficient?’\n\n‘More than sufficient.’\n\n‘This should illustrate the trust I have in you, Mr. Holder, based on your excellent reputation. I trust you not to gossip about this affair, and above all, to keep the coronet safe, as a public scandal could result if anything happened to it—damage would be nearly as disastrous as total loss, since its beryls are unique. Still, I am leaving it with you confidently, and will collect it myself on Monday.’\n\nSeeing he wished to go, I said no more. I summoned the cashier and instructed him to provide fifty £1,000 notes. Alone again with the coronet, I was anxious about the huge responsibility I had accepted. If anything happened to this national heirloom the scandal would be enormous. I already regretted agreeing to take it, but it was too late now. I secured it in my private safe and returned to my work.\n\nThat evening, I realized it would be unwise to leave so valuable an item at the office overnight. Safes, even in banks, had been broken into before. Imagine what would happen if mine was! I resolved to keep the coronet with me at all times until it was returned. So I called for a cab, took it home to Streatham, and locked it in my dressing-room bureau. Only then could I relax.\n\n\"Now, let me describe my household so you fully understand the situation. My groom and page both sleep elsewhere and can be ignored. I have three maids who have served me reliably for years. The only new servant is Lucy Parr, the second maid, in my employ just a few months. She came with good references and has been satisfactory, though her attractiveness has drawn some admirers who linger around the home. That’s her only fault; she seems otherwise trustworthy.\n\n\"As for my family, it is quite small. I am a widower with one son, Arthur, who, I’m sorry to say, has been a profound disappointment. Perhaps it’s my fault—people say I’ve spoiled him. When my wife died, he was the only one left for me to love, and I couldn’t refuse him anything. It may have done us both harm.\n\n\"I hoped he would follow me in business, but he was not inclined that way. He developed expensive tastes and friendships at an upper-class club, gambling and spending recklessly, often coming to me for money to settle his debts of honor. Though he sometimes tried to reform, he was always drawn back by his friend Sir George Burnwell.\n\n\"I almost understand the appeal; Sir George is charming, worldly, handsome, a brilliant conversationalist—no wonder he influences my son. But from what I’ve observed when thinking clearly, I suspect he is deeply untrustworthy, something my niece Mary also senses.\n\n\"Mary is my late brother’s daughter, but after he died five years ago, I took her in and think of her as my own child. She is cheerful, caring, capable, and indispensable to me—a joy in all ways. Only once has she opposed me: my son has twice asked her to marry him, but both times she has refused.”"

Lucy Parr, who had brought in the coffee, had, I am sure, left the room; but I cannot swear that the door was closed. Mary and Arthur were much interested and wished to see the famous coronet, but I thought it better not to disturb it.\n“‘Where have you put it?’ asked Arthur.\n“‘In my own bureau.’\n“‘Well, I hope to goodness the house won’t be burgled during the night.’ said he.\n“‘It is locked up,’ I answered.\n“‘Oh, any old key will fit that bureau. When I was a youngster I have opened it myself with the key of the box-room cupboard.’\n“He often had a wild way of talking, so that I thought little of what he said. He followed me to my room, however, that night with a very grave face.\n“‘Look here, dad,’ said he with his eyes cast down, ‘can you let me have £ 200?’\n“‘No, I cannot!’ I answered sharply. ‘I have been far too generous with you in money matters.’\n“‘You have been very kind,’ said he, ‘but I must have this money, or else I can never show my face inside the club again.’\n“‘And a very good thing, too!’ I cried.\n“‘Yes, but you would not have me leave it a dishonoured man,’ said he. ‘I could not bear the disgrace. I must raise the money in some way, and if you will not let me have it, then I must try other means.’\n“I was very angry, for this was the third demand during the month. ‘You shall not have a farthing from me,’ I cried, on which he bowed and left the room without another word.\n“When he was gone I unlocked my bureau, made sure that my treasure was safe, and locked it again. Then I started to go round the house to see that all was secure—a duty which I usually leave to Mary but which I thought it well to perform myself that night. As I came down the stairs I saw Mary herself at the side window of the hall, which she closed and fastened as I approached.\n“‘Tell me, dad,’ said she, looking, I thought, a little disturbed, ‘did you give Lucy, the maid, leave to go out to-night?’\n“‘Certainly not.’\n“‘She came in just now by the back door. I have no doubt that she has only been to the side gate to see someone, but I think that it is hardly safe and should be stopped.’\n“‘You must speak to her in the morning, or I will if you prefer it. Are you sure that everything is fastened?’\n“‘Quite sure, dad.’\n“‘Then, good-night.’ I kissed her and went up to my bedroom again, where I was soon asleep.\n“I am endeavouring to tell you everything, Mr. Holmes, which may have any bearing upon the case, but I beg that you will question me upon any point which I do not make clear.”\n“On the contrary, your statement is singularly lucid.”\n“I come to a part of my story now in which I should wish to be particularly so. I am not a very heavy sleeper, and the anxiety in my mind tended, no doubt, to make me even less so than usual. About two in the morning, then, I was awakened by some sound in the house. It had ceased ere I was wide awake, but it had left an impression behind it as though a window had gently closed somewhere. I lay listening with all my ears. Suddenly, to my horror, there was a distinct sound of footsteps moving softly in the next room. I slipped out of bed, all palpitating with fear, and peeped round the corner of my dressing-room door.\n“‘Arthur!’ I screamed, ‘you villain! you thief! How dare you touch that coronet?’\n“The gas was half up, as I had left it, and my unhappy boy, dressed only in his shirt and trousers, was standing beside the light, holding the coronet in his hands. He appeared to be wrenching at it, or bending it with all his strength. At my cry he dropped it from his grasp and turned as pale as death. I snatched it up and examined it. One of the gold corners, with three of the beryls in it, was missing.\n“‘You blackguard!’ I shouted, beside myself with rage. ‘You have destroyed it! You have dishonoured me forever! Where are the jewels which you have stolen?’\n“‘Stolen!’ he cried.\n“‘Yes, thief!’ I roared, shaking him by the shoulder.\n“‘There are none missing. There cannot be any missing,’ said he.\n“‘There are three missing. And you know where they are. Must I call you a liar as well as a thief? Did I not see you trying to tear off another piece?’\n“‘You have called me names enough,’ said he, ‘I will not stand it any longer. I shall not say another word about this business, since you have chosen to insult me. I will leave your house in the morning and make my own way in the world.’\n“‘You shall leave it in the hands of the police!’ I cried half-mad with grief and rage. ‘I shall have this matter probed to the bottom.’\n“‘You shall learn nothing from me,’ said he with a passion such as I should not have thought was in his nature. ‘If you choose to call the police, let the police find what they can.’\n“By this time the whole house was astir, for I had raised my voice in my anger. Mary was the first to rush into my room, and, at the sight of the coronet and of Arthur’s face, she read the whole story and, with a scream, fell down senseless on the ground. I sent the housemaid for the police and put the investigation into their hands at once. When the inspector and a constable entered the house, Arthur, who had stood sullenly with his arms folded, asked me whether it was my intention to charge him with theft. I answered that it had ceased to be a private matter, but had become a public one, since the ruined coronet was national property. I was determined that the law should have its way in everything.\n“‘At least,’ said he, ‘you will not have me arrested at once. It would be to your advantage as well as mine if I might leave the house for five minutes.’\n“‘That you may get away, or perhaps that you may conceal what you have stolen,’ said I. And then, realising the dreadful position in which I was placed, I implored him to remember that not only my honour but that of one who was far greater than I was at stake; and that he threatened to raise a scandal which would convulse the nation. He might avert it all if he would but tell me what he had done with the three missing stones.\n“‘You may as well face the matter,’ said I; ‘you have been caught in the act, and no confession could make your guilt more heinous. If you but make such reparation as is in your power, by telling us where the beryls are, all shall be forgiven and forgotten.’\n“‘Keep your forgiveness for those who ask for it,’ he answered, turning away from me with a sneer. I saw that he was too hardened for any words of mine to influence him. There was but one way for it. I called in the inspector and gave him into custody. A search was made at once not only of his person but of his room and of every portion of the house where he could possibly have concealed the gems; but no trace of them could be found, nor would the wretched boy open his mouth for all our persuasions and our threats. This morning he was removed to a cell, and I, after going through all the police formalities, have hurried round to you to implore you to use your skill in unravelling the matter. The police have openly confessed that they can at present make nothing of it. You may go to any expense which you think necessary. I have already offered a reward of £ 1000. My God, what shall I do! I have lost my honour, my gems, and my son in one night. Oh, what shall I do!”",
          "paraphrase_gemini-2.5-flash-preview-04-17": "I believe she was the only person who could have guided him toward a better life, and that getting married might have completely transformed his existence. But tragically, it's now too late – permanently too late! 'Mr. Holmes,' he continued, 'you are aware of the people residing in my home, and I will proceed with my unfortunate tale. That evening after supper, while having coffee in the sitting room, I recounted my experience to Arthur and Mary, mentioning the valuable item we were safeguarding under our roof, though without revealing my client's name. Lucy Parr, the maid who served the coffee, had, I'm certain, left the room, but I can't definitively say the door was shut. Mary and Arthur were quite interested and expressed a desire to see the famous coronet, but I decided it was best not to disturb it. 'Where have you put it?' Arthur inquired. 'In my personal cabinet,' I replied. 'Well, let's hope the house isn't broken into tonight,' he commented. 'It is locked,' I assured him. 'Oh, any old key will work for that cabinet. When I was young, I used the key to the box-room cupboard to open it myself.' He often spoke rather carelessly, so I didn't give much thought to his words. However, he did follow me to my room that night, looking very serious. 'Listen, Dad,' he said, looking down, 'could you lend me £200?' 'No, I cannot!' I retorted sharply. 'I've already been far too generous with money for you.' 'You've been very kind,' he said, 'but I absolutely need this money, or I can never show my face at the club again.' 'And that would be a very good thing!' I exclaimed. 'Yes, but you wouldn't want me to leave it having been disgraced,' he argued. 'I couldn't bear the dishonor. I have to find a way to get the money, and if you won't provide it, then I must explore other options.' I was very upset, as this was his third request that month. 'You will not get a penny from me,' I declared, at which point he bowed and left the room without another word. After he left, I unlocked my cabinet, confirmed the treasure was safe, and locked it again. Then, I began inspecting the house to ensure everything was secured – a task I usually leave to Mary, but which I felt compelled to do myself that night. As I descended the stairs, I saw Mary herself by the side window in the hall, which she closed and fastened as I approached. 'Tell me, Dad,' she said, looking a bit troubled, I thought, 'did you permit Lucy, the maid, to go out tonight?' 'Certainly not,' I answered. 'She just came in through the back door. I'm sure she only went to the side gate to see someone, but I really don't think it's safe and it ought to stop.' 'You must speak to her tomorrow morning, or I will if you prefer. Are you certain everything is fastened?' 'Absolutely sure, Dad.' 'Then, goodnight.' I kissed her and returned to my bedroom, where I soon fell asleep. I am trying my best to recount every detail, Mr. Holmes, that might be relevant to the case, but I urge you to question me on any point that is unclear. 'On the contrary,' Holmes said, 'your account is remarkably clear.' 'I now come to a part of my story where I want to be especially precise. I am not a particularly deep sleeper, and the worry on my mind undoubtedly made me sleep even lighter than usual. So, around two in the morning, I was startled awake by a noise in the house. It had stopped by the time I was fully conscious, but it left the impression that a window had been gently closed somewhere. I lay there, listening intently. Suddenly, to my horror, I heard distinct footsteps moving softly in the adjacent room. Trembling with fear, I slipped out of bed and cautiously peered around the edge of my dressing-room door. 'Arthur!' I cried, 'you wretch! You thief! How dare you touch that coronet?' The gas lamp was turned halfway up, just as I had left it, and my unfortunate son, clad only in his shirt and trousers, was standing beside the light, holding the coronet. He seemed to be trying to twist it or bend it with all his might. At my shout, he dropped it and turned deathly pale. I quickly picked it up and examined it. One of the golden points, containing three of the beryls, was missing. 'You scoundrel!' I yelled, consumed by fury. 'You've ruined it! You have shamed me forever! Where are the jewels you've stolen?' 'Stolen!' he exclaimed. 'Yes, thief!' I roared, grabbing his shoulder and shaking him. 'None are missing. There can't be any missing,' he insisted. 'Three are missing. And you know exactly where they are. Must I call you a liar in addition to being a thief? Did I not see you attempting to tear off another piece?' 'You have insulted me enough,' he replied, 'I will not tolerate it any further. I will not say another word about this matter, since you have chosen to abuse me. I will leave your house tomorrow morning and make my own way in the world.' 'You will leave it in the custody of the police!' I cried, half-crazed with sorrow and anger. 'I will see this matter investigated thoroughly.' 'You will learn nothing from me,' he said with an intensity I wouldn't have thought was in his character. 'If you choose to call the police, let the police find what they can.' By this time, the entire household was awake, as I had raised my voice in anger. Mary was the first to rush into my room, and upon seeing the coronet and Arthur's face, she instantly understood everything and, with a scream, fainted to the ground. I sent the housemaid to fetch the police and immediately handed the investigation over to them. When the inspector and a constable entered the house, Arthur, who had been standing sullenly with his arms crossed, asked if I intended to charge him with theft. I replied that it was no longer a private affair, but a public one, given that the damaged coronet belonged to the nation. I was determined that justice should follow its course. 'At least,' he said, 'you won't have me arrested immediately. It would benefit both of us if I could leave the house for five minutes.' 'So you can escape, or perhaps hide what you've stolen,' I countered. Then, realizing the dreadful situation I was in, I pleaded with him to remember that not only my honor, but that of someone far more important than myself, was at stake; and that he was about to cause a scandal that would rock the nation. He could prevent it all if he would just tell me what he had done with the three missing stones. 'You might as well face it,' I said; 'you were caught in the act, and no confession could make your guilt any worse. If you simply make amends as best you can, by telling us where the beryls are, everything will be forgiven and forgotten.' 'Keep your forgiveness for those who ask for it,' he responded, turning away from me with a sneer. I saw that he was too stubborn for any words of mine to affect him. There was only one option left. I called in the inspector and handed him over for arrest. A search was immediately conducted, not only of his person but of his room and every other part of the house where he might have hidden the gems; but no trace of them could be found, nor would the wretched boy speak despite all our pleas and threats. This morning he was moved to a cell, and I, after completing all the necessary police procedures, have rushed here to you to implore you to use your expertise in solving this mystery. The police have openly admitted they are currently baffled. You are authorized to incur any necessary expense you deem appropriate. I have already offered a reward of £1000. My God, what am I to do! I have lost my honor, my jewels, and my son all in one night. Oh, what am I to do!",
          "paraphrase_gpt-4.1-2025-04-14": "I believe that if anyone could have influenced him to improve, it would have been her, and marriage might have transformed his life, but now, unfortunately, it is irreversibly too late. Now, Mr. Holmes, you know the people who reside in my house, so I will continue with my unfortunate tale. That night, after dinner, while having coffee in the drawing-room, I recounted to Arthur and Mary my recent experience and mentioned the valuable item in our home, but did not disclose my client's identity. Lucy Parr, the maid who served the coffee, had apparently left, though I can't guarantee the door was shut. Mary and Arthur were very interested and wanted to see the coronet, but I decided not to disturb it. Arthur asked where I had put it, and I replied that it was in my bureau. He remarked that he hoped the house wouldn’t be burgled, to which I assured him it was locked up. He joked that any old key could open that bureau since he had done so when younger with another key. I didn’t pay much attention, as he often talked that way. However, he followed me to my room that night with a serious expression and asked if I could lend him £200. I refused, saying I had already been generous with him. He pleaded, saying he needed the money or he’d face disgrace at his club, but I insisted he would get nothing more from me. Angrily, he left the room. After he was gone, I checked my bureau to ensure the coronet was safe and went around the house to secure everything, a task usually done by Mary. On my way down the stairs, I saw Mary closing the hall window. She asked if I had given Lucy permission to go out, and I said no. She mentioned seeing Lucy return through the back door and suggested that it wasn’t safe to permit this. I told her to speak to Lucy in the morning or I would do it. She assured me everything was secured, so I wished her goodnight and went to bed. I am trying to give you all the relevant information, Mr. Holmes, but please do ask about anything that is unclear. Holmes replied that my account was very clear. I came to the part of my story I want to explain precisely: I am a light sleeper, and that night, anxiety made me sleep even less. Around two in the morning, I was awakened by a noise that sounded as though a window had gently closed. I lay listening, and then, to my horror, I heard footsteps in the next room. I got out of bed, anxious, and looked into my dressing-room. There I saw Arthur, standing in shirt and trousers, holding the coronet, apparently trying to bend it. I screamed at him, called him a thief, and demanded to know how he dared touch the coronet. On seeing me, he dropped it and turned pale. I picked up the coronet and found that one of the gold corners, with three beryls, was missing. I accused him furiously of ruining and disgracing me, and asked where the stolen stones were. He denied stealing them and insisted nothing was missing. I insisted that three gems were lost, accused him of lying as well as stealing, and said I saw him trying to break off more. He refused to answer further, said he wouldn't stay in my house, and would leave in the morning. I shouted that I’d hand him to the police and have the matter fully investigated. He replied that I would get nothing from him and that the police should find out what they could. My shouts roused the house, and Mary came running in, fainted at the sight, and fell unconscious. I sent for the police and immediately handed the investigation over to them. When the inspector and constable arrived, Arthur asked if I intended to charge him. I said it was now a public affair, as the coronet was national property. I insisted the law take its course. Arthur asked not to be arrested immediately, but I refused, fearing he would escape or hide the gems. I begged him to consider the consequences, telling him that my own and someone more important’s reputation was at stake, and that he could prevent a national scandal by returning the missing beryls. I told him nothing could increase his guilt, but everything would be forgiven if he admitted where the stones were. He retorted that my forgiveness was pointless, and turned away. Realizing I couldn't persuade him, I called the inspector and gave Arthur into custody. The police searched him, his room, and the entire house, but found no trace of the gems, and Arthur wouldn’t speak despite all our appeals. This morning, he was taken to a cell, and after completing police procedures, I came straight to you, Mr. Holmes, to ask for your help. The police have no leads so far. You may spend whatever is needed—I’ve also offered a £1,000 reward. Dear God, what am I to do? In one night I have lost my honour, my jewels, and my son."

Sir George Burnwell has been several times lately. No one else, I think.”\n“Do you go out much in society?”\n“Arthur does. Mary and I stay at home. We neither of us care for it.”\n“That is unusual in a young girl.”\n“She is of a quiet nature. Besides, she is not so very young. She is four-and-twenty.”\n“This matter, from what you say, seems to have been a shock to her also.”\n“Terrible! She is even more affected than I.”\n“You have neither of you any doubt as to your son’s guilt?”\n“How can we have when I saw him with my own eyes with the coronet in his hands.”\n“I hardly consider that a conclusive proof. Was the remainder of the coronet at all injured?”\n“Yes, it was twisted.”\n“Do you not think, then, that he might have been trying to straighten it?”\n“God bless you! You are doing what you can for him and for me. But it is too heavy a task. What was he doing there at all? If his purpose were innocent, why did he not say so?”\n“Precisely. And if it were guilty, why did he not invent a lie? His silence appears to me to cut both ways. There are several singular points about the case. What did the police think of the noise which awoke you from your sleep?”\n“They considered that it might be caused by Arthur’s closing his bedroom door.”\n“A likely story! As if a man bent on felony would slam his door so as to wake a household. What did they say, then, of the disappearance of these gems?”\n“They are still sounding the planking and probing the furniture in the hope of finding them.”\n“Have they thought of looking outside the house?”\n“Yes, they have shown extraordinary energy. The whole garden has already been minutely examined.”\n“Now, my dear sir,” said Holmes, “is it not obvious to you now that this matter really strikes very much deeper than either you or the police were at first inclined to think? It appeared to you to be a simple case; to me it seems exceedingly complex. Consider what is involved by your theory. You suppose that your son came down from his bed, went, at great risk, to your dressing-room, opened your bureau, took out your coronet, broke off by main force a small portion of it, went off to some other place, concealed three gems out of the thirty-nine, with such skill that nobody can find them, and then returned with the other thirty-six into the room in which he exposed himself to the greatest danger of being discovered. I ask you now, is such a theory tenable?”\n“But what other is there?” cried the banker with a gesture of despair. “If his motives were innocent, why does he not explain them?”\n“It is our task to find that out,” replied Holmes; “so now, if you please, Mr. Holder, we will set off for Streatham together, and devote an hour to glancing a little more closely into details.”\nMy friend insisted upon my accompanying them in their expedition, which I was eager enough to do, for my curiosity and sympathy were deeply stirred by the story to which we had listened. I confess that the guilt of the banker’s son appeared to me to be as obvious as it did to his unhappy father, but still I had such faith in Holmes’ judgment that I felt that there must be some grounds for hope as long as he was dissatisfied with the accepted explanation. He hardly spoke a word the whole way out to the southern suburb, but sat with his chin upon his breast and his hat drawn over his eyes, sunk in the deepest thought. Our client appeared to have taken fresh heart at the little glimpse of hope which had been presented to him, and he even broke into a desultory chat with me over his business affairs.",
          "paraphrase_gemini-2.5-flash-preview-04-17": "For a few minutes, Sherlock Holmes sat quietly, frowning and staring into the fire. He then asked if Mr. Holder had many visitors. Holder replied that only his business partner and family came regularly, along with an occasional friend of Arthur's, specifically mentioning Sir George Burnwell recently. Holmes inquired about their social life. Holder explained that Arthur went out, but he and Mary stayed home as neither of them enjoyed it. Holmes noted this was unusual for a young woman. Holder clarified that Mary was naturally quiet and was twenty-four. Holmes remarked that the incident seemed to have greatly shocked her too, to which Holder agreed, saying she was even more distressed than he was. Holmes then asked if they had any doubt about the son's guilt. Holder responded, asking how they could, since he saw Arthur holding the coronet. Holmes countered that he didn't consider that definite proof and asked if the rest of the coronet was damaged. Holder confirmed it was twisted. Holmes suggested Arthur might have been trying to straighten it. Holder expressed gratitude for the attempt to help them but felt the situation was hopeless, questioning why Arthur was there at all if his intentions were innocent, and why he didn't explain himself. Holmes agreed that Arthur's silence was ambiguous – if guilty, why not invent a story, but if innocent, why say nothing? He pointed out other strange aspects, such as the noise that woke Holder. The police believed it was Arthur closing his bedroom door. Holmes found this implausible, stating a criminal wouldn't make noise to wake everyone. He asked what the police concluded about the missing gems. They were still searching inside the house, checking floors and furniture. Holmes asked if they had considered looking outside. Holder said they had been very thorough, examining the entire garden. Holmes then told Holder it should now be clear that the case was much more complex than either he or the police initially thought. While it seemed simple to Holder, it appeared very intricate to Holmes. He asked Holder to consider the implications of his theory: his son supposedly got out of bed, risked being caught by going to the dressing-room, opened the bureau, took the coronet, forcibly broke off a piece, went elsewhere to hide three gems so skillfully no one could find them, and then returned with the remaining thirty-six to the very place where he was most likely to be discovered. Holmes asked if such a theory was plausible. The banker, throwing up his hands in despair, asked what other theory there could possibly be, given his son's lack of explanation. Holmes replied that their job was to find the truth and proposed that he and Mr. Holder go together to Streatham immediately to examine the details more closely for an hour. I was eager to join them on their trip, as the story had deeply stirred my curiosity and sympathy. I must admit that the banker's son's guilt seemed as clear to me as it did to his distressed father, but I had such confidence in Holmes's judgment that I felt there must be grounds for hope as long as he wasn't satisfied with the apparent explanation. On the journey to the southern suburb, Holmes said almost nothing, sitting with his chin resting on his chest and his hat pulled low, lost in deep thought. Our client seemed to have found renewed optimism from the small glimmer of hope Holmes had offered and even engaged me in some casual conversation about his business.",

The reply was that apart from the partner and his family, and the occasional friend of Arthur’s, only Sir George Burnwell had visited multiple times recently. No one else was mentioned. Holmes inquired if they participated much in social events, to which Arthur did, but Mary and her respondent preferred to stay at home, as neither enjoyed society. Holmes found it peculiar for a young woman, but was told that Mary was reserved and, at twenty-four, not that young. Holmes observed that the recent incident appeared to have greatly distressed her, perhaps even more severely than it did her father. Holmes then questioned whether they doubted their son’s guilt, and the father insisted he could hardly help it since he had seen Arthur with the coronet in his hands. Holmes disagreed that this alone was proof—he asked if the coronet was damaged, and learned that it was bent. Holmes suggested Arthur might have been trying to fix it, but the father was skeptical, wondering why Arthur had not offered an explanation if innocent. Holmes pointed out that his silence could suggest either guilt or innocence, and noted several odd aspects to the case. Holmes asked about the police’s opinion on the noise that woke the household; apparently, they thought it was just Arthur shutting his bedroom door, but Holmes found this unlikely for someone committing a crime. As for the missing gems, the police were still searching the house and grounds. Holmes suggested the case was far more complicated than it first appeared, laying out the implausibility of the current theory: that Arthur left his room, stole and damaged the coronet, successfully hid three gems where they couldn’t be found, then returned the rest, all at great personal risk. He questioned whether such a scenario was likely. The father, desperate, asked what other explanation there could be if Arthur would not defend himself. Holmes replied it was their job to uncover the truth, and proposed traveling to Streatham together to further investigate. Holmes insisted Watson join them, and, though Watson also suspected the son’s guilt, he trusted Holmes’ instincts and hoped for another solution. Holmes stayed mostly silent on the journey, lost in thought, while their client seemed encouraged by Holmes’ involvement and conversed with Watson about his business."

          "text_segment": "A short railway journey and a shorter walk brought us to Fairbank, the modest residence of the great financier.\nFairbank was a good-sized square house of white stone, standing back a little from the road. A double carriage-sweep, with a snow-clad lawn, stretched down in front to two large iron gates which closed the entrance. On the right side was a small wooden thicket, which led into a narrow path between two neat hedges stretching from the road to the kitchen door, and forming the tradesmen’s entrance. On the left ran a lane which led to the stables, and was not itself within the grounds at all, being a public, though little used, thoroughfare. Holmes left us standing at the door and walked slowly all round the house, across the front, down the tradesmen’s path, and so round by the garden behind into the stable lane. So long was he that Mr. Holder and I went into the dining-room and waited by the fire until he should return. We were sitting there in silence when the door opened and a young lady came in. She was rather above the middle height, slim, with dark hair and eyes, which seemed the darker against the absolute pallor of her skin. I do not think that I have ever seen such deadly paleness in a woman’s face. Her lips, too, were bloodless, but her eyes were flushed with crying. As she swept silently into the room she impressed me with a greater sense of grief than the banker had done in the morning, and it was the more striking in her as she was evidently a woman of strong character, with immense capacity for self-restraint. Disregarding my presence, she went straight to her uncle and passed her hand over his head with a sweet womanly caress.\n“You have given orders that Arthur should be liberated, have you not, dad?” she asked.\n“No, no, my girl, the matter must be probed to the bottom.”\n“But I am so sure that he is innocent. You know what woman’s instincts are. I know that he has done no harm and that you will be sorry for having acted so harshly.”\n“Why is he silent, then, if he is innocent?”\n“Who knows? Perhaps because he was so angry that you should suspect him.”\n“How could I help suspecting him, when I actually saw him with the coronet in his hand?”\n“Oh, but he had only picked it up to look at it. Oh, do, do take my word for it that he is innocent. Let the matter drop and say no more. It is so dreadful to think of our dear Arthur in prison!”\n“I shall never let it drop until the gems are found—never, Mary! Your affection for Arthur blinds you as to the awful consequences to me. Far from hushing the thing up, I have brought a gentleman down from London to inquire more deeply into it.”\n“This gentleman?” she asked, facing round to me.\n“No, his friend. He wished us to leave him alone. He is round in the stable lane now.”\n“The stable lane?” She raised her dark eyebrows. “What can he hope to find there? Ah! this, I suppose, is he. I trust, sir, that you will succeed in proving, what I feel sure is the truth, that my cousin Arthur is innocent of this crime.”\n“I fully share your opinion, and I trust, with you, that we may prove it,” returned Holmes, going back to the mat to knock the snow from his shoes. “I believe I have the honour of addressing Miss Mary Holder. Might I ask you a question or two?”\n“Pray do, sir, if it may help to clear this horrible affair up.”\n“You heard nothing yourself last night?”\n“Nothing, until my uncle here began to speak loudly. I heard that, and I came down.”\n“You shut up the windows and doors the night before. Did you fasten all the windows?”\n“Yes.”\n“Were they all fastened this morning?”\n“Yes.”\n“You have a maid who has a sweetheart? I think that you remarked to your uncle last night that she had been out to see him?”\n“Yes, and she was the girl who waited in the drawing-room, and who may have heard uncle’s remarks about the coronet.”\n“I see. You infer that she may have gone out to tell her sweetheart, and that the two may have planned the robbery.”\n“But what is the good of all these vague theories,” cried the banker impatiently, “when I have told you that I saw Arthur with the coronet in his hands?”\n“Wait a little, Mr. Holder. We must come back to that. About this girl, Miss Holder. You saw her return by the kitchen door, I presume?”\n“Yes; when I went to see if the door was fastened for the night I met her slipping in. I saw the man, too, in the gloom.”\n“Do you know him?”\n“Oh, yes! he is the greengrocer who brings our vegetables round. His name is Francis Prosper.”\n“He stood,” said Holmes, “to the left of the door—that is to say, farther up the path than is necessary to reach the door?”\n“Yes, he did.”\n“And he is a man with a wooden leg?”\nSomething like fear sprang up in the young lady’s expressive black eyes. “Why, you are like a magician,” said she. “How do you know that?” She smiled, but there was no answering smile in Holmes’ thin, eager face.\n“I should be very glad now to go upstairs,” said he. “I shall probably wish to go over the outside of the house again. Perhaps I had better take a look at the lower windows before I go up.”\nHe walked swiftly round from one to the other, pausing only at the large one which looked from the hall onto the stable lane. This he opened and made a very careful examination of the sill with his powerful magnifying lens. “Now we shall go upstairs,” said he at last.",
          "paraphrase_gemini-2.5-flash-preview-04-17": "After a brief train ride and a shorter walk, we arrived at Fairbank, the respectable home of the wealthy financier. Fairbank was a substantial square house built of white stone, set back slightly from the road. A dual drive, bordered by a snow-covered lawn, curved down in front to two large iron gates that marked the entrance. To the right was a small wooded area leading to a narrow path lined with neat hedges, which ran from the road to the kitchen door and served as the tradesmen’s entrance. To the left was a lane leading to the stables; this was a public road, though not heavily used, and lay outside the property grounds. Holmes left us at the door and walked slowly around the entire house, crossing the front, going down the tradesmen’s path, and then circling past the garden at the back to the stable lane. He took so long that Mr. Holder and I entered the dining room and waited by the fire for his return. We were sitting there quietly when the door opened and a young woman came in. She was a little taller than average, slender, with dark hair and eyes that appeared even darker against her remarkably pale skin. I don't believe I had ever seen such extreme pallor on a woman's face. Her lips were also colourless, but her eyes were red from crying. As she moved silently into the room, she conveyed a deeper sense of sorrow than the banker had that morning, which was all the more striking because she was clearly a woman of strong will with a great capacity for self-control. Ignoring my presence, she went directly to her uncle and affectionately stroked his head. 'You’ve ordered Arthur to be freed, haven’t you, Dad?' she asked. 'No, no, my dear,' he replied, 'the matter must be investigated thoroughly.' 'But I am certain he is innocent. You know how a woman’s intuition is. I know he did nothing wrong, and you will regret being so harsh.' 'Then why is he silent if he is innocent?' 'Who knows? Perhaps because he was so angry that you suspected him.' 'How could I not suspect him when I literally saw him holding the coronet?' 'Oh, but he had only picked it up to examine it. Please, please, trust me that he is innocent. Just drop it and say no more. It's terrible to think of our dear Arthur in prison!' 'I will never drop it until the jewels are found—never, Mary! Your affection for Arthur blinds you to the dreadful consequences for me. Far from covering it up, I’ve brought a gentleman from London to look into it more deeply.' 'This gentleman?' she asked, turning to me. 'No, his friend,' I said. 'He asked us to leave him alone. He’s in the stable lane right now.' 'The stable lane?' She raised her dark eyebrows. 'What could he possibly hope to find there? Ah! This must be him, I suppose.' Holmes entered just then. 'I hope, sir,' she continued, 'that you will succeed in proving what I am sure is the truth: that my cousin Arthur is innocent of this crime.' 'I completely agree with your belief, and I hope, like you, that we can prove it,' replied Holmes, going back to the mat to brush the snow from his shoes. 'I believe I have the pleasure of addressing Miss Mary Holder. May I ask you a few questions?' 'Please do, sir, if it can help resolve this terrible business.' 'You didn’t hear anything yourself last night?' 'Nothing, until my uncle here started speaking loudly. I heard that, and I came down.' 'You closed up the windows and doors the night before. Did you fasten all the windows?' 'Yes.' 'Were they all still fastened this morning?' 'Yes.' 'You have a maid who has a sweetheart? I think you mentioned to your uncle last night that she had been out to see him?' 'Yes, and she was the girl who was waiting in the drawing-room, and who might have overheard uncle’s comments about the coronet.' 'I see,' Holmes said. 'You’re suggesting she might have gone out to tell her sweetheart, and they might have plotted the robbery.' 'But what’s the point of all these vague theories?' the banker interrupted impatiently, 'when I’ve told you that I saw Arthur with the coronet in his hands?' 'Wait a moment, Mr. Holder. We will return to that. About this girl, Miss Holder, you saw her return by the kitchen door, I presume?' 'Yes; when I went to make sure the door was locked for the night, I met her sneaking in. I saw the man as well, in the dim light.' 'Do you know him?' 'Oh, yes! He’s the greengrocer who delivers our vegetables. His name is Francis Prosper.' 'He was standing,' Holmes said, 'to the left of the door—meaning, farther up the path than needed to reach the door?' 'Yes, he was.' 'And is he a man with a wooden leg?' A look of something like fear appeared in the young woman’s expressive black eyes. 'Why, you’re like a conjurer,' she said. 'How did you know that?' She smiled, but there was no answering smile on Holmes’s thin, intense face. 'I would very much like to go upstairs now,' he said. 'I will probably want to examine the outside of the house again later. Perhaps I should check the lower windows before going up.' He walked quickly from one window to the next, stopping only at the large one that faced the stable lane from the hall. He opened this window and carefully examined the sill using his powerful magnifying glass. 'Now we will go upstairs,' he finally said.",
          "paraphrase_gpt-4.1-2025-04-14": "After a brief train ride followed by a shorter walk, we arrived at Fairbank, the unassuming home of a prominent financier. The residence was a fairly large, square, white-stone house set back slightly from the road. In front, a double-curved driveway bordered a snow-covered lawn, leading down to the entrance secured by two substantial iron gates. On the right side stood a small grove of trees, leading to a narrow path flanked by tidy hedges that ran from the road to the kitchen door—this served as the tradesmen’s entrance. To the left, a public yet rarely used lane ran alongside the property to the stables, outside the main grounds.\n\nHolmes left us at the entrance and slowly circled the house, following the front drive, taking the tradesmen’s path, passing through the garden behind, and finally entering the lane by the stables. He took so long that Mr. Holder and I went inside to the dining room, where we waited by the fire for his return. We sat in silence until the door opened and a young woman entered. She was slightly taller than average, slender, with dark hair and eyes that appeared even darker due to her almost ghostly pale complexion. I don't think I'd ever seen a woman so pale—her lips devoid of color, yet her eyes were reddened from weeping. As she entered quietly, her deep sorrow was immediately apparent—surpassing even the banker’s anguish from earlier, which was especially striking given her obvious strength and self-control. Ignoring my presence, she went directly to her uncle and gently stroked his head in a loving gesture.\n\n“Have you arranged for Arthur’s release, father?” she asked.\n\n“No, my dear, this matter must be thoroughly investigated.”\n\n“But I’m certain he is innocent. You understand a woman’s intuition—I know he’s done nothing wrong, and you’ll regret being so severe.”\n\n“Then why does he remain silent if he’s innocent?”\n\n“Who can say? Maybe because he’s angry that you doubted him.”\n\n“How could I not suspect him when I saw him holding the coronet?”\n\n“Oh, he just picked it up to look at it. Please, believe me, he’s innocent. Drop the matter and speak of it no more. It pains me to think of poor Arthur in prison!”\n\n“I can’t let this go until the jewels are recovered—never, Mary! Your love for Arthur clouds your awareness of the serious consequences I face. Far from covering this up, I’ve brought someone down from London to investigate further.”\n\n“Is it this gentleman?” she asked, turning to me.\n\n“No, it’s his associate. He asked us to give him privacy. He’s in the stable lane at the moment.”\n\n“The stable lane?” She arched her eyebrows. “What does he hope to find there? Oh, that must be him. I hope, sir, you’ll succeed in proving what I’m sure is true—that my cousin Arthur is innocent.”\n\n“I agree with you, and hope we’ll prove it,” Holmes replied, returning to wipe the snow from his shoes. “I believe I have the pleasure of speaking to Miss Mary Holder. May I ask you some questions?”\n\n“Of course, if it will help solve this dreadful affair.”\n\n“Did you hear anything last night?”\n\n“No, not until my uncle raised his voice. That’s when I came down.”\n\n“Did you secure all the windows and doors the night before?”\n\n“Yes.”\n\n“Were they still fastened this morning?”\n\n“Yes.”\n\n“You have a maid with a sweetheart? I believe you told your uncle last night that she’d been out to meet him?”\n\n“Yes, and she was the same maid who served in the drawing-room and could have overheard uncle’s remarks about the coronet.”\n\n“I see. So you think she might have informed her sweetheart, and together they could have plotted the theft?”\n\n“But what’s the point of these speculations,” the banker said impatiently, “when I’ve told you I saw Arthur with the coronet in his hands?”\n\n“Let’s not jump ahead, Mr. Holder. We’ll return to that. Now, Miss Holder, about this maid—you saw her come in through the kitchen door?”\n\n“Yes. When I checked that the door was secured for the night, I found her sneaking in. I also saw the man in the shadows.”\n\n“You recognize him?”\n\n“Oh yes, he’s the greengrocer who supplies us with vegetables. His name is Francis Prosper.”\n\n“He was standing,” said Holmes, “to the left of the door—meaning farther up the path than one would need to reach the entrance?”\n\n“Yes, that’s correct.”\n\n“And he has a wooden leg?”\n\nA hint of alarm flashed in the young lady’s dark eyes. “Why, you’re like a magician! How could you tell?” She gave a wan smile, but Holmes’s face remained serious.\n\n“I’d like to go upstairs now,” he said. “I might want to look around the exterior again. Perhaps I should inspect the lower windows first.”\n\nHe quickly moved from window to window, stopping only at the large one looking from the hall over the stable lane, which he opened to scrutinize the sill closely with his powerful magnifying glass. “Now we’ll go up,” he finally said."

          "text_segment": "The banker’s dressing-room was a plainly furnished little chamber, with a grey carpet, a large bureau, and a long mirror. Holmes went to the bureau first and looked hard at the lock.\n“Which key was used to open it?” he asked.\n“That which my son himself indicated—that of the cupboard of the lumber-room.”\n“Have you it here?”\n“That is it on the dressing-table.”\nSherlock Holmes took it up and opened the bureau.\n“It is a noiseless lock,” said he. “It is no wonder that it did not wake you. This case, I presume, contains the coronet. We must have a look at it.” He opened the case, and taking out the diadem he laid it upon the table. It was a magnificent specimen of the jeweller’s art, and the thirty-six stones were the finest that I have ever seen. At one side of the coronet was a cracked edge, where a corner holding three gems had been torn away.\n“Now, Mr. Holder,” said Holmes, “here is the corner which corresponds to that which has been so unfortunately lost. Might I beg that you will break it off.”\nThe banker recoiled in horror. “I should not dream of trying,” said he.\n“Then I will.” Holmes suddenly bent his strength upon it, but without result. “I feel it give a little,” said he; “but, though I am exceptionally strong in the fingers, it would take me all my time to break it. An ordinary man could not do it. Now, what do you think would happen if I did break it, Mr. Holder? There would be a noise like a pistol shot. Do you tell me that all this happened within a few yards of your bed and that you heard nothing of it?”\n“I do not know what to think. It is all dark to me.”\n“But perhaps it may grow lighter as we go. What do you think, Miss Holder?”\n“I confess that I still share my uncle’s perplexity.”\n“Your son had no shoes or slippers on when you saw him?”\n“He had nothing on save only his trousers and shirt.”\n“Thank you. We have certainly been favoured with extraordinary luck during this inquiry, and it will be entirely our own fault if we do not succeed in clearing the matter up. With your permission, Mr. Holder, I shall now continue my investigations outside.”\nHe went alone, at his own request, for he explained that any unnecessary footmarks might make his task more difficult. For an hour or more he was at work, returning at last with his feet heavy with snow and his features as inscrutable as ever.\n“I think that I have seen now all that there is to see, Mr. Holder,” said he; “I can serve you best by returning to my rooms.”\n“But the gems, Mr. Holmes. Where are they?”\n“I cannot tell.”\nThe banker wrung his hands. “I shall never see them again!” he cried. “And my son? You give me hopes?”\n“My opinion is in no way altered.”\n“Then, for God’s sake, what was this dark business which was acted in my house last night?”\n“If you can call upon me at my Baker Street rooms to-morrow morning between nine and ten I shall be happy to do what I can to make it clearer. I understand that you give me carte blanche to act for you, provided only that I get back the gems, and that you place no limit on the sum I may draw.”\n“I would give my fortune to have them back.”\n“Very good. I shall look into the matter between this and then. Good-bye; it is just possible that I may have to come over here again before evening.”\nIt was obvious to me that my companion’s mind was now made up about the case, although what his conclusions were was more than I could even dimly imagine. Several times during our homeward journey I endeavoured to sound him upon the point, but he always glided away to some other topic, until at last I gave it over in despair. It was not yet three when we found ourselves in our rooms once more.",
          "paraphrase_gemini-2.5-flash-preview-04-17": "The banker's dressing room was a simple, small space, furnished with a grey rug, a sizable desk or chest of drawers (bureau), and a tall mirror. Holmes first approached the bureau, examining the lock intently. He inquired, \"Which key did you use to unlock it?\" The banker replied, \"The one my son mentioned himself—the key for the storage room cupboard.\" Holmes asked, \"Do you have it here?\" The banker indicated, \"It's there on the dressing table.\" Sherlock Holmes picked it up and unlocked the bureau. \"This lock makes no sound,\" he noted. \"It's not surprising that you weren't awakened. I assume this case contains the coronet. We need to see it.\" He opened the case, lifted out the diadem, and placed it on the table. It was a magnificent piece of craftsmanship, adorned with thirty-six stones that were the finest I had ever seen. On one side of the coronet, there was a damaged area, a cracked edge where a section holding three gems had been broken off. Holmes then addressed Mr. Holder, saying, \"Look, Mr. Holder, here is the part of the coronet that matches the section so unfortunately lost. Would you please try to break it off?\" The banker was horrified and drew back. \"I wouldn't even consider attempting that,\" he stated. \"Then I will,\" Holmes declared. He suddenly applied considerable force to it but couldn't break it. \"I feel it giving slightly,\" he commented, \"but even with my unusually strong fingers, it would take significant effort and time to break. An average person couldn't do it. Now, Mr. Holder, what sound do you think would result if I did break it? It would make a noise like a gun going off. Are you telling me this all happened just a few feet from your bed, and you heard nothing?\" The banker responded, \"I don't know what to think. It's all unclear to me.\" Holmes suggested, \"But perhaps things will become clearer as we proceed. What do you think, Miss Holder?\" She confessed, \"I must admit, I am as bewildered as my uncle.\" Holmes then asked, \"When you saw your son, was he wearing shoes or slippers?\" The banker replied, \"He was wearing only his trousers and shirt.\" Holmes thanked him, saying, \"Thank you. We have certainly had remarkable good fortune during this investigation, and it will be our own failure if we don't succeed in resolving this matter. With your permission, Mr. Holder, I will now continue my examination outside.\" He went out alone, as he requested, explaining that any extra footprints could complicate his work. He spent an hour or more working, finally returning with his feet heavy with snow and his expression as unreadable as ever. \"I believe I have now seen everything relevant, Mr. Holder,\" he announced. \"My best course of action is to return to my lodgings.\" The banker pressed him, \"But where are the gems, Mr. Holmes?\" Holmes replied, \"I cannot say.\" The banker wrung his hands in despair. \"I will never see them again!\" he cried. \"And my son? Do you offer any hope?\" Holmes's opinion remained unchanged: \"My view has not altered in any way.\" The banker then pleaded, \"Then, for heaven's sake, what was this terrible deed that took place in my house last night?\" Holmes offered, \"If you can visit me at my Baker Street rooms tomorrow morning between nine and ten, I will gladly do my best to shed more light on this. I understand that you are giving me complete authority to act on your behalf, provided I recover the gems, and that you are placing no financial limit on what I may spend.\" The banker declared, \"I would give my entire fortune to get them back.\" Holmes concluded, \"Very well. I will look into the matter between now and then. Good-bye; it is possible that I may need to return here again before this evening.\" To me, it was evident that my companion had reached a definite conclusion about the case, although his exact thoughts were completely beyond my understanding. Several times during our journey back home, I tried to question him about it, but he consistently diverted the conversation to other subjects, until I finally gave up trying in frustration. It was not yet three o'clock when we arrived back in our rooms.",
          "paraphrase_gpt-4.1-2025-04-14": "The banker's dressing room was a simple, small space, furnished with a grey carpet, a large desk, and a long mirror. Holmes went straight to the desk to examine its lock closely.\n\n\"Which key was used to open this?\" he enquired.\n\n\"My son pointed it out himself – it's the key to the lumber-room cupboard.\"\n\n\"Is it available?\"\n\n\"That's the key on the dressing-table.\"\n\nHolmes picked up the key and unlocked the desk.\n\n\"The lock makes no sound,\" he noted. \"No wonder you didn't hear it open. This case must hold the coronet. Let's inspect it.\" Holmes opened the case and placed the jeweled crown on the table. It was an impressive display of a jeweler's craftsmanship, featuring thirty-six exceptionally fine stones. However, one section was damaged – a corner holding three gems had been broken off.\n\n\"Mr. Holder,\" Holmes continued, \"here is the intact corner matching the section that’s missing. Would you attempt to break it off?\"\n\nThe banker stepped back, horrified. \"I couldn't possibly try,\" he replied.\n\n\"Then let me try.\" Holmes used all his strength but couldn't break the coronet. \"It moved a little,\" he observed, \"but even my strong fingers can’t snap it easily. A normal person couldn't manage it. And if I did break it, it would make a noise like a gunshot. Are you telling me all this occurred just a few paces from your bed and you heard nothing?\"\n\n\"I have no explanation. None of this makes sense to me.\"\n\n\"But perhaps things will become clearer. What do you think, Miss Holder?\"\n\n\"I'm as puzzled as my uncle,\" she admitted.\n\n\"When you saw your son, was he barefoot?\"\n\n\"All he wore were his trousers and shirt.\"\n\n\"Thank you. We've been remarkably lucky so far with our investigation, and if we fail to solve it now, the blame is ours alone. With your consent, Mr. Holder, I'll continue investigating outdoors.\"\n\nHolmes preferred to go alone, explaining that more footprints might complicate his work. He spent over an hour outside, returning with snow on his boots and his face as unreadable as ever.\n\n\"I've seen all I need to, Mr. Holder,\" Holmes said. \"Now, it’s best I go back to my rooms.\"\n\n\"But the jewels—where are they, Mr. Holmes?\"\n\n\"I don't yet know.\"\n\nThe banker, distraught, exclaimed, \"I'll never recover them! What about my son—can you give me hope?\"\n\n\"My opinion hasn't changed.\"\n\n\"Then please tell me: what happened in my house last night?\"\n\n\"If you visit me in Baker Street tomorrow morning between nine and ten, I'll do all I can to explain. May I confirm you’re giving me complete authority to act, with no limit on expenses as long as I get the gems back?\"\n\n\"I'd give anything to recover them.\"\n\n\"Good. I'll investigate further before then. Goodbye; it’s possible I may need to come back before evening.\"\n\nI could tell my friend had reached a conclusion, even if I couldn't guess what it was. Several times on our way home I tried to draw out his thoughts, but Holmes always changed the subject, until I gave up. We were back at our rooms before three o'clock."

With his collar turned up, his shiny, seedy coat, his red cravat, and his worn boots, he was a perfect sample of the class.\n“I think that this should do,” said he, glancing into the glass above the fireplace. “I only wish that you could come with me, Watson, but I fear that it won’t do. I may be on the trail in this matter, or I may be following a will-o’-the-wisp, but I shall soon know which it is. I hope that I may be back in a few hours.” He cut a slice of beef from the joint upon the sideboard, sandwiched it between two rounds of bread, and thrusting this rude meal into his pocket he started off upon his expedition.\nI had just finished my tea when he returned, evidently in excellent spirits, swinging an old elastic-sided boot in his hand. He chucked it down into a corner and helped himself to a cup of tea.\n“I only looked in as I passed,” said he. “I am going right on.”\n“Where to?”\n“Oh, to the other side of the West End. It may be some time before I get back. Don’t wait up for me in case I should be late.”\n“How are you getting on?”\n“Oh, so so. Nothing to complain of. I have been out to Streatham since I saw you last, but I did not call at the house. It is a very sweet little problem, and I would not have missed it for a good deal. However, I must not sit gossiping here, but must get these disreputable clothes off and return to my highly respectable self.”\nI could see by his manner that he had stronger reasons for satisfaction than his words alone would imply. His eyes twinkled, and there was even a touch of colour upon his sallow cheeks. He hastened upstairs, and a few minutes later I heard the slam of the hall door, which told me that he was off once more upon his congenial hunt.\nI waited until midnight, but there was no sign of his return, so I retired to my room. It was no uncommon thing for him to be away for days and nights on end when he was hot upon a scent, so that his lateness caused me no surprise. I do not know at what hour he came in, but when I came down to breakfast in the morning there he was with a cup of coffee in one hand and the paper in the other, as fresh and trim as possible.\n“You will excuse my beginning without you, Watson,” said he, “but you remember that our client has rather an early appointment this morning.”\n“Why, it is after nine now,” I answered. “I should not be surprised if that were he. I thought I heard a ring.”\nIt was, indeed, our friend the financier. I was shocked by the change which had come over him, for his face which was naturally of a broad and massive mould, was now pinched and fallen in, while his hair seemed to me at least a shade whiter. He entered with a weariness and lethargy which was even more painful than his violence of the morning before, and he dropped heavily into the armchair which I pushed forward for him.\n“I do not know what I have done to be so severely tried,” said he. “Only two days ago I was a happy and prosperous man, without a care in the world. Now I am left to a lonely and dishonoured age. One sorrow comes close upon the heels of another. My niece, Mary, has deserted me.”\n“Deserted you?”\n“Yes. Her bed this morning had not been slept in, her room was empty, and a note for me lay upon the hall table. I had said to her last night, in sorrow and not in anger, that if she had married my boy all might have been well with him. Perhaps it was thoughtless of me to say so. It is to that remark that she refers in this note:\n“‘MY DEAREST UNCLE,—I feel that I have brought trouble upon you, and that if I had acted differently this terrible misfortune might never have occurred. I cannot, with this thought in my mind, ever again be happy under your roof, and I feel that I must leave you forever. Do not worry about my future, for that is provided for; and, above all, do not search for me, for it will be fruitless labour and an ill-service to me. In life or in death, I am ever your loving,\n“‘MARY.’\n“What could she mean by that note, Mr. Holmes? Do you think it points to suicide?”\n“No, no, nothing of the kind. It is perhaps the best possible solution. I trust, Mr. Holder, that you are nearing the end of your troubles.”\n“Ha! You say so! You have heard something, Mr. Holmes; you have learned something! Where are the gems?”\n“You would not think £ 1000 apiece an excessive sum for them?”\n“I would pay ten.”\n“That would be unnecessary. Three thousand will cover the matter. And there is a little reward, I fancy. Have you your cheque-book? Here is a pen. Better make it out for £ 4000.”\nWith a dazed face the banker made out the required check. Holmes walked over to his desk, took out a little triangular piece of gold with three gems in it, and threw it down upon the table.\nWith a shriek of joy our client clutched it up.\n“You have it!” he gasped. “I am saved! I am saved!”\nThe reaction of joy was as passionate as his grief had been, and he hugged his recovered gems to his bosom.\n“There is one other thing you owe, Mr. Holder,” said Sherlock Holmes rather sternly.\n“Owe!” He caught up a pen. “Name the sum, and I will pay it.”\n“No, the debt is not to me. You owe a very humble apology to that noble lad, your son, who has carried himself in this matter as I should be proud to see my own son do, should I ever chance to have one.”\n“Then it was not Arthur who took them?”\n“I told you yesterday, and I repeat to-day, that it was not.”\n“You are sure of it! Then let us hurry to him at once to let him know that the truth is known.”\n“He knows it already. When I had cleared it all up I had an interview with him, and finding that he would not tell me the story, I told it to him, on which he had to confess that I was right and to add the very few details which were not yet quite clear to me. Your news of this morning, however, may open his lips.”",
          "paraphrase_gemini-2.5-flash-preview-04-17": "After quickly going to his room, he reappeared dressed like a common idler within a few minutes. With his collar turned up, a worn, shiny coat, a red tie, and scuffed boots, he perfectly embodied this type. “This should work, I believe,” he commented, looking at his reflection in the mirror above the fireplace. “I really wish you could come with me, Watson, but unfortunately, I don’t think it’s possible. I might be close to solving this matter, or I might be chasing a false lead, but I’ll find out soon enough. I hope to be back in a few hours.” He cut a piece of beef from the roast on the side table, put it between two slices of bread, and shoving this simple meal into his pocket, he set off on his excursion. I had just finished my tea when he came back, clearly in high spirits, swinging an old boot with elastic sides. He tossed it into a corner and poured himself a cup of tea. “I just stopped in quickly as I was passing,” he said. “I’m heading straight out again.” “Where to?” “Oh, to the opposite side of the West End. It might be some time before I return. Don’t stay up waiting for me in case I’m late.” “How is it going?” “Oh, fairly well. Nothing to complain about. I visited Streatham since we last spoke, but I didn’t go to the house. It’s quite an interesting little problem, and I wouldn’t have missed it for anything. However, I shouldn’t sit here chatting; I need to get out of these disreputable clothes and become my respectable self again.” I could tell from his demeanor that he had more reason for satisfaction than his words implied. His eyes sparkled, and there was even a hint of color in his pale cheeks. He hurried upstairs, and moments later I heard the front door slam, which told me he was off again on his preferred pursuit. I waited until midnight, but there was no sign of him, so I went to bed. It wasn’t unusual for him to be away for days and nights when he was focused on a case, so his lateness didn’t surprise me. I don’t know when he returned, but when I came down for breakfast in the morning, he was there, holding a cup of coffee in one hand and the newspaper in the other, looking as fresh and neat as ever. “You’ll forgive me for starting without you, Watson,” he said, “but you’ll recall our client has rather an early appointment this morning.” “Why, it’s past nine now,” I replied. “I wouldn’t be surprised if that’s him. I thought I heard a ring.” It was indeed our friend the financier. I was startled by how much he had changed; his face, which was naturally broad and solid, was now thin and hollowed, and his hair seemed to me at least a shade whiter. He entered with a weariness and lack of energy that was even more upsetting than his anger the morning before, and he collapsed heavily into the armchair I offered him. “I don’t know what I have done to deserve such severe trials,” he said. “Only two days ago I was happy and prosperous, without a worry in the world. Now I am left to face old age alone and disgraced. One misfortune follows closely after another. My niece, Mary, has left me.” “Left you?” “Yes. Her bed hadn’t been slept in this morning, her room was empty, and a note for me was on the hall table. I had told her last night, sadly rather than angrily, that if she had married my son, everything might have turned out well for him. Perhaps it was thoughtless of me to say that. It is to that comment that she refers in this note: ‘MY DEAREST UNCLE,—I feel that I have caused you trouble, and that if I had acted differently, this terrible misfortune might never have happened. With this thought in my mind, I can never again be happy living under your roof, and I feel I must leave you permanently. Do not worry about my future, as it is arranged; and, most importantly, do not look for me, as it will be a wasted effort and detrimental to me. In life or death, I am always your loving, ‘MARY.’ “What could she mean by that note, Mr. Holmes? Do you think it suggests suicide?” “No, no, nothing of the sort. It is possibly the best outcome. I trust, Mr. Holder, that your troubles are nearing an end.” “Ha! You say so! You’ve heard something, Mr. Holmes; you’ve learned something! Where are the gems?” “Would you consider £1000 each an excessive price for them?” “I would pay ten thousand.” “That won’t be necessary. Three thousand will cover the matter. And I expect there’s a small reward. Do you have your cheque-book? Here is a pen. It’s better to make it out for £4000.” With a stunned look, the banker wrote the requested cheque. Holmes went to his desk, took out a small triangular gold piece containing three gems, and placed it on the table. With a cry of joy, our client snatched it up. “You have it!” he gasped. “I am saved! I am saved!” His joyful reaction was as intense as his earlier grief had been, and he clutched the recovered gems to his chest. “There is one other thing you owe, Mr. Holder,” Sherlock Holmes said rather sternly. “Owe!” He picked up a pen. “Name the amount, and I will pay it.” “No, the debt is not to me. You owe a sincere apology to that fine young man, your son, who has conducted himself in this matter in a way I would be proud to see my own son behave, should I ever have one.” “Then it wasn’t Arthur who took them?” “I told you yesterday, and I repeat today, that it was not.” “You are certain! Then let us hurry to him at once to let him know that the truth is known.” “He knows it already. After I had clarified everything, I had a conversation with him, and finding that he would not tell me the story, I recounted it to him, upon which he had to admit I was right and add the few details that were not yet entirely clear to me. However, your news this morning may make him speak more freely.”",

I might be on to something in this case, or maybe I’m just chasing a false lead, but I’ll find out soon enough.

It might be some time before I return. Don’t stay up on my account if I’m late.”\n\n“How’s it going?”\n\n“So-so, nothing to complain about. Since I last saw you, I went out to Streatham but didn’t visit the house. It’s a charming little puzzle and I wouldn’t have missed it for anything. Anyway, I shouldn’t linger here—I need to get out of these grubby clothes and become my respectable self again.”\n\nJudging by his demeanor, I sensed he was more pleased than his words let on. His eyes sparkled and even his usually pale cheeks looked a bit flushed. He hurried upstairs, and moments later I heard the front door slam—he was off on another of his favorite cases.\n\nI waited until midnight, but when he didn’t return, I went to bed. His absences for days and nights when pursuing a lead were not unusual, so his lateness didn’t worry me. I don’t know when he finally came home, but by the time I went to breakfast the next morning, he was already there, looking as fresh as ever, sipping coffee and reading the paper.\n\n“Forgive me for starting without you, Watson,” he said. “Remember, our client has an early appointment today.”\n\n“It’s after nine,” I replied. “That may be him—I thought I heard the bell.”\n\nIndeed, it was the financier. I was shocked by how much he had changed—his broad face was now gaunt, and his hair looked even whiter. He came in with a tiredness and resignation more painful than the upset he’d shown the day before, and he sank heavily into the chair I offered.\n\n“I don’t know why I have to endure so much,” he said. “Just two days ago I was happy and secure, without a worry. Now I am left old, lonely, and disgraced. Misfortune after misfortune strikes. My niece Mary has left me.”\n\n“She’s left?”\n\n“Yes. Her bed was unused this morning, her room empty, and a note waiting for me in the hall. Last night, more in sadness than anger, I said that if she had married my son, perhaps things would have turned out better. Perhaps that was thoughtless. She refers to it in her note:\n\n‘MY DEAREST UNCLE,—I feel I have brought trouble upon you, and if I’d acted differently, perhaps this awful misfortune would never have happened. With this on my mind, I can never be happy in your home again, and I must leave you forever. Don’t worry about my future—it’s taken care of. Above all, don’t look for me, as it would be pointless and do me harm. In life or death, I will always love you. MARY.’\n\nWhat does this mean, Mr. Holmes? Do you think she’s run off to die?”\n\n“No, not at all. This may actually be the best outcome. I believe your troubles are nearly over, Mr. Holder.”\n\n“Ah! You say that! You must know something, Mr. Holmes! What about the gems?”\n\n“Would you consider £1,000 each a fair price for them?”\n\n“I’d pay ten times that.”\n\n“That won’t be necessary. £3,000 will settle it. Plus a modest reward, I think. Do you have your checkbook? Here’s a pen. Make it out for £4,000.”\n\nLooking bewildered, the banker wrote the check. Holmes went to his desk, pulled out a small triangular piece of gold set with three gems, and placed it on the table.\n\nWith a cry of joy our client snatched it up.\n\n“You have it!” he exclaimed. “I’m saved! Oh, thank you!”\n\nHis joy was as intense as his earlier sorrow, and he pressed the gems tightly to his chest.\n\n“There remains one other matter you owe, Mr. Holder,” Holmes said sternly.\n\n“Owe?” He grabbed a pen. “Name your price and I’ll pay.”\n\n“It’s not to me. You owe your son a humble apology. He’s behaved in a way that would make any father proud.”\n\n“So it wasn’t Arthur who did it?”\n\n“I told you yesterday, and I repeat it now: it wasn’t.”\n\n“You’re sure! Then we must go to him right away and let him know.”\n\n“He already knows. When I had it all resolved, I spoke to him. Since he wouldn’t tell me the story, I told him, and he confirmed I was right and filled in some small missing details. Your news this morning may persuade him to say even more.”"

            "Holmes recounts the events: Mary slipped down after Holder went to bed, talked to Burnwell through the stable lane window (his long wait evidenced by deep footmarks), and told him about the coronet.",
            "Burnwell's greed was ignited, and he persuaded Mary (whose love for her lover overshadowed other loyalties) to help him.",
            "Mary saw Holder coming downstairs, quickly closed the window, and deflected by mentioning Lucy's true escapade with her wooden-legged lover.",
            "Arthur, unable to sleep due to debt worries, heard footsteps, saw Mary stealthily enter and leave the dressing-room with the coronet.",
            "Arthur hid behind a curtain and watched Mary pass the coronet through the hall window to someone outside, then return to her room.",
            "Unable to act while Mary was present without exposing her, Arthur waited until she left.",

            "They struggled; Arthur struck Burnwell over the eye. The coronet snapped, Arthur regained the main part, rushed back inside, closed the window, went to Holder's room, and was trying to straighten the twisted coronet when Holder discovered him.",
            "Holder's accusations angered Arthur, who felt he deserved thanks.",
            "Arthur chose the 'chivalrous view', protecting Mary's secret rather than explain.",

            "In the stable lane, he found two sets of tracks: booted (Burnwell) and naked feet (Arthur). Barefoot ran after Booted had walked both ways.",
            "The tracks led to the hall window (where Booted waited) and down the lane to signs of a struggle, drops of blood (confirming injury), and Booted's escape route.",
            "Examination of the hall window sill confirmed passage in/out (wet instep mark).",
            "Holmes deduced: Man waited, someone brought gems, son oversaw, pursued thief, struggled, coronet broke, son returned with main part, fragment left with thief.",
            "Using his maxim (eliminate impossible, whatever remains, however improbable, is truth), he reasoned: Holder didn't take it; if maids did, Arthur wouldn't protect them; therefore, Arthur protected Mary due to love and her disgraceful secret.",
            "Mary's presence at the window and fainting confirmed her involvement.",
            "The confederate must be a lover; Sir George Burnwell, with his known reputation and access, fit the profile.",

          "text_segment": "“For Heaven’s sake, tell me, then, what is this extraordinary mystery!”\n“I will do so, and I will show you the steps by which I reached it. And let me say to you, first, that which it is hardest for me to say and for you to hear: there has been an understanding between Sir George Burnwell and your niece Mary. They have now fled together.”\n“My Mary? Impossible!”\n“It is unfortunately more than possible; it is certain. Neither you nor your son knew the true character of this man when you admitted him into your family circle. He is one of the most dangerous men in England—a ruined gambler, an absolutely desperate villain, a man without heart or conscience. Your niece knew nothing of such men. When he breathed his vows to her, as he had done to a hundred before her, she flattered herself that she alone had touched his heart. The devil knows best what he said, but at least she became his tool and was in the habit of seeing him nearly every evening.”\n“I cannot, and I will not, believe it!” cried the banker with an ashen face.\n“I will tell you, then, what occurred in your house last night. Your niece, when you had, as she thought, gone to your room, slipped down and talked to her lover through the window which leads into the stable lane. His footmarks had pressed right through the snow, so long had he stood there. She told him of the coronet. His wicked lust for gold kindled at the news, and he bent her to his will. I have no doubt that she loved you, but there are women in whom the love of a lover extinguishes all other loves, and I think that she must have been one. She had hardly listened to his instructions when she saw you coming downstairs, on which she closed the window rapidly and told you about one of the servants’ escapade with her wooden-legged lover, which was all perfectly true.\n“Your boy, Arthur, went to bed after his interview with you but he slept badly on account of his uneasiness about his club debts. In the middle of the night he heard a soft tread pass his door, so he rose and, looking out, was surprised to see his cousin walking very stealthily along the passage until she disappeared into your dressing-room. Petrified with astonishment, the lad slipped on some clothes and waited there in the dark to see what would come of this strange affair. Presently she emerged from the room again, and in the light of the passage-lamp your son saw that she carried the precious coronet in her hands. She passed down the stairs, and he, thrilling with horror, ran along and slipped behind the curtain near your door, whence he could see what passed in the hall beneath. He saw her stealthily open the window, hand out the coronet to someone in the gloom, and then closing it once more hurry back to her room, passing quite close to where he stood hid behind the curtain.\n“As long as she was on the scene he could not take any action without a horrible exposure of the woman whom he loved. But the instant that she was gone he realised how crushing a misfortune this would be for you, and how all-important it was to set it right. He rushed down, just as he was, in his bare feet, opened the window, sprang out into the snow, and ran down the lane, where he could see a dark figure in the moonlight. Sir George Burnwell tried to get away, but Arthur caught him, and there was a struggle between them, your lad tugging at one side of the coronet, and his opponent at the other. In the scuffle, your son struck Sir George and cut him over the eye. Then something suddenly snapped, and your son, finding that he had the coronet in his hands, rushed back, closed the window, ascended to your room, and had just observed that the coronet had been twisted in the struggle and was endeavouring to straighten it when you appeared upon the scene.”\n“Is it possible?” gasped the banker.\n“You then roused his anger by calling him names at a moment when he felt that he had deserved your warmest thanks. He could not explain the true state of affairs without betraying one who certainly deserved little enough consideration at his hands. He took the more chivalrous view, however, and preserved her secret.”\n“And that was why she shrieked and fainted when she saw the coronet,” cried Mr. Holder. “Oh, my God! what a blind fool I have been! And his asking to be allowed to go out for five minutes! The dear fellow wanted to see if the missing piece were at the scene of the struggle. How cruelly I have misjudged him!”\n“When I arrived at the house,” continued Holmes, “I at once went very carefully round it to observe if there were any traces in the snow which might help me. I knew that none had fallen since the evening before, and also that there had been a strong frost to preserve impressions. I passed along the tradesmen’s path, but found it all trampled down and indistinguishable. Just beyond it, however, at the far side of the kitchen door, a woman had stood and talked with a man, whose round impressions on one side showed that he had a wooden leg. I could even tell that they had been disturbed, for the woman had run back swiftly to the door, as was shown by the deep toe and light heel marks, while Wooden-leg had waited a little, and then had gone away. I thought at the time that this might be the maid and her sweetheart, of whom you had already spoken to me, and inquiry showed it was so. I passed round the garden without seeing anything more than random tracks, which I took to be the police; but when I got into the stable lane a very long and complex story was written in the snow in front of me.\n“There was a double line of tracks of a booted man, and a second double line which I saw with delight belonged to a man with naked feet. I was at once convinced from what you had told me that the latter was your son. The first had walked both ways, but the other had run swiftly, and as his tread was marked in places over the depression of the boot, it was obvious that he had passed after the other. I followed them up and found they led to the hall window, where Boots had worn all the snow away while waiting. Then I walked to the other end, which was a hundred yards or more down the lane. I saw where Boots had faced round, where the snow was cut up as though there had been a struggle, and, finally, where a few drops of blood had fallen, to show me that I was not mistaken. Boots had then run down the lane, and another little smudge of blood showed that it was he who had been hurt. When he came to the high road at the other end, I found that the pavement had been cleared, so there was an end to that clue.\n“On entering the house, however, I examined, as you remember, the sill and framework of the hall window with my lens, and I could at once see that someone had passed out. I could distinguish the outline of an instep where the wet foot had been placed in coming in. I was then beginning to be able to form an opinion as to what had occurred. A man had waited outside the window; someone had brought the gems; the deed had been overseen by your son; he had pursued the thief; had struggled with him; they had each tugged at the coronet, their united strength causing injuries which neither alone could have effected. He had returned with the prize, but had left a fragment in the grasp of his opponent. So far I was clear. The question now was, who was the man, and who was it brought him the coronet?\n“It is an old maxim of mine that when you have excluded the impossible, whatever remains, however improbable, must be the truth. Now, I knew that it was not you who had brought it down, so there only remained your niece and the maids. But if it were the maids, why should your son allow himself to be accused in their place? There could be no possible reason. As he loved his cousin, however, there was an excellent explanation why he should retain her secret—the more so as the secret was a disgraceful one. When I remembered that you had seen her at that window, and how she had fainted on seeing the coronet again, my conjecture became a certainty.\n“And who could it be who was her confederate? A lover evidently, for who else could outweigh the love and gratitude which she must feel to you? I knew that you went out little, and that your circle of friends was a very limited one. But among them was Sir George Burnwell. I had heard of him before as being a man of evil reputation among women. It must have been he who wore those boots and retained the missing gems. Even though he knew that Arthur had discovered him, he might still flatter himself that he was safe, for the lad could not say a word without compromising his own family.\n“Well, your own good sense will suggest what measures I took next. I went in the shape of a loafer to Sir George’s house, managed to pick up an acquaintance with his valet, learned that his master had cut his head the night before, and, finally, at the expense of six shillings, made all sure by buying a pair of his cast-off shoes. With these I journeyed down to Streatham and saw that they exactly fitted the tracks.”\n“I saw an ill-dressed vagabond in the lane yesterday evening,” said Mr. Holder.\n“Precisely. It was I. I found that I had my man, so I came home and changed my clothes. It was a delicate part which I had to play then, for I saw that a prosecution must be avoided to avert scandal, and I knew that so astute a villain would see that our hands were tied in the matter. I went and saw him. At first, of course, he denied everything. But when I gave him every particular that had occurred, he tried to bluster and took down a life-preserver from the wall. I knew my man, however, and I clapped a pistol to his head before he could strike. Then he became a little more reasonable. I told him that we would give him a price for the stones he held—£ 1000 apiece. That brought out the first signs of grief that he had shown. ‘Why, dash it all!’ said he, ‘I’ve let them go at six hundred for the three!’ I soon managed to get the address of the receiver who had them, on promising him that there would be no prosecution. Off I set to him, and after much chaffering I got our stones at £ 1000 apiece. Then I looked in upon your son, told him that all was right, and eventually got to my bed about two o’clock, after what I may call a really hard day’s work.”",
          "paraphrase_gemini-2.5-flash-preview-04-17": "“For heaven’s sake,” the banker pleaded, “please explain this strange puzzle!” “I shall, and I will walk you through how I solved it,” Holmes replied. “But first, I must tell you something difficult for both of us: Sir George Burnwell and your niece Mary have had a secret relationship, and they have now run off together.” “My Mary? That’s impossible!” Holder exclaimed. “Sadly, it’s not only possible, but it’s definite. Neither you nor your son truly understood the sort of man you let into your home. He’s one of the most dangerous figures in England—a ruined gambler, a completely desperate scoundrel, utterly without feeling or morality. Your niece, inexperienced with such men, believed she had genuinely captured his heart when he made promises to her, just as he had done to countless others before. Only the devil knows what he said to manipulate her, but she became his pawn and was meeting him almost every evening.” “I cannot, and will not, accept this!” the banker cried, his face turning pale. “Allow me then to tell you what happened in your house last night. After you had retired, as she believed, your niece crept downstairs and spoke with her lover through the window leading to the stable lane. His footprints were pressed deep into the snow, showing how long he had waited there. She informed him about the coronet. His evil greed for wealth ignited at the news, and he persuaded her to do his bidding. I have no doubt she cared for you, but some women prioritize their lover above all others, and I suspect she was one of them. She had barely heard his instructions when she saw you approaching downstairs, causing her to quickly shut the window and tell you about one of the servants and her wooden-legged admirer – which, incidentally, was a true story she used to deflect suspicion. “Your son, Arthur, went to bed after your talk but couldn’t sleep well due to worry about his gambling debts. In the middle of the night, he heard soft footsteps pass his door. He got up, looked out, and was astonished to see his cousin moving very quietly along the hallway before she went into your dressing-room. Frozen by disbelief, the boy quickly put on some clothes and hid in the dark, waiting to see what would unfold. Soon, she came out again, and by the light of the passage lamp, your son saw she was carrying the valuable coronet. She went downstairs, and he, filled with dread, rushed after her and concealed himself behind the curtain by your door, from where he could observe the hall below. He watched her quietly open the window, pass the coronet to someone hidden in the shadows outside, then close the window and hurry back to her room, walking very near where he was hidden behind the curtain. “As long as she was there, he couldn’t act without terribly exposing the woman he loved. But the moment she was gone, he realised the immense disaster this would cause you and how critical it was to put things right. He rushed downstairs just as he was, barefoot, opened the window, jumped out into the snow, and ran down the lane where he could see a dark figure in the moonlight. Sir George Burnwell tried to escape, but Arthur caught him, and they struggled. Your son pulled one side of the coronet, and Burnwell the other. During the struggle, your son hit Sir George, cutting his eye. Then, something suddenly broke, and your son, finding he had the coronet in his hands, rushed back inside, closed the window, went up to your room, and had just noticed the coronet was bent in the struggle and was attempting to fix it when you walked in.” “Is that possible?” the banker gasped. “You then angered him by scolding him severely at a moment when he felt he deserved your highest praise. He couldn’t explain the real situation without exposing someone who frankly didn’t deserve his protection. However, he chose the more honourable path and kept her secret.” “And that’s why she screamed and fainted when she saw the coronet again!” cried Mr. Holder. “Oh, dear God! What a complete fool I’ve been! And when he asked to go out for five minutes! The poor boy wanted to see if the broken piece was where they struggled. How terribly I misjudged him!” “When I got to the house,” Holmes continued, “I immediately walked around it very carefully to look for any helpful marks in the snow. I knew no snow had fallen since the previous evening and that a hard frost had preserved any impressions. I checked the tradesmen’s entrance path, but it was completely trampled and indistinct. However, just beyond it, near the kitchen door, a woman had clearly stood and talked with a man whose circular footprints on one side showed he had a wooden leg. I could even tell they had been startled because the woman had run back quickly to the door, indicated by the deep toe marks and light heel marks, while the man with the wooden leg had paused before leaving. I suspected at the time this might be the maid and her boyfriend you mentioned, and my inquiries confirmed it. I circled the garden but only saw random tracks I assumed were from the police. But when I reached the stable lane, a detailed and long story was written in the snow before me. “There was a double set of tracks from a man wearing boots, and a second double set which I was thrilled to see belonged to a man with bare feet. Based on what you told me, I was instantly certain the latter was your son. The first man had walked both ways, but the other had run swiftly, and since his steps were sometimes pressed over the impressions of the boot, it was clear he had come after the first man. I followed their tracks and found they led to the hall window, where the booted man had worn away the snow while waiting. Then I went to the other end of the lane, over a hundred yards away. I saw where the booted man had turned around, where the snow was disturbed as if there had been a fight, and finally, where a few drops of blood had fallen, proving I was correct. The booted man had then run further down the lane, and another small smear of blood showed he was the one who was injured. When he reached the main road at the far end, I found the pavement had been cleared, so that trail ended. “However, upon entering the house, as you remember, I examined the sill and frame of the hall window with my magnifying glass and could immediately tell someone had climbed out and back in. I could see the outline of an instep where a wet foot had been placed upon re-entering. At that point, I began to form a clear picture of what had occurred. A man had waited outside the window; someone had brought him the jewels; your son had witnessed the act; he had chased the thief; struggled with him; they had both pulled at the coronet, their combined strength causing the damage neither alone could have done. He had returned with the main part, but had left a piece in his opponent’s hand. So far, I was certain. The questions now were, who was the man outside, and who had brought him the coronet? “It’s a long-held rule of mine that once you eliminate the impossible, whatever remains, no matter how improbable, must be the truth. Now, I knew you hadn’t brought it downstairs, leaving only your niece and the maids. But if it were the maids, why would your son allow himself to be blamed in their place? There could be no logical reason. However, since he loved his cousin, there was a very good reason for him to protect her secret—especially since it was a shameful one. When I recalled that you had seen her at that window and how she had fainted upon seeing the coronet again, my guess became an absolute certainty. “And who could her accomplice be? Clearly a lover, because who else could outweigh the love and gratitude she must feel towards you? I knew you rarely went out and had a very small circle of friends. But among them was Sir George Burnwell. I had heard of his poor reputation concerning women before. It had to be him who wore those boots and kept the missing gems. Even though he knew Arthur had discovered him, he might still have believed he was safe because your son couldn’t say anything without bringing disgrace upon his own family. “Well, your own common sense will tell you what I did next. I went to Sir George’s house dressed like a casual wanderer, managed to strike up a conversation with his valet, learned that his master had cut his head the previous night, and finally, for the price of six shillings, made everything certain by purchasing a pair of his discarded shoes. With these, I travelled down to Streatham and confirmed they precisely matched the tracks.” “I saw a shabbily dressed tramp in the lane yesterday evening,” Mr. Holder remarked. “Precisely. That was me. I had my man, so I returned home and changed. The next part I had to play was sensitive, as I realised a prosecution must be avoided to prevent a public scandal, and I knew such a clever villain would understand we were limited in our options. I went to confront him. At first, naturally, he denied everything. But when I recounted every specific detail of what had happened, he grew angry and reached for a life-preserver on the wall. I knew how to handle him, however, and I placed a pistol to his head before he could strike. Then he became more reasonable. I offered him a price for the stones he had—£1000 each. That finally showed the first hint of regret he had displayed. ‘Why, damn it all!’ he said, ‘I let them go for six hundred for the three!’ I quickly managed to get the address of the person who had received them, promising him there would be no legal action. I went off to the receiver, and after a lot of negotiation, I bought our stones back for £1000 each. Then I stopped by to see your son, told him everything was resolved, and finally got to bed around two o’clock, after what I’d call a truly demanding day’s work.”",
          "paraphrase_gpt-4.1-2025-04-14": "\"Please, for heaven's sake, explain to me what this unusual mystery is!\"  \n\"Certainly. I'll walk you through the reasoning that led me here. First, I must tell you something that will be hard to say and even harder for you to hear: a secret relationship has existed between Sir George Burnwell and your niece, Mary. Together, they've now run away.\"\n\"My Mary? That's impossible!\"\n\"Sadly, it's more than possible—it's a fact. Neither you nor your son realized the true nature of this man when he was allowed into your family. He's one of England's most dangerous men—a ruined gambler, ruthless villain, entirely lacking in heart or conscience. Mary could never have understood the likes of him. When he whispered his love, as he has done to many women before, she imagined she had truly won his heart. What he really said only the devil himself could know, but he made her his accomplice and was seeing her almost every night.\"\n\"I can't and won't believe this!\" the banker exclaimed, pale with shock.\n\"Let me recount what happened in your home last night. Mary, believing you had retired, snuck downstairs to speak with her lover through the stable lane window. He'd stood on the snow so long, his footprints were deep. She told him of the coronet. His greed flared, and he manipulated her. I don't doubt she loved you, but sometimes a woman’s love for a man takes over all others, and this seems to have been the case. She scarcely finished hearing his plans when she saw you coming down, so she quickly closed the window and distracted you with a story about a servant and her wooden-legged partner, which was in fact true.\nYour son, Arthur, anxious over his gambling debts, tossed and turned in bed. During the night, he heard a soft step pass his door, rose to investigate, and was surprised to see his cousin, Mary, creeping down the hall toward your dressing-room. Stunned, he quietly dressed and waited in the dark to see what would happen. Soon, Mary came out again, and in the hall's light, Arthur saw she was carrying the valuable coronet. She hurried downstairs. Full of horror, he followed and hid behind your door's curtain, from where he watched Mary open the window, pass the coronet to someone in the darkness, and then rush back to her room. Arthur dared not intervene while Mary was present, but as soon as she was gone, he realized the seriousness of what had happened and wanted to fix it. He rushed outside barefoot, saw a dark figure in the moonlight, and chased after him. Sir George tried to escape, but Arthur caught up; a struggle ensued, both taking hold of the coronet. Arthur struck Sir George, cutting his face, and in the tussle, the coronet snapped. Grabbing it, Arthur hurried back inside, tried to fix the twisted piece, and that's when you found him.\"\n\"Could that be?\" gasped the banker.\n\"Then, when you scolded him, he was hurt, feeling he deserved thanks for his actions. He wouldn’t tell you the truth, not wanting to expose Mary, who hardly warranted such protection. Still, he chose to protect her secret out of honor.\"\n\n\"And that's why Mary screamed and fainted when she saw the coronet! Oh, I've been so blind! And when he asked permission to leave the house, he must have wanted to look for the missing piece where the fight had happened. How terrible that I misjudged him!\"\n\n\"When I arrived, I immediately searched around the house for any traces left in the snow. Since no new snow had fallen and frost preserved the prints, I searched along the tradesmen’s path but found it too disturbed to discern anything. Near the kitchen door, though, I saw prints indicating a woman had spoken to a man with a round-footed, likely wooden, leg. The woman's track showed she ran back to the door, and the man left a bit after—exactly like the maid and her lover you'd told me of. Checking the garden, I saw only random tracks—probably police—until I found, in the stable lane, a detailed story in the snow: double lines of booted tracks, and another set from barefooted feet—your son’s, I guessed. The boots had gone both ways, but the bare feet only ran one way, sometimes on top of the boot prints, so clearly your son followed the booted man. The track led to the hall window, which was cleared of snow from the waiting boots. The tracks ended at a spot showing a struggle, then signs of blood—affirming my theory. The booted man ran off, bleeding slightly, obvious from more blood in the snow. The tracks ended at the cleared pavement of the high road.\n\n\"Inside, I examined the window’s sill with my lens and found wet footprints from someone coming in. At this point, I theorized: someone had waited outside; another brought the jewels; your son saw the exchange, pursued the culprit, fought for the coronet, and won—all causing the physical damage seen. But who, exactly, were the participants? It couldn't have been you who delivered the coronet, so it was either your niece or the maids. But why would your son risk blame to cover for a maid? His protecting Mary made sense, especially as the truth would disgrace her. Remembering you saw Mary at the window, and her fainting at sight of the coronet, confirmed everything for me.\"\n\n\"Who could be her partner? It had to be someone for whom her love could outweigh any other bond—a lover. You rarely go out and know few people, but Sir George Burnwell stood out, known for his scandalous reputation. He must be the one who wore the boots and escaped with the jewels. Even if Arthur had discovered him, Sir George could count on the boy keeping quiet to protect the family.\"\n\n\"Naturally, I took action—I disguised myself as a vagrant, befriended Sir George’s servant, learned his master rested with a head wound, and for six shillings, bought a pair of his old shoes. When I compared them to the prints at your house in Streatham, they matched perfectly.\"\n\n\"I did see a poorly dressed tramp in the lane yesterday evening,\" Mr. Holder commented.\n\n\"That was me. Once I confirmed my suspect, I changed my clothes. I realized a formal prosecution would cause scandal, so I confronted Sir George privately. At first, he denied all, then tried to intimidate me, but I pulled a pistol and demanded answers. He then admitted everything. I offered to buy back the jewels for £1,000 a piece, whereupon he lamented he’d already sold all three for merely £600. He gave up the receiver’s address after I promised no charges. I bought back the jewels at £1,000 apiece, returned, explained everything to your son, and finally, after a taxing day, went to bed at 2 a.m.\""

It is pleasant to me to observe, Watson, that you have so far grasped this truth that in these little records of our cases which you have been good enough to draw up, and, I am bound to say, occasionally to embellish, you have given prominence not so much to the many causes célèbres and sensational trials in which I have figured but rather to those incidents which may have been trivial in themselves, but which have given room for those faculties of deduction and of logical synthesis which I have made my special province.”\n“And yet,” said I, smiling, “I cannot quite hold myself absolved from the charge of sensationalism which has been urged against my records.”\n“You have erred, perhaps,” he observed, taking up a glowing cinder with the tongs and lighting with it the long cherry-wood pipe which was wont to replace his clay when he was in a disputatious rather than a meditative mood—“you have erred perhaps in attempting to put colour and life into each of your statements instead of confining yourself to the task of placing upon record that severe reasoning from cause to effect which is really the only notable feature about the thing.”\n“It seems to me that I have done you full justice in the matter,” I remarked with some coldness, for I was repelled by the egotism which I had more than once observed to be a strong factor in my friend’s singular character.\n“No, it is not selfishness or conceit,” said he, answering, as was his wont, my thoughts rather than my words. “If I claim full justice for my art, it is because it is an impersonal thing—a thing beyond myself. Crime is common. Logic is rare. Therefore it is upon the logic rather than upon the crime that you should dwell. You have degraded what should have been a course of lectures into a series of tales.”\nIt was a cold morning of the early spring, and we sat after breakfast on either side of a cheery fire in the old room at Baker Street. A thick fog rolled down between the lines of dun-coloured houses, and the opposing windows loomed like dark, shapeless blurs through the heavy yellow wreaths. Our gas was lit and shone on the white cloth and glimmer of china and metal, for the table had not been cleared yet. Sherlock Holmes had been silent all the morning, dipping continuously into the advertisement columns of a succession of papers until at last, having apparently given up his search, he had emerged in no very sweet temper to lecture me upon my literary shortcomings.",
          "paraphrase_gemini-2.5-flash-preview-04-17": "For someone who genuinely appreciates art, remarked Sherlock Holmes, tossing aside the newspaper's advertisement section, the greatest satisfaction is often found in its most humble and insignificant forms. I am pleased, Watson, to see that you have understood this concept to the extent that, in the brief accounts you've kindly written about our cases, which, I must admit, you've sometimes added detail to, you have chosen to highlight not the many famous and dramatic legal battles I've been involved in, but instead those events that might have seemed minor on their own but provided opportunities to demonstrate my particular skills in deduction and putting facts together logically.\"However,\" I replied with a smile, \"I cannot entirely clear myself of the accusation of sensationalism that has been made about my writings.\"\"Perhaps you have made a mistake,\" he commented, using the tongs to pick up a hot ember and light his long cherry-wood pipe, the one he typically used when feeling argumentative rather than thoughtful. \"Perhaps your error was in trying to inject vibrancy and drama into each report instead of limiting yourself to documenting the rigorous step-by-step logic from cause to effect, which is truly the only significant aspect of these matters.\"\"It appears to me I have depicted you fairly in this regard,\" I stated with a touch of coolness, as I found the self-importance I had frequently noticed as a prominent trait in my friend's unique personality rather off-putting.\"No, that's not selfishness or vanity,\" he replied, responding, as he often did, to what I was thinking rather than what I said. \"If I demand proper recognition for my method, it's because it is something detached and greater than me personally. Crimes happen all the time; logical thinking is uncommon. So, your focus should be on the logic involved, not the crime itself. You have turned what ought to be detailed explanations into mere stories.\"It was a chilly early spring morning, and we were seated after breakfast, facing each other by a warm fire in the familiar Baker Street room. A dense fog drifted between the rows of drab-coloured buildings, making the windows across the street appear as indistinct, shadowy shapes within the thick, yellowish mist. Our gas light was on, illuminating the white tablecloth and the gleam of the dishes and silverware, as the breakfast table hadn't been cleared. Sherlock Holmes had spent the entire morning silently poring over the classified sections of several newspapers. Finally, seeming to abandon his search, he had surfaced in a rather ill humour to criticize my writing deficiencies.",
          "paraphrase_gpt-4.1-2025-04-14": "Sherlock Holmes, after putting down the advertisement section of The Daily Telegraph, commented that for those who appreciate art for its own sake, the greatest enjoyment often comes from its simplest and least notable forms. He told Watson that he was glad to see that, in the accounts Watson had written about their cases, he chose to highlight not so much the famous and dramatic trials Holmes was involved in, but rather the seemingly minor incidents. These minor cases, while perhaps insignificant in themselves, allowed Holmes to display his skills in deduction and logical reasoning, which he valued most. \n\nWatson, smiling, responded that he still felt somewhat guilty of the sensationalism that had been attributed to his writings. Holmes replied, as he lit his long cherry-wood pipe, that perhaps Watson's mistake was in trying to make each account vivid and lively, when he should have focused just on thoroughly detailing the logical thought processes that were the defining feature of the investigations.\n\nWatson, a bit coldly, said he thought he had portrayed Holmes fairly enough, feeling put off by Holmes's egotism. Holmes, as was his habit, responded to Watson's thoughts rather than his words, and said it was not egotism or selfishness on his part. Rather, he believed that his craft was something objective and impersonal—something greater than himself. \"Crime is common,\" he said, \"but logic is rare. It is on the logic, not the crime, that you should concentrate. You have turned what should have been a series of lectures into a collection of stories.\"\n\nThe conversation took place on a chilly early spring morning after breakfast, as the two sat by a warm fire in their Baker Street rooms. A dense fog lay between the dull-colored houses outside, making the windows across the street barely visible as dark, formless shapes through the thick, yellow mist. The gas lamps were on, lighting up the white breakfast table, which had not yet been cleared. Holmes had been silent all morning, absorbed in reading the advertisement pages of various papers. Finally, after giving up his search, he turned to criticize Watson on how he wrote up their cases."

The small matter in which I endeavoured to help the King of Bohemia, the singular experience of Miss Mary Sutherland, the problem connected with the man with the twisted lip, and the incident of the noble bachelor, were all matters which are outside the pale of the law. But in avoiding the sensational, I fear that you may have bordered on the trivial.”\n“The end may have been so,” I answered, “but the methods I hold to have been novel and of interest.”\n“Pshaw, my dear fellow, what do the public, the great unobservant public, who could hardly tell a weaver by his tooth or a compositor by his left thumb, care about the finer shades of analysis and deduction! But, indeed, if you are trivial, I cannot blame you, for the days of the great cases are past. Man, or at least criminal man, has lost all enterprise and originality. As to my own little practice, it seems to be degenerating into an agency for recovering lost lead pencils and giving advice to young ladies from boarding-schools. I think that I have touched bottom at last, however. This note I had this morning marks my zero-point, I fancy. Read it!” He tossed a crumpled letter across to me.\nIt was dated from Montague Place upon the preceding evening, and ran thus:\n“DEAR MR. HOLMES,—I am very anxious to consult you as to whether I should or should not accept a situation which has been offered to me as governess. I shall call at half-past ten to-morrow if I do not inconvenience you. Yours faithfully,\n“VIOLET HUNTER.”\n“Do you know the young lady?” I asked.\n“Not I.”\n“It is half-past ten now.”\n“Yes, and I have no doubt that is her ring.”\n“It may turn out to be of more interest than you think. You remember that the affair of the blue carbuncle, which appeared to be a mere whim at first, developed into a serious investigation. It may be so in this case, also.”\n“Well, let us hope so. But our doubts will very soon be solved, for here, unless I am much mistaken, is the person in question.”\nAs he spoke the door opened and a young lady entered the room.",
          "paraphrase_gemini-2.5-flash-preview-04-17": "After a quiet moment spent smoking his long pipe and watching the fire, Holmes remarked that I could hardly be accused of exaggerating or focusing solely on sensational events, given that many of the cases I had found interesting weren't actually crimes in a legal sense. He cited my efforts to assist the King of Bohemia, Miss Mary Sutherland's unusual situation, the mystery involving the man with the twisted lip, and the incident concerning the noble bachelor as examples of matters falling outside the law. However, he worried that in avoiding sensationalism, I might have made the accounts seem insignificant. I replied that while the outcome might have been minor, I felt my methods were original and noteworthy. Holmes dismissed this, scoffing, \"My dear fellow, what do the public - that largely inattentive public who can't even distinguish a weaver by looking at their teeth or a printer by their left thumb - care about detailed analysis and logical steps?\" He admitted that if the cases were trivial, he couldn't blame me, as the era of significant cases was over, and he believed criminals had lost their ambition and ingenuity. As for his own work, he felt it was increasingly mundane, resembling a service for finding misplaced pencils and advising young women from boarding schools. He thought he had finally hit rock bottom, suggesting a note he received that morning marked this low point. He tossed a crumpled letter towards me, telling me to read it. Dated the previous evening from Montague Place, it read: \"DEAR MR. HOLMES, I urgently need your advice regarding whether I should accept a governess position I've been offered. I will visit tomorrow at half-past ten if that time is suitable. Yours faithfully, VIOLET HUNTER.\" I asked if he knew the young woman. \"Not at all,\" he replied. \"It's half-past ten now,\" I observed. \"Yes,\" he agreed, \"and I'm sure that's her ringing the doorbell.\" I suggested it might prove more interesting than he anticipated, reminding him how the case of the blue carbuncle, initially appearing trivial, evolved into a serious investigation. \"It might be the same here,\" I said. \"Well, let's hope so,\" he responded. \"But we won't have to wait long to find out, because unless I'm mistaken, that's the person in question right here.\" Just as he finished speaking, the door opened, and a young woman entered the room.",
          "paraphrase_gpt-4.1-2025-04-14": "\"Meanwhile,\" he said after a moment, during which he calmly smoked his pipe and watched the fire, \"you can't be accused of chasing drama, since many of the cases you have recorded aren't really criminal in the legal sense at all. The situation where I aided the King of Bohemia, Miss Mary Sutherland's unusual dilemma, the issue with the man with the twisted lip, and the story of the noble bachelor—all these fell outside what the law typically handles. Still, by steering clear of sensationalism, I worry you've come close to making things seem trivial.\"\n\n\"That might be so in the outcome,\" I responded, \"but I find the methods we've used to be fresh and intriguing.\"\n\n\"Ah, my friend, the public, that inattentive mass who would have trouble identifying a weaver by his teeth or a printer by his thumb, isn’t exactly interested in the finer points of logic and deduction. But honestly, if you're being trivial, I can't blame you—those grand, challenging cases are gone. These days, criminals lack ingenuity. My own practice seems to revolve around finding lost pencils and dispensing advice to girls from boarding schools. I think I’ve truly reached the lowest point. In fact, the letter I received this morning might just set a new low. Here, read it!\" He flung a crumpled note over to me.\n\nThe letter, from Montague Place and dated the previous evening, read:\n\n\"DEAR MR. HOLMES,—I am anxious to consult you about whether I should accept a governess position I’ve been offered. I’ll call on you at half-past ten tomorrow, if that’s convenient. Yours sincerely,\n\nVIOLET HUNTER.\"\n\n\"Do you know this young lady?\" I asked.\n\n\"No, I do not.\"\n\n\"It's half-past ten now.\"\n\n\"Yes, and I'd wager that’s her ringing the bell.\"\n\n\"It might prove more interesting than you expect. Remember how the blue carbuncle case at first seemed trivial, but turned into something serious? The same could be true here.\"\n\n\"Let’s hope so. But we won’t have long to wonder, because if I’m right, our visitor is here.\"\n\nJust then, the door opened and a young woman entered the room."

I shall be happy to do anything that I can to serve you.”\nI could see that Holmes was favourably impressed by the manner and speech of his new client. He looked her over in his searching fashion, and then composed himself, with his lids drooping and his finger-tips together, to listen to her story.\n“I have been a governess for five years,” said she, “in the family of Colonel Spence Munro, but two months ago the colonel received an appointment at Halifax, in Nova Scotia, and took his children over to America with him, so that I found myself without a situation. I advertised, and I answered advertisements, but without success. At last the little money which I had saved began to run short, and I was at my wit’s end as to what I should do.\n“There is a well-known agency for governesses in the West End called Westaway’s, and there I used to call about once a week in order to see whether anything had turned up which might suit me. Westaway was the name of the founder of the business, but it is really managed by Miss Stoper. She sits in her own little office, and the ladies who are seeking employment wait in an anteroom, and are then shown in one by one, when she consults her ledgers and sees whether she has anything which would suit them.\n“Well, when I called last week I was shown into the little office as usual, but I found that Miss Stoper was not alone. A prodigiously stout man with a very smiling face and a great heavy chin which rolled down in fold upon fold over his throat sat at her elbow with a pair of glasses on his nose, looking very earnestly at the ladies who entered. As I came in he gave quite a jump in his chair and turned quickly to Miss Stoper.\n“‘That will do,’ said he; ‘I could not ask for anything better. Capital! capital!’ He seemed quite enthusiastic and rubbed his hands together in the most genial fashion. He was such a comfortable-looking man that it was quite a pleasure to look at him.\n“‘You are looking for a situation, miss?’ he asked.\n“‘Yes, sir.’\n“‘As governess?’\n“‘Yes, sir.’\n“‘And what salary do you ask?’\n“‘I had £ 4 a month in my last place with Colonel Spence Munro.’\n“‘Oh, tut, tut! sweating—rank sweating!’ he cried, throwing his fat hands out into the air like a man who is in a boiling passion. ‘How could anyone offer so pitiful a sum to a lady with such attractions and accomplishments?’\n“‘My accomplishments, sir, may be less than you imagine,’ said I. ‘A little French, a little German, music, and drawing—’\n“‘Tut, tut!’ he cried. ‘This is all quite beside the question. The point is, have you or have you not the bearing and deportment of a lady? There it is in a nutshell. If you have not, you are not fitted for the rearing of a child who may some day play a considerable part in the history of the country. But if you have, why, then, how could any gentleman ask you to condescend to accept anything under the three figures? Your salary with me, madam, would commence at £ 100 a year.’\n“You may imagine, Mr. Holmes, that to me, destitute as I was, such an offer seemed almost too good to be true. The gentleman, however, seeing perhaps the look of incredulity upon my face, opened a pocket-book and took out a note.\n“‘It is also my custom,’ said he, smiling in the most pleasant fashion until his eyes were just two little shining slits amid the white creases of his face, ‘to advance to my young ladies half their salary beforehand, so that they may meet any little expenses of their journey and their wardrobe.’\n“It seemed to me that I had never met so fascinating and so thoughtful a man. As I was already in debt to my tradesmen, the advance was a great convenience, and yet there was something unnatural about the whole transaction which made me wish to know a little more before I quite committed myself.\n“‘May I ask where you live, sir?’ said I.\n“‘Hampshire. Charming rural place. The Copper Beeches, five miles on the far side of Winchester. It is the most lovely country, my dear young lady, and the dearest old country-house.’\n“‘And my duties, sir? I should be glad to know what they would be.’\n“‘One child—one dear little romper just six years old. Oh, if you could see him killing cockroaches with a slipper! Smack! smack! smack! Three gone before you could wink!’ He leaned back in his chair and laughed his eyes into his head again.\n“I was a little startled at the nature of the child’s amusement, but the father’s laughter made me think that perhaps he was joking.\n“‘My sole duties, then,’ I asked, ‘are to take charge of a single child?’\n“‘No, no, not the sole, not the sole, my dear young lady,’ he cried. ‘Your duty would be, as I am sure your good sense would suggest, to obey any little commands my wife might give, provided always that they were such commands as a lady might with propriety obey. You see no difficulty, heh?’\n“‘I should be happy to make myself useful.’\n“‘Quite so. In dress now, for example. We are faddy people, you know—faddy but kind-hearted. If you were asked to wear any dress which we might give you, you would not object to our little whim. Heh?’\n“‘No,’ said I, considerably astonished at his words.\n“‘Or to sit here, or sit there, that would not be offensive to you?’\n“‘Oh, no.’\n“‘Or to cut your hair quite short before you come to us?’\n“I could hardly believe my ears. As you may observe, Mr. Holmes, my hair is somewhat luxuriant, and of a rather peculiar tint of chestnut. It has been considered artistic. I could not dream of sacrificing it in this offhand fashion.\n“‘I am afraid that that is quite impossible,’ said I. He had been watching me eagerly out of his small eyes, and I could see a shadow pass over his face as I spoke.\n“‘I am afraid that it is quite essential,’ said he. ‘It is a little fancy of my wife’s, and ladies’ fancies, you know, madam, ladies’ fancies must be consulted. And so you won’t cut your hair?’\n“‘No, sir, I really could not,’ I answered firmly.\n“‘Ah, very well; then that quite settles the matter. It is a pity, because in other respects you would really have done very nicely. In that case, Miss Stoper, I had best inspect a few more of your young ladies.’\n“The manageress had sat all this while busy with her papers without a word to either of us, but she glanced at me now with so much annoyance upon her face that I could not help suspecting that she had lost a handsome commission through my refusal.\n“‘Do you desire your name to be kept upon the books?’ she asked.\n“‘If you please, Miss Stoper.’\n“‘Well, really, it seems rather useless, since you refuse the most excellent offers in this fashion,’ said she sharply. ‘You can hardly expect us to exert ourselves to find another such opening for you. Good-day to you, Miss Hunter.’ She struck a gong upon the table, and I was shown out by the page.",
          "paraphrase_gemini-2.5-flash-preview-04-17": "She was dressed simply but neatly, her face lively and alert, marked with freckles reminiscent of a plover's egg, and she carried herself with the confident energy of someone who had made her own way in the world. \"I trust you'll forgive my intrusion,\" she said as my companion stood to greet her, \"but I've encountered something very peculiar, and since I have no family to turn to for counsel, I hoped perhaps you might be good enough to advise me on what course to take.\" \"Please, take a seat, Miss Hunter. I'd be glad to assist you in any way I can.\" I could tell Holmes was positively impressed by the young woman's demeanor and articulation. He examined her intently, as was his custom, and then settled back, eyes half-closed, fingertips touching, ready to hear her account. \"For the past five years,\" she began, \"I worked as a governess for Colonel Spence Munro's family, but two months ago, the colonel was appointed to a post in Halifax, Nova Scotia, and took his children with him to America, leaving me unemployed. I advertised and responded to ads, but without success. Eventually, the small sum I had saved began to diminish rapidly, and I was completely at a loss about what to do.\" \"There's a well-known employment agency for governesses in the West End called Westaway's, and I made it a habit to visit about once a week to check if any suitable positions had become available. While the business was founded by someone named Westaway, it's actually run by Miss Stoper. She has her own small office, and the ladies seeking work wait in an adjoining room before being called in one by one, at which point she consults her records to see if she has anything appropriate for them.\" \"So, when I went there last week, I was shown into the little office as usual, but I noticed Miss Stoper wasn't alone. A remarkably large man with a very cheerful expression and a significant double chin that folded down over his neck was seated beside her, wearing glasses and watching the women who entered with great focus. When I came in, he actually jolted in his chair and quickly turned to Miss Stoper.\" \"'She'll do,' he declared; 'I couldn't ask for anyone better. Excellent! Excellent!' He seemed genuinely enthusiastic and rubbed his hands together warmly. He was such a pleasant-looking man that it was quite agreeable just to look at him.\" \"'Are you seeking employment, miss?' he inquired.\" \"'Yes, sir.'\" \"'As a governess?'\" \"'Yes, sir.'\" \"'And what salary are you requesting?'\" \"'In my last position with Colonel Spence Munro, I received £4 a month.'\" \"'Rubbish, rubbish! Exploitation—sheer exploitation!' he exclaimed, flinging his ample hands into the air like someone boiling with rage. 'How could anyone offer such a measly amount to a lady of your charm and capabilities?'\" \"'My capabilities, sir, might be less than you suppose,' I replied. 'A little French, a little German, music, and drawing—'\" \"'Nonsense, nonsense!' he interrupted. 'That's entirely beside the point. The crucial matter is, do you or do you not possess the demeanor and bearing of a lady? That's the essence of it. If you don't, you're unsuitable for raising a child who might one day play a significant role in the nation's history. But if you do, then how could any gentleman possibly expect you to accept anything less than three figures? Your salary with me, madam, would start at £100 a year.'\" \"You can imagine, Mr. Holmes, that to me, being without means, such an offer seemed almost unbelievable. The gentleman, however, perhaps noticing my skeptical expression, took a note from his pocket-book.\" \"'Furthermore, it is my practice,' he added, smiling so genuinely that his eyes narrowed to two small bright slits amidst the white creases on his face, 'to give my young ladies half their salary in advance, so they can cover any small costs for their journey and necessary clothing.'\" \"It struck me that I had never met such a kind and charming man. As I was already in debt to local shops, the advance was very helpful, yet there was something odd about the whole arrangement that made me want to know more before fully committing.\" \"'May I ask where you reside, sir?' I asked.\" \"'Hampshire. A lovely country spot. The Copper Beeches, located five miles beyond Winchester. It is the most beautiful countryside, my dear young lady, and a truly cherished old house.'\" \"'And my responsibilities, sir? I would appreciate knowing what they would entail.'\" \"'One child—just one precious little scamp, only six years old. Oh, if you could only see him hunting cockroaches with a slipper! Whack! Whack! Whack! Three gone in the blink of an eye!' He leaned back and laughed heartily until his eyes were almost lost in his face again.\" \"The nature of the child's pastime somewhat startled me, but the father's laughter led me to believe he might be jesting.\" \"'My only duties, then,' I clarified, 'are to look after a single child?'\" \"'No, no, not solely, not solely, my dear young lady,' he exclaimed. 'Your duty would be, as I'm sure your good sense suggests, to follow any minor instructions my wife might give, provided they are commands a lady could appropriately obey. You don't foresee any issue with that, do you?'\" \"'I would be happy to make myself useful.'\" \"'Quite so. Regarding clothing, for example. We have our peculiarities, you see—particular, but warm-hearted. If you were asked to wear a particular dress we might provide, you wouldn't object to our little peculiarity, would you?'\" \"'No,' I replied, considerably taken aback by his words.\" \"'Or sitting here, or sitting there—that wouldn't cause you offense?'\" \"'Oh, no.'\" \"'Or having your hair cut quite short before you join us?'\" \"I could barely believe what I was hearing. As you can observe, Mr. Holmes, my hair is rather thick and has a somewhat unusual shade of chestnut. It has been considered quite attractive. The thought of sacrificing it so casually was unthinkable.\" \"'I'm afraid that's quite impossible,' I said. He had been watching me intently with his small eyes, and I saw a shadow cross his face as I spoke.\" \"'I'm afraid it's absolutely necessary,' he stated. 'It's a small whim of my wife's, and as you know, madam, ladies' whims must be accommodated. So, you won't cut your hair?'\" \"'No, sir, I truly could not,' I answered firmly.\" \"'Ah, well then; that unfortunately settles the matter. It's a shame, because in other respects, you would have been perfectly suitable. In that case, Miss Stoper, I had better review a few more of your applicants.'\" \"The agency manageress had remained occupied with her paperwork the entire time without speaking to either of us, but she now cast a glance at me with such evident irritation that I couldn't help suspecting she had lost a substantial commission due to my refusal.\" \"'Do you wish your name to remain on the register?' she asked.\" \"'If you please, Miss Stoper.'\" \"'Well, honestly, it seems rather pointless, given how you reject such excellent offers,' she said sharply. 'You can hardly expect us to make an effort to find another such opportunity for you. Good day, Miss Hunter.' She struck a small gong on her desk, and the page showed me out.\"",
          "paraphrase_gpt-4.1-2025-04-14": "She wore simple but tidy clothes and had a lively, intelligent face, covered in freckles like a plover’s egg, and the energetic air of a woman accustomed to relying on herself. “Please forgive me for disturbing you,” she said as my companion stood up to welcome her. “I’ve just gone through something quite strange, and as I have no family to seek advice from, I hoped you might be willing to guide me.”\n\n“Please sit down, Miss Hunter. I’ll be glad to help in any way I can.”\n\nHolmes was clearly pleased by her demeanor and speech. He examined her thoroughly, then settled himself to listen, fingertips touching and eyelids lowered.\n\n“I’ve worked as a governess for five years,” she began, “with Colonel Spence Munro’s family, but two months ago the Colonel got a position in Halifax, Nova Scotia, and took his kids with him to America, leaving me out of work. I tried advertising and answering adverts for jobs, but nothing came of it. Eventually, my savings dwindled and I got quite desperate.\n\n“There’s a reputable governess agency in the West End called Westaway’s. I used to visit about once a week to see if they had anything for me. Though Mr. Westaway started it, Miss Stoper now manages it. She has her own small office, and job seekers wait in an anteroom to be called in individually while she checks her records for suitable openings.\n\n“Last week when I visited, I found Miss Stoper wasn’t alone. There was a very large, cheerful-looking man with a double chin beside her, glasses perched on his nose, watching each woman intently. As I entered, he jumped and turned to Miss Stoper.\n\n“‘That one will do,’ he said. ‘Perfect! Just what I want!’ He was clearly delighted, rubbing his hands together cheerfully. He had such a warm appearance he was almost a joy to behold.\n\n“‘Are you looking for a position, miss?’ he asked.\n\n“‘Yes, sir.’\n\n“‘As a governess?’\n\n“‘Yes, sir.’\n\n“‘And your previous salary?’\n\n“‘Four pounds a month with Colonel Spence Munro.’\n\n“‘Tut tut! That’s shameful exploitation!’ he cried, waving his hands like an indignant man. ‘How could anyone offer so little to a lady so accomplished and attractive?’\n\n“‘My skills may not be as great as you think,’ I said. ‘Some French, some German, music, and drawing—’\n\n“‘Nonsense!’ he interrupted. ‘That’s not even the point. What matters is whether you have the behavior and manners of a lady. That’s the key. If not, you cannot teach a child who could once be important. But if you do, you should never accept less than three digits! I would start you at £100 a year.’\n\n“You can imagine, Mr. Holmes, how tempting this seemed to me, being near penniless. The gentleman, noticing my disbelief, took out a wallet and produced a note.\n\n“‘I always advance my young ladies half their first year’s salary,’ he smiled, his eyes narrowing amid his many facial creases, ‘so they can handle any travel or clothing expenses.’\n\n“He was charming and considerate, and since I owed money to my shopkeepers, this advance was helpful—though something felt strange about the whole encounter, and I wanted more information before agreeing.\n\n“‘May I ask where you live, sir?’\n\n“‘Hampshire. A delightful rural area. The Copper Beeches, five miles from Winchester. A beautiful old country house.’\n\n“‘And my duties?’ I asked.\n\n“‘One child—a spirited six-year-old. Oh, if you could see him smashing cockroaches with a slipper! Smack! Smack! Three gone in a blink!’ He leaned back, laughing heartily.\n\n“I was slightly unsettled by the child’s pastimes, but the man’s laughter made me wonder if he was joking.\n\n“‘So my only job is caring for the child?’\n\n“‘Not only that, not just that,’ he replied quickly. ‘You’ll also follow any reasonable requests my wife may make, as long as they’re proper. That’s not a problem, is it?’\n\n“‘I would be glad to be helpful.’\n\n“‘Exactly. With your clothing, for example. We have our little quirks—eccentric but kind. If we asked you to wear a certain outfit, you wouldn’t mind indulging us, would you?’\n\n“‘No,’ I answered, rather surprised.\n\n“‘Or sit in certain places, that wouldn’t offend you?’\n\n“‘Not at all.’\n\n“‘Or cut your hair quite short before coming?’\n\n“I was shocked. As you see, Mr. Holmes, my hair is thick and a unique chestnut shade, considered quite artistic. I couldn’t imagine cutting it so suddenly.\n\n“‘I’m sorry, that’s impossible,’ I said. He’d been watching me closely, and I saw disappointment flicker over his face.\n\n“‘I’m afraid it’s essential,’ he insisted. ‘My wife insists on it, and ladies’ wishes must be respected. So you won’t cut your hair?’\n\n“‘No, sir, I really can’t,’ I replied firmly.\n\n“‘Well, that’s that. Pity—you would have been a wonderful fit otherwise. Miss Stoper, please show me some more candidates.’\n\n“Miss Stoper, who’d been busy with her paperwork, shot me a look of annoyance, and I suspected she was upset at losing a good commission due to my refusal.\n\n“‘Shall I keep your name in our records?’ she asked.\n\n“‘Yes, please, Miss Stoper.’\n\n“‘Well, it seems pointless, since you decline excellent offers like this,’ she said sharply. ‘You can’t expect us to find another as good for you. Good day, Miss Hunter.’ She rang a bell, and the page showed me out."

After all, if these people had strange fads and expected obedience on the most extraordinary matters, they were at least ready to pay for their eccentricity. Very few governesses in England are getting £ 100 a year. Besides, what use was my hair to me? Many people are improved by wearing it short and perhaps I should be among the number.

My wife is very anxious that you should come, for she has been much attracted by my description of you. We are willing to give £ 30 a quarter, or £ 120 a year, so as to recompense you for any little inconvenience which our fads may cause you. They are not very exacting, after all. My wife is fond of a particular shade of electric blue and would like you to wear such a dress indoors in the morning. You need not, however, go to the expense of purchasing one, as we have one belonging to my dear daughter Alice (now in Philadelphia), which would, I should think, fit you very well. Then, as to sitting here or there, or amusing yourself in any manner indicated, that need cause you no inconvenience. As regards your hair, it is no doubt a pity, especially as I could not help remarking its beauty during our short interview, but I am afraid that I must remain firm upon this point, and I only hope that the increased salary may recompense you for the loss. Your duties, as far as the child is concerned, are very light. Now do try to come, and I shall meet you with the dog-cart at Winchester. Let me know your train. Yours faithfully,\n“‘JEPHRO RUCASTLE.’\n“That is the letter which I have just received, Mr. Holmes, and my mind is made up that I will accept it. I thought, however, that before taking the final step I should like to submit the whole matter to your consideration.”\n“Well, Miss Hunter, if your mind is made up, that settles the question,” said Holmes, smiling.\n“But you would not advise me to refuse?”\n“I confess that it is not the situation which I should like to see a sister of mine apply for.”\n“What is the meaning of it all, Mr. Holmes?”\n“Ah, I have no data. I cannot tell. Perhaps you have yourself formed some opinion?”\n“Well, there seems to me to be only one possible solution. Mr. Rucastle seemed to be a very kind, good-natured man. Is it not possible that his wife is a lunatic, that he desires to keep the matter quiet for fear she should be taken to an asylum, and that he humours her fancies in every way in order to prevent an outbreak?”\n“That is a possible solution—in fact, as matters stand, it is the most probable one. But in any case it does not seem to be a nice household for a young lady.”\n“But the money, Mr. Holmes, the money!”\n“Well, yes, of course the pay is good—too good. That is what makes me uneasy. Why should they give you £ 120 a year, when they could have their pick for £ 40? There must be some strong reason behind.”\n“I thought that if I told you the circumstances you would understand afterwards if I wanted your help. I should feel so much stronger if I felt that you were at the back of me.”\n“Oh, you may carry that feeling away with you. I assure you that your little problem promises to be the most interesting which has come my way for some months. There is something distinctly novel about some of the features. If you should find yourself in doubt or in danger—”\n“Danger! What danger do you foresee?”\nHolmes shook his head gravely. “It would cease to be a danger if we could define it,” said he. “But at any time, day or night, a telegram would bring me down to your help.”\n“That is enough.” She rose briskly from her chair with the anxiety all swept from her face. “I shall go down to Hampshire quite easy in my mind now. I shall write to Mr. Rucastle at once, sacrifice my poor hair to-night, and start for Winchester to-morrow.” With a few grateful words to Holmes she bade us both good-night and bustled off upon her way.\n“At least,” said I as we heard her quick, firm steps descending the stairs, “she seems to be a young lady who is very well able to take care of herself.”\n“And she would need to be,” said Holmes gravely. “I am much mistaken if we do not hear from her before many days are past.”",

Very few governesses in England earn £100 a year. Furthermore, what purpose did my hair serve? Many people look better with short hair, and perhaps I would too. The next day, I was inclined to believe I had erred, and by the day after, I was convinced.

However, I felt that before taking the final step, I should present the entire situation for your consideration.\n\n'Well, Miss Hunter, if your mind is set, that resolves the issue,' Holmes said, smiling.\n\n'But you wouldn't advise me against accepting?'\n\n'I must confess that it is not a position I would wish a sister of mine to apply for.'\n\n'What could be the explanation for all this, Mr. Holmes?'\n\n'Ah, I have no information yet. I cannot say. Perhaps you yourself have formed a theory?'\n\n'Well, the only possible explanation that occurs to me is this: Mr. Rucastle seemed like a very kind, good-natured man. Is it not possible that his wife is mentally unstable, that he wishes to keep this quiet to avoid her being sent to an asylum, and that he indulges her fancies in every way to prevent a breakdown?'\n\n'That is a possible explanation—in fact, as things stand, it is the most likely one. But in any case, it doesn't appear to be a pleasant household for a young woman.'\n\n'But the money, Mr. Holmes, the money!'\n\n'Well, yes, of course the pay is excellent—too excellent. That is precisely what makes me uneasy. Why would they offer you £120 a year when they could have their pick of applicants for £40? There must be a significant underlying motive.'\n\n'I thought that if I explained the circumstances to you, you would understand later if I required your assistance. I would feel much stronger knowing you were supporting me.'\n\n'Oh, you can certainly take that feeling with you. I assure you, your little problem promises to be the most engaging I have encountered in several months. There is something distinctly original about some of the details. Should you ever find yourself uncertain or in danger—'\n\n'Danger! What danger do you foresee?'\n\nHolmes shook his head seriously. 'It would cease to be a danger if we could define it beforehand,' he said. 'But at any time, day or night, a telegram would bring me instantly to your aid.'\n\n'That is enough.' She rose quickly from her chair, the worry completely gone from her face. 'I shall go down to Hampshire with perfect peace of mind now. I will write to Mr. Rucastle immediately, sacrifice my hair tonight, and depart for Winchester tomorrow.' With a few grateful words to Holmes, she bade us both goodnight and bustled away.\n\n'At least,' I remarked as we heard her quick, firm steps descending the stairs, 'she seems to be a young lady quite capable of looking after herself.'\n\n'And she will need to be,' said Holmes gravely. 'I shall be very surprised if we do not hear from her again before many days have passed.'",

These people might have odd preferences and demand strict obedience about unusual things, but at least they were offering to pay well for it. Not many governesses in England earn £100 a year. And really, was my hair so useful? Some people look better with short hair, maybe I would as well. The next day I started to regret my decision, and soon I was certain I'd made a mistake. I was about to swallow my pride and return to the agency to see if the position was still available when I received a letter from Mr. Rucastle himself. Let me read it to you:\n\n‘The Copper Beeches, near Winchester.\nDear Miss Hunter,—Miss Stoper kindly gave me your address. I am writing to see if you have changed your mind. My wife is eager for your arrival, as she was very taken with my account of you. We are willing to pay £30 per quarter, or £120 a year, to compensate you for any inconvenience our oddities may cause. Truly, they are not so demanding. My wife particularly likes a certain shade of electric blue and would like you to wear such a dress indoors in the mornings. You don’t need to buy one; we have one that belonged to our daughter Alice (now in Philadelphia), and it should fit you. Concerning where you sit or how you amuse yourself in ways we direct, that shouldn’t trouble you.

However, before I finalize things, I wanted your advice.”\n\nHolmes responded, “If you’ve made your mind up, then that’s that.”\n\n“But would you advise me to decline?”\n\n“Honestly, it’s not the kind of job I’d like to see my own sister take.”\n\n“What does it all mean, Mr. Holmes?”\n\n“I don’t know. I lack facts. Maybe you’ve come up with a theory?”\n\n“Well, it seems there’s only one explanation. Mr. Rucastle appeared very nice and kind. Maybe his wife is insane, and he wants to keep it a secret so she isn’t sent to an asylum, so he caters to her whims to keep peace?”\n\n“That’s possible, and actually the most likely scenario. Still, it doesn’t sound like a good place for a young woman.”\n\n“But the money, Mr. Holmes!”\n\n“Yes, the pay is excellent—too good, even. That makes me suspicious. Why offer £120 a year when they could hire someone for £40? There must be a strong reason.”\n\n“I thought if I explained the situation, you’d understand if I later needed your help. I’d feel much better knowing I had your support.”\n\n“Oh, you do. Your little problem looks like it could be the most interesting case I’ve had in months. Some aspects are truly unique. If you are ever confused or in danger—”\n\n“Danger! What danger do you mean?”\n\nHolmes shook his head seriously. “If we could name it, it wouldn’t be a danger. But if you need me at any time, just send a telegram and I’ll come immediately.”\n\n“That’s enough.” She got up, now looking calm. “I shall go to Hampshire without worry now. I’ll write to Mr. Rucastle straight away, cut my hair tonight, and leave for Winchester tomorrow.” She thanked Holmes warmly and said goodnight.\n\n“At least,” I remarked as we heard her quick steps down the stairs, “she seems very capable of looking after herself.”\n\n“And she’ll need to be,” said Holmes gravely. “I’m quite sure we’ll hear from her soon.”"

          "text_segment": "It was not very long before my friend’s prediction was fulfilled. A fortnight went by, during which I frequently found my thoughts turning in her direction and wondering what strange side-alley of human experience this lonely woman had strayed into. The unusual salary, the curious conditions, the light duties, all pointed to something abnormal, though whether a fad or a plot, or whether the man were a philanthropist or a villain, it was quite beyond my powers to determine. As to Holmes, I observed that he sat frequently for half an hour on end, with knitted brows and an abstracted air, but he swept the matter away with a wave of his hand when I mentioned it. “Data! data! data!” he cried impatiently. “I can’t make bricks without clay.” And yet he would always wind up by muttering that no sister of his should ever have accepted such a situation.\nThe telegram which we eventually received came late one night just as I was thinking of turning in and Holmes was settling down to one of those all-night chemical researches which he frequently indulged in, when I would leave him stooping over a retort and a test-tube at night and find him in the same position when I came down to breakfast in the morning. He opened the yellow envelope, and then, glancing at the message, threw it across to me.\n“Just look up the trains in Bradshaw,” said he, and turned back to his chemical studies.\nThe summons was a brief and urgent one.\n“Please be at the Black Swan Hotel at Winchester at midday to-morrow,” it said. “Do come! I am at my wit’s end.\n“HUNTER.”\n“Will you come with me?” asked Holmes, glancing up.\n“I should wish to.”\n“Just look it up, then.”\n“There is a train at half-past nine,” said I, glancing over my Bradshaw. “It is due at Winchester at 11:30.”\n“That will do very nicely. Then perhaps I had better postpone my analysis of the acetones, as we may need to be at our best in the morning.”\nBy eleven o’clock the next day we were well upon our way to the old English capital. Holmes had been buried in the morning papers all the way down, but after we had passed the Hampshire border he threw them down and began to admire the scenery. It was an ideal spring day, a light blue sky, flecked with little fleecy white clouds drifting across from west to east. The sun was shining very brightly, and yet there was an exhilarating nip in the air, which set an edge to a man’s energy. All over the countryside, away to the rolling hills around Aldershot, the little red and grey roofs of the farm-steadings peeped out from amid the light green of the new foliage.\n“Are they not fresh and beautiful?” I cried with all the enthusiasm of a man fresh from the fogs of Baker Street.\nBut Holmes shook his head gravely.\n“Do you know, Watson,” said he, “that it is one of the curses of a mind with a turn like mine that I must look at everything with reference to my own special subject. You look at these scattered houses, and you are impressed by their beauty. I look at them, and the only thought which comes to me is a feeling of their isolation and of the impunity with which crime may be committed there.”\n“Good heavens!” I cried. “Who would associate crime with these dear old homesteads?”\n“They always fill me with a certain horror. It is my belief, Watson, founded upon my experience, that the lowest and vilest alleys in London do not present a more dreadful record of sin than does the smiling and beautiful countryside.”\n“You horrify me!”\n“But the reason is very obvious. The pressure of public opinion can do in the town what the law cannot accomplish. There is no lane so vile that the scream of a tortured child, or the thud of a drunkard’s blow, does not beget sympathy and indignation among the neighbours, and then the whole machinery of justice is ever so close that a word of complaint can set it going, and there is but a step between the crime and the dock. But look at these lonely houses, each in its own fields, filled for the most part with poor ignorant folk who know little of the law. Think of the deeds of hellish cruelty, the hidden wickedness which may go on, year in, year out, in such places, and none the wiser. Had this lady who appeals to us for help gone to live in Winchester, I should never have had a fear for her. It is the five miles of country which makes the danger. Still, it is clear that she is not personally threatened.”\n“No. If she can come to Winchester to meet us she can get away.”\n“Quite so. She has her freedom.”\n“What can be the matter, then? Can you suggest no explanation?”\n“I have devised seven separate explanations, each of which would cover the facts as far as we know them. But which of these is correct can only be determined by the fresh information which we shall no doubt find waiting for us. Well, there is the tower of the cathedral, and we shall soon learn all that Miss Hunter has to tell.”",
          "paraphrase_gemini-2.5-flash-preview-04-17": "It wasn't long before my friend's prediction came true. Two weeks passed, during which I often thought about this solitary woman, wondering what strange path in life she had taken. The unusually high pay, odd conditions, and light duties all suggested something abnormal, though I couldn't figure out if it was a quirky whim, a planned scheme, or if the employer was charitable or wicked. As for Holmes, he frequently sat absorbed in thought, looking abstracted, but he dismissed the matter when I brought it up. 'Facts! Facts! Facts!' he'd exclaim impatiently. 'I can't build without raw material.' Yet, he would always conclude by saying his sister should never have accepted such a position. We eventually received the telegram late one night, just as I was preparing for bed and Holmes was starting one of his typical all-night chemistry experiments; I often left him hunched over his equipment at night and found him in the same spot the next morning. He opened the yellow envelope, read the message, and tossed it to me. 'Check the train times in Bradshaw,' he instructed, returning to his work. The message was short and urgent: 'Please meet me at the Black Swan Hotel in Winchester tomorrow at midday. Do come! I'm desperate. HUNTER.' 'Will you join me?' Holmes asked, looking up. 'Certainly.' 'Then find the details.' 'There's a train at nine-thirty,' I said after consulting my Bradshaw. 'It's scheduled to arrive in Winchester at eleven-thirty.' 'That will be perfect. Perhaps I should postpone my acetone analysis, as we may need to be sharp in the morning.' By eleven o'clock the following day, we were well on our way to the ancient English city. Holmes was engrossed in the morning papers for most of the journey, but after we crossed into Hampshire, he put them down and began to appreciate the scenery. It was a perfect spring day, with a clear blue sky dotted with small, fluffy white clouds drifting eastwards. The sun shone brightly, but there was a bracing chill in the air that invigorated one. Across the countryside, stretching to the rolling hills near Aldershot, the small red and grey roofs of farm buildings peered out from the fresh green new leaves. 'Aren't they lovely and vibrant?' I exclaimed, with the enthusiasm of someone used to the fogs of Baker Street. But Holmes shook his head soberly. 'You know, Watson,' he said, 'it's a disadvantage of a mind like mine that I must relate everything to my specific field. You see these scattered homes and are struck by their beauty. I see them, and the only thought that occurs to me is their isolation and how easily crimes might be committed there unnoticed.' 'Good heavens!' I cried. 'Who could associate crime with these pleasant old homes?' 'They always fill me with a certain dread. It's my belief, Watson, based on experience, that the foulest parts of London don't show a more terrible history of sin than the seemingly peaceful and beautiful countryside.' 'You appal me!' 'But the reason is quite clear. Public pressure achieves in the city what the law cannot. There is no alley so awful that a child's scream or a drunkard's blow won't stir sympathy and anger among neighbours, and the justice system is so close by that a mere complaint can set it in motion, with swift consequences from crime to arrest. But consider these isolated houses, each on its own land, mostly inhabited by simple people with little knowledge of the law. Imagine the horrific cruelties, the hidden evil that might occur year after year in such places, with no one ever finding out. Had this lady who needs our help chosen to live in Winchester, I wouldn't have worried for her. It's the five miles of countryside that creates the danger. Still, it's evident she isn't personally threatened.' 'No. If she can travel to Winchester to meet us, she can escape.' 'Exactly. She is free.' 'What, then, could be the problem? Can you suggest any explanation?' 'I've developed seven different theories, each covering the facts as we currently understand them. But determining which is correct can only be done with the new information we will undoubtedly receive. Well, there is the cathedral tower, and we will soon learn all that Miss Hunter has to tell us.'",
          "paraphrase_gpt-4.1-2025-04-14": "It wasn’t long before Holmes’s prediction came true. Two weeks passed, and during this time I often found myself thinking about her and wondering what unusual path her life had taken. The generous pay, odd requirements, and easy work all suggested something out of the ordinary—though whether just peculiar or something more sinister, I couldn’t tell. As for Holmes, I noticed he would sit lost in thought for long stretches, but if I brought up the matter, he’d dismiss it, saying, “Data! data! data! I can’t make bricks without clay.” Still, he always mumbled that he wouldn’t want any sister of his to accept such a position.\n\nLate one night, when I was preparing for bed and Holmes was about to start one of his all-night experiments, a telegram arrived. Holmes opened and read it, then handed it to me:\n\n“Please be at the Black Swan Hotel at Winchester at midday to-morrow. Do come! I am at my wit’s end.\nHUNTER.”\n\nHolmes asked if I’d accompany him. I agreed, found that a train at 9:30 would get us to Winchester by 11:30, and Holmes decided to put off his experiments so we’d be ready in the morning.\n\nBy eleven the next day we were on our way. Holmes read the morning papers during the ride, but after we crossed into Hampshire, he put them aside and admired the scenery. It was a perfect spring day, the sky blue with puffy clouds, sunshine bright but the air still brisk and energizing. Red and gray farmhouses dotted the fields among the fresh, green leaves.\n\nI commented on their beauty, but Holmes replied solemnly that, given his profession, he couldn’t help but see them as isolated places where crime could go undetected. He explained that in cities, public scrutiny and the closeness of law enforcement make crime hard to conceal, whereas in the countryside, lonely houses may hide terrible suffering and wrongdoing without anyone knowing. He said he wouldn’t have worried about our client if she’d stayed in Winchester, but the country setting posed dangers. Still, he reasoned, since she could come to meet us, she must be free and not in immediate danger.\n\nI asked if he could guess what was wrong. Holmes answered that he had thought of seven possible explanations, but only new facts would reveal the truth. As we drew near Winchester, he noted the cathedral tower in the distance, saying we’d soon learn everything from Miss Hunter."

She had engaged a sitting-room, and our lunch awaited us upon the table.\n“I am so delighted that you have come,” she said earnestly. “It is so very kind of you both; but indeed I do not know what I should do. Your advice will be altogether invaluable to me.”\n“Pray tell us what has happened to you.”\n“I will do so, and I must be quick, for I have promised Mr. Rucastle to be back before three. I got his leave to come into town this morning, though he little knew for what purpose.”\n“Let us have everything in its due order.” Holmes thrust his long thin legs out towards the fire and composed himself to listen.\n“In the first place, I may say that I have met, on the whole, with no actual ill-treatment from Mr. and Mrs. Rucastle. It is only fair to them to say that. But I cannot understand them, and I am not easy in my mind about them.”\n“What can you not understand?”\n“Their reasons for their conduct. But you shall have it all just as it occurred. When I came down, Mr. Rucastle met me here and drove me in his dog-cart to the Copper Beeches. It is, as he said, beautifully situated, but it is not beautiful in itself, for it is a large square block of a house, whitewashed, but all stained and streaked with damp and bad weather. There are grounds round it, woods on three sides, and on the fourth a field which slopes down to the Southampton high road, which curves past about a hundred yards from the front door. This ground in front belongs to the house, but the woods all round are part of Lord Southerton’s preserves. A clump of copper beeches immediately in front of the hall door has given its name to the place.\n“I was driven over by my employer, who was as amiable as ever, and was introduced by him that evening to his wife and the child. There was no truth, Mr. Holmes, in the conjecture which seemed to us to be probable in your rooms at Baker Street. Mrs. Rucastle is not mad. I found her to be a silent, pale-faced woman, much younger than her husband, not more than thirty, I should think, while he can hardly be less than forty-five. From their conversation I have gathered that they have been married about seven years, that he was a widower, and that his only child by the first wife was the daughter who has gone to Philadelphia. Mr. Rucastle told me in private that the reason why she had left them was that she had an unreasoning aversion to her stepmother. As the daughter could not have been less than twenty, I can quite imagine that her position must have been uncomfortable with her father’s young wife.\n“Mrs. Rucastle seemed to me to be colourless in mind as well as in feature. She impressed me neither favourably nor the reverse. She was a nonentity. It was easy to see that she was passionately devoted both to her husband and to her little son. Her light grey eyes wandered continually from one to the other, noting every little want and forestalling it if possible. He was kind to her also in his bluff, boisterous fashion, and on the whole they seemed to be a happy couple. And yet she had some secret sorrow, this woman. She would often be lost in deep thought, with the saddest look upon her face. More than once I have surprised her in tears. I have thought sometimes that it was the disposition of her child which weighed upon her mind, for I have never met so utterly spoiled and so ill-natured a little creature. He is small for his age, with a head which is quite disproportionately large. His whole life appears to be spent in an alternation between savage fits of passion and gloomy intervals of sulking. Giving pain to any creature weaker than himself seems to be his one idea of amusement, and he shows quite remarkable talent in planning the capture of mice, little birds, and insects. But I would rather not talk about the creature, Mr. Holmes, and, indeed, he has little to do with my story.”\n“I am glad of all details,” remarked my friend, “whether they seem to you to be relevant or not.”\n“I shall try not to miss anything of importance. The one unpleasant thing about the house, which struck me at once, was the appearance and conduct of the servants. There are only two, a man and his wife. Toller, for that is his name, is a rough, uncouth man, with grizzled hair and whiskers, and a perpetual smell of drink. Twice since I have been with them he has been quite drunk, and yet Mr. Rucastle seemed to take no notice of it. His wife is a very tall and strong woman with a sour face, as silent as Mrs. Rucastle and much less amiable. They are a most unpleasant couple, but fortunately I spend most of my time in the nursery and my own room, which are next to each other in one corner of the building.\n“For two days after my arrival at the Copper Beeches my life was very quiet; on the third, Mrs. Rucastle came down just after breakfast and whispered something to her husband.\n“‘Oh, yes,’ said he, turning to me, ‘we are very much obliged to you, Miss Hunter, for falling in with our whims so far as to cut your hair. I assure you that it has not detracted in the tiniest iota from your appearance. We shall now see how the electric-blue dress will become you. You will find it laid out upon the bed in your room, and if you would be so good as to put it on we should both be extremely obliged.’\n“The dress which I found waiting for me was of a peculiar shade of blue. It was of excellent material, a sort of beige, but it bore unmistakable signs of having been worn before. It could not have been a better fit if I had been measured for it. Both Mr. and Mrs. Rucastle expressed a delight at the look of it, which seemed quite exaggerated in its vehemence. They were waiting for me in the drawing-room, which is a very large room, stretching along the entire front of the house, with three long windows reaching down to the floor. A chair had been placed close to the central window, with its back turned towards it. In this I was asked to sit, and then Mr. Rucastle, walking up and down on the other side of the room, began to tell me a series of the funniest stories that I have ever listened to. You cannot imagine how comical he was, and I laughed until I was quite weary. Mrs. Rucastle, however, who has evidently no sense of humour, never so much as smiled, but sat with her hands in her lap, and a sad, anxious look upon her face. After an hour or so, Mr. Rucastle suddenly remarked that it was time to commence the duties of the day, and that I might change my dress and go to little Edward in the nursery.\n“Two days later this same performance was gone through under exactly similar circumstances. Again I changed my dress, again I sat in the window, and again I laughed very heartily at the funny stories of which my employer had an immense répertoire, and which he told inimitably. Then he handed me a yellow-backed novel, and moving my chair a little sideways, that my own shadow might not fall upon the page, he begged me to read aloud to him. I read for about ten minutes, beginning in the heart of a chapter, and then suddenly, in the middle of a sentence, he ordered me to cease and to change my dress.\n“You can easily imagine, Mr. Holmes, how curious I became as to what the meaning of this extraordinary performance could possibly be. They were always very careful, I observed, to turn my face away from the window, so that I became consumed with the desire to see what was going on behind my back. At first it seemed to be impossible, but I soon devised a means. My hand-mirror had been broken, so a happy thought seized me, and I concealed a piece of the glass in my handkerchief. On the next occasion, in the midst of my laughter, I put my handkerchief up to my eyes, and was able with a little management to see all that there was behind me. I confess that I was disappointed. There was nothing. At least that was my first impression. At the second glance, however, I perceived that there was a man standing in the Southampton Road, a small bearded man in a grey suit, who seemed to be looking in my direction. The road is an important highway, and there are usually people there. This man, however, was leaning against the railings which bordered our field and was looking earnestly up. I lowered my handkerchief and glanced at Mrs. Rucastle to find her eyes fixed upon me with a most searching gaze. She said nothing, but I am convinced that she had divined that I had a mirror in my hand and had seen what was behind me. She rose at once.\n“‘Jephro,’ said she, ‘there is an impertinent fellow upon the road there who stares up at Miss Hunter.’\n“‘No friend of yours, Miss Hunter?’ he asked.\n“‘No, I know no one in these parts.’\n“‘Dear me! How very impertinent! Kindly turn round and motion to him to go away.’\n“‘Surely it would be better to take no notice.’\n“‘No, no, we should have him loitering here always. Kindly turn round and wave him away like that.’\n“I did as I was told, and at the same instant Mrs. Rucastle drew down the blind. That was a week ago, and from that time I have not sat again in the window, nor have I worn the blue dress, nor seen the man in the road.”\n“Pray continue,” said Holmes. “Your narrative promises to be a most interesting one.”\n“You will find it rather disconnected, I fear, and there may prove to be little relation between the different incidents of which I speak. On the very first day that I was at the Copper Beeches, Mr. Rucastle took me to a small outhouse which stands near the kitchen door. As we approached it I heard the sharp rattling of a chain, and the sound as of a large animal moving about.\n“‘Look in here!’ said Mr. Rucastle, showing me a slit between two planks. ‘Is he not a beauty?’\n“I looked through and was conscious of two glowing eyes, and of a vague figure huddled up in the darkness.\n“‘Don’t be frightened,’ said my employer, laughing at the start which I had given. ‘It’s only Carlo, my mastiff. I call him mine, but really old Toller, my groom, is the only man who can do anything with him. We feed him once a day, and not too much then, so that he is always as keen as mustard. Toller lets him loose every night, and God help the trespasser whom he lays his fangs upon. For goodness’ sake don’t you ever on any pretext set your foot over the threshold at night, for it’s as much as your life is worth.’\n“The warning was no idle one, for two nights later I happened to look out of my bedroom window about two o’clock in the morning. It was a beautiful moonlight night, and the lawn in front of the house was silvered over and almost as bright as day. I was standing, rapt in the peaceful beauty of the scene, when I was aware that something was moving under the shadow of the copper beeches. As it emerged into the moonshine I saw what it was. It was a giant dog, as large as a calf, tawny tinted, with hanging jowl, black muzzle, and huge projecting bones. It walked slowly across the lawn and vanished into the shadow upon the other side. That dreadful sentinel sent a chill to my heart which I do not think that any burglar could have done.\n“And now I have a very strange experience to tell you. I had, as you know, cut off my hair in London, and I had placed it in a great coil at the bottom of my trunk. One evening, after the child was in bed, I began to amuse myself by examining the furniture of my room and by rearranging my own little things. There was an old chest of drawers in the room, the two upper ones empty and open, the lower one locked. I had filled the first two with my linen, and as I had still much to pack away I was naturally annoyed at not having the use of the third drawer. It struck me that it might have been fastened by a mere oversight, so I took out my bunch of keys and tried to open it. The very first key fitted to perfection, and I drew the drawer open. There was only one thing in it, but I am sure that you would never guess what it was. It was my coil of hair.\n“I took it up and examined it. It was of the same peculiar tint, and the same thickness. But then the impossibility of the thing obtruded itself upon me. How could my hair have been locked in the drawer? With trembling hands I undid my trunk, turned out the contents, and drew from the bottom my own hair. I laid the two tresses together, and I assure you that they were identical. Was it not extraordinary? Puzzle as I would, I could make nothing at all of what it meant. I returned the strange hair to the drawer, and I said nothing of the matter to the Rucastles as I felt that I had put myself in the wrong by opening a drawer which they had locked.",
          "paraphrase_gemini-2.5-flash-preview-04-17": "We found the young lady, Miss Hunter, waiting for us at The Black Swan, a well-regarded inn situated near the station on High Street. She had reserved a sitting-room, and our lunch was ready on the table. She expressed her great relief at our arrival, saying sincerely, \"I am so delighted that you have come. It is so very kind of you both; but indeed I do not know what I should do. Your advice will be altogether invaluable to me.\" When invited to explain what had happened, she agreed but noted she had to be quick as she had promised Mr. Rucastle she would return by three o'clock, having received his permission to visit town that morning without him knowing her true purpose. Holmes encouraged her to tell the story in order, stretching out his long legs towards the fire and settling in to listen. Miss Hunter began by stating that, overall, she hadn't experienced actual mistreatment from Mr. and Mrs. Rucastle, acknowledging this was only fair to say. However, she found them baffling and felt uneasy about them. Asked what she couldn't understand, she replied it was the reasons behind their actions, promising to recount everything exactly as it occurred. She explained that Mr. Rucastle had met her at the station upon her arrival and driven her to the Copper Beeches in his dog-cart. While he accurately described its beautiful location, the house itself wasn't attractive; it was a large, square, whitewashed building marked and discolored by dampness and the weather. It was surrounded by grounds, with woods on three sides and a field sloping down to the Southampton high road on the fourth. The road curved past about a hundred yards from the front door, and the land immediately in front belonged to the house, while the surrounding woods were part of Lord Southerton’s estate. The place got its name from a cluster of copper beeches right in front of the main entrance. Her employer drove her there and introduced her to his wife and child that evening, remaining as pleasant as ever. She confirmed that the idea discussed earlier in Baker Street, that Mrs. Rucastle might be insane, was incorrect. Mrs. Rucastle was a quiet, pale woman who appeared much younger than her husband, likely around thirty, whereas he seemed at least forty-five. Their conversation suggested they had been married about seven years, and Mr. Rucastle had been a widower whose only daughter from his first marriage was the one now in Philadelphia. Mr. Rucastle had privately explained his daughter left because she had an irrational dislike for her stepmother. Given the daughter was at least twenty, Miss Hunter could understand her position being awkward with her father’s young wife. Mrs. Rucastle struck her as unremarkable, both in appearance and personality, a 'nonentity'. Yet, it was clear she deeply loved her husband and young son, constantly watching them with her light grey eyes, anticipating their needs. Mr. Rucastle was also kind to her in his rough, energetic way, and they seemed generally content together. Despite this, Mrs. Rucastle appeared to carry a hidden sorrow, often lost in thought with a sad expression, and Miss Hunter had found her crying more than once. She sometimes wondered if the child's temperament was the cause of her sadness, as she had never encountered such a thoroughly spoiled and unpleasant child. He was small for his age with a disproportionately large head, spending his time alternating between furious outbursts and sullen periods. His main source of fun seemed to be inflicting pain on weaker creatures, showing considerable skill in catching mice, birds, and insects. Miss Hunter preferred not to dwell on the child, stating he wasn't central to her story. Holmes interjected that he welcomed all details, whether she considered them relevant or not. She promised to try not to omit anything significant. One immediate source of unpleasantness in the house was the appearance and behavior of the servants. There were only two, a man named Toller and his wife. Toller was a rough, unrefined man with grey hair and whiskers and a constant smell of alcohol. He had been visibly drunk twice since she arrived, yet Mr. Rucastle seemed to ignore it. His wife was a very tall, strong woman with a stern face, as silent as Mrs. Rucastle but less pleasant. They were a highly disagreeable couple, but fortunately, Miss Hunter spent most of her time in the nursery and her own adjacent room, both located in one corner of the house. Her first two days at the Copper Beeches were quiet. On the third day, shortly after breakfast, Mrs. Rucastle spoke quietly to her husband. He then turned to Miss Hunter, saying they were grateful she had gone along with their strange request to cut her hair, assuring her it hadn't lessened her appearance at all. He added that they now wanted to see how she looked in the electric-blue dress, which she would find laid out in her room, and they would be very grateful if she would put it on. The dress was a distinctive shade of blue, made of excellent material (a type of beige), but showed clear signs of having been worn before. It fit her perfectly, as if tailored for her. Both Mr. and Mrs. Rucastle expressed an excessively strong delight at how she looked in it. They were waiting for her in the drawing-room, a large room spanning the house's entire front, with three long windows reaching the floor. A chair had been placed near the central window, facing away from it. She was asked to sit there, and Mr. Rucastle began telling her a series of the funniest stories she had ever heard, pacing back and forth on the other side of the room. She found him incredibly comical and laughed until she was exhausted. Mrs. Rucastle, however, who seemed to have no sense of humor, didn't even smile, sitting with her hands in her lap and a sad, worried expression. After about an hour, Mr. Rucastle abruptly stated it was time for the day's duties and she could change out of the dress and go to little Edward in the nursery. This exact performance was repeated two days later under the same conditions. She changed into the dress again, sat in the window, and again laughed heartily at her employer's funny stories, of which he had a vast collection and told expertly. He then gave her a yellow-covered novel, moved her chair slightly so her shadow wouldn't fall on the page, and asked her to read aloud. After reading for about ten minutes, starting in the middle of a chapter, he suddenly, mid-sentence, ordered her to stop and change her dress. Naturally, Mr. Holmes, she became extremely curious about the meaning of this strange ritual. She noticed they were always careful to position her chair so she faced away from the window, which made her desperate to see what was behind her. At first, it seemed impossible, but she soon found a way. Her hand-mirror was broken, which gave her an idea, and she hid a piece of the glass in her handkerchief. The next time, while laughing, she raised her handkerchief to her eyes and, with some effort, managed to see everything behind her. Initially, she was disappointed as she saw nothing. However, on a second look, she noticed a man standing in the Southampton Road, a short man with a beard wearing a grey suit, who appeared to be looking in her direction. The road was a major route with people usually present, but this man was leaning against the railings bordering their field and looking up intently. She lowered her handkerchief and saw Mrs. Rucastle’s eyes fixed on her with a penetrating gaze. Mrs. Rucastle said nothing but was convinced she had realized Miss Hunter used a mirror and had seen what was behind her. Mrs. Rucastle stood up immediately. “Jephro,” she said to her husband, “there is an insolent fellow out on the road staring up at Miss Hunter.” Mr. Rucastle asked if he was a friend of hers. She replied she knew no one in the area. “Dear me! How very impertinent!” he exclaimed. “Kindly turn round and motion to him to go away.” She suggested it might be better to ignore him. “No, no,” he insisted, “otherwise he would linger here constantly. Kindly turn round and wave him away like this.” She did as instructed, and at the same moment, Mrs. Rucastle pulled down the blind. That was a week ago, and since then, she had not sat by the window, worn the blue dress, or seen the man on the road. Holmes encouraged her to continue, saying her story seemed very interesting. She admitted it might seem disjointed and the incidents might not be connected. She then related another event from her very first day at the Copper Beeches. Mr. Rucastle took her to a small outbuilding near the kitchen door. Approaching it, she heard the distinct sound of a chain rattling and a large animal moving. “Look in here!” Mr. Rucastle said, showing her a gap between two planks. “Is he not a beauty?” She peered through and saw two glowing eyes and a vague shape huddled in the darkness. “Don’t be frightened,” her employer said, laughing at her startled reaction. “It’s only Carlo, my mastiff. I call him mine, but actually old Toller, my groom, is the only person who can handle him. We feed him once a day, sparingly, so he is always eager. Toller lets him loose every night, and may God help any trespasser he attacks. For your own safety, never cross that threshold at night under any circumstances; your life would be in danger.” This warning proved serious, as two nights later, around two in the morning, she happened to look out her bedroom window. It was a beautiful moonlit night, and the lawn in front was illuminated and almost as bright as day. While lost in the peaceful scene, she noticed movement under the shadow of the copper beeches. As it moved into the moonlight, she saw it was a massive dog, the size of a calf, tawny colored, with hanging jowls, a black muzzle, and prominent bones. It walked slowly across the lawn before disappearing into the shadows on the other side. Seeing this fearsome guard dog chilled her more deeply than any burglar could have done. Next, she had a very strange experience to share. As we knew, she had cut off her hair in London and packed it in a large coil at the bottom of her trunk. One evening, after the child was asleep, she was tidying her room and looking through her belongings. There was an old chest of drawers; the top two were empty and open, but the bottom one was locked. She had filled the top two drawers with her linen and was annoyed that she couldn't use the third drawer as she still had many things to put away. She thought it might just be an oversight, so she tried her keys. The very first key fit perfectly, and she opened the drawer. There was only one item inside, but she was sure we would never guess what it was: her coil of hair. She picked it up and examined it. It was the same unusual color and thickness as her own. But then the impossibility of it struck her. How could her hair have been locked in that drawer? With trembling hands, she unpacked her trunk, emptied it, and found her own hair at the bottom. She placed the two coils side by side and swore they were identical. She found it utterly extraordinary. No matter how much she puzzled over it, she couldn't understand what it meant. She put the strange hair back in the drawer and decided not to mention the discovery to the Rucastles, feeling she was in the wrong for opening a drawer they had locked. ",
          "paraphrase_gpt-4.1-2025-04-14": "The Black Swan is a well-known inn located on the High Street, not far from the railway station, and that's where we found the young woman waiting for us. She had reserved a sitting-room, and our lunch was already prepared on the table. \"I’m so happy you’ve come,\" she said sincerely. \"It’s incredibly thoughtful of you both; I truly don’t know what I would have done otherwise. Your advice will be invaluable to me.\"\n\n\"Please, tell us what’s happened to you.\"\n\n\"I will, and I must be brief, as I promised Mr. Rucastle that I’d return before three o’clock. He let me come into town this morning, though he has no idea why.\"\n\n\"Let’s hear everything in the proper order,\" Holmes said, settling himself to listen.\n\n\"First of all, I haven’t been physically mistreated by Mr. or Mrs. Rucastle—it’s only fair to say so. But there are things about them I can’t understand, and I feel uneasy.\"\n\n\"What is it that confuses you?\"\n\n\"Their behavior—the motives behind what they do. But I’ll explain everything from the beginning. When I arrived, Mr. Rucastle met me here and drove me in his carriage to the Copper Beeches. As he described, it’s beautifully situated, though the house itself isn’t attractive—a large whitewashed block, stained and weathered. There are grounds, with woods on three sides, and a field on the fourth that slopes down to the main road, which passes a hundred yards from the front door. The front field belongs to the house, but the surrounding woods are Lord Southerton’s. A cluster of copper beech trees near the door gives the house its name.\n\nMy employer drove me there, behaving as pleasantly as usual, and introduced me that evening to his wife and their son. The theory we discussed at Baker Street was incorrect—Mrs. Rucastle isn’t insane. She’s a quiet, pale woman, much younger than her husband, about thirty compared to his forty-five. From what they said, they’ve been married seven years, he’s a widower, and his only child from his first marriage—a daughter—has gone to Philadelphia. In private, he told me she left because she disliked her stepmother. Since she was at least twenty, I can imagine it was difficult with a young stepmother.\n\nMrs. Rucastle struck me as colorless in both personality and appearance—she made no strong impression either way. She seems to devote herself to her husband and young son, her grey eyes always attentive to their needs. Mr. Rucastle is kind to her in a loud, hearty way, and overall, they appear to be a happy couple. Yet there’s a deep sadness in her—she often appears lost in thought or in tears. I sometimes think it’s her child’s character that troubles her, as I’ve never known such a spoiled, mean-spirited child—small for his age, with an unusually large head, who moves between anger and sulking. He seems to enjoy hurting creatures smaller than himself and is clever at catching mice and birds. But I’d rather not dwell on him, and in any case, he’s not central to my story.\"\n\n\"Any detail could be important,\" Holmes noted, \"whether it seems relevant or not.\"\n\n\"I’ll omit nothing crucial. The one unpleasant element of the house is the servants. There are only two—a husband and wife. Toller, the man, is rough, unkempt, with graying hair and always smells of drink; he’s been quite drunk twice since I arrived, but Mr. Rucastle ignores it. His wife is very tall and strong, sour-faced, even quieter than Mrs. Rucastle, and less pleasant. They’re an unpleasant pair, but I spend most of my time in the nursery or my own room, which are together in one corner of the house.\n\nFor the first two days at Copper Beeches, my life was quiet; but on the third, after breakfast, Mrs. Rucastle whispered something to her husband.\n\n'Oh yes,' he said to me, 'we’re grateful you agreed to have your hair cut; I promise it hasn’t hurt your appearance. Now let’s see how the electric-blue dress suits you. It’s on your bed—please put it on for us.'\n\nThe dress was an odd blue, good fabric but clearly worn before—yet it fit perfectly. Mr. and Mrs. Rucastle were quite enthusiastic about it. They waited for me in the large drawing-room, which spans the front of the house and has three tall windows. A chair was placed near the middle window, back facing it, and I was asked to sit. Mr. Rucastle paced the room, entertaining me with funny stories—I laughed until I was exhausted—though Mrs. Rucastle never smiled, remaining seated with a sad, worried look. \n\nAfter about an hour, Mr. Rucastle said it was time for my usual duties, so I could change and go to Edward in the nursery.\n\nTwo days later, we repeated this performance exactly: again I changed into the dress, sat by the window, listened and laughed at Mr. Rucastle's stories. Afterwards he gave me a yellow-backed novel, moved my chair so my shadow wouldn’t fall on the page, and asked me to read aloud. After ten minutes, he suddenly ordered me to stop and change my dress.\n\nYou can imagine, Mr. Holmes, how curious this made me. They were always careful to keep my face turned away from the window, so I was eager to find out what was happening behind me. My mirror was broken, but I took a piece of the glass and hid it in my handkerchief. Next time, pretending to wipe my eyes, I used it to look behind me. At first I saw nothing, but then I noticed a small, bearded man in a grey suit standing on the Southampton Road, looking towards the house. The road is busy, but this man stood leaning against the fence, staring up. When I looked at Mrs. Rucastle, I saw she was watching me intently; though she said nothing, I’m sure she realized I’d used a mirror. She immediately got up.\n\n'Jephro,' she said, 'there’s a rude stranger on the road staring at Miss Hunter.'\n\n'Is he known to you, Miss Hunter?' he asked.\n\n'No, I don’t know anyone around here.'\n\n'Dear me! How impertinent! Please turn and signal for him to leave.'\n\n'Wouldn't it be better to ignore him?'\n\n'No, no, he'd just keep hanging around. Please turn and wave him away.'\n\nI did as asked, and at once Mrs. Rucastle pulled down the window blind. That was a week ago; I haven’t sat by that window, worn the dress, or seen the man since.\n\n\"Please continue,\" said Holmes. \"Your story is most intriguing.\"\n\n\"It may seem somewhat disjointed, and the events might not seem to connect. On my first day at Copper Beeches, Mr. Rucastle took me to a small outbuilding near the kitchen. As we approached, I heard chains rattling and the movement of a large animal. \n\n'Look in here!' Mr. Rucastle said, showing me a gap between two boards, 'Isn’t he magnificent?'\n\nI peered in and saw two glowing eyes and a vague shape in the darkness.\n\n'Don’t be alarmed,' he laughed at my reaction. 'It’s just Carlo, my mastiff. Old Toller is the only one who can manage him. We feed him once a day—not too much—so he stays hungry. Toller lets him loose every night; woe to anyone the dog catches. Never, under any circumstance, go outside after dark—it's too dangerous.'\n\nThis was no idle warning. Two nights later, I looked out my bedroom window around two a.m. It was bright moonlight, and as I gazed at the lawn, I saw something move under the copper beeches—a huge, calf-sized dog, tawny with a black muzzle and oversized bones. It crossed the lawn and disappeared. That fearsome guard frightened me more than any burglar could have.\n\nNow, I must tell you of an odd incident. I had cut my hair in London and kept the coil at the bottom of my trunk. One evening, after the child was asleep, I began tidying my things. There was an old chest of drawers in my room—the top two empty and in use, the bottom one locked. Since I had more things to store, I tried one of my keys and it opened immediately. Inside was just one thing—my coil of hair. The color and thickness were identical to mine. But when I checked my trunk, my own coil was still there. I compared them—they matched exactly. It was extraordinary, and I couldn’t explain it. I put the other coil back in the locked drawer and said nothing to the Rucastles, as I realized I shouldn’t have opened a locked drawer."

          "text_segment": "“I am naturally observant, as you may have remarked, Mr. Holmes, and I soon had a pretty good plan of the whole house in my head. There was one wing, however, which appeared not to be inhabited at all. A door which faced that which led into the quarters of the Tollers opened into this suite, but it was invariably locked. One day, however, as I ascended the stair, I met Mr. Rucastle coming out through this door, his keys in his hand, and a look on his face which made him a very different person to the round, jovial man to whom I was accustomed. His cheeks were red, his brow was all crinkled with anger, and the veins stood out at his temples with passion. He locked the door and hurried past me without a word or a look.\n“This aroused my curiosity, so when I went out for a walk in the grounds with my charge, I strolled round to the side from which I could see the windows of this part of the house. There were four of them in a row, three of which were simply dirty, while the fourth was shuttered up. They were evidently all deserted. As I strolled up and down, glancing at them occasionally, Mr. Rucastle came out to me, looking as merry and jovial as ever.\n“‘Ah!’ said he, ‘you must not think me rude if I passed you without a word, my dear young lady. I was preoccupied with business matters.’\n“I assured him that I was not offended. ‘By the way,’ said I, ‘you seem to have quite a suite of spare rooms up there, and one of them has the shutters up.’\n“He looked surprised and, as it seemed to me, a little startled at my remark.\n“‘Photography is one of my hobbies,’ said he. ‘I have made my dark room up there. But, dear me! what an observant young lady we have come upon. Who would have believed it? Who would have ever believed it?’ He spoke in a jesting tone, but there was no jest in his eyes as he looked at me. I read suspicion there and annoyance, but no jest.\n“Well, Mr. Holmes, from the moment that I understood that there was something about that suite of rooms which I was not to know, I was all on fire to go over them. It was not mere curiosity, though I have my share of that. It was more a feeling of duty—a feeling that some good might come from my penetrating to this place. They talk of woman’s instinct; perhaps it was woman’s instinct which gave me that feeling. At any rate, it was there, and I was keenly on the lookout for any chance to pass the forbidden door.\n“It was only yesterday that the chance came. I may tell you that, besides Mr. Rucastle, both Toller and his wife find something to do in these deserted rooms, and I once saw him carrying a large black linen bag with him through the door. Recently he has been drinking hard, and yesterday evening he was very drunk; and when I came upstairs there was the key in the door. I have no doubt at all that he had left it there. Mr. and Mrs. Rucastle were both downstairs, and the child was with them, so that I had an admirable opportunity. I turned the key gently in the lock, opened the door, and slipped through.\n“There was a little passage in front of me, unpapered and uncarpeted, which turned at a right angle at the farther end. Round this corner were three doors in a line, the first and third of which were open. They each led into an empty room, dusty and cheerless, with two windows in the one and one in the other, so thick with dirt that the evening light glimmered dimly through them. The centre door was closed, and across the outside of it had been fastened one of the broad bars of an iron bed, padlocked at one end to a ring in the wall, and fastened at the other with stout cord. The door itself was locked as well, and the key was not there. This barricaded door corresponded clearly with the shuttered window outside, and yet I could see by the glimmer from beneath it that the room was not in darkness. Evidently there was a skylight which let in light from above. As I stood in the passage gazing at the sinister door and wondering what secret it might veil, I suddenly heard the sound of steps within the room and saw a shadow pass backward and forward against the little slit of dim light which shone out from under the door. A mad, unreasoning terror rose up in me at the sight, Mr. Holmes. My overstrung nerves failed me suddenly, and I turned and ran—ran as though some dreadful hand were behind me clutching at the skirt of my dress. I rushed down the passage, through the door, and straight into the arms of Mr. Rucastle, who was waiting outside.\n“‘So,’ said he, smiling, ‘it was you, then. I thought that it must be when I saw the door open.’\n“‘Oh, I am so frightened!’ I panted.\n“‘My dear young lady! my dear young lady!’—you cannot think how caressing and soothing his manner was—‘and what has frightened you, my dear young lady?’\n“But his voice was just a little too coaxing. He overdid it. I was keenly on my guard against him.\n“‘I was foolish enough to go into the empty wing,’ I answered. ‘But it is so lonely and eerie in this dim light that I was frightened and ran out again. Oh, it is so dreadfully still in there!’\n“‘Only that?’ said he, looking at me keenly.\n“‘Why, what did you think?’ I asked.\n“‘Why do you think that I lock this door?’\n“‘I am sure that I do not know.’\n“‘It is to keep people out who have no business there. Do you see?’ He was still smiling in the most amiable manner.\n“‘I am sure if I had known—’\n“‘Well, then, you know now. And if you ever put your foot over that threshold again’—here in an instant the smile hardened into a grin of rage, and he glared down at me with the face of a demon—‘I’ll throw you to the mastiff.’\n“I was so terrified that I do not know what I did. I suppose that I must have rushed past him into my room. I remember nothing until I found myself lying on my bed trembling all over. Then I thought of you, Mr. Holmes. I could not live there longer without some advice. I was frightened of the house, of the man, of the woman, of the servants, even of the child. They were all horrible to me. If I could only bring you down all would be well. Of course I might have fled from the house, but my curiosity was almost as strong as my fears. My mind was soon made up. I would send you a wire. I put on my hat and cloak, went down to the office, which is about half a mile from the house, and then returned, feeling very much easier. A horrible doubt came into my mind as I approached the door lest the dog might be loose, but I remembered that Toller had drunk himself into a state of insensibility that evening, and I knew that he was the only one in the household who had any influence with the savage creature, or who would venture to set him free. I slipped in in safety and lay awake half the night in my joy at the thought of seeing you. I had no difficulty in getting leave to come into Winchester this morning, but I must be back before three o’clock, for Mr. and Mrs. Rucastle are going on a visit, and will be away all the evening, so that I must look after the child. Now I have told you all my adventures, Mr. Holmes, and I should be very glad if you could tell me what it all means, and, above all, what I should do.”",
          "paraphrase_gemini-2.5-flash-preview-04-17": "As you might have noticed, Mr. Holmes, I am naturally observant, and I quickly formed a clear mental picture of the entire house layout. However, there was one section that seemed completely uninhabited. A door opposite the one leading to the Tollers' rooms opened into this suite, but it was always locked. One day, while going upstairs, I encountered Mr. Rucastle emerging from this door, holding his keys. His expression was completely unlike his usual friendly, cheerful demeanor. His face was flushed with anger, his brow furrowed deeply, and the veins in his temples bulged with intense emotion. He locked the door and hurried past me without speaking or even looking. This incident sparked my curiosity, so later, during a walk in the grounds with my young charge, I went to the side of the house where I could see the windows of this wing. There were four windows in a row; three were merely dusty, while the fourth was boarded up. They clearly belonged to unoccupied rooms. While I was pacing back and forth, occasionally glancing at the windows, Mr. Rucastle came out to meet me, looking as happy and pleasant as usual. 'Ah!' he said, 'please don't think I was rude passing you without a word earlier, my dear young lady. I was distracted by business.' I assured him I wasn't offended. 'Speaking of which,' I remarked, 'you seem to have several empty rooms up there, and one window is shuttered.' He appeared taken aback and, it seemed to me, slightly unsettled by my comment. 'One of my hobbies is photography,' he explained. 'I've set up my darkroom in there. But, my goodness! What an exceptionally sharp-eyed young lady you are. Who would have thought it? Who could possibly have thought it?' He spoke in a playful tone, but his eyes held no amusement as he looked at me. I detected suspicion and irritation in his gaze, not jest. Well, Mr. Holmes, from the moment I realized there was something about that suite of rooms that was being kept secret from me, I became desperately eager to explore them. It wasn't just simple curiosity, although I do have my share of that. It felt more like a sense of duty—a conviction that investigating this place might lead to some positive outcome. People talk about female intuition; perhaps it was that which gave me this feeling. Whatever it was, it was strong, and I was constantly searching for an opportunity to pass through that forbidden door. The chance finally arose just yesterday. I should mention that besides Mr. Rucastle, both Toller and his wife seem to have some involvement with these empty rooms, and I once saw him carrying a large black canvas bag through the door. Recently, he's been drinking heavily, and last night he was very drunk. When I went upstairs, I found the key left in the door. I'm certain he must have forgotten it there. Mr. and Mrs. Rucastle were both downstairs with the child, so it was the perfect moment. I gently turned the key, opened the door, and slipped inside. Ahead of me was a short passage, with bare walls and no carpet, turning sharply at the far end. Around the corner were three doors in a line. The first and third were open, each leading into an empty, dusty, and cheerless room. One had two windows and the other one, but they were so dirty that only a faint glimmer of the evening light filtered through. The middle door was closed, and across its exterior, a heavy iron bed frame bar had been fastened, padlocked at one end to a wall ring and secured at the other with thick rope. The door itself was also locked, and the key was missing. This barricaded door clearly corresponded to the shuttered window visible from outside, yet I could see a faint light shining from beneath it, indicating the room wasn't completely dark. There must have been a skylight providing light from above. As I stood in the passage staring at the ominous door, wondering what secret it concealed, I suddenly heard footsteps inside the room and saw a shadow moving back and forth against the narrow band of dim light from under the door. A wave of wild, irrational terror washed over me at that sight, Mr. Holmes. My already frayed nerves gave way entirely, and I turned and ran—fleeing as if a terrifying hand were reaching for my dress from behind. I raced down the passage, out the door, and directly into the waiting arms of Mr. Rucastle. 'So,' he said, smiling, 'it was you after all. I suspected as much when I saw the door open.' 'Oh, I'm so scared!' I gasped, panting. 'My dear young lady! My dear young lady!'—you wouldn't believe how gentle and comforting his tone was—'And what could have frightened you so, my dear young lady?' But his voice felt a little too sweet, too contrived. He overdid it. I remained highly wary of him. 'I was foolish enough to venture into the empty wing,' I replied. 'But it's so desolate and spooky in the dim light that I got scared and ran straight out. Oh, it's dreadfully silent in there!' 'Is that all?' he asked, looking at me intently. 'Well, what else did you imagine?' I countered. 'Why do you suppose I keep this door locked?' 'I really have no idea.' 'It is to keep out people who have no business there. Understand?' He was still smiling in the most pleasant way. 'I assure you, if I had known—' 'Well, now you do know. And if you ever dare to set foot over that threshold again'—at this point, his smile instantly contorted into a furious snarl, and he glared down at me with a face like a demon—'I will throw you to the mastiff.' I was so petrified I barely remember what I did. I suppose I must have rushed past him into my room. My first clear memory is finding myself lying on my bed, trembling uncontrollably. Then I thought of you, Mr. Holmes. I couldn't remain there any longer without seeking your advice. I was terrified of the house, the man, the woman, the servants, even the child. They all seemed sinister to me. If only I could bring you here, everything would be alright. Of course, I could have just run away, but my curiosity was almost as powerful as my fear. I quickly made up my mind. I would send you a telegram. I put on my hat and coat, went to the post office about half a mile from the house, sent the wire, and then returned feeling much more at ease. A terrible thought crossed my mind as I approached the door – that the dog might be loose. But I remembered that Toller had drunk himself into unconsciousness that evening, and I knew he was the only one in the household who had any control over the savage beast or would dare to let it out. I slipped in safely and lay awake for much of the night, filled with joy at the prospect of seeing you. I had no trouble getting permission to come to Winchester this morning, but I must be back by three o'clock because Mr. and Mrs. Rucastle are going out and will be away all evening, so I need to look after the child. Now I have recounted all my experiences, Mr. Holmes, and I would be most grateful if you could explain what it all signifies, and, most importantly, tell me what I should do.",
          "paraphrase_gpt-4.1-2025-04-14": "As you may have noticed, Mr. Holmes, I’m quite observant by nature and was soon able to form a mental map of the entire house. Yet there was one wing that seemed completely unoccupied. A door opposite the one leading to the Tollers’ rooms opened into this area, but it was always locked. However, one day as I was going upstairs, I saw Mr. Rucastle coming out of that door with his keys in hand, looking nothing like his usual cheerful self—his face was red, his brow furrowed with anger, and the veins on his temples were bulging. He locked the door and walked past me silently, without so much as a look.\n\nThis event piqued my curiosity. Later, while walking outside with my charge, I managed to get a view of that part of the house. It had four windows in a row; three were merely dusty, but the fourth was shuttered. The whole area appeared abandoned. As I paced back and forth glancing at the windows, Mr. Rucastle came out to join me, once again appearing as happy and friendly as ever.\n\nHe apologized for passing me earlier without a word, claiming he was distracted by business. I told him I wasn’t offended and commented about the unused rooms and the one with shutters. He seemed surprised—maybe even a bit startled—and explained that he used that room as a darkroom for his photography, teasing me about my sharp powers of observation. While he joked, I could see suspicion and annoyance in his eyes.\n\nFrom that point, I was determined to investigate the locked suite. It wasn’t just curiosity; I felt a sense of duty, perhaps led by instinct, believing something good could come from me discovering what was hidden there. So I looked for any opportunity to access those rooms.\n\nJust yesterday, such an opportunity presented itself. Aside from Mr. Rucastle, Toller and his wife also go into those rooms sometimes, and I once saw Toller carrying a large black bag through the door. Recently, Toller has been drinking heavily; yesterday, he was very drunk and left the key in the door when I came upstairs. With everyone else downstairs—including the child—I took the chance, gently unlocked the door, and slipped inside.\n\nAhead was an undecorated passage that turned sharply at the end. Around the corner were three doors in a row; the first and third were open, leading to empty, dusty, cheerless rooms with grimy windows. The middle door, though, was firmly secured with a metal bed bar padlocked at one end, tied at the other, and locked itself, with no key in sight. This obviously matched the shuttered window I’d seen outside, but dim light showed me the room wasn’t completely dark—there must be a skylight.\n\nAs I stood considering the locked door and its secret, I suddenly heard footsteps and saw a shadow moving against the sliver of light beneath the door. Terror overwhelmed me, and I fled back down the passage, through the entry, right into Mr. Rucastle waiting outside.\n\nHe smiled and said he suspected it had been me when he saw the door open. Gasping, I told him I was frightened. He spoke to me soothingly, almost too soothingly, and asked what had scared me. On guard, I replied that I’d gone into the empty wing but felt spooked by its emptiness and had run out. He questioned whether that was all, and then asked if I knew why the door was locked. I said I didn’t, and he told me it was to keep out those who didn’t belong there. Then his demeanor changed suddenly, and he threatened that if I crossed that threshold again, he’d set his mastiff on me.\n\nI was so terrified that I don’t recall what happened next—likely I rushed to my room, trembling. Lying on my bed, I realized I couldn’t remain in that house without advice, as I was afraid of everyone and everything there. The only way I could feel safe was by contacting you, Mr. Holmes. Though I could have run away, my curiosity was nearly as powerful as my fear, so I decided to send you a telegram. I walked to the office, sent it, and returned, relieved. A brief fear about the dog crossed my mind, but I remembered that Toller was too drunk to release it. I got home safely, though I didn’t sleep well, still anxious but comforted by my plan to see you.\n\nThis morning, I easily got leave to come to Winchester, but I must return by three o’clock as Mr. and Mrs. Rucastle are going out and I’m needed to look after the child. That’s everything that’s happened, Mr. Holmes, and I’d be grateful if you could explain it all and advise me on what to do next."

          "text_segment": "Holmes and I had listened spellbound to this extraordinary story. My friend rose now and paced up and down the room, his hands in his pockets, and an expression of the most profound gravity upon his face.\n“Is Toller still drunk?” he asked.\n“Yes. I heard his wife tell Mrs. Rucastle that she could do nothing with him.”\n“That is well. And the Rucastles go out to-night?”\n“Yes.”\n“Is there a cellar with a good strong lock?”\n“Yes, the wine-cellar.”\n“You seem to me to have acted all through this matter like a very brave and sensible girl, Miss Hunter. Do you think that you could perform one more feat? I should not ask it of you if I did not think you a quite exceptional woman.”\n“I will try. What is it?”\n“We shall be at the Copper Beeches by seven o’clock, my friend and I. The Rucastles will be gone by that time, and Toller will, we hope, be incapable. There only remains Mrs. Toller, who might give the alarm. If you could send her into the cellar on some errand, and then turn the key upon her, you would facilitate matters immensely.”\n“I will do it.”\n“Excellent! We shall then look thoroughly into the affair. Of course there is only one feasible explanation. You have been brought there to personate someone, and the real person is imprisoned in this chamber. That is obvious. As to who this prisoner is, I have no doubt that it is the daughter, Miss Alice Rucastle, if I remember right, who was said to have gone to America. You were chosen, doubtless, as resembling her in height, figure, and the colour of your hair. Hers had been cut off, very possibly in some illness through which she has passed, and so, of course, yours had to be sacrificed also. By a curious chance you came upon her tresses. The man in the road was undoubtedly some friend of hers—possibly her fiancé—and no doubt, as you wore the girl’s dress and were so like her, he was convinced from your laughter, whenever he saw you, and afterwards from your gesture, that Miss Rucastle was perfectly happy, and that she no longer desired his attentions. The dog is let loose at night to prevent him from endeavouring to communicate with her. So much is fairly clear. The most serious point in the case is the disposition of the child.”\n“What on earth has that to do with it?” I ejaculated.\n“My dear Watson, you as a medical man are continually gaining light as to the tendencies of a child by the study of the parents. Don’t you see that the converse is equally valid. I have frequently gained my first real insight into the character of parents by studying their children. This child’s disposition is abnormally cruel, merely for cruelty’s sake, and whether he derives this from his smiling father, as I should suspect, or from his mother, it bodes evil for the poor girl who is in their power.”\n“I am sure that you are right, Mr. Holmes,” cried our client. “A thousand things come back to me which make me certain that you have hit it. Oh, let us lose not an instant in bringing help to this poor creature.”\n“We must be circumspect, for we are dealing with a very cunning man. We can do nothing until seven o’clock. At that hour we shall be with you, and it will not be long before we solve the mystery.”",
          "paraphrase_gemini-2.5-flash-preview-04-17": "Holmes and I were completely engrossed by this remarkable account. My friend then stood up and walked back and forth across the room, with his hands pocketed and a very serious look on his face. He inquired, \"Is Toller still intoxicated?\" \"Yes,\" she replied. \"I heard his wife mention to Mrs. Rucastle that she was unable to control him.\" \"That's good,\" he commented. \"And the Rucastles will be going out this evening?\" \"They are.\" \"Is there a basement area secured by a sturdy lock?\" \"Yes, the cellar where the wine is kept.\" \"Miss Hunter, it appears to me that you have behaved with great courage and sound judgment throughout this entire situation. Do you believe you could manage one final task? I would not ask this of you if I didn't consider you a truly extraordinary person.\" \"I will attempt it. What do you need?\" \"My friend and I plan to arrive at the Copper Beeches by seven o'clock. By then, the Rucastles will have departed, and Toller will hopefully be unable to intervene. Only Mrs. Toller will remain, and she could potentially raise an alert. If you could persuade her to go into the cellar for some purpose and then lock her inside, it would greatly simplify things.\" \"I can do that.\" \"Splendid! We will then investigate the matter in depth. Naturally, there is only one plausible explanation for all this. You have been brought here to pretend to be someone else, and the actual person is being held captive in this room. That much is clear. Regarding the identity of this captive, I am quite certain it is the daughter, Miss Alice Rucastle—if my memory serves me correctly—who was reportedly sent to America. You were undoubtedly selected because you resemble her in terms of height, build, and hair color. Her hair had been cut off, likely due to an illness she suffered, and therefore, naturally, your hair had to be cut as well. Through a strange coincidence, you discovered her severed hair. The individual you encountered on the road was certainly one of her acquaintances—perhaps her fiancé—and unquestionably, because you were wearing the young woman's clothing and resembled her so closely, your laughter and later your gesture led him to believe that Miss Rucastle was completely content and no longer wished for his company. The dog is released at night to prevent him from attempting to contact her. This much seems reasonably evident. The most concerning aspect of this situation is the child's nature.\" \"What does that possibly have to do with anything?\" I exclaimed. \"My dear Watson, as a physician, you constantly learn about a child's characteristics by observing their parents. Don't you realize that the opposite is also true? I have often gained my initial significant understanding of parents' characters by examining their children. This child exhibits an unusual degree of cruelty, simply for the sake of being cruel, and whether this trait comes from his seemingly pleasant father, as I suspect, or from his mother, it foretells trouble for the unfortunate young woman who is under their control.\" \"Mr. Holmes, I am certain you are correct,\" our client stated emotionally. \"Countless details are now coming back to me, making me positive that you have accurately deduced the situation. Oh, we must not waste a moment in providing assistance to this distressed person.\" \"We must proceed with caution, as we are dealing with a highly clever individual. We cannot take any action until seven o'clock. At that specific time, we will join you, and the mystery will not remain unsolved for long.\"",

By then the Rucastles should have left, and Toller will hopefully still be incapacitated. The only one left who might raise the alarm is Mrs. Toller. If you could find a reason to send her to the cellar and lock her in, it would help us greatly.”\n“I will do it.”\n“Excellent! Then we can fully investigate. There is only one plausible explanation.

Her own hair was likely cut off due to illness, so yours had to be cut as well. By chance, you stumbled upon her hair.

The dog is let out at night to stop him from trying to communicate with her. That much is clear. The biggest concern is the child’s temperament.”\n\n“What does that have to do with it?” I asked.\n\n“My dear Watson, you, as a doctor, learn about children's tendencies by studying their parents. But the reverse is also true—I often understand parents better by observing their children.

Please, let’s hurry and help her.”\n\n“We need to be careful, since we’re dealing with a clever man. We can’t do anything until seven.

The group of trees, with their dark leaves shining like burnished metal in the light of the setting sun, were sufficient to mark the house even had Miss Hunter not been standing smiling on the door-step.\n“Have you managed it?” asked Holmes.\nA loud thudding noise came from somewhere downstairs. “That is Mrs. Toller in the cellar,” said she. “Her husband lies snoring on the kitchen rug. Here are his keys, which are the duplicates of Mr. Rucastle’s.”\n“You have done well indeed!” cried Holmes with enthusiasm. “Now lead the way, and we shall soon see the end of this black business.”\nWe passed up the stair, unlocked the door, followed on down a passage, and found ourselves in front of the barricade which Miss Hunter had described.

Now, Watson, put your shoulder to it, and we shall see whether we cannot make our way in.”\nIt was an old rickety door and gave at once before our united strength. Together we rushed into the room. It was empty. There was no furniture save a little pallet bed, a small table, and a basketful of linen. The skylight above was open, and the prisoner gone.\n“There has been some villainy here,” said Holmes; “this beauty has guessed Miss Hunter’s intentions and has carried his victim off.”\n“But how?”\n“Through the skylight. We shall soon see how he managed it.” He swung himself up onto the roof. “Ah, yes,” he cried, “here’s the end of a long light ladder against the eaves. That is how he did it.”\n“But it is impossible,” said Miss Hunter; “the ladder was not there when the Rucastles went away.”\n“He has come back and done it.

Holmes cut the rope and removed the horizontal bar. He then tried the various keys in the lock, but none worked.

Now, Watson, lend your weight, and we will see if we can force our way in.”\n\nThe door was old and flimsy, yielding immediately to our combined force. We burst into the room together. It was empty.

After sending the now-sobered Toller to inform his wife, I did what I could to ease Rucastle’s pain."

Ah, miss, it is a pity you didn’t let me know what you were planning, for I would have told you that your pains were wasted.”\n“Ha!” said Holmes, looking keenly at her. “It is clear that Mrs. Toller knows more about this matter than anyone else.”\n“Yes, sir, I do, and I am ready enough to tell what I know.”\n“Then, pray, sit down, and let us hear it for there are several points on which I must confess that I am still in the dark.”\n“I will soon make it clear to you,” said she; “and I’d have done so before now if I could ha’ got out from the cellar. If there’s police-court business over this, you’ll remember that I was the one that stood your friend, and that I was Miss Alice’s friend too.\n“She was never happy at home, Miss Alice wasn’t, from the time that her father married again. She was slighted like and had no say in anything, but it never really became bad for her until after she met Mr. Fowler at a friend’s house. As well as I could learn, Miss Alice had rights of her own by will, but she was so quiet and patient, she was, that she never said a word about them but just left everything in Mr. Rucastle’s hands. He knew he was safe with her; but when there was a chance of a husband coming forward, who would ask for all that the law would give him, then her father thought it time to put a stop on it. He wanted her to sign a paper, so that whether she married or not, he could use her money. When she wouldn’t do it, he kept on worrying her until she got brain-fever, and for six weeks was at death’s door. Then she got better at last, all worn to a shadow, and with her beautiful hair cut off; but that didn’t make no change in her young man, and he stuck to her as true as man could be.”\n“Ah,” said Holmes, “I think that what you have been good enough to tell us makes the matter fairly clear, and that I can deduce all that remains. Mr. Rucastle then, I presume, took to this system of imprisonment?”\n“Yes, sir.”\n“And brought Miss Hunter down from London in order to get rid of the disagreeable persistence of Mr. Fowler.”\n“That was it, sir.”\n“But Mr. Fowler being a persevering man, as a good seaman should be, blockaded the house, and having met you succeeded by certain arguments, metallic or otherwise, in convincing you that your interests were the same as his.”\n“Mr. Fowler was a very kind-spoken, free-handed gentleman,” said Mrs. Toller serenely.\n“And in this way he managed that your good man should have no want of drink, and that a ladder should be ready at the moment when your master had gone out.”\n“You have it, sir, just as it happened.”\n“I am sure we owe you an apology, Mrs. Toller,” said Holmes, “for you have certainly cleared up everything which puzzled us. And here comes the country surgeon and Mrs. Rucastle, so I think, Watson, that we had best escort Miss Hunter back to Winchester, as it seems to me that our locus standi now is rather a questionable one.”\nAnd thus was solved the mystery of the sinister house with the copper beeches in front of the door. Mr. Rucastle survived, but was always a broken man, kept alive solely through the care of his devoted wife. They still live with their old servants, who probably know so much of Rucastle’s past life that he finds it difficult to part from them.

          "paraphrase_gpt-4.1-2025-04-14": "We had all gathered around him when a tall, thin woman came into the room. \n“Mrs. Toller!” exclaimed Miss Hunter.\n“Yes, miss. Mr. Rucastle let me out when he returned, before going up to see you. If only I had known what you were planning, I would have told you your efforts were in vain.”\nHolmes, observing her closely, said, “It’s clear Mrs. Toller knows more about this than anyone.”\n“Yes, sir, I do, and I’m quite willing to share what I know.”\n“Please, sit down and tell us, for there are still several things I don’t understand.”\n“I’ll explain everything,” Mrs. Toller replied. “And I would have done it earlier if I hadn’t been locked in the cellar. If this becomes a police matter, remember that I was always on your side and also Miss Alice’s friend. \n“Miss Alice was never happy at home after her father’s second marriage. She was neglected and had no say in anything. Things truly worsened for her after she met Mr. Fowler. As far as I know, Miss Alice had her own inheritance by will, but she was so gentle and patient that she never mentioned it and let Mr. Rucastle manage it all. He felt secure as long as she was quiet, but when it seemed she might marry and her husband could claim her rights, her father decided to stop it. He tried to make her sign a paper so that, married or not, he could control her money. When she refused, he pestered her until she fell seriously ill for six weeks. Even as she recovered, weak and with her hair cut off, her suitor remained devoted to her.”\n“Now it’s mostly clear,” said Holmes, “and I can guess the rest. Mr. Rucastle began imprisoning her?”\n“Yes, sir.”\n“And brought Miss Hunter from London to distract from Mr. Fowler’s determined efforts?”\n“That’s it, sir.”\n“But Mr. Fowler, persistent as a seaman should be, surrounded the house and persuaded you—by whatever means—that your interests matched his?”\n“Mr. Fowler was very kind and generous,” Mrs. Toller replied calmly.\n“And so, with your help, your husband had plenty to drink and a ladder was prepared for the right moment?”\n“That’s exactly what happened.”\n“We owe you an apology, Mrs. Toller,” said Holmes, “for you have explained all our confusion. Now the country doctor and Mrs. Rucastle are arriving, so Watson, we’d best take Miss Hunter back to Winchester, as I think we really shouldn’t stay here any longer.”\nThus the mystery of the strange house with copper beeches was resolved. Mr. Rucastle survived but became a broken man, cared for solely by his loyal wife. The couple still live with their old servants, who likely know too much about Mr. Rucastle for him to dismiss them. Mr. Fowler and Miss Rucastle married in Southampton the day after they fled, and he now holds a government post in Mauritius. As for Miss Violet Hunter, Holmes, perhaps disappointingly, lost interest in her after the case was closed, and she now leads a private school in Walsall, where she seems to be quite successful."
