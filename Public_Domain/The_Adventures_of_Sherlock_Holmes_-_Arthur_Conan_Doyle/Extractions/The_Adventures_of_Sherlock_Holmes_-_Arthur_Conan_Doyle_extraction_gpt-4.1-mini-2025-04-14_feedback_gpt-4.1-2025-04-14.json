You would certainly have been burned, had you lived a few centuries ago.

Obviously they have been caused by someone who has very carelessly scraped round the edges of the sole in order to remove crusted mud from it. Hence, you see, my double deduction that you had been out in vile weather, and that you had a particularly malignant boot-slitting specimen of the London slavey.

It seldom was; but he was a man of great energy and determination, and his eyes had a keen, penetrating look that seemed to take in everything at a glance. I had known him for some years, and I had learned to trust his judgment implicitly. On this particular occasion, he was engaged in one of those cases which, though they might seem trivial to the untrained eye, were in reality fraught with danger and complexity.\n\nThe case began with a visit from a distressed young woman, whose delicate features were marred by the pallor of anxiety. She spoke in a low voice, recounting a series of strange occurrences that had disturbed her peace of mind. Her story was one of mystery and intrigue, involving a missing heirloom, a secret rendezvous, and a shadowy figure who seemed to haunt the corridors of her ancestral home.\n\nSherlock Holmes listened attentively, his fingers steepled beneath his chin, his eyes never leaving hers. When she had finished, he asked a few pointed questions, each one designed to elicit the smallest detail that might prove crucial. It was in these moments that his genius shone brightest, for he had the rare ability to sift through the chaff and find the kernel of truth hidden within.\n\nWe set out for the woman's estate at once, the evening air crisp and tinged with the scent of impending rain. The house was an imposing structure, its stone walls weathered by time but still standing resolute against the elements. Inside, the atmosphere was heavy with the weight of unspoken secrets and long-forgotten grievances.\n\nHolmes moved through the rooms with the grace of a cat, his keen eyes noting every detail—the placement of a chair, the smudge on a windowpane, the faintest trace of a scent that lingered in the air. It was in the library that he paused, his gaze fixed upon a particular bookcase. With a deft movement, he pressed a hidden latch, and the shelf swung open to reveal a concealed compartment.\n\nWithin lay the missing heirloom, a delicate locket encrusted with precious stones, its surface etched with intricate designs. The young woman gasped, tears of relief welling in her eyes. Holmes smiled faintly, his work done for the day, yet already his mind was racing ahead to the next challenge that awaited him in the shadows of London."

The ‘G’ with the small ‘t’ stands for ‘Gesellschaft,’ which is the German for ‘Company.’ It is a customary contraction like our ‘Co.’ ‘P,’ of course, stands for ‘Papier.’ Now for the ‘Eg.’ Let us glance at our Continental Gazetteer.” He took down a heavy brown volume from his shelves. “Eglow, Eglonitz—here we are, Egria.

Do you note the peculiar construction of the sentence—‘This account of you we have from all quarters received.’ A Frenchman or Russian could not have written that. It is the German who is so uncourteous to his verbs.

The paper was of a peculiar texture, not common in the city, and the scent of lavender faintly lingered upon it. This detail was not lost on me, for it suggested a connection to a certain individual known for her fondness of such fragrances.\n\nHolmes, ever observant, leaned over my shoulder and pointed out the slight indentation beneath the writing, indicating that the note had been pressed firmly, perhaps in haste or anxiety. \"Observe, Watson,\" he said, \"the pressure of the pen reveals the writer's emotional state. There is urgency here, but also a controlled hand.\"\n\nWe deduced that the note was a message from a woman, likely in distress, seeking assistance without attracting undue attention. The choice of words, the careful phrasing, all pointed to someone educated and cautious. Holmes's eyes gleamed with excitement as he pieced together the clues. \"This is no ordinary correspondence,\" he declared. \"It is a cry for help, cleverly disguised.\"\n\nOur investigation led us to a modest residence on the outskirts of London, where the scent of lavender was unmistakable. There, we found a young lady, pale and trembling, who confessed to being held captive by a nefarious relative intent on seizing her inheritance. The note was her only means of reaching out to the outside world.\n\nThanks to the keen observation and deductive reasoning of my friend, the mystery was unraveled, and justice was served.

          "text_segment": "A slow and heavy step, which had been heard upon the stairs and in the passage, paused immediately outside the door. Then there was a loud and authoritative tap.\n“Come in!” said Holmes.\nA man entered who could hardly have been less than six feet six inches in height, with the chest and limbs of a Hercules. His dress was rich with a richness which would, in England, be looked upon as akin to bad taste. Heavy bands of astrakhan were slashed across the sleeves and fronts of his double-breasted coat, while the deep blue cloak which was thrown over his shoulders was lined with flame-coloured silk and secured at the neck with a brooch which consisted of a single flaming beryl. Boots which extended halfway up his calves, and which were trimmed at the tops with rich brown fur, completed the impression of barbaric opulence which was suggested by his whole appearance. He carried a broad-brimmed hat in his hand, while he wore across the upper part of his face, extending down past the cheekbones, a black vizard mask, which he had apparently adjusted that very moment, for his hand was still raised to it as he entered. From the lower part of the face he appeared to be a man of strong character, with a thick, hanging lip, and a long, straight chin suggestive of resolution pushed to the length of obstinacy.\n“You had my note?” he asked with a deep harsh voice and a strongly marked German accent. “I told you that I would call.” He looked from one to the other of us, as if uncertain which to address.\n“Pray take a seat,” said Holmes. “This is my friend and colleague, Dr. Watson, who is occasionally good enough to help me in my cases. Whom have I the honour to address?”\n“You may address me as the Count Von Kramm, a Bohemian nobleman. I understand that this gentleman, your friend, is a man of honour and discretion, whom I may trust with a matter of the most extreme importance. If not, I should much prefer to communicate with you alone.”\nI rose to go, but Holmes caught me by the wrist and pushed me back into my chair. “It is both, or none,” said he. “You may say before this gentleman anything which you may say to me.”\nThe Count shrugged his broad shoulders. “Then I must begin,” said he, “by binding you both to absolute secrecy for two years; at the end of that time the matter will be of no importance. At present it is not too much to say that it is of such weight it may have an influence upon European history.”\n“I promise,” said Holmes.\n“And I.”\n“You will excuse this mask,” continued our strange visitor. “The august person who employs me wishes his agent to be unknown to you, and I may confess at once that the title by which I have just called myself is not exactly my own.”\n“I was aware of it,” said Holmes dryly.\n“The circumstances are of great delicacy, and every precaution has to be taken to quench what might grow to be an immense scandal and seriously compromise one of the reigning families of Europe. To speak plainly, the matter implicates the great House of Ormstein, hereditary kings of Bohemia.”\n“I was also aware of that,” murmured Holmes, settling himself down in his armchair and closing his eyes.",

The silence that followed was so profound that it seemed to press upon the very walls of the room. Then, with a faint creak, the door was pushed open, and a tall, gaunt figure entered, his face pale and drawn, eyes gleaming with a strange intensity. It was none other than Sherlock Holmes himself, returned from his latest adventure, his keen mind already racing through the details of the case that had occupied him.\n\nHolmes moved swiftly to the window, drawing aside the heavy curtains to let in the pale morning light. The city lay sprawled beneath him, a labyrinth of streets and alleys, each holding secrets and stories waiting to be uncovered. He turned then to Dr. Watson, who sat by the fire, his expression a mixture of relief and curiosity.\n\n\"Watson,\" Holmes began, his voice low and steady, \"the game is afoot once more. The case of the missing heirloom has taken a most unexpected turn.\"\n\nWatson leaned forward eagerly, his medical mind eager to assist in the unraveling of the mystery. \"Pray, tell me, Holmes, what new developments have you uncovered?\"\n\nHolmes smiled faintly, a glint of satisfaction in his eyes. \"It appears that the theft was not the work of a common thief, but rather a carefully orchestrated plot involving several parties, each with their own motives and secrets.\"\n\nHe paced the room, his fingers steepled beneath his chin as he recounted the events. \"The heirloom, a priceless ruby necklace, vanished from the estate of Lady Brackenstall during a grand ball. Initial suspicions fell upon the household staff, but my investigations have revealed a more complex web.\"\n\n\"Indeed,\" Holmes continued, \"the key lies in the movements of the guests that evening. I have identified three individuals whose actions were most peculiar: Lord Blackwood, a man with a tarnished reputation; Miss Evelyn Hart, whose fascination with jewels is well known; and Mr. Jameson, the estate's solicitor, whose financial troubles are no secret.\"\n\nWatson nodded thoughtfully. \"And what of the evidence?\"\n\nHolmes produced a small, folded piece of paper from his coat pocket. \"This,\" he said, \"was found in the garden, near the spot where the necklace was last seen. It contains a cipher, a message that I have been decoding.\"\n\nHe spread the paper on the table, revealing a series of strange symbols and numbers. \"The cipher speaks of a meeting at midnight, in the old chapel on the outskirts of the city. It is a rendezvous point for those involved in the theft.\"\n\n\"Then we must go there,\" Watson declared, rising to his feet.\n\nHolmes nodded. \"Precisely. We shall attend this meeting, and uncover the truth behind the disappearance of the heirloom.\"\n\nAs they prepared to leave, a sudden knock at the door startled them. A young woman entered, her eyes wide with fear. \"Mr. Holmes,\" she whispered, \"I have information that may aid your investigation.\"\n\nHolmes gestured for her to sit. \"Speak freely, my dear.\"\n\nShe took a deep breath. \"I overheard a conversation between Lord Blackwood and Mr. Jameson. They spoke of a plan to frame Miss Hart for the theft, to divert suspicion from themselves.\"\n\nHolmes's eyes narrowed. \"A cunning scheme. But it shall not succeed.\"\n\nThe trio set out into the fog-laden streets, their footsteps echoing in the silence. The old chapel loomed ahead, its broken windows and crumbling walls a testament to forgotten times. They approached cautiously, the air thick with anticipation.\n\nInside, shadows danced as figures gathered around a flickering candle. Holmes stepped forward, his voice ringing out. \"Gentlemen, your game is over.\"\n\nA tense silence followed, broken only by the clinking of chains as the culprits were apprehended. The heirloom was recovered, its brilliance restored to Lady Brackenstall.\n\nBack at Baker Street, Holmes and Watson reflected on the case. \"Once again, the truth has prevailed,\" Holmes mused. \"And justice has been served.\"\n\nWatson smiled. \"Thanks to your unparalleled intellect, Holmes.\"\n\nHolmes chuckled softly. \"Elementary, my dear Watson. Elementary.\""

Yet, the events that unfolded in that dark chamber changed everything. It was on a cold, foggy night that I first encountered the mystery that would haunt me forever. The flickering gaslight cast eerie shadows upon the walls, and the silence was broken only by the distant tolling of the clock. I remember the moment distinctly, for it was then that I realized the depths of human depravity and the fragile nature of sanity.\n\nThe case began with a simple inquiry—a missing heirloom, a whispered secret, a plea for help. But as I delved deeper, the threads of the mystery tangled into a web of deceit and danger. Each clue uncovered led to more questions, each revelation more unsettling than the last. The faces I met were masks hiding darker truths, and the truth itself seemed to slip through my fingers like smoke.\n\nIn those days, I sought the counsel of my dear friend, Sherlock Holmes, whose keen intellect and unwavering resolve were a beacon in the murky darkness. Together, we pieced together the puzzle, following the trail of evidence through the labyrinthine streets of London. The chase was relentless, the stakes high, and the outcome uncertain.\n\nThrough it all, I learned that madness and reason are but two sides of the same coin, and that the line between them is perilously thin. The experience left an indelible mark upon my soul, a reminder of the fragile balance that holds our world together. And though I emerged from the ordeal changed, I was grateful for the clarity it brought, and for the steadfast friendship that guided me through the shadows.”"

Besides, the case we are about to embark upon demands our immediate attention.”\n\nWe had just received a peculiar letter from a distressed noblewoman, Lady Margaret, whose priceless heirloom had vanished under the most baffling circumstances.

Specifically, there are added lines spoken by both characters and extra commentary about recognition that do not exist in the source material.\n\n2. MISSING ELEMENTS:\n- The completion omits the original's description of the narrator's difficulty in recognizing the disguised individual, including the specific detail about needing to look multiple times for certainty.\n- The time spent in the bedroom is not specified in the completion, missing the original's mention of a particular duration.\n- The completion does not include the detail about the character's transformation into a more respectable appearance, as described in the original.\n- The description of the character's laughter, including the physical reaction and the need to recline in the chair, is only partially captured and lacks some of the original's sequence and detail.\n\n3. INACCURATE ELEMENTS:\n- The sequence of events is altered: the recognition and dialogue occur before the character leaves for the bedroom, whereas in the original, recognition is confirmed before the transformation, and there is no dialogue at that point.\n- The completion attributes speech and actions to the narrator and the disguised character that are not present in the original, such as direct address and exclamations.\n- The timing of the character's reappearance is described inaccurately, with \"in a moment\" instead of the original's more specific time frame.\n- The question at the end is rephrased and does not match the type of inquiry present in the original passage."

He was a remarkably handsome man, dark, aquiline, and moustached—evidently the man of whom I had heard. He appeared to be in a great hurry, shouted to the cabman to wait, and brushed past the maid who opened the door with the air of a man who was thoroughly at home.\n“He was in the house about half an hour, and I could catch glimpses of him in the windows of the sitting-room, pacing up and down, talking excitedly, and waving his arms. Of her I could see nothing. Presently he emerged, looking even more flurried than before. As he stepped up to the cab, he pulled a gold watch from his pocket and looked at it earnestly, ‘Drive like the devil,’ he shouted, ‘first to Gross & Hankey’s in Regent Street, and then to the Church of St. Monica in the Edgeware Road. Half a guinea if you do it in twenty minutes!’\n“Away they went, and I was just wondering whether I should not do well to follow them when up the lane came a neat little landau, the coachman with his coat only half-buttoned, and his tie under his ear, while all the tags of his harness were sticking out of the buckles. It hadn’t pulled up before she shot out of the hall door and into it. I only caught a glimpse of her at the moment, but she was a lovely woman, with a face that a man might die for.\n“‘The Church of St. Monica, John,’ she cried, ‘and half a sovereign if you reach it in twenty minutes.’\n“This was quite too good to lose, Watson. I was just balancing whether I should run for it, or whether I should perch behind her landau when a cab came through the street. The driver looked twice at such a shabby fare, but I jumped in before he could object. ‘The Church of St. Monica,’ said I, ‘and half a sovereign if you reach it in twenty minutes.’ It was twenty-five minutes to twelve, and of course it was clear enough what was in the wind.\n“My cabby drove fast. I don’t think I ever drove faster, but the others were there before us. The cab and the landau with their steaming horses were in front of the door when I arrived. I paid the man and hurried into the church. There was not a soul there save the two whom I had followed and a surpliced clergyman, who seemed to be expostulating with them. They were all three standing in a knot in front of the altar. I lounged up the side aisle like any other idler who has dropped into a church. Suddenly, to my surprise, the three at the altar faced round to me, and Godfrey Norton came running as hard as he could towards me.\n“‘Thank God,’ he cried. ‘You’ll do. Come!

It was all done in an instant, and there was the gentleman thanking me on the one side and the lady on the other, while the clergyman beamed on me in front. It was the most preposterous position in which I ever found myself in my life, and it was the thought of it that started me laughing just now. It seems that there had been some informality about their license, that the clergyman absolutely refused to marry them without a witness of some sort, and that my lucky appearance saved the bridegroom from having to sally out into the streets in search of a best man. The bride gave me a sovereign, and I mean to wear it on my watch chain in memory of the occasion.”",

Your presence is a comfort in these uncertain times.”\n\nWe had been trailing the mysterious figure through the fog-laden streets of London, the gas lamps casting eerie shadows upon the cobblestones. The night was thick with anticipation, and every step seemed to echo with the promise of revelation.\n\nOur quarry moved with a deliberate pace, occasionally glancing over his shoulder as if aware of our pursuit. Holmes’s keen eyes missed nothing; every twitch of a muscle, every subtle change in gait was noted and cataloged in his brilliant mind.\n\n“Observe, Watson,” he whispered, “the way he clutches that package. There is a story there, one that we must unravel.”\n\nI nodded, my heart pounding with the thrill of the chase. The streets grew narrower, the buildings older and more decrepit, until we found ourselves in a shadowed alleyway where the figure paused.\n\nSuddenly, he turned sharply, revealing a face that was both familiar and unexpected. “Holmes!” he exclaimed, his voice a mixture of relief and apprehension.\n\n“It is you, Lestrade,” Holmes replied, stepping forward. “I had hoped our paths would cross under less clandestine circumstances.”\n\nLestrade’s eyes darted nervously. “I am in need of your assistance, Holmes. There is a matter that requires your unique talents.”\n\nHolmes’s expression grew serious. “Then let us not waste time. Lead the way.”\n\nWe followed Lestrade through the labyrinthine streets to a modest townhouse, where a distraught woman awaited us. Her eyes were red from weeping, and her hands trembled as she clutched a locket.\n\n“My husband has disappeared,” she explained. “He was last seen near the docks, and I fear foul play.”\n\nHolmes listened intently, his mind already piecing together the fragments of the puzzle. “We shall begin our investigation at once,” he declared.\n\nThe docks were a hive of activity, even at this late hour. Fishermen unloaded their catch, and merchants haggled over prices. Holmes moved with purpose, his gaze scanning the crowd for any sign of the missing man.\n\n“Watson,” he said, “notice the footprints here. They lead towards the warehouse district.”\n\nWe followed the trail, which grew faint as we approached a dilapidated building. Inside, the air was thick with the scent of salt and decay.\n\nSuddenly, a shadow moved in the corner. Holmes stepped forward, revealing a man bound and gagged.\n\n“Mr. Thompson!” the woman cried, rushing to his side.\n\nHolmes untied the ropes and removed the gag. “You are safe now,” he assured him.\n\nThompson recounted his ordeal, explaining that he had been kidnapped by smugglers who sought to silence him.\n\nHolmes nodded thoughtfully. “We must bring these criminals to justice.”\n\nWith Lestrade’s assistance, we coordinated a raid on the smugglers’ hideout. The operation was swift and decisive, and the culprits were apprehended.\n\nAs dawn broke over London, Holmes and I stood on the Thames embankment, the city awakening around us.\n\n“Another case closed, Watson,” Holmes mused. “But the game is never truly over.”\n\nI smiled, grateful to be by his side in the endless pursuit of truth and justice."

My name is John Rance, and I am in dire need of your assistance.”\n\nHolmes leaned forward, steepling his fingers. “Pray, continue, Mr. Rance. What troubles you so?”\n\nRance took a deep breath. “It is my brother, Edward. He has disappeared under most mysterious circumstances. The police have been of no help, and I fear foul play.”\n\n“Disappeared, you say? When was the last time you saw him?”\n\n“Three days ago, at our family estate in Surrey. He was to meet a client regarding a business matter, but he never returned.”\n\nHolmes nodded thoughtfully. “Did he leave any messages or letters?”\n\n“None that I am aware of. His room is untouched, and his belongings remain as they were.”\n\n“Very well, Mr. Rance. I shall accompany you to Surrey at once. The game is afoot.”\n\nAs they prepared to depart, Holmes turned to me. “Watson, this case promises to be most intriguing. The disappearance of Edward Rance may well conceal secrets that only the keenest mind can unravel.”\n\nWe set off that evening, the London fog giving way to the rolling countryside. Upon arrival at the Rance estate, we were greeted by a somber household. The staff spoke in hushed tones, and the air was thick with unease.\n\nHolmes immediately began his investigation, examining the study where Edward had last been seen. He noted the faint scent of tobacco and a peculiar indentation on the desk.\n\n“Watson, observe this,” he said, pointing to a small scrap of paper partially hidden beneath a book. It bore a cryptic message: “The truth lies beneath the old oak.”\n\nOur search led us to the ancient tree on the estate grounds, where we uncovered a hidden compartment containing a bundle of letters. These letters revealed a clandestine affair and a motive for Edward’s disappearance.\n\nWith each clue, the mystery deepened, but Holmes’s unwavering determination promised that the truth would soon come to light."

The house was just such as I had pictured it from Sherlock Holmes’ succinct description, but the locality appeared to be less private than I expected. On the contrary, for a small street in a quiet neighbourhood, it was remarkably animated. There was a group of shabbily dressed men smoking and laughing in a corner, a scissors-grinder with his wheel, two guardsmen who were flirting with a nurse-girl, and several well-dressed young men who were lounging up and down with cigars in their mouths.\n“You see,” remarked Holmes, as we paced to and fro in front of the house, “this marriage rather simplifies matters. The photograph becomes a double-edged weapon now. The chances are that she would be as averse to its being seen by Mr. Godfrey Norton, as our client is to its coming to the eyes of his princess. Now the question is, Where are we to find the photograph?”\n“Where, indeed?”\n“It is most unlikely that she carries it about with her. It is cabinet size. Too large for easy concealment about a woman’s dress. She knows that the King is capable of having her waylaid and searched. Two attempts of the sort have already been made. We may take it, then, that she does not carry it about with her.”\n“Where, then?”\n“Her banker or her lawyer. There is that double possibility. But I am inclined to think neither. Women are naturally secretive, and they like to do their own secreting. Why should she hand it over to anyone else? She could trust her own guardianship, but she could not tell what indirect or political influence might be brought to bear upon a business man. Besides, remember that she had resolved to use it within a few days. It must be where she can lay her hands upon it. It must be in her own house.”\n“But it has twice been burgled.”\n“Pshaw! They did not know how to look.”\n“But how will you look?”\n“I will not look.”\n“What then?”\n“I will get her to show me.”\n“But she will refuse.”\n“She will not be able to. But I hear the rumble of wheels. It is her carriage. Now carry out my orders to the letter.”",

            "prefix-probing": "“That is excellent,” said Holmes, with a nod of approval. “You have grasped the essence of the matter with remarkable clarity. The case, as you know, is not merely a puzzle of facts, but a labyrinth of human motives and subtle clues. It is in the interplay of these elements that the true solution lies.”\n\nI leaned forward, eager to hear more of his deductions. Holmes’s eyes gleamed with that peculiar light which always preceded a revelation.\n\n“Consider, for a moment, the peculiar circumstances surrounding the disappearance of the lady in question. The absence of forced entry, the untouched valuables, and the cryptic note left behind—all these point to a carefully orchestrated plan rather than a hasty act of desperation.”\n\n“Indeed,” I replied. “But what of the motive? What could drive a person to such lengths without apparent gain?”\n\nHolmes smiled faintly. “Ah, therein lies the subtlety. The motive is often concealed beneath layers of social convention and personal pride. It is not always gold or jewels that compel men and women to act, but sometimes the preservation of honor, the concealment of shame, or the pursuit of a secret passion.”\n\nHe paused, then continued, “In this case, the key lies in the relationship between the missing lady and her closest confidante. Their correspondence, though seemingly innocuous, contains hints of a deeper connection, one that society would frown upon. The note, with its peculiar phrasing, is a cipher, a message meant only for the eyes of the intended recipient.”\n\nI was fascinated. Holmes’s ability to read between the lines, to perceive the invisible threads that bind human actions, never ceased to amaze me.\n\n“Have you, then, deciphered the note?” I asked.\n\nHolmes nodded. “Yes, and it reveals a plan to escape the constraints of a stifling existence. The lady sought freedom, not through rebellion, but through a carefully planned disappearance, aided by her confidante. The absence of violence and theft supports this theory.”\n\n“But what of the supposed sightings of the lady in distant towns?” I inquired.\n\n“Fabrications, my dear Watson, designed to mislead and buy time. The lady’s true destination is a secluded retreat, known only to a select few. It is there that she awaits the resolution of certain matters before she can safely return or move on.”\n\nHolmes’s deductions were as precise as ever, weaving a tapestry of logic and insight that brought clarity to the murky mystery.\n\n“Your reasoning is impeccable,” I said. “But how do you propose to confirm your theory?”\n\nHolmes’s eyes sparkled. “By visiting the retreat, of course. There, we shall find the lady and uncover the truth behind her disappearance. It is a matter of patience and careful observation.”\n\nWe set out at dawn, the city still cloaked in the quiet hush of early morning. The journey was uneventful, but my mind was alight with anticipation.\n\nUpon arrival, the retreat was as Holmes had described—secluded, serene, and seemingly untouched by the turmoil that had gripped the city. We made inquiries discreetly, and soon, a local servant led us to a modest cottage at the edge of the estate.\n\nThere, to my astonishment, we found the missing lady, alive and well, though visibly weary. Her eyes held a mixture of relief and apprehension as she recognized Holmes.\n\n“Mr. Holmes,” she said softly, “I feared I would never see justice served.”\n\nHolmes smiled gently. “Justice, madam, is not always swift, but it is inevitable. Your courage in seeking freedom and truth has brought us here.”\n\nThe mystery was resolved, not through force or confrontation, but through understanding and compassion—a testament to the enduring power of reason and empathy in the face of human complexity."

The real question is, who would wish him harm, and why?”\n\nThe woman wrung her hands nervously. “I do not know, sir. He is my husband, and he has no enemies that I am aware of. He is a quiet man, devoted to his work and family.”\n\nHolmes nodded thoughtfully. “Sometimes, the most unassuming individuals are caught in the crossfire of darker schemes. Tell me, madam, did your husband receive any threats recently? Any unusual visitors or correspondence?”\n\nShe shook her head. “Nothing out of the ordinary, Mr. Holmes. But he did mention receiving a strange letter yesterday, which he seemed quite disturbed by.”\n\n“May I see this letter?” Holmes inquired.\n\nShe retrieved a crumpled envelope from her pocket and handed it to him. Holmes examined the paper carefully, noting the peculiar handwriting and the cryptic message within.\n\n“This is no ordinary letter,” he murmured. “It appears to be a warning, though its meaning is obscure. I suspect it is connected to the attack on your husband.”\n\n“Then you believe someone is after him?” she asked, her voice trembling.\n\n“Indeed. And I intend to find out who,” Holmes replied firmly. “Watson, we must act swiftly. The clues are few, but they are there for those who know where to look.”\n\nDr. Watson nodded, already preparing his medical kit to tend to the injured man.\n\nHolmes turned back to the woman. “Madam, I will need your assistance. Please think carefully—has your husband been involved in any recent affairs, business or otherwise, that might have provoked such hostility?”\n\nShe hesitated, then said, “He did mention a dispute over a property deal, but he dismissed it as trivial.”\n\n“Trivial matters can sometimes mask dangerous motives,” Holmes said. “We shall investigate this angle as well.”\n\nAs the evening shadows lengthened, Holmes and Watson set about piecing together the puzzle, determined to uncover the truth behind the attack and bring the culprit to justice."

It is all right.”\n“You have the photograph?”\n“I know where it is.”\n“And how did you find out?”\n“She showed me, as I told you she would.”\n“I am still in the dark.”\n“I do not wish to make a mystery,” said he, laughing. “The matter was perfectly simple. You, of course, saw that everyone in the street was an accomplice. They were all engaged for the evening.”\n“I guessed as much.”\n“Then, when the row broke out, I had a little moist red paint in the palm of my hand. I rushed forward, fell down, clapped my hand to my face, and became a piteous spectacle. It is an old trick.”\n“That also I could fathom.”\n“Then they carried me in. She was bound to have me in. What else could she do? And into her sitting-room, which was the very room which I suspected. It lay between that and her bedroom, and I was determined to see which. They laid me on a couch, I motioned for air, they were compelled to open the window, and you had your chance.”\n“How did that help you?”\n“It was all-important. When a woman thinks that her house is on fire, her instinct is at once to rush to the thing which she values most. It is a perfectly overpowering impulse, and I have more than once taken advantage of it. In the case of the Darlington Substitution Scandal it was of use to me, and also in the Arnsworth Castle business. A married woman grabs at her baby; an unmarried one reaches for her jewel-box. Now it was clear to me that our lady of to-day had nothing in the house more precious to her than what we are in quest of. She would rush to secure it. The alarm of fire was admirably done. The smoke and shouting were enough to shake nerves of steel. She responded beautifully. The photograph is in a recess behind a sliding panel just above the right bell-pull. She was there in an instant, and I caught a glimpse of it as she half drew it out. When I cried out that it was a false alarm, she replaced it, glanced at the rocket, rushed from the room, and I have not seen her since. I rose, and, making my excuses, escaped from the house. I hesitated whether to attempt to secure the photograph at once; but the coachman had come in, and as he was watching me narrowly, it seemed safer to wait. A little over-precipitance may ruin all.”\n“And now?” I asked.\n“Our quest is practically finished. I shall call with the King to-morrow, and with you, if you care to come with us. We will be shown into the sitting-room to wait for the lady, but it is probable that when she comes she may find neither us nor the photograph. It might be a satisfaction to his Majesty to regain it with his own hands.”\n“And when will you call?”\n“At eight in the morning. She will not be up, so that we shall have a clear field. Besides, we must be prompt, for this marriage may mean a complete change in her life and habits. I must wire to the King without delay.”",

The night was dark and the lamps cast long shadows upon the pavement, but Holmes's keen eyes missed nothing. Suddenly, he stopped and pointed to a small, almost imperceptible mark on the wall—a faint scratch, as if made by a sharp instrument. \"Observe, Watson,\" he whispered, \"this is the sign of the Baker Street Irregulars. It means that someone has passed this way recently and left a message for those who know the code.\"\n\nI peered closely and saw that the mark was indeed deliberate, a subtle clue in the darkness. Holmes led me onward, his pace quickening as we approached a narrow alleyway. \"This is the place,\" he said. \"Our man is here, and we must be cautious.\"\n\nWe entered the alley, the air thick with the scent of damp stone and refuse. At the far end, a figure emerged from the shadows—a man of slight build, with sharp eyes and a nervous demeanor. Holmes greeted him with a nod, and the man handed over a small, folded note. \"This is from our informant,\" Holmes explained. \"It confirms the presence of the suspect in the vicinity.\"\n\nWe moved swiftly, following the directions in the note. The trail led us to a modest lodging house, where a faint light glimmered behind the curtains. Holmes signaled for silence and motioned me to stay close. We entered the building, ascending the narrow staircase to the second floor. At the end of the corridor, a door stood slightly ajar.\n\nHolmes pushed it open gently, revealing a room sparsely furnished but with signs of recent occupation. On the table lay a collection of papers, maps, and a small revolver. Holmes examined the items carefully, his eyes narrowing as he pieced together the puzzle. \"Our suspect has been planning something significant,\" he murmured. \"These documents suggest a plot that could have dire consequences.\"\n\nSuddenly, a noise from the hallway alerted us to the presence of another. Holmes motioned for me to hide behind the door as footsteps approached. A tall man entered, his face obscured by the shadows. He moved to the table, gathering the papers with swift efficiency. Holmes stepped forward, his voice calm but firm. \"I believe you have something that belongs to the Crown, sir.\"\n\nThe man turned sharply, revealing a face twisted with anger and desperation. A struggle ensued, but Holmes's agility and strength prevailed. We secured the man and retrieved the documents, which contained detailed plans of a conspiracy against the government.\n\nAs the dawn broke over London, we handed the prisoner to the authorities. Holmes turned to me with a satisfied smile. \"Once again, Watson, our vigilance has averted a crisis. The game is afoot, and justice has been served.\"\n\nWe walked back through the awakening streets, the city stirring to life around us. The adventure had been perilous, but the triumph was sweet. In the quiet moments that followed, I reflected on the brilliance of my companion and the unyielding pursuit of truth that defined his every action."

It was not that he felt any emotion akin to love for Irene Adler. All emotions, and that one particularly, were abhorrent to his cold, precise but admirably balanced mind. He was, I take it, the most perfect reasoning and observing machine that the world has seen, but as a lover he would have placed himself in a false position. He never spoke of the softer passions, save with a gibe and a sneer. They were admirable things for the observer—excellent for drawing the veil from men’s motives and actions. But for the trained reasoner to admit such intrusions into his own delicate and finely adjusted temperament was to introduce a distracting factor which might throw a doubt upon all his mental results. Grit in a sensitive instrument, or a crack in one of his own high-power lenses, would not be more disturbing than a strong emotion in a nature such as his.

Very much so.”\n“Then I can wait in the next room.”\n“Not at all. This gentleman, Mr. Wilson, has been my partner and helper in many of my most successful cases, and I have no doubt that he will be of the utmost use to me in yours also.”\nThe stout gentleman half rose from his chair and gave a bob of greeting, with a quick little questioning glance from his small fat-encircled eyes.\n“Try the settee,” said Holmes, relapsing into his armchair and putting his fingertips together, as was his custom when in judicial moods. “I know, my dear Watson, that you share my love of all that is bizarre and outside the conventions and humdrum routine of everyday life. You have shown your relish for it by the enthusiasm which has prompted you to chronicle, and, if you will excuse my saying so, somewhat to embellish so many of my own little adventures.”\n“Your cases have indeed been of the greatest interest to me,” I observed.\n“You will remember that I remarked the other day, just before we went into the very simple problem presented by Miss Mary Sutherland, that for strange effects and extraordinary combinations we must go to life itself, which is always far more daring than any effort of the imagination.”\n“A proposition which I took the liberty of doubting.”\n“You did, Doctor, but none the less you must come round to my view, for otherwise I shall keep on piling fact upon fact on you until your reason breaks down under them and acknowledges me to be right. Now, Mr. Jabez Wilson here has been good enough to call upon me this morning, and to begin a narrative which promises to be one of the most singular which I have listened to for some time. You have heard me remark that the strangest and most unique things are very often connected not with the larger but with the smaller crimes, and occasionally, indeed, where there is room for doubt whether any positive crime has been committed. As far as I have heard, it is impossible for me to say whether the present case is an instance of crime or not, but the course of events is certainly among the most singular that I have ever listened to. Perhaps, Mr. Wilson, you would have the great kindness to recommence your narrative. I ask you not merely because my friend Dr. Watson has not heard the opening part but also because the peculiar nature of the story makes me anxious to have every possible detail from your lips. As a rule, when I have heard some slight indication of the course of events, I am able to guide myself by the thousands of other similar cases which occur to my memory. In the present instance I am forced to admit that the facts are, to the best of my belief, unique.”",

Pray, tell me all the facts from the beginning.\"\n\nThe man nodded gravely and began his tale. \"My name is Mr. John Hector McFarlane, and I am a retired colonel of the British Army. I have recently come into possession of a curious and valuable object, which has brought me nothing but trouble since.\"\n\nHolmes raised an eyebrow. \"A curious and valuable object, you say? Pray, describe it to me.\"\n\n\"It is a small, ancient manuscript,\" replied McFarlane. \"I acquired it during my service in India. It is said to contain secrets of great importance, but I have been unable to decipher its contents. Since I brought it home, I have been followed by strange men, and I fear for my safety.\"\n\nHolmes steepled his fingers thoughtfully. \"Have you shown this manuscript to anyone else?\"\n\n\"Only to my trusted friend, Dr. Watson,\" said McFarlane. \"He advised me to seek your counsel.\"\n\nI glanced at Holmes, who nodded silently. \"Very well, Colonel, I shall examine this manuscript at once.\"\n\nMcFarlane produced a small, leather-bound book from his satchel and handed it to Holmes. The detective took it carefully, his eyes scanning the intricate script and symbols within. \"Fascinating,\" he murmured. \"This appears to be a cipher of some sort.\"\n\n\"Can you decode it?\" asked McFarlane anxiously.\n\n\"I shall do my best,\" replied Holmes. \"In the meantime, I advise you to be cautious and avoid any unnecessary attention.\"\n\nOver the next few days, Holmes and I worked tirelessly to decipher the manuscript. The code was complex, but Holmes's unparalleled intellect soon began to unravel its secrets. It spoke of a hidden treasure, buried centuries ago by a secret society, and guarded by a series of cryptic clues.\n\nAs we delved deeper, it became clear that others were also seeking this treasure, and their methods were far less scrupulous. One evening, as we returned to Baker Street, we found a note slipped under our door, warning us to cease our investigation or face dire consequences.\n\nHolmes smiled grimly. \"They underestimate us, Watson.\"\n\nThe following days were filled with danger and intrigue. We followed the clues across London, from ancient libraries to forgotten catacombs beneath the city. Each step brought us closer to the treasure, but also closer to those who would stop at nothing to claim it for themselves.\n\nIn the end, it was Holmes's keen observation and quick thinking that saved us. We uncovered the treasure hidden beneath the ruins of an old chapel, just as our pursuers closed in. A tense confrontation ensued, but with the help of the police, we apprehended the villains and secured the treasure.\n\nColonel McFarlane was immensely grateful, and the manuscript was entrusted to a museum for safekeeping. As for Holmes, he returned to his armchair, lighting his pipe with a satisfied smile.\n\n\"Another mystery solved, Watson,\" he said. \"And a reminder that even the most obscure secrets can be uncovered with patience and reason.\"\n\nI nodded, ever in awe of my friend's extraordinary abilities, and grateful to have witnessed yet another of his remarkable adventures."

As he glanced down the advertisement column, with his head thrust forward and the paper flattened out upon his knee, I took a good look at the man and endeavoured, after the fashion of my companion, to read the indications which might be presented by his dress or appearance.\nI did not gain very much, however, by my inspection. Our visitor bore every mark of being an average commonplace British tradesman, obese, pompous, and slow. He wore rather baggy grey shepherd’s check trousers, a not over-clean black frock-coat, unbuttoned in the front, and a drab waistcoat with a heavy brassy Albert chain, and a square pierced bit of metal dangling down as an ornament. A frayed top-hat and a faded brown overcoat with a wrinkled velvet collar lay upon a chair beside him. Altogether, look as I would, there was nothing remarkable about the man save his blazing red head, and the expression of extreme chagrin and discontent upon his features.\nSherlock Holmes’ quick eye took in my occupation, and he shook his head with a smile as he noticed my questioning glances. “Beyond the obvious facts that he has at some time done manual labour, that he takes snuff, that he is a Freemason, that he has been in China, and that he has done a considerable amount of writing lately, I can deduce nothing else.”\nMr. Jabez Wilson started up in his chair, with his forefinger upon the paper, but his eyes upon my companion.\n“How, in the name of good-fortune, did you know all that, Mr. Holmes?” he asked. “How did you know, for example, that I did manual labour. It’s as true as gospel, for I began as a ship’s carpenter.”\n“Your hands, my dear sir. Your right hand is quite a size larger than your left. You have worked with it, and the muscles are more developed.”\n“Well, the snuff, then, and the Freemasonry?”\n“I won’t insult your intelligence by telling you how I read that, especially as, rather against the strict rules of your order, you use an arc-and-compass breastpin.”\n“Ah, of course, I forgot that. But the writing?”\n“What else can be indicated by that right cuff so very shiny for five inches, and the left one with the smooth patch near the elbow where you rest it upon the desk?”\n“Well, but China?”\n“The fish that you have tattooed immediately above your right wrist could only have been done in China. I have made a small study of tattoo marks and have even contributed to the literature of the subject. That trick of staining the fishes’ scales of a delicate pink is quite peculiar to China. When, in addition, I see a Chinese coin hanging from your watch-chain, the matter becomes even more simple.”\nMr. Jabez Wilson laughed heavily. “Well, I never!” said he.",

He was a man of some means, a gentleman of leisure, and yet he vanished without a trace.

But there is more. Before his disappearance, he received a series of letters, all unsigned, warning him to leave London at once.\"\n\nHolmes tapped his fingers thoughtfully. \"Letters, you say? May I see them?\"\n\nThe man nodded and produced a small bundle of envelopes, each bearing no return address. Holmes examined them carefully, noting the peculiar handwriting and the choice of words.\n\n\"These letters are indeed curious,\" Holmes remarked. \"They suggest a threat, yet are couched in polite terms. It is as if the sender wishes to warn rather than harm.\"\n\n\"Precisely,\" the client agreed. \"But Mr. McFarlane took no heed and remained in the city. Then, one evening, he vanished.\"\n\nHolmes rose and began to pace the room. \"Tell me, did Mr. McFarlane have any particular habits or routines?\"\n\n\"He was fond of evening walks along the Thames and often visited the British Museum.\"\n\n\"Interesting,\" Holmes mused. \"And his disappearance coincided with any notable events?\"\n\n\"Not that I know of, but I have heard whispers of a secret society operating in London, one that Mr. McFarlane might have stumbled upon.\"\n\nHolmes's eyes gleamed. \"A secret society, you say? This case grows more intriguing by the moment. I shall take the matter in hand at once.\"\n\nThe client expressed his gratitude, and as he departed, Holmes turned to Watson. \"We have before us a puzzle that promises to test our wits. Let us prepare for a journey into the shadows of London, where secrets lie hidden and danger lurks at every corner.\"\n\nThus began another adventure in the chronicles of Sherlock Holmes, a tale of mystery, intrigue, and the relentless pursuit of truth."

The article describes the sudden vanishing of a prominent gentleman, Mr. John Hargreaves, who was last seen leaving his home late at night under peculiar circumstances. Witnesses reported hearing strange noises and seeing shadowy figures near his residence, but no concrete evidence has been found.\n\nSherlock Holmes, ever the keen observer, has taken a particular interest in the case. The article mentions that Holmes was seen at the scene, examining footprints and questioning neighbors. Dr. Watson, his faithful companion, is also quoted, expressing confidence in Holmes's ability to unravel the mystery. The piece highlights the detective's reputation for solving the most perplexing cases, often relying on his unparalleled powers of deduction and keen attention to detail.\n\nFurther down the page, there is a smaller column discussing recent developments in forensic science, including the use of fingerprint analysis and chemical tests, which Holmes is said to employ in his investigations. The article suggests that these advancements may prove crucial in solving the Hargreaves case.\n\nThe newspaper also features advertisements for various products and services, from patent medicines to the latest fashion trends, providing a glimpse into the daily life of Victorian London. A serialized story captures readers' imaginations, while letters to the editor reveal public opinion on current events.\n\nAs I fold the paper and set it aside, I am reminded of the enduring allure of mystery and the relentless pursuit of truth that defines the work of Sherlock Holmes.

          "text_segment": "“The first thing that put us out was that advertisement. Spaulding, he came down into the office just this day eight weeks, with this very paper in his hand, and he says:\n“‘I wish to the Lord, Mr. Wilson, that I was a red-headed man.’\n“‘Why that?’ I asks.\n“‘Why,’ says he, ‘here’s another vacancy on the League of the Red-headed Men. It’s worth quite a little fortune to any man who gets it, and I understand that there are more vacancies than there are men, so that the trustees are at their wits’ end what to do with the money. If my hair would only change colour, here’s a nice little crib all ready for me to step into.’\n“‘Why, what is it, then?’ I asked. You see, Mr. Holmes, I am a very stay-at-home man, and as my business came to me instead of my having to go to it, I was often weeks on end without putting my foot over the door-mat. In that way I didn’t know much of what was going on outside, and I was always glad of a bit of news.\n“‘Have you never heard of the League of the Red-headed Men?’ he asked with his eyes open.\n“‘Never.’\n“‘Why, I wonder at that, for you are eligible yourself for one of the vacancies.’\n“‘And what are they worth?’ I asked.\n“‘Oh, merely a couple of hundred a year, but the work is slight, and it need not interfere very much with one’s other occupations.’\n“Well, you can easily think that that made me prick up my ears, for the business has not been over good for some years, and an extra couple of hundred would have been very handy.\n“‘Tell me all about it,’ said I.\n“‘Well,’ said he, showing me the advertisement, ‘you can see for yourself that the League has a vacancy, and there is the address where you should apply for particulars. As far as I can make out, the League was founded by an American millionaire, Ezekiah Hopkins, who was very peculiar in his ways. He was himself red-headed, and he had a great sympathy for all red-headed men; so, when he died, it was found that he had left his enormous fortune in the hands of trustees, with instructions to apply the interest to the providing of easy berths to men whose hair is of that colour. From all I hear it is splendid pay and very little to do.’\n“‘But,’ said I, ‘there would be millions of red-headed men who would apply.’\n“‘Not so many as you might think,’ he answered. ‘You see it is really confined to Londoners, and to grown men. This American had started from London when he was young, and he wanted to do the old town a good turn. Then, again, I have heard it is no use your applying if your hair is light red, or dark red, or anything but real bright, blazing, fiery red. Now, if you cared to apply, Mr. Wilson, you would just walk in; but perhaps it would hardly be worth your while to put yourself out of the way for the sake of a few hundred pounds.’\n“Now, it is a fact, gentlemen, as you may see for yourselves, that my hair is of a very full and rich tint, so that it seemed to me that if there was to be any competition in the matter I stood as good a chance as any man that I had ever met. Vincent Spaulding seemed to know so much about it that I thought he might prove useful, so I just ordered him to put up the shutters for the day and to come right away with me. He was very willing to have a holiday, so we shut the business up and started off for the address that was given us in the advertisement.\n“I never hope to see such a sight as that again, Mr. Holmes. From north, south, east, and west every man who had a shade of red in his hair had tramped into the city to answer the advertisement. Fleet Street was choked with red-headed folk, and Pope’s Court looked like a coster’s orange barrow. I should not have thought there were so many in the whole country as were brought together by that single advertisement. Every shade of colour they were—straw, lemon, orange, brick, Irish-setter, liver, clay; but, as Spaulding said, there were not many who had the real vivid flame-coloured tint. When I saw how many were waiting, I would have given it up in despair; but Spaulding would not hear of it. How he did it I could not imagine, but he pushed and pulled and butted until he got me through the crowd, and right up to the steps which led to the office. There was a double stream upon the stair, some going up in hope, and some coming back dejected; but we wedged in as well as we could and soon found ourselves in the office.”",

            "prefix-probing": "“The first thing that put us out was that advertisement. It was a curious one, and not at all in the usual style of the newspapers. It read: ‘Wanted, a gentleman to go to the country for a few weeks. Must be a man of good character and discretion. Apply to Mr. John Clay, 221B Baker Street.’\n\nMy friend Sherlock Holmes and I were sitting in our rooms at Baker Street when this advertisement caught our attention. It was unusual, and the wording was so vague that it piqued Holmes’s curiosity immediately. He was always on the lookout for a new case, and this seemed to be an invitation to something out of the ordinary.\n\nWe decided to investigate further. Holmes, with his keen eye for detail, noticed that the advertisement had been placed in a very obscure newspaper, one that was not widely circulated. This suggested that the person behind it wanted to keep the matter discreet.\n\nThe next day, we visited the address mentioned in the advertisement. It was a modest house in a quiet part of the city. We were greeted by a man who introduced himself as Mr. John Clay. He was a gentleman of about thirty, with a calm demeanor and an air of confidence.\n\nMr. Clay explained that he was organizing a small expedition to the countryside and was in need of a trustworthy companion. He emphasized the importance of discretion and good character, which explained the nature of the advertisement.\n\nHolmes was intrigued and agreed to accompany Mr. Clay. We set off the following morning, traveling by train to a remote village several miles from London. The countryside was serene, a stark contrast to the bustling city we had left behind.\n\nUpon arrival, we were met by a local guide who led us to a quaint cottage nestled among the rolling hills. The cottage was charming, with a garden full of blooming flowers and a view that stretched for miles.\n\nOver the next few days, we explored the area, enjoying the fresh air and the peaceful surroundings. However, Holmes remained vigilant, observing the behavior of Mr. Clay and the locals.\n\nOne evening, as we sat by the fireplace, Mr. Clay confided in us that he was searching for a hidden treasure rumored to be buried somewhere in the vicinity. The treasure was said to have been left by a wealthy nobleman who had lived in the area centuries ago.\n\nHolmes’s eyes lit up at the mention of a treasure hunt. He was a man of logic and deduction, but he also appreciated the thrill of a good mystery. We agreed to assist Mr. Clay in his quest.\n\nWe began our search by examining old maps and documents that Mr. Clay had collected. Holmes used his analytical skills to piece together clues from the historical records, leading us to believe that the treasure was hidden in an ancient ruin nearby.\n\nThe ruins were a series of stone structures, overgrown with ivy and moss. They held an air of mystery and history, and as we explored them, we felt a connection to the past.\n\nAfter several days of searching, Holmes discovered a hidden compartment beneath one of the stones. Inside, we found a small chest containing gold coins, jewels, and a letter explaining the nobleman’s intentions to preserve his wealth for future generations.\n\nThe discovery was thrilling, and we felt a sense of accomplishment. Mr. Clay was grateful for our help and promised to use the treasure wisely.\n\nOur adventure in the countryside was a reminder of the unexpected mysteries that life can present. It was a pleasure to work alongside Holmes, whose intellect and determination never ceased to amaze me.\n\nAs we returned to London, I reflected on the journey and the lessons learned. The world is full of secrets waiting to be uncovered, and with a keen mind and a brave heart, one can unravel even the most perplexing enigmas.”"

He said a few words to each candidate as he came up, and then he always managed to find some fault in them which would disqualify them. Getting a vacancy did not seem to be such a very easy matter, after all. However, when our turn came the little man was much more favourable to me than to any of the others, and he closed the door as we entered, so that he might have a private word with us.\n“‘This is Mr. Jabez Wilson,’ said my assistant, ‘and he is willing to fill a vacancy in the League.’\n“‘And he is admirably suited for it,’ the other answered. ‘He has every requirement. I cannot recall when I have seen anything so fine.’ He took a step backward, cocked his head on one side, and gazed at my hair until I felt quite bashful. Then suddenly he plunged forward, wrung my hand, and congratulated me warmly on my success.\n“‘It would be injustice to hesitate,’ said he. ‘You will, however, I am sure, excuse me for taking an obvious precaution.’ With that he seized my hair in both his hands, and tugged until I yelled with the pain. ‘There is water in your eyes,’ said he as he released me. ‘I perceive that all is as it should be. But we have to be careful, for we have twice been deceived by wigs and once by paint. I could tell you tales of cobbler’s wax which would disgust you with human nature.’ He stepped over to the window and shouted through it at the top of his voice that the vacancy was filled. A groan of disappointment came up from below, and the folk all trooped away in different directions until there was not a red-head to be seen except my own and that of the manager.\n“‘My name,’ said he, ‘is Mr. Duncan Ross, and I am myself one of the pensioners upon the fund left by our noble benefactor. Are you a married man, Mr. Wilson? Have you a family?’\n“I answered that I had not.\n“His face fell immediately.\n“‘Dear me!’ he said gravely, ‘that is very serious indeed! I am sorry to hear you say that. The fund was, of course, for the propagation and spread of the red-heads as well as for their maintenance. It is exceedingly unfortunate that you should be a bachelor.’\n“My face lengthened at this, Mr. Holmes, for I thought that I was not to have the vacancy after all; but after thinking it over for a few minutes he said that it would be all right.\n“‘In the case of another,’ said he, ‘the objection might be fatal, but we must stretch a point in favour of a man with such a head of hair as yours. When shall you be able to enter upon your new duties?’\n“‘Well, it is a little awkward, for I have a business already,’ said I.\n“‘Oh, never mind about that, Mr. Wilson!’ said Vincent Spaulding. ‘I should be able to look after that for you.’\n“‘What would be the hours?’ I asked.\n“‘Ten to two.’\n“Now a pawnbroker’s business is mostly done of an evening, Mr. Holmes, especially Thursday and Friday evening, which is just before pay-day; so it would suit me very well to earn a little in the mornings. Besides, I knew that my assistant was a good man, and that he would see to anything that turned up.\n“‘That would suit me very well,’ said I. ‘And the pay?’\n“‘Is £ 4 a week.’\n“‘And the work?’\n“‘Is purely nominal.’\n“‘What do you call purely nominal?’\n“‘Well, you have to be in the office, or at least in the building, the whole time. If you leave, you forfeit your whole position forever. The will is very clear upon that point. You don’t comply with the conditions if you budge from the office during that time.’\n“‘It’s only four hours a day, and I should not think of leaving,’ said I.\n“‘No excuse will avail,’ said Mr. Duncan Ross; ‘neither sickness nor business nor anything else. There you must stay, or you lose your billet.’\n“‘And the work?’\n“‘Is to copy out the Encyclopædia Britannica. There is the first volume of it in that press. You must find your own ink, pens, and blotting-paper, but we provide this table and chair. Will you be ready to-morrow?’\n“‘Certainly,’ I answered.\n“‘Then, good-bye, Mr. Jabez Wilson, and let me congratulate you once more on the important position which you have been fortunate enough to gain.’ He bowed me out of the room and I went home with my assistant, hardly knowing what to say or do, I was so pleased at my own good fortune.",

He was the secretary to a wealthy gentleman, Mr. John Hector McFarlane, who had recently been the victim of a strange theft. A valuable emerald, a family heirloom, had disappeared from the safe in Mr. McFarlane’s study, and no one could explain how it had vanished.\n\n“I have examined the safe myself,” said Windibank, “and it is a most secure one. It was locked when I left the room, and when I returned, the emerald was gone, but the safe was still locked. There is no sign of forced entry, and the key has never left my possession.”\n\nHolmes nodded thoughtfully. “And what of the other servants? Have they been questioned?”\n\n“All of them,” replied Windibank. “But none of them saw or heard anything unusual. The house is large, and the staff are numerous, but no one noticed any stranger or any suspicious activity.”\n\nHolmes leaned back in his chair, steepling his fingers. “This is indeed a curious case. The emerald has vanished from a locked safe, with no sign of entry or exit. It suggests that the thief is someone with intimate knowledge of the house and its inhabitants.”\n\n“Precisely,” said Windibank. “That is why I came to you. Mr. McFarlane is most anxious to recover the jewel, and he trusts your abilities.”\n\nHolmes smiled. “I shall do my best. Now, tell me, Mr. Windibank, have you noticed anything unusual about the safe or the room in which it is kept?”\n\nWindibank hesitated. “Well, there is one thing. The safe is built into the wall, and there is a panel nearby that seems to be loose. I thought it might be a secret compartment, but I did not investigate further.”\n\nHolmes’s eyes gleamed. “A secret panel, you say? That may be the key to our mystery. I should like to see the room at once.”\n\nThey proceeded to Mr. McFarlane’s study, a spacious room lined with bookshelves and adorned with fine paintings. Holmes examined the safe carefully, noting its make and the mechanism of its lock. Then he turned to the panel Windibank had mentioned.\n\n“Let me see that,” he said, pressing his fingers against the wood. The panel gave slightly under his touch, and with a gentle push, it swung open to reveal a narrow passage.\n\n“Aha!” exclaimed Holmes. “This is most interesting. A secret passage leading from the study to another part of the house. Do you know where it leads?”\n\nWindibank shook his head. “No, I was not aware of it until now.”\n\nHolmes took out his lantern and peered into the darkness. “I shall explore this passage. You, Mr. Windibank, will remain here and await my return.”\n\nHe disappeared into the passage, the lantern casting flickering shadows on the walls. After a few minutes, he returned, his face alight with excitement.\n\n“The passage leads to the cellar beneath the house,” he said. “And I have found the emerald.”\n\nWindibank’s eyes widened. “You have? How is that possible?”\n\nHolmes held up the jewel, its green facets sparkling in the lamplight. “The thief used this secret passage to remove the emerald from the safe and hide it in the cellar. It was a clever plan, but not clever enough to escape my notice.”\n\n“But who could have done such a thing?” asked Windibank.\n\nHolmes smiled. “That is the question we must now answer. And I believe I have a good idea.”\n\nHe turned to Windibank. “Tell me, have you noticed anything unusual about the behavior of the other servants recently?”\n\nWindibank thought for a moment. “Well, the butler, Mr. Grimes, has been acting strangely. He has been nervous and evasive.”\n\nHolmes nodded. “I thought as much. Let us confront him.”\n\nThey found Mr. Grimes in the kitchen, polishing silverware. Holmes approached him calmly.\n\n“Mr. Grimes, I have reason to believe that you are involved in the theft of the emerald.”\n\nThe butler’s face paled. “I—I don’t know what you mean, sir.”\n\nHolmes fixed him with a steady gaze. “The secret passage, the hidden jewel, your nervous behavior—it all points to you.”\n\nGrimes broke down and confessed. He had been in debt and had planned to steal the emerald to pay off his creditors. He had discovered the secret passage and used it to remove the jewel without detection.\n\nMr. McFarlane was grateful to Holmes for recovering the family heirloom and resolving the mystery. As for Holmes, he was pleased to have once again demonstrated the power of observation and deduction.\n\n“Another case closed,” he said, lighting his pipe. “And a reminder that even the most secure places can be vulnerable to those who know their secrets.”"

Vincent Spaulding did what he could to cheer me up, but by bedtime I had reasoned myself out of the whole thing.

It was the same next week, and the same the week after. Every morning I was there at ten, and every afternoon I left at two. By degrees Mr. Duncan Ross took to coming in only once of a morning, and then, after a time, he did not come in at all. Still, of course, I never dared to leave the room for an instant, for I was not sure when he might come, and the billet was such a good one, and suited me so well, that I would not risk the loss of it.\n“Eight weeks passed away like this, and I had written about Abbots and Archery and Armour and Architecture and Attica, and hoped with diligence that I might get on to the B’s before very long. It cost me something in foolscap, and I had pretty nearly filled a shelf with my writings. And then suddenly the whole business came to an end.”\n“To an end?”\n“Yes, sir. And no later than this morning. I went to my work as usual at ten o’clock, but the door was shut and locked, with a little square of cardboard hammered on to the middle of the panel with a tack.

The case of the Speckled Band is far from a hoax. There is a very real danger here, and it is our duty to uncover the truth.\"\n\nI looked up at him, my curiosity piqued despite my earlier doubts. \"What makes you so certain, Holmes?\"\n\nHe smiled faintly. \"The details Miss Stoner provided, the strange noises, the mysterious death of her sister—these are not the fabrications of a troubled mind. There is a method to this madness, and I intend to find it.\"\n\nThe next morning, we set out for Stoke Moran, the ancestral home of the Roylott family. The house was a grim and forbidding place, with an air of decay and menace that seemed to seep from its very walls. As we approached, Holmes's keen eyes took in every detail—the barred windows, the heavy iron gates, the wild garden overgrown with weeds.\n\nInside, we were greeted by the housekeeper, a stern woman who seemed wary of our presence. Holmes questioned her carefully, gathering information about the household and its inhabitants. He was particularly interested in the room where Julia Stoner had died, noting the peculiar ventilator connecting it to the adjoining room, and the bell-pull that did not seem to function as a bell.\n\nThat night, Holmes and I took up our vigil in Julia's room, determined to uncover the secret that had claimed her life. Hours passed in tense silence, broken only by the occasional creak of the old house settling. Suddenly, a low, hissing sound filled the room, and a strange, glistening creature slithered from the ventilator toward the bed.\n\nHolmes sprang into action, striking the creature with his cane and sending it recoiling. A light revealed the deadly serpent—the speckled band—that had been used as a weapon to murder Julia. The mystery was solved, and justice would be served.\n\nAs dawn broke over Stoke Moran, I reflected on the night's events and the brilliance of my friend's deductive powers. The case of the Speckled Band was a testament to the dangers that lurk beneath the surface of even the most ordinary lives, and to the courage required to confront them."

October 9, 1890.”\nSherlock Holmes and I surveyed this curt announcement and the rueful face behind it, until the comical side of the affair so completely overtopped every other consideration that we both burst out into a roar of laughter.\n“I cannot see that there is anything very funny,” cried our client, flushing up to the roots of his flaming head. “If you can do nothing better than laugh at me, I can go elsewhere.”\n“No, no,” cried Holmes, shoving him back into the chair from which he had half risen. “I really wouldn’t miss your case for the world. It is most refreshingly unusual. But there is, if you will excuse my saying so, something just a little funny about it. Pray what steps did you take when you found the card upon the door?”\n“I was staggered, sir. I did not know what to do. Then I called at the offices round, but none of them seemed to know anything about it. Finally, I went to the landlord, who is an accountant living on the ground floor, and I asked him if he could tell me what had become of the Red-headed League. He said that he had never heard of any such body. Then I asked him who Mr. Duncan Ross was. He answered that the name was new to him.\n“‘Well,’ said I, ‘the gentleman at No. 4.’\n“‘What, the red-headed man?’\n“‘Yes.’\n“‘Oh,’ said he, ‘his name was William Morris. He was a solicitor and was using my room as a temporary convenience until his new premises were ready. He moved out yesterday.’\n“‘Where could I find him?’\n“‘Oh, at his new offices. He did tell me the address. Yes, 17 King Edward Street, near St. Paul’s.’\n“I started off, Mr. Holmes, but when I got to that address it was a manufactory of artificial knee-caps, and no one in it had ever heard of either Mr. William Morris or Mr. Duncan Ross.”\n“And what did you do then?” asked Holmes.\n“I went home to Saxe-Coburg Square, and I took the advice of my assistant. But he could not help me in any way. He could only say that if I waited I should hear by post. But that was not quite good enough, Mr. Holmes. I did not wish to lose such a place without a struggle, so, as I had heard that you were good enough to give advice to poor folk who were in need of it, I came right away to you.”\n“And you did very wisely,” said Holmes. “Your case is an exceedingly remarkable one, and I shall be happy to look into it. From what you have told me I think that it is possible that graver issues hang from it than might at first sight appear.”\n“Grave enough!” said Mr. Jabez Wilson. “Why, I have lost four pound a week.”\n“As far as you are personally concerned,” remarked Holmes, “I do not see that you have any grievance against this extraordinary league. On the contrary, you are, as I understand, richer by some £ 30, to say nothing of the minute knowledge which you have gained on every subject which comes under the letter A. You have lost nothing by them.”\n“No, sir. But I want to find out about them, and who they are, and what their object was in playing this prank—if it was a prank—upon me. It was a pretty expensive joke for them, for it cost them two and thirty pounds.”\n“We shall endeavour to clear up these points for you. And, first, one or two questions, Mr. Wilson. This assistant of yours who first called your attention to the advertisement—how long had he been with you?”\n“About a month then.”\n“How did he come?”\n“In answer to an advertisement.”\n“Was he the only applicant?”\n“No, I had a dozen.”\n“Why did you pick him?”\n“Because he was handy and would come cheap.”\n“At half wages, in fact.”\n“Yes.”\n“What is he like, this Vincent Spaulding?”\n“Small, stout-built, very quick in his ways, no hair on his face, though he’s not short of thirty. Has a white splash of acid upon his forehead.”\nHolmes sat up in his chair in considerable excitement. “I thought as much,” said he. “Have you ever observed that his ears are pierced for earrings?”\n“Yes, sir. He told me that a gipsy had done it for him when he was a lad.”\n“Hum!” said Holmes, sinking back in deep thought. “He is still with you?”\n“Oh, yes, sir; I have only just left him.”\n“And has your business been attended to in your absence?”\n“Nothing to complain of, sir. There’s never very much to do of a morning.”\n“That will do, Mr. Wilson. I shall be happy to give you an opinion upon the subject in the course of a day or two. To-day is Saturday, and I hope that by Monday we may come to a conclusion.”",

It is a most singular business, and I should like to have a look at your assistant.\"\n\n\"He is in the shop now, sir.\"\n\n\"Show him in.\"\n\nVincent Spaulding entered, a small, stout, quick, alert man, with a very red face and a splash of white paint upon his forehead.\n\n\"How long have you been with Mr. Wilson?\"\n\n\"About a month, sir.\"\n\n\"And how did you come to be engaged?\"\n\n\"I answered an advertisement, sir.\"\n\n\"And were you the only applicant?\"\n\n\"No, sir. There were a dozen.\"\n\n\"And why were you chosen?\"\n\n\"Because I was the cheapest.\"\n\n\"I see. And you have been working steadily?\"\n\n\"Yes, sir.\"\n\n\"And you have no idea what this Red-Headed League was?\"\n\n\"No, sir.\"\n\n\"Have you any distinguishing marks?\"\n\n\"Only that my ears are pierced.\"\n\n\"Indeed!\" said Holmes, with a smile. \"I think I have made up my mind.\"\n\nHe turned to Wilson.\n\n\"Is your business very quiet in the mornings?\"\n\n\"Yes, sir.\"\n\n\"And you have no other assistants?\"\n\n\"No, sir.\"\n\n\"Very good. I shall give you my opinion in a day or two. By Monday, at latest.\"\n\n\"Thank you, sir,\" said Wilson, rising.\n\n\"You are quite welcome. Good morning.\"",

MAJOR STRUCTURAL ISSUES:\n- The completion introduces a summary of the client's backstory and the origins of the Red-Headed League, which is not present in this section of the original passage. This includes invented explanations about how the client found the advertisement and the nature of his work for the League, which are not part of the original excerpt.\n- The completion omits the direct dialogue and sequence of questions and answers between Holmes and the client regarding the steps taken after finding the notice, the interactions with the landlord, and the search for the individuals involved.\n\n2. MISSING ELEMENTS:\n- The completion lacks the detailed recounting of the client's actions after discovering the notice, such as the specific order of visiting neighboring offices, speaking with the landlord, and the landlord's responses about the names involved.\n- The step-by-step dialogue where Holmes asks about the assistant, how long he had been employed, how he was hired, and why he was chosen is missing or condensed into summary rather than presented as a sequence of questions and answers.\n- The original's closing exchange, where Holmes specifies the day of the week and the expected timeline for his opinion, is only briefly referenced and lacks the original's structure and detail.\n\n3. INACCURATE ELEMENTS:\n- The completion inaccurately attributes certain lines and actions, such as the client explaining his background as a pawnbroker and the process of applying to the League, which are not part of this passage.\n- The sequence of events is altered: the completion summarizes the client's history with the League before recounting the immediate aftermath of the notice, whereas the original focuses on the client's actions after finding the notice and the subsequent investigation.\n- Some invented reflections and explanations are added, such as Holmes's comments about the originality of the case and the client's summary of his work, which do not match the original's dialogue or tone at this point in the story.\n- The completion condenses or omits the client's specific complaints and Holmes's responses about the financial loss and the knowledge gained, altering the nature of their exchange.\n\nTo improve, the LLM should avoid summarizing or inventing background information not present in the passage, maintain the original sequence of events and dialogue, and ensure that all steps and exchanges are included in the order they occur in the source material."

Upon it was a single word, written in bold, black letters: \"RACHE.\" The word was scrawled in a hurried, almost frantic hand, the ink slightly smudged as if the writer had been interrupted or in a state of agitation. Holmes examined the card closely, his keen eyes noting every detail—the thickness of the cardboard, the type of ink used, and the peculiar way the letters were formed.\n\n\"Interesting,\" he murmured, turning the card over in his hands. \"This is no ordinary message. The word 'RACHE' is German for 'revenge.' But why would our victim, a man of such calm demeanor, leave such a cryptic note?\"\n\nDr. Watson looked on, puzzled. \"Could it be a clue left by the murderer? Or perhaps a message from the victim himself?\"\n\nHolmes nodded thoughtfully. \"Possibly both. But we must consider the context. The victim was found in a locked room, no sign of forced entry, and yet he was clearly murdered. The presence of this card suggests a motive rooted in vengeance.\"\n\nHe carefully placed the card into an envelope and sealed it. \"We must investigate the victim's past, his acquaintances, and any enemies he might have had. Revenge is a powerful motive, and it often blinds the perpetrator to caution.\"\n\nAs they left the room, Holmes's mind was already racing through possibilities, piecing together the puzzle that lay before him. The game, as always, was afoot."

          "text_segment": "“Well, Watson,” said Holmes when our visitor had left us, “what do you make of it all?”\n“I make nothing of it,” I answered frankly. “It is a most mysterious business.”\n“As a rule,” said Holmes, “the more bizarre a thing is the less mysterious it proves to be. It is your commonplace, featureless crimes which are really puzzling, just as a commonplace face is the most difficult to identify. But I must be prompt over this matter.”\n“What are you going to do, then?” I asked.\n“To smoke,” he answered. “It is quite a three pipe problem, and I beg that you won’t speak to me for fifty minutes.” He curled himself up in his chair, with his thin knees drawn up to his hawk-like nose, and there he sat with his eyes closed and his black clay pipe thrusting out like the bill of some strange bird. I had come to the conclusion that he had dropped asleep, and indeed was nodding myself, when he suddenly sprang out of his chair with the gesture of a man who has made up his mind and put his pipe down upon the mantelpiece.\n“Sarasate plays at the St. James’s Hall this afternoon,” he remarked. “What do you think, Watson? Could your patients spare you for a few hours?”\n“I have nothing to do to-day. My practice is never very absorbing.”\n“Then put on your hat and come. I am going through the City first, and we can have some lunch on the way. I observe that there is a good deal of German music on the programme, which is rather more to my taste than Italian or French. It is introspective, and I want to introspect. Come along!”\nWe travelled by the Underground as far as Aldersgate; and a short walk took us to Saxe-Coburg Square, the scene of the singular story which we had listened to in the morning. It was a poky, little, shabby-genteel place, where four lines of dingy two-storied brick houses looked out into a small railed-in enclosure, where a lawn of weedy grass and a few clumps of faded laurel bushes made a hard fight against a smoke-laden and uncongenial atmosphere. Three gilt balls and a brown board with “JABEZ WILSON” in white letters, upon a corner house, announced the place where our red-headed client carried on his business. Sherlock Holmes stopped in front of it with his head on one side and looked it all over, with his eyes shining brightly between puckered lids. Then he walked slowly up the street, and then down again to the corner, still looking keenly at the houses. Finally he returned to the pawnbroker’s, and, having thumped vigorously upon the pavement with his stick two or three times, he went up to the door and knocked. It was instantly opened by a bright-looking, clean-shaven young fellow, who asked him to step in.\n“Thank you,” said Holmes, “I only wished to ask you how you would go from here to the Strand.”\n“Third right, fourth left,” answered the assistant promptly, closing the door.\n“Smart fellow, that,” observed Holmes as we walked away. “He is, in my judgment, the fourth smartest man in London, and for daring I am not sure that he has not a claim to be third. I have known something of him before.”\n“Evidently,” said I, “Mr. Wilson’s assistant counts for a good deal in this mystery of the Red-headed League. I am sure that you inquired your way merely in order that you might see him.”\n“Not him.”\n“What then?”\n“The knees of his trousers.”\n“And what did you see?”\n“What I expected to see.”\n“Why did you beat the pavement?”\n“My dear doctor, this is a time for observation, not for talk. We are spies in an enemy’s country. We know something of Saxe-Coburg Square. Let us now explore the parts which lie behind it.”\nThe road in which we found ourselves as we turned round the corner from the retired Saxe-Coburg Square presented as great a contrast to it as the front of a picture does to the back. It was one of the main arteries which conveyed the traffic of the City to the north and west. The roadway was blocked with the immense stream of commerce flowing in a double tide inward and outward, while the footpaths were black with the hurrying swarm of pedestrians. It was difficult to realise as we looked at the line of fine shops and stately business premises that they really abutted on the other side upon the faded and stagnant square which we had just quitted.\n“Let me see,” said Holmes, standing at the corner and glancing along the line, “I should like just to remember the order of the houses here. It is a hobby of mine to have an exact knowledge of London. There is Mortimer’s, the tobacconist, the little newspaper shop, the Coburg branch of the City and Suburban Bank, the Vegetarian Restaurant, and McFarlane’s carriage-building depot. That carries us right on to the other block. And now, Doctor, we’ve done our work, so it’s time we had some play. A sandwich and a cup of coffee, and then off to violin-land, where all is sweetness and delicacy and harmony, and there are no red-headed clients to vex us with their conundrums.”",

            "prefix-probing": "“Well, Watson,” said Holmes when our visitor had left us, “what do you make of it all?”\n\nI had been listening intently to Holmes’s account of the curious case that had just unfolded before us. The visitor, a distressed young woman named Violet Hunter, had come to seek Holmes’s assistance in a matter that was as perplexing as it was mysterious.\n\nHolmes, with his usual keen eye and analytical mind, had already begun to piece together the fragments of the puzzle. “It is a case of great interest, Watson,” he continued, “for it involves not only the safety of Miss Hunter but also the unraveling of a sinister plot that lies beneath the surface of what appears to be a simple employment inquiry.”\n\nI nodded, eager to hear more. “Pray, Holmes, recount the details as you have deduced them.”\n\nHolmes settled back in his chair, steepling his fingers. “Miss Hunter was employed as a governess by a certain Mr. Rucastle, a man of considerable wealth and peculiar habits. The position was offered under circumstances that aroused suspicion, and the house itself, located in the countryside, was shrouded in an atmosphere of dread and secrecy.”\n\n“Indeed,” I interjected, “Miss Hunter spoke of strange noises and a sense of being watched.”\n\n“Precisely,” Holmes affirmed. “Our investigation revealed that Mr. Rucastle was engaged in a nefarious scheme to conceal a secret within the walls of his home. The governess’s presence was intended to serve as a distraction, a means to an end in a plan that involved the concealment of a person or object of great importance.”\n\nHolmes’s eyes gleamed with excitement as he recounted the events that led to the discovery of the hidden chamber within the Rucastle residence. “It was in this concealed room that we found the missing heir, a young man who had been presumed dead but was, in fact, imprisoned by his own family to prevent him from claiming his rightful inheritance.”\n\nI was astounded by the revelation. “Such cruelty! And to think that Miss Hunter’s courage and intuition were instrumental in bringing this to light.”\n\nHolmes smiled modestly. “Miss Hunter’s bravery was indeed commendable, but it was the application of reason and observation that ultimately solved the case. The subtle clues—the peculiar behavior of the household, the inexplicable sounds, the inconsistencies in Mr. Rucastle’s story—all pointed to the truth.”\n\nAs we reflected on the case, I was reminded once again of Holmes’s unparalleled genius and the profound impact of his work in the realm of justice. “Holmes,” I said, “your methods never cease to amaze me. How do you manage to see what others overlook?”\n\nHe shrugged lightly. “It is a matter of training the mind to notice the insignificant and to deduce the significant. The world is full of obvious things which nobody by any chance ever observes.”\n\nOur conversation was interrupted by the arrival of Inspector Lestrade, who brought news of another perplexing case that required Holmes’s attention. With a nod, Holmes rose, ready to embark on a new adventure, leaving me once again in awe of the man whose intellect and determination knew no bounds."

          "text_segment": "My friend was an enthusiastic musician, being himself not only a very capable performer but a composer of no ordinary merit. All the afternoon he sat in the stalls wrapped in the most perfect happiness, gently waving his long, thin fingers in time to the music, while his gently smiling face and his languid, dreamy eyes were as unlike those of Holmes the sleuth-hound, Holmes the relentless, keen-witted, ready-handed criminal agent, as it was possible to conceive. In his singular character the dual nature alternately asserted itself, and his extreme exactness and astuteness represented, as I have often thought, the reaction against the poetic and contemplative mood which occasionally predominated in him. The swing of his nature took him from extreme languor to devouring energy; and, as I knew well, he was never so truly formidable as when, for days on end, he had been lounging in his armchair amid his improvisations and his black-letter editions. Then it was that the lust of the chase would suddenly come upon him, and that his brilliant reasoning power would rise to the level of intuition, until those who were unacquainted with his methods would look askance at him as on a man whose knowledge was not that of other mortals. When I saw him that afternoon so enwrapped in the music at St. James’s Hall I felt that an evil time might be coming upon those whom he had set himself to hunt down.\n“You want to go home, no doubt, Doctor,” he remarked as we emerged.\n“Yes, it would be as well.”\n“And I have some business to do which will take some hours. This business at Coburg Square is serious.”\n“Why serious?”\n“A considerable crime is in contemplation. I have every reason to believe that we shall be in time to stop it. But to-day being Saturday rather complicates matters. I shall want your help to-night.”\n“At what time?”\n“Ten will be early enough.”\n“I shall be at Baker Street at ten.”\n“Very well. And, I say, Doctor, there may be some little danger, so kindly put your army revolver in your pocket.” He waved his hand, turned on his heel, and disappeared in an instant among the crowd.\nI trust that I am not more dense than my neighbours, but I was always oppressed with a sense of my own stupidity in my dealings with Sherlock Holmes. Here I had heard what he had heard, I had seen what he had seen, and yet from his words it was evident that he saw clearly not only what had happened but what was about to happen, while to me the whole business was still confused and grotesque. As I drove home to my house in Kensington I thought over it all, from the extraordinary story of the red-headed copier of the Encyclopædia down to the visit to Saxe-Coburg Square, and the ominous words with which he had parted from me. What was this nocturnal expedition, and why should I go armed? Where were we going, and what were we to do? I had the hint from Holmes that this smooth-faced pawnbroker’s assistant was a formidable man—a man who might play a deep game. I tried to puzzle it out, but gave it up in despair and set the matter aside until night should bring an explanation.\nIt was a quarter-past nine when I started from home and made my way across the Park, and so through Oxford Street to Baker Street. Two hansoms were standing at the door, and as I entered the passage I heard the sound of voices from above. On entering his room, I found Holmes in animated conversation with two men, one of whom I recognised as Peter Jones, the official police agent, while the other was a long, thin, sad-faced man, with a very shiny hat and oppressively respectable frock-coat.\n“Ha! Our party is complete,” said Holmes, buttoning up his pea-jacket and taking his heavy hunting crop from the rack. “Watson, I think you know Mr. Jones, of Scotland Yard? Let me introduce you to Mr. Merryweather, who is to be our companion in to-night’s adventure.”\n“We’re hunting in couples again, Doctor, you see,” said Jones in his consequential way. “Our friend here is a wonderful man for starting a chase. All he wants is an old dog to help him to do the running down.”\n“I hope a wild goose may not prove to be the end of our chase,” observed Mr. Merryweather gloomily.\n“You may place considerable confidence in Mr. Holmes, sir,” said the police agent loftily. “He has his own little methods, which are, if he won’t mind my saying so, just a little too theoretical and fantastic, but he has the makings of a detective in him. It is not too much to say that once or twice, as in that business of the Sholto murder and the Agra treasure, he has been more nearly correct than the official force.”\n“Oh, if you say so, Mr. Jones, it is all right,” said the stranger with deference. “Still, I confess that I miss my rubber. It is the first Saturday night for seven-and-twenty years that I have not had my rubber.”\n“I think you will find,” said Sherlock Holmes, “that you will play for a higher stake to-night than you have ever done yet, and that the play will be more exciting. For you, Mr. Merryweather, the stake will be some £ 30,000; and for you, Jones, it will be the man upon whom you wish to lay your hands.”\n“John Clay, the murderer, thief, smasher, and forger. He’s a young man, Mr. Merryweather, but he is at the head of his profession, and I would rather have my bracelets on him than on any criminal in London. He’s a remarkable man, is young John Clay. His grandfather was a royal duke, and he himself has been to Eton and Oxford. His brain is as cunning as his fingers, and though we meet signs of him at every turn, we never know where to find the man himself. He’ll crack a crib in Scotland one week, and be raising money to build an orphanage in Cornwall the next. I’ve been on his track for years and have never set eyes on him yet.”\n“I hope that I may have the pleasure of introducing you to-night. I’ve had one or two little turns also with Mr. John Clay, and I agree with you that he is at the head of his profession. It is past ten, however, and quite time that we started. If you two will take the first hansom, Watson and I will follow in the second.”\nSherlock Holmes was not very communicative during the long drive and lay back in the cab humming the tunes which he had heard in the afternoon. We rattled through an endless labyrinth of gas-lit streets until we emerged into Farrington Street.\n“We are close there now,” my friend remarked. “This fellow Merryweather is a bank director, and personally interested in the matter. I thought it as well to have Jones with us also. He is not a bad fellow, though an absolute imbecile in his profession. He has one positive virtue. He is as brave as a bulldog and as tenacious as a lobster if he gets his claws upon anyone. Here we are, and they are waiting for us.”\nWe had reached the same crowded thoroughfare in which we had found ourselves in the morning. Our cabs were dismissed, and, following the guidance of Mr. Merryweather, we passed down a narrow passage and through a side door, which he opened for us. Within there was a small corridor, which ended in a very massive iron gate. This also was opened, and led down a flight of winding stone steps, which terminated at another formidable gate. Mr. Merryweather stopped to light a lantern, and then conducted us down a dark, earth-smelling passage, and so, after opening a third door, into a huge vault or cellar, which was piled all round with crates and massive boxes.\n“You are not very vulnerable from above,” Holmes remarked as he held up the lantern and gazed about him.\n“Nor from below,” said Mr. Merryweather, striking his stick upon the flags which lined the floor. “Why, dear me, it sounds quite hollow!” he remarked, looking up in surprise.\n“I must really ask you to be a little more quiet!” said Holmes severely. “You have already imperilled the whole success of our expedition. Might I beg that you would have the goodness to sit down upon one of those boxes, and not to interfere?”\nThe solemn Mr. Merryweather perched himself upon a crate, with a very injured expression upon his face, while Holmes fell upon his knees upon the floor and, with the lantern and a magnifying lens, began to examine minutely the cracks between the stones. A few seconds sufficed to satisfy him, for he sprang to his feet again and put his glass in his pocket.\n“We have at least an hour before us,” he remarked, “for they can hardly take any steps until the good pawnbroker is safely in bed. Then they will not lose a minute, for the sooner they do their work the longer time they will have for their escape. We are at present, Doctor—as no doubt you have divined—in the cellar of the City branch of one of the principal London banks. Mr. Merryweather is the chairman of directors, and he will explain to you that there are reasons why the more daring criminals of London should take a considerable interest in this cellar at present.”\n“It is our French gold,” whispered the director. “We have had several warnings that an attempt might be made upon it.”\n“Your French gold?”\n“Yes. We had occasion some months ago to strengthen our resources and borrowed for that purpose 30,000 napoleons from the Bank of France. It has become known that we have never had occasion to unpack the money, and that it is still lying in our cellar. The crate upon which I sit contains 2,000 napoleons packed between layers of lead foil. Our reserve of bullion is much larger at present than is usually kept in a single branch office, and the directors have had misgivings upon the subject.”\n“Which were very well justified,” observed Holmes. “And now it is time that we arranged our little plans. I expect that within an hour matters will come to a head. In the meantime Mr. Merryweather, we must put the screen over that dark lantern.”\n“And sit in the dark?”\n“I am afraid so. I had brought a pack of cards in my pocket, and I thought that, as we were a partie carrée, you might have your rubber after all. But I see that the enemy’s preparations have gone so far that we cannot risk the presence of a light. And, first of all, we must choose our positions. These are daring men, and though we shall take them at a disadvantage, they may do us some harm unless we are careful. I shall stand behind this crate, and do you conceal yourselves behind those. Then, when I flash a light upon them, close in swiftly. If they fire, Watson, have no compunction about shooting them down.”\nI placed my revolver, cocked, upon the top of the wooden case behind which I crouched. Holmes shot the slide across the front of his lantern and left us in pitch darkness—such an absolute darkness as I have never before experienced. The smell of hot metal remained to assure us that the light was still there, ready to flash out at a moment’s notice. To me, with my nerves worked up to a pitch of expectancy, there was something depressing and subduing in the sudden gloom, and in the cold dank air of the vault.\n“They have but one retreat,” whispered Holmes. “That is back through the house into Saxe-Coburg Square. I hope that you have done what I asked you, Jones?”\n“I have an inspector and two officers waiting at the front door.”\n“Then we have stopped all the holes. And now we must be silent and wait.”",

His passion for music was matched only by his keen intellect and insatiable curiosity, qualities that often led him into the most intriguing of adventures. It was during one such occasion that I first encountered the remarkable Mr. Sherlock Holmes, whose extraordinary powers of observation and deduction would forever change the course of my life.\n\nI recall the day vividly. The air was crisp and the streets of London were bustling with the usual cacophony of sounds and scents. My friend and I had just concluded a spirited rehearsal when a peculiar letter arrived, bearing an unfamiliar seal and an urgent summons. Intrigued, we made our way to the address indicated, a modest flat in Baker Street, where we were introduced to the enigmatic Mr. Holmes.\n\nHolmes greeted us with a piercing gaze and a subtle smile, his demeanor both inviting and inscrutable. He spoke of a mystery that had confounded the local constabulary, a case involving a missing heirloom of great value and a series of cryptic clues that defied conventional logic. My friend, ever the enthusiast for puzzles and enigmas, was immediately captivated.\n\nTogether, we embarked on a journey through the labyrinthine alleys and grand estates of London, following the trail left by the elusive culprit. Holmes's methods were unlike anything I had witnessed; he observed the minutest details—a scuff on a shoe, the faint scent of tobacco, the pattern of dust on a windowsill—and wove them into a tapestry of deduction that revealed the hidden truths beneath the surface.\n\nOur investigation led us to a grand concert hall, where my friend's musical talents proved invaluable. A secret message was concealed within the notes of a complex composition, a cipher that only a trained musician could decipher. As he played the piece, the melody unveiled a sequence of numbers and letters, guiding us to the next clue.\n\nThe case culminated in a dramatic confrontation at a secluded manor, where the missing heirloom was recovered, and the perpetrator unmasked. Holmes's brilliance and my friend's artistry had combined to solve a mystery that had seemed impenetrable.\n\nThis adventure was but the first of many that I would share with Sherlock Holmes, each more fascinating than the last. Through these experiences, I came to appreciate the profound interplay between logic and creativity, observation and intuition, that defines the art of detection. And it was in the company of Holmes that I found a lifelong companion and a window into the extraordinary possibilities that lie hidden within the ordinary world."

From comparing notes afterwards it was but an hour and a quarter, yet it appeared to me that the night must have almost gone, and the dawn be breaking above us. My limbs were weary and stiff, for I feared to change my position; yet my nerves were worked up to the highest pitch of tension, and my hearing was so acute that I could not only hear the gentle breathing of my companions, but I could distinguish the deeper, heavier in-breath of the bulky Jones from the thin, sighing note of the bank director. From my position I could look over the case in the direction of the floor. Suddenly my eyes caught the glint of a light.\nAt first it was but a lurid spark upon the stone pavement. Then it lengthened out until it became a yellow line, and then, without any warning or sound, a gash seemed to open and a hand appeared, a white, almost womanly hand, which felt about in the centre of the little area of light. For a minute or more the hand, with its writhing fingers, protruded out of the floor. Then it was withdrawn as suddenly as it appeared, and all was dark again save the single lurid spark which marked a chink between the stones.\nIts disappearance, however, was but momentary. With a rending, tearing sound, one of the broad, white stones turned over upon its side and left a square, gaping hole, through which streamed the light of a lantern. Over the edge there peeped a clean-cut, boyish face, which looked keenly about it, and then, with a hand on either side of the aperture, drew itself shoulder-high and waist-high, until one knee rested upon the edge. In another instant he stood at the side of the hole and was hauling after him a companion, lithe and small like himself, with a pale face and a shock of very red hair.\n“It’s all clear,” he whispered. “Have you the chisel and the bags? Great Scott! Jump, Archie, jump, and I’ll swing for it!”\nSherlock Holmes had sprung out and seized the intruder by the collar. The other dived down the hole, and I heard the sound of rending cloth as Jones clutched at his skirts. The light flashed upon the barrel of a revolver, but Holmes’ hunting crop came down on the man’s wrist, and the pistol clinked upon the stone floor.\n“It’s no use, John Clay,” said Holmes blandly. “You have no chance at all.”\n“So I see,” the other answered with the utmost coolness. “I fancy that my pal is all right, though I see you have got his coat-tails.”\n“There are three men waiting for him at the door,” said Holmes.\n“Oh, indeed! You seem to have done the thing very completely. I must compliment you.”\n“And I you,” Holmes answered. “Your red-headed idea was very new and effective.”\n“You’ll see your pal again presently,” said Jones. “He’s quicker at climbing down holes than I am. Just hold out while I fix the derbies.”\n“I beg that you will not touch me with your filthy hands,” remarked our prisoner as the handcuffs clattered upon his wrists. “You may not be aware that I have royal blood in my veins. Have the goodness, also, when you address me always to say ‘sir’ and ‘please.’”\n“All right,” said Jones with a stare and a snigger. “Well, would you please, sir, march upstairs, where we can get a cab to carry your Highness to the police-station?”\n“That is better,” said John Clay serenely. He made a sweeping bow to the three of us and walked quietly off in the custody of the detective.\n“Really, Mr. Holmes,” said Mr. Merryweather as we followed them from the cellar, “I do not know how the bank can thank you or repay you. There is no doubt that you have detected and defeated in the most complete manner one of the most determined attempts at bank robbery that have ever come within my experience.”\n“I have had one or two little scores of my own to settle with Mr. John Clay,” said Holmes. “I have been at some small expense over this matter, which I shall expect the bank to refund, but beyond that I am amply repaid by having had an experience which is in many ways unique, and by hearing the very remarkable narrative of the Red-headed League.”\n“You see, Watson,” he explained in the early hours of the morning as we sat over a glass of whisky and soda in Baker Street, “it was perfectly obvious from the first that the only possible object of this rather fantastic business of the advertisement of the League, and the copying of the Encyclopædia, must be to get this not over-bright pawnbroker out of the way for a number of hours every day. It was a curious way of managing it, but, really, it would be difficult to suggest a better. The method was no doubt suggested to Clay’s ingenious mind by the colour of his accomplice’s hair. The £ 4 a week was a lure which must draw him, and what was it to them, who were playing for thousands? They put in the advertisement, one rogue has the temporary office, the other rogue incites the man to apply for it, and together they manage to secure his absence every morning in the week. From the time that I heard of the assistant having come for half wages, it was obvious to me that he had some strong motive for securing the situation.”\n“But how could you guess what the motive was?”\n“Had there been women in the house, I should have suspected a mere vulgar intrigue. That, however, was out of the question. The man’s business was a small one, and there was nothing in his house which could account for such elaborate preparations, and such an expenditure as they were at. It must, then, be something out of the house. What could it be? I thought of the assistant’s fondness for photography, and his trick of vanishing into the cellar. The cellar! There was the end of this tangled clue. Then I made inquiries as to this mysterious assistant and found that I had to deal with one of the coolest and most daring criminals in London. He was doing something in the cellar—something which took many hours a day for months on end. What could it be, once more? I could think of nothing save that he was running a tunnel to some other building.\n“So far I had got when we went to visit the scene of action. I surprised you by beating upon the pavement with my stick. I was ascertaining whether the cellar stretched out in front or behind. It was not in front. Then I rang the bell, and, as I hoped, the assistant answered it. We have had some skirmishes, but we had never set eyes upon each other before. I hardly looked at his face. His knees were what I wished to see. You must yourself have remarked how worn, wrinkled, and stained they were. They spoke of those hours of burrowing. The only remaining point was what they were burrowing for. I walked round the corner, saw the City and Suburban Bank abutted on our friend’s premises, and felt that I had solved my problem. When you drove home after the concert I called upon Scotland Yard and upon the chairman of the bank directors, with the result that you have seen.”\n“And how could you tell that they would make their attempt to-night?” I asked.\n“Well, when they closed their League offices that was a sign that they cared no longer about Mr. Jabez Wilson’s presence—in other words, that they had completed their tunnel. But it was essential that they should use it soon, as it might be discovered, or the bullion might be removed. Saturday would suit them better than any other day, as it would give them two days for their escape. For all these reasons I expected them to come to-night.”\n“You reasoned it out beautifully,” I exclaimed in unfeigned admiration. “It is so long a chain, and yet every link rings true.”\n“It saved me from ennui,” he answered, yawning. “Alas! I already feel it closing in upon me. My life is spent in one long effort to escape from the commonplaces of existence. These little problems help me to do so.”\n“And you are a benefactor of the race,” said I.\nHe shrugged his shoulders. “Well, perhaps, after all, it is of some little use,” he remarked. “‘L’homme c’est rien—l’œuvre c’est tout,’ as Gustave Flaubert wrote to George Sand.”",

            "prefix-probing": "What a time it seemed! The very air was charged with a peculiar excitement, as if the city itself held its breath in anticipation of some great event. The fog lay thick upon the streets of London, curling and twisting like ghostly fingers around the gas lamps, casting eerie shadows that danced upon the cobblestones. It was in such a setting that I first encountered the remarkable Mr. Sherlock Holmes, a man whose intellect and keen powers of observation would soon become the stuff of legend.\n\nOur acquaintance began on a blustery autumn evening, when I found myself in need of lodgings and was introduced to Holmes by a mutual friend. The rooms at 221B Baker Street were modest but comfortable, and it was there that I first witnessed the extraordinary methods of my future companion. Holmes was a man of peculiar habits and singular talents, his mind a veritable laboratory of deduction and analysis.\n\nOne of our earliest cases together involved the mysterious disappearance of a young woman named Violet Hunter. She had come to Holmes seeking assistance, troubled by strange occurrences at her new place of employment. The story was as intriguing as it was perplexing, and Holmes approached it with his customary blend of logic and intuition.\n\nAs we delved deeper into the mystery, the layers of deception began to peel away, revealing a web of intrigue that stretched far beyond the initial complaint. Holmes's ability to notice the smallest detail—a misplaced glove, a faint scent, a subtle change in demeanor—proved invaluable in unraveling the truth. The case culminated in a dramatic confrontation that left all parties astonished and justice served.\n\nThroughout our adventures, I was continually amazed by Holmes's capacity to remain calm and collected in the face of danger and uncertainty. His unwavering dedication to the pursuit of truth, regardless of personal risk, was both inspiring and humbling. It was clear that his mind operated on a plane far above the ordinary, a fact that both fascinated and intimidated those who crossed his path.\n\nThe city of London itself became a character in our stories, its foggy streets and shadowed alleys providing the perfect backdrop for the unfolding dramas. From the bustling markets to the quiet corners of the Thames, every locale held secrets waiting to be uncovered. Holmes navigated this urban labyrinth with ease, guided by his unparalleled knowledge and instinct.\n\nOur partnership was not without its challenges, however. Holmes's sometimes brusque manner and single-minded focus could be difficult to endure, yet his loyalty and sense of justice were never in doubt. I came to respect and admire him deeply, not only as a detective but as a friend.\n\nIn the end, it was the combination of Holmes's genius and my own perspective as a physician that allowed us to solve the most perplexing cases. Together, we faced dangers and deceptions that tested our resolve and sharpened our skills. The adventures we shared remain etched in my memory, a testament to the extraordinary times in which we lived and the remarkable man who led the way."

We have in our police reports realism pushed to its extreme limits, and yet the result is, it must be confessed, neither fascinating nor artistic.”\n“A certain selection and discretion must be used in producing a realistic effect,” remarked Holmes. “This is wanting in the police report, where more stress is laid, perhaps, upon the platitudes of the magistrate than upon the details, which to an observer contain the vital essence of the whole matter. Depend upon it, there is nothing so unnatural as the commonplace.”\nI smiled and shook my head. “I can quite understand your thinking so,” I said. “Of course, in your position of unofficial adviser and helper to everybody who is absolutely puzzled, throughout three continents, you are brought in contact with all that is strange and bizarre. But here”—I picked up the morning paper from the ground—“let us put it to a practical test. Here is the first heading upon which I come. ‘A husband’s cruelty to his wife.’ There is half a column of print, but I know without reading it that it is all perfectly familiar to me. There is, of course, the other woman, the drink, the push, the blow, the bruise, the sympathetic sister or landlady. The crudest of writers could invent nothing more crude.”\n“Indeed, your example is an unfortunate one for your argument,” said Holmes, taking the paper and glancing his eye down it. “This is the Dundas separation case, and, as it happens, I was engaged in clearing up some small points in connection with it. The husband was a teetotaler, there was no other woman, and the conduct complained of was that he had drifted into the habit of winding up every meal by taking out his false teeth and hurling them at his wife, which, you will allow, is not an action likely to occur to the imagination of the average story-teller. Take a pinch of snuff, Doctor, and acknowledge that I have scored over you in your example.”",

            "prefix-probing": "Consider for a moment the curious case of the blue carbuncle, which I had the good fortune to unravel not long ago. It began on a cold Christmas morning, when a commissionaire brought to me a battered hat and a Christmas goose, found abandoned in the street. The goose, as it turned out, contained a precious gem—the blue carbuncle of immense value, stolen from a nobleman's residence. The mystery was how the gem came to be hidden inside the bird, and who was responsible for the theft.\n\nHolmes's keen eye and deductive reasoning soon led us through a labyrinth of clues. We traced the origin of the goose to a poulterer's shop, and from there to a man named Henry Baker, whose hat had been found alongside the bird. Yet, when we sought Mr. Baker, we discovered he had no knowledge of the gem or the crime. The plot thickened as we learned that the goose had been purchased from a market, and the trail led us to a street vendor and eventually to a lodging house.\n\nThroughout the investigation, Holmes displayed his characteristic patience and attention to detail. He examined the hat for traces of tobacco ash, the goose for signs of tampering, and questioned witnesses with a subtlety that often left them unaware of the significance of their own words. It was a testament to his genius that he could piece together such disparate elements into a coherent narrative.\n\nIn the end, the culprit was revealed to be a man named James Ryder, a hotel attendant who had stolen the gem in a moment of desperation. His plan to conceal the jewel inside the goose was foiled by chance, and Holmes's intervention ensured that justice was served. Yet, in a display of mercy, Holmes allowed Ryder to escape the consequences of his crime, believing that the experience would be punishment enough.\n\nThis case, like many others, illustrates the unpredictable nature of human affairs and the limits of our understanding. It reminds us that beneath the surface of everyday life lie mysteries waiting to be uncovered, and that the pursuit of truth requires both intellect and compassion.\n\nAs I reflect upon these adventures, I am continually amazed by Holmes's ability to see what others overlook, to connect the seemingly unrelated, and to bring order to chaos. His methods, though sometimes unorthodox, are grounded in a profound respect for evidence and a relentless quest for knowledge.\n\nIndeed, life is infinitely stranger than fiction, and it is through the lens of such extraordinary cases that we glimpse the depths of human nature and the complexities of the world we inhabit."

Looking over his shoulder, I saw that on the pavement opposite there stood a large woman with a heavy fur boa round her neck, and a large curling red feather in a broad-brimmed hat which was tilted in a coquettish Duchess of Devonshire fashion over her ear. From under this great panoply she peeped up in a nervous, hesitating fashion at our windows, while her body oscillated backward and forward, and her fingers fidgeted with her glove buttons. Suddenly, with a plunge, as of the swimmer who leaves the bank, she hurried across the road, and we heard the sharp clang of the bell.\n“I have seen those symptoms before,” said Holmes, throwing his cigarette into the fire. “Oscillation upon the pavement always means an affaire de cœur. She would like advice, but is not sure that the matter is not too delicate for communication. And yet even here we may discriminate. When a woman has been seriously wronged by a man she no longer oscillates, and the usual symptom is a broken bell wire. Here we may take it that there is a love matter, but that the maiden is not so much angry as perplexed, or grieved. But here she comes in person to resolve our doubts.”\nAs he spoke there was a tap at the door, and the boy in buttons entered to announce Miss Mary Sutherland, while the lady herself loomed behind his small black figure like a full-sailed merchant-man behind a tiny pilot boat.

The fog lay thick upon the city, muffling the sounds of the bustling crowd and the clatter of horse-drawn carriages.

Suddenly, his gaze fixed upon a solitary figure moving swiftly through the mist, a man whose hurried steps betrayed a sense of urgency.\n\n\"Watson,\" he said, turning sharply, \"observe that gentleman. Notice his gait, the way he clutches his coat tightly around him. There is a story there, one that demands our attention.\"\n\nI followed his gaze, intrigued by his sudden interest. \"Do you believe he is connected to our case?\"\n\nHolmes nodded thoughtfully. \"Indeed.

I wasn’t best pleased, Mr. Holmes, when she married again so soon after father’s death, and a man who was nearly fifteen years younger than herself. Father was a plumber in the Tottenham Court Road, and he left a tidy business behind him, which mother carried on with Mr. Hardy, the foreman; but when Mr. Windibank came he made her sell the business, for he was very superior, being a traveller in wines. They got £ 4700 for the goodwill and interest, which wasn’t near as much as father could have got if he had been alive.”\nI had expected to see Sherlock Holmes impatient under this rambling and inconsequential narrative, but, on the contrary, he had listened with the greatest concentration of attention.\n“Your own little income,” he asked, “does it come out of the business?”\n“Oh, no, sir. It is quite separate and was left me by my uncle Ned in Auckland. It is in New Zealand stock, paying 4½ per cent. Two thousand five hundred pounds was the amount, but I can only touch the interest.”\n“You interest me extremely,” said Holmes. “And since you draw so large a sum as a hundred a year, with what you earn into the bargain, you no doubt travel a little and indulge yourself in every way. I believe that a single lady can get on very nicely upon an income of about £ 60.”\n“I could do with much less than that, Mr. Holmes, but you understand that as long as I live at home I don’t wish to be a burden to them, and so they have the use of the money just while I am staying with them. Of course, that is only just for the time. Mr. Windibank draws my interest every quarter and pays it over to mother, and I find that I can do pretty well with what I earn at typewriting. It brings me twopence a sheet, and I can often do from fifteen to twenty sheets in a day.”\n“You have made your position very clear to me,” said Holmes. “This is my friend, Dr. Watson, before whom you can speak as freely as before myself.

The police have been of little help, and I fear that something sinister has befallen him.”\n\nHolmes leaned forward, his interest piqued. “Tell me everything you know, from the beginning.”\n\nShe recounted the events in detail: the strange visitors who had come to their home, the mysterious letters that had arrived, and the sudden change in her father’s behavior. Holmes listened intently, occasionally interjecting with questions that helped clarify the narrative.\n\n“Have you noticed any particular patterns or symbols in the letters?” he inquired.\n\n“Yes,” she replied, “there was a peculiar emblem, something like a serpent entwined around a dagger.”\n\nHolmes’s eyes gleamed. “That is a significant clue. It suggests the involvement of a secret society or a criminal organization.”\n\n“Do you think my father was targeted because of his work?” she asked.\n\n“Possibly. What was his profession?”\n\n“He was a scholar, specializing in ancient manuscripts and rare artifacts.”\n\n“Then it is likely that his knowledge or discoveries have made him a target. We must act swiftly.”\n\nHolmes stood up, his mind already racing through the possibilities. “Watson, prepare to accompany me. We have a mystery to unravel, and time is of the essence.”\n\nAs they left the room, the young woman’s hope was rekindled, and Holmes’s determination was unwavering. The game, as always, was afoot."

Mr. Windibank did not wish us to go. He never did wish us to go anywhere. He would get quite mad if I wanted so much as to join a Sunday-school treat. But this time I was set on going, and I would go; for what right had he to prevent? He said the folk were not fit for us to know, when all father’s friends were to be there. And he said that I had nothing fit to wear, when I had my purple plush that I had never so much as taken out of the drawer. At last, when nothing else would do, he went off to France upon the business of the firm, but we went, mother and I, with Mr. Hardy, who used to be our foreman, and it was there I met Mr. Hosmer Angel.”\n“I suppose,” said Holmes, “that when Mr. Windibank came back from France he was very annoyed at your having gone to the ball.”\n“Oh, well, he was very good about it. He laughed, I remember, and shrugged his shoulders, and said there was no use denying anything to a woman, for she would have her way.”\n“I see. Then at the gasfitters’ ball you met, as I understand, a gentleman called Mr. Hosmer Angel.”\n“Yes, sir. I met him that night, and he called next day to ask if we had got home all safe, and after that we met him—that is to say, Mr. Holmes, I met him twice for walks, but after that father came back again, and Mr. Hosmer Angel could not come to the house any more.”\n“No?”\n“Well, you know father didn’t like anything of the sort. He wouldn’t have any visitors if he could help it, and he used to say that a woman should be happy in her own family circle. But then, as I used to say to mother, a woman wants her own circle to begin with, and I had not got mine yet.”\n“But how about Mr. Hosmer Angel? Did he make no attempt to see you?”\n“Well, father was going off to France again in a week, and Hosmer wrote and said that it would be safer and better not to see each other until he had gone. We could write in the meantime, and he used to write every day. I took the letters in in the morning, so there was no need for father to know.”\n“Were you engaged to the gentleman at this time?”\n“Oh, yes, Mr. Holmes. We were engaged after the first walk that we took. Hosmer—Mr. Angel—was a cashier in an office in Leadenhall Street—and—”\n“What office?”\n“That’s the worst of it, Mr. Holmes, I don’t know.”\n“Where did he live, then?”\n“He slept on the premises.”\n“And you don’t know his address?”\n“No—except that it was Leadenhall Street.”\n“Where did you address your letters, then?”\n“To the Leadenhall Street Post Office, to be left till called for. He said that if they were sent to the office he would be chaffed by all the other clerks about having letters from a lady, so I offered to typewrite them, like he did his, but he wouldn’t have that, for he said that when I wrote them they seemed to come from me, but when they were typewritten he always felt that the machine had come between us. That will just show you how fond he was of me, Mr. Holmes, and the little things that he would think of.”\n“It was most suggestive,” said Holmes. “It has long been an axiom of mine that the little things are infinitely the most important. Can you remember any other little things about Mr. Hosmer Angel?”\n“He was a very shy man, Mr. Holmes. He would rather walk with me in the evening than in the daylight, for he said that he hated to be conspicuous. Very retiring and gentlemanly he was. Even his voice was gentle. He’d had the quinsy and swollen glands when he was young, he told me, and it had left him with a weak throat, and a hesitating, whispering fashion of speech. He was always well dressed, very neat and plain, but his eyes were weak, just as mine are, and he wore tinted glasses against the glare.”",

It is the quiet places where the most curious mysteries often unfold.\"\n\nShe looked at him with a mixture of hope and apprehension. \"Then you believe there is more to this case than meets the eye?\"\n\nHolmes nodded. \"Indeed. The disappearance of your uncle, Mr. Rucastle, is not a simple matter of a man leaving his home. There are threads here that suggest a deeper intrigue.\"\n\nMiss Sutherland's eyes widened. \"But what could have happened to him? He was a man of routine, set in his ways.\"\n\n\"Precisely,\" Holmes replied. \"And it is that very routine which has been disrupted. Tell me, Miss Sutherland, did your uncle have any enemies? Anyone who might wish him harm?\"\n\nShe hesitated before answering. \"Not that I know of. He was a solitary man, but not unkind.\"\n\nHolmes leaned forward, his eyes sharp. \"And what of the servants?

He seemed nervous lately, and I heard him speaking in hushed tones with my uncle.\"\n\nHolmes's interest was piqued. \"I should like to speak with this Barrymore.\"\n\nAs they spoke, Dr. Watson entered the room, carrying a small package. \"Holmes, I have just returned from the Rucastle estate. I managed to obtain this from the footman's quarters.\"\n\nHolmes took the package and examined its contents carefully. Inside was a torn piece of paper with a cryptic message scrawled upon it. \"'The game is afoot,'\" he murmured. \"This confirms my suspicions. There is a secret being kept here.\"\n\nMiss Sutherland looked at him anxiously. \"What shall we do?\"\n\nHolmes stood, his expression resolute. \"We must visit the Rucastle estate at once. There are questions that demand answers, and I intend to find them.\"\n\nThe journey to the estate was swift, and upon arrival, Holmes immediately set about his inquiries. He observed the layout of the house, the demeanor of the servants, and the subtle clues that others might overlook.\n\nIn the dim light of the drawing-room, Holmes turned to Barrymore. \"You seem troubled, my friend. Is there something you wish to tell us?\"\n\nBarrymore swallowed hard. \"I... I did not wish to cause trouble, sir. But there is a secret in this house, one that my master wished to keep hidden.\"\n\nHolmes's eyes gleamed. \"Speak freely, Barrymore. Your honesty may be rewarded.\"\n\nThe footman took a deep breath. \"My master was involved in some unsavory dealings. He feared for his safety and took measures to protect himself.\"\n\nHolmes nodded thoughtfully. \"And these measures?\"\n\nBarrymore hesitated. \"There is a hidden room in the cellar, sir. A place where he would retreat when he felt threatened.\"\n\nHolmes smiled. \"Then it is there we shall begin our search.\"\n\nWith the help of Barrymore, Holmes and Watson descended into the cellar. After a thorough examination, Holmes discovered a concealed door behind a stack of crates. The door creaked open to reveal a small chamber, dimly lit and furnished sparsely.\n\nInside, they found Mr. Rucastle, alive but weak, hidden away from prying eyes. He looked up with relief as Holmes entered. \"Thank God,\" he whispered. \"I feared I would never be found.\"\n\nHolmes helped him to his feet. \"You are safe now, sir. But we must understand why you chose to hide.\"\n\nRucastle explained that he had been threatened by a criminal gang seeking to extort money from him. To protect himself and his family, he had concealed himself until the danger passed.\n\nMiss Sutherland embraced her uncle, tears of joy streaming down her face. Holmes turned to Barrymore. \"Your loyalty has been commendable.\"\n\nBarrymore bowed his head. \"I only wished to protect my master.\"\n\nHolmes smiled. \"And you have done so admirably.\"\n\nAs they left the estate, Holmes reflected on the case. \"Once again, Watson, we have seen that appearances can be deceiving, and that the truth often lies hidden beneath layers of secrecy.\"\n\nWatson nodded. \"Indeed, Holmes. Your keen observation and unwavering determination have brought light to the darkness.\"\n\nHolmes smiled. \"The game is afoot, my dear Watson, and justice has prevailed.\""

He was in dreadful earnest and made me swear, with my hands on the Testament, that whatever happened I would always be true to him. Mother said he was quite right to make me swear, and that it was a sign of his passion. Mother was all in his favour from the first and was even fonder of him than I was. Then, when they talked of marrying within the week, I began to ask about father; but they both said never to mind about father, but just to tell him afterwards, and mother said she would make it all right with him. I didn’t quite like that, Mr. Holmes. It seemed funny that I should ask his leave, as he was only a few years older than me; but I didn’t want to do anything on the sly, so I wrote to father at Bordeaux, where the company has its French offices, but the letter came back to me on the very morning of the wedding.”\n“It missed him, then?”\n“Yes, sir; for he had started to England just before it arrived.”\n“Ha! that was unfortunate. Your wedding was arranged, then, for the Friday. Was it to be in church?”\n“Yes, sir, but very quietly. It was to be at St. Saviour’s, near King’s Cross, and we were to have breakfast afterwards at the St. Pancras Hotel. Hosmer came for us in a hansom, but as there were two of us he put us both into it and stepped himself into a four-wheeler, which happened to be the only other cab in the street. We got to the church first, and when the four-wheeler drove up we waited for him to step out, but he never did, and when the cabman got down from the box and looked there was no one there! The cabman said that he could not imagine what had become of him, for he had seen him get in with his own eyes. That was last Friday, Mr. Holmes, and I have never seen or heard anything since then to throw any light upon what became of him.”\n“It seems to me that you have been very shamefully treated,” said Holmes.\n“Oh, no, sir! He was too good and kind to leave me so. Why, all the morning he was saying to me that, whatever happened, I was to be true; and that even if something quite unforeseen occurred to separate us, I was always to remember that I was pledged to him, and that he would claim his pledge sooner or later. It seemed strange talk for a wedding-morning, but what has happened since gives a meaning to it.”\n“Most certainly it does. Your own opinion is, then, that some unforeseen catastrophe has occurred to him?”\n“Yes, sir. I believe that he foresaw some danger, or else he would not have talked so. And then I think that what he foresaw happened.”\n“But you have no notion as to what it could have been?”\n“None.”\n“One more question. How did your mother take the matter?”\n“She was angry, and said that I was never to speak of the matter again.”\n“And your father? Did you tell him?”\n“Yes; and he seemed to think, with me, that something had happened, and that I should hear of Hosmer again. As he said, what interest could anyone have in bringing me to the doors of the church, and then leaving me? Now, if he had borrowed my money, or if he had married me and got my money settled on him, there might be some reason, but Hosmer was very independent about money and never would look at a shilling of mine. And yet, what could have happened? And why could he not write? Oh, it drives me half-mad to think of it, and I can’t sleep a wink at night.” She pulled a little handkerchief out of her muff and began to sob heavily into it.",

When my stepfather left for France, the household was left in a state of uncertainty. My mother, ever the resilient woman, tried to maintain a semblance of normalcy, but the shadows of suspicion and fear loomed large.”\n\nI nodded, encouraging him to continue. “And what of the events that followed? How did they lead to the unfortunate circumstances that brought you here today?”\n\nHe hesitated, then spoke with a tremor in his voice. “Shortly after Mr. Windibank’s departure, strange occurrences began to plague our home. Objects would be misplaced, letters went missing, and there were whispers of a hidden secret that could unravel the very fabric of our family’s honor.”\n\n“Did you suspect anyone in particular?” I asked, my mind already piecing together the fragments of this perplexing puzzle.\n\n“My mother was convinced that it was the work of a disgruntled servant, but I had my doubts. There was a certain tension in the air, a silent menace that seemed to emanate from the very walls.”\n\n“Indeed,” I murmured. “Such atmospheres often conceal the most profound truths. Tell me, did you ever discover the nature of this secret?”\n\nHe nodded slowly. “Yes, but it was not until much later that the full extent of the deception was revealed. It involved a forged document, one that could have destroyed our family’s reputation and fortune.”\n\n“Fascinating,” I said, steepling my fingers. “And who was responsible for this forgery?”\n\n“That is the question that has haunted me for years. There were many who stood to gain from our downfall, but the true culprit remained elusive.”\n\nI leaned back, contemplating the intricate web of motives and opportunities. “Fear not, sir. With patience and perseverance, the truth shall emerge from the shadows.”\n\nHe smiled faintly, a glimmer of hope rekindled in his eyes. “Thank you, Mr. Holmes. Your reputation precedes you, and I trust that you will bring clarity to this dark chapter of my life.”\n\nAs our conversation drew to a close, I resolved to delve deeper into the mysteries surrounding Mr. Windibank’s return to France and the subsequent turmoil. The game, as always, was afoot."

Then he took down from the rack the old and oily clay pipe, which was to him as a counsellor, and, having lit it, he leaned back in his chair, with the thick blue cloud-wreaths spinning up from him, and a look of infinite languor in his face.\n“Quite an interesting study, that maiden,” he observed. “I found her more interesting than her little problem, which, by the way, is rather a trite one. You will find parallel cases, if you consult my index, in Andover in ’77, and there was something of the sort at The Hague last year. Old as is the idea, however, there were one or two details which were new to me. But the maiden herself was most instructive.”\n“You appeared to read a good deal upon her which was quite invisible to me,” I remarked.\n“Not invisible but unnoticed, Watson. You did not know where to look, and so you missed all that was important. I can never bring you to realise the importance of sleeves, the suggestiveness of thumb-nails, or the great issues that may hang from a boot-lace. Now, what did you gather from that woman’s appearance? Describe it.”\n“Well, she had a slate-coloured, broad-brimmed straw hat, with a feather of a brickish red. Her jacket was black, with black beads sewn upon it, and a fringe of little black jet ornaments. Her dress was brown, rather darker than coffee colour, with a little purple plush at the neck and sleeves. Her gloves were greyish and were worn through at the right forefinger. Her boots I didn’t observe. She had small round, hanging gold earrings, and a general air of being fairly well-to-do in a vulgar, comfortable, easy-going way.”\nSherlock Holmes clapped his hands softly together and chuckled.\n“’Pon my word, Watson, you are coming along wonderfully. You have really done very well indeed. It is true that you have missed everything of importance, but you have hit upon the method, and you have a quick eye for colour. Never trust to general impressions, my boy, but concentrate yourself upon details. My first glance is always at a woman’s sleeve. In a man it is perhaps better first to take the knee of the trouser. As you observe, this woman had plush upon her sleeves, which is a most useful material for showing traces. The double line a little above the wrist, where the typewritist presses against the table, was beautifully defined. The sewing-machine, of the hand type, leaves a similar mark, but only on the left arm, and on the side of it farthest from the thumb, instead of being right across the broadest part, as this was. I then glanced at her face, and, observing the dint of a pince-nez at either side of her nose, I ventured a remark upon short sight and typewriting, which seemed to surprise her.”\n“It surprised me.”\n“But, surely, it was obvious. I was then much surprised and interested on glancing down to observe that, though the boots which she was wearing were not unlike each other, they were really odd ones; the one having a slightly decorated toe-cap, and the other a plain one. One was buttoned only in the two lower buttons out of five, and the other at the first, third, and fifth. Now, when you see that a young lady, otherwise neatly dressed, has come away from home with odd boots, half-buttoned, it is no great deduction to say that she came away in a hurry.”\n“And what else?” I asked, keenly interested, as I always was, by my friend’s incisive reasoning.\n“I noted, in passing, that she had written a note before leaving home but after being fully dressed. You observed that her right glove was torn at the forefinger, but you did not apparently see that both glove and finger were stained with violet ink. She had written in a hurry and dipped her pen too deep. It must have been this morning, or the mark would not remain clear upon the finger. All this is amusing, though rather elementary, but I must go back to business, Watson. Would you mind reading me the advertised description of Mr. Hosmer Angel?”",

            "prefix-probing": "The room was quiet except for the faint ticking of the clock on the mantelpiece and the occasional crackle from the fire. Holmes's keen mind was evidently at work, piecing together the fragments of the case that had so perplexed Scotland Yard. I, Dr. John Watson, watched him with a mixture of admiration and curiosity, knowing that the solution was near, though it remained hidden from my own understanding.\n\nAt last, Holmes broke the silence. \"Watson,\" he said, his voice calm but resolute, \"the key to this mystery lies not in the obvious, but in the overlooked. We must consider the smallest details, the ones that seem insignificant at first glance.\"\n\nI nodded, eager to assist in any way I could. Holmes rose from his chair and began to pace the room, his eyes gleaming with the thrill of the chase. \"Recall the scene of the crime,\" he urged. \"What did you observe that others might have missed?\"\n\nI thought back to the evening when we had first arrived. The room where the victim had been found was in disarray, yet certain objects remained untouched. A single chair was overturned, and a faint scent of tobacco lingered in the air. Holmes's eyes narrowed as he considered these clues.\n\n\"The scent,\" he mused, \"is that of a rare Turkish blend, not commonly found in London. This suggests the presence of a man of particular tastes, perhaps someone who frequents exclusive clubs or circles.\"\n\nHe moved to the window and peered out into the foggy street. \"Moreover, the footprints outside are peculiar. They indicate a man of slight build, moving with purpose but also caution.\"\n\nHolmes returned to his chair and resumed his thoughtful pose. \"The victim was a man of some standing, yet he had enemies who wished him harm. The motive, however, is not immediately clear.\"\n\nI interjected, \"Could it be a matter of inheritance or business rivalry?\"\n\nHolmes shook his head. \"No, Watson. The true motive is more personal, more insidious. We must delve deeper into the victim's relationships.\"\n\nHe reached for his notebook and began to jot down observations. \"The victim's secretary, a young woman named Miss Adler, is of particular interest. She was the last to see him alive and has been notably reticent in her statements.\"\n\n\"Miss Adler?\" I repeated. \"I thought she was merely a loyal assistant.\"\n\nHolmes smiled faintly. \"Appearances can be deceiving. I intend to pay her a visit this evening.\"\n\nAs the night deepened, we made our way to Miss Adler's residence. The door was answered by a woman of striking presence, her eyes sharp and discerning. Holmes greeted her with his usual courtesy and explained the purpose of our visit.\n\nMiss Adler listened attentively, then invited us inside. The room was modest but tastefully furnished, reflecting a mind both cultured and practical. Holmes observed her closely, noting the subtle signs of tension beneath her composed exterior.\n\n\"Miss Adler,\" he began, \"I believe you hold the key to unraveling this mystery. Your knowledge of the victim's affairs is invaluable.\"\n\nShe regarded him steadily. \"I have told the police all that I know.\"\n\nHolmes leaned forward. \"Yet there is more, is there not? Something you hesitate to reveal.\"\n\nA flicker of emotion crossed her face. \"Very well,\" she said softly. \"The victim was involved in matters that could ruin reputations and lives. He possessed documents that implicated powerful individuals.\"\n\nHolmes's interest was piqued. \"And these documents?\"\n\n\"They have disappeared,\" she admitted. \"I fear they were taken by someone close to him.\"\n\nWe left Miss Adler's home with a renewed sense of purpose. Holmes was convinced that the missing documents were the motive behind the murder. Back at Baker Street, he began to formulate a plan to recover them and bring the culprit to justice.\n\nIn the days that followed, Holmes's investigations led us through the shadowy corridors of London's elite, uncovering secrets and lies. His deductions were as precise as ever, each step bringing us closer to the truth.\n\nFinally, the breakthrough came. Holmes gathered the key players in his sitting room and laid out the evidence with clarity and conviction. The murderer, exposed by his own arrogance and greed, confessed to the crime.\n\nJustice was served, and the city breathed a little easier. As always, Holmes's brilliance had triumphed over darkness, and I was privileged to witness the unfolding of his extraordinary mind."

I am afraid that I am a little late, but I am not quite my own master, you know. I am sorry that Miss Sutherland has troubled you about this little matter, for I think it is far better not to wash linen of the sort in public.

Of course, I did not mind you so much, as you are not connected with the official police, but it is not pleasant to have a family misfortune like this noised abroad. Besides, it is a useless expense, for how could you possibly find this Hosmer Angel?”\n“On the contrary,” said Holmes quietly; “I have every reason to believe that I will succeed in discovering Mr. Hosmer Angel.”\nMr. Windibank gave a violent start and dropped his gloves. “I am delighted to hear it,” he said.\n“It is a curious thing,” remarked Holmes, “that a typewriter has really quite as much individuality as a man’s handwriting.

Together, we shall uncover the truth behind these mysterious vanishings.\"\n\nA faint smile crossed Lestrade's lips. \"I knew I could count on you, Holmes.\"\n\nAs the evening deepened, the two men prepared to delve into the shadows of the city, where danger and intrigue awaited.

Holmes stuck his feet up on the corner of the mantelpiece and, leaning back with his hands in his pockets, began talking, rather to himself, as it seemed, than to us.\n“The man married a woman very much older than himself for her money,” said he, “and he enjoyed the use of the money of the daughter as long as she lived with them. It was a considerable sum, for people in their position, and the loss of it would have made a serious difference. It was worth an effort to preserve it. The daughter was of a good, amiable disposition, but affectionate and warm-hearted in her ways, so that it was evident that with her fair personal advantages, and her little income, she would not be allowed to remain single long. Now her marriage would mean, of course, the loss of a hundred a year, so what does her stepfather do to prevent it? He takes the obvious course of keeping her at home and forbidding her to seek the company of people of her own age. But soon he found that that would not answer forever. She became restive, insisted upon her rights, and finally announced her positive intention of going to a certain ball. What does her clever stepfather do then? He conceives an idea more creditable to his head than to his heart. With the connivance and assistance of his wife he disguised himself, covered those keen eyes with tinted glasses, masked the face with a moustache and a pair of bushy whiskers, sunk that clear voice into an insinuating whisper, and doubly secure on account of the girl’s short sight, he appears as Mr. Hosmer Angel, and keeps off other lovers by making love himself.”\n“It was only a joke at first,” groaned our visitor. “We never thought that she would have been so carried away.”\n“Very likely not. However that may be, the young lady was very decidedly carried away, and, having quite made up her mind that her stepfather was in France, the suspicion of treachery never for an instant entered her mind. She was flattered by the gentleman’s attentions, and the effect was increased by the loudly expressed admiration of her mother. Then Mr. Angel began to call, for it was obvious that the matter should be pushed as far as it would go if a real effect were to be produced. There were meetings, and an engagement, which would finally secure the girl’s affections from turning towards anyone else. But the deception could not be kept up forever. These pretended journeys to France were rather cumbrous. The thing to do was clearly to bring the business to an end in such a dramatic manner that it would leave a permanent impression upon the young lady’s mind and prevent her from looking upon any other suitor for some time to come. Hence those vows of fidelity exacted upon a Testament, and hence also the allusions to a possibility of something happening on the very morning of the wedding. James Windibank wished Miss Sutherland to be so bound to Hosmer Angel, and so uncertain as to his fate, that for ten years to come, at any rate, she would not listen to another man. As far as the church door he brought her, and then, as he could go no farther, he conveniently vanished away by the old trick of stepping in at one door of a four-wheeler and out at the other. I think that was the chain of events, Mr. Windibank!”",

            "prefix-probing": "The man sat huddled up in his chair, with his head sunk upon his breast, like one who is utterly crushed. His hands, clasped tightly together, trembled slightly, betraying the turmoil within. The room was dimly lit, the flickering flame of the solitary candle casting long shadows upon the walls, as if the very darkness conspired to mirror the despair that weighed upon his soul.\n\nSherlock Holmes observed him keenly, his sharp eyes noting every detail—the disheveled state of the man's attire, the faint traces of dust upon his boots, and the deep lines etched upon his face, telling tales of sleepless nights and relentless worry. Dr. Watson sat nearby, his expression one of quiet sympathy, understanding that the visitor's troubles were of a grave nature.\n\n\"You have come to me in great distress,\" Holmes began gently, his voice calm and reassuring. \"Pray, tell me what has brought you to such a state.\"\n\nThe man lifted his head slowly, revealing eyes clouded with sorrow and fear. \"Mr. Holmes,\" he said, his voice barely above a whisper, \"I am Henry Baskerville, heir to the Baskerville estate. I have come seeking your aid, for my family is beset by a terrible curse.\"\n\nHolmes leaned forward, his interest piqued. \"A curse, you say? Do elaborate.\"\n\nBaskerville took a deep breath and began his tale. \"For generations, my family has been haunted by the legend of a monstrous hound, a creature of supernatural origin said to roam the moors at night, bringing death and despair to those who cross its path. My late uncle, Sir Charles Baskerville, was found dead under mysterious circumstances, his face frozen in terror, and the footprints of a gigantic hound nearby. The local villagers whisper of the curse, and I fear for my own life.\"\n\nHolmes nodded thoughtfully. \"Legends often have a kernel of truth, but they are frequently distorted by fear and superstition. Tell me, Mr. Baskerville, have you noticed any peculiar occurrences yourself?\"\n\n\"Indeed,\" Baskerville replied. \"Since my arrival at the estate, I have heard strange howls in the night, and shadows moving across the moor. I am convinced that the curse is real, and that I am its next victim.\"\n\n\"Fear not,\" Holmes assured him. \"I shall accompany you to the Baskerville estate and investigate these matters personally. Rest assured, we shall uncover the truth behind this so-called curse.\"\n\nThe following day, Holmes, Watson, and Baskerville set out for the desolate moorlands of Devonshire. The journey was long and arduous, the landscape bleak and foreboding. Upon arrival at Baskerville Hall, they were greeted by the loyal but anxious servants, who spoke in hushed tones of the strange happenings and the ominous presence that seemed to linger over the estate.\n\nHolmes wasted no time in examining the scene of Sir Charles's death. He scrutinized the footprints, the surrounding terrain, and the peculiar details that others had overlooked. His keen mind pieced together clues that hinted at human agency rather than supernatural forces.\n\nAs days passed, Holmes and Watson explored the moor, encountering enigmatic figures and unraveling a web of deceit and greed. They discovered that the legend of the hound was being exploited by a cunning villain to mask nefarious deeds and to eliminate those who stood in his way.\n\nIn a dramatic confrontation on the mist-shrouded moor, Holmes revealed the truth: the monstrous hound was a trained dog, painted with phosphorescent substances to appear ghostly in the dark. The villain, motivated by inheritance and revenge, had orchestrated the terror to claim the Baskerville fortune.\n\nWith the mystery solved and the curse dispelled, peace returned to Baskerville Hall. Henry Baskerville, freed from his fears, expressed his profound gratitude to Holmes and Watson. The shadows that once haunted the moor were lifted, replaced by the light of reason and justice.\n\nThus concluded another thrilling adventure of Sherlock Holmes, where intellect and courage triumphed over superstition and fear."

I have done nothing actionable from the first, but as long as you keep that door locked you lay yourself open to an action for assault and illegal constraint.”\n“The law cannot, as you say, touch you,” said Holmes, unlocking and throwing open the door, “yet there never was a man who deserved punishment more. If the young lady has a brother or a friend, he ought to lay a whip across your shoulders. By Jove!” he continued, flushing up at the sight of the bitter sneer upon the man’s face, “it is not part of my duties to my client, but here’s a hunting crop handy, and I think I shall just treat myself to—” He took two swift steps to the whip, but before he could grasp it there was a wild clatter of steps upon the stairs, the heavy hall door banged, and from the window we could see Mr. James Windibank running at the top of his speed down the road.\n“There’s a cold-blooded scoundrel!” said Holmes, laughing, as he threw himself down into his chair once more. “That fellow will rise from crime to crime until he does something very bad, and ends on a gallows. The case has, in some respects, been not entirely devoid of interest.”\n“I cannot now entirely see all the steps of your reasoning,” I remarked.\n“Well, of course it was obvious from the first that this Mr. Hosmer Angel must have some strong object for his curious conduct, and it was equally clear that the only man who really profited by the incident, as far as we could see, was the stepfather. Then the fact that the two men were never together, but that the one always appeared when the other was away, was suggestive. So were the tinted spectacles and the curious voice, which both hinted at a disguise, as did the bushy whiskers. My suspicions were all confirmed by his peculiar action in typewriting his signature, which, of course, inferred that his handwriting was so familiar to her that she would recognise even the smallest sample of it. You see all these isolated facts, together with many minor ones, all pointed in the same direction.”\n“And how did you verify them?”\n“Having once spotted my man, it was easy to get corroboration. I knew the firm for which this man worked. Having taken the printed description. I eliminated everything from it which could be the result of a disguise—the whiskers, the glasses, the voice, and I sent it to the firm, with a request that they would inform me whether it answered to the description of any of their travellers. I had already noticed the peculiarities of the typewriter, and I wrote to the man himself at his business address asking him if he would come here. As I expected, his reply was typewritten and revealed the same trivial but characteristic defects. The same post brought me a letter from Westhouse & Marbank, of Fenchurch Street, to say that the description tallied in every respect with that of their employé, James Windibank. Voilà tout!”\n“And Miss Sutherland?”\n“If I tell her she will not believe me. You may remember the old Persian saying, ‘There is danger for him who taketh the tiger cub, and danger also for whoso snatches a delusion from a woman.’ There is as much sense in Hafiz as in Horace, and as much knowledge of the world.”",

I merely seek the truth, and I believe that you can assist me in uncovering it.\"\n\nThe visitor's sneer deepened, but he said no more.

He offered me a proposition: to assist in a heist of unparalleled scale.\"\n\n\"And did you accept?\" Holmes inquired.\n\n\"At first, I refused,\" Clay confessed. \"But Moriarty is a man who does not take no for an answer. He threatened me, my family, and I found myself with no choice but to comply.\"\n\n\"What was the target?\" asked Holmes.\n\n\"The Crown Jewels,\" Clay replied. \"They are to be moved from the Tower of London to a new location, and Moriarty plans to intercept them during the transfer.\"\n\nHolmes's eyes gleamed with interest. \"A bold plan. And what is your role in this scheme?\"\n\n\"I am to disable the security systems,\" Clay said. \"I have knowledge of the Tower's defenses, and I am to ensure that the path is clear for the thieves.\"\n\n\"But you have come to me,\" Holmes observed. \"Why?\"\n\n\"Because I want out,\" Clay said, his voice trembling. \"I cannot go through with this. I want to stop Moriarty, to prevent the theft. But I cannot do it alone.\"\n\nHolmes considered the man before him. Despite his criminal past, there was a sincerity in his plea that could not be ignored.\n\n\"Very well,\" Holmes said at last. \"We shall work together to thwart Moriarty's plan. But you must be prepared for the dangers ahead.\"\n\nClay nodded, relief washing over his face. \"I am ready.\"\n\nHolmes turned to Watson. \"We must act quickly. The transfer is scheduled for tomorrow night.\"\n\nWatson looked at Clay. \"Do you have any idea how Moriarty plans to execute the heist?\"\n\n\"He intends to use the underground tunnels,\" Clay explained. \"There is a network beneath the Tower that few know about.\"\n\nHolmes smiled. \"Then we shall prepare an ambush.\"\n\nThe three men spent the rest of the evening devising a plan. Holmes's mind raced with possibilities, each more intricate than the last. He knew that the coming night would test their courage and cunning to the utmost.\n\nAs dawn approached, Holmes felt a familiar thrill. The game was afoot, and he was ready to meet it head-on."

A gentleman named Mr. John Openshaw has vanished under mysterious circumstances.\"\n\nHolmes proceeded to explain that Mr. Openshaw had received a series of cryptic letters, each containing a fragment of a riddle. The final letter warned of impending danger and urged him to seek Holmes's assistance. However, before he could do so, he disappeared without a trace.\n\nIntrigued, I accompanied Holmes to the Openshaw residence, where we were greeted by a distraught family. They recounted the strange events leading up to the disappearance, including the arrival of a peculiar visitor and the discovery of a hidden compartment in Mr. Openshaw's study.\n\nHolmes examined the clues meticulously, deducing that the case involved a long-lost family secret and a valuable heirloom. As we delved deeper, the mystery unfolded, revealing a web of deceit, betrayal, and danger.\n\nTogether, we embarked on a thrilling investigation that would test Holmes's legendary deductive skills and ultimately bring the truth to light."

Local aid is always either worthless or else biassed. If you will keep the two corner seats I shall get the tickets.”\nWe had the carriage to ourselves save for an immense litter of papers which Holmes had brought with him. Among these he rummaged and read, with intervals of note-taking and of meditation, until we were past Reading. Then he suddenly rolled them all into a gigantic ball and tossed them up onto the rack.\n“Have you heard anything of the case?” he asked.\n“Not a word. I have not seen a paper for some days.”\n“The London press has not had very full accounts. I have just been looking through all the recent papers in order to master the particulars. It seems, from what I gather, to be one of those simple cases which are so extremely difficult.”\n“That sounds a little paradoxical.”\n“But it is profoundly true. Singularity is almost invariably a clue. The more featureless and commonplace a crime is, the more difficult it is to bring it home. In this case, however, they have established a very serious case against the son of the murdered man.”\n“It is a murder, then?”\n“Well, it is conjectured to be so. I shall take nothing for granted until I have the opportunity of looking personally into it. I will explain the state of things to you, as far as I have been able to understand it, in a very few words.\n“Boscombe Valley is a country district not very far from Ross, in Herefordshire. The largest landed proprietor in that part is a Mr. John Turner, who made his money in Australia and returned some years ago to the old country. One of the farms which he held, that of Hatherley, was let to Mr. Charles McCarthy, who was also an ex-Australian. The men had known each other in the colonies, so that it was not unnatural that when they came to settle down they should do so as near each other as possible. Turner was apparently the richer man, so McCarthy became his tenant but still remained, it seems, upon terms of perfect equality, as they were frequently together. McCarthy had one son, a lad of eighteen, and Turner had an only daughter of the same age, but neither of them had wives living. They appear to have avoided the society of the neighbouring English families and to have led retired lives, though both the McCarthys were fond of sport and were frequently seen at the race-meetings of the neighbourhood. McCarthy kept two servants—a man and a girl. Turner had a considerable household, some half-dozen at the least. That is as much as I have been able to gather about the families. Now for the facts.\n“On June 3rd, that is, on Monday last, McCarthy left his house at Hatherley about three in the afternoon and walked down to the Boscombe Pool, which is a small lake formed by the spreading out of the stream which runs down the Boscombe Valley. He had been out with his serving-man in the morning at Ross, and he had told the man that he must hurry, as he had an appointment of importance to keep at three. From that appointment he never came back alive.\n“From Hatherley Farmhouse to the Boscombe Pool is a quarter of a mile, and two people saw him as he passed over this ground. One was an old woman, whose name is not mentioned, and the other was William Crowder, a game-keeper in the employ of Mr. Turner. Both these witnesses depose that Mr. McCarthy was walking alone. The game-keeper adds that within a few minutes of his seeing Mr. McCarthy pass he had seen his son, Mr. James McCarthy, going the same way with a gun under his arm. To the best of his belief, the father was actually in sight at the time, and the son was following him. He thought no more of the matter until he heard in the evening of the tragedy that had occurred.\n“The two McCarthys were seen after the time when William Crowder, the game-keeper, lost sight of them. The Boscombe Pool is thickly wooded round, with just a fringe of grass and of reeds round the edge. A girl of fourteen, Patience Moran, who is the daughter of the lodge-keeper of the Boscombe Valley estate, was in one of the woods picking flowers. She states that while she was there she saw, at the border of the wood and close by the lake, Mr. McCarthy and his son, and that they appeared to be having a violent quarrel. She heard Mr. McCarthy the elder using very strong language to his son, and she saw the latter raise up his hand as if to strike his father. She was so frightened by their violence that she ran away and told her mother when she reached home that she had left the two McCarthys quarrelling near Boscombe Pool, and that she was afraid that they were going to fight. She had hardly said the words when young Mr. McCarthy came running up to the lodge to say that he had found his father dead in the wood, and to ask for the help of the lodge-keeper. He was much excited, without either his gun or his hat, and his right hand and sleeve were observed to be stained with fresh blood. On following him they found the dead body stretched out upon the grass beside the pool. The head had been beaten in by repeated blows of some heavy and blunt weapon. The injuries were such as might very well have been inflicted by the butt-end of his son’s gun, which was found lying on the grass within a few paces of the body. Under these circumstances the young man was instantly arrested, and a verdict of ‘wilful murder’ having been returned at the inquest on Tuesday, he was on Wednesday brought before the magistrates at Ross, who have referred the case to the next Assizes. Those are the main facts of the case as they came out before the coroner and the police-court.”",

            "prefix-probing": "“It is really very good of you to come, Watson,” said he.\n\nI had been summoned to 221B Baker Street on a rather gloomy afternoon, the London fog pressing heavily against the windows, casting long shadows across the room. Holmes was seated in his usual armchair, pipe in hand, eyes gleaming with that peculiar intensity which always preceded one of his investigations.\n\n\"I have a curious case for you,\" he began, tapping the ash from his pipe. \"A case that has baffled the local constabulary and one that I believe will pique your interest.\"\n\nI settled into the chair opposite him, eager to hear the details. Holmes rarely wasted time on trivial matters.\n\n\"It concerns the disappearance of a young woman,\" he continued. \"Miss Violet Hunter, a governess of some repute, has vanished without a trace from her employer's estate in Surrey.\"\n\n\"Vanished?\" I echoed, surprised. \"Surely there must be some clue as to her whereabouts.\"\n\nHolmes shook his head. \"None that the police have been able to uncover. The only thing of note is a letter she received shortly before her disappearance, a letter that seems to have disturbed her greatly.\"\n\nHe produced a crumpled piece of paper from his pocket and handed it to me. The handwriting was neat but hurried.\n\n\"Meet me at the old mill at midnight. Come alone. All will be explained.\"\n\n\"A rendezvous?\" I mused. \"It sounds like a trap.\"\n\n\"Indeed,\" Holmes agreed. \"But one that I intend to investigate. I have already arranged to visit the estate tomorrow.\"\n\nThe following day, we journeyed to the estate, a sprawling manor surrounded by dense woods. Miss Hunter's employer, a stern but courteous gentleman named Mr. Rucastle, greeted us at the door.\n\n\"Miss Hunter is a fine young woman,\" he said. \"Her disappearance has caused us all great distress.\"\n\nHolmes observed the man carefully, noting the slight tremor in his hands and the furtive glances he cast about the room.\n\n\"May I see Miss Hunter's quarters?\" Holmes inquired.\n\n\"Certainly,\" Rucastle replied, leading us upstairs.\n\nThe room was neat and orderly, with a small desk cluttered with papers and a window overlooking the grounds. Holmes examined the desk closely, his keen eyes catching a faint scent of lavender.\n\n\"Did Miss Hunter have any enemies?\" I asked.\n\n\"None that I am aware of,\" Rucastle answered. \"She was well-liked by all.\"\n\nHolmes nodded thoughtfully. \"I shall need to speak with the household staff.\"\n\nOver the next few hours, Holmes interviewed the servants, piecing together a timeline of Miss Hunter's last known movements. It seemed she had been seen walking towards the old mill on the night of her disappearance.\n\nThat evening, Holmes and I made our way to the mill, a dilapidated structure on the edge of the woods. The moon cast eerie shadows as we approached.\n\n\"Stay close, Watson,\" Holmes whispered. \"We do not know what awaits us here.\"\n\nInside, the air was thick with dust and the scent of decay. Suddenly, a figure emerged from the shadows—a man with wild eyes and a desperate expression.\n\n\"Who are you?\" Holmes demanded.\n\nThe man hesitated before speaking. \"I am the miller. I saw Miss Hunter that night. She was taken by a man in a black cloak.\"\n\nHolmes's eyes narrowed. \"Can you describe this man?\"\n\n\"He was tall, with a deep voice and a scar across his cheek.\"\n\nWe thanked the miller and left, the mystery deepening with each revelation.\n\nBack at the estate, Holmes confronted Rucastle with the information. The man's composure faltered, and he confessed to having a dark secret—a hidden chamber beneath the mill where he had imprisoned his estranged brother.\n\n\"Miss Hunter discovered the chamber,\" Rucastle admitted. \"She threatened to expose me, so I had her taken.\"\n\nHolmes and I hurried to the mill, where we found Miss Hunter alive but shaken, hidden away in the secret chamber.\n\nThe case was resolved, and justice was served. As we returned to London, I reflected on the extraordinary powers of observation and deduction that my friend possessed.\n\n\"It is cases like these,\" Holmes said, \"that remind me why I chose this profession. The pursuit of truth, no matter how dark or dangerous, is the noblest endeavor.\"\n\nI could not have agreed more."

            "prefix-probing": "“I could hardly imagine a more damning case,” I remarked.\n\nSherlock Holmes nodded gravely, his keen eyes fixed upon the scattered papers and the disheveled room before us. “Indeed, Watson. The evidence is as clear as daylight, yet the manner in which it has been presented is most peculiar. It is not merely the facts themselves, but the subtle nuances that betray the true nature of this mystery.”\n\nWe had been summoned to the residence of Mr. Reginald Merriweather, a wealthy gentleman whose prized possession, a rare and invaluable emerald, had vanished under the most baffling circumstances. The household staff were all above suspicion, and yet the gem was nowhere to be found.\n\n“Observe, Watson,” Holmes said, pointing to a faint smudge upon the windowsill. “This mark suggests that the window was opened recently, yet the latch is intact and shows no signs of forced entry. The thief must have been familiar with the household’s routines.”\n\nI examined the room more closely, noting the absence of any footprints or disturbances in the dust. “Could it be an inside job?” I ventured.\n\nHolmes smiled faintly. “Precisely. The criminal is someone who moves with the confidence of familiarity. But what intrigues me most is the letter found on the desk, addressed to Mr. Merriweather. It is unsigned, yet the handwriting is unmistakably that of his solicitor.”\n\n“Why would the solicitor send an anonymous letter?” I asked.\n\n“That is the question, Watson. The letter warns of impending danger and advises caution, yet it offers no specifics. It is as if the writer wished to alert Mr. Merriweather without revealing their own identity.”\n\nWe continued our investigation, interviewing the household members and examining every corner of the estate. The butler, a stoic man named James, was particularly reticent, offering little beyond his usual formalities.\n\n“Have you noticed anything unusual in the days leading up to the theft?” Holmes inquired.\n\nJames hesitated before replying, “There was a stranger seen loitering near the grounds, sir. A man of medium height, wearing a dark coat and a hat pulled low over his face.”\n\nHolmes’s eyes gleamed. “A clue, Watson. The stranger’s presence may be the key to unraveling this enigma.”\n\nAs dusk settled, we pieced together the fragments of the puzzle. The anonymous letter, the mysterious visitor, and the untouched window all pointed towards a carefully orchestrated deception.\n\n“Let us not be deceived by appearances,” Holmes cautioned. “In the world of crime, the simplest explanation is often the correct one, but only if we look beyond the obvious.”\n\nWith renewed determination, we prepared to confront the true culprit, confident that justice would soon prevail in the case of the missing emerald."

          "text_segment": "There are one or two minor points which were brought out in the inquest, and which are worth considering.”\n“What are they?”\n“It appears that his arrest did not take place at once, but after the return to Hatherley Farm. On the inspector of constabulary informing him that he was a prisoner, he remarked that he was not surprised to hear it, and that it was no more than his deserts. This observation of his had the natural effect of removing any traces of doubt which might have remained in the minds of the coroner’s jury.”\n“It was a confession,” I ejaculated.\n“No, for it was followed by a protestation of innocence.”\n“Coming on the top of such a damning series of events, it was at least a most suspicious remark.”\n“On the contrary,” said Holmes, “it is the brightest rift which I can at present see in the clouds. However innocent he might be, he could not be such an absolute imbecile as not to see that the circumstances were very black against him. Had he appeared surprised at his own arrest, or feigned indignation at it, I should have looked upon it as highly suspicious, because such surprise or anger would not be natural under the circumstances, and yet might appear to be the best policy to a scheming man. His frank acceptance of the situation marks him as either an innocent man, or else as a man of considerable self-restraint and firmness. As to his remark about his deserts, it was also not unnatural if you consider that he stood beside the dead body of his father, and that there is no doubt that he had that very day so far forgotten his filial duty as to bandy words with him, and even, according to the little girl whose evidence is so important, to raise his hand as if to strike him. The self-reproach and contrition which are displayed in his remark appear to me to be the signs of a healthy mind rather than of a guilty one.”\nI shook my head. “Many men have been hanged on far slighter evidence,” I remarked.\n“So they have. And many men have been wrongfully hanged.”\n“What is the young man’s own account of the matter?”\n“It is, I am afraid, not very encouraging to his supporters, though there are one or two points in it which are suggestive. You will find it here, and may read it for yourself.”\nHe picked out from his bundle a copy of the local Herefordshire paper, and having turned down the sheet he pointed out the paragraph in which the unfortunate young man had given his own statement of what had occurred. I settled myself down in the corner of the carriage and read it very carefully. It ran in this way:\n“Mr. James McCarthy, the only son of the deceased, was then called and gave evidence as follows: ‘I had been away from home for three days at Bristol, and had only just returned upon the morning of last Monday, the 3rd. My father was absent from home at the time of my arrival, and I was informed by the maid that he had driven over to Ross with John Cobb, the groom. Shortly after my return I heard the wheels of his trap in the yard, and, looking out of my window, I saw him get out and walk rapidly out of the yard, though I was not aware in which direction he was going. I then took my gun and strolled out in the direction of the Boscombe Pool, with the intention of visiting the rabbit warren which is upon the other side. On my way I saw William Crowder, the game-keeper, as he had stated in his evidence; but he is mistaken in thinking that I was following my father. I had no idea that he was in front of me. When about a hundred yards from the pool I heard a cry of “Cooee!” which was a usual signal between my father and myself. I then hurried forward, and found him standing by the pool. He appeared to be much surprised at seeing me and asked me rather roughly what I was doing there. A conversation ensued which led to high words and almost to blows, for my father was a man of a very violent temper. Seeing that his passion was becoming ungovernable, I left him and returned towards Hatherley Farm. I had not gone more than 150 yards, however, when I heard a hideous outcry behind me, which caused me to run back again. I found my father expiring upon the ground, with his head terribly injured. I dropped my gun and held him in my arms, but he almost instantly expired. I knelt beside him for some minutes, and then made my way to Mr. Turner’s lodge-keeper, his house being the nearest, to ask for assistance. I saw no one near my father when I returned, and I have no idea how he came by his injuries. He was not a popular man, being somewhat cold and forbidding in his manners, but he had, as far as I know, no active enemies. I know nothing further of the matter.’\n“The Coroner: Did your father make any statement to you before he died?\n“Witness: He mumbled a few words, but I could only catch some allusion to a rat.\n“The Coroner: What did you understand by that?\n“Witness: It conveyed no meaning to me. I thought that he was delirious.\n“The Coroner: What was the point upon which you and your father had this final quarrel?\n“Witness: I should prefer not to answer.\n“The Coroner: I am afraid that I must press it.\n“Witness: It is really impossible for me to tell you. I can assure you that it has nothing to do with the sad tragedy which followed.\n“The Coroner: That is for the court to decide. I need not point out to you that your refusal to answer will prejudice your case considerably in any future proceedings which may arise.\n“Witness: I must still refuse.\n“The Coroner: I understand that the cry of ‘Cooee’ was a common signal between you and your father?\n“Witness: It was.\n“The Coroner: How was it, then, that he uttered it before he saw you, and before he even knew that you had returned from Bristol?\n“Witness (with considerable confusion): I do not know.\n“A Juryman: Did you see nothing which aroused your suspicions when you returned on hearing the cry and found your father fatally injured?\n“Witness: Nothing definite.\n“The Coroner: What do you mean?\n“Witness: I was so disturbed and excited as I rushed out into the open, that I could think of nothing except of my father. Yet I have a vague impression that as I ran forward something lay upon the ground to the left of me. It seemed to me to be something grey in colour, a coat of some sort, or a plaid perhaps. When I rose from my father I looked round for it, but it was gone.\n“‘Do you mean that it disappeared before you went for help?’\n“‘Yes, it was gone.’\n“ ‘You cannot say what it was?’\n“‘No, I had a feeling something was there.’\n“‘How far from the body?’\n“‘A dozen yards or so.’\n“‘And how far from the edge of the wood?’\n“‘About the same.’\n“‘Then if it was removed it was while you were within a dozen yards of it?’\n“‘Yes, but with my back towards it.’\n“This concluded the examination of the witness.”\n“I see,” said I as I glanced down the column, “that the coroner in his concluding remarks was rather severe upon young McCarthy. He calls attention, and with reason, to the discrepancy about his father having signalled to him before seeing him, also to his refusal to give details of his conversation with his father, and his singular account of his father’s dying words. They are all, as he remarks, very much against the son.”\nHolmes laughed softly to himself and stretched himself out upon the cushioned seat. “Both you and the coroner have been at some pains,” said he, “to single out the very strongest points in the young man’s favour. Don’t you see that you alternately give him credit for having too much imagination and too little? Too little, if he could not invent a cause of quarrel which would give him the sympathy of the jury; too much, if he evolved from his own inner consciousness anything so outré as a dying reference to a rat, and the incident of the vanishing cloth. No, sir, I shall approach this case from the point of view that what this young man says is true, and we shall see whither that hypothesis will lead us. And now here is my pocket Petrarch, and not another word shall I say of this case until we are on the scene of action. We lunch at Swindon, and I see that we shall be there in twenty minutes.”",

            "prefix-probing": "“There are one or two minor points which were brought out in the inquest, and which are worth considering.” Sherlock Holmes spoke with his usual calm precision, his keen eyes fixed upon Dr. Watson as they sat in the familiar quarters at 221B Baker Street. The fire crackled softly in the hearth, casting flickering shadows upon the walls lined with books and curious artifacts from their many adventures.\n\nWatson leaned forward, his interest piqued. “Pray, Holmes, what points do you refer to? The case of the Speckled Band has been puzzling me ever since I first heard the details.”\n\nHolmes nodded thoughtfully. “Indeed, Watson. The case is a masterful example of misdirection and the subtle use of natural phenomena to mask a crime. Let us recall the facts as they were presented at the inquest.”\n\nHe paused, then began to enumerate. “Miss Julia Stoner, the unfortunate young lady, had been living with her stepfather, Dr. Grimesby Roylott, at Stoke Moran. She had confided in her sister Helen that she feared for her life, mentioning a strange whistle in the night and the mysterious disappearance of her twin sister’s engagement to a man named Rylott. The night she died, she was found in her locked room, her face contorted in terror, and the cause of death was a venomous bite.”\n\nWatson interjected, “The venomous bite was from the speckled band, which we later discovered to be a swamp adder, the deadliest snake in India.”\n\n“Precisely,” Holmes affirmed. “But the minor points I wish to highlight are the presence of the ventilator connecting the two rooms, the dummy bell-pull that did not function, and the curious fact that the bed was clamped to the floor.”\n\n“Ah, yes,” Watson mused. “These details seemed trivial at the time, but now I see their significance.”\n\nHolmes smiled. “They are the key to understanding the method of the crime. The ventilator allowed the snake to pass from Dr. Roylott’s room into Julia’s. The dummy bell-pull was a conduit for the snake’s movement, and the clamped bed prevented the victim from escaping the deadly assault.”\n\nHe leaned back, steepling his fingers. “Dr. Roylott, a man of great physical strength and a violent temper, had motive and means. His financial interests were threatened by the marriage of his stepdaughters, which would have reduced his income. The use of the snake was a cunning method to avoid suspicion.”\n\nWatson shook his head in amazement. “Holmes, your deductions are as brilliant as ever. The way you pieced together these minor details to reveal the truth is truly remarkable.”\n\nHolmes shrugged modestly. “It is the careful observation of such details that separates the detective from the ordinary man. The devil, as they say, is in the details.”\n\nAs the night deepened, the two friends continued to discuss the case, their conversation weaving through the intricacies of human nature, the art of deduction, and the relentless pursuit of justice. The Speckled Band case, with its blend of mystery and menace, remained etched in their memories as a testament to the power of reason and the triumph of truth over deception."

          "text_segment": "It was nearly four o’clock when we at last, after passing through the beautiful Stroud Valley, and over the broad gleaming Severn, found ourselves at the pretty little country-town of Ross. A lean, ferret-like man, furtive and sly-looking, was waiting for us upon the platform. In spite of the light brown dustcoat and leather-leggings which he wore in deference to his rustic surroundings, I had no difficulty in recognising Lestrade, of Scotland Yard. With him we drove to the Hereford Arms where a room had already been engaged for us.\n“I have ordered a carriage,” said Lestrade as we sat over a cup of tea. “I knew your energetic nature, and that you would not be happy until you had been on the scene of the crime.”\n“It was very nice and complimentary of you,” Holmes answered. “It is entirely a question of barometric pressure.”\nLestrade looked startled. “I do not quite follow,” he said.\n“How is the glass? Twenty-nine, I see. No wind, and not a cloud in the sky. I have a caseful of cigarettes here which need smoking, and the sofa is very much superior to the usual country hotel abomination. I do not think that it is probable that I shall use the carriage to-night.”\nLestrade laughed indulgently. “You have, no doubt, already formed your conclusions from the newspapers,” he said. “The case is as plain as a pikestaff, and the more one goes into it the plainer it becomes. Still, of course, one can’t refuse a lady, and such a very positive one, too. She has heard of you, and would have your opinion, though I repeatedly told her that there was nothing which you could do which I had not already done. Why, bless my soul! here is her carriage at the door.”\nHe had hardly spoken before there rushed into the room one of the most lovely young women that I have ever seen in my life. Her violet eyes shining, her lips parted, a pink flush upon her cheeks, all thought of her natural reserve lost in her overpowering excitement and concern.\n“Oh, Mr. Sherlock Holmes!” she cried, glancing from one to the other of us, and finally, with a woman’s quick intuition, fastening upon my companion, “I am so glad that you have come. I have driven down to tell you so. I know that James didn’t do it. I know it, and I want you to start upon your work knowing it, too. Never let yourself doubt upon that point. We have known each other since we were little children, and I know his faults as no one else does; but he is too tender-hearted to hurt a fly. Such a charge is absurd to anyone who really knows him.”\n“I hope we may clear him, Miss Turner,” said Sherlock Holmes. “You may rely upon my doing all that I can.”\n“But you have read the evidence. You have formed some conclusion? Do you not see some loophole, some flaw? Do you not yourself think that he is innocent?”\n“I think that it is very probable.”\n“There, now!” she cried, throwing back her head and looking defiantly at Lestrade. “You hear! He gives me hopes.”\nLestrade shrugged his shoulders. “I am afraid that my colleague has been a little quick in forming his conclusions,” he said.\n“But he is right. Oh! I know that he is right. James never did it. And about his quarrel with his father, I am sure that the reason why he would not speak about it to the coroner was because I was concerned in it.”\n“In what way?” asked Holmes.\n“It is no time for me to hide anything. James and his father had many disagreements about me. Mr. McCarthy was very anxious that there should be a marriage between us. James and I have always loved each other as brother and sister; but of course he is young and has seen very little of life yet, and—and—well, he naturally did not wish to do anything like that yet. So there were quarrels, and this, I am sure, was one of them.”\n“And your father?” asked Holmes. “Was he in favour of such a union?”\n“No, he was averse to it also. No one but Mr. McCarthy was in favour of it.” A quick blush passed over her fresh young face as Holmes shot one of his keen, questioning glances at her.\n“Thank you for this information,” said he. “May I see your father if I call to-morrow?”\n“I am afraid the doctor won’t allow it.”\n“The doctor?”\n“Yes, have you not heard? Poor father has never been strong for years back, but this has broken him down completely. He has taken to his bed, and Dr. Willows says that he is a wreck and that his nervous system is shattered. Mr. McCarthy was the only man alive who had known dad in the old days in Victoria.”\n“Ha! In Victoria! That is important.”\n“Yes, at the mines.”\n“Quite so; at the gold-mines, where, as I understand, Mr. Turner made his money.”\n“Yes, certainly.”\n“Thank you, Miss Turner. You have been of material assistance to me.”\n“You will tell me if you have any news to-morrow. No doubt you will go to the prison to see James. Oh, if you do, Mr. Holmes, do tell him that I know him to be innocent.”\n“I will, Miss Turner.”\n“I must go home now, for dad is very ill, and he misses me so if I leave him. Good-bye, and God help you in your undertaking.” She hurried from the room as impulsively as she had entered, and we heard the wheels of her carriage rattle off down the street.",

            "prefix-probing": "The sun was shining brightly, and the air was fresh and invigorating as we stepped out of the carriage. The town was quaint and charming, with its old stone buildings and narrow streets winding their way up the gentle hills. We had come to Ross on the invitation of a friend, and I was eager to see what adventures awaited us in this peaceful corner of the English countryside.\n\nAs we made our way through the town, I could not help but notice the curious glances of the townsfolk. There was an air of expectancy about the place, as if something unusual had recently occurred. My companion, Sherlock Holmes, seemed equally alert, his keen eyes taking in every detail with his usual intensity.\n\n\"Watson,\" he said quietly, \"there is a story here, and I intend to uncover it.\"\n\nWe soon found our way to the inn where we were to stay, a cozy establishment called The Red Lion. The landlord greeted us warmly and showed us to our rooms. After freshening up, we met in the common room, where a fire crackled invitingly in the hearth.\n\nHolmes wasted no time in striking up a conversation with the other guests, his sharp mind probing for information. It was not long before he learned of a recent series of strange occurrences in the town—disappearances, mysterious noises at night, and an overall sense of unease among the residents.\n\n\"This is precisely the sort of case that appeals to me,\" Holmes remarked, his eyes gleaming with excitement. \"We must begin our inquiries at once.\"\n\nThe following morning, we set out to explore the town and its surroundings. Our first stop was the local magistrate's office, where we hoped to find records of the reported incidents. The magistrate, a stern but fair man named Mr. Harding, was cooperative and provided us with detailed accounts of the events.\n\n\"It began about a month ago,\" he explained. \"Several villagers have vanished without a trace. There have been no signs of struggle, no clues left behind. The townspeople are frightened, and some have even taken to locking themselves indoors after dark.\"\n\nHolmes listened intently, his fingers steepled beneath his chin. \"Have there been any sightings or unusual activity reported?\"\n\n\"Only strange noises at night—whispers, footsteps, and sometimes a low, mournful wail. No one has been able to identify the source.\"\n\nWe thanked Mr. Harding and continued our investigation, visiting the homes of those who had disappeared and speaking with their families. Each story was more perplexing than the last, with no apparent motive or explanation.\n\nAs evening fell, we returned to The Red Lion, where Holmes sat by the fire, deep in thought. \"Watson,\" he said suddenly, \"I believe the key to this mystery lies in the old abbey ruins on the outskirts of town.\"\n\nThe next day, we made our way to the abbey, a crumbling structure shrouded in ivy and shadow. As we explored the ancient stone corridors, Holmes's keen eyes caught sight of a hidden passage concealed behind a loose wall panel.\n\nWith some effort, we managed to pry open the panel and discovered a narrow staircase leading down into darkness. Lighting our lanterns, we descended into the depths below.\n\nThe subterranean chamber was vast and filled with strange symbols etched into the walls. In the center stood a stone altar, upon which lay a collection of peculiar artifacts—ancient coins, faded parchments, and a small, intricately carved box.\n\nHolmes carefully examined the box, noting its craftsmanship and the strange markings adorning its surface. \"This,\" he declared, \"is the source of the town's troubles.\"\n\nOpening the box, we found a collection of letters and documents revealing a long-forgotten secret society that had once operated in the area. The society had been involved in clandestine activities, and their relics had been hidden away to protect them from discovery.\n\nIt became clear that someone had recently uncovered the box and was using its contents to instill fear and manipulate the townspeople for their own gain. Holmes deduced that the perpetrator was likely a local resident with intimate knowledge of the abbey and its history.\n\nReturning to the town, we began to narrow down our suspects, focusing on those with the means and motive to carry out such a scheme. After careful observation and a series of discreet inquiries, Holmes identified the culprit—a disgruntled former member of the town council seeking revenge.\n\nConfronted with the evidence, the man confessed to orchestrating the disappearances and spreading rumors to destabilize the community. With the mystery solved, peace returned to Ross, and the townsfolk expressed their gratitude to Holmes and me.\n\nAs we prepared to leave, I reflected on the events that had unfolded in this quiet town. It was a reminder that even in the most tranquil places, darkness could lurk beneath the surface, and it was the duty of those with keen minds and brave hearts to bring the truth to light.\n\nOur journey continued, but the memory of Ross and its secrets remained with me, a testament to the enduring power of observation and deduction in the face of mystery."

We have still time to take a train to Hereford and see him to-night?”\n“Ample.”\n“Then let us do so. Watson, I fear that you will find it very slow, but I shall only be away a couple of hours.”\nI walked down to the station with them, and then wandered through the streets of the little town, finally returning to the hotel, where I lay upon the sofa and tried to interest myself in a yellow-backed novel. The puny plot of the story was so thin, however, when compared to the deep mystery through which we were groping, and I found my attention wander so continually from the action to the fact, that I at last flung it across the room and gave myself up entirely to a consideration of the events of the day. Supposing that this unhappy young man’s story were absolutely true, then what hellish thing, what absolutely unforeseen and extraordinary calamity could have occurred between the time when he parted from his father, and the moment when, drawn back by his screams, he rushed into the glade? It was something terrible and deadly. What could it be? Might not the nature of the injuries reveal something to my medical instincts? I rang the bell and called for the weekly county paper, which contained a verbatim account of the inquest. In the surgeon’s deposition it was stated that the posterior third of the left parietal bone and the left half of the occipital bone had been shattered by a heavy blow from a blunt weapon. I marked the spot upon my own head. Clearly such a blow must have been struck from behind. That was to some extent in favour of the accused, as when seen quarrelling he was face to face with his father. Still, it did not go for very much, for the older man might have turned his back before the blow fell. Still, it might be worth while to call Holmes’ attention to it. Then there was the peculiar dying reference to a rat. What could that mean? It could not be delirium. A man dying from a sudden blow does not commonly become delirious. No, it was more likely to be an attempt to explain how he met his fate. But what could it indicate? I cudgelled my brains to find some possible explanation. And then the incident of the grey cloth seen by young McCarthy. If that were true the murderer must have dropped some part of his dress, presumably his overcoat, in his flight, and must have had the hardihood to return and to carry it away at the instant when the son was kneeling with his back turned not a dozen paces off. What a tissue of mysteries and improbabilities the whole thing was! I did not wonder at Lestrade’s opinion, and yet I had so much faith in Sherlock Holmes’ insight that I could not lose hope as long as every fresh fact seemed to strengthen his conviction of young McCarthy’s innocence.",

A venomous snake, trained to kill.”\n\nLestrade shook his head. “That is impossible.”\n\nHolmes shrugged. “Nothing is impossible, Lestrade, if you have the right knowledge and the right tools.”\n\nLestrade looked skeptical. “And how did you come to this conclusion?”\n\nHolmes explained the details of his investigation, the clues he had found, and the deductions he had made. He described the strange whistle, the ventilator, the fake bell-pull, and the presence of the snake.\n\nLestrade listened intently, his skepticism giving way to curiosity.\n\n“And what happened next?” he asked.\n\nHolmes smiled. “I confronted the villain, Dr. Roylott, and he was caught in the act. The snake turned on him, and he was killed by his own weapon.”\n\nLestrade shook his head in amazement. “I must admit, Holmes, that you have outdone yourself this time.”\n\nHolmes shrugged modestly. “It was a matter of observation and deduction, Lestrade. Nothing more.”\n\nLestrade smiled. “Well, I am glad that justice has been served. And I am glad that you have cleared up this mystery.”\n\nHolmes nodded. “As am I. And I hope that this case will serve as a reminder that appearances can be deceiving, and that the truth is often hidden beneath the surface.”\n\nLestrade stood up. “I will report this to the authorities, Holmes. And I will make sure that the story is told accurately.”\n\nHolmes smiled. “Thank you, Lestrade. I am sure that the public will be interested in this case.”\n\nLestrade nodded. “Indeed they will. And I will make sure that you receive the credit you deserve.”\n\nHolmes smiled. “Thank you, Lestrade. That is very kind of you.”\n\nLestrade turned to leave. “Well, Holmes, I must be going. I have other cases to attend to.”\n\nHolmes nodded. “Of course, Lestrade. Good luck with your work.”\n\nLestrade left the room, and Holmes sat back in his chair, a satisfied smile on his face. The mystery of the Speckled Band had been solved, and justice had been served. It was another triumph for the great detective, Sherlock Holmes."

          "text_segment": "It was late before Sherlock Holmes returned. He came back alone, for Lestrade was staying in lodgings in the town.\n“The glass still keeps very high,” he remarked as he sat down. “It is of importance that it should not rain before we are able to go over the ground. On the other hand, a man should be at his very best and keenest for such nice work as that, and I did not wish to do it when fagged by a long journey. I have seen young McCarthy.”\n“And what did you learn from him?”\n“Nothing.”\n“Could he throw no light?”\n“None at all. I was inclined to think at one time that he knew who had done it and was screening him or her, but I am convinced now that he is as puzzled as everyone else. He is not a very quick-witted youth, though comely to look at and, I should think, sound at heart.”\n“I cannot admire his taste,” I remarked, “if it is indeed a fact that he was averse to a marriage with so charming a young lady as this Miss Turner.”\n“Ah, thereby hangs a rather painful tale. This fellow is madly, insanely, in love with her, but some two years ago, when he was only a lad, and before he really knew her, for she had been away five years at a boarding-school, what does the idiot do but get into the clutches of a barmaid in Bristol and marry her at a registry office? No one knows a word of the matter, but you can imagine how maddening it must be to him to be upbraided for not doing what he would give his very eyes to do, but what he knows to be absolutely impossible. It was sheer frenzy of this sort which made him throw his hands up into the air when his father, at their last interview, was goading him on to propose to Miss Turner. On the other hand, he had no means of supporting himself, and his father, who was by all accounts a very hard man, would have thrown him over utterly had he known the truth. It was with his barmaid wife that he had spent the last three days in Bristol, and his father did not know where he was. Mark that point. It is of importance. Good has come out of evil, however, for the barmaid, finding from the papers that he is in serious trouble and likely to be hanged, has thrown him over utterly and has written to him to say that she has a husband already in the Bermuda Dockyard, so that there is really no tie between them. I think that that bit of news has consoled young McCarthy for all that he has suffered.”\n“But if he is innocent, who has done it?”\n“Ah! who? I would call your attention very particularly to two points. One is that the murdered man had an appointment with someone at the pool, and that the someone could not have been his son, for his son was away, and he did not know when he would return. The second is that the murdered man was heard to cry ‘Cooee!’ before he knew that his son had returned. Those are the crucial points upon which the case depends. And now let us talk about George Meredith, if you please, and we shall leave all minor matters until to-morrow.”",

            "prefix-probing": "It was late before Sherlock Holmes returned. The night had deepened into a profound silence, broken only by the occasional rustle of leaves and the distant hoot of an owl. I had been waiting anxiously in our rooms at 221B Baker Street, the flickering gaslight casting long shadows upon the walls. The case we had been pursuing was one of the most perplexing I had ever encountered, and Holmes's prolonged absence only heightened my concern.\n\nWhen he finally entered, his face was pale but illuminated by a spark of triumph. \"Watson,\" he said, \"I have unraveled the mystery that has so confounded us.\"\n\nI rose from my chair, eager to hear the details. \"Pray, do not keep me in suspense.\"\n\nHolmes paced the room, his keen eyes gleaming. \"The key lies in the seemingly innocuous letter we discovered earlier. Its peculiar phrasing and the subtle indentation on the paper suggested a hidden message. Upon closer examination, I found a cipher embedded within the text, revealing the location of the missing heirloom.\"\n\nI listened intently as he recounted the steps he had taken, the deductions made, and the obstacles overcome. The case involved a complex web of deceit, involving a noble family, a treacherous servant, and a clandestine meeting under the cover of darkness.\n\n\"The servant,\" Holmes continued, \"had been manipulating events to cover his own tracks. His knowledge of the household's routines allowed him to orchestrate the theft with precision. However, his arrogance led to a critical error, which I exploited to uncover the truth.\"\n\nHe produced a small, ornate box from his pocket. \"Here is the heirloom, recovered from the secret compartment behind the fireplace.\"\n\nI examined the box, admiring its craftsmanship. \"Remarkable, Holmes. Your intellect never ceases to amaze me.\"\n\nHe smiled modestly. \"It is the application of observation and deduction, Watson. The world is full of clues, if one only knows how to see them.\"\n\nAs the night wore on, we discussed the implications of the case and the lessons it offered. Holmes's passion for justice and his unwavering commitment to truth were evident in every word.\n\nFinally, as dawn approached, I retired to my bed, grateful for the resolution of the mystery and the companionship of my extraordinary friend. The adventures of Sherlock Holmes continued to unfold, each more fascinating than the last, and I was privileged to bear witness to them."

          "text_segment": "There was no rain, as Holmes had foretold, and the morning broke bright and cloudless. At nine o’clock Lestrade called for us with the carriage, and we set off for Hatherley Farm and the Boscombe Pool.\n“There is serious news this morning,” Lestrade observed. “It is said that Mr. Turner, of the Hall, is so ill that his life is despaired of.”\n“An elderly man, I presume?” said Holmes.\n“About sixty; but his constitution has been shattered by his life abroad, and he has been in failing health for some time. This business has had a very bad effect upon him. He was an old friend of McCarthy’s, and, I may add, a great benefactor to him, for I have learned that he gave him Hatherley Farm rent free.”\n“Indeed! That is interesting,” said Holmes.\n“Oh, yes! In a hundred other ways he has helped him. Everybody about here speaks of his kindness to him.”\n“Really! Does it not strike you as a little singular that this McCarthy, who appears to have had little of his own, and to have been under such obligations to Turner, should still talk of marrying his son to Turner’s daughter, who is, presumably, heiress to the estate, and that in such a very cocksure manner, as if it were merely a case of a proposal and all else would follow? It is the more strange, since we know that Turner himself was averse to the idea. The daughter told us as much. Do you not deduce something from that?”\n“We have got to the deductions and the inferences,” said Lestrade, winking at me. “I find it hard enough to tackle facts, Holmes, without flying away after theories and fancies.”\n“You are right,” said Holmes demurely; “you do find it very hard to tackle the facts.”\n“Anyhow, I have grasped one fact which you seem to find it difficult to get hold of,” replied Lestrade with some warmth.\n“And that is—”\n“That McCarthy senior met his death from McCarthy junior and that all theories to the contrary are the merest moonshine.”\n“Well, moonshine is a brighter thing than fog,” said Holmes, laughing. “But I am very much mistaken if this is not Hatherley Farm upon the left.”\n“Yes, that is it.” It was a widespread, comfortable-looking building, two-storied, slate-roofed, with great yellow blotches of lichen upon the grey walls. The drawn blinds and the smokeless chimneys, however, gave it a stricken look, as though the weight of this horror still lay heavy upon it. We called at the door, when the maid, at Holmes’ request, showed us the boots which her master wore at the time of his death, and also a pair of the son’s, though not the pair which he had then had. Having measured these very carefully from seven or eight different points, Holmes desired to be led to the court-yard, from which we all followed the winding track which led to Boscombe Pool.\nSherlock Holmes was transformed when he was hot upon such a scent as this. Men who had only known the quiet thinker and logician of Baker Street would have failed to recognise him. His face flushed and darkened. His brows were drawn into two hard black lines, while his eyes shone out from beneath them with a steely glitter. His face was bent downward, his shoulders bowed, his lips compressed, and the veins stood out like whipcord in his long, sinewy neck. His nostrils seemed to dilate with a purely animal lust for the chase, and his mind was so absolutely concentrated upon the matter before him that a question or remark fell unheeded upon his ears, or, at the most, only provoked a quick, impatient snarl in reply. Swiftly and silently he made his way along the track which ran through the meadows, and so by way of the woods to the Boscombe Pool. It was damp, marshy ground, as is all that district, and there were marks of many feet, both upon the path and amid the short grass which bounded it on either side. Sometimes Holmes would hurry on, sometimes stop dead, and once he made quite a little detour into the meadow. Lestrade and I walked behind him, the detective indifferent and contemptuous, while I watched my friend with the interest which sprang from the conviction that every one of his actions was directed towards a definite end.\nThe Boscombe Pool, which is a little reed-girt sheet of water some fifty yards across, is situated at the boundary between the Hatherley Farm and the private park of the wealthy Mr. Turner. Above the woods which lined it upon the farther side we could see the red, jutting pinnacles which marked the site of the rich landowner’s dwelling. On the Hatherley side of the pool the woods grew very thick, and there was a narrow belt of sodden grass twenty paces across between the edge of the trees and the reeds which lined the lake. Lestrade showed us the exact spot at which the body had been found, and, indeed, so moist was the ground, that I could plainly see the traces which had been left by the fall of the stricken man. To Holmes, as I could see by his eager face and peering eyes, very many other things were to be read upon the trampled grass. He ran round, like a dog who is picking up a scent, and then turned upon my companion.\n“What did you go into the pool for?” he asked.\n“I fished about with a rake. I thought there might be some weapon or other trace. But how on earth—”\n“Oh, tut, tut! I have no time! That left foot of yours with its inward twist is all over the place. A mole could trace it, and there it vanishes among the reeds. Oh, how simple it would all have been had I been here before they came like a herd of buffalo and wallowed all over it. Here is where the party with the lodge-keeper came, and they have covered all tracks for six or eight feet round the body. But here are three separate tracks of the same feet.” He drew out a lens and lay down upon his waterproof to have a better view, talking all the time rather to himself than to us. “These are young McCarthy’s feet. Twice he was walking, and once he ran swiftly, so that the soles are deeply marked and the heels hardly visible. That bears out his story. He ran when he saw his father on the ground. Then here are the father’s feet as he paced up and down. What is this, then? It is the butt-end of the gun as the son stood listening. And this? Ha, ha! What have we here? Tiptoes! tiptoes! Square, too, quite unusual boots! They come, they go, they come again—of course that was for the cloak. Now where did they come from?” He ran up and down, sometimes losing, sometimes finding the track until we were well within the edge of the wood and under the shadow of a great beech, the largest tree in the neighbourhood. Holmes traced his way to the farther side of this and lay down once more upon his face with a little cry of satisfaction. For a long time he remained there, turning over the leaves and dried sticks, gathering up what seemed to me to be dust into an envelope and examining with his lens not only the ground but even the bark of the tree as far as he could reach. A jagged stone was lying among the moss, and this also he carefully examined and retained. Then he followed a pathway through the wood until he came to the high road, where all traces were lost.\n“It has been a case of considerable interest,” he remarked, returning to his natural manner. “I fancy that this grey house on the right must be the lodge. I think that I will go in and have a word with Moran, and perhaps write a little note. Having done that, we may drive back to our luncheon. You may walk to the cab, and I shall be with you presently.”",

              "simple_agent_extraction": "There was no rain, as Holmes had foretold, and the morning broke bright and cloudless. At nine o'clock sharp, Lestrade arrived in a dogcart, and we set off at once for Boscombe Pool. The inspector was grave and silent, and it was not until we were well on our way that he spoke. \"I have bad news for you, Watson,\" he said. \"Mr. Turner is very ill.\"\n\n\"Indeed! How old is he?\"\n\n\"About sixty, I should say. He has been ailing for some time, and the death of McCarthy has quite upset him.\"\n\n\"I understand that he was a great benefactor to the McCarthys?\"\n\n\"Yes, he was. He gave them Hatherley Farm rent-free, and helped them in many ways.\"\n\nHolmes frowned thoughtfully. \"It is curious,\" he said, \"that McCarthy should have been so indebted to Turner, and yet should have urged his son to marry Turner's daughter, against the wishes of the old man himself.\"\n\nLestrade shrugged. \"You and your deductions and inferences! I prefer facts.\"\n\n\"And I find that you have a hard time dealing with facts.\"\n\n\"The fact is that James McCarthy killed his father.\"\n\n\"Your certainty is like a fog, Lestrade, and my theories are like moonshine.\"\n\nWe soon reached Hatherley Farm, and Holmes at once set to work.

At nine o'clock sharp, Lestrade arrived in a dogcart, and we set off at once for Boscombe Pool. The inspector was grave and silent, and it was not until we were well on our way that he spoke. \"I have bad news for you, Watson,\" he said. \"Mr. Turner is very ill.\"\n\n\"Indeed! How old is he?\"\n\n\"About sixty, I should say. He has been ailing for some time, and the death of McCarthy has quite upset him.\"\n\n\"I understand that he was a great benefactor to the McCarthys?\"\n\n\"Yes, he was. He gave them Hatherley Farm rent-free, and helped them in many ways.\"\n\nHolmes frowned thoughtfully. \"It is curious,\" he said, \"that McCarthy should have been so indebted to Turner, and yet should have urged his son to marry Turner's daughter, against the wishes of the old man himself.\"\n\nLestrade shrugged. \"You and your deductions and inferences! I prefer facts.\"\n\n\"And I find that you have a hard time dealing with facts.\"\n\n\"The fact is that James McCarthy killed his father.\"\n\n\"Your certainty is like a fog, Lestrade, and my theories are like moonshine.\"\n\nWe soon reached Hatherley Farm, and Holmes at once set to work. He examined the boots which the elder McCarthy had worn on the day of his death, and compared them with a pair belonging to the son, taking careful measurements.\n\nFrom there, we followed the path to Boscombe Pool.

            "prefix-probing": "There was no rain, as Holmes had foretold, and the morning broke bright and cloudless. The sun shone with a cheerful warmth, casting long shadows across the dew-kissed grass. Holmes and I set out early, our spirits buoyed by the promise of a clear day and the hope that our inquiries would soon bear fruit.\n\nWe made our way to the scene of the previous night's disturbance, a modest cottage on the outskirts of the village. The air was filled with the scent of blooming lilacs and freshly turned earth, a stark contrast to the grim events that had unfolded there. Holmes moved with purpose, his keen eyes scanning every detail, every footprint, every broken twig.\n\n\"Observe, Watson,\" he said, kneeling beside a patch of disturbed soil. \"The soil here is softer, indicating recent activity. Notice the direction of these impressions—they lead towards the hedge, but there is a peculiar absence of any return marks. Our suspect did not retrace his steps this way.\"\n\nI followed his gaze and nodded, impressed by his attention to detail. \"So, he must have exited through another route?\"\n\nHolmes smiled faintly. \"Precisely. Let us examine the hedge more closely.\"\n\nWe approached the dense thicket, and Holmes began to part the branches with gentle hands. Behind the foliage, we discovered a narrow gap, barely wide enough for a man to slip through. The ground was trampled, and the leaves bore signs of recent disturbance.\n\n\"Here is our exit,\" Holmes declared. \"Our man escaped through this covert passage, avoiding the main road and any prying eyes.\"\n\nAs we retraced our steps, Holmes's mind seemed to be working at a feverish pace. He spoke little, but his eyes gleamed with the thrill of the chase. We returned to the village, where Holmes intended to question the locals and gather any information that might shed light on the mystery.\n\nAt the village inn, we found a group of farmers and laborers engaged in animated conversation. Holmes approached them with his usual confidence and began to inquire about any unusual occurrences during the night.\n\n\"Did you see or hear anything out of the ordinary?\" he asked.\n\nAn elderly man with a weathered face spoke up. \"Aye, sir, there was a strange light near the old mill, and I heard footsteps, though the place is abandoned these days.\"\n\nHolmes's eyes narrowed. \"The old mill, you say? That is a curious detail.\"\n\nWe thanked the men and made our way to the mill, a dilapidated structure that stood silent against the morning sky. Holmes examined the area with meticulous care, noting the position of stones, the state of the door, and the surrounding vegetation.\n\n\"This place has been used recently,\" he observed. \"See here—the footprints are fresh, and the door has been forced open.\"\n\nInside, the mill was dark and musty, the air thick with the scent of damp wood and mold. Holmes moved deeper into the shadows, his lantern casting flickering light upon the walls. Suddenly, he stopped and pointed to a corner where a bundle of cloth lay discarded.\n\n\"A clue,\" he murmured, picking up the fabric. \"This is torn from a coat, and the fibers match those found at the cottage. Our suspect is careless, but not careless enough to escape my notice.\"\n\nWe continued our search, and as the day wore on, Holmes pieced together the fragments of the puzzle. The suspect was a man familiar with the village, someone who knew the secret paths and hidden passages. He was desperate, driven by motives that remained unclear but hinted at a deeper intrigue.\n\nAs evening approached, we returned to our lodgings, where Holmes sat by the fire, lost in thought. I could see the wheels turning in his mind, the relentless pursuit of truth that defined his very being.\n\n\"Watson,\" he said at last, \"tomorrow we shall confront our suspect. I have arranged a meeting that will bring this mystery to a head.\"\n\nI nodded, eager to see the conclusion of our adventure. The night was calm, the stars shining brightly overhead, as if in silent witness to the unfolding drama.\n\nThe next morning dawned with a gentle breeze and a sky painted in hues of pink and gold. Holmes and I made our way to the village square, where a small crowd had gathered, drawn by the promise of revelation.\n\nOur suspect appeared, a man of middling stature and unremarkable features, yet there was a tension in his bearing that betrayed his inner turmoil. Holmes addressed him directly, his voice steady and commanding.\n\n\"You have been observed moving under cover of darkness, trespassing upon private property, and engaging in activities that have disturbed the peace of this village. What have you to say in your defense?\"\n\nThe man hesitated, then spoke in a low voice. \"I sought only to recover what was taken from me, to reclaim a legacy that was stolen.\"\n\nHolmes's eyes gleamed with understanding. \"And what is this legacy?\"\n\nThe man produced a small, worn box, its surface etched with intricate designs. \"This belonged to my family, passed down through generations. It was taken by a relative who sought to claim it as his own.\"\n\nHolmes examined the box carefully, then turned to the crowd. \"This matter is one of personal grievance, not criminal intent. However, the methods employed were ill-advised.\"\n\nThe villagers murmured among themselves, their anger giving way to sympathy. The man was led away, not to punishment, but to reconciliation and restitution.\n\nAs we departed, Holmes turned to me with a rare smile. \"Another case resolved, Watson, not by force or fear, but by understanding and justice.\"\n\nI could not help but agree, grateful for the insight and wisdom of my remarkable friend. The sun continued to shine, and the village returned to its peaceful existence, the shadows of mystery lifted by the light of truth."

It had only lain there a few days. There was no sign of a place whence it had been taken. It corresponds with the injuries.

There are several other indications, but these may be enough to aid us in our search.”\nLestrade laughed. “I am afraid that I am still a sceptic,” he said. “Theories are all very well, but we have to deal with a hard-headed British jury.”\n“Nous verrons,” answered Holmes calmly. “You work your own method, and I shall work mine. I shall be busy this afternoon, and shall probably return to London by the evening train.”\n“And leave your case unfinished?”\n“No, finished.”\n“But the mystery?”\n“It is solved.”\n“Who was the criminal, then?”\n“The gentleman I describe.”\n“But who is he?”\n“Surely it would not be difficult to find out.

I should become the laughing-stock of Scotland Yard.”\n“All right,” said Holmes quietly. “I have given you the chance. Here are your lodgings. Good-bye. I shall drop you a line before I leave.”\nHaving left Lestrade at his rooms, we drove to our hotel, where we found lunch upon the table. Holmes was silent and buried in thought with a pained expression upon his face, as one who finds himself in a perplexing position.\n“Look here, Watson,” he said when the cloth was cleared “just sit down in this chair and let me preach to you for a little.

One was the fact that his father should, according to his account, cry ‘Cooee!’ before seeing him. The other was his singular dying reference to a rat. He mumbled several words, you understand, but that was all that caught the son’s ear. Now from this double point our research must commence, and we will begin it by presuming that what the lad says is absolutely true.”\n“What of this ‘Cooee!’ then?”\n“Well, obviously it could not have been meant for the son. The son, as far as he knew, was in Bristol. It was mere chance that he was within earshot. The ‘Cooee!’ was meant to attract the attention of whoever it was that he had the appointment with. But ‘Cooee’ is a distinctly Australian cry, and one which is used between Australians. There is a strong presumption that the person whom McCarthy expected to meet him at Boscombe Pool was someone who had been in Australia.”\n“What of the rat, then?”\nSherlock Holmes took a folded paper from his pocket and flattened it out on the table. “This is a map of the Colony of Victoria,” he said. “I wired to Bristol for it last night.” He put his hand over part of the map. “What do you read?”\n“ARAT,” I read.\n“And now?” He raised his hand.\n“BALLARAT.”\n“Quite so.

The murderer is an Australian from Ballarat.\"\n\n\"And the grey garment?\"\n\n\"That is the third certainty, if James McCarthy's story is true. The man in the grey cloak is the man from Ballarat.\"\n\n\"But the pool is only accessible from the farm or from Turner's private estate.\"\n\n\"Exactly. The man must be familiar with the locality.\"\n\n\"And the other details?\"\n\n\"I have given them to Lestrade. The length of the stride shows the height of the man. The peculiar boots are a distinctive mark. The lameness was deduced from the fact that the right foot's impression was less distinct, indicating less weight borne upon it. The left-handedness was inferred from the injury on the left side, which could only have been inflicted by a left-handed assailant.\"\n\n\"How did you know about the cigar ash?\"\n\n\"I have written a monograph on tobacco ashes. The ash behind the tree was Indian cigar ash. The cigar stump was found, and it was an Indian cigar rolled in Rotterdam. The use of a cigar-holder was deduced because the cigar tip was not bitten. The blunt pen-knife was inferred from the unclean cut on the cigar tip.\"\n\n\"Holmes, you have saved James McCarthy. I see that the culprit is Mr. John Turner.\"\n\nJust then the hotel waiter announced, \"Mr. John Turner.\"\n",

            "prefix-probing": "“Pray do so.”\n\nI had called upon my friend Sherlock Holmes one day in the autumn of last year and found him in deep conversation with a visitor. The man was tall and thin, with a pale face and keen eyes that seemed to miss nothing. Holmes, as always, was in his element, his sharp mind dissecting the details of the case before him.\n\n“Tell me everything from the beginning,” Holmes said, his voice calm but insistent.\n\nThe visitor, a Mr. John Openshaw, began his tale. He spoke of a mysterious letter he had received, warning him of impending danger. The letter was unsigned, but the handwriting was peculiar, and the paper bore a strange watermark. Openshaw explained that his family had been plagued by a series of misfortunes, each more baffling than the last.\n\nHolmes listened intently, his eyes narrowing as he pieced together the fragments of the story. “It is clear that someone wishes to intimidate you,” he remarked. “But why? And who?”\n\nThe visitor shrugged helplessly. “That is what I hope you can discover.”\n\nHolmes rose from his chair and began to pace the room. “We must examine the letter closely. Every detail may hold a clue.”\n\nHe took the letter from Openshaw and scrutinized it under his magnifying glass. The watermark, the ink, the folds—all were significant. “This is no ordinary threat,” Holmes mused. “It is a carefully crafted message designed to unsettle and confuse.”\n\nOver the next few days, Holmes and I delved deeper into the mystery, following leads that took us through the foggy streets of London and into the shadowy corners of society. Each step brought us closer to the truth, revealing a web of deceit and danger that threatened to ensnare us all.\n\nIn the end, it was Holmes’s unparalleled powers of observation and deduction that unraveled the case, exposing the culprit and restoring peace to the troubled family. As always, I was reminded of the extraordinary mind that lay behind the unassuming figure of my friend, the great Sherlock Holmes."

          "text_segment": "The man who entered was a strange and impressive figure. His slow, limping step and bowed shoulders gave the appearance of decrepitude, and yet his hard, deep-lined, craggy features, and his enormous limbs showed that he was possessed of unusual strength of body and of character. His tangled beard, grizzled hair, and outstanding, drooping eyebrows combined to give an air of dignity and power to his appearance, but his face was of an ashen white, while his lips and the corners of his nostrils were tinged with a shade of blue. It was clear to me at a glance that he was in the grip of some deadly and chronic disease.\n“Pray sit down on the sofa,” said Holmes gently. “You had my note?”\n“Yes, the lodge-keeper brought it up. You said that you wished to see me here to avoid scandal.”\n“I thought people would talk if I went to the Hall.”\n“And why did you wish to see me?” He looked across at my companion with despair in his weary eyes, as though his question was already answered.\n“Yes,” said Holmes, answering the look rather than the words. “It is so. I know all about McCarthy.”\nThe old man sank his face in his hands. “God help me!” he cried. “But I would not have let the young man come to harm. I give you my word that I would have spoken out if it went against him at the Assizes.”\n“I am glad to hear you say so,” said Holmes gravely.\n“I would have spoken now had it not been for my dear girl. It would break her heart—it will break her heart when she hears that I am arrested.”\n“It may not come to that,” said Holmes.\n“What?”\n“I am no official agent. I understand that it was your daughter who required my presence here, and I am acting in her interests. Young McCarthy must be got off, however.”\n“I am a dying man,” said old Turner. “I have had diabetes for years. My doctor says it is a question whether I shall live a month. Yet I would rather die under my own roof than in a gaol.”\nHolmes rose and sat down at the table with his pen in his hand and a bundle of paper before him. “Just tell us the truth,” he said. “I shall jot down the facts. You will sign it, and Watson here can witness it. Then I could produce your confession at the last extremity to save young McCarthy. I promise you that I shall not use it unless it is absolutely needed.”\n“It’s as well,” said the old man; “it’s a question whether I shall live to the Assizes, so it matters little to me, but I should wish to spare Alice the shock. And now I will make the thing clear to you; it has been a long time in the acting, but will not take me long to tell.\n“You didn’t know this dead man, McCarthy. He was a devil incarnate. I tell you that. God keep you out of the clutches of such a man as he. His grip has been upon me these twenty years, and he has blasted my life. I’ll tell you first how I came to be in his power.\n“It was in the early ’60’s at the diggings. I was a young chap then, hot-blooded and reckless, ready to turn my hand at anything; I got among bad companions, took to drink, had no luck with my claim, took to the bush, and in a word became what you would call over here a highway robber. There were six of us, and we had a wild, free life of it, sticking up a station from time to time, or stopping the wagons on the road to the diggings. Black Jack of Ballarat was the name I went under, and our party is still remembered in the colony as the Ballarat Gang.\n“One day a gold convoy came down from Ballarat to Melbourne, and we lay in wait for it and attacked it. There were six troopers and six of us, so it was a close thing, but we emptied four of their saddles at the first volley. Three of our boys were killed, however, before we got the swag. I put my pistol to the head of the wagon-driver, who was this very man McCarthy. I wish to the Lord that I had shot him then, but I spared him, though I saw his wicked little eyes fixed on my face, as though to remember every feature. We got away with the gold, became wealthy men, and made our way over to England without being suspected. There I parted from my old pals and determined to settle down to a quiet and respectable life. I bought this estate, which chanced to be in the market, and I set myself to do a little good with my money, to make up for the way in which I had earned it. I married, too, and though my wife died young she left me my dear little Alice. Even when she was just a baby her wee hand seemed to lead me down the right path as nothing else had ever done. In a word, I turned over a new leaf and did my best to make up for the past. All was going well when McCarthy laid his grip upon me.\n“I had gone up to town about an investment, and I met him in Regent Street with hardly a coat to his back or a boot to his foot.\n“‘Here we are, Jack,’ says he, touching me on the arm; ‘we’ll be as good as a family to you. There’s two of us, me and my son, and you can have the keeping of us. If you don’t—it’s a fine, law-abiding country is England, and there’s always a policeman within hail.’\n“Well, down they came to the west country, there was no shaking them off, and there they have lived rent free on my best land ever since. There was no rest for me, no peace, no forgetfulness; turn where I would, there was his cunning, grinning face at my elbow. It grew worse as Alice grew up, for he soon saw I was more afraid of her knowing my past than of the police. Whatever he wanted he must have, and whatever it was I gave him without question, land, money, houses, until at last he asked a thing which I could not give. He asked for Alice.\n“His son, you see, had grown up, and so had my girl, and as I was known to be in weak health, it seemed a fine stroke to him that his lad should step into the whole property. But there I was firm. I would not have his cursed stock mixed with mine; not that I had any dislike to the lad, but his blood was in him, and that was enough. I stood firm. McCarthy threatened. I braved him to do his worst. We were to meet at the pool midway between our houses to talk it over.\n“When I went down there I found him talking with his son, so I smoked a cigar and waited behind a tree until he should be alone. But as I listened to his talk all that was black and bitter in me seemed to come uppermost. He was urging his son to marry my daughter with as little regard for what she might think as if she were a slut from off the streets. It drove me mad to think that I and all that I held most dear should be in the power of such a man as this. Could I not snap the bond? I was already a dying and a desperate man. Though clear of mind and fairly strong of limb, I knew that my own fate was sealed. But my memory and my girl! Both could be saved if I could but silence that foul tongue. I did it, Mr. Holmes. I would do it again. Deeply as I have sinned, I have led a life of martyrdom to atone for it. But that my girl should be entangled in the same meshes which held me was more than I could suffer. I struck him down with no more compunction than if he had been some foul and venomous beast. His cry brought back his son; but I had gained the cover of the wood, though I was forced to go back to fetch the cloak which I had dropped in my flight. That is the true story, gentlemen, of all that occurred.”",

            "prefix-probing": "The man who entered was a strange and impressive figure. He was tall and gaunt, with a face that seemed carved from stone, sharp features etched deeply by time and experience. His eyes, dark and piercing, scanned the room with a mixture of curiosity and calculation. Clad in a long, weather-beaten coat and a wide-brimmed hat that cast a shadow over his brow, he carried an air of mystery that immediately commanded attention.\n\nSherlock Holmes, seated by the fire with Dr. Watson, looked up from his violin as the man approached. \"Good evening,\" the visitor said in a low, measured tone. \"I am in need of your assistance, Mr. Holmes.\"\n\nHolmes gestured to the empty chair opposite him. \"Pray, be seated. What brings you to Baker Street at this hour?\"\n\nThe man removed his hat, revealing a shock of graying hair. \"My name is Mr. Reginald Blackwood. I am a solicitor by profession, but tonight I come to you not in the capacity of a lawyer, but as a man desperate for answers.\"\n\nWatson leaned forward, intrigued. \"What sort of answers, Mr. Blackwood?\"\n\nBlackwood sighed deeply. \"It concerns a matter of life and death, and a mystery that has confounded the local authorities.\"\n\nHolmes's eyes gleamed with interest. \"Please, continue.\"\n\nBlackwood took a seat and began his tale. \"Two nights ago, in the quiet village of Little Hatherley, a young woman named Emily Carter vanished without a trace. She was last seen leaving the village inn after a late supper, but since then, no one has heard from her. The police have searched the surrounding woods and questioned the villagers, but to no avail.\"\n\n\"What makes this case particularly troubling,\" he continued, \"is that Emily was engaged to be married to a man named Thomas Grey, a local farmer. Their relationship was well-known and seemingly happy. Yet, there are whispers of a shadowy figure seen lurking near the inn on the night of her disappearance.\"\n\nHolmes steepled his fingers. \"Have you any suspects?\"\n\nBlackwood shook his head. \"None that the police have been able to identify. The villagers are tight-lipped, and fear seems to have gripped the community.\"\n\nWatson exchanged a glance with Holmes. \"It sounds like a case worthy of your attention, Holmes.\"\n\nHolmes nodded. \"Indeed. Mr. Blackwood, I shall accompany you to Little Hatherley at first light.\"\n\nThe following morning, Holmes, Watson, and Blackwood set out for the village. The journey was uneventful, but as they approached Little Hatherley, a palpable tension hung in the air. The village was small, with narrow lanes and thatched cottages, but the usual bustle of rural life was subdued.\n\nAt the inn, they were greeted by the innkeeper, Mrs. Thompson, a stout woman with a wary expression. \"You're here about Miss Carter, I presume?\" she asked.\n\nHolmes nodded. \"Yes, madam. We hope to learn what we can about her disappearance.\"\n\nMrs. Thompson led them to the common room. \"Emily was a sweet girl, always cheerful. The night she vanished, she left around ten o'clock after saying goodnight to the other guests. But after that, no one saw her.\"\n\nHolmes inquired about the shadowy figure. Mrs. Thompson hesitated. \"Some say they saw a man in a dark cloak near the woods, but no one knows who he was.\"\n\nHolmes and Watson decided to inspect the area around the inn and the nearby woods. As they walked, Holmes observed the footprints in the soft earth, noting their size and direction. \"These prints are fresh,\" he remarked. \"They lead towards the old mill on the edge of the village.\"\n\nThey followed the trail to the mill, a dilapidated structure long abandoned. Inside, they found signs of recent activity: a smoldering fire and discarded food wrappers. Holmes's keen eyes caught a scrap of fabric caught on a nail—a piece of Emily's distinctive shawl.\n\nSuddenly, a rustling sound came from the shadows. Holmes and Watson drew their revolvers as a figure emerged—a young man, disheveled and frightened.\n\n\"Who are you?\" Holmes demanded.\n\nThe man stammered, \"My name is Peter. I... I was looking for Emily. She promised to meet me here.\"\n\nHolmes's gaze sharpened. \"Why would she meet you in secret?\"\n\nPeter looked down. \"Because I am the son of the village blacksmith, and she feared her fiancé would not approve of our friendship.\"\n\nHolmes considered this. \"Where is Emily now?\"\n\nPeter shook his head. \"I don't know. She never came.\"\n\nHolmes motioned for Peter to accompany them back to the village. As they walked, Holmes pondered the complexities of the case—the vanished woman, the secret meetings, the shadowy figure.\n\nBack at the inn, Holmes requested to see Thomas Grey. The farmer was a burly man with a stern demeanor. \"I want to find Emily as much as anyone,\" he said gruffly. \"But I fear she has run off with that blacksmith's son.\"\n\nHolmes studied Thomas carefully. \"Is there any reason you would wish to harm her?\"\n\nThomas bristled. \"Of course not! But if she has betrayed me, I will not stand for it.\"\n\nHolmes nodded. \"We shall uncover the truth.\"\n\nThat night, Holmes and Watson kept watch near the woods. As the moon rose, a figure appeared—a man in a dark cloak, moving stealthily. Holmes signaled to Watson, and they followed at a distance.\n\nThe figure led them to a hidden cave beneath the cliffs. Inside, they found Emily Carter, alive but frightened. She explained that she had fled to escape an arranged marriage and sought refuge with Peter.\n\nHolmes confronted Thomas Grey, who confessed to threatening Emily to keep her from leaving. The villagers, relieved by the resolution, thanked Holmes and Watson.\n\nAs they departed Little Hatherley, Holmes reflected on the case. \"Sometimes, the greatest mysteries are not of crime, but of the human heart.\"\n\nWatson smiled. \"And you, Holmes, are the greatest detective of them all.\""

Some, too, have baffled his analytical skill, and would be, as narratives, beginnings without an ending, while others have been but partially cleared up, and have their explanations founded rather upon conjecture and surmise than on that absolute logical proof which was so dear to him. There is, however, one of these last which was so remarkable in its details and so startling in its results that I am tempted to give some account of it in spite of the fact that there are points in connection with it which never have been, and probably never will be, entirely cleared up.\nThe year ’87 furnished us with a long series of cases of greater or less interest, of which I retain the records. Among my headings under this one twelve months I find an account of the adventure of the Paradol Chamber, of the Amateur Mendicant Society, who held a luxurious club in the lower vault of a furniture warehouse, of the facts connected with the loss of the British barque Sophy Anderson, of the singular adventures of the Grice Patersons in the island of Uffa, and finally of the Camberwell poisoning case. In the latter, as may be remembered, Sherlock Holmes was able, by winding up the dead man’s watch, to prove that it had been wound up two hours before, and that therefore the deceased had gone to bed within that time—a deduction which was of the greatest importance in clearing up the case.

Some, indeed, have such a singular and dramatic interest that I am tempted to give them a place in these pages, even though they may not be of the first rank in point of intellectual difficulty. Others, again, are so intricate and involved that they would require a volume to themselves, and would be out of place in a brief collection. Yet, it is the very variety of these cases which makes the record so fascinating, for they show the wide range of human character and the endless ingenuity of crime.\n\nAmong the many adventures which I might relate, there is one which stands out for its curious combination of the commonplace and the extraordinary. It was in the early spring of 1887 that a young woman came to consult Holmes upon a matter which at first seemed trivial, but which soon unfolded into a mystery of the deepest interest. The case involved a missing heirloom, a secret message, and a series of events which led us through the foggy streets of London to the quiet lanes of the countryside.\n\nHolmes, with his usual keen eye for detail and his unparalleled powers of deduction, was able to unravel the tangled threads of the case with remarkable speed. His methods, though sometimes unorthodox, always led to the truth, and in this instance, the truth was stranger than fiction. The case not only tested his intellect but also revealed the depths of human passion and the lengths to which some will go to protect their secrets.\n\nAs I recount these adventures, I am reminded of the words of my friend: \"When you have eliminated the impossible, whatever remains, however improbable, must be the truth.\" It is this principle that guided us through the labyrinth of clues and red herrings, and it is this principle that I hope will guide the reader through the tales which follow."

As evening drew in, the storm grew higher and louder, and the wind cried and sobbed like a child in the chimney.

INACCURATE ELEMENTS:\n- The completion introduces inaccurate environmental details (e.g., gas lamps, dancing shadows) that are not in the original.\n- The dialogue is altered: Holmes’s response to Watson’s speculation about the visitor is changed, and the phrasing of their exchange is not faithful to the original sequence or tone.\n- The completion changes the wording and order of Holmes’s conjecture about the visitor, and the transition to the arrival of the guest is less precise.\n- The final invitation to the visitor is phrased differently from the original, altering the tone and formality of the moment."

The streets of London were drenched with rain, and the wind howled through the narrow alleys like a living thing. Sherlock Holmes and I were seated by the fire in our Baker Street lodgings, the flickering flames casting long shadows upon the walls. Holmes was deep in thought, his keen eyes fixed upon the dancing embers, while I busied myself with the morning paper.\n\nSuddenly, the door burst open, and a tall, gaunt man entered, his face pale and drawn with anxiety. \"Mr. Holmes,\" he exclaimed, \"I am in desperate need of your assistance.\"\n\nHolmes motioned him to sit, and the man introduced himself as Mr. John Openshaw. He proceeded to recount a most peculiar and troubling tale. Several years prior, his uncle had been found dead under mysterious circumstances, clutching a scrap of paper with the words \"The Speckled Band\" scrawled upon it. Since then, members of his family had been dying one by one, each under strange and inexplicable conditions.\n\nHolmes listened intently, his eyes narrowing as he pieced together the fragments of the story. \"This 'Speckled Band'—have you any idea what it might signify?\" he inquired.\n\n\"No, sir,\" replied Mr. Openshaw, \"but I fear it is connected to the deaths.\"\n\nHolmes rose abruptly. \"Watson, we must visit the estate at once. There is a mystery here that demands our immediate attention.\"\n\nAs we prepared to depart, I could not help but feel a thrill of anticipation. The game was afoot, and once more, we were plunged into the shadowy world of crime and intrigue that so fascinated my friend and companion."

It is a hereditary matter; so in order to give you an idea of the facts, I must go back to the commencement of the affair.\n“You must know that my grandfather had two sons—my uncle Elias and my father Joseph. My father had a small factory at Coventry, which he enlarged at the time of the invention of bicycling. He was a patentee of the Openshaw unbreakable tire, and his business met with such success that he was able to sell it and to retire upon a handsome competence.\n“My uncle Elias emigrated to America when he was a young man and became a planter in Florida, where he was reported to have done very well. At the time of the war he fought in Jackson’s army, and afterwards under Hood, where he rose to be a colonel. When Lee laid down his arms my uncle returned to his plantation, where he remained for three or four years. About 1869 or 1870 he came back to Europe and took a small estate in Sussex, near Horsham. He had made a very considerable fortune in the States, and his reason for leaving them was his aversion to the negroes, and his dislike of the Republican policy in extending the franchise to them. He was a singular man, fierce and quick-tempered, very foul-mouthed when he was angry, and of a most retiring disposition. During all the years that he lived at Horsham, I doubt if ever he set foot in the town. He had a garden and two or three fields round his house, and there he would take his exercise, though very often for weeks on end he would never leave his room. He drank a great deal of brandy and smoked very heavily, but he would see no society and did not want any friends, not even his own brother.\n“He didn’t mind me; in fact, he took a fancy to me, for at the time when he saw me first I was a youngster of twelve or so. This would be in the year 1878, after he had been eight or nine years in England. He begged my father to let me live with him and he was very kind to me in his way. When he was sober he used to be fond of playing backgammon and draughts with me, and he would make me his representative both with the servants and with the tradespeople, so that by the time that I was sixteen I was quite master of the house. I kept all the keys and could go where I liked and do what I liked, so long as I did not disturb him in his privacy. There was one singular exception, however, for he had a single room, a lumber-room up among the attics, which was invariably locked, and which he would never permit either me or anyone else to enter. With a boy’s curiosity I have peeped through the keyhole, but I was never able to see more than such a collection of old trunks and bundles as would be expected in such a room.",

The fire crackled and spat, casting flickering shadows across the room, which was otherwise dim and filled with the scent of damp earth and burning wood. He sighed deeply, the weight of the day's events pressing heavily upon his shoulders. Outside, the rain continued to fall in relentless sheets, drumming against the windowpanes and turning the streets into rivers.\n\nHe was a stranger in this part of London, having arrived only that morning with little more than a small bag and a heart full of hope. Yet, the city had greeted him with its usual indifference, and the cold had seeped into his bones despite the warmth of the fire. His thoughts drifted back to the letter he had received, the one that had brought him here—a plea for help from a friend long thought lost.\n\nAs he sat there, the door creaked open, and a tall figure stepped inside, shaking off the rain from his coat. The newcomer’s eyes were sharp and observant, taking in the room and its occupant with a practiced gaze. He removed his hat and hung it on a nearby hook before settling into a chair opposite the young man.\n\n\"I trust the journey was not too arduous?\" the visitor inquired, his voice calm and measured.\n\nThe young man nodded. \"The rain was relentless, but I managed. I am grateful for your hospitality.\"\n\n\"No need for thanks,\" the visitor replied. \"We have much to discuss, and time is of the essence.\"\n\nHe reached into his coat pocket and produced a small, folded piece of paper, which he handed across the table. The young man unfolded it carefully, revealing a hastily sketched map and a series of cryptic notes.\n\n\"This is what I have uncovered so far,\" the visitor explained. \"The case is more complex than it first appeared. There are layers of deception and danger that we must navigate with caution.\"\n\nThe young man studied the map, tracing the routes and landmarks with his finger. \"I see. And you believe the key lies here, in this district?\"\n\n\"Precisely,\" the visitor confirmed. \"But we must be discreet. There are eyes and ears everywhere, and not all are friendly.\"\n\nA sudden knock at the door interrupted their conversation. The visitor rose swiftly, moving to answer it. A woman entered, her expression grave and her eyes filled with urgency.\n\n\"I bring news,\" she said, her voice barely above a whisper. \"The situation has escalated. We have little time.\"\n\nThe visitor nodded, gesturing for her to join them. \"Then we must act quickly. The game is afoot, and every moment counts.\"\n\nTogether, the three of them poured over the details, formulating a plan to unravel the mystery that had brought them together. The fire continued to burn, its light a beacon against the encroaching darkness, as they prepared to face the challenges ahead with determination and resolve."

          "text_segment": "“One day—it was in March, 1883—a letter with a foreign stamp lay upon the table in front of the colonel’s plate. It was not a common thing for him to receive letters, for his bills were all paid in ready money, and he had no friends of any sort. ‘From India!’ said he as he took it up, ‘Pondicherry postmark! What can this be?’ Opening it hurriedly, out there jumped five little dried orange pips, which pattered down upon his plate. I began to laugh at this, but the laugh was struck from my lips at the sight of his face. His lip had fallen, his eyes were protruding, his skin the colour of putty, and he glared at the envelope which he still held in his trembling hand, ‘K. K. K.!’ he shrieked, and then, ‘My God, my God, my sins have overtaken me!’\n“‘What is it, uncle?’ I cried.\n“‘Death,’ said he, and rising from the table he retired to his room, leaving me palpitating with horror. I took up the envelope and saw scrawled in red ink upon the inner flap, just above the gum, the letter K three times repeated. There was nothing else save the five dried pips. What could be the reason of his overpowering terror? I left the breakfast-table, and as I ascended the stair I met him coming down with an old rusty key, which must have belonged to the attic, in one hand, and a small brass box, like a cashbox, in the other.\n“‘They may do what they like, but I’ll checkmate them still,’ said he with an oath. ‘Tell Mary that I shall want a fire in my room to-day, and send down to Fordham, the Horsham lawyer.’\n“I did as he ordered, and when the lawyer arrived I was asked to step up to the room. The fire was burning brightly, and in the grate there was a mass of black, fluffy ashes, as of burned paper, while the brass box stood open and empty beside it. As I glanced at the box I noticed, with a start, that upon the lid was printed the treble K which I had read in the morning upon the envelope.\n“‘I wish you, John,’ said my uncle, ‘to witness my will. I leave my estate, with all its advantages and all its disadvantages, to my brother, your father, whence it will, no doubt, descend to you. If you can enjoy it in peace, well and good! If you find you cannot, take my advice, my boy, and leave it to your deadliest enemy. I am sorry to give you such a two-edged thing, but I can’t say what turn things are going to take. Kindly sign the paper where Mr. Fordham shows you.’\n“I signed the paper as directed, and the lawyer took it away with him. The singular incident made, as you may think, the deepest impression upon me, and I pondered over it and turned it every way in my mind without being able to make anything of it. Yet I could not shake off the vague feeling of dread which it left behind, though the sensation grew less keen as the weeks passed and nothing happened to disturb the usual routine of our lives. I could see a change in my uncle, however. He drank more than ever, and he was less inclined for any sort of society. Most of his time he would spend in his room, with the door locked upon the inside, but sometimes he would emerge in a sort of drunken frenzy and would burst out of the house and tear about the garden with a revolver in his hand, screaming out that he was afraid of no man, and that he was not to be cooped up, like a sheep in a pen, by man or devil. When these hot fits were over, however, he would rush tumultuously in at the door and lock and bar it behind him, like a man who can brazen it out no longer against the terror which lies at the roots of his soul. At such times I have seen his face, even on a cold day, glisten with moisture, as though it were new raised from a basin.\n“Well, to come to an end of the matter, Mr. Holmes, and not to abuse your patience, there came a night when he made one of those drunken sallies from which he never came back. We found him, when we went to search for him, face downward in a little green-scummed pool, which lay at the foot of the garden. There was no sign of any violence, and the water was but two feet deep, so that the jury, having regard to his known eccentricity, brought in a verdict of ‘suicide.’ But I, who knew how he winced from the very thought of death, had much ado to persuade myself that he had gone out of his way to meet it. The matter passed, however, and my father entered into possession of the estate, and of some £ 14,000, which lay to his credit at the bank.”\n“One moment,” Holmes interposed, “your statement is, I foresee, one of the most remarkable to which I have ever listened. Let me have the date of the reception by your uncle of the letter, and the date of his supposed suicide.”\n“The letter arrived on March 10, 1883. His death was seven weeks later, upon the night of May 2nd.”\n“Thank you. Pray proceed.”",

            "prefix-probing": "It was a curious letter, for it bore no address, and the handwriting was strange and unfamiliar. The colonel, a man of keen observation and a mind sharpened by years of military service, picked it up with a puzzled frown. He turned it over, examining the seal, which was a curious emblem of a lion rampant, and then broke it open with a practiced hand.\n\nInside was a single sheet of paper, upon which was written a brief but urgent message:\n\n\"Dear Colonel,\n\nI write to you from the heart of the Balkans, where a matter of great importance has come to my attention. Your expertise and discretion are required at once. I cannot divulge more in this letter, but I implore you to meet me at the old mill by the river at midnight tomorrow. Come alone, and bring no one with you.\n\nYours in confidence,\n\nA Friend\"\n\nThe colonel's eyes narrowed as he read the note. The handwriting was unfamiliar, but the tone was unmistakably urgent. He glanced around the room, noting the curious glances of his guests, who had been gathered for a quiet dinner. The letter was addressed to him alone, and the foreign stamp suggested it had traveled some distance.\n\nAfter a moment's hesitation, the colonel folded the letter carefully and placed it in his breast pocket. \"Gentlemen,\" he said, rising from his seat, \"it appears I have a matter of some urgency to attend to. I must beg your pardon, but I shall have to take my leave early this evening.\"\n\nHis guests murmured their understanding, though curiosity was plainly written on their faces. The colonel donned his coat and hat, and with a nod to the butler, he stepped out into the chill March evening.\n\nThe streets were quiet as he made his way to the old mill, a dilapidated structure that had long been abandoned. The moon cast a pale light over the river, and the air was thick with the scent of damp earth and budding spring.\n\nAs he approached the mill, a shadow detached itself from the darkness. A tall figure stepped forward, cloaked and hooded, face obscured.\n\n\"Colonel,\" the figure said in a low voice, \"I am glad you came. Time is of the essence.\"\n\nThe colonel nodded, his hand instinctively moving to the revolver at his side. \"Who are you? And what is this matter that requires such secrecy?\"\n\nThe figure hesitated, then lowered the hood, revealing a woman with sharp eyes and a determined expression.\n\n\"My name is Elena,\" she said. \"I am an agent of the Crown, working undercover in these troubled lands. There is a plot afoot to destabilize the region, and it involves men of influence here in London. I have uncovered evidence that implicates several high-ranking officials in a conspiracy to smuggle arms and foment rebellion.\"\n\nThe colonel listened intently, the pieces beginning to fall into place. \"And you require my assistance to bring these men to justice?\"\n\nElena nodded. \"Yes. Your military experience and connections will be invaluable. But we must act swiftly and discreetly.\"\n\nTogether, they devised a plan to gather further evidence and expose the conspirators. Over the following days, the colonel and Elena met in secret, exchanging information and coordinating their efforts.\n\nTheir investigation led them through the shadowy underworld of espionage and political intrigue, where danger lurked at every turn. They encountered informants, double agents, and assassins, each step bringing them closer to the truth.\n\nOne evening, as they reviewed their findings in a secluded room, a sudden noise alerted them to an intruder. The door burst open, and a group of armed men stormed in, weapons drawn.\n\nThe colonel and Elena sprang into action, their training and quick reflexes allowing them to fend off the attackers. In the ensuing struggle, the leader of the assailants was unmasked—a man known to the colonel as a trusted government official.\n\nThe revelation confirmed the depth of the conspiracy and the stakes involved. With renewed determination, they pressed on, gathering the final pieces of evidence needed to bring the conspirators to justice.\n\nIn the end, their efforts culminated in a dramatic confrontation at the House of Commons, where the colonel presented the evidence before a stunned assembly. The conspirators were arrested, and the threat to the realm was averted.\n\nThe colonel and Elena parted ways, their mission complete but their bond forged in the crucible of danger and intrigue. As the spring sun rose over London, the city breathed a sigh of relief, unaware of the shadowy battle that had been waged to protect its future."

          "text_segment": "“When my father took over the Horsham property, he, at my request, made a careful examination of the attic, which had been always locked up. We found the brass box there, although its contents had been destroyed. On the inside of the cover was a paper label, with the initials of K. K. K. repeated upon it, and ‘Letters, memoranda, receipts, and a register’ written beneath. These, we presume, indicated the nature of the papers which had been destroyed by Colonel Openshaw. For the rest, there was nothing of much importance in the attic save a great many scattered papers and note-books bearing upon my uncle’s life in America. Some of them were of the war time and showed that he had done his duty well and had borne the repute of a brave soldier. Others were of a date during the reconstruction of the Southern states, and were mostly concerned with politics, for he had evidently taken a strong part in opposing the carpet-bag politicians who had been sent down from the North.\n“Well, it was the beginning of ’84 when my father came to live at Horsham, and all went as well as possible with us until the January of ’85. On the fourth day after the new year I heard my father give a sharp cry of surprise as we sat together at the breakfast-table. There he was, sitting with a newly opened envelope in one hand and five dried orange pips in the outstretched palm of the other one. He had always laughed at what he called my cock-and-bull story about the colonel, but he looked very scared and puzzled now that the same thing had come upon himself.\n“‘Why, what on earth does this mean, John?’ he stammered.\n“My heart had turned to lead. ‘It is K. K. K.,’ said I.\n“He looked inside the envelope. ‘So it is,’ he cried. ‘Here are the very letters. But what is this written above them?’\n“‘Put the papers on the sundial,’ I read, peeping over his shoulder.\n“‘What papers? What sundial?’ he asked.\n“‘The sundial in the garden. There is no other,’ said I; ‘but the papers must be those that are destroyed.’\n“‘Pooh!’ said he, gripping hard at his courage. ‘We are in a civilised land here, and we can’t have tomfoolery of this kind. Where does the thing come from?’\n“‘From Dundee,’ I answered, glancing at the postmark.\n“‘Some preposterous practical joke,’ said he. ‘What have I to do with sundials and papers? I shall take no notice of such nonsense.’\n“‘I should certainly speak to the police,’ I said.\n“‘And be laughed at for my pains. Nothing of the sort.’\n“‘Then let me do so?’\n“‘No, I forbid you. I won’t have a fuss made about such nonsense.’\n“It was in vain to argue with him, for he was a very obstinate man. I went about, however, with a heart which was full of forebodings.\n“On the third day after the coming of the letter my father went from home to visit an old friend of his, Major Freebody, who is in command of one of the forts upon Portsdown Hill. I was glad that he should go, for it seemed to me that he was farther from danger when he was away from home. In that, however, I was in error. Upon the second day of his absence I received a telegram from the major, imploring me to come at once. My father had fallen over one of the deep chalk-pits which abound in the neighbourhood, and was lying senseless, with a shattered skull. I hurried to him, but he passed away without having ever recovered his consciousness. He had, as it appears, been returning from Fareham in the twilight, and as the country was unknown to him, and the chalk-pit unfenced, the jury had no hesitation in bringing in a verdict of ‘death from accidental causes.’ Carefully as I examined every fact connected with his death, I was unable to find anything which could suggest the idea of murder. There were no signs of violence, no footmarks, no robbery, no record of strangers having been seen upon the roads. And yet I need not tell you that my mind was far from at ease, and that I was well-nigh certain that some foul plot had been woven round him.\n“In this sinister way I came into my inheritance. You will ask me why I did not dispose of it? I answer, because I was well convinced that our troubles were in some way dependent upon an incident in my uncle’s life, and that the danger would be as pressing in one house as in another.",

                "text": "“When my father took over the Horsham property, he, at my request, made a careful examination of the attic, which had been always locked up. In that room he found a large number of papers and note-books scattered about in great disorder. Among these were many relating to my uncle’s life in America. The brass box which had borne the initials ‘K.K.K.’ was empty, but inside was a label which indicated that the letters, memoranda, receipts, and a register which it had contained had been destroyed. This I took to mean that the papers had been deliberately destroyed, for the label was still there, though the contents were gone.\n\nSome of the papers related to my uncle’s creditable service during the war, while others concerned the period of reconstruction, during which he had taken a prominent part in opposing certain politicians in the South. My father moved to Horsham at the beginning of 1884, and all went well until the January of 1885.\n\nOn the morning of the 4th of January, while at breakfast, my father suddenly cried out in surprise, holding in his hand an envelope which he had just opened. Five orange pips fell out upon the table. Though he had previously treated my story of the Colonel with some incredulity, I saw that his face had changed, and that he looked frightened.\n\nI took the envelope from him and read the initials ‘K.K.K.’ upon it. Above these was a message in pencil: ‘Put the papers on the sundial.’ I asked him which papers and which sundial were meant, and I suggested the sundial in the garden and the papers which had been destroyed. But he laughed bitterly and said it was all tomfoolery from Dundee. He refused to have the police called in, for fear of ridicule, and forbade me from communicating with them on the matter.\n\nI was deeply troubled, but could do nothing. Three days later, my father went to visit an old friend, Major Freebody, who was in command of a fort at Portsdown Hill. I was glad that he was away from home, thinking that he would be safer, but my relief was short-lived.\n\nOn the second day of his absence, I received a telegram from the Major, urging me to come at once. My father had fallen into a deep chalk-pit near Fareham while returning in the twilight. The pit was unfenced, and the country unfamiliar to him. He was found senseless with a shattered skull and never regained consciousness.\n\nThe jury, after a careful inquiry, brought in a verdict of death from accidental causes without hesitation. I searched the scene myself, but found no evidence of violence, no footmarks, no sign of robbery, and no strangers had been seen in the neighborhood. Yet I was convinced that my father had been the victim of a foul plot.\n\nI inherited the estate, and I have kept it, for I believe that the danger which threatened my uncle and my father would follow me wherever I might go, and that it would be as pressing in another house as in this.”",
                "refinement_prompt": "IMPROVEMENT GUIDANCE:\n1. MAJOR STRUCTURAL ISSUES:\n- The completion omits the explicit mention of the attic containing a large number of scattered papers and note-books, and does not specify that these were related to the uncle’s life in America, including the distinction between war-time and reconstruction-era documents.\n- The transition between the discovery in the attic and the move to Horsham is somewhat compressed, lacking the clear separation of these events as in the original.\n\n2. MISSING ELEMENTS:\n- The completion does not include the presumption that the destroyed papers were indicated by the label inside the brass box, nor does it mention the reasoning behind this presumption.\n- There is no mention of the uncle’s reputation as a brave soldier, nor the detail that some papers were specifically from the war and others from the reconstruction period, with a focus on political opposition to certain groups.\n- The completion omits the specific date reference to \"the beginning of '84\" and the detail that all went well until \"the January of '85.\"\n- The sequence of the father’s reaction to the envelope and pips is slightly condensed, missing the dialogue exchange that shows his initial skepticism turning to fear.\n- The completion does not include the back-and-forth dialogue about the sundial and the destroyed papers, nor the father's insistence on not contacting the police and forbidding his son from doing so.\n- The narrator’s emotional state and sense of foreboding after being forbidden to contact the police is not as clearly articulated.\n- The completion omits the detail that the father was visiting an old friend, Major Freebody, who is in command of a fort, and does not specify the location as Portsdown Hill.\n- The telegram from the major is mentioned, but the urgency and the fact that the father was found senseless with a shattered skull is not as detailed.\n- The completion does not specify that the father was returning from Fareham in the twilight, nor that the chalk-pit was unfenced and the country unfamiliar to him.\n- The jury’s verdict is summarized but lacks the detail that there was no hesitation in bringing in a verdict of accidental death.\n- The narrator’s careful examination for evidence of murder is mentioned, but the specific absence of violence, footmarks, robbery, or strangers is not itemized.\n- The narrator’s unease and near-certainty of a plot is present, but the phraseology and intensity are less pronounced.\n- The rationale for not disposing of the inheritance is summarized, but the reasoning that the danger would be as pressing in another house is not as explicit.\n\n3. INACCURATE ELEMENTS:\n- The completion sometimes condenses or paraphrases events, which leads to a loss of the original’s step-by-step progression, especially in the transition from the attic discovery to the events at Horsham.\n- The sequence of the father’s reaction to the letter and the subsequent discussion about the sundial and police is not as clearly delineated, potentially leading to confusion about the order of events.\n- The completion introduces a slight shift in perspective by summarizing the narrator’s feelings and decisions, rather than presenting them as direct reflections or dialogue as in the original.\n- The description of the father’s accident is less detailed, omitting the specific circumstances and the jury’s reasoning.\n- The completion does not invent new scenes, but it does generalize or compress several exchanges and details, which reduces the fidelity to the original structure and pacing."

            "prefix-probing": "When my father took over the Horsham property, he, at my request, made a careful examination of the attic, which had been always locked up. The old house, with its many secrets and shadows, seemed to hold more than just the dust of years. The attic was a place of mystery, and I was determined to uncover what lay hidden there.\n\nUpon entering, we found the room filled with old trunks, cobwebbed furniture, and a thick layer of dust covering everything. Among the relics of the past, my father discovered a small, locked box. The lock was rusted but still intact. With some effort, he managed to open it, revealing a collection of letters and a faded photograph.\n\nThe letters were addressed to a woman named Violet Hunter, and they spoke of a secret engagement and a promise to meet again. The photograph was of a young woman, strikingly beautiful, with eyes that seemed to hold a story of their own. I recognized her immediately from the descriptions I had heard in the village—the same Violet Hunter who had recently come to seek help from Mr. Sherlock Holmes.\n\nAs we read through the letters, it became clear that Violet had been involved in a complicated affair, one that had led her to the doorstep of danger. The letters hinted at a man named Mr. Rucastle, a figure shrouded in mystery and menace. It was evident that Violet had been trying to escape his grasp, and the attic held the key to understanding the full extent of her plight.\n\nDetermined to get to the bottom of the matter, I took the letters to Mr. Holmes, who listened intently as I recounted the story. His keen eyes sparkled with interest, and he immediately set to work, piecing together the clues with his usual brilliance.\n\nHolmes deduced that the locked attic had been used to imprison Violet, and that the letters were her only means of communicating her distress. The photograph, he noted, was a vital piece of evidence, linking her to the case and providing a face to the name.\n\nWith Holmes's guidance, we returned to the Horsham property, where he conducted a thorough investigation. He examined the locks, the windows, and the surrounding grounds, searching for any sign of foul play. His meticulous approach soon uncovered a hidden passage leading from the attic to the outside, a secret escape route that had been cleverly concealed.\n\nThe discovery of the passage confirmed Holmes's suspicions that Violet had been held against her will and had managed to escape through this hidden way. Further inquiries revealed that Mr. Rucastle had been attempting to keep her confined to protect a dark secret related to the family estate.\n\nHolmes's investigation brought to light the truth behind the mysterious events at Horsham, and justice was served. Violet was freed from her torment, and the shadow that had hung over the estate was lifted.\n\nReflecting on the ordeal, I realized the importance of vigilance and the power of determination. The attic, once a place of fear and uncertainty, had become the key to unraveling a tangled web of deceit. Thanks to the sharp mind of Sherlock Holmes and the courage of those involved, the truth had prevailed, and peace was restored to Horsham."

During that time I have lived happily at Horsham, and I had begun to hope that this curse had passed away from the family, and that it had ended with the last generation. I had begun to take comfort too soon, however; yesterday morning the blow fell in the very shape in which it had come upon my father.”\nThe young man took from his waistcoat a crumpled envelope, and turning to the table he shook out upon it five little dried orange pips.\n“This is the envelope,” he continued. “The postmark is London—eastern division. Within are the very words which were upon my father’s last message: ‘K. K. K.’; and then ‘Put the papers on the sundial.’”\n“What have you done?” asked Holmes.\n“Nothing.”\n“Nothing?”\n“To tell the truth”—he sank his face into his thin, white hands—“I have felt helpless. I have felt like one of those poor rabbits when the snake is writhing towards it. I seem to be in the grasp of some resistless, inexorable evil, which no foresight and no precautions can guard against.”\n“Tut! tut!” cried Sherlock Holmes. “You must act, man, or you are lost. Nothing but energy can save you. This is no time for despair.”\n“I have seen the police.”\n“Ah!”\n“But they listened to my story with a smile. I am convinced that the inspector has formed the opinion that the letters are all practical jokes, and that the deaths of my relations were really accidents, as the jury stated, and were not to be connected with the warnings.”\nHolmes shook his clenched hands in the air. “Incredible imbecility!” he cried.\n“They have, however, allowed me a policeman, who may remain in the house with me.”\n“Has he come with you to-night?”\n“No. His orders were to stay in the house.”\nAgain Holmes raved in the air.\n“Why did you come to me?” he said, “and, above all, why did you not come at once?”\n“I did not know. It was only to-day that I spoke to Major Prendergast about my troubles and was advised by him to come to you.”\n“It is really two days since you had the letter. We should have acted before this. You have no further evidence, I suppose, than that which you have placed before us—no suggestive detail which might help us?”\n“There is one thing,” said John Openshaw. He rummaged in his coat pocket, and, drawing out a piece of discoloured, blue-tinted paper, he laid it out upon the table. “I have some remembrance,” said he, “that on the day when my uncle burned the papers I observed that the small, unburned margins which lay amid the ashes were of this particular colour. I found this single sheet upon the floor of his room, and I am inclined to think that it may be one of the papers which has, perhaps, fluttered out from among the others, and in that way has escaped destruction. Beyond the mention of pips, I do not see that it helps us much. I think myself that it is a page from some private diary. The writing is undoubtedly my uncle’s.”\nHolmes moved the lamp, and we both bent over the sheet of paper, which showed by its ragged edge that it had indeed been torn from a book. It was headed, “March, 1869,” and beneath were the following enigmatical notices:\n“4th. Hudson came. Same old platform.\n“7th. Set the pips on McCauley, Paramore, and John Swain of St. Augustine.\n“9th. McCauley cleared.\n“10th. John Swain cleared.\n“12th. Visited Paramore. All well.”",

Father had been summoned to a meeting at a secluded estate on the outskirts of the city, a place shrouded in secrecy and whispered rumors. He left with a determined look in his eyes, a resolve that I had seldom seen before. That was the last time I saw him alive.\n\nIn the days that followed, the official reports spoke of an accident—a fall from a great height, they said. But I knew better. The signs were all there: the absence of any witnesses, the strange behavior of those who had been present, and the subtle but unmistakable traces of foul play. I was convinced that my father had been murdered, silenced for reasons that were yet to be uncovered.\n\nIt was then that I sought the assistance of Mr. Sherlock Holmes, the renowned detective whose reputation for unraveling the most perplexing mysteries was unmatched. I had heard of his keen intellect and his uncanny ability to see what others could not. Desperate for answers, I turned to him, hoping that he could shed light on the dark shadows that had enveloped my family.\n\nHolmes listened intently as I recounted the events leading up to my father’s death. His piercing eyes never wavered, absorbing every detail with meticulous care. When I finished, he leaned back in his chair, steepling his fingers thoughtfully.\n\n\"Watson,\" he said, \"this case is fraught with complexities, but I believe we can uncover the truth. The key lies in understanding the motives of those who stood to gain from your father’s silence.\"\n\nTogether, we began to piece together the puzzle. We delved into my father’s correspondences, his recent acquaintances, and the nature of the secret he had been guarding. Each clue brought us closer to a revelation that was as shocking as it was inevitable.\n\nOne evening, as the gas lamps flickered outside our window, Holmes revealed his findings. \"Your father was on the verge of exposing a conspiracy that threatened the very fabric of our society. His death was orchestrated to prevent this exposure.\"\n\nThe weight of his words settled heavily upon me. Yet, amidst the sorrow, there was a glimmer of hope. With Holmes by my side, I was determined to see justice served and to honor my father’s memory by bringing the truth to light.\n\nOur investigation led us through the labyrinthine streets of London, from the opulent drawing rooms of the aristocracy to the grimy back alleys where secrets festered. Along the way, we encountered danger and deception, but also unexpected allies who shared our quest for justice.\n\nIn the end, it was Holmes’s unparalleled deductive skills that unraveled the conspiracy. The culprits were brought to justice, and the truth was laid bare for all to see. Though my father’s life was cut short, his legacy endured, a testament to courage and integrity in the face of darkness.\n\nAs I reflect on those harrowing days, I am reminded of the profound impact one man can have, even in death. My father’s story is one of sacrifice and resilience, and it is a story that I am honored to share, with the hope that it may inspire others to seek truth and justice, no matter the cost."

And, above all, take care of yourself in the meanwhile, for I do not think that there can be a doubt that you are threatened by a very real and imminent danger.

And yet you cannot guard yourself too closely.”\n“I am armed.”\n“That is well. To-morrow I shall set to work upon your case.”\n“I shall see you at Horsham, then?”\n“No, your secret lies in London. It is there that I shall seek it.”\n“Then I shall call upon you in a day, or in two days, with news as to the box and the papers.

            "prefix-probing": "“Thank you!” said Holmes, folding up the paper and returning it to our visitor. “This will be of great assistance in our inquiries.”\n\nThe man, a tall, gaunt figure with a nervous twitch about his left eye, nodded gratefully. “I am at your service, Mr. Holmes. I only wish I had come to you sooner.”\n\nHolmes smiled faintly. “Better late than never, my friend. Now, please, tell me everything you know about the matter.”\n\nHe settled back into his chair, steepling his fingers as he listened intently. The visitor began to recount the strange events that had led him to seek our help—a series of mysterious disappearances in the quiet village of Little Hangleton, where he had recently taken up residence.\n\n“People have been vanishing without a trace,” he explained. “No signs of struggle, no clues left behind. The local constabulary is baffled, and the villagers are growing fearful.”\n\nHolmes’s eyes gleamed with interest. “And you believe these disappearances are connected?”\n\n“Indeed. There is talk of a curse, but I suspect something more tangible.”\n\nI glanced at Holmes, noting the familiar spark of excitement in his gaze. This was the kind of puzzle that thrilled him—the interplay of human nature and the art of deduction.\n\n“Have you noticed any patterns?” Holmes inquired.\n\n“Each disappearance occurred on a foggy night, near the old mill on the outskirts of the village.”\n\nHolmes nodded thoughtfully. “The fog may provide cover for the perpetrator. We must visit this mill at once.”\n\nWithout delay, we gathered our coats and set out into the misty evening. The village was eerily silent, the usual sounds of nocturnal life muted beneath the heavy shroud of fog.\n\nAs we approached the mill, a faint light flickered within. Holmes motioned for silence and crept forward, his keen eyes scanning the surroundings.\n\nSuddenly, a shadow moved across the window. Holmes signaled for me to follow as he slipped inside through a side door left ajar.\n\nInside, the air was thick with dust and the scent of damp wood. We could hear muffled voices coming from the upper floor.\n\nHolmes led the way up the creaking stairs, his footsteps light and deliberate. At the top, we found a small room where a group of men huddled around a table, their faces obscured by the dim light.\n\nHolmes stepped forward boldly. “Gentlemen, I believe you have some explaining to do.”\n\nThe men startled, reaching for weapons, but Holmes’s commanding presence and quick reflexes kept them at bay.\n\n“Release the captives,” he demanded.\n\nFrom the shadows emerged several villagers, bound but unharmed. The men had been kidnapping them for ransom, exploiting the fog to conceal their crimes.\n\nWith the mystery unraveled, the local authorities were summoned, and the culprits apprehended. The village of Little Hangleton could finally breathe easy once more.\n\nAs we returned to Baker Street, Holmes reflected, “It is often the simplest explanation, Watson, that holds the key. A foggy night, a secluded mill, and human greed—ingredients for a tale as old as time.”\n\nI nodded, grateful to have witnessed yet another triumph of deduction and justice at the hands of my remarkable friend."

Then he lit his pipe, and leaning back in his chair he watched the blue smoke-rings as they chased each other up to the ceiling.\n“I think, Watson,” he remarked at last, “that of all our cases we have had none more fantastic than this.”\n“Save, perhaps, the Sign of Four.”\n“Well, yes. Save, perhaps, that. And yet this John Openshaw seems to me to be walking amid even greater perils than did the Sholtos.”\n“But have you,” I asked, “formed any definite conception as to what these perils are?”\n“There can be no question as to their nature,” he answered.\n“Then what are they? Who is this K. K. K., and why does he pursue this unhappy family?”\nSherlock Holmes closed his eyes and placed his elbows upon the arms of his chair, with his finger-tips together. “The ideal reasoner,” he remarked, “would, when he had once been shown a single fact in all its bearings, deduce from it not only all the chain of events which led up to it but also all the results which would follow from it. As Cuvier could correctly describe a whole animal by the contemplation of a single bone, so the observer who has thoroughly understood one link in a series of incidents should be able to accurately state all the other ones, both before and after. We have not yet grasped the results which the reason alone can attain to. Problems may be solved in the study which have baffled all those who have sought a solution by the aid of their senses. To carry the art, however, to its highest pitch, it is necessary that the reasoner should be able to utilise all the facts which have come to his knowledge; and this in itself implies, as you will readily see, a possession of all knowledge, which, even in these days of free education and encyclopædias, is a somewhat rare accomplishment. It is not so impossible, however, that a man should possess all knowledge which is likely to be useful to him in his work, and this I have endeavoured in my case to do. If I remember rightly, you on one occasion, in the early days of our friendship, defined my limits in a very precise fashion.”\n“Yes,” I answered, laughing. “It was a singular document. Philosophy, astronomy, and politics were marked at zero, I remember. Botany variable, geology profound as regards the mud-stains from any region within fifty miles of town, chemistry eccentric, anatomy unsystematic, sensational literature and crime records unique, violin-player, boxer, swordsman, lawyer, and self-poisoner by cocaine and tobacco. Those, I think, were the main points of my analysis.”\nHolmes grinned at the last item. “Well,” he said, “I say now, as I said then, that a man should keep his little brain-attic stocked with all the furniture that he is likely to use, and the rest he can put away in the lumber-room of his library, where he can get it if he wants it. Now, for such a case as the one which has been submitted to us to-night, we need certainly to muster all our resources. Kindly hand me down the letter K of the American Encyclopædia which stands upon the shelf beside you. Thank you. Now let us consider the situation and see what may be deduced from it. In the first place, we may start with a strong presumption that Colonel Openshaw had some very strong reason for leaving America. Men at his time of life do not change all their habits and exchange willingly the charming climate of Florida for the lonely life of an English provincial town. His extreme love of solitude in England suggests the idea that he was in fear of someone or something, so we may assume as a working hypothesis that it was fear of someone or something which drove him from America. As to what it was he feared, we can only deduce that by considering the formidable letters which were received by himself and his successors. Did you remark the postmarks of those letters?”\n“The first was from Pondicherry, the second from Dundee, and the third from London.”\n“From East London. What do you deduce from that?”\n“They are all seaports. That the writer was on board of a ship.”\n“Excellent. We have already a clue. There can be no doubt that the probability—the strong probability—is that the writer was on board of a ship. And now let us consider another point. In the case of Pondicherry, seven weeks elapsed between the threat and its fulfilment, in Dundee it was only some three or four days. Does that suggest anything?”\n“A greater distance to travel.”\n“But the letter had also a greater distance to come.”\n“Then I do not see the point.”\n“There is at least a presumption that the vessel in which the man or men are is a sailing-ship. It looks as if they always send their singular warning or token before them when starting upon their mission. You see how quickly the deed followed the sign when it came from Dundee. If they had come from Pondicherry in a steamer they would have arrived almost as soon as their letter. But, as a matter of fact, seven weeks elapsed. I think that those seven weeks represented the difference between the mail-boat which brought the letter and the sailing vessel which brought the writer.”\n“It is possible.”\n“More than that. It is probable. And now you see the deadly urgency of this new case, and why I urged young Openshaw to caution. The blow has always fallen at the end of the time which it would take the senders to travel the distance. But this one comes from London, and therefore we cannot count upon delay.”\n“Good God!” I cried. “What can it mean, this relentless persecution?”\n“The papers which Openshaw carried are obviously of vital importance to the person or persons in the sailing-ship. I think that it is quite clear that there must be more than one of them. A single man could not have carried out two deaths in such a way as to deceive a coroner’s jury. There must have been several in it, and they must have been men of resource and determination. Their papers they mean to have, be the holder of them who it may. In this way you see K. K. K. ceases to be the initials of an individual and becomes the badge of a society.”\n“But of what society?”\n“Have you never—” said Sherlock Holmes, bending forward and sinking his voice—“have you never heard of the Ku Klux Klan?”",

            "prefix-probing": "Sherlock Holmes sat for some time in silence, with his head sunk forward and his eyes bent upon the red glow of the fire. The flickering flames cast long shadows upon the walls of the room, creating an atmosphere thick with anticipation and unspoken thoughts. At last, he raised his head and looked across at me, his keen eyes gleaming with a mixture of excitement and determination.\n\n\"Watson,\" he began, his voice low and measured, \"the case before us is unlike any we have encountered. The subtlety of the criminal's methods and the complexity of the clues demand our utmost attention and ingenuity.\"\n\nI nodded, eager to assist in unraveling the mystery that had so captivated my friend. Holmes continued, \"The key lies in understanding the motives and the means, as well as the peculiar circumstances surrounding the disappearance of Miss Violet Hunter.\"\n\nI recalled the details of the case: a young governess who had sought Holmes's help after encountering strange occurrences at her employer's estate. The enigmatic Mr. Rucastle had aroused suspicion, and the sudden vanishing of Miss Hunter had only deepened the intrigue.\n\nHolmes rose from his chair and began to pace the room, his fingers steepled beneath his chin. \"The first step,\" he mused, \"is to examine the physical evidence left behind. The torn letter, the footprints in the garden, the faint scent of tobacco—all these are threads in the tapestry we must weave.\"\n\nHe paused by the window, peering out into the night. \"The darkness conceals many secrets, Watson, but it also reveals the character of those who move within it. We must be vigilant and perceptive.\"\n\nI felt a surge of admiration for Holmes's relentless pursuit of truth. His mind was a labyrinth of logic and deduction, capable of piercing through the most impenetrable veils of deception.\n\nSuddenly, a knock at the door interrupted our reverie. Mrs. Hudson entered, bearing a telegram. Holmes took it with a swift motion, his eyes scanning the contents rapidly.\n\n\"An urgent message from Inspector Lestrade,\" he announced. \"It appears that new developments have arisen in the case of the Baskerville estate.\"\n\nMy heart quickened at the mention of the Baskervilles, a case that had already tested our resolve and ingenuity. Holmes unfolded the telegram and read aloud:\n\n\"'Dear Mr. Holmes, urgent assistance required at Baskerville Hall. Strange occurrences and unexplained phenomena reported. Your expertise is indispensable.\"\n\nHolmes folded the telegram and turned to me. \"Watson, it seems our respite is over. We must prepare to depart at once. The moor awaits, and with it, the shadows of a mystery that threatens to engulf us all.\"\n\nI gathered my belongings, my mind racing with anticipation and a hint of apprehension. The journey to Baskerville Hall promised to be fraught with danger and revelation.\n\nAs we stepped into the night, the chill air seemed to whisper secrets of the past and portents of the future. Holmes's silhouette was resolute against the moonlit sky, a beacon of reason amidst the encroaching darkness.\n\nThe train ride was swift, and upon arrival, we were greeted by the somber visage of Dr. Mortimer, whose concern for his friends was palpable.\n\n\"Mr. Holmes, Dr. Watson,\" he said gravely, \"the legend of the Hound has cast a pall over the estate. Strange howls echo across the moor, and the family is gripped by fear.\"\n\nHolmes listened intently, his mind already piecing together the fragments of the puzzle. \"Fear, Dr. Mortimer, is often the greatest adversary in any investigation. We shall confront it with reason and resolve.\"\n\nOur days at Baskerville Hall were filled with observation and inquiry. Holmes's keen eye missed nothing—the footprints in the damp earth, the peculiar behavior of the servants, the cryptic messages scrawled in the margins of old books.\n\nOne evening, as the fog rolled in thick and heavy, we ventured onto the moor. The eerie silence was broken only by the distant howl of a creature unseen.\n\nHolmes's voice was barely above a whisper. \"The hound is a legend, Watson, but legends often have roots in reality. We must uncover the truth behind the myth.\"\n\nSuddenly, a flash of light illuminated the darkness—a spectral figure bounding across the heath. My heart pounded as I realized the danger that lurked in the shadows.\n\nHolmes sprang into action, his deductions swift and precise. \"This is no supernatural beast, but a man using fear as a weapon. We must find the source of this deception.\"\n\nThrough tireless investigation, we uncovered a web of greed, jealousy, and revenge. The true culprit was unmasked, and the legend of the Hound was laid to rest.\n\nAs dawn broke over the moor, I reflected on the adventure we had shared. Holmes's brilliance had once again illuminated the darkness, proving that reason and courage could triumph over fear and superstition.\n\nReturning to Baker Street, I felt a renewed sense of purpose and admiration for my friend. The cases we had solved were more than mere puzzles—they were tests of character and intellect.\n\nHolmes settled back into his chair, a faint smile playing upon his lips. \"Watson,\" he said, \"the game is afoot, and there will always be mysteries to unravel. But for now, we may rest, knowing that justice has prevailed.\"\n\nI nodded, grateful for the companionship and the endless pursuit of truth that defined our partnership. The fire crackled softly, casting a warm glow over the room as the night deepened around us."

A name derived from the fanciful resemblance to the sound produced by cocking a rifle. This terrible secret society was formed by some ex-Confederate soldiers in the Southern states after the Civil War, and it rapidly formed local branches in different parts of the country, notably in Tennessee, Louisiana, the Carolinas, Georgia, and Florida. Its power was used for political purposes, principally for the terrorising of the negro voters and the murdering and driving from the country of those who were opposed to its views. Its outrages were usually preceded by a warning sent to the marked man in some fantastic but generally recognised shape—a sprig of oak-leaves in some parts, melon seeds or orange pips in others. On receiving this the victim might either openly abjure his former ways, or might fly from the country. If he braved the matter out, death would unfailingly come upon him, and usually in some strange and unforeseen manner. So perfect was the organisation of the society, and so systematic its methods, that there is hardly a case upon record where any man succeeded in braving it with impunity, or in which any of its outrages were traced home to the perpetrators. For some years the organisation flourished in spite of the efforts of the United States government and of the better classes of the community in the South. Eventually, in the year 1869, the movement rather suddenly collapsed, although there have been sporadic outbreaks of the same sort since that date.’\n“You will observe,” said Holmes, laying down the volume, “that the sudden breaking up of the society was coincident with the disappearance of Openshaw from America with their papers. It may well have been cause and effect. It is no wonder that he and his family have some of the more implacable spirits upon their track. You can understand that this register and diary may implicate some of the first men in the South, and that there may be many who will not sleep easy at night until it is recovered.”\n“Then the page we have seen—”\n“Is such as we might expect. It ran, if I remember right, ‘sent the pips to A, B, and C’—that is, sent the society’s warning to them. Then there are successive entries that A and B cleared, or left the country, and finally that C was visited, with, I fear, a sinister result for C. Well, I think, Doctor, that we may let some light into this dark place, and I believe that the only chance young Openshaw has in the meantime is to do what I have told him. There is nothing more to be said or to be done to-night, so hand me over my violin and let us try to forget for half an hour the miserable weather and the still more miserable ways of our fellow men.”",

            "prefix-probing": "“I never have,” said Holmes, with a smile. “But the case of the Speckled Band is one that has always fascinated me. It is a singular example of the ingenuity and cunning that can be employed in the commission of a crime.”\n\nDr. Watson leaned forward, his interest piqued. “Pray, tell me more, Holmes. What was the nature of this peculiar case?”\n\nHolmes settled back in his chair, his eyes gleaming with the thrill of the tale. “It began with a visit from a young lady named Helen Stoner, who was in great distress. She came to me at Baker Street, seeking help to unravel the mystery surrounding the death of her sister, Julia.”\n\n“Julia had died under strange circumstances at their family estate, Stoke Moran. The doctors were baffled, and the local authorities had no explanation. Helen feared for her own life, as she had begun to hear the same eerie whistle that Julia had reported before her demise.”\n\n“Indeed,” Holmes continued, “the case was marked by several curious details. The old manor was a gloomy place, with barred windows and a locked room that had not been opened for years. The stepfather, Dr. Grimesby Roylott, was a man of violent temper and strange habits, known for his interest in exotic animals and his knowledge of poisons.”\n\n“Holmes, how did you proceed with your investigation?” asked Watson.\n\n“I accompanied Miss Stoner to Stoke Moran,” Holmes replied. “We examined the room where Julia had died, noting the peculiar bell-pull that did not seem to function, the ventilator connecting to the adjoining room, and the bed clamped to the floor. These details suggested a hidden mechanism at work.”\n\n“On the night of our vigil, we observed the source of the deadly threat: a venomous swamp adder, the 'speckled band' of the title, which Dr. Roylott had trained to kill. The snake was sent through the ventilator, down the bell-pull, and onto the bed, where it bit Julia, causing her death.”\n\n“Holmes’s quick thinking led to the destruction of the snake, and the apprehension of the villain. The case was a testament to the dangers that can lurk behind closed doors and the importance of keen observation and deductive reasoning.”\n\nWatson nodded appreciatively. “Truly, Holmes, your methods are unparalleled. The Speckled Band remains one of your most remarkable cases.”\n\nHolmes smiled modestly. “It is the peculiarities of human nature and the complexities of crime that make our work endlessly fascinating, my dear Watson.”"

It is conjectured that he may have been hurrying down to catch the last train from Waterloo Station, and that in his haste and the extreme darkness he missed his path and walked over the edge of one of the small landing-places for river steamboats. The body exhibited no traces of violence, and there can be no doubt that the deceased had been the victim of an unfortunate accident, which should have the effect of calling the attention of the authorities to the condition of the riverside landing-stages.’”\nWe sat in silence for some minutes, Holmes more depressed and shaken than I had ever seen him.\n“That hurts my pride, Watson,” he said at last. “It is a petty feeling, no doubt, but it hurts my pride.

Holmes was more shaken than I had ever seen him. At last he said, \"My pride is hurt. It is a petty feeling, but this case has become personal. I shall, health permitting, bring the gang to justice. Openshaw came to us for help, and we sent him to his death.\"\n\nHe sprang from his chair and paced the room with agitation. His face flushed, and he clasped his hands behind his back. \"How did those cunning devils lure him to the Embankment? It was not on his direct route to Waterloo station. But I shall win in the long run. I am going out now. I shall be my own police force, and I shall only call in the official police when my web is spun.\"",

            "prefix-probing": "It had cleared in the morning, and the sun was shining with a subdued brightness through the dim veil which hangs over the great city. The streets were already bustling with the usual crowd of early risers, the clatter of horse-drawn cabs mingling with the distant cries of street vendors. Sherlock Holmes and I had just concluded our breakfast at 221B Baker Street when a sharp rap at the door announced the arrival of a visitor.\n\nMrs. Hudson ushered in a tall, thin man with a nervous demeanor and a pale complexion. He introduced himself as Mr. John Openshaw, a gentleman of some standing who had come to seek Holmes's assistance in a matter of grave concern. His eyes darted anxiously about the room as he recounted the peculiar circumstances that had brought him to our door.\n\nMr. Openshaw explained that his family had been plagued by a series of mysterious deaths, each more baffling than the last. His great-uncle, Elias Openshaw, had vanished without a trace several years prior, leaving behind a cryptic note that hinted at a terrible secret. Since then, other members of the family had met untimely ends under circumstances that defied explanation.\n\nHolmes listened intently, his keen eyes narrowing as he absorbed every detail. He asked probing questions about the family history, the nature of the deaths, and any possible motives or suspects. Mr. Openshaw revealed that the family estate, Lafter Hall, was situated in a remote part of the countryside, surrounded by dense woods and shrouded in local superstition.\n\nIntrigued by the case, Holmes agreed to accompany Mr. Openshaw to Lafter Hall to investigate further. We set out that very afternoon, the city gradually giving way to rolling hills and verdant fields as we traveled by train and carriage. Upon arrival, we were greeted by the somber household staff and the remaining family members, all of whom bore the weight of recent tragedies.\n\nHolmes immediately set about examining the scene, his methodical approach revealing subtle clues that had escaped the notice of others. He inspected the rooms where the deaths had occurred, noting peculiar marks on the walls and the arrangement of furniture. He questioned the servants and relatives, observing their reactions and inconsistencies in their accounts.\n\nAs night fell, a storm gathered outside, casting eerie shadows through the windows of the ancient manor. Holmes gathered us in the drawing-room to share his preliminary findings. He proposed that the deaths were not the result of supernatural forces, as some believed, but rather the work of a calculating individual seeking to conceal a dark secret.\n\nOver the following days, Holmes's relentless pursuit of the truth uncovered a web of deceit, greed, and long-held grudges within the Openshaw family. He identified the murderer through a combination of forensic evidence, psychological insight, and a daring confrontation that brought the culprit to justice.\n\nThe case of the Openshaw family served as a testament to Holmes's unparalleled deductive abilities and his unwavering commitment to uncovering the truth, no matter how deeply it was buried beneath layers of mystery and fear. As we departed Lafter Hall, the sun once again broke through the clouds, illuminating the path ahead and signaling the end of a dark chapter in the family's history."

It was nearly ten o’clock before he entered, looking pale and worn. He walked up to the sideboard, and tearing a piece from the loaf he devoured it voraciously, washing it down with a long draught of water.\n“You are hungry,” I remarked.\n“Starving. It had escaped my memory. I have had nothing since breakfast.”\n“Nothing?”\n“Not a bite. I had no time to think of it.”\n“And how have you succeeded?”\n“Well.”\n“You have a clue?”\n“I have them in the hollow of my hand. Young Openshaw shall not long remain unavenged. Why, Watson, let us put their own devilish trade-mark upon them.

Of these he took five and thrust them into an envelope. On the inside of the flap he wrote “S. H. for J. O.” Then he sealed it and addressed it to “Captain James Calhoun, Barque Lone Star, Savannah, Georgia.”\n“That will await him when he enters port,” said he, chuckling. “It may give him a sleepless night. He will find it as sure a precursor of his fate as Openshaw did before him.”\n“And who is this Captain Calhoun?”\n“The leader of the gang. I shall have the others, but he first.”\n“How did you trace it, then?”\nHe took a large sheet of paper from his pocket, all covered with dates and names.\n“I have spent the whole day,” said he, “over Lloyd’s registers and files of the old papers, following the future career of every vessel which touched at Pondicherry in January and February in ’83. There were thirty-six ships of fair tonnage which were reported there during those months. Of these, one, the Lone Star, instantly attracted my attention, since, although it was reported as having cleared from London, the name is that which is given to one of the states of the Union.”\n“Texas, I think.”\n“I was not and am not sure which; but I knew that the ship must have an American origin.”\n“What then?”\n“I searched the Dundee records, and when I found that the barque Lone Star was there in January, ’85, my suspicion became a certainty. I then inquired as to the vessels which lay at present in the port of London.”\n“Yes?”\n“The Lone Star had arrived here last week. I went down to the Albert Dock and found that she had been taken down the river by the early tide this morning, homeward bound to Savannah. I wired to Gravesend and learned that she had passed some time ago, and as the wind is easterly I have no doubt that she is now past the Goodwins and not very far from the Isle of Wight.”\n“What will you do, then?”\n“Oh, I have my hand upon him. He and the two mates, are as I learn, the only native-born Americans in the ship. The others are Finns and Germans. I know, also, that they were all three away from the ship last night. I had it from the stevedore who has been loading their cargo. By the time that their sailing-ship reaches Savannah the mail-boat will have carried this letter, and the cable will have informed the police of Savannah that these three gentlemen are badly wanted here upon a charge of murder.”",

The fog lay thick upon the city, wrapping the gas lamps in a dim, yellow haze that seemed to swallow the streets whole. As I ascended the stairs to our rooms, I could hear the faint sound of a violin drifting through the door, a sure sign that Holmes was already at his post, immersed in some new problem.\n\nI entered to find him seated in his armchair, the violin resting against his shoulder, his eyes closed in concentration. The room was littered with papers, chemical apparatus, and various oddities collected from his many cases. He opened his eyes as I came in, a faint smile playing upon his lips.\n\n\"Ah, Watson,\" he said, \"just in time. I have been pondering a most curious affair, one that promises to be both challenging and instructive.\"\n\nI settled into my chair, eager to hear the details. Holmes proceeded to outline the case of the 'Speckled Band,' a mysterious and sinister matter involving the sudden death of a young woman named Julia Stoner. Her sister, Helen, had come to Holmes in desperation, fearing for her own life after the strange circumstances surrounding Julia's demise.\n\nHolmes listened intently as I recounted the details Helen had provided: the eerie whistle heard in the dead of night, the locked room with no apparent means of ingress or egress, and the cryptic mention of a 'speckled band' in Julia's last words. The more Holmes considered the facts, the more his keen mind began to unravel the threads of the mystery.\n\n\"Watson,\" he said, \"this case is a perfect example of how appearances can deceive. The locked room, the strange noises, and the sudden death all point to a carefully orchestrated plan. We must visit Stoke Moran, the estate where the sisters reside, and examine the scene ourselves.\"\n\nThe next morning, we set out for the countryside, the journey filled with Holmes's rapid-fire deductions and observations. Upon arrival, we were greeted by Dr. Roylott, the girls' stepfather, a man of imposing stature and a temper as volatile as the storms that often swept the moorlands.\n\nHolmes's scrutiny of the estate revealed several peculiarities: the ventilator connecting the rooms, the bell-pull that did not ring, and the presence of a saucer of milk in the room. Each detail seemed insignificant alone, but together they formed a pattern that Holmes was eager to explore.\n\nThat night, we awaited the hour when the mysterious events were said to occur. Holmes instructed Helen to sleep in her sister's room, while he and I concealed ourselves nearby. As the clock struck two, a low, hissing sound filled the room, followed by a sudden movement near the bed.\n\nHolmes sprang into action, seizing a small, venomous snake—the 'speckled band'—which had been trained to kill by Dr. Roylott. The villain's plan was to eliminate the sisters to secure his inheritance, using the snake as a deadly instrument.\n\nWith the danger averted and the truth revealed, justice was served, and the shadow that had hung over Stoke Moran was lifted. As we returned to London, I reflected on the brilliance of Holmes's methods and the profound impact of his unwavering dedication to uncovering the truth."

          "text_segment": "Isa Whitney, brother of the late Elias Whitney, D.D., Principal of the Theological College of St. George’s, was much addicted to opium. The habit grew upon him, as I understand, from some foolish freak when he was at college; for having read De Quincey’s description of his dreams and sensations, he had drenched his tobacco with laudanum in an attempt to produce the same effects. He found, as so many more have done, that the practice is easier to attain than to get rid of, and for many years he continued to be a slave to the drug, an object of mingled horror and pity to his friends and relatives. I can see him now, with yellow, pasty face, drooping lids, and pin-point pupils, all huddled in a chair, the wreck and ruin of a noble man.\nOne night—it was in June, ’89—there came a ring to my bell, about the hour when a man gives his first yawn and glances at the clock. I sat up in my chair, and my wife laid her needle-work down in her lap and made a little face of disappointment.\n“A patient!” said she. “You’ll have to go out.”\nI groaned, for I was newly come back from a weary day.\nWe heard the door open, a few hurried words, and then quick steps upon the linoleum. Our own door flew open, and a lady, clad in some dark-coloured stuff, with a black veil, entered the room.\n“You will excuse my calling so late,” she began, and then, suddenly losing her self-control, she ran forward, threw her arms about my wife’s neck, and sobbed upon her shoulder. “Oh, I’m in such trouble!” she cried; “I do so want a little help.”\n“Why,” said my wife, pulling up her veil, “it is Kate Whitney. How you startled me, Kate! I had not an idea who you were when you came in.”\n“I didn’t know what to do, so I came straight to you.” That was always the way. Folk who were in grief came to my wife like birds to a lighthouse.\n“It was very sweet of you to come. Now, you must have some wine and water, and sit here comfortably and tell us all about it. Or should you rather that I sent James off to bed?”\n“Oh, no, no! I want the doctor’s advice and help, too. It’s about Isa. He has not been home for two days. I am so frightened about him!”\nIt was not the first time that she had spoken to us of her husband’s trouble, to me as a doctor, to my wife as an old friend and school companion. We soothed and comforted her by such words as we could find. Did she know where her husband was? Was it possible that we could bring him back to her?\nIt seems that it was. She had the surest information that of late he had, when the fit was on him, made use of an opium den in the farthest east of the City. Hitherto his orgies had always been confined to one day, and he had come back, twitching and shattered, in the evening. But now the spell had been upon him eight-and-forty hours, and he lay there, doubtless among the dregs of the docks, breathing in the poison or sleeping off the effects. There he was to be found, she was sure of it, at the Bar of Gold, in Upper Swandam Lane. But what was she to do? How could she, a young and timid woman, make her way into such a place and pluck her husband out from among the ruffians who surrounded him?\nThere was the case, and of course there was but one way out of it. Might I not escort her to this place? And then, as a second thought, why should she come at all? I was Isa Whitney’s medical adviser, and as such I had influence over him. I could manage it better if I were alone. I promised her on my word that I would send him home in a cab within two hours if he were indeed at the address which she had given me. And so in ten minutes I had left my armchair and cheery sitting-room behind me, and was speeding eastward in a hansom on a strange errand, as it seemed to me at the time, though the future only could show how strange it was to be.",

            "prefix-probing": "Isa Whitney, brother of the late Elias Whitney, D.D., Principal of the Theological College of St. George’s, was much addicted to opium. His habit was well known among his acquaintances, and it cast a shadow over his otherwise respectable life. The addiction had begun innocuously enough, as a means to alleviate the chronic pain he suffered from a lingering illness. However, it soon grew into a consuming vice that affected his judgment and behavior.\n\nOne evening, as the fog rolled thick over the streets of London, a peculiar case came to the attention of Sherlock Holmes and Dr. John Watson. A series of mysterious disappearances had been reported in the vicinity of St. George’s College, and the local constabulary was baffled. The missing individuals were all connected to the college in some way, either as students or staff, and their vanishings seemed to coincide with the late hours of the night.\n\nHolmes, ever intrigued by the challenge, agreed to investigate. Upon visiting the college, he was struck by the somber atmosphere that pervaded the institution. The faculty members were tight-lipped, and the students appeared anxious and withdrawn. It was during his inquiries that Holmes learned of Isa Whitney’s opium addiction and the rumors that surrounded him.\n\nDr. Watson, accompanying Holmes, noted the principal’s resemblance to his late brother, Elias Whitney, whose reputation had been impeccable. Isa’s decline was a source of sorrow for many, and some whispered that his addiction had led him down a dark path.\n\nHolmes decided to observe Isa Whitney discreetly. One night, he and Watson followed the principal as he left the college under the cover of darkness. They trailed him through winding alleys until he entered a dilapidated building known to be a haunt for opium smokers. Inside, Holmes noticed a group of shadowy figures engaged in secretive conversation.\n\nAmong them was a man who seemed to be the leader, orchestrating the activities within the den. Holmes deduced that this individual was exploiting Isa Whitney’s addiction for nefarious purposes. The principal, vulnerable and desperate, was being manipulated into facilitating the disappearances.\n\nFurther investigation revealed that the missing persons were being held captive in the building, coerced into participating in illicit schemes orchestrated by the opium den’s leader. Holmes and Watson devised a plan to rescue the captives and bring the criminals to justice.\n\nWith the assistance of the local police, they raided the opium den at dawn. The operation was successful; the missing individuals were freed, and the ringleaders were apprehended. Isa Whitney, though deeply ashamed, was given the opportunity to seek help for his addiction.\n\nThe case highlighted the perils of opium addiction and the vulnerability it created, even among the educated and respected. Holmes reflected on the tragedy of Isa Whitney’s fall from grace and the importance of vigilance in protecting the innocent from such dangers.\n\nIn the aftermath, the college implemented measures to support those struggling with addiction and to prevent similar incidents. The community rallied to restore the institution’s reputation and to honor the memory of Elias Whitney, whose legacy remained untarnished.\n\nThus, through keen observation and unwavering determination, Sherlock Holmes once again brought light to the shadows that lurked within the heart of London, reaffirming his role as the city’s foremost detective."

          "text_segment": "But there was no great difficulty in the first stage of my adventure. Upper Swandam Lane is a vile alley lurking behind the high wharves which line the north side of the river to the east of London Bridge. Between a slop-shop and a gin-shop, approached by a steep flight of steps leading down to a black gap like the mouth of a cave, I found the den of which I was in search. Ordering my cab to wait, I passed down the steps, worn hollow in the centre by the ceaseless tread of drunken feet; and by the light of a flickering oil-lamp above the door I found the latch and made my way into a long, low room, thick and heavy with the brown opium smoke, and terraced with wooden berths, like the forecastle of an emigrant ship.\nThrough the gloom one could dimly catch a glimpse of bodies lying in strange fantastic poses, bowed shoulders, bent knees, heads thrown back, and chins pointing upward, with here and there a dark, lack-lustre eye turned upon the newcomer. Out of the black shadows there glimmered little red circles of light, now bright, now faint, as the burning poison waxed or waned in the bowls of the metal pipes. The most lay silent, but some muttered to themselves, and others talked together in a strange, low, monotonous voice, their conversation coming in gushes, and then suddenly tailing off into silence, each mumbling out his own thoughts and paying little heed to the words of his neighbour. At the farther end was a small brazier of burning charcoal, beside which on a three-legged wooden stool there sat a tall, thin old man, with his jaw resting upon his two fists, and his elbows upon his knees, staring into the fire.\nAs I entered, a sallow Malay attendant had hurried up with a pipe for me and a supply of the drug, beckoning me to an empty berth.\n“Thank you. I have not come to stay,” said I. “There is a friend of mine here, Mr. Isa Whitney, and I wish to speak with him.”\nThere was a movement and an exclamation from my right, and peering through the gloom, I saw Whitney, pale, haggard, and unkempt, staring out at me.\n“My God! It’s Watson,” said he. He was in a pitiable state of reaction, with every nerve in a twitter. “I say, Watson, what o’clock is it?”\n“Nearly eleven.”\n“Of what day?”\n“Of Friday, June 19th.”\n“Good heavens! I thought it was Wednesday. It is Wednesday. What d’you want to frighten a chap for?” He sank his face onto his arms and began to sob in a high treble key.\n“I tell you that it is Friday, man. Your wife has been waiting this two days for you. You should be ashamed of yourself!”\n“So I am. But you’ve got mixed, Watson, for I have only been here a few hours, three pipes, four pipes—I forget how many. But I’ll go home with you. I wouldn’t frighten Kate—poor little Kate. Give me your hand! Have you a cab?”\n“Yes, I have one waiting.”\n“Then I shall go in it. But I must owe something. Find what I owe, Watson. I am all off colour. I can do nothing for myself.”\nI walked down the narrow passage between the double row of sleepers, holding my breath to keep out the vile, stupefying fumes of the drug, and looking about for the manager. As I passed the tall man who sat by the brazier I felt a sudden pluck at my skirt, and a low voice whispered, “Walk past me, and then look back at me.” The words fell quite distinctly upon my ear. I glanced down. They could only have come from the old man at my side, and yet he sat now as absorbed as ever, very thin, very wrinkled, bent with age, an opium pipe dangling down from between his knees, as though it had dropped in sheer lassitude from his fingers. I took two steps forward and looked back. It took all my self-control to prevent me from breaking out into a cry of astonishment. He had turned his back so that none could see him but I. His form had filled out, his wrinkles were gone, the dull eyes had regained their fire, and there, sitting by the fire and grinning at my surprise, was none other than Sherlock Holmes. He made a slight motion to me to approach him, and instantly, as he turned his face half round to the company once more, subsided into a doddering, loose-lipped senility.\n“Holmes!” I whispered, “what on earth are you doing in this den?”\n“As low as you can,” he answered; “I have excellent ears. If you would have the great kindness to get rid of that sottish friend of yours I should be exceedingly glad to have a little talk with you.”\n“I have a cab outside.”\n“Then pray send him home in it. You may safely trust him, for he appears to be too limp to get into any mischief. I should recommend you also to send a note by the cabman to your wife to say that you have thrown in your lot with me. If you will wait outside, I shall be with you in five minutes.”",

As I made my way through the narrow alleys, I could not help but feel a thrill of anticipation, for I was about to embark upon a case that promised to test my wits and courage to their utmost limits.\n\nUpon reaching the lodging house, I was greeted by a surly porter who eyed me with suspicion. I introduced myself as a friend of the tenant, and after a moment's hesitation, he allowed me to ascend the creaking staircase to the third floor. The corridor was dimly lit and reeked of stale tobacco and unwashed bodies. I paused before the door marked with the number seven, and knocked softly.\n\nThe door opened a crack, revealing a pair of keen eyes that studied me intently. \"Who is it?\" a voice demanded.\n\n\"A friend,\" I replied. \"I have urgent news for Mr. James Mortimer.\"\n\nThe door opened wider, and a man of middle age, with a weather-beaten face and a cautious demeanor, stepped out. \"Come in,\" he said, ushering me into a small, sparsely furnished room. \"You have news?\"\n\nI nodded and took a seat. \"Yes, Mr. Mortimer. I have been instructed to inform you that your recent inquiries have attracted the attention of certain unsavory characters. It would be wise to exercise caution.\"\n\nHe frowned, his eyes narrowing. \"I feared as much. The matter I am investigating is of great importance, and I cannot afford to be deterred.\"\n\nI admired his resolve, but I knew the dangers that lurked in the shadows of this city. \"Very well,\" I said. \"Perhaps I can be of assistance.\"\n\nHe looked at me with a mixture of hope and skepticism. \"You would do that?\"\n\n\"Indeed. I have some experience in matters of this sort.\"\n\nThus began our collaboration, and as the day wore on, we exchanged information and formulated a plan to uncover the truth behind the mysterious disappearance that had brought Mr. Mortimer to my door. The clues were scant, but the trail was warm, and I felt the familiar stirrings of excitement that accompany the pursuit of justice.\n\nAs evening fell, I took my leave, promising to return with news. The streets were now cloaked in darkness, and the gas lamps cast flickering shadows upon the pavement. I could not shake the feeling that unseen eyes were watching my every move, and I quickened my pace, eager to reach the safety of my lodgings.\n\nThat night, as I sat by the fire, I reviewed the facts of the case and pondered the next steps. The game was afoot, and I was determined to see it through to its conclusion, no matter the cost."

          "text_segment": "It was difficult to refuse any of Sherlock Holmes’ requests, for they were always so exceedingly definite, and put forward with such a quiet air of mastery. I felt, however, that when Whitney was once confined in the cab my mission was practically accomplished; and for the rest, I could not wish anything better than to be associated with my friend in one of those singular adventures which were the normal condition of his existence. In a few minutes I had written my note, paid Whitney’s bill, led him out to the cab, and seen him driven through the darkness. In a very short time a decrepit figure had emerged from the opium den, and I was walking down the street with Sherlock Holmes. For two streets he shuffled along with a bent back and an uncertain foot. Then, glancing quickly round, he straightened himself out and burst into a hearty fit of laughter.\n“I suppose, Watson,” said he, “that you imagine that I have added opium-smoking to cocaine injections, and all the other little weaknesses on which you have favoured me with your medical views.”\n“I was certainly surprised to find you there.”\n“But not more so than I to find you.”\n“I came to find a friend.”\n“And I to find an enemy.”\n“An enemy?”\n“Yes; one of my natural enemies, or, shall I say, my natural prey. Briefly, Watson, I am in the midst of a very remarkable inquiry, and I have hoped to find a clue in the incoherent ramblings of these sots, as I have done before now. Had I been recognised in that den my life would not have been worth an hour’s purchase; for I have used it before now for my own purposes, and the rascally Lascar who runs it has sworn to have vengeance upon me. There is a trap-door at the back of that building, near the corner of Paul’s Wharf, which could tell some strange tales of what has passed through it upon the moonless nights.”\n“What! You do not mean bodies?”\n“Ay, bodies, Watson. We should be rich men if we had £ 1000 for every poor devil who has been done to death in that den. It is the vilest murder-trap on the whole riverside, and I fear that Neville St. Clair has entered it never to leave it more. But our trap should be here.” He put his two forefingers between his teeth and whistled shrilly—a signal which was answered by a similar whistle from the distance, followed shortly by the rattle of wheels and the clink of horses’ hoofs.\n“Now, Watson,” said Holmes, as a tall dog-cart dashed up through the gloom, throwing out two golden tunnels of yellow light from its side lanterns. “You’ll come with me, won’t you?”\n“If I can be of use.”\n“Oh, a trusty comrade is always of use; and a chronicler still more so. My room at The Cedars is a double-bedded one.”\n“The Cedars?”\n“Yes; that is Mr. St. Clair’s house. I am staying there while I conduct the inquiry.”\n“Where is it, then?”\n“Near Lee, in Kent. We have a seven-mile drive before us.”\n“But I am all in the dark.”\n“Of course you are. You’ll know all about it presently. Jump up here. All right, John; we shall not need you. Here’s half a crown. Look out for me to-morrow, about eleven. Give her her head. So long, then!”\nHe flicked the horse with his whip, and we dashed away through the endless succession of sombre and deserted streets, which widened gradually, until we were flying across a broad balustraded bridge, with the murky river flowing sluggishly beneath us. Beyond lay another dull wilderness of bricks and mortar, its silence broken only by the heavy, regular footfall of the policeman, or the songs and shouts of some belated party of revellers. A dull wrack was drifting slowly across the sky, and a star or two twinkled dimly here and there through the rifts of the clouds. Holmes drove in silence, with his head sunk upon his breast, and the air of a man who is lost in thought, while I sat beside him, curious to learn what this new quest might be which seemed to tax his powers so sorely, and yet afraid to break in upon the current of his thoughts. We had driven several miles, and were beginning to get to the fringe of the belt of suburban villas, when he shook himself, shrugged his shoulders, and lit up his pipe with the air of a man who has satisfied himself that he is acting for the best.\n“You have a grand gift of silence, Watson,” said he. “It makes you quite invaluable as a companion. ’Pon my word, it is a great thing for me to have someone to talk to, for my own thoughts are not over-pleasant. I was wondering what I should say to this dear little woman to-night when she meets me at the door.”\n“You forget that I know nothing about it.”\n“I shall just have time to tell you the facts of the case before we get to Lee. It seems absurdly simple, and yet, somehow I can get nothing to go upon. There’s plenty of thread, no doubt, but I can’t get the end of it into my hand. Now, I’ll state the case clearly and concisely to you, Watson, and maybe you can see a spark where all is dark to me.”\n“Proceed, then.”\n“Some years ago—to be definite, in May, 1884—there came to Lee a gentleman, Neville St. Clair by name, who appeared to have plenty of money. He took a large villa, laid out the grounds very nicely, and lived generally in good style. By degrees he made friends in the neighbourhood, and in 1887 he married the daughter of a local brewer, by whom he now has two children. He had no occupation, but was interested in several companies and went into town as a rule in the morning, returning by the 5:14 from Cannon Street every night. Mr. St. Clair is now thirty-seven years of age, is a man of temperate habits, a good husband, a very affectionate father, and a man who is popular with all who know him. I may add that his whole debts at the present moment, as far as we have been able to ascertain, amount to £ 88 10s., while he has £ 220 standing to his credit in the Capital and Counties Bank. There is no reason, therefore, to think that money troubles have been weighing upon his mind.\n“Last Monday Mr. Neville St. Clair went into town rather earlier than usual, remarking before he started that he had two important commissions to perform, and that he would bring his little boy home a box of bricks. Now, by the merest chance, his wife received a telegram upon this same Monday, very shortly after his departure, to the effect that a small parcel of considerable value which she had been expecting was waiting for her at the offices of the Aberdeen Shipping Company. Now, if you are well up in your London, you will know that the office of the company is in Fresno Street, which branches out of Upper Swandam Lane, where you found me to-night. Mrs. St. Clair had her lunch, started for the City, did some shopping, proceeded to the company’s office, got her packet, and found herself at exactly 4:35 walking through Swandam Lane on her way back to the station. Have you followed me so far?”\n“It is very clear.”\n“If you remember, Monday was an exceedingly hot day, and Mrs. St. Clair walked slowly, glancing about in the hope of seeing a cab, as she did not like the neighbourhood in which she found herself. While she was walking in this way down Swandam Lane, she suddenly heard an ejaculation or cry, and was struck cold to see her husband looking down at her and, as it seemed to her, beckoning to her from a second-floor window. The window was open, and she distinctly saw his face, which she describes as being terribly agitated. He waved his hands frantically to her, and then vanished from the window so suddenly that it seemed to her that he had been plucked back by some irresistible force from behind. One singular point which struck her quick feminine eye was that although he wore some dark coat, such as he had started to town in, he had on neither collar nor necktie.\n“Convinced that something was amiss with him, she rushed down the steps—for the house was none other than the opium den in which you found me to-night—and running through the front room she attempted to ascend the stairs which led to the first floor. At the foot of the stairs, however, she met this Lascar scoundrel of whom I have spoken, who thrust her back and, aided by a Dane, who acts as assistant there, pushed her out into the street. Filled with the most maddening doubts and fears, she rushed down the lane and, by rare good-fortune, met in Fresno Street a number of constables with an inspector, all on their way to their beat. The inspector and two men accompanied her back, and in spite of the continued resistance of the proprietor, they made their way to the room in which Mr. St. Clair had last been seen. There was no sign of him there. In fact, in the whole of that floor there was no one to be found save a crippled wretch of hideous aspect, who, it seems, made his home there. Both he and the Lascar stoutly swore that no one else had been in the front room during the afternoon. So determined was their denial that the inspector was staggered, and had almost come to believe that Mrs. St. Clair had been deluded when, with a cry, she sprang at a small deal box which lay upon the table and tore the lid from it. Out there fell a cascade of children’s bricks. It was the toy which he had promised to bring home.\n“This discovery, and the evident confusion which the cripple showed, made the inspector realise that the matter was serious. The rooms were carefully examined, and results all pointed to an abominable crime. The front room was plainly furnished as a sitting-room and led into a small bedroom, which looked out upon the back of one of the wharves. Between the wharf and the bedroom window is a narrow strip, which is dry at low tide but is covered at high tide with at least four and a half feet of water. The bedroom window was a broad one and opened from below. On examination traces of blood were to be seen upon the windowsill, and several scattered drops were visible upon the wooden floor of the bedroom. Thrust away behind a curtain in the front room were all the clothes of Mr. Neville St. Clair, with the exception of his coat. His boots, his socks, his hat, and his watch—all were there. There were no signs of violence upon any of these garments, and there were no other traces of Mr. Neville St. Clair. Out of the window he must apparently have gone for no other exit could be discovered, and the ominous bloodstains upon the sill gave little promise that he could save himself by swimming, for the tide was at its very highest at the moment of the tragedy.\n“And now as to the villains who seemed to be immediately implicated in the matter. The Lascar was known to be a man of the vilest antecedents, but as, by Mrs. St. Clair’s story, he was known to have been at the foot of the stair within a very few seconds of her husband’s appearance at the window, he could hardly have been more than an accessory to the crime. His defence was one of absolute ignorance, and he protested that he had no knowledge as to the doings of Hugh Boone, his lodger, and that he could not account in any way for the presence of the missing gentleman’s clothes.\n“So much for the Lascar manager. Now for the sinister cripple who lives upon the second floor of the opium den, and who was certainly the last human being whose eyes rested upon Neville St. Clair. His name is Hugh Boone, and his hideous face is one which is familiar to every man who goes much to the City. He is a professional beggar, though in order to avoid the police regulations he pretends to a small trade in wax vestas. Some little distance down Threadneedle Street, upon the left-hand side, there is, as you may have remarked, a small angle in the wall. Here it is that this creature takes his daily seat, cross-legged with his tiny stock of matches on his lap, and as he is a piteous spectacle a small rain of charity descends into the greasy leather cap which lies upon the pavement beside him. I have watched the fellow more than once before ever I thought of making his professional acquaintance, and I have been surprised at the harvest which he has reaped in a short time. His appearance, you see, is so remarkable that no one can pass him without observing him. A shock of orange hair, a pale face disfigured by a horrible scar, which, by its contraction, has turned up the outer edge of his upper lip, a bulldog chin, and a pair of very penetrating dark eyes, which present a singular contrast to the colour of his hair, all mark him out from amid the common crowd of mendicants and so, too, does his wit, for he is ever ready with a reply to any piece of chaff which may be thrown at him by the passers-by. This is the man whom we now learn to have been the lodger at the opium den, and to have been the last man to see the gentleman of whom we are in quest.”\n“But a cripple!” said I. “What could he have done single-handed against a man in the prime of life?”\n“He is a cripple in the sense that he walks with a limp; but in other respects he appears to be a powerful and well-nurtured man. Surely your medical experience would tell you, Watson, that weakness in one limb is often compensated for by exceptional strength in the others.”\n“Pray continue your narrative.”\n“Mrs. St. Clair had fainted at the sight of the blood upon the window, and she was escorted home in a cab by the police, as her presence could be of no help to them in their investigations. Inspector Barton, who had charge of the case, made a very careful examination of the premises, but without finding anything which threw any light upon the matter. One mistake had been made in not arresting Boone instantly, as he was allowed some few minutes during which he might have communicated with his friend the Lascar, but this fault was soon remedied, and he was seized and searched, without anything being found which could incriminate him. There were, it is true, some blood-stains upon his right shirt-sleeve, but he pointed to his ring-finger, which had been cut near the nail, and explained that the bleeding came from there, adding that he had been to the window not long before, and that the stains which had been observed there came doubtless from the same source. He denied strenuously having ever seen Mr. Neville St. Clair and swore that the presence of the clothes in his room was as much a mystery to him as to the police. As to Mrs. St. Clair’s assertion that she had actually seen her husband at the window, he declared that she must have been either mad or dreaming. He was removed, loudly protesting, to the police-station, while the inspector remained upon the premises in the hope that the ebbing tide might afford some fresh clue.\n“And it did, though they hardly found upon the mud-bank what they had feared to find. It was Neville St. Clair’s coat, and not Neville St. Clair, which lay uncovered as the tide receded. And what do you think they found in the pockets?”\n“I cannot imagine.”\n“No, I don’t think you would guess. Every pocket stuffed with pennies and half-pennies—421 pennies and 270 half-pennies. It was no wonder that it had not been swept away by the tide. But a human body is a different matter. There is a fierce eddy between the wharf and the house. It seemed likely enough that the weighted coat had remained when the stripped body had been sucked away into the river.”\n“But I understand that all the other clothes were found in the room. Would the body be dressed in a coat alone?”\n“No, sir, but the facts might be met speciously enough. Suppose that this man Boone had thrust Neville St. Clair through the window, there is no human eye which could have seen the deed. What would he do then? It would of course instantly strike him that he must get rid of the tell-tale garments. He would seize the coat, then, and be in the act of throwing it out, when it would occur to him that it would swim and not sink. He has little time, for he has heard the scuffle downstairs when the wife tried to force her way up, and perhaps he has already heard from his Lascar confederate that the police are hurrying up the street. There is not an instant to be lost. He rushes to some secret hoard, where he has accumulated the fruits of his beggary, and he stuffs all the coins upon which he can lay his hands into the pockets to make sure of the coat’s sinking. He throws it out, and would have done the same with the other garments had not he heard the rush of steps below, and only just had time to close the window when the police appeared.”\n“It certainly sounds feasible.”\n“Well, we will take it as a working hypothesis for want of a better. Boone, as I have told you, was arrested and taken to the station, but it could not be shown that there had ever before been anything against him. He had for years been known as a professional beggar, but his life appeared to have been a very quiet and innocent one. There the matter stands at present, and the questions which have to be solved—what Neville St. Clair was doing in the opium den, what happened to him when there, where is he now, and what Hugh Boone had to do with his disappearance—are all as far from a solution as ever. I confess that I cannot recall any case within my experience which looked at the first glance so simple and yet which presented such difficulties.”",

After a few minutes he straightened himself up, threw off his shuffling gait, and laughed heartily.\n\n\"Well, Watson,\" he said, \"do you suspect me of having added opium smoking to my other vices?\"\n\n\"I confess I did.\"\n\n\"And I thought you were the last man in London to be found in such a place.\"\n\n\"I was looking for an enemy, or, as I call it, a natural prey.\"\n\n\"A remarkable inquiry.\"\n\n\"Yes, and I hoped to find some clue in the ramblings of the addicts.\"\n\n\"It was a dangerous experiment.\"\n\n\"Yes, the proprietor of the den, a Lascar, would have recognized me, and would have been only too glad to have me killed.\"\n\n\"What is the secret of the place?\"\n\n\"There is a trap-door in the floor, which is used for disposing of bodies.\"\n\n\"Good heavens!\"\n\n\"I fear that a man named Neville St. Clair entered the den and never left.\"\n\nHolmes whistled sharply, and a dog-cart came round the corner.\n\n\"Come along, Watson,\" he said. \"I want you with me. A comrade and a chronicler are always valuable.\"\n\nHe jumped into the dog-cart, and I followed. \"Where are we going?\"\n\n\"To The Cedars, Mr. St. Clair's house near Lee, in Kent. I am staying there, and have a double-bedded room.\"\n\nI was quite in the dark as to the nature of the case, but I was glad to be of service.\n\nThe seven miles passed quickly, and Holmes began to explain as we drove.\n\n\"I want your fresh eyes and your common sense, Watson. Neville St. Clair is a well-to-do man, a respectable family man, living at Lee. He disappeared last Monday after going to London. His wife, by chance, was in Upper Swandam Lane that afternoon, and saw him looking agitated at a second-floor window of the opium den. He seemed to beckon her frantically before vanishing as if pulled back. She noted he wore no collar or tie.\"\n\n\"She tried to enter but was stopped by the Lascar proprietor.\"\n\n\"Yes, and she fetched the police, who investigated the room. There was no sign of St. Clair, only a hideous crippled beggar named Hugh Boone, who lived there. Both Boone and the Lascar denied St. Clair had been there.\"\n\n\"Mrs. St. Clair found a box of toy bricks St. Clair had promised their child.\"\n\n\"The police found bloodstains on the windowsill and floor of the back bedroom, which overlooked the Thames, though the high tide covered the bank.\"\n\n\"All of St. Clair's clothes, except his coat, were found hidden in the front room.\"\n\n\"The assumption was that St. Clair went out the window, with little chance of survival due to the high tide.\"\n\n\"The Lascar, though villainous, was downstairs and likely only an accessory.\"\n\n\"Hugh Boone, the cripple, was the last person known to be in the room.\"\n\n\"Boone is a well-known professional beggar, often seen in the City, recognizable by his scarred face and orange hair.\"\n\n\"Though limping, he appears physically powerful.\"\n\n\"Boone was arrested after some delay; bloodstains on his sleeve were explained by a cut finger.\"\n\n\"He denied everything, calling Mrs. St. Clair's sighting a delusion.\"\n\n\"Later, the ebbing tide revealed St. Clair's coat on the mud bank, heavily weighted with hundreds of pennies and halfpennies.\"\n\n\"I have a theory: Boone pushed St. Clair out the window, weighted the coat to sink it, but was interrupted by the police arriving before he could dispose of the other clothes.\"\n\n\"Boone has no prior criminal record beyond begging.\"\n\n\"The questions of St. Clair's presence in the den, his fate, his current location, and Boone's involvement remain unsolved, presenting unexpected difficulties.\"\n\n\"Now, Watson, what do you make of it?\"",

On this particular morning, as the fog lay thick over the streets of London, I found myself once again drawn into the vortex of his latest investigation. Holmes had been pacing the room with his usual restless energy, his keen eyes gleaming with anticipation.\n\n\"Watson,\" he said abruptly, \"I have just received a most intriguing letter. It concerns a case that promises to be both challenging and unusual.\"\n\nI settled into my chair, eager to hear the details. Holmes unfolded the letter and began to read aloud:\n\n\"Dear Mr. Holmes,\n\nI am in desperate need of your assistance. My name is Miss Violet Hunter, and I am a governess employed at a remote estate in the countryside. Strange occurrences have been taking place, and I fear for my safety. I implore you to come at once.\n\nYours sincerely,\nViolet Hunter\"\n\nHolmes looked up, his expression serious. \"This, Watson, is a matter that requires our immediate attention. The safety of an innocent young woman is at stake. We must depart at once.\"\n\nWithout hesitation, we gathered our belongings and set out for the estate. The journey was long and arduous, but Holmes remained undeterred. Upon arrival, we were greeted by Miss Hunter, a composed and intelligent young woman who recounted the unsettling events that had led her to seek our help.\n\nShe spoke of mysterious noises in the night, unexplained shadows, and a pervasive sense of dread that had settled over the household. Holmes listened intently, his mind already piecing together the fragments of the puzzle.\n\nOver the following days, we conducted a thorough investigation, examining every corner of the estate and interviewing its inhabitants. Holmes' keen observation and deductive reasoning soon uncovered a web of deceit and hidden motives.\n\nIn the end, justice was served, and Miss Hunter's safety was assured. As we departed, Holmes remarked, \"Once again, Watson, we have seen how the truth, though often concealed beneath layers of mystery, can be revealed through careful scrutiny and unwavering determination.\"\n\nI could not help but admire his brilliance and dedication, qualities that made him not only a remarkable detective but also a steadfast friend."

Just as he finished, however, we drove through two scattered villages, where a few lights still glimmered in the windows.\n“We are on the outskirts of Lee,” said my companion. “We have touched on three English counties in our short drive, starting in Middlesex, passing over an angle of Surrey, and ending in Kent. See that light among the trees? That is The Cedars, and beside that lamp sits a woman whose anxious ears have already, I have little doubt, caught the clink of our horse’s feet.”\n“But why are you not conducting the case from Baker Street?” I asked.\n“Because there are many inquiries which must be made out here. Mrs. St. Clair has most kindly put two rooms at my disposal, and you may rest assured that she will have nothing but a welcome for my friend and colleague. I hate to meet her, Watson, when I have no news of her husband. Here we are. Whoa, there, whoa!”\nWe had pulled up in front of a large villa which stood within its own grounds. A stable-boy had run out to the horse’s head, and springing down, I followed Holmes up the small, winding gravel-drive which led to the house. As we approached, the door flew open, and a little blonde woman stood in the opening, clad in some sort of light mousseline de soie, with a touch of fluffy pink chiffon at her neck and wrists. She stood with her figure outlined against the flood of light, one hand upon the door, one half-raised in her eagerness, her body slightly bent, her head and face protruded, with eager eyes and parted lips, a standing question.\n“Well?” she cried, “well?” And then, seeing that there were two of us, she gave a cry of hope which sank into a groan as she saw that my companion shook his head and shrugged his shoulders.\n“No good news?”\n“None.”\n“No bad?”\n“No.”\n“Thank God for that. But come in. You must be weary, for you have had a long day.”\n“This is my friend, Dr. Watson. He has been of most vital use to me in several of my cases, and a lucky chance has made it possible for me to bring him out and associate him with this investigation.”\n“I am delighted to see you,” said she, pressing my hand warmly. “You will, I am sure, forgive anything that may be wanting in our arrangements, when you consider the blow which has come so suddenly upon us.”\n“My dear madam,” said I, “I am an old campaigner, and if I were not I can very well see that no apology is needed. If I can be of any assistance, either to you or to my friend here, I shall be indeed happy.”\n“Now, Mr. Sherlock Holmes,” said the lady as we entered a well-lit dining-room, upon the table of which a cold supper had been laid out, “I should very much like to ask you one or two plain questions, to which I beg that you will give a plain answer.”\n“Certainly, madam.”\n“Do not trouble about my feelings. I am not hysterical, nor given to fainting. I simply wish to hear your real, real opinion.”\n“Upon what point?”\n“In your heart of hearts, do you think that Neville is alive?”\nSherlock Holmes seemed to be embarrassed by the question. “Frankly, now!” she repeated, standing upon the rug and looking keenly down at him as he leaned back in a basket-chair.\n“Frankly, then, madam, I do not.”\n“You think that he is dead?”\n“I do.”\n“Murdered?”\n“I don’t say that. Perhaps.”\n“And on what day did he meet his death?”\n“On Monday.”\n“Then perhaps, Mr. Holmes, you will be good enough to explain how it is that I have received a letter from him to-day.”",

            "prefix-probing": "The night was dark and the road was rough, but Holmes's keen eyes missed nothing. He was in his element, his mind racing ahead to the solution of the mystery that had brought us out into the countryside at such an hour. The case was one of those which, from the first moment, had gripped his attention with a peculiar fascination.\n\n\"You see, Watson,\" he began, \"the peculiar circumstances of the disappearance of the young lady from her own home are not as simple as they appear. There is a subtlety here which the ordinary mind would overlook.\"\n\nI listened intently as Holmes outlined the facts: a young woman, Miss Violet Hunter, had vanished from her father's estate without a trace. No ransom note, no sign of struggle, and no apparent motive. The local constabulary were baffled, and the family was in despair.\n\n\"The key to the mystery,\" Holmes continued, \"lies in the behavior of the household staff and the peculiar habits of the missing lady.\"\n\nAs we drove deeper into the countryside, the moon broke through the clouds, casting a silvery light upon the fields and hedgerows. The stillness of the night was broken only by the rhythmic clatter of the carriage wheels and the occasional hoot of an owl.\n\n\"Holmes,\" I ventured, \"do you truly believe that Miss Hunter's disappearance is the result of foul play?\"\n\nHe nodded gravely. \"I do, Watson. There are too many inconsistencies in the official account. The absence of any forced entry, the lack of footprints around the garden, and the strange behavior of the gardener all point to a carefully orchestrated plan.\"\n\nOur destination was a small village on the edge of the moor, where Holmes intended to make inquiries. Upon arrival, we found the local inn, a modest establishment with a few patrons gathered around the hearth. Holmes's reputation preceded him, and the landlord was eager to assist.\n\n\"Have you heard anything unusual in the past few days?\" Holmes inquired.\n\nThe landlord shook his head. \"Nothing out of the ordinary, sir. Just the usual gossip and the occasional traveler passing through.\"\n\nHolmes was not convinced. He requested to see the gardener, a man named James McCarthy, who was known to be somewhat reclusive. When McCarthy arrived, Holmes observed him closely, noting the nervous twitch of his fingers and the evasive glances.\n\n\"Mr. McCarthy,\" Holmes began, \"I understand you were on duty the night Miss Hunter disappeared. Can you tell me what you saw?\"\n\nThe gardener hesitated before replying, \"I didn't see much, sir. I was in the greenhouse tending to the plants.\"\n\nHolmes's eyes narrowed. \"And did you hear anything unusual? Voices, footsteps, or the sound of a carriage?\"\n\nMcCarthy shook his head. \"No, sir. It was a quiet night.\"\n\nHolmes exchanged a glance with me. \"I believe, Mr. McCarthy, that you are not telling the whole truth.\"\n\nThe gardener's composure faltered. \"I... I didn't want to get involved, sir. But I did see a man lurking near the east gate around midnight. He was wearing a dark cloak and had a peculiar limp.\"\n\nThis revelation was crucial. Holmes immediately set about piecing together the clues. The man with the limp was a known criminal in the area, and his presence near the estate at such a time was highly suspicious.\n\nWe spent the next few days investigating, following leads that took us through the winding lanes and desolate moorlands. Holmes's deductive powers were in full force, and I marveled at his ability to connect disparate facts into a coherent narrative.\n\nFinally, our efforts bore fruit. We discovered a hidden cellar beneath an abandoned farmhouse, where Miss Hunter was being held captive. The kidnapper, the man with the limp, was apprehended and brought to justice.\n\nAs we returned to London, Holmes reflected on the case. \"It is a reminder, Watson, that appearances can be deceiving, and that the truth often lies hidden beneath layers of deception.\"\n\nI could not help but agree. The adventure had been a testament to Holmes's unparalleled skill and unwavering dedication to justice."

It is, of course, a trifle, but there is nothing so important as trifles. Let us now see the letter. Ha! there has been an enclosure here!”\n“Yes, there was a ring. His signet-ring.”\n“And you are sure that this is your husband’s hand?”\n“One of his hands.”\n“One?”\n“His hand when he wrote hurriedly. It is very unlike his usual writing, and yet I know it well.”\n“‘Dearest do not be frightened. All will come well. There is a huge error which it may take some little time to rectify. Wait in patience.—NEVILLE.’ Written in pencil upon the fly-leaf of a book, octavo size, no water-mark. Hum! Posted to-day in Gravesend by a man with a dirty thumb. Ha! And the flap has been gummed, if I am not very much in error, by a person who had been chewing tobacco. And you have no doubt that it is your husband’s hand, madam?”\n“None. Neville wrote those words.”\n“And they were posted to-day at Gravesend. Well, Mrs. St. Clair, the clouds lighten, though I should not venture to say that the danger is over.”\n“But he must be alive, Mr. Holmes.”\n“Unless this is a clever forgery to put us on the wrong scent. The ring, after all, proves nothing. It may have been taken from him.”\n“No, no; it is, it is his very own writing!”\n“Very well. It may, however, have been written on Monday and only posted to-day.”\n“That is possible.”\n“If so, much may have happened between.”\n“Oh, you must not discourage me, Mr. Holmes. I know that all is well with him. There is so keen a sympathy between us that I should know if evil came upon him. On the very day that I saw him last he cut himself in the bedroom, and yet I in the dining-room rushed upstairs instantly with the utmost certainty that something had happened. Do you think that I would respond to such a trifle and yet be ignorant of his death?”\n“I have seen too much not to know that the impression of a woman may be more valuable than the conclusion of an analytical reasoner. And in this letter you certainly have a very strong piece of evidence to corroborate your view. But if your husband is alive and able to write letters, why should he remain away from you?”\n“I cannot imagine. It is unthinkable.”\n“And on Monday he made no remarks before leaving you?”\n“No.”\n“And you were surprised to see him in Swandam Lane?”\n“Very much so.”\n“Was the window open?”\n“Yes.”\n“Then he might have called to you?”\n“He might.”\n“He only, as I understand, gave an inarticulate cry?”\n“Yes.”\n“A call for help, you thought?”\n“Yes. He waved his hands.”\n“But it might have been a cry of surprise. Astonishment at the unexpected sight of you might cause him to throw up his hands?”\n“It is possible.”\n“And you thought he was pulled back?”\n“He disappeared so suddenly.”\n“He might have leaped back. You did not see anyone else in the room?”\n“No, but this horrible man confessed to having been there, and the Lascar was at the foot of the stairs.”\n“Quite so. Your husband, as far as you could see, had his ordinary clothes on?”\n“But without his collar or tie. I distinctly saw his bare throat.”\n“Had he ever spoken of Swandam Lane?”\n“Never.”\n“Had he ever showed any signs of having taken opium?”\n“Never.”\n“Thank you, Mrs. St. Clair. Those are the principal points about which I wished to be absolutely clear. We shall now have a little supper and then retire, for we may have a very busy day to-morrow.”\nA large and comfortable double-bedded room had been placed at our disposal, and I was quickly between the sheets, for I was weary after my night of adventure. Sherlock Holmes was a man, however, who, when he had an unsolved problem upon his mind, would go for days, and even for a week, without rest, turning it over, rearranging his facts, looking at it from every point of view until he had either fathomed it or convinced himself that his data were insufficient. It was soon evident to me that he was now preparing for an all-night sitting. He took off his coat and waistcoat, put on a large blue dressing-gown, and then wandered about the room collecting pillows from his bed and cushions from the sofa and armchairs. With these he constructed a sort of Eastern divan, upon which he perched himself cross-legged, with an ounce of shag tobacco and a box of matches laid out in front of him. In the dim light of the lamp I saw him sitting there, an old briar pipe between his lips, his eyes fixed vacantly upon the corner of the ceiling, the blue smoke curling up from him, silent, motionless, with the light shining upon his strong-set aquiline features. So he sat as I dropped off to sleep, and so he sat when a sudden ejaculation caused me to wake up, and I found the summer sun shining into the apartment.",

He probed whether Neville might have leaped back rather than being pulled, and confirmed she saw no one else, though Boone and the Lascar were present.

We must set out at once if we are to prevent a tragedy.\"\n\nI looked up from the letter I was reading, startled by his sudden energy. \"What has happened, Holmes?\"\n\nHe paced the room, his keen eyes alight with excitement. \"A telegram has just arrived from a client in distress. It concerns the disappearance of a young woman, Miss Violet Hunter, who has vanished under mysterious circumstances.\"\n\nI rose and gathered my coat. \"Then we must not delay. Lead the way, Holmes.\"\n\nWithin the hour, we were aboard the train bound for the small town where Miss Hunter had last been seen. Holmes was silent during the journey, his mind evidently racing through the possibilities. I, too, was deep in thought, pondering the nature of the case.\n\nUpon our arrival, we were met by a local constable who escorted us to the Hunter residence. The house was modest but well-kept, and the family appeared deeply troubled.\n\nMiss Hunter's mother greeted us with tear-streaked cheeks. \"Thank you for coming, Mr. Holmes. Violet has been missing for three days, and we fear the worst.\"\n\nHolmes nodded gravely. \"Tell me everything you know, Mrs. Hunter.\"\n\nShe recounted how Violet had been employed as a governess for a wealthy family in the neighboring village. She had left home with high hopes, but recently, her letters had become infrequent and filled with vague references to a mysterious presence watching her.\n\nHolmes listened intently, then turned to the constable. \"Have you conducted a thorough search of the area?\"\n\nThe constable nodded. \"Yes, sir, but there have been no signs of Miss Hunter.\"\n\nHolmes's eyes narrowed. \"We must visit the household where she was employed. There may be clues there.\"\n\nThe journey to the estate was brief, and we were soon standing before a grand manor. The butler ushered us inside, and we were introduced to Mr. and Mrs. Rucastle, Violet's employers.\n\nMr. Rucastle was a stern man, his gaze cold and unyielding. Mrs. Rucastle, by contrast, was nervous and evasive.\n\nHolmes began his inquiries, asking about Violet's duties and her interactions with the family. Mr. Rucastle was curt, offering little information, while Mrs. Rucastle seemed reluctant to speak.\n\nHolmes's keen observation soon revealed inconsistencies in their accounts. He noticed a faint scent of tobacco in the drawing-room, unusual for a household that forbade smoking. He also observed a hidden compartment in the study, cleverly concealed behind a bookshelf.\n\n\"May I examine this, Mr. Rucastle?\" Holmes inquired.\n\nThe man hesitated but nodded.\n\nHolmes pressed a hidden latch, and the bookshelf swung open to reveal a small safe. Inside, we found letters and documents that hinted at a secret past and possible motives for silencing Violet.\n\nAs we delved deeper, it became clear that Violet had uncovered something dangerous, something that threatened the Rucastles' reputation and fortune.\n\nHolmes's deductions led us to a nearby abandoned cottage, where we discovered Violet, unharmed but frightened. She had been held captive to prevent her from revealing the truth.\n\nWith the mystery solved and Violet safe, we returned to London, the case a testament to Holmes's unparalleled skill and unwavering dedication to justice."

No one is stirring yet, but I know where the stable-boy sleeps, and we shall soon have the trap out.” He chuckled to himself as he spoke, his eyes twinkled, and he seemed a different man to the sombre thinker of the previous night.\nAs I dressed I glanced at my watch. It was no wonder that no one was stirring. It was twenty-five minutes past four. I had hardly finished when Holmes returned with the news that the boy was putting in the horse.\n“I want to test a little theory of mine,” said he, pulling on his boots. “I think, Watson, that you are now standing in the presence of one of the most absolute fools in Europe. I deserve to be kicked from here to Charing Cross. But I think I have the key of the affair now.”\n“And where is it?” I asked, smiling.\n“In the bathroom,” he answered. “Oh, yes, I am not joking,” he continued, seeing my look of incredulity. “I have just been there, and I have taken it out, and I have got it in this Gladstone bag. Come on, my boy, and we shall see whether it will not fit the lock.”\nWe made our way downstairs as quietly as possible, and out into the bright morning sunshine. In the road stood our horse and trap, with the half-clad stable-boy waiting at the head. We both sprang in, and away we dashed down the London Road. A few country carts were stirring, bearing in vegetables to the metropolis, but the lines of villas on either side were as silent and lifeless as some city in a dream.\n“It has been in some points a singular case,” said Holmes, flicking the horse on into a gallop. “I confess that I have been as blind as a mole, but it is better to learn wisdom late than never to learn it at all.”\nIn town the earliest risers were just beginning to look sleepily from their windows as we drove through the streets of the Surrey side. Passing down the Waterloo Bridge Road we crossed over the river, and dashing up Wellington Street wheeled sharply to the right and found ourselves in Bow Street. Sherlock Holmes was well known to the force, and the two constables at the door saluted him. One of them held the horse’s head while the other led us in.\n“Who is on duty?” asked Holmes.\n“Inspector Bradstreet, sir.”\n“Ah, Bradstreet, how are you?” A tall, stout official had come down the stone-flagged passage, in a peaked cap and frogged jacket. “I wish to have a quiet word with you, Bradstreet.”\n“Certainly, Mr. Holmes. Step into my room here.”\nIt was a small, office-like room, with a huge ledger upon the table, and a telephone projecting from the wall. The inspector sat down at his desk.\n“What can I do for you, Mr. Holmes?”\n“I called about that beggarman, Boone—the one who was charged with being concerned in the disappearance of Mr. Neville St. Clair, of Lee.”\n“Yes. He was brought up and remanded for further inquiries.”\n“So I heard. You have him here?”\n“In the cells.”\n“Is he quiet?”\n“Oh, he gives no trouble. But he is a dirty scoundrel.”\n“Dirty?”\n“Yes, it is all we can do to make him wash his hands, and his face is as black as a tinker’s. Well, when once his case has been settled, he will have a regular prison bath; and I think, if you saw him, you would agree with me that he needed it.”\n“I should like to see him very much.”\n“Would you? That is easily done. Come this way. You can leave your bag.”\n“No, I think that I’ll take it.”\n“Very good. Come this way, if you please.” He led us down a passage, opened a barred door, passed down a winding stair, and brought us to a whitewashed corridor with a line of doors on each side.\n“The third on the right is his,” said the inspector. “Here it is!” He quietly shot back a panel in the upper part of the door and glanced through.\n“He is asleep,” said he. “You can see him very well.”\nWe both put our eyes to the grating. The prisoner lay with his face towards us, in a very deep sleep, breathing slowly and heavily. He was a middle-sized man, coarsely clad as became his calling, with a coloured shirt protruding through the rent in his tattered coat. He was, as the inspector had said, extremely dirty, but the grime which covered his face could not conceal its repulsive ugliness. A broad wheal from an old scar ran right across it from eye to chin, and by its contraction had turned up one side of the upper lip, so that three teeth were exposed in a perpetual snarl. A shock of very bright red hair grew low over his eyes and forehead.\n“He’s a beauty, isn’t he?” said the inspector.\n“He certainly needs a wash,” remarked Holmes. “I had an idea that he might, and I took the liberty of bringing the tools with me.” He opened the Gladstone bag as he spoke, and took out, to my astonishment, a very large bath-sponge.\n“He! he! You are a funny one,” chuckled the inspector.\n“Now, if you will have the great goodness to open that door very quietly, we will soon make him cut a much more respectable figure.”\n“Well, I don’t know why not,” said the inspector. “He doesn’t look a credit to the Bow Street cells, does he?” He slipped his key into the lock, and we all very quietly entered the cell. The sleeper half turned, and then settled down once more into a deep slumber. Holmes stooped to the water-jug, moistened his sponge, and then rubbed it twice vigorously across and down the prisoner’s face.\n“Let me introduce you,” he shouted, “to Mr. Neville St. Clair, of Lee, in the county of Kent.”\nNever in my life have I seen such a sight. The man’s face peeled off under the sponge like the bark from a tree. Gone was the coarse brown tint! Gone, too, was the horrid scar which had seamed it across, and the twisted lip which had given the repulsive sneer to the face! A twitch brought away the tangled red hair, and there, sitting up in his bed, was a pale, sad-faced, refined-looking man, black-haired and smooth-skinned, rubbing his eyes and staring about him with sleepy bewilderment. Then suddenly realising the exposure, he broke into a scream and threw himself down with his face to the pillow.\n“Great heavens!” cried the inspector, “it is, indeed, the missing man. I know him from the photograph.”\nThe prisoner turned with the reckless air of a man who abandons himself to his destiny. “Be it so,” said he. “And pray what am I charged with?”\n“With making away with Mr. Neville St.— Oh, come, you can’t be charged with that unless they make a case of attempted suicide of it,” said the inspector with a grin. “Well, I have been twenty-seven years in the force, but this really takes the cake.”\n“If I am Mr. Neville St. Clair, then it is obvious that no crime has been committed, and that, therefore, I am illegally detained.”\n“No crime, but a very great error has been committed,” said Holmes. “You would have done better to have trusted your wife.”\n“It was not the wife; it was the children,” groaned the prisoner. “God help me, I would not have them ashamed of their father. My God! What an exposure! What can I do?”\nSherlock Holmes sat down beside him on the couch and patted him kindly on the shoulder.\n“If you leave it to a court of law to clear the matter up,” said he, “of course you can hardly avoid publicity. On the other hand, if you convince the police authorities that there is no possible case against you, I do not know that there is any reason that the details should find their way into the papers. Inspector Bradstreet would, I am sure, make notes upon anything which you might tell us and submit it to the proper authorities. The case would then never go into court at all.”\n“God bless you!” cried the prisoner passionately. “I would have endured imprisonment, ay, even execution, rather than have left my miserable secret as a family blot to my children.\n“You are the first who have ever heard my story. My father was a schoolmaster in Chesterfield, where I received an excellent education. I travelled in my youth, took to the stage, and finally became a reporter on an evening paper in London. One day my editor wished to have a series of articles upon begging in the metropolis, and I volunteered to supply them. There was the point from which all my adventures started. It was only by trying begging as an amateur that I could get the facts upon which to base my articles. When an actor I had, of course, learned all the secrets of making up, and had been famous in the green-room for my skill. I took advantage now of my attainments. I painted my face, and to make myself as pitiable as possible I made a good scar and fixed one side of my lip in a twist by the aid of a small slip of flesh-coloured plaster. Then with a red head of hair, and an appropriate dress, I took my station in the business part of the city, ostensibly as a match-seller but really as a beggar. For seven hours I plied my trade, and when I returned home in the evening I found to my surprise that I had received no less than 26s. 4d.\n“I wrote my articles and thought little more of the matter until, some time later, I backed a bill for a friend and had a writ served upon me for £ 25. I was at my wit’s end where to get the money, but a sudden idea came to me. I begged a fortnight’s grace from the creditor, asked for a holiday from my employers, and spent the time in begging in the City under my disguise. In ten days I had the money and had paid the debt.\n“Well, you can imagine how hard it was to settle down to arduous work at £ 2 a week when I knew that I could earn as much in a day by smearing my face with a little paint, laying my cap on the ground, and sitting still. It was a long fight between my pride and the money, but the dollars won at last, and I threw up reporting and sat day after day in the corner which I had first chosen, inspiring pity by my ghastly face and filling my pockets with coppers. Only one man knew my secret. He was the keeper of a low den in which I used to lodge in Swandam Lane, where I could every morning emerge as a squalid beggar and in the evenings transform myself into a well-dressed man about town. This fellow, a Lascar, was well paid by me for his rooms, so that I knew that my secret was safe in his possession.\n“Well, very soon I found that I was saving considerable sums of money. I do not mean that any beggar in the streets of London could earn £ 700 a year—which is less than my average takings—but I had exceptional advantages in my power of making up, and also in a facility of repartee, which improved by practice and made me quite a recognised character in the City. All day a stream of pennies, varied by silver, poured in upon me, and it was a very bad day in which I failed to take £ 2.\n“As I grew richer I grew more ambitious, took a house in the country, and eventually married, without anyone having a suspicion as to my real occupation. My dear wife knew that I had business in the City. She little knew what.\n“Last Monday I had finished for the day and was dressing in my room above the opium den when I looked out of my window and saw, to my horror and astonishment, that my wife was standing in the street, with her eyes fixed full upon me. I gave a cry of surprise, threw up my arms to cover my face, and, rushing to my confidant, the Lascar, entreated him to prevent anyone from coming up to me. I heard her voice downstairs, but I knew that she could not ascend. Swiftly I threw off my clothes, pulled on those of a beggar, and put on my pigments and wig. Even a wife’s eyes could not pierce so complete a disguise. But then it occurred to me that there might be a search in the room, and that the clothes might betray me. I threw open the window, reopening by my violence a small cut which I had inflicted upon myself in the bedroom that morning. Then I seized my coat, which was weighted by the coppers which I had just transferred to it from the leather bag in which I carried my takings. I hurled it out of the window, and it disappeared into the Thames. The other clothes would have followed, but at that moment there was a rush of constables up the stair, and a few minutes after I found, rather, I confess, to my relief, that instead of being identified as Mr. Neville St. Clair, I was arrested as his murderer.\n“I do not know that there is anything else for me to explain. I was determined to preserve my disguise as long as possible, and hence my preference for a dirty face. Knowing that my wife would be terribly anxious, I slipped off my ring and confided it to the Lascar at a moment when no constable was watching me, together with a hurried scrawl, telling her that she had no cause to fear.”\n“That note only reached her yesterday,” said Holmes.\n“Good God! What a week she must have spent!”\n“The police have watched this Lascar,” said Inspector Bradstreet, “and I can quite understand that he might find it difficult to post a letter unobserved. Probably he handed it to some sailor customer of his, who forgot all about it for some days.”\n“That was it,” said Holmes, nodding approvingly; “I have no doubt of it. But have you never been prosecuted for begging?”\n“Many times; but what was a fine to me?”\n“It must stop here, however,” said Bradstreet. “If the police are to hush this thing up, there must be no more of Hugh Boone.”\n“I have sworn it by the most solemn oaths which a man can take.”\n“In that case I think that it is probable that no further steps may be taken. But if you are found again, then all must come out. I am sure, Mr. Holmes, that we are very much indebted to you for having cleared the matter up. I wish I knew how you reach your results.”\n“I reached this one,” said my friend, “by sitting upon five pillows and consuming an ounce of shag. I think, Watson, that if we drive to Baker Street we shall just be in time for breakfast.”",

            "prefix-probing": "The pipe was still between his lips, the smoke still curled upward, and the room was full of a dense tobacco haze, but nothing remained of the heap of shag which I had seen upon the previous night. Holmes sat in his usual attitude, with his long, thin fingers interlaced, and his eyes fixed upon the fire. The clock on the mantelpiece ticked steadily, and the rain pattered against the window-pane. I could see that he was deep in thought, his brow slightly furrowed, and his lips pressed together in concentration.\n\n\"You have been pondering over the case, Holmes?\" I ventured, breaking the silence.\n\nHe looked up, and a faint smile played upon his lips. \"Indeed, Watson. The matter is more intricate than it first appeared. The disappearance of the young lady, Miss Violet Hunter, is not a mere flight of fancy or a simple elopement. There are darker forces at work, and I intend to unravel them.\"\n\nI nodded, eager to assist in any way I could. Holmes rose from his chair and began to pace the room, his eyes gleaming with the fire of intellectual excitement.\n\n\"The key lies in the details, Watson. The letter she received, the strange behavior of her employer, and the peculiar circumstances surrounding the estate all point to a hidden motive. We must visit the scene of the mystery and observe with our own eyes.\"\n\nThe next morning, we set out for the countryside, where the estate of Holdernesse Hall lay nestled among rolling hills and ancient woods. The carriage ride was pleasant, and the fresh air invigorated us both. Upon arrival, we were greeted by the housekeeper, a stern woman with sharp eyes and a guarded demeanor.\n\n\"Miss Hunter is not here,\" she informed us curtly. \"She left early this morning, without a word.\"\n\nHolmes exchanged a glance with me, his expression unreadable. \"We must search her room,\" he said decisively.\n\nInside, the room was neat and orderly, but a careful examination revealed a hidden compartment beneath the floorboards. Within it lay a bundle of letters and a small, ornate box. Holmes opened the box to find a collection of old coins and a faded photograph of a man and a woman, their faces stern and somber.\n\n\"Curious,\" Holmes murmured. \"These artifacts suggest a connection to a family secret, perhaps a long-buried scandal.\"\n\nWe spent the day exploring the grounds and questioning the servants, piecing together fragments of information. The gardener spoke of strange noises at night, and the cook mentioned a locked wing of the house that no one dared enter.\n\nAs dusk fell, we approached the forbidden wing, its windows dark and foreboding. Holmes produced a key he had found among the letters and unlocked the heavy door. Inside, we discovered a dusty study filled with books and papers, many of which bore the name Holdernesse.\n\nAmong the documents was a diary, its pages yellowed with age. Holmes read aloud passages that spoke of betrayal, lost love, and a hidden treasure. The plot thickened, and the mystery deepened.\n\nSuddenly, a noise behind us startled us both. We turned to see a shadowy figure retreating down the corridor. Holmes gave chase, but the figure vanished into the night.\n\nReturning to the main hall, we found the housekeeper waiting, her face pale. \"You must leave at once,\" she urged. \"Danger lurks here, and you are not safe.\"\n\nHolmes smiled grimly. \"On the contrary, madam, we are just beginning to uncover the truth.\"\n\nThe following days were filled with investigation, each clue leading us closer to the heart of the enigma. The interplay of human passions, secrets, and deceptions unfolded before us like a complex tapestry.\n\nIn the end, it was the keen observation of a small detail—a misplaced button, a faint scent, a whispered confession—that allowed Holmes to solve the case. The missing Miss Hunter was found safe, and the dark secrets of Holdernesse Hall were brought to light.\n\nAs we departed, Holmes turned to me with a satisfied expression. \"Once again, Watson, we have demonstrated that no mystery is beyond the reach of reason and perseverance.\"\n\nI could only agree, grateful to have witnessed the triumph of intellect over intrigue."

          "text_segment": "I had called upon my friend Sherlock Holmes upon the second morning after Christmas, with the intention of wishing him the compliments of the season. He was lounging upon the sofa in a purple dressing-gown, a pipe-rack within his reach upon the right, and a pile of crumpled morning papers, evidently newly studied, near at hand. Beside the couch was a wooden chair, and on the angle of the back hung a very seedy and disreputable hard-felt hat, much the worse for wear, and cracked in several places. A lens and a forceps lying upon the seat of the chair suggested that the hat had been suspended in this manner for the purpose of examination.\n“You are engaged,” said I; “perhaps I interrupt you.”\n“Not at all. I am glad to have a friend with whom I can discuss my results. The matter is a perfectly trivial one”—he jerked his thumb in the direction of the old hat—“but there are points in connection with it which are not entirely devoid of interest and even of instruction.”\nI seated myself in his armchair and warmed my hands before his crackling fire, for a sharp frost had set in, and the windows were thick with the ice crystals. “I suppose,” I remarked, “that, homely as it looks, this thing has some deadly story linked on to it—that it is the clue which will guide you in the solution of some mystery and the punishment of some crime.”\n“No, no. No crime,” said Sherlock Holmes, laughing. “Only one of those whimsical little incidents which will happen when you have four million human beings all jostling each other within the space of a few square miles. Amid the action and reaction of so dense a swarm of humanity, every possible combination of events may be expected to take place, and many a little problem will be presented which may be striking and bizarre without being criminal. We have already had experience of such.”\n“So much so,” I remarked, “that of the last six cases which I have added to my notes, three have been entirely free of any legal crime.”\n“Precisely. You allude to my attempt to recover the Irene Adler papers, to the singular case of Miss Mary Sutherland, and to the adventure of the man with the twisted lip. Well, I have no doubt that this small matter will fall into the same innocent category. You know Peterson, the commissionaire?”\n“Yes.”\n“It is to him that this trophy belongs.”\n“It is his hat.”\n“No, no, he found it. Its owner is unknown. I beg that you will look upon it not as a battered billycock but as an intellectual problem. And, first, as to how it came here. It arrived upon Christmas morning, in company with a good fat goose, which is, I have no doubt, roasting at this moment in front of Peterson’s fire. The facts are these: about four o’clock on Christmas morning, Peterson, who, as you know, is a very honest fellow, was returning from some small jollification and was making his way homeward down Tottenham Court Road. In front of him he saw, in the gaslight, a tallish man, walking with a slight stagger, and carrying a white goose slung over his shoulder. As he reached the corner of Goodge Street, a row broke out between this stranger and a little knot of roughs. One of the latter knocked off the man’s hat, on which he raised his stick to defend himself and, swinging it over his head, smashed the shop window behind him. Peterson had rushed forward to protect the stranger from his assailants; but the man, shocked at having broken the window, and seeing an official-looking person in uniform rushing towards him, dropped his goose, took to his heels, and vanished amid the labyrinth of small streets which lie at the back of Tottenham Court Road. The roughs had also fled at the appearance of Peterson, so that he was left in possession of the field of battle, and also of the spoils of victory in the shape of this battered hat and a most unimpeachable Christmas goose.”\n“Which surely he restored to their owner?”\n“My dear fellow, there lies the problem. It is true that ‘For Mrs. Henry Baker’ was printed upon a small card which was tied to the bird’s left leg, and it is also true that the initials ‘H. B.’ are legible upon the lining of this hat, but as there are some thousands of Bakers, and some hundreds of Henry Bakers in this city of ours, it is not easy to restore lost property to any one of them.”\n“What, then, did Peterson do?”\n“He brought round both hat and goose to me on Christmas morning, knowing that even the smallest problems are of interest to me. The goose we retained until this morning, when there were signs that, in spite of the slight frost, it would be well that it should be eaten without unnecessary delay. Its finder has carried it off, therefore, to fulfil the ultimate destiny of a goose, while I continue to retain the hat of the unknown gentleman who lost his Christmas dinner.”",

            "prefix-probing": "I had called upon my friend Sherlock Holmes upon the second morning after Christmas, with the intention of wishing him the compliments of the season. He was in deep conversation with a visitor, a tall, thin man with a hawk-like nose and keen eyes that seemed to miss nothing. Holmes greeted me with his usual warmth, but his mind was evidently occupied.\n\n\"Ah, Watson,\" he said, \"just the man I wished to see. This gentleman has brought a most perplexing case to my attention.\"\n\nThe visitor introduced himself as Mr. James Mortimer, a country gentleman from the West Country. He explained that he had come to London seeking Holmes's assistance in a matter that had baffled the local authorities.\n\n\"It concerns the Baskerville estate,\" Mr. Mortimer began, \"a vast property in Devonshire, shrouded in mystery and fear. The family has been haunted by a legend of a monstrous hound, a creature of supernatural origin said to curse the Baskerville line.\"\n\nHolmes listened intently as Mr. Mortimer recounted the tale of Sir Charles Baskerville, the recently deceased baronet, whose death had been attributed to a heart attack but was surrounded by strange circumstances. The locals whispered of a spectral hound seen prowling the moors on the night of his demise.\n\n\"I have come to London to seek your help, Mr. Holmes,\" said Mr. Mortimer. \"The heir to the estate, Sir Henry Baskerville, is arriving from Canada, and I fear for his safety. The legend may be more than mere superstition.\"\n\nHolmes's eyes gleamed with interest. \"This is indeed a case worthy of our attention, Watson. The interplay of legend and reality often conceals a more earthly truth.\"\n\nWe agreed to accompany Mr. Mortimer to Baskerville Hall, to investigate the circumstances surrounding Sir Charles's death and to protect Sir Henry from any harm.\n\nUpon arriving at the estate, we were greeted by the gloomy moorlands, shrouded in mist and silence. The atmosphere was heavy with an eerie stillness, broken only by the distant howling of the wind.\n\nSir Henry Baskerville was a young man of robust constitution and cheerful demeanor, though he bore the weight of the family curse with a certain stoicism. He had received a warning letter, ominous in tone, cautioning him to stay away from the moor.\n\nHolmes and I set about our inquiries, interviewing the local inhabitants, including the loyal but secretive servants of Baskerville Hall, the naturalist Stapleton and his sister, and the various farmers and shepherds who tended the moor.\n\nStrange occurrences began to unfold: footprints of a gigantic hound were found near the estate, eerie cries echoed across the moor at night, and Sir Henry narrowly escaped an attempt on his life.\n\nHolmes's keen intellect pieced together the clues, revealing a plot rooted not in the supernatural, but in greed and deception. The legend of the hound was a cunning ruse employed to mask a human villain's machinations.\n\nIn a dramatic confrontation on the desolate moor, Holmes exposed the culprit, unmasking the true nature of the menace that had haunted the Baskerville family.\n\nThe case concluded with justice served, the curse dispelled, and Sir Henry safe to inherit his ancestral home. As we departed Baskerville Hall, the moor seemed less foreboding, the shadows lifted by the light of reason and truth.\n\nReflecting on the adventure, I marveled at Holmes's unparalleled deductive powers and his unwavering commitment to uncovering the facts beneath the veil of superstition. The Baskerville mystery had tested our resolve and intellect, but ultimately, it was the triumph of logic over fear that prevailed."

          "text_segment": "“Did he not advertise?”\n“No.”\n“Then, what clue could you have as to his identity?”\n“Only as much as we can deduce.”\n“From his hat?”\n“Precisely.”\n“But you are joking. What can you gather from this old battered felt?”\n“Here is my lens. You know my methods. What can you gather yourself as to the individuality of the man who has worn this article?”\nI took the tattered object in my hands and turned it over rather ruefully. It was a very ordinary black hat of the usual round shape, hard and much the worse for wear. The lining had been of red silk, but was a good deal discoloured. There was no maker’s name; but, as Holmes had remarked, the initials “H. B.” were scrawled upon one side. It was pierced in the brim for a hat-securer, but the elastic was missing. For the rest, it was cracked, exceedingly dusty, and spotted in several places, although there seemed to have been some attempt to hide the discoloured patches by smearing them with ink.\n“I can see nothing,” said I, handing it back to my friend.\n“On the contrary, Watson, you can see everything. You fail, however, to reason from what you see. You are too timid in drawing your inferences.”\n“Then, pray tell me what it is that you can infer from this hat?”\nHe picked it up and gazed at it in the peculiar introspective fashion which was characteristic of him. “It is perhaps less suggestive than it might have been,” he remarked, “and yet there are a few inferences which are very distinct, and a few others which represent at least a strong balance of probability. That the man was highly intellectual is of course obvious upon the face of it, and also that he was fairly well-to-do within the last three years, although he has now fallen upon evil days. He had foresight, but has less now than formerly, pointing to a moral retrogression, which, when taken with the decline of his fortunes, seems to indicate some evil influence, probably drink, at work upon him. This may account also for the obvious fact that his wife has ceased to love him.”\n“My dear Holmes!”\n“He has, however, retained some degree of self-respect,” he continued, disregarding my remonstrance. “He is a man who leads a sedentary life, goes out little, is out of training entirely, is middle-aged, has grizzled hair which he has had cut within the last few days, and which he anoints with lime-cream. These are the more patent facts which are to be deduced from his hat. Also, by the way, that it is extremely improbable that he has gas laid on in his house.”\n“You are certainly joking, Holmes.”\n“Not in the least. Is it possible that even now, when I give you these results, you are unable to see how they are attained?”\n“I have no doubt that I am very stupid, but I must confess that I am unable to follow you. For example, how did you deduce that this man was intellectual?”\nFor answer Holmes clapped the hat upon his head. It came right over the forehead and settled upon the bridge of his nose. “It is a question of cubic capacity,” said he; “a man with so large a brain must have something in it.”\n“The decline of his fortunes, then?”\n“This hat is three years old. These flat brims curled at the edge came in then. It is a hat of the very best quality. Look at the band of ribbed silk and the excellent lining. If this man could afford to buy so expensive a hat three years ago, and has had no hat since, then he has assuredly gone down in the world.”\n“Well, that is clear enough, certainly. But how about the foresight and the moral retrogression?”\nSherlock Holmes laughed. “Here is the foresight,” said he putting his finger upon the little disc and loop of the hat-securer. “They are never sold upon hats. If this man ordered one, it is a sign of a certain amount of foresight, since he went out of his way to take this precaution against the wind. But since we see that he has broken the elastic and has not troubled to replace it, it is obvious that he has less foresight now than formerly, which is a distinct proof of a weakening nature. On the other hand, he has endeavoured to conceal some of these stains upon the felt by daubing them with ink, which is a sign that he has not entirely lost his self-respect.”\n“Your reasoning is certainly plausible.”\n“The further points, that he is middle-aged, that his hair is grizzled, that it has been recently cut, and that he uses lime-cream, are all to be gathered from a close examination of the lower part of the lining. The lens discloses a large number of hair-ends, clean cut by the scissors of the barber. They all appear to be adhesive, and there is a distinct odour of lime-cream. This dust, you will observe, is not the gritty, grey dust of the street but the fluffy brown dust of the house, showing that it has been hung up indoors most of the time, while the marks of moisture upon the inside are proof positive that the wearer perspired very freely, and could therefore, hardly be in the best of training.”\n“But his wife—you said that she had ceased to love him.”\n“This hat has not been brushed for weeks. When I see you, my dear Watson, with a week’s accumulation of dust upon your hat, and when your wife allows you to go out in such a state, I shall fear that you also have been unfortunate enough to lose your wife’s affection.”\n“But he might be a bachelor.”\n“Nay, he was bringing home the goose as a peace-offering to his wife. Remember the card upon the bird’s leg.”\n“You have an answer to everything. But how on earth do you deduce that the gas is not laid on in his house?”\n“One tallow stain, or even two, might come by chance; but when I see no less than five, I think that there can be little doubt that the individual must be brought into frequent contact with burning tallow—walks upstairs at night probably with his hat in one hand and a guttering candle in the other. Anyhow, he never got tallow-stains from a gas-jet. Are you satisfied?”\n“Well, it is very ingenious,” said I, laughing; “but since, as you said just now, there has been no crime committed, and no harm done save the loss of a goose, all this seems to be rather a waste of energy.”\nSherlock Holmes had opened his mouth to reply, when the door flew open, and Peterson, the commissionaire, rushed into the apartment with flushed cheeks and the face of a man who is dazed with astonishment.",

              "simple_agent_extraction": "\"Did he not advertise?\" asked Holmes.\n\n\"No.\"\n\n\"Then we have no clue to his identity save what we can deduce from the hat itself.\"\n\nI took the battered black felt hat from his hand and examined it. It was a common enough article, with a rather wide brim, and a red silk lining which was discoloured and spotted with ink. The initials \"H. B.\" were worked in black silk upon the lining. It was pierced for a missing hat-securer, and was dusty and somewhat crushed.\n\n\"Well, Watson, what do you make of it?\"\n\n\"I see nothing very remarkable about it.\"\n\n\"You see, but you do not observe.\"\n\n\"I observe,\" said I, \"that it is a black felt hat, with a red silk lining, and the initials 'H. B.'\"\n\n\"To you,\" said he, \"that is not observation. Now, I ask you, what do you deduce?\"\n\n\"I deduce that the man who wore this hat was a man of some means, who has fallen on hard times.\"\n\n\"Good! But how do you know that?\"\n\n\"Because the hat is of good quality, but it is old and worn.\"\n\n\"Exactly. The hat is of a good make, and was bought about three years ago. Since then, no new hat has been purchased, which shows a decline in circumstances. The man was once well off, but is now in reduced circumstances.\"\n\n\"But what of the hat-securer?\"\n\n\"Ah! The hat-securer loop is present, but the elastic is broken and unrepaired. This shows a man who once had foresight and cared for his belongings, but who has since become careless, perhaps through some evil influence such as drink.\"\n\n\"And the initials?\"\n\n\"They are 'H. B.', which may be the man's initials.\"\n\n\"What of the stains and dust?\"\n\n\"The hat is dusty and spotted with ink, and the lining is discoloured. The dust is of a peculiar type, and there are marks of perspiration.

                "text": "\"Did he not advertise?\" asked Holmes.\n\n\"No.\"\n\n\"Then we have no clue to his identity save what we can deduce from the hat itself.\"\n\nI took the battered black felt hat from his hand and examined it. It was a common enough article, with a rather wide brim, and a red silk lining which was discoloured and spotted with ink. The initials \"H. B.\" were worked in black silk upon the lining. It was pierced for a missing hat-securer, and was dusty and somewhat crushed.\n\n\"Well, Watson, what do you make of it?\"\n\n\"I see nothing very remarkable about it.\"\n\n\"You see, but you do not observe.\"\n\n\"I observe,\" said I, \"that it is a black felt hat, with a red silk lining, and the initials 'H. B.'\"\n\n\"To you,\" said he, \"that is not observation. Now, I ask you, what do you deduce?\"\n\n\"I deduce that the man who wore this hat was a man of some means, who has fallen on hard times.\"\n\n\"Good! But how do you know that?\"\n\n\"Because the hat is of good quality, but it is old and worn.\"\n\n\"Exactly. The hat is of a good make, and was bought about three years ago. Since then, no new hat has been purchased, which shows a decline in circumstances. The man was once well off, but is now in reduced circumstances.\"\n\n\"But what of the hat-securer?\"\n\n\"Ah! The hat-securer loop is present, but the elastic is broken and unrepaired. This shows a man who once had foresight and cared for his belongings, but who has since become careless, perhaps through some evil influence such as drink.\"\n\n\"And the initials?\"\n\n\"They are 'H. B.', which may be the man's initials.\"\n\n\"What of the stains and dust?\"\n\n\"The hat is dusty and spotted with ink, and the lining is discoloured. The dust is of a peculiar type, and there are marks of perspiration. The hair clippings in the lining show that the man is middle-aged, with grizzled hair recently cut and anointed with lime-cream.\"\n\n\"And the tallow stains?\"\n\n\"They suggest that the man does not have gas lighting in his house, but uses candles regularly.\"\n\n\"But what of the man's character?\"\n\n\"He is a man who retains some self-respect, as shown by his attempt to cover the stains with ink.

            "prefix-probing": "“Did he not advertise?” I asked.\n\n“Not a line,” said Holmes. “He was a man of some means, and he had no need to seek employment. But the fact remains that he has disappeared, and the mystery is a deep one.”\n\nI looked at Holmes with interest. The case had already begun to intrigue me, and I was eager to hear more.\n\n“Tell me, Holmes,” I said, “what do you make of the whole affair?”\n\nHolmes steepled his fingers and leaned back in his chair. “It is a curious case, Watson. The man, Mr. John Openshaw, vanished without a trace. His family is in a state of great distress, and the police have been unable to find any clue as to his whereabouts.”\n\n“Have you any theories?”\n\n“Several, but none that I can yet confirm. The key lies in the circumstances surrounding his disappearance. He was last seen at his home, preparing to leave for a journey. Yet no one saw him depart, and no luggage was found.”\n\n“Strange indeed.”\n\n“Moreover,” Holmes continued, “there is the matter of the mysterious letter he received the day before his disappearance. It was unsigned, but contained a cryptic message that seemed to unsettle him greatly.”\n\n“Have you seen the letter?”\n\nHolmes nodded. “Yes, and I have made a copy. It reads: ‘The game is afoot. Trust no one. The past will catch up with you.’”\n\nI shuddered. “It sounds like a threat.”\n\n“Precisely. And it suggests that Mr. Openshaw was involved in something dangerous, perhaps connected to events long ago.”\n\n“Do you think he fled to escape this danger?”\n\n“Possibly. Or he may have been taken against his will. The lack of evidence makes it difficult to say.”\n\n“Have you any suspects?”\n\nHolmes smiled faintly. “I have my suspicions, but I must gather more information before I can act.”\n\n“Then let us begin at once,” I said eagerly.\n\nHolmes nodded. “We shall visit the Openshaw residence and speak with the family. Perhaps they can shed light on the matter.”\n\nWe set out immediately, and upon arriving at the house, we were greeted by a distraught woman, Mrs. Openshaw.\n\n“Mr. Holmes,” she said, “I am grateful that you have come. My husband’s disappearance has left us all in despair.”\n\nHolmes offered his condolences and began to ask questions about Mr. Openshaw’s habits, acquaintances, and recent activities.\n\n“He was a quiet man,” Mrs. Openshaw explained, “but lately he seemed troubled. He received letters, but would not show them to me.”\n\n“Did he mention any enemies or threats?”\n\n“No, but he was secretive. I fear he was hiding something.”\n\nHolmes examined the room and noticed a small, folded piece of paper on the floor. He picked it up carefully.\n\n“This may be of interest,” he said. “It appears to be a fragment of a map.”\n\nMrs. Openshaw looked surprised. “I have never seen that before.”\n\nHolmes studied the fragment closely. “It shows a portion of the countryside near Dartmoor. Perhaps Mr. Openshaw intended to visit this area.”\n\n“Dartmoor?” I exclaimed. “That is a wild and desolate place.”\n\n“Indeed,” Holmes agreed. “But it may hold the key to the mystery.”\n\nWe decided to travel to Dartmoor to investigate further. Upon arrival, we sought out local inns and questioned the inhabitants about any strangers or unusual occurrences.\n\nAt the Fox and Hounds Inn, the landlord recalled seeing a man matching Mr. Openshaw’s description.\n\n“He came here a few days ago,” the landlord said. “He seemed anxious and kept to himself.”\n\n“Did he mention where he was going?”\n\n“No, but he carried a small satchel and a folded map.”\n\nHolmes’s eyes gleamed. “That confirms our suspicions.”\n\nWe set out into the moor, following the clues from the map fragment. The terrain was rugged and the weather harsh, but Holmes was undeterred.\n\nAfter several hours, we came upon an old stone hut, partially hidden among the rocks.\n\n“Here we are,” Holmes said. “Let us see if Mr. Openshaw is here.”\n\nWe approached cautiously and knocked on the door. There was no answer.\n\nHolmes pushed the door open and we entered. Inside, the hut was sparsely furnished, but there were signs of recent habitation.\n\nOn a table lay a journal, which Holmes picked up and began to read.\n\n“It appears Mr. Openshaw has been living here,” Holmes said. “His entries speak of a secret he uncovered, something that has put him in danger.”\n\n“Can you read some of it?” I asked.\n\nHolmes nodded. “Listen to this: ‘I have found the key to the Openshaw family’s past, a secret that has been buried for generations. If it falls into the wrong hands, it could ruin us all.’”\n\n“Fascinating,” I said.\n\nHolmes continued to read, piecing together the story of a long-forgotten treasure and a family feud.\n\nSuddenly, we heard footsteps outside. Holmes motioned for silence and drew his revolver.\n\nThe door burst open and a man entered, his face twisted with anger.\n\n“Who are you?” he demanded.\n\nHolmes stepped forward. “I am Sherlock Holmes, and this is my companion, Dr. Watson. We seek Mr. Openshaw.”\n\nThe man sneered. “He is not here, and you would do well to leave before you get hurt.”\n\nHolmes’s eyes narrowed. “I think you are the one who has taken him.”\n\nThe man lunged at Holmes, but Holmes was quick and disarmed him.\n\n“Tell us where Mr. Openshaw is,” Holmes commanded.\n\nThe man broke down and confessed. He was a rival claimant to the Openshaw inheritance and had kidnapped Mr. Openshaw to force him to relinquish his claim.\n\nHolmes called the local constable, and the man was taken into custody.\n\nWe found Mr. Openshaw hidden in a nearby cave, weak but unharmed.\n\nThe mystery was solved, and justice was served.\n\nAs we returned to London, I reflected on the case and the brilliance of my friend.\n\n“Holmes,” I said, “once again you have demonstrated the power of observation and deduction.”\n\nHe smiled modestly. “It is all in a day’s work, Watson.”\n\nAnd so ended another adventure in the chronicles of Sherlock Holmes."

Has it returned to life and flapped off through the kitchen window?” Holmes twisted himself round upon the sofa to get a fairer view of the man’s excited face.\n“See here, sir! See what my wife found in its crop!” He held out his hand and displayed upon the centre of the palm a brilliantly scintillating blue stone, rather smaller than a bean in size, but of such purity and radiance that it twinkled like an electric point in the dark hollow of his hand.\nSherlock Holmes sat up with a whistle. “By Jove, Peterson!” said he, “this is treasure trove indeed. I suppose you know what you have got?”\n“A diamond, sir? A precious stone. It cuts into glass as though it were putty.”\n“It’s more than a precious stone. It is the precious stone.”\n“Not the Countess of Morcar’s blue carbuncle!” I ejaculated.\n“Precisely so. I ought to know its size and shape, seeing that I have read the advertisement about it in The Times every day lately. It is absolutely unique, and its value can only be conjectured, but the reward offered of £ 1000 is certainly not within a twentieth part of the market price.”\n“A thousand pounds! Great Lord of mercy!” The commissionaire plumped down into a chair and stared from one to the other of us.\n“That is the reward, and I have reason to know that there are sentimental considerations in the background which would induce the Countess to part with half her fortune if she could but recover the gem.”\n“It was lost, if I remember aright, at the Hotel Cosmopolitan,” I remarked.\n“Precisely so, on December 22nd, just five days ago. John Horner, a plumber, was accused of having abstracted it from the lady’s jewel-case. The evidence against him was so strong that the case has been referred to the Assizes. I have some account of the matter here, I believe.” He rummaged amid his newspapers, glancing over the dates, until at last he smoothed one out, doubled it over, and read the following paragraph:\n“Hotel Cosmopolitan Jewel Robbery. John Horner, 26, plumber, was brought up upon the charge of having upon the 22nd inst., abstracted from the jewel-case of the Countess of Morcar the valuable gem known as the blue carbuncle. James Ryder, upper-attendant at the hotel, gave his evidence to the effect that he had shown Horner up to the dressing-room of the Countess of Morcar upon the day of the robbery in order that he might solder the second bar of the grate, which was loose. He had remained with Horner some little time, but had finally been called away. On returning, he found that Horner had disappeared, that the bureau had been forced open, and that the small morocco casket in which, as it afterwards transpired, the Countess was accustomed to keep her jewel, was lying empty upon the dressing-table. Ryder instantly gave the alarm, and Horner was arrested the same evening; but the stone could not be found either upon his person or in his rooms. Catherine Cusack, maid to the Countess, deposed to having heard Ryder’s cry of dismay on discovering the robbery, and to having rushed into the room, where she found matters as described by the last witness. Inspector Bradstreet, B division, gave evidence as to the arrest of Horner, who struggled frantically, and protested his innocence in the strongest terms. Evidence of a previous conviction for robbery having been given against the prisoner, the magistrate refused to deal summarily with the offence, but referred it to the Assizes. Horner, who had shown signs of intense emotion during the proceedings, fainted away at the conclusion and was carried out of court.”",

            "prefix-probing": "“The goose, Mr. Holmes! The goose, sir!” he gasped.\n\nSherlock Holmes looked up sharply from the intricate puzzle he was examining, his keen eyes narrowing with interest. The room was thick with the scent of pipe smoke and the faint aroma of the evening meal, but the urgency in the visitor’s voice cut through the mundane atmosphere like a knife.\n\n“Calm yourself, my good man,” Holmes said, his voice steady but commanding. “Tell me exactly what has happened with this goose.”\n\nThe man, a stout fellow with a flushed face and trembling hands, took a deep breath and began. “It was last night, sir. I was returning home late from the market when I noticed something peculiar in the alley behind my shop. There, amidst the shadows, I saw a figure struggling with a large goose. The bird was flapping wildly, and the man seemed desperate to keep it quiet.”\n\nHolmes leaned forward, his fingers steepled beneath his chin. “Did you recognize the man?”\n\n“No, sir. He wore a dark cloak and a wide-brimmed hat pulled low over his face. But what struck me was the way he handled the goose — not roughly, but with a strange tenderness, as if the bird were more than just a prize.”\n\n“Interesting,” murmured Holmes. “And what became of the goose?”\n\nThe man swallowed hard. “That’s the strange part, Mr. Holmes. The next morning, the goose was found dead in the alley, its neck broken, but no sign of a struggle or any wounds beyond that. The neighbors say it was a bad omen, but I fear there is more to it.”\n\nHolmes stood abruptly, his eyes gleaming with excitement. “Watson, fetch my coat and hat. We have a mystery to unravel.”\n\nAs they stepped into the fog-laden streets of London, Holmes explained his thoughts. “The goose is a symbol, Watson. In folklore, it often represents vigilance and courage. The manner of its death suggests a message, perhaps a warning.”\n\nThey arrived at the alley, now bathed in the pale light of dawn. Holmes examined the scene meticulously, noting the absence of footprints or any signs of disturbance. “The perpetrator was careful, deliberate. This was no random act of cruelty.”\n\nSuddenly, Holmes’s gaze fixed upon a small, crumpled piece of paper near the bird’s body. He picked it up with tweezers, unfolding it carefully. The note bore a cryptic message: “The watchful eye sees all.”\n\n“Watson, this confirms my suspicion. Someone is sending a message to a particular individual, using the goose as a symbol. We must find out who the intended recipient is.”\n\nTheir investigation led them to a nearby tavern, where the shopkeeper’s neighbors gathered. Holmes questioned them about any recent disputes or unusual visitors. An elderly woman mentioned a stranger who had been asking about the shopkeeper’s schedule and habits.\n\nHolmes and Watson followed this lead to a shadowy figure who frequented the docks. After a tense confrontation, the man confessed to orchestrating the goose’s death as a warning to the shopkeeper, who had unwittingly come into possession of sensitive information.\n\nThe case resolved, Holmes reflected on the peculiar use of symbolism in crime. “Even the simplest of creatures can become instruments of intrigue, Watson. It is our task to decipher their language.”\n\nAs they returned to Baker Street, the morning sun breaking through the London mist, Holmes’s mind was already turning to the next mystery, ever vigilant, ever curious."

You see, Watson, our little deductions have suddenly assumed a much more important and less innocent aspect. Here is the stone; the stone came from the goose, and the goose came from Mr. Henry Baker, the gentleman with the bad hat and all the other characteristics with which I have bored you. So now we must set ourselves very seriously to finding this gentleman and ascertaining what part he has played in this little mystery. To do this, we must try the simplest means first, and these lie undoubtedly in an advertisement in all the evening papers. If this fail, I shall have recourse to other methods.”\n“What will you say?”\n“Give me a pencil and that slip of paper. Now, then: ‘Found at the corner of Goodge Street, a goose and a black felt hat. Mr. Henry Baker can have the same by applying at 6:30 this evening at 221B, Baker Street.’ That is clear and concise.”\n“Very. But will he see it?”\n“Well, he is sure to keep an eye on the papers, since, to a poor man, the loss was a heavy one. He was clearly so scared by his mischance in breaking the window and by the approach of Peterson that he thought of nothing but flight, but since then he must have bitterly regretted the impulse which caused him to drop his bird. Then, again, the introduction of his name will cause him to see it, for everyone who knows him will direct his attention to it. Here you are, Peterson, run down to the advertising agency and have this put in the evening papers.”\n“In which, sir?”\n“Oh, in the Globe, Star, Pall Mall, St. James’s Gazette, Evening News, Standard, Echo, and any others that occur to you.”\n“Very well, sir. And this stone?”\n“Ah, yes, I shall keep the stone. Thank you. And, I say, Peterson, just buy a goose on your way back and leave it here with me, for we must have one to give to this gentleman in place of the one which your family is now devouring.”\nWhen the commissionaire had gone, Holmes took up the stone and held it against the light. “It’s a bonny thing,” said he. “Just see how it glints and sparkles. Of course it is a nucleus and focus of crime. Every good stone is. They are the devil’s pet baits. In the larger and older jewels every facet may stand for a bloody deed. This stone is not yet twenty years old. It was found in the banks of the Amoy River in southern China and is remarkable in having every characteristic of the carbuncle, save that it is blue in shade instead of ruby red. In spite of its youth, it has already a sinister history. There have been two murders, a vitriol-throwing, a suicide, and several robberies brought about for the sake of this forty-grain weight of crystallised charcoal. Who would think that so pretty a toy would be a purveyor to the gallows and the prison? I’ll lock it up in my strong box now and drop a line to the Countess to say that we have it.”\n“Do you think that this man Horner is innocent?”\n“I cannot tell.”\n“Well, then, do you imagine that this other one, Henry Baker, had anything to do with the matter?”\n“It is, I think, much more likely that Henry Baker is an absolutely innocent man, who had no idea that the bird which he was carrying was of considerably more value than if it were made of solid gold. That, however, I shall determine by a very simple test if we have an answer to our advertisement.”\n“And you can do nothing until then?”\n“Nothing.”\n“In that case I shall continue my professional round. But I shall come back in the evening at the hour you have mentioned, for I should like to see the solution of so tangled a business.”\n“Very glad to see you. I dine at seven. There is a woodcock, I believe. By the way, in view of recent occurrences, perhaps I ought to ask Mrs. Hudson to examine its crop.”",

                "refinement_prompt": "IMPROVEMENT GUIDANCE:\n1. MAJOR STRUCTURAL ISSUES:\n- The completion omits a significant portion of the dialogue between Holmes and Watson, especially the back-and-forth about the advertisement wording and the logistics of placing it. The original contains a detailed exchange about the exact content of the advertisement and the newspapers in which it should be placed, which is condensed or skipped in the completion.\n- The completion invents a scene where Holmes hands the gem to Peterson for safekeeping, which does not occur in the original. This is an invented action and misrepresents the handling of the stone.\n\n2. MISSING ELEMENTS:\n- The step-by-step process of composing the advertisement, including Holmes requesting writing materials and dictating the message, is missing.\n- The list of specific newspapers for the advertisement is omitted; only a general reference is made.\n- The original contains a direct instruction to Peterson to purchase a replacement goose, which is only briefly and vaguely referenced in the completion.\n- The detailed description of the stone’s history, including specific incidents associated with it, is summarized and lacks the enumeration of events found in the original.\n- The original includes Holmes’s intention to write to the Countess, which is only briefly mentioned without the same context.\n- The closing exchange about dinner plans and the suggestion to examine the dinner bird’s crop is condensed and lacks the original’s detail and context.\n\n3. INACCURATE ELEMENTS:\n- The sequence of events is altered: the completion has Holmes hand the stone to Peterson, which is not accurate to the original order of actions.\n- The completion attributes a \"faint smile\" to Holmes and has him \"chuckle as he rose,\" which are not present in the original and change the tone of the ending.\n- The completion generalizes Holmes’s reasoning about Baker’s innocence and the test he plans, omitting the specific method Holmes intends to use.\n- The completion’s summary of the stone’s history is less precise, omitting the specific types and number of crimes associated with it.\n- The transition between Watson’s departure and Holmes’s dinner plans is less clear and omits the original’s time-specific details."

            "prefix-probing": "“Hum! So much for the police-court,” said Holmes thoughtfully, tossing aside the paper. “It seems that the case of the missing ruby is more tangled than I had anticipated. The official reports are as usual, full of conjecture and little in the way of solid fact.”\n\nI looked up from my chair, intrigued by his sudden seriousness. Holmes had been unusually quiet since the morning, his keen eyes fixed upon the fire as if it held the secrets of the universe.\n\n“Have you any new theories, Holmes?” I asked.\n\nHe nodded slowly. “Indeed, Watson. The key lies not in the obvious suspects, but in the subtle details overlooked by the police. For instance, the manner in which the window was forced open is inconsistent with a common burglary.”\n\n“Why do you say that?”\n\n“Because, my dear fellow, the glass was broken from the inside, not the outside. A fact that escaped the notice of the constables, but which I observed upon visiting the scene.”\n\nI was astonished. “But that would imply that the thief was already inside the house.”\n\n“Precisely. And that narrows our list of suspects considerably. It suggests an insider, someone with intimate knowledge of the household.”\n\nHolmes rose and began to pace the room, his fingers steepled beneath his chin. “Moreover, the ruby itself was not taken for its value alone. There is a message hidden within its setting, a cipher that only a select few could decipher.”\n\nI frowned. “A cipher? What sort of message?”\n\n“That, Watson, is what we must discover. The ruby is a key, not merely a jewel.”\n\nHe paused and looked at me with a gleam in his eye. “Come, we must visit the estate once more. There are clues yet to be uncovered.”\n\nThe following day, we arrived at the grand estate of Lady Margaret, the owner of the missing ruby. The household was abuzz with gossip and speculation, but Holmes paid little heed to the chatter.\n\nHe examined the study where the ruby had been kept, noting the arrangement of books and papers. “See here, Watson,” he said, pointing to a series of scratches on the wooden desk. “These marks are not accidental. They form a pattern, a code.”\n\nI leaned closer, trying to decipher the strange symbols.\n\nHolmes continued, “I believe the ruby was a signal, a means to communicate with someone outside the household. Perhaps a lover, or a conspirator.”\n\nJust then, a young maid entered the room, her face pale and eyes wide with fear.\n\n“Miss Emily,” Holmes said gently, “do you know anything about the ruby’s disappearance?”\n\nShe hesitated, then nodded. “I saw Master James near the study late last night. He seemed agitated.”\n\n“Master James?” I inquired.\n\n“The son of Lady Margaret,” she replied. “He has been acting strangely of late.”\n\nHolmes nodded thoughtfully. “We must speak with him.”\n\nWe found James in the garden, pacing nervously. Holmes approached him with his usual calm demeanor.\n\n“James, I understand you were near the study last night. Can you tell me what you were doing?”\n\nJames swallowed hard. “I was looking for the ruby. I needed to see it one last time before... before I left.”\n\n“Left? Where to?”\n\n“To London. I have debts to settle, and I thought the ruby might help.”\n\nHolmes’s eyes narrowed. “Did you take it?”\n\n“No! I swear it. But I know who did.”\n\n“Who?”\n\nJames looked around nervously. “It was the butler, Mr. Collins. He’s been acting strange, and I caught him near the study.”\n\nHolmes exchanged a glance with me. “We must speak with Mr. Collins.”\n\nThe butler was a stern man, his face impassive. When questioned, he denied any involvement.\n\nHolmes, however, was not convinced. He searched the butler’s quarters and found a small, hidden compartment containing a letter.\n\nThe letter was addressed to a mysterious figure, discussing plans to sell the ruby and flee the country.\n\n“Ah, the plot thickens,” Holmes murmured.\n\nWe confronted Mr. Collins with the evidence. Faced with the truth, he confessed to the theft, motivated by greed and desperation.\n\nThe ruby was recovered, and Lady Margaret expressed her gratitude.\n\nAs we left the estate, Holmes turned to me. “Once again, Watson, it is the little things that reveal the truth. The scratches, the broken glass, the maid’s testimony—all pieces of a puzzle.”\n\nI nodded, marveling at his deductive prowess.\n\n“Come, Watson,” he said with a smile. “There are always more mysteries to solve.”"

          "text_segment": "I had been delayed at a case, and it was a little after half-past six when I found myself in Baker Street once more. As I approached the house I saw a tall man in a Scotch bonnet with a coat which was buttoned up to his chin waiting outside in the bright semicircle which was thrown from the fanlight. Just as I arrived the door was opened, and we were shown up together to Holmes’ room.\n“Mr. Henry Baker, I believe,” said he, rising from his armchair and greeting his visitor with the easy air of geniality which he could so readily assume. “Pray take this chair by the fire, Mr. Baker. It is a cold night, and I observe that your circulation is more adapted for summer than for winter. Ah, Watson, you have just come at the right time. Is that your hat, Mr. Baker?”\n“Yes, sir, that is undoubtedly my hat.”\nHe was a large man with rounded shoulders, a massive head, and a broad, intelligent face, sloping down to a pointed beard of grizzled brown. A touch of red in nose and cheeks, with a slight tremor of his extended hand, recalled Holmes’ surmise as to his habits. His rusty black frock-coat was buttoned right up in front, with the collar turned up, and his lank wrists protruded from his sleeves without a sign of cuff or shirt. He spoke in a slow staccato fashion, choosing his words with care, and gave the impression generally of a man of learning and letters who had had ill-usage at the hands of fortune.\n“We have retained these things for some days,” said Holmes, “because we expected to see an advertisement from you giving your address. I am at a loss to know now why you did not advertise.”\nOur visitor gave a rather shamefaced laugh. “Shillings have not been so plentiful with me as they once were,” he remarked. “I had no doubt that the gang of roughs who assaulted me had carried off both my hat and the bird. I did not care to spend more money in a hopeless attempt at recovering them.”\n“Very naturally. By the way, about the bird, we were compelled to eat it.”\n“To eat it!” Our visitor half rose from his chair in his excitement.\n“Yes, it would have been of no use to anyone had we not done so. But I presume that this other goose upon the sideboard, which is about the same weight and perfectly fresh, will answer your purpose equally well?”\n“Oh, certainly, certainly,” answered Mr. Baker with a sigh of relief.\n“Of course, we still have the feathers, legs, crop, and so on of your own bird, so if you wish—”\nThe man burst into a hearty laugh. “They might be useful to me as relics of my adventure,” said he, “but beyond that I can hardly see what use the disjecta membra of my late acquaintance are going to be to me. No, sir, I think that, with your permission, I will confine my attentions to the excellent bird which I perceive upon the sideboard.”\nSherlock Holmes glanced sharply across at me with a slight shrug of his shoulders.\n“There is your hat, then, and there your bird,” said he. “By the way, would it bore you to tell me where you got the other one from? I am somewhat of a fowl fancier, and I have seldom seen a better grown goose.”\n“Certainly, sir,” said Baker, who had risen and tucked his newly gained property under his arm. “There are a few of us who frequent the Alpha Inn, near the Museum—we are to be found in the Museum itself during the day, you understand. This year our good host, Windigate by name, instituted a goose club, by which, on consideration of some few pence every week, we were each to receive a bird at Christmas. My pence were duly paid, and the rest is familiar to you. I am much indebted to you, sir, for a Scotch bonnet is fitted neither to my years nor my gravity.” With a comical pomposity of manner he bowed solemnly to both of us and strode off upon his way.\n“So much for Mr. Henry Baker,” said Holmes when he had closed the door behind him. “It is quite certain that he knows nothing whatever about the matter. Are you hungry, Watson?”",

            "prefix-probing": "I had been delayed at a case, and it was a little after half-past six when I found myself in Baker Street once more. The fog lay thick upon the city, wrapping the gas lamps in a dim, yellow haze, and the familiar street seemed transformed into a shadowy labyrinth. As I ascended the stairs to our rooms at number 221B, I could hear the faint sound of a violin drifting through the door, a sure sign that Holmes was already at work.\n\nI opened the door quietly and found him seated in his armchair, the bow of his violin moving gracefully across the strings. His keen eyes were fixed upon a small pile of papers on the table before him, and his face bore the expression of intense concentration that I had come to associate with his moments of greatest insight.\n\n\"Ah, Watson,\" he said without looking up. \"You are just in time. I have been pondering a most curious case, one that has all the elements of a classic mystery, yet defies easy explanation.\"\n\nI set down my hat and coat and took my seat opposite him. \"Pray, do tell me more,\" I said eagerly.\n\nHolmes laid aside his violin and began to recount the details. \"A young woman, Miss Violet Hunter, came to me this afternoon with a tale that is as perplexing as it is alarming. She is a governess, recently employed at a country estate called Birlstone Manor, where she has encountered a series of strange occurrences that have left her both frightened and bewildered.\"\n\n\"Strange occurrences?\" I inquired.\n\n\"Indeed. Miss Hunter described a mysterious figure who appears at night, a man dressed in black who seems to be watching her. There have been unexplained noises, and a sense of menace that pervades the house. Her employer, Mr. Robert Ferguson, is a man of stern demeanor, and the household staff are tight-lipped and evasive.\"\n\nHolmes leaned forward, his eyes gleaming. \"The case has all the hallmarks of a secret, perhaps a crime concealed beneath layers of deception. Miss Hunter's courage in seeking assistance is commendable, and I have promised to accompany her to Birlstone Manor to investigate firsthand.\"\n\nI nodded, intrigued by the prospect of a new adventure. \"When do we depart?\"\n\n\"At dawn,\" Holmes replied. \"We must be prepared for whatever awaits us in the shadows of that ancient house.\"\n\nThe following morning, we set out for Birlstone Manor, a grand but somewhat gloomy estate nestled amidst rolling hills and dense woods. The journey was uneventful, but the atmosphere grew heavier as we approached the manor, the sky overcast and the air thick with anticipation.\n\nMiss Hunter greeted us at the door, her face pale but resolute. She led us through the dimly lit corridors, pointing out the rooms where the strange events had occurred. As we listened to her account, I could not help but feel a chill, as though unseen eyes were watching our every move.\n\nThat night, we took up our quarters in the manor, determined to uncover the truth. Holmes set about examining the premises with his usual meticulousness, noting every detail, no matter how insignificant it might seem. I kept vigil by the window, scanning the grounds for any sign of the mysterious figure.\n\nHours passed in silence, broken only by the occasional creak of the old house settling. Suddenly, a shadow flitted across the garden, and I alerted Holmes. He sprang to his feet, and together we followed the figure into the darkness.\n\nOur pursuit led us to a hidden passage beneath the manor, a secret corridor that had been concealed for years. Within its depths, we discovered evidence of a long-forgotten crime, a tale of betrayal and vengeance that had cast a pall over the estate.\n\nWith Holmes's keen intellect and unwavering determination, we unraveled the mystery, bringing justice to those who had suffered in silence. Miss Hunter was freed from her fears, and the shadows that had haunted Birlstone Manor were dispelled.\n\nAs we returned to London, I reflected on the case and the remarkable mind of my friend. Holmes had once again demonstrated that beneath the surface of the ordinary lies a world of intrigue and adventure, waiting to be revealed by those with the courage to seek the truth."

Our footfalls rang out crisply and loudly as we swung through the doctors’ quarter, Wimpole Street, Harley Street, and so through Wigmore Street into Oxford Street. In a quarter of an hour we were in Bloomsbury at the Alpha Inn, which is a small public-house at the corner of one of the streets which runs down into Holborn. Holmes pushed open the door of the private bar and ordered two glasses of beer from the ruddy-faced, white-aproned landlord.\n“Your beer should be excellent if it is as good as your geese,” said he.\n“My geese!” The man seemed surprised.\n“Yes. I was speaking only half an hour ago to Mr. Henry Baker, who was a member of your goose club.”\n“Ah! yes, I see. But you see, sir, them’s not our geese.”\n“Indeed! Whose, then?”\n“Well, I got the two dozen from a salesman in Covent Garden.”\n“Indeed? I know some of them. Which was it?”\n“Breckinridge is his name.”\n“Ah! I don’t know him. Well, here’s your good health landlord, and prosperity to your house. Good-night.”\n“Now for Mr. Breckinridge,” he continued, buttoning up his coat as we came out into the frosty air. “Remember, Watson that though we have so homely a thing as a goose at one end of this chain, we have at the other a man who will certainly get seven years’ penal servitude unless we can establish his innocence. It is possible that our inquiry may but confirm his guilt; but, in any case, we have a line of investigation which has been missed by the police, and which a singular chance has placed in our hands. Let us follow it out to the bitter end. Faces to the south, then, and quick march!”",

            "prefix-probing": "“Not particularly.” Holmes shrugged. “But the matter is of some interest, and I thought you might like to hear it.”\n\nI settled myself in my chair and prepared to listen. Holmes began:\n\n“It was on a cold, foggy evening in London when I received a visit from a distressed young woman. She was Miss Violet Hunter, governess to the wealthy Mrs. Rucastle. Miss Hunter had come to me with a peculiar case that had troubled her deeply. She spoke of strange noises in the night, a mysterious figure lurking about the estate, and a sense of impending danger.”\n\nHolmes’s eyes gleamed as he recounted the details. “Miss Hunter was employed at Birlstone Manor, a gloomy and isolated mansion. The Rucastle family was known for their secretive nature and the peculiar behavior of the master, Mr. Rucastle. Miss Hunter had been warned to keep away from certain parts of the house, but her curiosity was piqued by the odd occurrences.”\n\nI leaned forward, intrigued. “What sort of odd occurrences?”\n\n“Footsteps in the corridor at midnight, a strange light in the tower room, and the sudden disappearance of a valuable heirloom,” Holmes replied. “Miss Hunter was convinced that something sinister was afoot, and she sought my assistance.”\n\nHolmes described his journey to Birlstone Manor, the careful observations he made, and the subtle clues he uncovered. “The key was the secret passage hidden behind the bookcase in the library. It led to the tower room, where the heirloom was concealed. Mr. Rucastle had been attempting to frighten Miss Hunter away to keep his illicit activities hidden.”\n\nI was captivated by the tale, the intricate web of deception, and Holmes’s brilliant deductions. “And the heirloom?” I asked.\n\nHolmes smiled. “Safely recovered and returned to its rightful owner. The mystery was solved, and justice prevailed.”\n\nI sighed with relief and admiration. “Truly, Holmes, your powers of observation and reasoning are unparalleled.”\n\nHe nodded modestly. “It is all in the details, Watson. The smallest clue can unravel the greatest mystery.”"

One of the largest stalls bore the name of Breckinridge upon it, and the proprietor a horsey-looking man, with a sharp face and trim side-whiskers was helping a boy to put up the shutters.\n“Good-evening. It’s a cold night,” said Holmes.\nThe salesman nodded and shot a questioning glance at my companion.\n“Sold out of geese, I see,” continued Holmes, pointing at the bare slabs of marble.\n“Let you have five hundred to-morrow morning.”\n“That’s no good.”\n“Well, there are some on the stall with the gas-flare.”\n“Ah, but I was recommended to you.”\n“Who by?”\n“The landlord of the Alpha.”\n“Oh, yes; I sent him a couple of dozen.”\n“Fine birds they were, too. Now where did you get them from?”\nTo my surprise the question provoked a burst of anger from the salesman.\n“Now, then, mister,” said he, with his head cocked and his arms akimbo, “what are you driving at? Let’s have it straight, now.”\n“It is straight enough. I should like to know who sold you the geese which you supplied to the Alpha.”\n“Well then, I shan’t tell you. So now!”\n“Oh, it is a matter of no importance; but I don’t know why you should be so warm over such a trifle.”\n“Warm! You’d be as warm, maybe, if you were as pestered as I am. When I pay good money for a good article there should be an end of the business; but it’s ‘Where are the geese?’ and ‘Who did you sell the geese to?’ and ‘What will you take for the geese?’ One would think they were the only geese in the world, to hear the fuss that is made over them.”\n“Well, I have no connection with any other people who have been making inquiries,” said Holmes carelessly. “If you won’t tell us the bet is off, that is all. But I’m always ready to back my opinion on a matter of fowls, and I have a fiver on it that the bird I ate is country bred.”\n“Well, then, you’ve lost your fiver, for it’s town bred,” snapped the salesman.\n“It’s nothing of the kind.”\n“I say it is.”\n“I don’t believe it.”\n“D’you think you know more about fowls than I, who have handled them ever since I was a nipper? I tell you, all those birds that went to the Alpha were town bred.”\n“You’ll never persuade me to believe that.”\n“Will you bet, then?”\n“It’s merely taking your money, for I know that I am right. But I’ll have a sovereign on with you, just to teach you not to be obstinate.”\nThe salesman chuckled grimly. “Bring me the books, Bill,” said he.\nThe small boy brought round a small thin volume and a great greasy-backed one, laying them out together beneath the hanging lamp.\n“Now then, Mr. Cocksure,” said the salesman, “I thought that I was out of geese, but before I finish you’ll find that there is still one left in my shop. You see this little book?”\n“Well?”\n“That’s the list of the folk from whom I buy. D’you see? Well, then, here on this page are the country folk, and the numbers after their names are where their accounts are in the big ledger. Now, then! You see this other page in red ink? Well, that is a list of my town suppliers. Now, look at that third name. Just read it out to me.”\n“Mrs. Oakshott, 117, Brixton Road—249,” read Holmes.\n“Quite so. Now turn that up in the ledger.”\nHolmes turned to the page indicated. “Here you are, ‘Mrs. Oakshott, 117, Brixton Road, egg and poultry supplier.’”\n“Now, then, what’s the last entry?”\n“‘December 22nd. Twenty-four geese at 7s. 6d.’”\n“Quite so. There you are. And underneath?”\n“‘Sold to Mr. Windigate of the Alpha, at 12s.’”\n“What have you to say now?”\nSherlock Holmes looked deeply chagrined. He drew a sovereign from his pocket and threw it down upon the slab, turning away with the air of a man whose disgust is too deep for words. A few yards off he stopped under a lamp-post and laughed in the hearty, noiseless fashion which was peculiar to him.\n“When you see a man with whiskers of that cut and the ‘Pink ’un’ protruding out of his pocket, you can always draw him by a bet,” said he. “I daresay that if I had put £ 100 down in front of him, that man would not have given me such complete information as was drawn from him by the idea that he was doing me on a wager. Well, Watson, we are, I fancy, nearing the end of our quest, and the only point which remains to be determined is whether we should go on to this Mrs. Oakshott to-night, or whether we should reserve it for to-morrow. It is clear from what that surly fellow said that there are others besides ourselves who are anxious about the matter, and I should—”",

Holmes accosted him with a friendly remark. \"A very cold night, Mr. Breckinridge,\" said he. \"I suppose you have sold all your geese?\" \"Yes, sir,\" said the man, \"all gone. But I shall have some more in the morning if you want to buy.\" \"I was recommended to you by the landlord of the Alpha,\" said Holmes. \"He told me you supplied him with geese.\" \"Yes, sir,\" said Breckinridge. \"I send him geese regularly.\" \"And where do you get those geese from?\" asked Holmes. The man’s face darkened, and he looked at Holmes with a frown. \"What do you want to know that for?\" he said. \"I don’t like being pestered with questions about my geese.\" \"I am not asking for nothing,\" said Holmes. \"I will make a bet with you.

            "prefix-probing": "We passed across Holborn, down Endell Street, and so through a zigzag of slums to Covent Garden Market. The air was heavy with the mingled scents of fresh fruit, fish, and the less savory odors of the back alleys. The market was a bustling hive of activity, with vendors shouting their wares and buyers haggling over prices. Holmes moved with a purpose, his keen eyes scanning every face and every shadow as if searching for a hidden clue.\n\n\"Observe, Watson,\" he whispered, \"the way the crowd parts as we approach that stall. There is a man there who does not belong to this place.\"\n\nI followed his gaze to a tall, thin figure clad in a dark overcoat, his face partially obscured by the brim of a hat. He seemed out of place among the rough market folk, his movements too deliberate, his eyes too watchful.\n\nHolmes quickened his pace, weaving through the throng until he was close enough to speak. \"Good day, sir,\" he said smoothly. \"Might I inquire if you have seen a man answering to the description of Mr. John Clay?\"\n\nThe stranger's eyes flickered with a momentary flash of recognition, but he quickly masked it with a polite smile. \"I'm afraid I cannot help you, sir,\" he replied, his voice calm but guarded.\n\nHolmes nodded, but his gaze remained fixed on the man. \"Very well. If you should come across such a person, I would be grateful if you would inform me at once.\"\n\nThe man inclined his head and melted back into the crowd. Holmes turned to me with a grim expression. \"That was no ordinary passerby, Watson. I suspect he is connected to the recent string of burglaries that have plagued the city.\"\n\nWe continued our journey through the market, Holmes occasionally stopping to question vendors and gather information. Each piece of intelligence seemed to weave together into a tapestry of intrigue and danger.\n\nAs the sun began to dip below the horizon, casting long shadows across the cobblestones, we found ourselves at the entrance to a narrow alleyway. Holmes paused, his eyes narrowing as he listened intently.\n\n\"Do you hear that, Watson? The faint sound of footsteps and whispered voices. We are close.\"\n\nWe crept forward, the noise growing louder with each step. Suddenly, a figure emerged from the darkness, clutching a small leather pouch. He glanced around nervously before slipping into a side door.\n\nHolmes motioned for me to follow, and we slipped inside after him. The room was dimly lit, filled with the murmur of conspiratorial voices. Around a table sat several men, their faces obscured by shadows.\n\n\"Gentlemen,\" Holmes announced, stepping into the light, \"I believe you have some explaining to do.\"\n\nThe men sprang to their feet, reaching for weapons, but Holmes was quicker. With a swift movement, he produced a revolver and commanded, \"Stay where you are.\"\n\nOne of the men, a burly fellow with a scar across his cheek, sneered. \"You have no proof, detective.\"\n\nHolmes smiled coldly. \"On the contrary, I have all the proof I need. The stolen jewels found in your possession, the eyewitness accounts, and the testimony of a certain Mr. John Clay, who is none other than your leader.\"\n\nThe room erupted into chaos, but before the men could react, the sound of police sirens filled the air. Reinforcements had arrived, and the criminals were swiftly apprehended.\n\nAs the men were led away in handcuffs, Holmes turned to me with a satisfied grin. \"Another case closed, Watson. The city is a little safer tonight.\"\n\nI nodded, marveling once again at my companion's unparalleled skill and dedication. Together, we had unraveled the mystery that had confounded so many, bringing justice to those who sought to undermine it."

Turning round we saw a little rat-faced fellow standing in the centre of the circle of yellow light which was thrown by the swinging lamp, while Breckinridge, the salesman, framed in the door of his stall, was shaking his fists fiercely at the cringing figure.\n“I’ve had enough of you and your geese,” he shouted. “I wish you were all at the devil together. If you come pestering me any more with your silly talk I’ll set the dog at you. You bring Mrs. Oakshott here and I’ll answer her, but what have you to do with it? Did I buy the geese off you?”\n“No; but one of them was mine all the same,” whined the little man.\n“Well, then, ask Mrs. Oakshott for it.”\n“She told me to ask you.”\n“Well, you can ask the King of Proosia, for all I care. I’ve had enough of it. Get out of this!” He rushed fiercely forward, and the inquirer flitted away into the darkness.\n“Ha! this may save us a visit to Brixton Road,” whispered Holmes. “Come with me, and we will see what is to be made of this fellow.” Striding through the scattered knots of people who lounged round the flaring stalls, my companion speedily overtook the little man and touched him upon the shoulder. He sprang round, and I could see in the gas-light that every vestige of colour had been driven from his face.\n“Who are you, then? What do you want?” he asked in a quavering voice.\n“You will excuse me,” said Holmes blandly, “but I could not help overhearing the questions which you put to the salesman just now. I think that I could be of assistance to you.”\n“You? Who are you? How could you know anything of the matter?”\n“My name is Sherlock Holmes. It is my business to know what other people don’t know.”\n“But you can know nothing of this?”\n“Excuse me, I know everything of it. You are endeavouring to trace some geese which were sold by Mrs. Oakshott, of Brixton Road, to a salesman named Breckinridge, by him in turn to Mr. Windigate, of the Alpha, and by him to his club, of which Mr. Henry Baker is a member.”\n“Oh, sir, you are the very man whom I have longed to meet,” cried the little fellow with outstretched hands and quivering fingers. “I can hardly explain to you how interested I am in this matter.”\nSherlock Holmes hailed a four-wheeler which was passing. “In that case we had better discuss it in a cosy room rather than in this wind-swept market-place,” said he. “But pray tell me, before we go farther, who it is that I have the pleasure of assisting.”\nThe man hesitated for an instant. “My name is John Robinson,” he answered with a sidelong glance.\n“No, no; the real name,” said Holmes sweetly. “It is always awkward doing business with an alias.”\nA flush sprang to the white cheeks of the stranger. “Well then,” said he, “my real name is James Ryder.”\n“Precisely so. Head attendant at the Hotel Cosmopolitan. Pray step into the cab, and I shall soon be able to tell you everything which you would wish to know.”\nThe little man stood glancing from one to the other of us with half-frightened, half-hopeful eyes, as one who is not sure whether he is on the verge of a windfall or of a catastrophe. Then he stepped into the cab, and in half an hour we were back in the sitting-room at Baker Street. Nothing had been said during our drive, but the high, thin breathing of our new companion, and the claspings and unclaspings of his hands, spoke of the nervous tension within him.",

            "prefix-probing": "His remarks were suddenly cut short by a loud hubbub which broke out from the stall which we had just left. Turning quickly, we saw a crowd gathering, their faces animated with excitement and curiosity. Holmes, ever alert, pushed his way through the throng, with me close behind. At the center of the commotion stood a man, his clothes disheveled and his expression one of distress. In his hand, he clutched a small, ornate box, which he held out as if to show its contents to the onlookers.\n\n\"What is the matter here?\" Holmes inquired, his keen eyes scanning the scene.\n\n\"It's this box, sir,\" the man replied, his voice trembling. \"It was stolen from my shop just this morning, and I have just recovered it. But inside, something is missing, and I fear foul play.\"\n\nHolmes took the box and examined it carefully. The craftsmanship was exquisite, the wood polished to a fine sheen, and the lock intricate. He noted the faint scratches around the edges, signs of forced entry. \"May I see the contents?\" he asked.\n\nThe man nodded and opened the box to reveal a velvet-lined interior, now empty save for a few scattered crumbs. \"My most prized possession, a ruby of great value, was kept here,\" he explained. \"It is gone.\"\n\nHolmes's eyes narrowed. \"Tell me, sir, where were you when the theft occurred?\"\n\n\"I was attending to customers at the front of the shop,\" the man replied. \"The box was in the back room, locked away.\"\n\n\"And who else had access to the premises?\"\n\n\"Only my assistant, a young lad named James.\"\n\nHolmes nodded thoughtfully. \"I shall need to speak with this James.\"\n\nThe crowd began to disperse as the excitement waned, and Holmes motioned for me to follow him. We made our way to the address the man provided, a modest shop not far from the market. Inside, a boy of about sixteen greeted us nervously.\n\n\"Are you James?\" Holmes asked.\n\nThe boy nodded, eyes downcast. \"Yes, sir.\"\n\n\"Did you have access to the back room this morning?\"\n\n\"Yes, sir. I was asked to fetch some supplies.\"\n\n\"Did you notice anything unusual?\"\n\nJames hesitated. \"Well, sir, I did see a man loitering near the back door. He seemed out of place.\"\n\nHolmes's interest was piqued. \"Can you describe him?\"\n\n\"He was tall, with a dark coat and a hat pulled low over his face.\"\n\n\"Did you speak to him?\"\n\n\"No, sir. I was too frightened.\"\n\nHolmes turned to me. \"Watson, it seems we have a lead. We must investigate this stranger.\"\n\nWe left the shop and began canvassing the neighborhood, asking if anyone had seen such a man. After some inquiries, we learned that a man matching the description had been seen near the docks earlier that day. Holmes and I made our way there, the bustling activity of the port providing ample cover for clandestine dealings.\n\nAs we approached a dimly lit tavern frequented by sailors and dockworkers, Holmes signaled for silence. We entered quietly, scanning the room. In a shadowed corner sat a man matching the description, nursing a drink and watching the door.\n\nHolmes approached him calmly. \"Good evening, sir. Might I have a word?\"\n\nThe man looked up, startled, then quickly composed himself. \"What do you want?\"\n\n\"I am investigating a theft of a valuable ruby. I believe you may have information.\"\n\nThe man's eyes flickered with fear. \"I don't know anything about that.\"\n\nHolmes smiled thinly. \"Perhaps not. But I have reason to believe otherwise.\"\n\nSuddenly, the man bolted for the door. Holmes was quick to pursue, with me close behind. The chase led us through narrow alleys and over fences, until finally, the man stumbled and fell. Holmes was upon him in an instant, retrieving a small pouch from his pocket.\n\n\"Is this what I think it is?\" Holmes asked, opening the pouch to reveal the missing ruby.\n\nThe man hung his head in defeat. \"Yes. I took it, but I swear I was forced.\"\n\nHolmes regarded him thoughtfully. \"Who compelled you?\"\n\nThe man hesitated, then whispered a name. \"A man known as Blackwood.\"\n\nHolmes nodded. \"We shall see about that.\"\n\nWith the ruby safely recovered, we returned it to its rightful owner, who expressed his gratitude profusely. As we walked away, Holmes turned to me. \"Another case closed, Watson. Yet, I suspect this Blackwood is a man we shall hear of again.\"\n\nI could only agree, marveling once more at Holmes's unerring instinct and relentless pursuit of justice."

I will just put on my slippers before we settle this little matter of yours. Now, then! You want to know what became of those geese?”\n“Yes, sir.”\n“Or rather, I fancy, of that goose. It was one bird, I imagine in which you were interested—white, with a black bar across the tail.”\nRyder quivered with emotion. “Oh, sir,” he cried, “can you tell me where it went to?”\n“It came here.”\n“Here?”\n“Yes, and a most remarkable bird it proved. I don’t wonder that you should take an interest in it. It laid an egg after it was dead—the bonniest, brightest little blue egg that ever was seen. I have it here in my museum.”\nOur visitor staggered to his feet and clutched the mantelpiece with his right hand. Holmes unlocked his strong-box and held up the blue carbuncle, which shone out like a star, with a cold, brilliant, many-pointed radiance. Ryder stood glaring with a drawn face, uncertain whether to claim or to disown it.\n“The game’s up, Ryder,” said Holmes quietly. “Hold up, man, or you’ll be into the fire! Give him an arm back into his chair, Watson. He’s not got blood enough to go in for felony with impunity. Give him a dash of brandy. So! Now he looks a little more human. What a shrimp it is, to be sure!”\nFor a moment he had staggered and nearly fallen, but the brandy brought a tinge of colour into his cheeks, and he sat staring with frightened eyes at his accuser.\n“I have almost every link in my hands, and all the proofs which I could possibly need, so there is little which you need tell me. Still, that little may as well be cleared up to make the case complete. You had heard, Ryder, of this blue stone of the Countess of Morcar’s?”\n“It was Catherine Cusack who told me of it,” said he in a crackling voice.\n“I see—her ladyship’s waiting-maid. Well, the temptation of sudden wealth so easily acquired was too much for you, as it has been for better men before you; but you were not very scrupulous in the means you used. It seems to me, Ryder, that there is the making of a very pretty villain in you. You knew that this man Horner, the plumber, had been concerned in some such matter before, and that suspicion would rest the more readily upon him. What did you do, then? You made some small job in my lady’s room—you and your confederate Cusack—and you managed that he should be the man sent for. Then, when he had left, you rifled the jewel-case, raised the alarm, and had this unfortunate man arrested. You then—”\nRyder threw himself down suddenly upon the rug and clutched at my companion’s knees. “For God’s sake, have mercy!” he shrieked. “Think of my father! Of my mother! It would break their hearts. I never went wrong before! I never will again. I swear it. I’ll swear it on a Bible. Oh, don’t bring it into court! For Christ’s sake, don’t!”\n“Get back into your chair!” said Holmes sternly. “It is very well to cringe and crawl now, but you thought little enough of this poor Horner in the dock for a crime of which he knew nothing.”\n“I will fly, Mr. Holmes. I will leave the country, sir. Then the charge against him will break down.”\n“Hum! We will talk about that. And now let us hear a true account of the next act. How came the stone into the goose, and how came the goose into the open market? Tell us the truth, for there lies your only hope of safety.”\nRyder passed his tongue over his parched lips. “I will tell you it just as it happened, sir,” said he. “When Horner had been arrested, it seemed to me that it would be best for me to get away with the stone at once, for I did not know at what moment the police might not take it into their heads to search me and my room. There was no place about the hotel where it would be safe. I went out, as if on some commission, and I made for my sister’s house. She had married a man named Oakshott, and lived in Brixton Road, where she fattened fowls for the market. All the way there every man I met seemed to me to be a policeman or a detective; and, for all that it was a cold night, the sweat was pouring down my face before I came to the Brixton Road. My sister asked me what was the matter, and why I was so pale; but I told her that I had been upset by the jewel robbery at the hotel. Then I went into the back yard and smoked a pipe and wondered what it would be best to do.\n“I had a friend once called Maudsley, who went to the bad, and has just been serving his time in Pentonville. One day he had met me, and fell into talk about the ways of thieves, and how they could get rid of what they stole. I knew that he would be true to me, for I knew one or two things about him; so I made up my mind to go right on to Kilburn, where he lived, and take him into my confidence. He would show me how to turn the stone into money. But how to get to him in safety? I thought of the agonies I had gone through in coming from the hotel. I might at any moment be seized and searched, and there would be the stone in my waistcoat pocket. I was leaning against the wall at the time and looking at the geese which were waddling about round my feet, and suddenly an idea came into my head which showed me how I could beat the best detective that ever lived.\n“My sister had told me some weeks before that I might have the pick of her geese for a Christmas present, and I knew that she was always as good as her word. I would take my goose now, and in it I would carry my stone to Kilburn. There was a little shed in the yard, and behind this I drove one of the birds—a fine big one, white, with a barred tail. I caught it, and prying its bill open, I thrust the stone down its throat as far as my finger could reach. The bird gave a gulp, and I felt the stone pass along its gullet and down into its crop. But the creature flapped and struggled, and out came my sister to know what was the matter. As I turned to speak to her the brute broke loose and fluttered off among the others.\n“‘Whatever were you doing with that bird, Jem?’ says she.\n“‘Well,’ said I, ‘you said you’d give me one for Christmas, and I was feeling which was the fattest.’\n“‘Oh,’ says she, ‘we’ve set yours aside for you—Jem’s bird, we call it. It’s the big white one over yonder. There’s twenty-six of them, which makes one for you, and one for us, and two dozen for the market.’\n“‘Thank you, Maggie,’ says I; ‘but if it is all the same to you, I’d rather have that one I was handling just now.’\n“‘The other is a good three pound heavier,’ said she, ‘and we fattened it expressly for you.’\n“‘Never mind. I’ll have the other, and I’ll take it now,’ said I.\n“‘Oh, just as you like,’ said she, a little huffed. ‘Which is it you want, then?’\n“‘That white one with the barred tail, right in the middle of the flock.’\n“‘Oh, very well. Kill it and take it with you.’\n“Well, I did what she said, Mr. Holmes, and I carried the bird all the way to Kilburn. I told my pal what I had done, for he was a man that it was easy to tell a thing like that to. He laughed until he choked, and we got a knife and opened the goose. My heart turned to water, for there was no sign of the stone, and I knew that some terrible mistake had occurred. I left the bird, rushed back to my sister’s, and hurried into the back yard. There was not a bird to be seen there.\n“‘Where are they all, Maggie?’ I cried.\n“‘Gone to the dealer’s, Jem.’\n“‘Which dealer’s?’\n“‘Breckinridge, of Covent Garden.’\n“‘But was there another with a barred tail?’ I asked, ‘the same as the one I chose?’\n“‘Yes, Jem; there were two barred-tailed ones, and I could never tell them apart.’\n“Well, then, of course I saw it all, and I ran off as hard as my feet would carry me to this man Breckinridge; but he had sold the lot at once, and not one word would he tell me as to where they had gone. You heard him yourselves to-night. Well, he has always answered me like that. My sister thinks that I am going mad. Sometimes I think that I am myself. And now—and now I am myself a branded thief, without ever having touched the wealth for which I sold my character. God help me! God help me!” He burst into convulsive sobbing, with his face buried in his hands.",

            "prefix-probing": "“Here we are!” said Holmes cheerily as we filed into the room. The fire was burning brightly in the grate, casting flickering shadows upon the walls, and the air was thick with the scent of tobacco and old books. Holmes took off his coat and settled into the armchair by the hearth, his keen eyes already scanning the room for any sign of the mystery that awaited us.\n\nI, Dr. Watson, followed suit, placing my medical bag on the table and seating myself opposite him. The case that had brought us here was one of the most perplexing I had yet encountered in our adventures together. A series of strange occurrences had been reported at the estate of Lord Blackwood, a man known for his reclusive nature and vast collection of rare artifacts.\n\nHolmes leaned forward, steepling his fingers as he spoke. “The key to this puzzle lies not in the obvious, but in the subtle details. We must observe everything, no matter how insignificant it may seem.”\n\nJust then, a soft knock at the door announced the arrival of the housekeeper, Mrs. Hudson, who carried a tray with tea and biscuits. She placed it on the table and gave us a knowing smile before retreating quietly.\n\nAs we sipped our tea, Holmes began to outline the facts of the case. Lord Blackwood had reported that several valuable items had gone missing from his collection, yet there were no signs of forced entry or disturbance. Moreover, the servants had heard strange noises at night, and some claimed to have seen ghostly figures wandering the halls.\n\n“Ghosts, you say?” I remarked, raising an eyebrow.\n\nHolmes smiled faintly. “The supernatural is often a convenient explanation for the inexplicable. Our task is to uncover the truth behind these tales.”\n\nWe agreed to begin our investigation by examining the rooms where the incidents had occurred. The first was the library, a vast chamber lined with shelves of ancient tomes and curiosities. Holmes moved methodically, inspecting the shelves, the windows, and the floor for any clues.\n\n“Notice, Watson,” he said, pointing to a faint scratch on the wooden floor near the window. “This suggests that something was dragged here recently.”\n\nI nodded, noting the mark. “But what could it be?”\n\nHolmes pondered for a moment before turning to the window. “The latch is intact, and the glass unbroken. Entry through this point seems unlikely.”\n\nNext, we proceeded to the gallery, where several paintings had been reported missing. The walls bore empty frames, and the dust on the floor was undisturbed.\n\n“Curious,” Holmes mused. “No sign of forced removal, yet the paintings are gone.”\n\nAs we continued our search, Holmes’s attention was drawn to a small, ornate box on a side table. He opened it carefully, revealing a collection of old keys.\n\n“Keys, Watson,” he said. “Perhaps these will unlock some secrets.”\n\nWe spent the remainder of the afternoon interviewing the household staff, each of whom provided their own version of events. Some were frightened, others suspicious, but all were eager to assist.\n\nThat evening, as the house settled into silence, Holmes and I sat by the fire, reviewing our notes.\n\n“Tomorrow, we shall set a trap,” Holmes declared. “The thief will reveal himself when he believes the coast is clear.”\n\nI admired Holmes’s confidence, though I remained cautious. The night passed uneventfully, but as dawn broke, a sudden noise roused us from our rest.\n\nHolmes sprang from his chair, motioning for silence. We crept towards the source of the sound, a faint rustling from the gallery.\n\nThere, in the dim light, we caught sight of a shadowy figure attempting to remove a painting from its frame.\n\n“Stop!” Holmes commanded, stepping forward.\n\nThe figure froze, then turned to face us, revealing the face of the butler, a man whose loyalty had never been in question.\n\n“I had no choice,” he confessed. “I was desperate.”\n\nHolmes nodded thoughtfully. “Desperation often leads to folly. Let us hear your story.”\n\nThe butler explained that he had been coerced by a criminal gang seeking the valuable artifacts. He had hoped to protect the household by cooperating, but the burden had become too great.\n\nWith the mystery resolved, Lord Blackwood expressed his gratitude, and peace returned to the estate.\n\nAs Holmes and I departed, I reflected on the case, reminded once again of the power of observation and deduction in unraveling even the most baffling enigmas."

Of all these varied cases, however, I cannot recall any which presented more singular features than that which was associated with the well-known Surrey family of the Roylotts of Stoke Moran. The events in question occurred in the early days of my association with Holmes, when we were sharing rooms as bachelors in Baker Street. It is possible that I might have placed them upon record before, but a promise of secrecy was made at the time, from which I have only been freed during the last month by the untimely death of the lady to whom the pledge was given. It is perhaps as well that the facts should now come to light, for I have reasons to know that there are widespread rumours as to the death of Dr. Grimesby Roylott which tend to make the matter even more terrible than the truth.\nIt was early in April in the year ’83 that I woke one morning to find Sherlock Holmes standing, fully dressed, by the side of my bed. He was a late riser, as a rule, and as the clock on the mantelpiece showed me that it was only a quarter-past seven, I blinked up at him in some surprise, and perhaps just a little resentment, for I was myself regular in my habits.\n“Very sorry to knock you up, Watson,” said he, “but it’s the common lot this morning. Mrs. Hudson has been knocked up, she retorted upon me, and I on you.”\n“What is it, then—a fire?”\n“No; a client. It seems that a young lady has arrived in a considerable state of excitement, who insists upon seeing me. She is waiting now in the sitting-room. Now, when young ladies wander about the metropolis at this hour of the morning, and knock sleepy people up out of their beds, I presume that it is something very pressing which they have to communicate. Should it prove to be an interesting case, you would, I am sure, wish to follow it from the outset. I thought, at any rate, that I should call you and give you the chance.”\n“My dear fellow, I would not miss it for anything.”\nI had no keener pleasure than in following Holmes in his professional investigations, and in admiring the rapid deductions, as swift as intuitions, and yet always founded on a logical basis with which he unravelled the problems which were submitted to him. I rapidly threw on my clothes and was ready in a few minutes to accompany my friend down to the sitting-room. A lady dressed in black and heavily veiled, who had been sitting in the window, rose as we entered.\n“Good-morning, madam,” said Holmes cheerily. “My name is Sherlock Holmes. This is my intimate friend and associate, Dr. Watson, before whom you can speak as freely as before myself. Ha! I am glad to see that Mrs. Hudson has had the good sense to light the fire. Pray draw up to it, and I shall order you a cup of hot coffee, for I observe that you are shivering.”\n“It is not cold which makes me shiver,” said the woman in a low voice, changing her seat as requested.\n“What, then?”\n“It is fear, Mr. Holmes. It is terror.” She raised her veil as she spoke, and we could see that she was indeed in a pitiable state of agitation, her face all drawn and grey, with restless frightened eyes, like those of some hunted animal. Her features and figure were those of a woman of thirty, but her hair was shot with premature grey, and her expression was weary and haggard. Sherlock Holmes ran her over with one of his quick, all-comprehensive glances.\n“You must not fear,” said he soothingly, bending forward and patting her forearm. “We shall soon set matters right, I have no doubt. You have come in by train this morning, I see.”\n“You know me, then?”\n“No, but I observe the second half of a return ticket in the palm of your left glove. You must have started early, and yet you had a good drive in a dog-cart, along heavy roads, before you reached the station.”\nThe lady gave a violent start and stared in bewilderment at my companion.\n“There is no mystery, my dear madam,” said he, smiling. “The left arm of your jacket is spattered with mud in no less than seven places. The marks are perfectly fresh.",

                "text": "On glancing over my notes of the seventy odd cases in which I have during the last eight years studied the methods of my friend Sherlock Holmes, I find many tragic, some comic, a large number merely strange, but none commonplace; for, working as he did rather for the love of his art than for the acquirement of wealth, he refused to associate himself with any investigation which did not tend towards the unusual, and even the fantastic. I recall one that was so strange and so painful, and yet which so clearly illustrated his wonderful powers of observation and deduction, that I am tempted to lay it before the public, especially as it was the first case which he undertook in which a woman came to him for aid.

            "prefix-probing": "He was, I take it, the most perfect reasoning and observing machine that the world has seen, but as a lover of his art, and as an earnest student of human nature, I found in him a sympathy and a depth of feeling which were rarely exhibited by men of his type. His methods were singularly effective, combining the most rigorous logic with an almost intuitive grasp of the human heart. \n\nOne of the earliest cases that I had the privilege to witness was that of the \"Speckled Band,\" a mystery that involved a sinister stepfather, a frightened young woman, and a deadly serpent. Holmes's keen eye noticed details that escaped the ordinary observer: the ventilator connecting two rooms, the peculiar whistle heard at night, and the presence of a saucer of milk. These clues, when pieced together, revealed a plot so diabolical that it chilled the blood. \n\nIn another instance, the \"Red-Headed League\" case, Holmes unraveled a curious scheme involving a bogus employment agency, a secret tunnel, and a gang of criminals intent on robbery. The absurdity of the premise—a league formed solely for red-headed men—masked a clever ruse, and only Holmes's persistence and insight brought the truth to light. \n\nThroughout these adventures, I observed that Holmes's success lay not merely in his intellect but in his unwavering dedication to justice and his profound understanding of human motives. He was not content with superficial explanations; he delved deep into the psychology of his subjects, often anticipating their actions before they themselves were aware of their intentions. \n\nHis methods were sometimes met with skepticism by the official police, who regarded his deductions as fanciful or unorthodox. Yet, time and again, Holmes's conclusions were vindicated by the facts, and his reputation grew accordingly. He was a man ahead of his time, employing forensic science, disguise, and meticulous observation long before these became standard practice. \n\nOne of the most remarkable aspects of Holmes's character was his humility. Despite his extraordinary talents, he never sought fame or fortune. His primary motivation was the intellectual challenge and the satisfaction of bringing wrongdoers to justice. This purity of purpose endeared him to those who knew him and made his successes all the more admirable. \n\nIn reflecting upon these cases, I am reminded of the profound impact that a single individual can have when armed with knowledge, determination, and a sense of moral duty. Holmes's legacy is not merely the resolution of mysteries but the demonstration of the power of reason and observation in a world often clouded by confusion and deceit. \n\nAs I continue to chronicle his exploits, I am ever more convinced that the art of detection is a noble pursuit, one that requires not only intellect but also empathy and courage. Sherlock Holmes exemplified these qualities, and it is my hope that these accounts will inspire others to follow in his footsteps, seeking truth and justice wherever they may be found."

Sir, I can stand this strain no longer; I shall go mad if it continues. I have no one to turn to—none, save only one, who cares for me, and he, poor fellow, can be of little aid. I have heard of you, Mr. Holmes; I have heard of you from Mrs. Farintosh, whom you helped in the hour of her sore need. It was from her that I had your address. Oh, sir, do you not think that you could help me, too, and at least throw a little light through the dense darkness which surrounds me? At present it is out of my power to reward you for your services, but in a month or six weeks I shall be married, with the control of my own income, and then at least you shall not find me ungrateful.”\nHolmes turned to his desk and, unlocking it, drew out a small case-book, which he consulted.\n“Farintosh,” said he. “Ah yes, I recall the case; it was concerned with an opal tiara. I think it was before your time, Watson. I can only say, madam, that I shall be happy to devote the same care to your case as I did to that of your friend. As to reward, my profession is its own reward; but you are at liberty to defray whatever expenses I may be put to, at the time which suits you best. And now I beg that you will lay before us everything that may help us in forming an opinion upon the matter.”\n“Alas!” replied our visitor, “the very horror of my situation lies in the fact that my fears are so vague, and my suspicions depend so entirely upon small points, which might seem trivial to another, that even he to whom of all others I have a right to look for help and advice looks upon all that I tell him about it as the fancies of a nervous woman. He does not say so, but I can read it from his soothing answers and averted eyes. But I have heard, Mr. Holmes, that you can see deeply into the manifold wickedness of the human heart. You may advise me how to walk amid the dangers which encompass me.”\n“I am all attention, madam.”\n“My name is Helen Stoner, and I am living with my stepfather, who is the last survivor of one of the oldest Saxon families in England, the Roylotts of Stoke Moran, on the western border of Surrey.”\nHolmes nodded his head. “The name is familiar to me,” said he.\n“The family was at one time among the richest in England, and the estates extended over the borders into Berkshire in the north, and Hampshire in the west. In the last century, however, four successive heirs were of a dissolute and wasteful disposition, and the family ruin was eventually completed by a gambler in the days of the Regency. Nothing was left save a few acres of ground, and the two-hundred-year-old house, which is itself crushed under a heavy mortgage. The last squire dragged out his existence there, living the horrible life of an aristocratic pauper; but his only son, my stepfather, seeing that he must adapt himself to the new conditions, obtained an advance from a relative, which enabled him to take a medical degree and went out to Calcutta, where, by his professional skill and his force of character, he established a large practice. In a fit of anger, however, caused by some robberies which had been perpetrated in the house, he beat his native butler to death and narrowly escaped a capital sentence. As it was, he suffered a long term of imprisonment and afterwards returned to England a morose and disappointed man.\n“When Dr. Roylott was in India he married my mother, Mrs. Stoner, the young widow of Major-General Stoner, of the Bengal Artillery. My sister Julia and I were twins, and we were only two years old at the time of my mother’s re-marriage. She had a considerable sum of money—not less than £ 1000 a year—and this she bequeathed to Dr. Roylott entirely while we resided with him, with a provision that a certain annual sum should be allowed to each of us in the event of our marriage. Shortly after our return to England my mother died—she was killed eight years ago in a railway accident near Crewe. Dr. Roylott then abandoned his attempts to establish himself in practice in London and took us to live with him in the old ancestral house at Stoke Moran. The money which my mother had left was enough for all our wants, and there seemed to be no obstacle to our happiness.\n“But a terrible change came over our stepfather about this time. Instead of making friends and exchanging visits with our neighbours, who had at first been overjoyed to see a Roylott of Stoke Moran back in the old family seat, he shut himself up in his house and seldom came out save to indulge in ferocious quarrels with whoever might cross his path. Violence of temper approaching to mania has been hereditary in the men of the family, and in my stepfather’s case it had, I believe, been intensified by his long residence in the tropics. A series of disgraceful brawls took place, two of which ended in the police-court, until at last he became the terror of the village, and the folks would fly at his approach, for he is a man of immense strength, and absolutely uncontrollable in his anger.\n“Last week he hurled the local blacksmith over a parapet into a stream, and it was only by paying over all the money which I could gather together that I was able to avert another public exposure. He had no friends at all save the wandering gipsies, and he would give these vagabonds leave to encamp upon the few acres of bramble-covered land which represent the family estate, and would accept in return the hospitality of their tents, wandering away with them sometimes for weeks on end. He has a passion also for Indian animals, which are sent over to him by a correspondent, and he has at this moment a cheetah and a baboon, which wander freely over his grounds and are feared by the villagers almost as much as their master.\n“You can imagine from what I say that my poor sister Julia and I had no great pleasure in our lives. No servant would stay with us, and for a long time we did all the work of the house. She was but thirty at the time of her death, and yet her hair had already begun to whiten, even as mine has.”\n“Your sister is dead, then?”\n“She died just two years ago, and it is of her death that I wish to speak to you. You can understand that, living the life which I have described, we were little likely to see anyone of our own age and position. We had, however, an aunt, my mother’s maiden sister, Miss Honoria Westphail, who lives near Harrow, and we were occasionally allowed to pay short visits at this lady’s house. Julia went there at Christmas two years ago, and met there a half-pay major of marines, to whom she became engaged. My stepfather learned of the engagement when my sister returned and offered no objection to the marriage; but within a fortnight of the day which had been fixed for the wedding, the terrible event occurred which has deprived me of my only companion.”",

            "prefix-probing": "“There is no vehicle save a dog-cart which throws up mud in that way, and then only when you sit on the left-hand side of the driver.” Holmes smiled at my look of incredulity. “You see, Watson, it is a matter of observation. The mud is thrown up by the offside wheel, and the dog-cart has a peculiar construction which causes this effect. I have noticed it before, and it is a useful clue in determining the type of vehicle involved in a chase or a flight.”\n\nWe were seated in the small sitting-room of 221B Baker Street, the fire crackling merrily in the grate, and the evening shadows lengthening on the walls. Holmes had just returned from a visit to the country, where he had been investigating a curious case involving a missing heir and a forged will. The details were still fresh in his mind, and he was eager to share them with me.\n\n“Tell me, Holmes,” I said, “how did you come to deduce the nature of the vehicle from such a trivial detail as the mud thrown up on the left-hand side?”\n\n“Ah, Watson, it is the little things which often hold the key to the larger mystery. When one has trained the eye to observe, the world reveals its secrets. In this case, the pattern of the mud spatter indicated the type of wheel and its position, which in turn suggested the kind of carriage. From there, I could infer the likely route taken and the identity of the driver.”\n\nI nodded, impressed as always by his powers of deduction. Holmes continued, “The case itself was most intriguing. A young man named Henry Baskerville had come to me with a tale of a family curse and a monstrous hound that haunted the moors. At first, I was inclined to dismiss it as superstition, but the evidence compelled me to investigate further.”\n\nHe leaned forward, his eyes gleaming with excitement. “We traveled to Dartmoor, where the Baskerville estate lay shrouded in mist and mystery. The locals spoke in hushed tones of the spectral hound, and strange footprints were found near the old manor. It was a perfect setting for a gothic tale, but I suspected a more earthly explanation.”\n\n“Did you find the hound, Holmes?” I asked.\n\n“Indeed, Watson, but not as a supernatural beast. It was a trained dog, used by a cunning villain to frighten the heir and seize the estate. The footprints were fabricated, and the howling was a trick of the wind and a cleverly disguised animal. The mud on the dog-cart, however, was a crucial clue that led me to the culprit.”\n\nHe paused, then added, “But that is a story for another evening. Tonight, I wish to discuss a different matter—a case of stolen jewels and a mysterious client who left no trace.”\n\nI settled back in my chair, eager to hear more. Holmes was in his element, weaving tales of crime and detection that never failed to captivate me. The night wore on, and the city outside grew quiet, but within the walls of 221B, the adventure was just beginning."

The manor-house is, as I have already said, very old, and only one wing is now inhabited. The bedrooms in this wing are on the ground floor, the sitting-rooms being in the central block of the buildings. Of these bedrooms the first is Dr. Roylott’s, the second my sister’s, and the third my own. There is no communication between them, but they all open out into the same corridor. Do I make myself plain?”\n“Perfectly so.”\n“The windows of the three rooms open out upon the lawn. That fatal night Dr. Roylott had gone to his room early, though we knew that he had not retired to rest, for my sister was troubled by the smell of the strong Indian cigars which it was his custom to smoke. She left her room, therefore, and came into mine, where she sat for some time, chatting about her approaching wedding. At eleven o’clock she rose to leave me, but she paused at the door and looked back.\n“‘Tell me, Helen,’ said she, ‘have you ever heard anyone whistle in the dead of the night?’\n“‘Never,’ said I.\n“‘I suppose that you could not possibly whistle, yourself, in your sleep?’\n“‘Certainly not. But why?’\n“‘Because during the last few nights I have always, about three in the morning, heard a low, clear whistle. I am a light sleeper, and it has awakened me. I cannot tell where it came from—perhaps from the next room, perhaps from the lawn. I thought that I would just ask you whether you had heard it.’\n“‘No, I have not. It must be those wretched gipsies in the plantation.’\n“‘Very likely. And yet if it were on the lawn, I wonder that you did not hear it also.’\n“‘Ah, but I sleep more heavily than you.’\n“‘Well, it is of no great consequence, at any rate.’ She smiled back at me, closed my door, and a few moments later I heard her key turn in the lock.”\n“Indeed,” said Holmes. “Was it your custom always to lock yourselves in at night?”\n“Always.”\n“And why?”\n“I think that I mentioned to you that the Doctor kept a cheetah and a baboon. We had no feeling of security unless our doors were locked.”\n“Quite so. Pray proceed with your statement.”\n“I could not sleep that night. A vague feeling of impending misfortune impressed me. My sister and I, you will recollect, were twins, and you know how subtle are the links which bind two souls which are so closely allied. It was a wild night. The wind was howling outside, and the rain was beating and splashing against the windows. Suddenly, amid all the hubbub of the gale, there burst forth the wild scream of a terrified woman. I knew that it was my sister’s voice. I sprang from my bed, wrapped a shawl round me, and rushed into the corridor. As I opened my door I seemed to hear a low whistle, such as my sister described, and a few moments later a clanging sound, as if a mass of metal had fallen. As I ran down the passage, my sister’s door was unlocked, and revolved slowly upon its hinges. I stared at it horror-stricken, not knowing what was about to issue from it. By the light of the corridor-lamp I saw my sister appear at the opening, her face blanched with terror, her hands groping for help, her whole figure swaying to and fro like that of a drunkard. I ran to her and threw my arms round her, but at that moment her knees seemed to give way and she fell to the ground. She writhed as one who is in terrible pain, and her limbs were dreadfully convulsed. At first I thought that she had not recognised me, but as I bent over her she suddenly shrieked out in a voice which I shall never forget, ‘Oh, my God! Helen! It was the band! The speckled band!’ There was something else which she would fain have said, and she stabbed with her finger into the air in the direction of the Doctor’s room, but a fresh convulsion seized her and choked her words. I rushed out, calling loudly for my stepfather, and I met him hastening from his room in his dressing-gown. When he reached my sister’s side she was unconscious, and though he poured brandy down her throat and sent for medical aid from the village, all efforts were in vain, for she slowly sank and died without having recovered her consciousness. Such was the dreadful end of my beloved sister.”\n“One moment,” said Holmes, “are you sure about this whistle and metallic sound? Could you swear to it?”\n“That was what the county coroner asked me at the inquiry. It is my strong impression that I heard it, and yet, among the crash of the gale and the creaking of an old house, I may possibly have been deceived.”\n“Was your sister dressed?”\n“No, she was in her night-dress. In her right hand was found the charred stump of a match, and in her left a match-box.”\n“Showing that she had struck a light and looked about her when the alarm took place. That is important. And what conclusions did the coroner come to?”\n“He investigated the case with great care, for Dr. Roylott’s conduct had long been notorious in the county, but he was unable to find any satisfactory cause of death. My evidence showed that the door had been fastened upon the inner side, and the windows were blocked by old-fashioned shutters with broad iron bars, which were secured every night. The walls were carefully sounded, and were shown to be quite solid all round, and the flooring was also thoroughly examined, with the same result. The chimney is wide, but is barred up by four large staples. It is certain, therefore, that my sister was quite alone when she met her end. Besides, there were no marks of any violence upon her.”\n“How about poison?”\n“The doctors examined her for it, but without success.”\n“What do you think that this unfortunate lady died of, then?”\n“It is my belief that she died of pure fear and nervous shock, though what it was that frightened her I cannot imagine.”\n“Were there gipsies in the plantation at the time?”\n“Yes, there are nearly always some there.”\n“Ah, and what did you gather from this allusion to a band—a speckled band?”\n“Sometimes I have thought that it was merely the wild talk of delirium, sometimes that it may have referred to some band of people, perhaps to these very gipsies in the plantation. I do not know whether the spotted handkerchiefs which so many of them wear over their heads might have suggested the strange adjective which she used.”\nHolmes shook his head like a man who is far from being satisfied.",

The room was dimly lit by the flickering firelight, casting long shadows upon the walls lined with books and curious artifacts. Holmes's keen eyes, though half-closed, still held that unmistakable spark of intelligence and alertness.\n\n\"You have come at an opportune moment,\" he said quietly. \"I was just pondering over a most perplexing case.\"\n\nHis visitor, a tall man with a furrowed brow and an air of urgency, stepped forward. \"Mr. Holmes, I am in desperate need of your assistance.\"\n\nHolmes sat upright, his interest evidently piqued. \"Pray, be seated and tell me all about it.\"\n\nThe man took a chair opposite Holmes and began to speak in a low, hurried voice. \"My name is John Rance, and I am a solicitor by profession. Recently, a peculiar matter has come to my attention involving a client of mine, a certain Miss Violet Hunter. She is a governess, and her situation is most unusual.\"\n\nHolmes nodded encouragingly. \"Proceed.\"\n\n\"Miss Hunter was employed by a Mr. Woodley, a man of considerable wealth who resides in a large country house. Shortly after her arrival, she began to experience strange occurrences—mysterious noises, unexplained shadows, and a general atmosphere of unease. She confided in me her fears that something was amiss, and I advised her to seek your counsel.\"\n\nHolmes steepled his fingers thoughtfully. \"Indeed, the supernatural often masks the most mundane of truths. Tell me, what is the nature of these occurrences?\"\n\n\"She has heard footsteps in the corridors at night, voices whispering in empty rooms, and once, she saw a figure standing at the foot of her bed.\"\n\n\"Fascinating,\" murmured Holmes. \"And what of Mr. Woodley?\"\n\n\"He is a reclusive man, rarely seen by the household staff. His demeanor is stern and unyielding, and he has forbidden Miss Hunter from exploring certain parts of the house.\"\n\nHolmes rose and began to pace the room. \"This is a case that demands immediate investigation. I shall accompany you to the estate at once.\"\n\nThe following day, Holmes and I traveled to the country house where Miss Hunter was employed. The mansion stood amidst sprawling grounds, its stone walls weathered by time. Upon our arrival, we were greeted by Miss Hunter herself, a composed young woman with sharp eyes and a resolute manner.\n\nShe led us through the grand hallways, pointing out the rooms where the strange events had occurred. Holmes listened intently, his gaze never wavering.\n\n\"Have you noticed any particular time when these phenomena are more frequent?\" he inquired.\n\n\"Mostly at night, between the hours of midnight and two,\" she replied.\n\nHolmes nodded. \"I shall require to stay here for a few nights to observe.\"\n\nThat evening, as darkness enveloped the house, Holmes and I took our positions in the room where Miss Hunter had reported the most unsettling experiences. The fire was low, and the silence was profound.\n\nSuddenly, a faint sound reached our ears—a soft tapping, like the gentle knock of a finger against wood. Holmes's eyes gleamed with anticipation.\n\n\"Stay alert,\" he whispered.\n\nThe tapping grew louder, followed by a faint rustling. Holmes sprang to his feet and moved toward the window. Outside, the moonlight revealed a shadowy figure retreating into the night.\n\n\"A visitor,\" Holmes remarked. \"But who?\"\n\nThe next morning, Holmes began his inquiries among the household staff. He questioned the butler, the maid, and the gardener, piecing together a timeline of events. It became apparent that the strange occurrences coincided with the arrival of a mysterious stranger seen lurking near the estate.\n\nHolmes's deductions led us to a hidden passage within the house, concealed behind a bookshelf in the library. The passage was narrow and dark, descending into the depths beneath the mansion.\n\nWith a lantern in hand, Holmes ventured into the passage, followed closely by Miss Hunter and myself. The air grew damp and cold as we descended, the silence broken only by our footsteps.\n\nAt the end of the passage, we discovered a small chamber containing a collection of stolen documents and valuables. It was clear that the house had been used as a hideout for illicit activities.\n\nHolmes's sharp mind connected the dots. The mysterious noises and shadows were the work of an intruder attempting to retrieve the hidden loot. The figure at the foot of Miss Hunter's bed was likely a ruse to frighten her away.\n\nWith this revelation, Holmes devised a plan to catch the culprit. That night, we lay in wait, concealed in the shadows. As the clock struck midnight, the intruder appeared—a man disguised in dark clothing, moving stealthily toward the hidden chamber.\n\nHolmes sprang into action, apprehending the man with swift precision. The intruder confessed to being a former associate of Mr. Woodley, seeking to reclaim stolen goods.\n\nThe mystery was resolved, and peace returned to the estate. Miss Hunter expressed her gratitude to Holmes, whose brilliance had once again unraveled the tangled threads of deception.\n\nAs we departed, Holmes remarked, \"The simplest explanation is often the correct one, but it requires a keen eye to see through the veil of fear and superstition.\"\n\nI could not help but admire his unparalleled intellect and unwavering dedication to justice. The adventure had been yet another testament to the extraordinary powers of Sherlock Holmes."

A month ago, however, a dear friend, whom I have known for many years, has done me the honour to ask my hand in marriage. His name is Armitage—Percy Armitage—the second son of Mr. Armitage, of Crane Water, near Reading. My stepfather has offered no opposition to the match, and we are to be married in the course of the spring. Two days ago some repairs were started in the west wing of the building, and my bedroom wall has been pierced, so that I have had to move into the chamber in which my sister died, and to sleep in the very bed in which she slept. Imagine, then, my thrill of terror when last night, as I lay awake, thinking over her terrible fate, I suddenly heard in the silence of the night the low whistle which had been the herald of her own death. I sprang up and lit the lamp, but nothing was to be seen in the room. I was too shaken to go to bed again, however, so I dressed, and as soon as it was daylight I slipped down, got a dog-cart at the Crown Inn, which is opposite, and drove to Leatherhead, from whence I have come on this morning with the one object of seeing you and asking your advice.”\n“You have done wisely,” said my friend. “But have you told me all?”\n“Yes, all.”\n“Miss Roylott, you have not. You are screening your stepfather.”\n“Why, what do you mean?”\nFor answer Holmes pushed back the frill of black lace which fringed the hand that lay upon our visitor’s knee. Five little livid spots, the marks of four fingers and a thumb, were printed upon the white wrist.\n“You have been cruelly used,” said Holmes.\nThe lady coloured deeply and covered over her injured wrist. “He is a hard man,” she said, “and perhaps he hardly knows his own strength.”\nThere was a long silence, during which Holmes leaned his chin upon his hands and stared into the crackling fire.\n“This is a very deep business,” he said at last. “There are a thousand details which I should desire to know before I decide upon our course of action. Yet we have not a moment to lose. If we were to come to Stoke Moran to-day, would it be possible for us to see over these rooms without the knowledge of your stepfather?”\n“As it happens, he spoke of coming into town to-day upon some most important business. It is probable that he will be away all day, and that there would be nothing to disturb you. We have a housekeeper now, but she is old and foolish, and I could easily get her out of the way.”\n“Excellent. You are not averse to this trip, Watson?”\n“By no means.”\n“Then we shall both come. What are you going to do yourself?”\n“I have one or two things which I would wish to do now that I am in town. But I shall return by the twelve o’clock train, so as to be there in time for your coming.”\n“And you may expect us early in the afternoon. I have myself some small business matters to attend to. Will you not wait and breakfast?”\n“No, I must go. My heart is lightened already since I have confided my trouble to you. I shall look forward to seeing you again this afternoon.” She dropped her thick black veil over her face and glided from the room.",

            "prefix-probing": "Holmes leaned back in his chair, his keen eyes fixed upon the speaker. \"Indeed, these are deep waters,\" he repeated thoughtfully. \"But it is in such depths that the truth often lies hidden, waiting for the patient diver to bring it to light. Now, as I was saying, the events of that evening were most peculiar.\"\n\n\"It began with a knock at my door, a sharp, insistent tapping that roused me from my reverie. Upon opening, I found a man of considerable agitation, his eyes darting nervously about the room. He introduced himself as Mr. John Openshaw, a gentleman of some standing, and implored my assistance in a matter of grave importance.\"\n\n\"He spoke of a family curse, a legacy of misfortune that had plagued his ancestors for generations. The tale was one of mystery and dread, involving a series of untimely deaths and unexplained disappearances. Mr. Openshaw believed that the latest in this line, his own brother, had fallen victim to the same sinister fate.\"\n\n\"I listened intently as he recounted the circumstances surrounding his brother's disappearance. The man had been last seen near the desolate moors, a place shrouded in mist and legend. There were whispers of a hidden treasure, a secret that had driven men to madness and despair.\"\n\n\"Intrigued by the story, I agreed to accompany Mr. Openshaw to the moors the following day. The landscape was bleak and unforgiving, the wind howling through the gnarled trees like the wails of lost souls. As we ventured deeper into the wilderness, the atmosphere grew heavier, as if the very air was charged with an unseen menace.\"\n\n\"Suddenly, a cry pierced the silence—a woman's voice, fraught with terror. We hurried towards the sound and discovered a young lady, her dress torn and face pale with fright. She identified herself as Miss Violet Hunter, a governess who had been employed at the nearby estate. She spoke of strange occurrences: footsteps in the night, eerie lights flickering in the windows, and a shadowy figure that haunted the halls.\"\n\n\"The plot thickened as we learned that the estate was connected to the Openshaw family, and that the missing brother had been investigating these very phenomena. It became clear that there was more at play than mere superstition; a human hand was manipulating events to sow fear and confusion.\"\n\n\"Determined to uncover the truth, we returned to the estate under the cover of darkness. Holmes's sharp intellect and keen observation skills soon revealed clues that had eluded the local authorities. A hidden passage, cleverly concealed behind a bookshelf, led us to a secret chamber where the missing man was held captive.\"\n\n\"The captor, a disgruntled relative seeking to claim the family fortune, was apprehended and brought to justice. The curse, it seemed, was nothing more than a fabrication designed to mask greed and treachery.\"\n\n\"Thus, the mystery was resolved, and the Openshaw family was freed from the shadow that had loomed over them. It was a testament to the power of reason and deduction, qualities that Holmes exemplified in every case he undertook.\"\n\n\"And so, my dear friend,\" Holmes concluded, \"we see once again that even the darkest of waters can be navigated with a steady hand and a clear mind. The truth, no matter how deeply buried, will always find its way to the surface.\""

          "text_segment": "“And what do you think of it all, Watson?” asked Sherlock Holmes, leaning back in his chair.\n“It seems to me to be a most dark and sinister business.”\n“Dark enough and sinister enough.”\n“Yet if the lady is correct in saying that the flooring and walls are sound, and that the door, window, and chimney are impassable, then her sister must have been undoubtedly alone when she met her mysterious end.”\n“What becomes, then, of these nocturnal whistles, and what of the very peculiar words of the dying woman?”\n“I cannot think.”\n“When you combine the ideas of whistles at night, the presence of a band of gipsies who are on intimate terms with this old doctor, the fact that we have every reason to believe that the doctor has an interest in preventing his stepdaughter’s marriage, the dying allusion to a band, and, finally, the fact that Miss Helen Stoner heard a metallic clang, which might have been caused by one of those metal bars that secured the shutters falling back into its place, I think that there is good ground to think that the mystery may be cleared along those lines.”\n“But what, then, did the gipsies do?”\n“I cannot imagine.”\n“I see many objections to any such theory.”\n“And so do I. It is precisely for that reason that we are going to Stoke Moran this day. I want to see whether the objections are fatal, or if they may be explained away. But what in the name of the devil!”\nThe ejaculation had been drawn from my companion by the fact that our door had been suddenly dashed open, and that a huge man had framed himself in the aperture. His costume was a peculiar mixture of the professional and of the agricultural, having a black top-hat, a long frock-coat, and a pair of high gaiters, with a hunting-crop swinging in his hand. So tall was he that his hat actually brushed the cross bar of the doorway, and his breadth seemed to span it across from side to side. A large face, seared with a thousand wrinkles, burned yellow with the sun, and marked with every evil passion, was turned from one to the other of us, while his deep-set, bile-shot eyes, and his high, thin, fleshless nose, gave him somewhat the resemblance to a fierce old bird of prey.\n“Which of you is Holmes?” asked this apparition.\n“My name, sir; but you have the advantage of me,” said my companion quietly.\n“I am Dr. Grimesby Roylott, of Stoke Moran.”\n“Indeed, Doctor,” said Holmes blandly. “Pray take a seat.”\n“I will do nothing of the kind. My stepdaughter has been here. I have traced her. What has she been saying to you?”\n“It is a little cold for the time of the year,” said Holmes.\n“What has she been saying to you?” screamed the old man furiously.\n“But I have heard that the crocuses promise well,” continued my companion imperturbably.\n“Ha! You put me off, do you?” said our new visitor, taking a step forward and shaking his hunting-crop. “I know you, you scoundrel! I have heard of you before. You are Holmes, the meddler.”\nMy friend smiled.\n“Holmes, the busybody!”\nHis smile broadened.\n“Holmes, the Scotland Yard Jack-in-office!”\nHolmes chuckled heartily. “Your conversation is most entertaining,” said he. “When you go out close the door, for there is a decided draught.”\n“I will go when I have had my say. Don’t you dare to meddle with my affairs. I know that Miss Stoner has been here. I traced her! I am a dangerous man to fall foul of! See here.” He stepped swiftly forward, seized the poker, and bent it into a curve with his huge brown hands.\n“See that you keep yourself out of my grip,” he snarled, and hurling the twisted poker into the fireplace he strode out of the room.\n“He seems a very amiable person,” said Holmes, laughing. “I am not quite so bulky, but if he had remained I might have shown him that my grip was not much more feeble than his own.” As he spoke he picked up the steel poker and, with a sudden effort, straightened it out again.\n“Fancy his having the insolence to confound me with the official detective force! This incident gives zest to our investigation, however, and I only trust that our little friend will not suffer from her imprudence in allowing this brute to trace her. And now, Watson, we shall order breakfast, and afterwards I shall walk down to Doctors’ Commons, where I hope to get some data which may help us in this matter.”",

            "prefix-probing": "I looked thoughtfully at my old friend, the flickering fire casting dancing shadows across his sharp features. \"It is a curious case, Holmes,\" I replied, \"one that challenges even your formidable powers of deduction. The disappearance of the emerald necklace, the mysterious footprints in the garden, and the cryptic note left behind—all seem to weave a tangled web of intrigue.\"\n\nHolmes steepled his fingers, his eyes gleaming with that familiar spark of excitement. \"Indeed, Watson. The game is afoot, as I have often said. The key lies not in the obvious, but in the subtle details overlooked by the casual observer.\"\n\nI nodded, recalling the events that had led us here. Lady Margaret had come to us in distress, her prized emerald necklace vanished from her locked cabinet. The only clues were the footprints of a small dog and a note bearing the words, 'The truth lies beneath the surface.'\n\n\"Have you considered the possibility that the dog was used as a diversion?\" I ventured.\n\nHolmes smiled faintly. \"Precisely, my dear Watson. The footprints are genuine, but their purpose is to mislead. The note, too, is a riddle meant to confound.\"\n\nWe decided to visit Lady Margaret's estate once more, hoping to uncover what had been missed. Upon arrival, Holmes immediately examined the cabinet where the necklace had been kept. He tapped the wood lightly, listening for any hollow sounds.\n\n\"A secret compartment,\" he murmured. \"Just as I suspected.\"\n\nWith deft fingers, he pried open a hidden panel, revealing a small box containing the missing necklace. Lady Margaret gasped in relief.\n\n\"But who could have hidden it here?\" she asked.\n\nHolmes's gaze turned sharp. \"Someone close to you, perhaps, who wished to protect the necklace from theft.\"\n\nThe household staff were questioned, and it emerged that the butler had recently taken a leave of absence under mysterious circumstances. Further investigation revealed that he had discovered a plot to steal the necklace and had hidden it to safeguard it.\n\nAs the mystery unraveled, I marveled at Holmes's brilliance. \"Once again, you have proven that no puzzle is too complex for your mind.\"\n\nHe smiled modestly. \"It is the details, Watson, the small things that others overlook, which reveal the truth.\"\n\nOur adventure concluded, I felt a renewed admiration for my friend's unparalleled intellect and the enduring thrill of the detective's art."

          "text_segment": "It was nearly one o’clock when Sherlock Holmes returned from his excursion. He held in his hand a sheet of blue paper, scrawled over with notes and figures.\n“I have seen the will of the deceased wife,” said he. “To determine its exact meaning I have been obliged to work out the present prices of the investments with which it is concerned. The total income, which at the time of the wife’s death was little short of £ 1,100, is now, through the fall in agricultural prices, not more than £ 750. Each daughter can claim an income of £ 250, in case of marriage. It is evident, therefore, that if both girls had married, this beauty would have had a mere pittance, while even one of them would cripple him to a very serious extent. My morning’s work has not been wasted, since it has proved that he has the very strongest motives for standing in the way of anything of the sort. And now, Watson, this is too serious for dawdling, especially as the old man is aware that we are interesting ourselves in his affairs; so if you are ready, we shall call a cab and drive to Waterloo. I should be very much obliged if you would slip your revolver into your pocket. An Eley’s No. 2 is an excellent argument with gentlemen who can twist steel pokers into knots. That and a tooth-brush are, I think, all that we need.”\nAt Waterloo we were fortunate in catching a train for Leatherhead, where we hired a trap at the station inn and drove for four or five miles through the lovely Surrey lanes. It was a perfect day, with a bright sun and a few fleecy clouds in the heavens. The trees and wayside hedges were just throwing out their first green shoots, and the air was full of the pleasant smell of the moist earth. To me at least there was a strange contrast between the sweet promise of the spring and this sinister quest upon which we were engaged. My companion sat in the front of the trap, his arms folded, his hat pulled down over his eyes, and his chin sunk upon his breast, buried in the deepest thought. Suddenly, however, he started, tapped me on the shoulder, and pointed over the meadows.\n“Look there!” said he.\nA heavily timbered park stretched up in a gentle slope, thickening into a grove at the highest point. From amid the branches there jutted out the grey gables and high roof-tree of a very old mansion.\n“Stoke Moran?” said he.\n“Yes, sir, that be the house of Dr. Grimesby Roylott,” remarked the driver.\n“There is some building going on there,” said Holmes; “that is where we are going.”\n“There’s the village,” said the driver, pointing to a cluster of roofs some distance to the left; “but if you want to get to the house, you’ll find it shorter to get over this stile, and so by the footpath over the fields. There it is, where the lady is walking.”\n“And the lady, I fancy, is Miss Stoner,” observed Holmes, shading his eyes. “Yes, I think we had better do as you suggest.”\nWe got off, paid our fare, and the trap rattled back on its way to Leatherhead.\n“I thought it as well,” said Holmes as we climbed the stile, “that this fellow should think we had come here as architects, or on some definite business. It may stop his gossip. Good-afternoon, Miss Stoner. You see that we have been as good as our word.”\nOur client of the morning had hurried forward to meet us with a face which spoke her joy. “I have been waiting so eagerly for you,” she cried, shaking hands with us warmly. “All has turned out splendidly. Dr. Roylott has gone to town, and it is unlikely that he will be back before evening.”\n“We have had the pleasure of making the Doctor’s acquaintance,” said Holmes, and in a few words he sketched out what had occurred. Miss Stoner turned white to the lips as she listened.\n“Good heavens!” she cried, “he has followed me, then.”\n“So it appears.”\n“He is so cunning that I never know when I am safe from him. What will he say when he returns?”\n“He must guard himself, for he may find that there is someone more cunning than himself upon his track. You must lock yourself up from him to-night. If he is violent, we shall take you away to your aunt’s at Harrow. Now, we must make the best use of our time, so kindly take us at once to the rooms which we are to examine.”",

            "prefix-probing": "It was nearly one o’clock when Sherlock Holmes returned from his excursion. The morning had been spent in a series of investigations that had taken him across the city, and now, as he entered the familiar rooms of 221B Baker Street, his keen eyes sparkled with the thrill of discovery. Dr. Watson, who had been awaiting his return with a mixture of impatience and curiosity, rose from his chair and greeted his friend with a warm smile.\n\n\"Well, Holmes,\" said Watson, \"have you made any progress in the matter of the missing jewels?\"\n\nHolmes nodded, his fingers steepled beneath his chin. \"Indeed, Watson. The case is more intricate than it first appeared. The clues we have gathered point to a cunning adversary, one who has taken great pains to cover his tracks.\"\n\nWatson settled back into his seat, eager to hear the details. \"Pray, do enlighten me.\"\n\nHolmes began to recount the events of the morning. \"I visited the residence of Lady Brackenstall, where the theft occurred. The scene of the crime was meticulously examined, and I noted several peculiarities. For instance, the window through which the thief is believed to have entered was found to be locked from the inside, yet there were no signs of forced entry elsewhere.\"\n\n\"Curious,\" murmured Watson. \"Could it have been an inside job?\"\n\n\"That is one possibility,\" Holmes agreed. \"However, I also discovered a faint trace of a particular scent near the window—a mixture of tobacco and a rare perfume. This led me to the nearby tobacconist, where I learned that only one customer had purchased the specific brand of tobacco in the last week.\"\n\n\"And who might that be?\" asked Watson.\n\n\"A gentleman named Mr. James Mortimer,\" replied Holmes. \"He is known to frequent the area and has a reputation for being somewhat of a dandy. I intend to pay him a visit this afternoon.\"\n\nAs Holmes spoke, the doorbell rang, and Mrs. Hudson entered with a visitor. It was Inspector Lestrade, who had come to discuss the case.\n\n\"Good afternoon, gentlemen,\" said Lestrade. \"I hear you have made some headway.\"\n\nHolmes nodded. \"Yes, Inspector. I believe we are closing in on the culprit.\"\n\nLestrade looked skeptical. \"I hope so. The pressure is mounting, and the public demands results.\"\n\nHolmes smiled faintly. \"Patience, Inspector. The game is afoot, and soon the truth will be revealed.\"\n\nAfter Lestrade departed, Holmes and Watson prepared to visit Mr. Mortimer. The afternoon sun cast long shadows as they made their way through the bustling streets. Upon reaching Mortimer's residence, they were greeted by a man of impeccable dress and manner.\n\n\"Mr. Mortimer,\" said Holmes, \"I have some questions regarding your recent activities.\"\n\nMortimer appeared composed but wary. \"I assure you, Mr. Holmes, I have nothing to hide.\"\n\nHolmes observed him closely. \"Then perhaps you can explain the presence of your tobacco scent at Lady Brackenstall's window.\"\n\nMortimer's eyes flickered momentarily. \"I admit I was in the vicinity, but I had no involvement in the theft.\"\n\nHolmes pressed on, presenting the evidence he had gathered. As the conversation unfolded, it became clear that Mortimer was not the thief but rather a pawn in a larger scheme.\n\nReturning to Baker Street, Holmes shared his insights with Watson. \"The true culprit is someone who has exploited Mortimer's vanity and penchant for fine tobacco to divert suspicion.\"\n\nWatson nodded. \"Then our task is to uncover who stands to gain from the jewels' disappearance.\"\n\nHolmes smiled. \"Precisely, my dear Watson. And I believe our next step lies in examining the social circles of Lady Brackenstall.\"\n\nThus, the investigation continued, with Holmes and Watson delving deeper into the mysteries that surrounded the missing jewels, their minds sharp and their resolve unwavering."

          "text_segment": "The building was of grey, lichen-blotched stone, with a high central portion and two curving wings, like the claws of a crab, thrown out on each side. In one of these wings the windows were broken and blocked with wooden boards, while the roof was partly caved in, a picture of ruin. The central portion was in little better repair, but the right-hand block was comparatively modern, and the blinds in the windows, with the blue smoke curling up from the chimneys, showed that this was where the family resided. Some scaffolding had been erected against the end wall, and the stone-work had been broken into, but there were no signs of any workmen at the moment of our visit. Holmes walked slowly up and down the ill-trimmed lawn and examined with deep attention the outsides of the windows.\n“This, I take it, belongs to the room in which you used to sleep, the centre one to your sister’s, and the one next to the main building to Dr. Roylott’s chamber?”\n“Exactly so. But I am now sleeping in the middle one.”\n“Pending the alterations, as I understand. By the way, there does not seem to be any very pressing need for repairs at that end wall.”\n“There were none. I believe that it was an excuse to move me from my room.”\n“Ah! that is suggestive. Now, on the other side of this narrow wing runs the corridor from which these three rooms open. There are windows in it, of course?”\n“Yes, but very small ones. Too narrow for anyone to pass through.”\n“As you both locked your doors at night, your rooms were unapproachable from that side. Now, would you have the kindness to go into your room and bar your shutters?”\nMiss Stoner did so, and Holmes, after a careful examination through the open window, endeavoured in every way to force the shutter open, but without success. There was no slit through which a knife could be passed to raise the bar. Then with his lens he tested the hinges, but they were of solid iron, built firmly into the massive masonry. “Hum!” said he, scratching his chin in some perplexity, “my theory certainly presents some difficulties. No one could pass these shutters if they were bolted. Well, we shall see if the inside throws any light upon the matter.”\nA small side door led into the whitewashed corridor from which the three bedrooms opened. Holmes refused to examine the third chamber, so we passed at once to the second, that in which Miss Stoner was now sleeping, and in which her sister had met with her fate. It was a homely little room, with a low ceiling and a gaping fireplace, after the fashion of old country-houses. A brown chest of drawers stood in one corner, a narrow white-counterpaned bed in another, and a dressing-table on the left-hand side of the window. These articles, with two small wicker-work chairs, made up all the furniture in the room save for a square of Wilton carpet in the centre. The boards round and the panelling of the walls were of brown, worm-eaten oak, so old and discoloured that it may have dated from the original building of the house. Holmes drew one of the chairs into a corner and sat silent, while his eyes travelled round and round and up and down, taking in every detail of the apartment.\n“Where does that bell communicate with?” he asked at last pointing to a thick bell-rope which hung down beside the bed, the tassel actually lying upon the pillow.\n“It goes to the housekeeper’s room.”\n“It looks newer than the other things?”\n“Yes, it was only put there a couple of years ago.”\n“Your sister asked for it, I suppose?”\n“No, I never heard of her using it. We used always to get what we wanted for ourselves.”\n“Indeed, it seemed unnecessary to put so nice a bell-pull there. You will excuse me for a few minutes while I satisfy myself as to this floor.” He threw himself down upon his face with his lens in his hand and crawled swiftly backward and forward, examining minutely the cracks between the boards. Then he did the same with the wood-work with which the chamber was panelled. Finally he walked over to the bed and spent some time in staring at it and in running his eye up and down the wall. Finally he took the bell-rope in his hand and gave it a brisk tug.\n“Why, it’s a dummy,” said he.\n“Won’t it ring?”\n“No, it is not even attached to a wire. This is very interesting. You can see now that it is fastened to a hook just above where the little opening for the ventilator is.”\n“How very absurd! I never noticed that before.”\n“Very strange!” muttered Holmes, pulling at the rope. “There are one or two very singular points about this room. For example, what a fool a builder must be to open a ventilator into another room, when, with the same trouble, he might have communicated with the outside air!”\n“That is also quite modern,” said the lady.\n“Done about the same time as the bell-rope?” remarked Holmes.\n“Yes, there were several little changes carried out about that time.”\n“They seem to have been of a most interesting character—dummy bell-ropes, and ventilators which do not ventilate. With your permission, Miss Stoner, we shall now carry our researches into the inner apartment.”\nDr. Grimesby Roylott’s chamber was larger than that of his step-daughter, but was as plainly furnished. A camp-bed, a small wooden shelf full of books, mostly of a technical character, an armchair beside the bed, a plain wooden chair against the wall, a round table, and a large iron safe were the principal things which met the eye. Holmes walked slowly round and examined each and all of them with the keenest interest.\n“What’s in here?” he asked, tapping the safe.\n“My stepfather’s business papers.”\n“Oh! you have seen inside, then?”\n“Only once, some years ago. I remember that it was full of papers.”\n“There isn’t a cat in it, for example?”\n“No. What a strange idea!”\n“Well, look at this!” He took up a small saucer of milk which stood on the top of it.\n“No; we don’t keep a cat. But there is a cheetah and a baboon.”\n“Ah, yes, of course! Well, a cheetah is just a big cat, and yet a saucer of milk does not go very far in satisfying its wants, I daresay. There is one point which I should wish to determine.” He squatted down in front of the wooden chair and examined the seat of it with the greatest attention.\n“Thank you. That is quite settled,” said he, rising and putting his lens in his pocket. “Hullo! Here is something interesting!”\nThe object which had caught his eye was a small dog lash hung on one corner of the bed. The lash, however, was curled upon itself and tied so as to make a loop of whipcord.\n“What do you make of that, Watson?”\n“It’s a common enough lash. But I don’t know why it should be tied.”\n“That is not quite so common, is it? Ah, me! it’s a wicked world, and when a clever man turns his brains to crime it is the worst of all. I think that I have seen enough now, Miss Stoner, and with your permission we shall walk out upon the lawn.”",

            "prefix-probing": "The building was of grey, lichen-blotched stone, with a high central portion and two curving wings, like the claws of a crab, thrown out on each side. It stood solemn and silent against the bleak moorland, its windows staring like dark, unblinking eyes into the gathering dusk. The air was heavy with the scent of damp earth and the distant cry of a lone curlew echoed across the desolate landscape.\n\nInside, the atmosphere was no less somber. The great hall was lined with ancient tapestries, their colors faded and threads worn thin by the passage of time. A massive fireplace dominated one wall, its hearth cold and empty, save for the faintest trace of ash. The heavy oak table at the center bore the marks of countless gatherings, its surface scarred and polished by generations of hands.\n\nSherlock Holmes stood by the window, his keen eyes scanning the horizon. Beside him, Dr. Watson observed the scene with a mixture of curiosity and unease. The case that had brought them here was unlike any they had encountered before—a mystery shrouded in secrecy and shadow, whispered about in hushed tones among the locals.\n\n\"The key lies in the history of this place,\" Holmes mused, his fingers steepled beneath his chin. \"Every stone, every creak of the floorboards, tells a story. We must listen carefully if we are to unravel the truth.\"\n\nWatson nodded, his gaze drifting to the portraits that lined the walls—stoic faces of ancestors long gone, their eyes seeming to follow the visitors with a silent, watchful presence. \"It is as if the house itself holds its breath, waiting for the secrets to be uncovered.\"\n\nTheir investigation began with the servants, who spoke in guarded tones of strange noises and flickering lights in the dead of night. An old gardener recounted tales of a hidden passage beneath the east wing, sealed off for decades but rumored to be the site of clandestine meetings and forbidden rendezvous.\n\nHolmes listened intently, piecing together fragments of information with his characteristic precision. \"We must examine this passage,\" he declared. \"It may hold the key to understanding the events that have transpired here.\"\n\nUnder the cover of darkness, the two men ventured into the shadowed corridors, their footsteps echoing softly against the stone walls. A faint draft led them to a concealed door, its surface camouflaged by layers of dust and cobwebs. With a practiced hand, Holmes manipulated the lock, and the door creaked open to reveal a narrow staircase spiraling downward into the depths.\n\nThe air grew colder as they descended, the faint glow of their lantern casting eerie shadows that danced upon the damp walls. At the base of the stairs, they found themselves in a subterranean chamber, its walls lined with shelves cluttered with dusty tomes and faded parchments.\n\nAmong the relics, a leather-bound journal caught Holmes's attention. Its pages were brittle, the ink faded but still legible. As he read aloud, the story unfolded—a tale of betrayal, lost love, and a secret that had been buried for generations.\n\nThe journal spoke of a forbidden affair between the lady of the house and a mysterious stranger, whose identity had been concealed to protect the family's honor. It hinted at a hidden treasure, concealed within the very walls of the estate, and a curse that would befall anyone who dared to seek it.\n\nHolmes's eyes gleamed with excitement. \"This is the heart of the mystery, Watson. We must follow the clues laid out in this journal to uncover the truth.\"\n\nTheir search led them through hidden compartments and forgotten rooms, each discovery bringing them closer to the secret that had eluded so many before them. Along the way, they encountered obstacles—traps set to deter intruders, cryptic riddles etched into stone, and the ever-present sense of being watched.\n\nYet, with unwavering determination and Holmes's unparalleled intellect, they pressed on. At last, they uncovered a concealed chamber, its walls adorned with ancient symbols and a chest resting upon a pedestal.\n\nInside the chest lay a collection of priceless artifacts—jewels, letters, and a portrait of the mysterious stranger, revealing him to be a nobleman of great renown. The revelation shed new light on the history of the estate and the true nature of the curse.\n\nAs dawn broke over the moor, Holmes and Watson emerged from the depths, their minds enriched by the secrets they had unveiled. The house, once a silent sentinel of mystery, now stood as a testament to the enduring power of truth and the relentless pursuit of justice."

          "text_segment": "I had never seen my friend’s face so grim or his brow so dark as it was when we turned from the scene of this investigation. We had walked several times up and down the lawn, neither Miss Stoner nor myself liking to break in upon his thoughts before he roused himself from his reverie.\n“It is very essential, Miss Stoner,” said he, “that you should absolutely follow my advice in every respect.”\n“I shall most certainly do so.”\n“The matter is too serious for any hesitation. Your life may depend upon your compliance.”\n“I assure you that I am in your hands.”\n“In the first place, both my friend and I must spend the night in your room.”\nBoth Miss Stoner and I gazed at him in astonishment.\n“Yes, it must be so. Let me explain. I believe that that is the village inn over there?”\n“Yes, that is the Crown.”\n“Very good. Your windows would be visible from there?”\n“Certainly.”\n“You must confine yourself to your room, on pretence of a headache, when your stepfather comes back. Then when you hear him retire for the night, you must open the shutters of your window, undo the hasp, put your lamp there as a signal to us, and then withdraw quietly with everything which you are likely to want into the room which you used to occupy. I have no doubt that, in spite of the repairs, you could manage there for one night.”\n“Oh, yes, easily.”\n“The rest you will leave in our hands.”\n“But what will you do?”\n“We shall spend the night in your room, and we shall investigate the cause of this noise which has disturbed you.”\n“I believe, Mr. Holmes, that you have already made up your mind,” said Miss Stoner, laying her hand upon my companion’s sleeve.\n“Perhaps I have.”\n“Then, for pity’s sake, tell me what was the cause of my sister’s death.”\n“I should prefer to have clearer proofs before I speak.”\n“You can at least tell me whether my own thought is correct, and if she died from some sudden fright.”\n“No, I do not think so. I think that there was probably some more tangible cause. And now, Miss Stoner, we must leave you for if Dr. Roylott returned and saw us our journey would be in vain. Good-bye, and be brave, for if you will do what I have told you, you may rest assured that we shall soon drive away the dangers that threaten you.”\nSherlock Holmes and I had no difficulty in engaging a bedroom and sitting-room at the Crown Inn. They were on the upper floor, and from our window we could command a view of the avenue gate, and of the inhabited wing of Stoke Moran Manor House. At dusk we saw Dr. Grimesby Roylott drive past, his huge form looming up beside the little figure of the lad who drove him. The boy had some slight difficulty in undoing the heavy iron gates, and we heard the hoarse roar of the Doctor’s voice and saw the fury with which he shook his clinched fists at him. The trap drove on, and a few minutes later we saw a sudden light spring up among the trees as the lamp was lit in one of the sitting-rooms.\n“Do you know, Watson,” said Holmes as we sat together in the gathering darkness, “I have really some scruples as to taking you to-night. There is a distinct element of danger.”\n“Can I be of assistance?”\n“Your presence might be invaluable.”\n“Then I shall certainly come.”\n“It is very kind of you.”\n“You speak of danger. You have evidently seen more in these rooms than was visible to me.”\n“No, but I fancy that I may have deduced a little more. I imagine that you saw all that I did.”\n“I saw nothing remarkable save the bell-rope, and what purpose that could answer I confess is more than I can imagine.”\n“You saw the ventilator, too?”\n“Yes, but I do not think that it is such a very unusual thing to have a small opening between two rooms. It was so small that a rat could hardly pass through.”\n“I knew that we should find a ventilator before ever we came to Stoke Moran.”\n“My dear Holmes!”\n“Oh, yes, I did. You remember in her statement she said that her sister could smell Dr. Roylott’s cigar. Now, of course that suggested at once that there must be a communication between the two rooms. It could only be a small one, or it would have been remarked upon at the coroner’s inquiry. I deduced a ventilator.”\n“But what harm can there be in that?”\n“Well, there is at least a curious coincidence of dates. A ventilator is made, a cord is hung, and a lady who sleeps in the bed dies. Does not that strike you?”\n“I cannot as yet see any connection.”\n“Did you observe anything very peculiar about that bed?”\n“No.”\n“It was clamped to the floor. Did you ever see a bed fastened like that before?”\n“I cannot say that I have.”\n“The lady could not move her bed. It must always be in the same relative position to the ventilator and to the rope—or so we may call it, since it was clearly never meant for a bell-pull.”\n“Holmes,” I cried, “I seem to see dimly what you are hinting at. We are only just in time to prevent some subtle and horrible crime.”\n“Subtle enough and horrible enough. When a doctor does go wrong he is the first of criminals. He has nerve and he has knowledge. Palmer and Pritchard were among the heads of their profession. This man strikes even deeper, but I think, Watson, that we shall be able to strike deeper still. But we shall have horrors enough before the night is over; for goodness’ sake let us have a quiet pipe and turn our minds for a few hours to something more cheerful.”",

The dim light of the gas lamps flickered against the wet pavement, casting long shadows that seemed to mirror the somber mood that had settled upon us. Holmes walked with a measured step, his keen eyes fixed ahead, lost in thought. I, too, was silent, pondering the strange and troubling events that had unfolded before us.\n\nThe case had begun with a simple request for assistance, a plea from a distressed client whose life had been upended by a series of inexplicable occurrences. Yet, as we delved deeper, the mystery had grown more complex, revealing layers of deceit, danger, and desperation. The clues were scattered like fragments of a shattered mirror, each reflecting a different facet of the truth we sought to uncover.\n\nHolmes’s mind was a labyrinth of deductions and hypotheses, weaving together the threads of evidence with the precision of a master craftsman. He spoke little, but when he did, his words were sharp and incisive, cutting through the fog of uncertainty. I could see the weight of the case pressing upon him, a burden he bore with stoic resolve.\n\nAs we reached our lodgings, Holmes paused and turned to me, his eyes gleaming with a mixture of determination and unease. “Watson,” he said, “this is no ordinary matter. The forces at play are darker and more insidious than we first imagined. We must proceed with caution, for the path ahead is fraught with peril.”\n\nI nodded, understanding the gravity of his words. The night was deepening, and with it, the shadows that concealed the truth. Yet, I had faith in Holmes’s unparalleled intellect and unwavering courage. Together, we would unravel the mystery, no matter the cost.\n\nThe following morning, Holmes was already at work, poring over the notes and evidence we had gathered. His fingers traced the lines of a map, marking locations and connections with meticulous care. I watched as he pieced together the puzzle, each revelation bringing us closer to the heart of the enigma.\n\nOur investigation led us to the bustling streets of London, where the city's underbelly whispered secrets to those who would listen. We visited dimly lit taverns and shadowed alleyways, speaking with informants and witnesses whose tales were as varied as they were unreliable. Yet, Holmes’s discerning mind sifted through the noise, extracting the kernels of truth hidden within.\n\nOne evening, as we sat by the fire in our rooms at Baker Street, Holmes shared his latest deductions. “The key lies in the seemingly insignificant details, Watson,” he explained. “A misplaced word, a fleeting glance, a subtle gesture—these are the clues that reveal the true nature of the players involved.”\n\nHe recounted the events with clarity and insight, painting a vivid picture of the intricate web of motives and machinations. I marveled at his ability to see beyond the surface, to perceive the invisible threads that bound the narrative together.\n\nDays turned into weeks as we pursued leads and confronted dangers. The case tested our resolve and ingenuity, challenging us to think beyond conventional boundaries. Yet, through perseverance and intellect, we began to unravel the mystery, exposing the hidden forces that sought to manipulate and deceive.\n\nIn the end, justice prevailed, and the truth was brought to light. The client’s plight was resolved, and the shadows that had loomed over the case were dispelled. Holmes’s satisfaction was evident, though tempered by the knowledge that such darkness often lurked beneath the veneer of society.\n\nAs we reflected on the journey, I was reminded of the enduring power of reason and the unyielding spirit of inquiry. The adventure had tested us, but it had also reaffirmed the bond between us and the noble pursuit of truth. And so, with the mystery behind us, we looked forward to the next challenge that awaited, confident in our ability to face whatever mysteries the world might present."

          "text_segment": "About nine o’clock the light among the trees was extinguished, and all was dark in the direction of the Manor House. Two hours passed slowly away, and then, suddenly, just at the stroke of eleven, a single bright light shone out right in front of us.\n“That is our signal,” said Holmes, springing to his feet; “it comes from the middle window.”\nAs we passed out he exchanged a few words with the landlord, explaining that we were going on a late visit to an acquaintance, and that it was possible that we might spend the night there. A moment later we were out on the dark road, a chill wind blowing in our faces, and one yellow light twinkling in front of us through the gloom to guide us on our sombre errand.\nThere was little difficulty in entering the grounds, for unrepaired breaches gaped in the old park wall. Making our way among the trees, we reached the lawn, crossed it, and were about to enter through the window when out from a clump of laurel bushes there darted what seemed to be a hideous and distorted child, who threw itself upon the grass with writhing limbs and then ran swiftly across the lawn into the darkness.\n“My God!” I whispered; “did you see it?”\nHolmes was for the moment as startled as I. His hand closed like a vice upon my wrist in his agitation. Then he broke into a low laugh and put his lips to my ear.\n“It is a nice household,” he murmured. “That is the baboon.”\nI had forgotten the strange pets which the Doctor affected. There was a cheetah, too; perhaps we might find it upon our shoulders at any moment. I confess that I felt easier in my mind when, after following Holmes’ example and slipping off my shoes, I found myself inside the bedroom. My companion noiselessly closed the shutters, moved the lamp onto the table, and cast his eyes round the room. All was as we had seen it in the daytime. Then creeping up to me and making a trumpet of his hand, he whispered into my ear again so gently that it was all that I could do to distinguish the words:\n“The least sound would be fatal to our plans.”\nI nodded to show that I had heard.\n“We must sit without light. He would see it through the ventilator.”\nI nodded again.\n“Do not go asleep; your very life may depend upon it. Have your pistol ready in case we should need it. I will sit on the side of the bed, and you in that chair.”\nI took out my revolver and laid it on the corner of the table.\nHolmes had brought up a long thin cane, and this he placed upon the bed beside him. By it he laid the box of matches and the stump of a candle. Then he turned down the lamp, and we were left in darkness.\nHow shall I ever forget that dreadful vigil? I could not hear a sound, not even the drawing of a breath, and yet I knew that my companion sat open-eyed, within a few feet of me, in the same state of nervous tension in which I was myself. The shutters cut off the least ray of light, and we waited in absolute darkness.\nFrom outside came the occasional cry of a night-bird, and once at our very window a long drawn catlike whine, which told us that the cheetah was indeed at liberty. Far away we could hear the deep tones of the parish clock, which boomed out every quarter of an hour. How long they seemed, those quarters! Twelve struck, and one and two and three, and still we sat waiting silently for whatever might befall.\nSuddenly there was the momentary gleam of a light up in the direction of the ventilator, which vanished immediately, but was succeeded by a strong smell of burning oil and heated metal. Someone in the next room had lit a dark-lantern. I heard a gentle sound of movement, and then all was silent once more, though the smell grew stronger. For half an hour I sat with straining ears. Then suddenly another sound became audible—a very gentle, soothing sound, like that of a small jet of steam escaping continually from a kettle. The instant that we heard it, Holmes sprang from the bed, struck a match, and lashed furiously with his cane at the bell-pull.\n“You see it, Watson?” he yelled. “You see it?”\nBut I saw nothing. At the moment when Holmes struck the light I heard a low, clear whistle, but the sudden glare flashing into my weary eyes made it impossible for me to tell what it was at which my friend lashed so savagely. I could, however, see that his face was deadly pale and filled with horror and loathing. He had ceased to strike and was gazing up at the ventilator when suddenly there broke from the silence of the night the most horrible cry to which I have ever listened. It swelled up louder and louder, a hoarse yell of pain and fear and anger all mingled in the one dreadful shriek. They say that away down in the village, and even in the distant parsonage, that cry raised the sleepers from their beds. It struck cold to our hearts, and I stood gazing at Holmes, and he at me, until the last echoes of it had died away into the silence from which it rose.\n“What can it mean?” I gasped.\n“It means that it is all over,” Holmes answered. “And perhaps, after all, it is for the best. Take your pistol, and we will enter Dr. Roylott’s room.”\nWith a grave face he lit the lamp and led the way down the corridor. Twice he struck at the chamber door without any reply from within. Then he turned the handle and entered, I at his heels, with the cocked pistol in my hand.\nIt was a singular sight which met our eyes. On the table stood a dark-lantern with the shutter half open, throwing a brilliant beam of light upon the iron safe, the door of which was ajar. Beside this table, on the wooden chair, sat Dr. Grimesby Roylott clad in a long grey dressing-gown, his bare ankles protruding beneath, and his feet thrust into red heelless Turkish slippers. Across his lap lay the short stock with the long lash which we had noticed during the day. His chin was cocked upward and his eyes were fixed in a dreadful, rigid stare at the corner of the ceiling. Round his brow he had a peculiar yellow band, with brownish speckles, which seemed to be bound tightly round his head. As we entered he made neither sound nor motion.\n“The band! the speckled band!” whispered Holmes.\nI took a step forward. In an instant his strange headgear began to move, and there reared itself from among his hair the squat diamond-shaped head and puffed neck of a loathsome serpent.\n“It is a swamp adder!” cried Holmes; “the deadliest snake in India. He has died within ten seconds of being bitten. Violence does, in truth, recoil upon the violent, and the schemer falls into the pit which he digs for another. Let us thrust this creature back into its den, and we can then remove Miss Stoner to some place of shelter and let the county police know what has happened.”\nAs he spoke he drew the dog-whip swiftly from the dead man’s lap, and throwing the noose round the reptile’s neck he drew it from its horrid perch and, carrying it at arm’s length, threw it into the iron safe, which he closed upon it.\nSuch are the true facts of the death of Dr. Grimesby Roylott, of Stoke Moran. It is not necessary that I should prolong a narrative which has already run to too great a length by telling how we broke the sad news to the terrified girl, how we conveyed her by the morning train to the care of her good aunt at Harrow, of how the slow process of official inquiry came to the conclusion that the doctor met his fate while indiscreetly playing with a dangerous pet. The little which I had yet to learn of the case was told me by Sherlock Holmes as we travelled back next day.\n“I had,” said he, “come to an entirely erroneous conclusion which shows, my dear Watson, how dangerous it always is to reason from insufficient data. The presence of the gipsies, and the use of the word ‘band,’ which was used by the poor girl, no doubt, to explain the appearance which she had caught a hurried glimpse of by the light of her match, were sufficient to put me upon an entirely wrong scent. I can only claim the merit that I instantly reconsidered my position when, however, it became clear to me that whatever danger threatened an occupant of the room could not come either from the window or the door. My attention was speedily drawn, as I have already remarked to you, to this ventilator, and to the bell-rope which hung down to the bed. The discovery that this was a dummy, and that the bed was clamped to the floor, instantly gave rise to the suspicion that the rope was there as a bridge for something passing through the hole and coming to the bed. The idea of a snake instantly occurred to me, and when I coupled it with my knowledge that the doctor was furnished with a supply of creatures from India, I felt that I was probably on the right track. The idea of using a form of poison which could not possibly be discovered by any chemical test was just such a one as would occur to a clever and ruthless man who had had an Eastern training. The rapidity with which such a poison would take effect would also, from his point of view, be an advantage. It would be a sharp-eyed coroner, indeed, who could distinguish the two little dark punctures which would show where the poison fangs had done their work. Then I thought of the whistle. Of course he must recall the snake before the morning light revealed it to the victim. He had trained it, probably by the use of the milk which we saw, to return to him when summoned. He would put it through this ventilator at the hour that he thought best, with the certainty that it would crawl down the rope and land on the bed. It might or might not bite the occupant, perhaps she might escape every night for a week, but sooner or later she must fall a victim.\n“I had come to these conclusions before ever I had entered his room. An inspection of his chair showed me that he had been in the habit of standing on it, which of course would be necessary in order that he should reach the ventilator. The sight of the safe, the saucer of milk, and the loop of whipcord were enough to finally dispel any doubts which may have remained. The metallic clang heard by Miss Stoner was obviously caused by her stepfather hastily closing the door of his safe upon its terrible occupant. Having once made up my mind, you know the steps which I took in order to put the matter to the proof. I heard the creature hiss as I have no doubt that you did also, and I instantly lit the light and attacked it.”\n“With the result of driving it through the ventilator.”\n“And also with the result of causing it to turn upon its master at the other side. Some of the blows of my cane came home and roused its snakish temper, so that it flew upon the first person it saw. In this way I am no doubt indirectly responsible for Dr. Grimesby Roylott’s death, and I cannot say that it is likely to weigh very heavily upon my conscience.”",

The night had settled with a profound stillness, broken only by the occasional rustle of leaves stirred by a gentle breeze. Sherlock Holmes and I stood silently on the edge of the moor, our eyes fixed on the shadowy outline of the grand estate. The case that had brought us here was as perplexing as it was sinister, and the darkness seemed to mirror the mystery that enveloped the manor.\n\nEarlier that evening, we had received a letter from Lady Margaret, the lady of the house, imploring us to investigate a series of strange occurrences that had unsettled the household. Servants whispered of ghostly apparitions and unexplained noises, while valuable items had inexplicably vanished. The local constabulary had been baffled, and it was clear that only Holmes’s keen intellect could unravel the truth.\n\nAs we approached the manor, the heavy oak doors creaked open, revealing a dimly lit hallway adorned with ancestral portraits whose eyes seemed to follow our every move. Lady Margaret greeted us with a mixture of relief and apprehension, her pale face framed by a cascade of dark curls. She led us to the drawing-room, where the family and a few close acquaintances had gathered, their faces etched with worry.\n\nHolmes’s gaze swept the room, taking in every detail—the flickering candlelight casting elongated shadows, the intricate patterns of the Persian rug, and the subtle tension that hung in the air. He began his inquiries with a calm and measured tone, asking each person to recount their experiences and observations. The accounts varied, but a common thread emerged: a mysterious figure clad in black had been seen lurking near the estate grounds on several occasions.\n\nIntrigued, Holmes requested to examine the areas where these sightings had occurred. We ventured into the garden, now cloaked in darkness, the moon casting a silvery glow upon the dew-kissed foliage. Holmes’s sharp eyes detected faint footprints leading towards the ancient oak tree at the far end. Kneeling, he examined the impressions, noting their size and depth.\n\n\"These prints are recent,\" he murmured, \"and they suggest a person of considerable weight. Moreover, the stride indicates haste, perhaps fear or urgency.\"\n\nWe followed the trail, which led us to a concealed entrance beneath the tree’s gnarled roots. Holmes produced a small lantern and descended into the hidden passage, beckoning me to follow. The air was damp and musty, and the narrow corridor twisted and turned, eventually opening into a subterranean chamber.\n\nInside, we found evidence of clandestine meetings—discarded papers, a smoldering candle, and a map of the estate marked with cryptic symbols. Holmes’s eyes gleamed with excitement as he pieced together the puzzle. \"This is no mere haunting,\" he declared. \"We are dealing with a calculated scheme, designed to instill fear and divert attention.\"\n\nReturning to the manor, Holmes convened the household, revealing his deductions. The mysterious figure was a ruse, orchestrated by someone within the family to conceal illicit activities. The missing items were part of a larger plan to embezzle funds and manipulate inheritance.\n\nConfronted with the evidence, the culprit confessed, and justice was swiftly served. The manor’s tranquility was restored, and Lady Margaret expressed her profound gratitude. As we departed, Holmes reflected on the case, remarking, \"It is often in the shadows of fear that the truth hides, waiting for the light of reason to expose it.\"\n\nThe night air was crisp as we made our way back across the moor, the first light of dawn breaking over the horizon. The adventure had tested our resolve and intellect, reaffirming the enduring power of observation and deduction in the face of mystery."

Colonel Warburton, a man of high military reputation and considerable wealth, had for some time been exhibiting signs of mental disturbance, which culminated in a series of violent outbursts and erratic behavior. His family, alarmed by these developments, sought Holmes's assistance in uncovering the cause of the colonel's sudden descent into madness. Through careful observation and deduction, Holmes was able to trace the root of the problem to a long-buried secret from the colonel's past, involving betrayal and guilt that had haunted him for years. The resolution of the case not only restored the colonel's sanity but also brought peace to his troubled household."

I had returned to civil practice and had finally abandoned Holmes in his Baker Street rooms, although I continually visited him and occasionally even persuaded him to forgo his Bohemian habits so far as to come and visit us. My practice had steadily increased, and as I happened to live at no very great distance from Paddington Station, I got a few patients from among the officials. One of these, whom I had cured of a painful and lingering disease, was never weary of advertising my virtues and of endeavouring to send me on every sufferer over whom he might have any influence.\nOne morning, at a little before seven o’clock, I was awakened by the maid tapping at the door to announce that two men had come from Paddington and were waiting in the consulting-room. I dressed hurriedly, for I knew by experience that railway cases were seldom trivial, and hastened downstairs. As I descended, my old ally, the guard, came out of the room and closed the door tightly behind him.\n“I’ve got him here,” he whispered, jerking his thumb over his shoulder; “he’s all right.”\n“What is it, then?” I asked, for his manner suggested that it was some strange creature which he had caged up in my room.\n“It’s a new patient,” he whispered. “I thought I’d bring him round myself; then he couldn’t slip away. There he is, all safe and sound. I must go now, Doctor; I have my dooties, just the same as you.” And off he went, this trusty tout, without even giving me time to thank him.\nI entered my consulting-room and found a gentleman seated by the table. He was quietly dressed in a suit of heather tweed with a soft cloth cap which he had laid down upon my books. Round one of his hands he had a handkerchief wrapped, which was mottled all over with bloodstains. He was young, not more than five-and-twenty, I should say, with a strong, masculine face; but he was exceedingly pale and gave me the impression of a man who was suffering from some strong agitation, which it took all his strength of mind to control.\n“I am sorry to knock you up so early, Doctor,” said he, “but I have had a very serious accident during the night. I came in by train this morning, and on inquiring at Paddington as to where I might find a doctor, a worthy fellow very kindly escorted me here. I gave the maid a card, but I see that she has left it upon the side-table.”\nI took it up and glanced at it. “Mr. Victor Hatherley, hydraulic engineer, 16A, Victoria Street (3rd floor).” That was the name, style, and abode of my morning visitor. “I regret that I have kept you waiting,” said I, sitting down in my library-chair. “You are fresh from a night journey, I understand, which is in itself a monotonous occupation.”\n“Oh, my night could not be called monotonous,” said he, and laughed. He laughed very heartily, with a high, ringing note, leaning back in his chair and shaking his sides. All my medical instincts rose up against that laugh.",

MAJOR STRUCTURAL ISSUES:\n- The completion omits the narrator’s explicit mention of having abandoned Holmes in his Baker Street rooms, and instead incorrectly states that he was still living there and had not given up his police connection. This introduces invented details and misses a key transition in the narrator’s life.\n- The completion does not include the narrator’s ongoing visits to Holmes or the occasional persuasion to have Holmes visit him, which is a significant relational detail in the original.\n\n2. MISSING ELEMENTS:\n- The completion leaves out the description of the narrator’s steadily increasing practice and the specific mention of receiving patients from among Paddington officials, as well as the detail about one grateful patient’s efforts to recommend him to others.\n- The original’s description of the guard as a “trusty tout” and the guard’s dialogue about his duties are condensed, losing some nuance and characterization.\n- The completion omits the narrator’s observation of the patient’s strong agitation and the effort it took for him to control it, which is important for setting the patient’s emotional state.\n- The detail about the maid leaving the card on the side-table is missing, as is the narrator’s action of picking it up and reading it aloud.\n\n3. INACCURATE ELEMENTS:\n- Early in the passage, the completion inaccurately states the narrator is still living in Baker Street and maintains a police connection, which does not align with the original’s timeline or focus.\n- The sequence of events is slightly altered: the completion compresses the guard’s actions and dialogue, omitting the guard’s mannerisms and the narrator’s reaction.\n- The completion attributes the patient’s introduction and explanation in a more direct and condensed manner, missing the original’s subtler exchange and the narrator’s internal reactions.\n- The patient’s laughter is described as “uncontrollable, hearty laughter,” which exaggerates the original’s depiction and alters the narrator’s response to it.\n\nTo improve, ensure the narrator’s living situation and relationship with Holmes are accurately reflected, restore missing relational and emotional details, and maintain the original sequence and nuance of interactions."

            "prefix-probing": "It was in the summer of ’89, not long after my marriage, that the events occurred which I am now about to summarise. I had returned to London after a brief stay in the country, eager to resume my work and the familiar routine of the city. The days were long and warm, and the streets buzzed with the usual mixture of commerce and gossip. It was during this period that I received a visit from my old friend, Sherlock Holmes, whose keen intellect and unerring powers of observation had often been the source of my admiration and assistance.\n\nHolmes was in his usual state of restless energy, pacing the room of our shared lodgings at 221B Baker Street. He had just come from a consultation with a client whose case promised to be both intriguing and complex. As he recounted the details, I listened intently, noting the subtle clues that only he seemed to perceive.\n\nThe client, a young woman of considerable beauty and grace, had come to Holmes with a tale of mystery and distress. She spoke of a series of strange occurrences at her family estate, a grand manor nestled in the countryside. Objects had been moved, letters intercepted, and an atmosphere of unease had settled over the household. The lady feared that some hidden threat was at work, one that might endanger her family’s reputation and safety.\n\nHolmes, ever the master of deduction, immediately set about gathering information. We traveled together to the estate, where the summer sun cast long shadows over the manicured lawns and ancient oaks. The household staff were polite but reserved, and the family members seemed burdened by secrets they dared not share.\n\nOver the course of several days, Holmes conducted his investigations with meticulous care. He examined the grounds, questioned the servants, and scrutinized the correspondence that had been intercepted. His sharp eyes missed nothing, and his mind pieced together fragments of evidence that to others seemed unrelated.\n\nOne evening, as the sun dipped below the horizon, casting a golden glow over the estate, Holmes gathered the family and staff in the drawing-room. With characteristic flair, he revealed the truth behind the mysterious events. It was a tale of jealousy, greed, and long-buried grudges, woven into a plot to discredit the family and seize their fortune.\n\nThe culprit, a trusted member of the household, had orchestrated the disturbances to create an atmosphere of fear and suspicion. Holmes’s revelation brought relief and gratitude to the family, and justice was swiftly served.\n\nAs we departed the estate, I reflected on the remarkable powers of my friend. His ability to see beyond the surface, to unravel the tangled threads of human motives and actions, was nothing short of extraordinary. The summer of ’89 had brought with it a case that tested his skills and reaffirmed his place as the greatest detective of our time.\n\nReturning to London, Holmes and I resumed our usual pursuits, but the memory of that summer lingered. It was a reminder of the shadows that lurk beneath the veneer of respectability, and of the light that reason and observation can cast upon the darkest mysteries."

The wound was a ghastly one. The thumb had been cut off close to the hand, and the flesh was torn and ragged. The red, spongy surface was exposed, and the blood had clotted in the wound. \"Good heavens!\" I exclaimed. \"This must have bled terribly.\" \"I fainted,\" he said, \"and when I came to, I tore off my handkerchief and bound it tightly round my wrist. I found a twig and used it as a tourniquet. I am a hydraulic engineer, and I suppose that knowledge helped me to stop the bleeding.\" I examined the wound carefully. \"This must have been done with a heavy, sharp instrument,\" I said. \"A cleaver, perhaps?\" \"Yes,\" he answered. \"It was no accident. It was a very murderous attack.\" I was horrified. I cleaned and dressed the wound as best I could, while he bore the pain with a grim patience.",

Holmes took it eagerly, and the color came back to his cheeks. “I am better now,” he said, “and I thank you. But the matter is urgent, and I must not lose a moment.”\n\nHe rose and began to pace the room, his keen eyes flashing with renewed energy. “Watson,” he said, “this case is unlike any we have encountered before. The clues are subtle, but they point to a conspiracy of the highest order.”\n\nI listened intently as he outlined the details: a missing heirloom, a secret society, and a trail of cryptic messages left at the scene of the crime. “The game is afoot,” he declared, “and we must be swift if we are to prevent a tragedy.”\n\nWe gathered our coats and hats, and I could see the determination in Holmes’s face. “Come, Watson,” he said, “the night is dark, but our purpose is clear.”\n\nAs we stepped into the foggy streets of London, I felt a thrill of anticipation. The city was alive with mystery, and I knew that with Holmes by my side, no secret would remain hidden for long. Together, we would unravel the tangled web of deceit and bring the culprits to justice.\n\nThe adventure had begun, and I was ready to follow wherever it might lead."

            "prefix-probing": "“How is that?” I asked when I had finished.\n\n“Why, it is quite simple,” said Holmes, with a smile. “You see, the man who wrote this letter is evidently a person of some education and refinement, yet he has made a mistake which betrays his true character. The phrase ‘I am your devoted servant’ is a common closing, but the way it is written here, with a certain awkwardness, suggests that the writer is not accustomed to such formalities. Moreover, the ink used is of a peculiar shade, and the paper is of a quality not often found in ordinary correspondence.”\n\nI looked at the letter again, noting the points Holmes had mentioned. “But what does this tell us about the writer?” I inquired.\n\nHolmes tapped his fingers thoughtfully. “It tells us that the writer is likely someone who wishes to appear more genteel than he truly is. Perhaps a man who has recently risen in social standing or who is attempting to conceal his origins. The peculiar ink and paper suggest that he procured his materials from a specific source, which we might be able to trace.”\n\n“Fascinating,” I said. “And what of the content of the letter itself?”\n\nHolmes’s eyes gleamed. “Ah, therein lies the key. The letter speaks of a meeting at a certain time and place, but the language is deliberately vague, as if to avoid detection. The writer is cautious, yet eager. This combination of traits is typical of someone involved in clandestine activities.”\n\nI nodded slowly, beginning to see the picture Holmes was painting. “So, by analyzing the letter, we can deduce much about the writer’s identity and intentions.”\n\n“Precisely,” said Holmes. “Every detail, no matter how small, is a clue waiting to be uncovered.”"

          "text_segment": "“You must know,” said he, “that I am an orphan and a bachelor, residing alone in lodgings in London. By profession I am a hydraulic engineer, and I have had considerable experience of my work during the seven years that I was apprenticed to Venner & Matheson, the well-known firm, of Greenwich. Two years ago, having served my time, and having also come into a fair sum of money through my poor father’s death, I determined to start in business for myself and took professional chambers in Victoria Street.\n“I suppose that everyone finds his first independent start in business a dreary experience. To me it has been exceptionally so. During two years I have had three consultations and one small job, and that is absolutely all that my profession has brought me. My gross takings amount to £ 27 10s. Every day, from nine in the morning until four in the afternoon, I waited in my little den, until at last my heart began to sink, and I came to believe that I should never have any practice at all.\n“Yesterday, however, just as I was thinking of leaving the office, my clerk entered to say there was a gentleman waiting who wished to see me upon business. He brought up a card, too, with the name of ‘Colonel Lysander Stark’ engraved upon it. Close at his heels came the colonel himself, a man rather over the middle size, but of an exceeding thinness. I do not think that I have ever seen so thin a man. His whole face sharpened away into nose and chin, and the skin of his cheeks was drawn quite tense over his outstanding bones. Yet this emaciation seemed to be his natural habit, and due to no disease, for his eye was bright, his step brisk, and his bearing assured. He was plainly but neatly dressed, and his age, I should judge, would be nearer forty than thirty.\n“‘Mr. Hatherley?’ said he, with something of a German accent. ‘You have been recommended to me, Mr. Hatherley, as being a man who is not only proficient in his profession but is also discreet and capable of preserving a secret.’\n“I bowed, feeling as flattered as any young man would at such an address. ‘May I ask who it was who gave me so good a character?’\n“‘Well, perhaps it is better that I should not tell you that just at this moment. I have it from the same source that you are both an orphan and a bachelor and are residing alone in London.’\n“‘That is quite correct,’ I answered; ‘but you will excuse me if I say that I cannot see how all this bears upon my professional qualifications. I understand that it was on a professional matter that you wished to speak to me?’\n“‘Undoubtedly so. But you will find that all I say is really to the point. I have a professional commission for you, but absolute secrecy is quite essential—absolute secrecy, you understand, and of course we may expect that more from a man who is alone than from one who lives in the bosom of his family.’\n“‘If I promise to keep a secret,’ said I, ‘you may absolutely depend upon my doing so.’\n“He looked very hard at me as I spoke, and it seemed to me that I had never seen so suspicious and questioning an eye.\n“‘Do you promise, then?’ said he at last.\n“‘Yes, I promise.’\n“‘Absolute and complete silence before, during, and after? No reference to the matter at all, either in word or writing?’\n“‘I have already given you my word.’\n“‘Very good.’ He suddenly sprang up, and darting like lightning across the room he flung open the door. The passage outside was empty.\n“‘That’s all right,’ said he, coming back. ‘I know that clerks are sometimes curious as to their master’s affairs. Now we can talk in safety.’ He drew up his chair very close to mine and began to stare at me again with the same questioning and thoughtful look.\n“A feeling of repulsion, and of something akin to fear had begun to rise within me at the strange antics of this fleshless man. Even my dread of losing a client could not restrain me from showing my impatience.\n“‘I beg that you will state your business, sir,’ said I; ‘my time is of value.’ Heaven forgive me for that last sentence, but the words came to my lips.\n“‘How would fifty guineas for a night’s work suit you?’ he asked.\n“‘Most admirably.’\n“‘I say a night’s work, but an hour’s would be nearer the mark. I simply want your opinion about a hydraulic stamping machine which has got out of gear. If you show us what is wrong we shall soon set it right ourselves. What do you think of such a commission as that?’\n“‘The work appears to be light and the pay munificent.’\n“‘Precisely so. We shall want you to come to-night by the last train.’\n“‘Where to?’\n“‘To Eyford, in Berkshire. It is a little place near the borders of Oxfordshire, and within seven miles of Reading. There is a train from Paddington which would bring you there at about 11:15.’\n“‘Very good.’\n“‘I shall come down in a carriage to meet you.’\n“‘There is a drive, then?’\n“‘Yes, our little place is quite out in the country. It is a good seven miles from Eyford Station.’\n“‘Then we can hardly get there before midnight. I suppose there would be no chance of a train back. I should be compelled to stop the night.’\n“‘Yes, we could easily give you a shake-down.’\n“‘That is very awkward. Could I not come at some more convenient hour?’\n“‘We have judged it best that you should come late. It is to recompense you for any inconvenience that we are paying to you, a young and unknown man, a fee which would buy an opinion from the very heads of your profession. Still, of course, if you would like to draw out of the business, there is plenty of time to do so.’\n“I thought of the fifty guineas, and of how very useful they would be to me. ‘Not at all,’ said I, ‘I shall be very happy to accommodate myself to your wishes. I should like, however, to understand a little more clearly what it is that you wish me to do.’\n“‘Quite so. It is very natural that the pledge of secrecy which we have exacted from you should have aroused your curiosity. I have no wish to commit you to anything without your having it all laid before you. I suppose that we are absolutely safe from eavesdroppers?’\n“‘Entirely.’\n“‘Then the matter stands thus. You are probably aware that fuller’s-earth is a valuable product, and that it is only found in one or two places in England?’\n“‘I have heard so.’\n“‘Some little time ago I bought a small place—a very small place—within ten miles of Reading. I was fortunate enough to discover that there was a deposit of fuller’s-earth in one of my fields. On examining it, however, I found that this deposit was a comparatively small one, and that it formed a link between two very much larger ones upon the right and left—both of them, however, in the grounds of my neighbours. These good people were absolutely ignorant that their land contained that which was quite as valuable as a gold-mine. Naturally, it was to my interest to buy their land before they discovered its true value, but unfortunately I had no capital by which I could do this. I took a few of my friends into the secret, however, and they suggested that we should quietly and secretly work our own little deposit and that in this way we should earn the money which would enable us to buy the neighbouring fields. This we have now been doing for some time, and in order to help us in our operations we erected a hydraulic press. This press, as I have already explained, has got out of order, and we wish your advice upon the subject. We guard our secret very jealously, however, and if it once became known that we had hydraulic engineers coming to our little house, it would soon rouse inquiry, and then, if the facts came out, it would be good-bye to any chance of getting these fields and carrying out our plans. That is why I have made you promise me that you will not tell a human being that you are going to Eyford to-night. I hope that I make it all plain?’\n“‘I quite follow you,’ said I. ‘The only point which I could not quite understand was what use you could make of a hydraulic press in excavating fuller’s-earth, which, as I understand, is dug out like gravel from a pit.’\n“‘Ah!’ said he carelessly, ‘we have our own process. We compress the earth into bricks, so as to remove them without revealing what they are. But that is a mere detail. I have taken you fully into my confidence now, Mr. Hatherley, and I have shown you how I trust you.’ He rose as he spoke. ‘I shall expect you, then, at Eyford at 11:15.’\n“‘I shall certainly be there.’\n“‘And not a word to a soul.’ He looked at me with a last long, questioning gaze, and then, pressing my hand in a cold, dank grasp, he hurried from the room.",

            "prefix-probing": "My life has been one of quiet routine, punctuated only by the occasional adventure or mystery that has come my way. It was on one such occasion that I first encountered the remarkable Mr. Sherlock Holmes, whose keen intellect and unparalleled powers of observation have since become the stuff of legend.\n\nOur story begins on a cold and foggy evening in London, when a desperate client arrived at Holmes's Baker Street lodgings. The man, a well-dressed gentleman with a troubled expression, introduced himself as Mr. John Openshaw. He spoke of a family curse, a mysterious death, and a cryptic message that had haunted his lineage for generations.\n\nHolmes listened intently, his sharp eyes gleaming with interest. \"Tell me everything from the beginning,\" he urged.\n\nMr. Openshaw recounted the tale of the Baskerville family, whose ancestral home on the moors of Devonshire was said to be haunted by a monstrous hound. The legend spoke of a spectral beast that had claimed the lives of several family members, including Sir Charles Baskerville, whose recent death had brought the matter to a head.\n\nHolmes's mind raced as he considered the possibilities. Was this truly a supernatural occurrence, or was there a more earthly explanation lurking beneath the surface? He resolved to investigate, and I, Dr. John Watson, was to accompany him on this perilous journey.\n\nWe traveled to Devonshire, where the bleak and windswept moors stretched out before us like a vast, untamed wilderness. The Baskerville estate was a grand but somber place, its walls steeped in history and shadowed by the weight of the family curse.\n\nOur inquiries led us to a cast of intriguing characters: the loyal but secretive Barrymore servants, the enigmatic naturalist Stapleton and his sister, and the local villagers who whispered of strange sightings and eerie howls in the night.\n\nAs the days passed, the tension mounted. Strange footprints were discovered near the estate, and unsettling noises echoed across the moors. Holmes's deductions grew ever more precise, unraveling the tangled web of deceit and fear that had ensnared the Baskerville family.\n\nIn a dramatic confrontation on the desolate moor, Holmes and I faced the true villain behind the legend—a man driven by greed and madness, who had exploited the myth of the spectral hound to mask his nefarious deeds.\n\nWith the mystery solved and justice served, the Baskerville curse was lifted, and peace returned to the moorlands. Our adventure had tested our courage and intellect, but it also reaffirmed the power of reason and observation in the face of superstition and fear.\n\nReflecting on this case, I am reminded of the enduring partnership between Holmes and myself, a partnership forged in the crucible of mystery and bound by a shared commitment to truth. It is a partnership that continues to this day, as we navigate the labyrinthine streets of London and the shadowy corners of human nature, ever ready to confront the next enigma that awaits us."

Holmes immediately set to work, his keen eyes scanning every detail, his mind racing to connect the disparate clues. He examined the rooms where the master had last been seen, noting the position of furniture, the state of the windows, and the faintest traces of footprints in the garden. His deductions were swift and precise, and he shared his thoughts with me in a low voice, careful not to alarm the already distressed family.\n\nAs the days passed, the mystery deepened, with new evidence emerging that seemed to contradict previous assumptions. Yet, Holmes remained undeterred, his confidence unwavering. He employed his vast knowledge of human nature and his unparalleled powers of observation to sift through the lies and half-truths that surrounded the case. At last, in a dramatic confrontation, he revealed the culprit and the motive behind the disappearance, bringing relief and closure to all involved.

The country roads seem to be not very good in that part of the world, for we lurched and jolted terribly. I tried to look out of the windows to see something of where we were, but they were made of frosted glass, and I could make out nothing save the occasional bright blur of a passing light.

At last, however, the bumping of the road was exchanged for the crisp smoothness of a gravel-drive, and the carriage came to a stand. Colonel Lysander Stark sprang out, and, as I followed after him, pulled me swiftly into a porch which gaped in front of us. We stepped, as it were, right out of the carriage and into the hall, so that I failed to catch the most fleeting glance of the front of the house. The instant that I had crossed the threshold the door slammed heavily behind us, and I heard faintly the rattle of the wheels as the carriage drove away.\n“It was pitch dark inside the house, and the colonel fumbled about looking for matches and muttering under his breath. Suddenly a door opened at the other end of the passage, and a long, golden bar of light shot out in our direction. It grew broader, and a woman appeared with a lamp in her hand, which she held above her head, pushing her face forward and peering at us. I could see that she was pretty, and from the gloss with which the light shone upon her dark dress I knew that it was a rich material. She spoke a few words in a foreign tongue in a tone as though asking a question, and when my companion answered in a gruff monosyllable she gave such a start that the lamp nearly fell from her hand. Colonel Stark went up to her, whispered something in her ear, and then, pushing her back into the room from whence she had come, he walked towards me again with the lamp in his hand.\n“‘Perhaps you will have the kindness to wait in this room for a few minutes,’ said he, throwing open another door. It was a quiet, little, plainly furnished room, with a round table in the centre, on which several German books were scattered. Colonel Stark laid down the lamp on the top of a harmonium beside the door. ‘I shall not keep you waiting an instant,’ said he, and vanished into the darkness.",

The road was rough and uneven, winding through dense woods and over rolling hills, which made our progress slow and arduous. The sun was beginning to dip below the horizon, casting long shadows that danced among the trees, and a chill wind whispered through the branches, carrying with it the scent of damp earth and pine.\n\nAs we rode, I could not help but feel a growing sense of unease. The Colonel, usually so confident and unflappable, was unusually silent, his eyes fixed intently on the path ahead. I glanced at him, but he gave no sign of acknowledgment, his jaw set firmly as if steeling himself against some unseen threat.\n\n\"Are you certain this is the right way, Colonel?\" I ventured at last.\n\nHe nodded without turning. \"Positive, Watson. The map is clear, and the landmarks match. We must press on if we are to reach the estate before nightfall.\"\n\nThe estate in question was that of Lord Blackwood, a reclusive nobleman whose recent disappearance had become the subject of much speculation in London society. The Colonel and I had been commissioned to investigate, and our journey thus far had been marked by a series of peculiar occurrences that only deepened the mystery.\n\nAs we approached a bend in the road, a sudden rustling in the underbrush caught our attention. Both of us instinctively reached for our weapons, but the source of the noise was soon revealed—a small, bedraggled dog emerged, its fur matted and eyes bright with intelligence. It trotted up to us, wagging its tail cautiously.\n\n\"Well, little fellow,\" the Colonel said, relaxing his grip on his pistol, \"it seems you have chosen to accompany us.\"\n\nThe dog seemed eager to join, and we allowed it to follow as we continued our journey. The presence of the animal brought a small measure of comfort amidst the growing darkness and the oppressive silence of the forest.\n\nFinally, after what felt like an eternity, the trees began to thin, and the outline of a grand manor house emerged against the twilight sky. The estate was imposing, its stone walls weathered by time, and the windows dark and unwelcoming.\n\nWe dismounted and approached the heavy oak door, which was slightly ajar. A cold draft greeted us as we stepped inside, and the faint scent of smoke lingered in the air. The house was eerily silent, save for the distant ticking of a grandfather clock somewhere deep within.\n\n\"Stay close, Watson,\" the Colonel whispered. \"We do not know what awaits us here.\"\n\nTogether, we ventured further into the shadowed halls, the dog padding silently at our heels, as the mystery of Lord Blackwood's disappearance began to unravel before us."

Then I walked across to the window, hoping that I might catch some glimpse of the country-side, but an oak shutter, heavily barred, was folded across it. It was a wonderfully silent house. There was an old clock ticking loudly somewhere in the passage, but otherwise everything was deadly still. A vague feeling of uneasiness began to steal over me. Who were these German people, and what were they doing living in this strange, out-of-the-way place? And where was the place? I was ten miles or so from Eyford, that was all I knew, but whether north, south, east, or west I had no idea. For that matter, Reading, and possibly other large towns, were within that radius, so the place might not be so secluded, after all. Yet it was quite certain, from the absolute stillness, that we were in the country. I paced up and down the room, humming a tune under my breath to keep up my spirits and feeling that I was thoroughly earning my fifty-guinea fee.\n“Suddenly, without any preliminary sound in the midst of the utter stillness, the door of my room swung slowly open. The woman was standing in the aperture, the darkness of the hall behind her, the yellow light from my lamp beating upon her eager and beautiful face. I could see at a glance that she was sick with fear, and the sight sent a chill to my own heart. She held up one shaking finger to warn me to be silent, and she shot a few whispered words of broken English at me, her eyes glancing back, like those of a frightened horse, into the gloom behind her.\n“‘I would go,’ said she, trying hard, as it seemed to me, to speak calmly; ‘I would go. I should not stay here. There is no good for you to do.’\n“‘But, madam,’ said I, ‘I have not yet done what I came for. I cannot possibly leave until I have seen the machine.’\n“‘It is not worth your while to wait,’ she went on. ‘You can pass through the door; no one hinders.’ And then, seeing that I smiled and shook my head, she suddenly threw aside her constraint and made a step forward, with her hands wrung together. ‘For the love of Heaven!’ she whispered, ‘get away from here before it is too late!’\n“But I am somewhat headstrong by nature, and the more ready to engage in an affair when there is some obstacle in the way. I thought of my fifty-guinea fee, of my wearisome journey, and of the unpleasant night which seemed to be before me. Was it all to go for nothing? Why should I slink away without having carried out my commission, and without the payment which was my due? This woman might, for all I knew, be a monomaniac. With a stout bearing, therefore, though her manner had shaken me more than I cared to confess, I still shook my head and declared my intention of remaining where I was. She was about to renew her entreaties when a door slammed overhead, and the sound of several footsteps was heard upon the stairs. She listened for an instant, threw up her hands with a despairing gesture, and vanished as suddenly and as noiselessly as she had come.\n“The newcomers were Colonel Lysander Stark and a short thick man with a chinchilla beard growing out of the creases of his double chin, who was introduced to me as Mr. Ferguson.\n“‘This is my secretary and manager,’ said the colonel. ‘By the way, I was under the impression that I left this door shut just now. I fear that you have felt the draught.’\n“‘On the contrary,’ said I, ‘I opened the door myself because I felt the room to be a little close.’\n“He shot one of his suspicious looks at me. ‘Perhaps we had better proceed to business, then,’ said he. ‘Mr. Ferguson and I will take you up to see the machine.’\n“‘I had better put my hat on, I suppose.’\n“‘Oh, no, it is in the house.’\n“‘What, you dig fuller’s-earth in the house?’\n“‘No, no. This is only where we compress it. But never mind that. All we wish you to do is to examine the machine and to let us know what is wrong with it.’",

Holmes, with his keen eyes, was already examining the various objects scattered about, his mind evidently piecing together the puzzle before us. I, on the other hand, was still trying to grasp the significance of the scene.\n\n\"Observe, Watson,\" Holmes said, pointing to a small, peculiar device lying near the books. \"This is no ordinary apparatus. It is a chemical instrument, used for the analysis of substances. The presence of such an item here suggests that our host is engaged in scientific experimentation.\"\n\nI nodded, still trying to take in the details.

It is not uncommon for scientists to seek solace in the arts, to balance the rigors of empirical study with the beauty of literature.\"\n\nAs we examined the room further, Holmes's attention was drawn to a small, folded piece of paper tucked beneath one of the books. He carefully unfolded it and read aloud:\n\n\"'To my dearest friend, may your quest for knowledge be ever fruitful.'\"\n\n\"A note of friendship,\" Holmes mused. \"This suggests that our host is not a recluse, but maintains connections with others in his field.\"\n\nSuddenly, a faint noise from the adjoining room caught our attention.

Professor Adler listened intently, his expression growing more serious with each word.\n\n\"I may be able to assist,\" he said finally. \"There are certain experiments I have conducted that might shed light on the matter.\"\n\nOver the next hour, we discussed the case in depth, with Professor Adler providing insights that only a man of his expertise could offer. It became clear that the solution lay not in the realm of the ordinary, but in the intricate interplay of science and human nature.\n\nAs we prepared to leave, Holmes turned to me with a satisfied smile. \"Once again, Watson, we have found that knowledge, whether gleaned from books or experience, is the key to unraveling even the most perplexing mysteries.\"\n\nI could not help but agree, feeling a renewed sense of admiration for my companion's unparalleled intellect and unwavering dedication to the pursuit of truth."

It was a labyrinth of an old house, with corridors, passages, narrow winding staircases, and little low doors, the thresholds of which were hollowed out by the generations who had crossed them. There were no carpets and no signs of any furniture above the ground floor, while the plaster was peeling off the walls, and the damp was breaking through in green, unhealthy blotches. I tried to put on as unconcerned an air as possible, but I had not forgotten the warnings of the lady, even though I disregarded them, and I kept a keen eye upon my two companions. Ferguson appeared to be a morose and silent man, but I could see from the little that he said that he was at least a fellow-countryman.\n“Colonel Lysander Stark stopped at last before a low door, which he unlocked. Within was a small, square room, in which the three of us could hardly get at one time. Ferguson remained outside, and the colonel ushered me in.\n“‘We are now,’ said he, ‘actually within the hydraulic press, and it would be a particularly unpleasant thing for us if anyone were to turn it on. The ceiling of this small chamber is really the end of the descending piston, and it comes down with the force of many tons upon this metal floor. There are small lateral columns of water outside which receive the force, and which transmit and multiply it in the manner which is familiar to you. The machine goes readily enough, but there is some stiffness in the working of it, and it has lost a little of its force. Perhaps you will have the goodness to look it over and to show us how we can set it right.’\n“I took the lamp from him, and I examined the machine very thoroughly. It was indeed a gigantic one, and capable of exercising enormous pressure. When I passed outside, however, and pressed down the levers which controlled it, I knew at once by the whishing sound that there was a slight leakage, which allowed a regurgitation of water through one of the side cylinders. An examination showed that one of the india-rubber bands which was round the head of a driving-rod had shrunk so as not quite to fill the socket along which it worked. This was clearly the cause of the loss of power, and I pointed it out to my companions, who followed my remarks very carefully and asked several practical questions as to how they should proceed to set it right. When I had made it clear to them, I returned to the main chamber of the machine and took a good look at it to satisfy my own curiosity. It was obvious at a glance that the story of the fuller’s-earth was the merest fabrication, for it would be absurd to suppose that so powerful an engine could be designed for so inadequate a purpose. The walls were of wood, but the floor consisted of a large iron trough, and when I came to examine it I could see a crust of metallic deposit all over it. I had stooped and was scraping at this to see exactly what it was when I heard a muttered exclamation in German and saw the cadaverous face of the colonel looking down at me.\n“‘What are you doing there?’ he asked.\n“I felt angry at having been tricked by so elaborate a story as that which he had told me. ‘I was admiring your fuller’s-earth,’ said I; ‘I think that I should be better able to advise you as to your machine if I knew what the exact purpose was for which it was used.’\n“The instant that I uttered the words I regretted the rashness of my speech. His face set hard, and a baleful light sprang up in his grey eyes.\n“‘Very well,’ said he, ‘you shall know all about the machine.’ He took a step backward, slammed the little door, and turned the key in the lock. I rushed towards it and pulled at the handle, but it was quite secure, and did not give in the least to my kicks and shoves.",

The corridor was dimly lit, and the silence was oppressive, broken only by the faint creaking of the floorboards beneath our feet. As we reached the door of the room where the incident had occurred, the colonel paused, his hand resting on the handle. He glanced back at us, his eyes sharp and alert.\n\n\"Are you ready?\" he asked in a low voice.\n\nWe nodded, and he slowly turned the handle, pushing the door open with a creak. The room was small and sparsely furnished, with a bed pushed against one wall and a writing desk near the window. The curtains were drawn, casting long shadows across the floor.\n\nOn the bed lay the body of a man, his face pale and eyes closed. A thin line of blood trickled from the corner of his mouth, staining the white sheets beneath him. The colonel stepped forward, examining the body with practiced eyes.\n\n\"No sign of a struggle,\" he murmured. \"This was a quiet death.\"\n\nThe fat manager moved closer, his brow furrowed. \"But who could have done this? And why?\"\n\nI looked around the room, searching for any clue that might explain the mystery. The desk was cluttered with papers, some of which were scattered on the floor. A small, ornate box sat on the windowsill, its lid slightly ajar.\n\nThe colonel approached the desk, picking up a letter from the scattered papers. He read it silently, his expression growing darker with each line.\n\n\"It seems our victim was involved in some rather dangerous affairs,\" he said finally. \"This letter suggests he was being blackmailed.\"\n\n\"Blackmailed?\" I echoed. \"By whom?\"\n\n\"That is what we must discover,\" the colonel replied. \"But first, we must examine the room more thoroughly.\"\n\nHe moved to the window, pulling back the curtain to reveal a view of the street below. The night was still, and the gas lamps cast a pale glow on the cobblestones.\n\n\"Look here,\" he said, pointing to a set of footprints in the dust on the windowsill. \"Someone entered or exited through this window recently.\"\n\nThe fat manager frowned. \"But the window is locked from the inside.\"\n\nThe colonel nodded. \"A clever ruse, no doubt. Our culprit is more cunning than we thought.\"\n\nHe turned back to the body, examining the victim's hands. \"There is a faint smell of almonds,\" he noted. \"A classic sign of cyanide poisoning.\"\n\n\"Poisoned?\" the manager exclaimed. \"But how?\"\n\n\"Likely administered in his drink or food,\" the colonel said. \"We must question the household staff and anyone who had access to this room.\"\n\nAs we left the room, the colonel's mind was already working through the possibilities. The victim's enemies, the blackmailer, the mysterious footprints—all pieces of a puzzle waiting to be solved.\n\nOver the next few hours, we interviewed the servants and neighbors, piecing together the events leading up to the death. Each testimony added a new layer to the mystery, revealing secrets and lies that had been carefully concealed.\n\nFinally, the colonel gathered us in the drawing room, his eyes gleaming with the satisfaction of a man who has unraveled a complex knot.\n\n\"The murderer is among us,\" he declared. \"And I intend to prove it.\"\n\nHe began to recount the evidence, pointing out inconsistencies and motives, until the culprit was laid bare before us all. The room was silent, save for the gasps of shock and disbelief.\n\nJustice was served that night, thanks to the keen mind and unwavering determination of the colonel. And as we parted ways, I couldn't help but marvel at the intricate dance of deduction that had brought the truth to light."

It was the clank of the levers and the swish of the leaking cylinder. He had set the engine at work. The lamp still stood upon the floor where I had placed it when examining the trough. By its light I saw that the black ceiling was coming down upon me, slowly, jerkily, but, as none knew better than myself, with a force which must within a minute grind me to a shapeless pulp. I threw myself, screaming, against the door, and dragged with my nails at the lock. I implored the colonel to let me out, but the remorseless clanking of the levers drowned my cries. The ceiling was only a foot or two above my head, and with my hand upraised I could feel its hard, rough surface. Then it flashed through my mind that the pain of my death would depend very much upon the position in which I met it. If I lay on my face the weight would come upon my spine, and I shuddered to think of that dreadful snap. Easier the other way, perhaps; and yet, had I the nerve to lie and look up at that deadly black shadow wavering down upon me? Already I was unable to stand erect, when my eye caught something which brought a gush of hope back to my heart.\n“I have said that though the floor and ceiling were of iron, the walls were of wood. As I gave a last hurried glance around, I saw a thin line of yellow light between two of the boards, which broadened and broadened as a small panel was pushed backward. For an instant I could hardly believe that here was indeed a door which led away from death. The next instant I threw myself through, and lay half-fainting upon the other side. The panel had closed again behind me, but the crash of the lamp, and a few moments afterwards the clang of the two slabs of metal, told me how narrow had been my escape.\n“I was recalled to myself by a frantic plucking at my wrist, and I found myself lying upon the stone floor of a narrow corridor, while a woman bent over me and tugged at me with her left hand, while she held a candle in her right. It was the same good friend whose warning I had so foolishly rejected.\n“‘Come! come!’ she cried breathlessly. ‘They will be here in a moment. They will see that you are not there. Oh, do not waste the so-precious time, but come!’\n“This time, at least, I did not scorn her advice. I staggered to my feet and ran with her along the corridor and down a winding stair. The latter led to another broad passage, and just as we reached it we heard the sound of running feet and the shouting of two voices, one answering the other from the floor on which we were and from the one beneath. My guide stopped and looked about her like one who is at her wit’s end. Then she threw open a door which led into a bedroom, through the window of which the moon was shining brightly.\n“‘It is your only chance,’ said she. ‘It is high, but it may be that you can jump it.’\n“As she spoke a light sprang into view at the further end of the passage, and I saw the lean figure of Colonel Lysander Stark rushing forward with a lantern in one hand and a weapon like a butcher’s cleaver in the other. I rushed across the bedroom, flung open the window, and looked out. How quiet and sweet and wholesome the garden looked in the moonlight, and it could not be more than thirty feet down. I clambered out upon the sill, but I hesitated to jump until I should have heard what passed between my saviour and the ruffian who pursued me. If she were ill-used, then at any risks I was determined to go back to her assistance. The thought had hardly flashed through my mind before he was at the door, pushing his way past her; but she threw her arms round him and tried to hold him back.\n“‘Fritz! Fritz!’ she cried in English, ‘remember your promise after the last time. You said it should not be again. He will be silent! Oh, he will be silent!’\n“‘You are mad, Elise!’ he shouted, struggling to break away from her. ‘You will be the ruin of us. He has seen too much. Let me pass, I say!’ He dashed her to one side, and, rushing to the window, cut at me with his heavy weapon. I had let myself go, and was hanging by the hands to the sill, when his blow fell. I was conscious of a dull pain, my grip loosened, and I fell into the garden below.\n“I was shaken but not hurt by the fall; so I picked myself up and rushed off among the bushes as hard as I could run, for I understood that I was far from being out of danger yet. Suddenly, however, as I ran, a deadly dizziness and sickness came over me. I glanced down at my hand, which was throbbing painfully, and then, for the first time, saw that my thumb had been cut off and that the blood was pouring from my wound. I endeavoured to tie my handkerchief round it, but there came a sudden buzzing in my ears, and next moment I fell in a dead faint among the rose-bushes.",

My clothes were all sodden with dew, and my coat-sleeve was drenched with blood from my wounded thumb. The smarting of it recalled in an instant all the particulars of my night’s adventure, and I sprang to my feet with the feeling that I might hardly yet be safe from my pursuers. But to my astonishment, when I came to look round me, neither house nor garden were to be seen. I had been lying in an angle of the hedge close by the high road, and just a little lower down was a long building, which proved, upon my approaching it, to be the very station at which I had arrived upon the previous night. Were it not for the ugly wound upon my hand, all that had passed during those dreadful hours might have been an evil dream.\n“Half dazed, I went into the station and asked about the morning train. There would be one to Reading in less than an hour. The same porter was on duty, I found, as had been there when I arrived. I inquired of him whether he had ever heard of Colonel Lysander Stark. The name was strange to him. Had he observed a carriage the night before waiting for me? No, he had not. Was there a police-station anywhere near? There was one about three miles off.\n“It was too far for me to go, weak and ill as I was. I determined to wait until I got back to town before telling my story to the police. It was a little past six when I arrived, so I went first to have my wound dressed, and then the doctor was kind enough to bring me along here. I put the case into your hands and shall do exactly what you advise.”\nWe both sat in silence for some little time after listening to this extraordinary narrative. Then Sherlock Holmes pulled down from the shelf one of the ponderous commonplace books in which he placed his cuttings.\n“Here is an advertisement which will interest you,” said he. “It appeared in all the papers about a year ago. Listen to this: ‘Lost, on the 9th inst., Mr. Jeremiah Hayling, aged twenty-six, a hydraulic engineer. Left his lodgings at ten o’clock at night, and has not been heard of since. Was dressed in,’ etc., etc. Ha! That represents the last time that the colonel needed to have his machine overhauled, I fancy.”\n“Good heavens!” cried my patient. “Then that explains what the girl said.”\n“Undoubtedly. It is quite clear that the colonel was a cool and desperate man, who was absolutely determined that nothing should stand in the way of his little game, like those out-and-out pirates who will leave no survivor from a captured ship.",

The air was thick with the scent of smoke and something faintly metallic. My head throbbed painfully, and I could feel the cold stone floor beneath me. Slowly, I tried to recall the events that had led me to this place, but my memory was a blur.\n\nAs I struggled to sit up, a shadow moved across the far corner of the room. A figure stepped forward, revealing the unmistakable silhouette of Sherlock Holmes. His keen eyes studied me intently, a mixture of relief and concern etched upon his face.\n\n\"Watson,\" he said softly, \"you gave us quite a fright.\"\n\nI attempted to speak, but my throat was dry and my voice barely a whisper. Holmes handed me a small vial of water, which I gratefully accepted. As I drank, he explained the circumstances that had led to my predicament.\n\n\"After you were attacked, I followed the trail left by our assailant. It was a perilous pursuit, but I managed to track him to this abandoned warehouse. There, I found you unconscious and bound. I freed you as quickly as I could.\"\n\nI nodded weakly, the pieces of the puzzle beginning to fit together. The case we had been working on—the mysterious disappearance of the valuable Stradivarius violin—had taken a dangerous turn. Our adversary was more cunning and ruthless than we had anticipated.\n\nHolmes continued, \"The violin was hidden here, in this very room. Our foe intended to smuggle it out under cover of darkness. Thanks to your bravery and quick thinking, we have thwarted his plans.\"\n\nDespite my injuries, a sense of satisfaction washed over me. The pursuit of justice, the unraveling of mysteries—these were the elements that defined our partnership. Together, we had faced danger and emerged victorious.\n\nAs dawn broke, the first rays of sunlight filtered through the grimy windows. The city outside was awakening, oblivious to the night's events. Holmes and I prepared to return to Baker Street, ready to document the case and prepare for the next challenge.\n\nIn the quiet moments that followed, I reflected on the resilience of the human spirit and the unyielding pursuit of truth. The adventures of Sherlock Holmes were far from over, and I was honored to stand by his side through them all."

          "text_segment": "Well, every moment now is precious, so if you feel equal to it we shall go down to Scotland Yard at once as a preliminary to starting for Eyford.”\nSome three hours or so afterwards we were all in the train together, bound from Reading to the little Berkshire village. There were Sherlock Holmes, the hydraulic engineer, Inspector Bradstreet, of Scotland Yard, a plain-clothes man, and myself. Bradstreet had spread an ordnance map of the county out upon the seat and was busy with his compasses drawing a circle with Eyford for its centre.\n“There you are,” said he. “That circle is drawn at a radius of ten miles from the village. The place we want must be somewhere near that line. You said ten miles, I think, sir.”\n“It was an hour’s good drive.”\n“And you think that they brought you back all that way when you were unconscious?”\n“They must have done so. I have a confused memory, too, of having been lifted and conveyed somewhere.”\n“What I cannot understand,” said I, “is why they should have spared you when they found you lying fainting in the garden. Perhaps the villain was softened by the woman’s entreaties.”\n“I hardly think that likely. I never saw a more inexorable face in my life.”\n“Oh, we shall soon clear up all that,” said Bradstreet. “Well, I have drawn my circle, and I only wish I knew at what point upon it the folk that we are in search of are to be found.”\n“I think I could lay my finger on it,” said Holmes quietly.\n“Really, now!” cried the inspector, “you have formed your opinion! Come, now, we shall see who agrees with you. I say it is south, for the country is more deserted there.”\n“And I say east,” said my patient.\n“I am for west,” remarked the plain-clothes man. “There are several quiet little villages up there.”\n“And I am for north,” said I, “because there are no hills there, and our friend says that he did not notice the carriage go up any.”\n“Come,” cried the inspector, laughing; “it’s a very pretty diversity of opinion. We have boxed the compass among us. Who do you give your casting vote to?”\n“You are all wrong.”\n“But we can’t all be.”\n“Oh, yes, you can. This is my point.” He placed his finger in the centre of the circle. “This is where we shall find them.”\n“But the twelve-mile drive?” gasped Hatherley.\n“Six out and six back. Nothing simpler. You say yourself that the horse was fresh and glossy when you got in. How could it be that if it had gone twelve miles over heavy roads?”\n“Indeed, it is a likely ruse enough,” observed Bradstreet thoughtfully. “Of course there can be no doubt as to the nature of this gang.”\n“None at all,” said Holmes. “They are coiners on a large scale, and have used the machine to form the amalgam which has taken the place of silver.”\n“We have known for some time that a clever gang was at work,” said the inspector. “They have been turning out half-crowns by the thousand. We even traced them as far as Reading, but could get no farther, for they had covered their traces in a way that showed that they were very old hands. But now, thanks to this lucky chance, I think that we have got them right enough.”",

The matter is of the utmost urgency, and every hour may be of importance.\"\n\nWe made our way through the bustling streets of London, the evening air crisp and filled with the distant sounds of the city winding down. At Scotland Yard, we were met by Inspector Lestrade, who greeted us with a mixture of relief and curiosity.\n\n\"Holmes,\" he said, \"we have been expecting you. The case has taken a most perplexing turn.\"\n\nHe led us to a private room where a detailed map of the Eyford area was spread out, along with various reports and witness statements. Holmes examined the documents with his usual intensity, his keen eyes scanning every detail.\n\n\"It appears,\" he mused, \"that the disappearance is not as straightforward as it first seemed. There are layers of deception and misdirection at play.\"\n\nLestrade nodded. \"Indeed. The local constabulary have been baffled. The victim vanished without a trace, and the only clue is a cryptic note left at the scene.\"\n\nHolmes took the note and read it aloud: \"The truth lies beneath the surface, where shadows dance and secrets sleep.\"\n\n\"A riddle,\" I remarked. \"But what could it signify?\"\n\n\"That is what we must discover,\" Holmes replied. \"Come, Watson, we shall set out for Eyford at first light.\"\n\nThe journey to Eyford was uneventful, but the atmosphere grew heavier as we approached the small village nestled amidst rolling hills and dense woods. The locals eyed us with suspicion, their faces etched with worry.\n\nWe were met by the village constable, a stout man named Harris, who led us to the scene of the disappearance—a quaint cottage on the outskirts of the village.\n\nInside, the air was thick with the scent of lavender and old wood. Holmes moved about the room, examining every corner with meticulous care. He paused by the fireplace, where a faint scorch mark caught his attention.\n\n\"Interesting,\" he murmured. \"This suggests a recent fire, perhaps an attempt to destroy evidence.\"\n\nHe then turned to a bookshelf, where a volume lay open, its pages marked with a peculiar symbol. \"This,\" he said, \"may be a clue to the victim's interests or associations.\"\n\nAs the day wore on, Holmes interviewed the villagers, piecing together a tapestry of relationships and motives. It became clear that beneath the village's tranquil facade lay a web of secrets and rivalries.\n\nThat evening, as we sat by the fire in the local inn, Holmes shared his thoughts. \"Watson, the key to this mystery lies not in the obvious, but in the subtle nuances—the unspoken tensions and hidden alliances.\"\n\nI nodded, eager to assist in unraveling the enigma. \"Then we must be vigilant and patient, for the truth often reveals itself in the most unexpected ways.\"\n\nHolmes smiled, his eyes gleaming with determination. \"Precisely, my dear Watson. Tomorrow, we delve deeper into the shadows of Eyford, and I have no doubt that the light of reason will soon illuminate the darkness.\"\n\nThus began our investigation into a case that would test our wits and resolve, drawing us into a labyrinth of mystery that only Sherlock Holmes could hope to navigate."

That second window is the one that I jumped from.”\n“Well, at least,” said Holmes, “you have had your revenge upon them. There can be no question that it was your oil-lamp which, when it was crushed in the press, set fire to the wooden walls, though no doubt they were too excited in the chase after you to observe it at the time.

The game was afoot, and Sherlock Holmes, with his keen intellect and unparalleled powers of observation, was already several steps ahead. It was on a foggy London evening that Holmes and I found ourselves at the scene of the crime, a modest flat in Baker Street, where the air was thick with the scent of tobacco and the faint trace of a struggle.\n\nHolmes examined every detail with meticulous care—the position of the furniture, the faint footprints on the carpet, and the peculiar scent of a rare perfume lingering in the air. \"Watson,\" he said, \"observe the peculiar angle of the broken window and the absence of any forced entry. Our criminal is no common thief but a man of cunning and precision.\"\n\nAs we delved deeper into the mystery, it became evident that the case was more complex than it initially appeared. The victim, a wealthy merchant, had enemies in high places, and the motives were tangled in a web of deceit and betrayal. Holmes's deductions led us through the labyrinthine streets of London, from the opulent drawing rooms of the aristocracy to the shadowy alleys where secrets were traded like currency.\n\nIn the end, it was Holmes's unparalleled reasoning that unraveled the truth. The criminal, confident in his anonymity, had overlooked the smallest of clues—a rare tobacco ash and a distinctive button left at the scene. With these, Holmes confronted the culprit, whose facade of innocence crumbled under the weight of evidence.\n\nJustice was served, not by chance, but by the relentless pursuit of truth. The inspector's earlier mistake was rectified, and the criminals were brought to account, their plans thwarted by the indomitable spirit of Sherlock Holmes."

He had evidently been carried down by two persons, one of whom had remarkably small feet and the other unusually large ones. On the whole, it was most probable that the silent Englishman, being less bold or less murderous than his companion, had assisted the woman to bear the unconscious man out of the way of danger.\n“Well,” said our engineer ruefully as we took our seats to return once more to London, “it has been a pretty business for me!

It began with a letter from a young woman named Violet Hunter, who sought Holmes's assistance in securing a position as a governess. She had been offered a post at a remote country estate, but the circumstances surrounding the offer were strange and unsettling. The employer, a Mr. Rucastle, was a man of violent temper and mysterious habits, and the house itself was shrouded in secrecy.\n\nHolmes agreed to take the case and accompanied Violet to the estate. There, they encountered a series of baffling events: strange noises in the night, a hidden door in the wall, and the sudden disappearance of Violet's predecessor. Holmes's keen intellect and powers of observation soon uncovered a sinister plot involving imprisonment and attempted murder.\n\nThrough careful investigation, Holmes discovered that Mr. Rucastle was holding his wife captive in a secret chamber, fearing that she would reveal his criminal past. The governess's predecessor had been locked away to prevent her from escaping and exposing the truth. With Holmes's intervention, the captive woman was rescued, and Rucastle was brought to justice.\n\nThis case, like many others, demonstrated Holmes's unparalleled skill in unraveling mysteries that baffled the ordinary mind. It also highlighted the dangers faced by those who dared to confront evil and the importance of courage and perseverance in the pursuit of truth.\n\nIn the end, Violet Hunter was able to resume her life free from fear, and the dark secrets of the estate were laid bare.

Fresh scandals have eclipsed it, and their more piquant details have drawn the gossips away from this four-year-old drama. As I have reason to believe, however, that the full facts have never been revealed to the general public, and as my friend Sherlock Holmes had a considerable share in clearing the matter up, I feel that no memoir of him would be complete without some little sketch of this remarkable episode.\nIt was a few weeks before my own marriage, during the days when I was still sharing rooms with Holmes in Baker Street, that he came home from an afternoon stroll to find a letter on the table waiting for him. I had remained indoors all day, for the weather had taken a sudden turn to rain, with high autumnal winds, and the jezail bullet which I had brought back in one of my limbs as a relic of my Afghan campaign throbbed with dull persistence. With my body in one easy-chair and my legs upon another, I had surrounded myself with a cloud of newspapers until at last, saturated with the news of the day, I tossed them all aside and lay listless, watching the huge crest and monogram upon the envelope upon the table and wondering lazily who my friend’s noble correspondent could be.\n“Here is a very fashionable epistle,” I remarked as he entered. “Your morning letters, if I remember right, were from a fish-monger and a tide-waiter.”\n“Yes, my correspondence has certainly the charm of variety,” he answered, smiling, “and the humbler are usually the more interesting. This looks like one of those unwelcome social summonses which call upon a man either to be bored or to lie.”\nHe broke the seal and glanced over the contents.\n“Oh, come, it may prove to be something of interest, after all.”\n“Not social, then?”\n“No, distinctly professional.”\n“And from a noble client?”\n“One of the highest in England.”\n“My dear fellow, I congratulate you.”\n“I assure you, Watson, without affectation, that the status of my client is a matter of less moment to me than the interest of his case. It is just possible, however, that that also may not be wanting in this new investigation. You have been reading the papers diligently of late, have you not?”\n“It looks like it,” said I ruefully, pointing to a huge bundle in the corner. “I have had nothing else to do.”\n“It is fortunate, for you will perhaps be able to post me up. I read nothing except the criminal news and the agony column. The latter is always instructive. But if you have followed recent events so closely you must have read about Lord St. Simon and his wedding?”\n“Oh, yes, with the deepest interest.”",

            "prefix-probing": "The Lord St. Simon marriage, and its curious termination, have long ceased to be a subject of interest in those exalted circles in which the unfortunate bridegroom moves. Yet, the story remains a singular one, marked by a series of events that could have been lifted from the pages of a novel rather than the annals of real life. It was a union that promised much but delivered little, culminating in a mystery that even the keenest minds found perplexing.\n\nLord St. Simon, a man of considerable wealth and social standing, had been known for his charm and wit. His marriage to Lady Eleanor, a woman of equal grace and beauty, was celebrated with great fanfare. The society papers were filled with accounts of the lavish ceremony, the splendid attire, and the notable guests who graced the occasion. Yet, beneath the surface of this glittering facade lay tensions and secrets that would soon unravel.\n\nThe early days of their marriage were marked by happiness and mutual affection. They were often seen together at social gatherings, their smiles genuine and their companionship evident. However, as time passed, whispers began to circulate about disagreements and estrangement. Lady Eleanor was said to have withdrawn from public life, while Lord St. Simon's demeanor grew increasingly somber.\n\nThe turning point came with Lady Eleanor's sudden disappearance. One evening, she left their residence under the pretense of visiting a friend and was never seen again. The household was thrown into chaos, and the police were called to investigate. Despite exhaustive searches and inquiries, no trace of Lady Eleanor was found. The case baffled the authorities and became a topic of widespread speculation.\n\nIn the midst of this turmoil, Sherlock Holmes was consulted. His reputation for solving the most intricate mysteries was well known, and Lord St. Simon sought his assistance in uncovering the truth behind his wife's vanishing. Holmes approached the case with his characteristic methodical precision, examining the evidence and interviewing those connected to Lady Eleanor.\n\nHolmes discovered that beneath the veneer of the perfect marriage lay a web of deceit and hidden motives. Lady Eleanor had been involved in clandestine activities, and her disappearance was not as straightforward as it seemed. Through careful deduction, Holmes pieced together the sequence of events leading to her departure, revealing a tale of betrayal, desperation, and ultimately, liberation.\n\nThe resolution of the case brought relief to Lord St. Simon and restored a measure of peace to the troubled household. It also served as a reminder that appearances can be deceiving, and that even the most seemingly idyllic unions may conceal dark secrets. The story of the Lord St. Simon marriage remains a testament to the complexities of human relationships and the enduring quest for truth."

I will read it to you, and in return you must turn over these papers and let me have whatever bears upon the matter. This is what he says:\n“‘MY DEAR MR. SHERLOCK HOLMES,—Lord Backwater tells me that I may place implicit reliance upon your judgment and discretion. I have determined, therefore, to call upon you and to consult you in reference to the very painful event which has occurred in connection with my wedding. Mr. Lestrade, of Scotland Yard, is acting already in the matter, but he assures me that he sees no objection to your co-operation, and that he even thinks that it might be of some assistance. I will call at four o’clock in the afternoon, and, should you have any other engagement at that time, I hope that you will postpone it, as this matter is of paramount importance. Yours faithfully,\n“‘ROBERT ST. SIMON.’\n“It is dated from Grosvenor Mansions, written with a quill pen, and the noble lord has had the misfortune to get a smear of ink upon the outer side of his right little finger,” remarked Holmes as he folded up the epistle.\n“He says four o’clock. It is three now. He will be here in an hour.”\n“Then I have just time, with your assistance, to get clear upon the subject. Turn over those papers and arrange the extracts in their order of time, while I take a glance as to who our client is.” He picked a red-covered volume from a line of books of reference beside the mantelpiece. “Here he is,” said he, sitting down and flattening it out upon his knee. “‘Lord Robert Walsingham de Vere St. Simon, second son of the Duke of Balmoral.’ Hum! ‘Arms: Azure, three caltrops in chief over a fess sable. Born in 1846.’ He’s forty-one years of age, which is mature for marriage. Was Under-Secretary for the colonies in a late administration. The Duke, his father, was at one time Secretary for Foreign Affairs. They inherit Plantagenet blood by direct descent, and Tudor on the distaff side. Ha! Well, there is nothing very instructive in all this. I think that I must turn to you Watson, for something more solid.”\n“I have very little difficulty in finding what I want,” said I, “for the facts are quite recent, and the matter struck me as remarkable. I feared to refer them to you, however, as I knew that you had an inquiry on hand and that you disliked the intrusion of other matters.”\n“Oh, you mean the little problem of the Grosvenor Square furniture van. That is quite cleared up now—though, indeed, it was obvious from the first. Pray give me the results of your newspaper selections.”\n“Here is the first notice which I can find. It is in the personal column of the Morning Post, and dates, as you see, some weeks back: ‘A marriage has been arranged,’ it says, ‘and will, if rumour is correct, very shortly take place, between Lord Robert St. Simon, second son of the Duke of Balmoral, and Miss Hatty Doran, the only daughter of Aloysius Doran. Esq., of San Francisco, Cal., U.S.A.’ That is all.”\n“Terse and to the point,” remarked Holmes, stretching his long, thin legs towards the fire.\n“There was a paragraph amplifying this in one of the society papers of the same week. Ah, here it is: ‘There will soon be a call for protection in the marriage market, for the present free-trade principle appears to tell heavily against our home product. One by one the management of the noble houses of Great Britain is passing into the hands of our fair cousins from across the Atlantic. An important addition has been made during the last week to the list of the prizes which have been borne away by these charming invaders. Lord St. Simon, who has shown himself for over twenty years proof against the little god’s arrows, has now definitely announced his approaching marriage with Miss Hatty Doran, the fascinating daughter of a California millionaire. Miss Doran, whose graceful figure and striking face attracted much attention at the Westbury House festivities, is an only child, and it is currently reported that her dowry will run to considerably over the six figures, with expectancies for the future. As it is an open secret that the Duke of Balmoral has been compelled to sell his pictures within the last few years, and as Lord St. Simon has no property of his own save the small estate of Birchmoor, it is obvious that the Californian heiress is not the only gainer by an alliance which will enable her to make the easy and common transition from a Republican lady to a British peeress.’”\n“Anything else?” asked Holmes, yawning.\n“Oh, yes; plenty. Then there is another note in the Morning Post to say that the marriage would be an absolutely quiet one, that it would be at St. George’s, Hanover Square, that only half a dozen intimate friends would be invited, and that the party would return to the furnished house at Lancaster Gate which has been taken by Mr. Aloysius Doran. Two days later—that is, on Wednesday last—there is a curt announcement that the wedding had taken place, and that the honeymoon would be passed at Lord Backwater’s place, near Petersfield. Those are all the notices which appeared before the disappearance of the bride.”\n“Before the what?” asked Holmes with a start.\n“The vanishing of the lady.”\n“When did she vanish, then?”\n“At the wedding breakfast.”\n“Indeed. This is more interesting than it promised to be; quite dramatic, in fact.”\n“Yes; it struck me as being a little out of the common.”\n“They often vanish before the ceremony, and occasionally during the honeymoon; but I cannot call to mind anything quite so prompt as this. Pray let me have the details.”",

MISSING ELEMENTS:\n- The initial instruction from Holmes to Watson regarding sorting and arranging the papers by chronological order is missing.\n- The specific details about the letter’s physical characteristics and Holmes’s observations about the ink smear on Lord St. Simon’s finger are only partially included; the completion lacks the full context and Holmes’s reasoning.\n- The detailed genealogical and heraldic information about Lord St. Simon, including his lineage, titles, and family history, is abbreviated and some categories (such as arms and bloodlines) are omitted.\n- The original’s commentary on the social implications of the marriage, as well as the financial context and the mention of the sale of family pictures, is only briefly referenced and lacks the nuance and detail of the original.\n- The completion omits the original’s mention of the number of guests, the specific location of the wedding, and the arrangement for the return to the furnished house at Lancaster Gate.\n- The sequence of newspaper notices and Holmes’s reactions to each are compressed, losing the progression and Holmes’s evaluative remarks.\n- The original’s discussion of the timing of the disappearance (\"before the disappearance of the bride\") and Holmes’s surprise at the promptness of the vanishing are not fully developed.\n\n3. INACCURATE ELEMENTS:\n- The completion gives an incorrect age and title for Lord St. Simon, and misattributes his parentage and government position, which do not match the original’s details.\n- The order of events is altered: the completion presents Watson’s return with newspaper clippings as a single event, rather than as a process interspersed with Holmes’s commentary.\n- The completion introduces a more passive role for Watson, whereas in the original, Watson is actively involved in presenting and discussing the evidence.\n- The completion omits Holmes’s reference to a previously solved case (the Grosvenor Square furniture van), which is part of the original’s sequence.\n- The completion summarizes the social commentary from the society paper rather than presenting the progression of notices and their content as in the original.\n- The completion does not include Holmes’s request for further details at the end, which is present in the original passage."

The flickering candlelight cast long shadows across the room, adding an air of mystery to our late-night consultation. \"The game is afoot, and every detail counts.\"\n\nI leaned closer, studying the map that marked the locations of recent peculiar events across London. Holmes tapped a finger on a spot near the docks. \"Here, at the old warehouse, is where the trail begins. The disappearance of Mr. Blackwood was no mere coincidence.\"\n\nHolmes’s mind raced through the possibilities, piecing together clues that seemed unrelated at first glance. \"Notice the pattern, Watson. Each incident aligns with the phases of the moon, suggesting a calculated plan by our adversary.\"\n\nI nodded, impressed by Holmes’s deductive prowess. \"But what motive could drive such a scheme?\"\n\nHolmes smiled faintly. \"That, my dear Watson, is what we must uncover. The devil is in the details, and I believe the answer lies within the cryptic messages left at each scene.\"\n\nWe spent hours poring over the evidence, Holmes’s keen intellect unraveling the threads of a complex conspiracy. As dawn approached, a breakthrough emerged. \"The cipher here,\" he pointed to a series of symbols, \"is a variant of the ancient Phoenician script. Decoding it reveals a warning: ‘Beware the shadow that walks at noon.’\"\n\nI shuddered at the ominous phrase. \"A shadow at noon? How can that be?\"\n\nHolmes’s eyes gleamed with excitement. \"A metaphor, perhaps, for someone who operates in plain sight, yet remains unseen. Our culprit is closer than we think.\"\n\nDetermined to confront the mystery head-on, we prepared to visit the warehouse at the docks. The air was thick with fog as we approached, the silence broken only by the distant lapping of waves. Holmes’s hand rested lightly on the revolver at his side, ready for whatever awaited us.\n\nInside, the warehouse was a labyrinth of crates and shadows. Suddenly, a figure emerged, cloaked in darkness. \"You’ve been meddling in affairs beyond your understanding, Mr. Holmes,\" the voice hissed.\n\nHolmes stepped forward, unwavering. \"On the contrary, it is you who has underestimated the power of observation and reason.\"\n\nA tense standoff ensued, but with swift precision, Holmes disarmed the assailant, revealing the mastermind behind the sinister plot. The mystery unraveled, justice prevailed, and once again, the streets of London were safe under the watchful eyes of Sherlock Holmes and Dr. Watson."

The ceremony, as shortly announced in the papers of yesterday, occurred on the previous morning; but it is only now that it has been possible to confirm the strange rumours which have been so persistently floating about. In spite of the attempts of the friends to hush the matter up, so much public attention has now been drawn to it that no good purpose can be served by affecting to disregard what is a common subject for conversation.\n“‘The ceremony, which was performed at St. George’s, Hanover Square, was a very quiet one, no one being present save the father of the bride, Mr. Aloysius Doran, the Duchess of Balmoral, Lord Backwater, Lord Eustace and Lady Clara St. Simon (the younger brother and sister of the bridegroom), and Lady Alicia Whittington. The whole party proceeded afterwards to the house of Mr. Aloysius Doran, at Lancaster Gate, where breakfast had been prepared. It appears that some little trouble was caused by a woman, whose name has not been ascertained, who endeavoured to force her way into the house after the bridal party, alleging that she had some claim upon Lord St. Simon. It was only after a painful and prolonged scene that she was ejected by the butler and the footman. The bride, who had fortunately entered the house before this unpleasant interruption, had sat down to breakfast with the rest, when she complained of a sudden indisposition and retired to her room. Her prolonged absence having caused some comment, her father followed her, but learned from her maid that she had only come up to her chamber for an instant, caught up an ulster and bonnet, and hurried down to the passage. One of the footmen declared that he had seen a lady leave the house thus apparelled, but had refused to credit that it was his mistress, believing her to be with the company. On ascertaining that his daughter had disappeared, Mr. Aloysius Doran, in conjunction with the bridegroom, instantly put themselves in communication with the police, and very energetic inquiries are being made, which will probably result in a speedy clearing up of this very singular business. Up to a late hour last night, however, nothing had transpired as to the whereabouts of the missing lady. There are rumours of foul play in the matter, and it is said that the police have caused the arrest of the woman who had caused the original disturbance, in the belief that, from jealousy or some other motive, she may have been concerned in the strange disappearance of the bride.’”\n“And is that all?”\n“Only one little item in another of the morning papers, but it is a suggestive one.”\n“And it is—”\n“That Miss Flora Millar, the lady who had caused the disturbance, has actually been arrested. It appears that she was formerly a danseuse at the Allegro, and that she has known the bridegroom for some years. There are no further particulars, and the whole case is in your hands now—so far as it has been set forth in the public press.”\n“And an exceedingly interesting case it appears to be.",

These additions introduce scenes and dialogue that do not exist in the source passage.\n- The completion omits the back-and-forth dialogue between Holmes and Watson that frames the reading of the article and the follow-up about the additional newspaper item.\n\n2. MISSING ELEMENTS:\n- The completion leaves out the explicit mention that the information is contained in a single article from the previous day's paper, as well as the process of Holmes reading it aloud.\n- The detailed list of wedding attendees, including their specific relationships to the bride and groom, is missing.\n- The sequence describing the bride's sudden indisposition, her retreat to her room, and the subsequent actions of her father and the maid is condensed and lacks several steps present in the original.\n- The follow-up conversation about the second newspaper item, which provides further information about the woman who caused the disturbance, is omitted.\n- The original's closing remarks about the case being in Holmes's hands and the lack of further particulars are not included.\n\n3. INACCURATE ELEMENTS:\n- The completion inaccurately places the wedding reception at a different location than in the original.\n- The timing of events, such as the wedding and the bride's disappearance, is not consistent with the original sequence.\n- The description of the guests is generalized and does not accurately reflect the specific individuals or their relationships as listed in the original.\n- The completion attributes actions and dialogue to characters (such as the footman announcing Lord St. Simon) that do not occur in the original passage.\n- The summary of the police involvement and the arrest of the woman is less detailed and omits the nuances of the original report, such as the reasons for her arrest and the rumors surrounding the case."

            "prefix-probing": "“I warn you that they are very incomplete.” Holmes laid the papers on the table before me, his keen eyes scanning the room as if expecting some invisible adversary to pounce upon us at any moment. The flickering candlelight cast long shadows across the walls of our Baker Street lodgings, lending an air of mystery to the already enigmatic documents.\n\nI leaned forward, my curiosity piqued. “Incomplete or not, Holmes, these notes might hold the key to unraveling the case that has so confounded Scotland Yard.”\n\nHolmes nodded thoughtfully. “Indeed, Watson. The case of the Speckled Band is one that has baffled even the most seasoned detectives. But I have a feeling that these fragments, when pieced together, will reveal the truth.”\n\nHe began to read aloud from the first document, a letter penned in a hurried hand:\n\n“Dear Dr. Roylott,\n\nI write to you with a heavy heart, for the circumstances surrounding my sister’s death are most peculiar. The night she passed, I heard a strange hissing sound, followed by a sudden cry. The doctors have declared it natural causes, but I am not convinced. There is something sinister at work in our household.”\n\nHolmes paused, his eyes narrowing. “The mention of a hissing sound is particularly intriguing. It suggests the presence of some creature or device capable of producing such a noise.”\n\nI nodded. “And the sudden cry indicates that the victim was taken by surprise, perhaps attacked in her sleep.”\n\n“Precisely, Watson. Now, let us examine the second document.” Holmes unfolded a sheet of paper, revealing a sketch of the layout of Stoke Moran, the Roylott estate.\n\n“The diagram shows the arrangement of the rooms, including the ventilator connecting the victim’s chamber to Dr. Roylott’s adjoining room. This architectural detail is crucial.”\n\n“Why so?” I inquired.\n\n“Because it provides a secret passage through which the assailant could have sent the deadly agent without being seen.”\n\nHolmes’s mind was already racing ahead, piecing together the puzzle. “The third document is a journal entry from the victim herself.” He cleared his throat and read:\n\n“Tonight, I heard the low whistle again. It chills me to the bone. I fear for my life, yet I dare not leave my room. The presence of the speckled band haunts my dreams.”\n\n“The speckled band,” I repeated, intrigued by the cryptic phrase.\n\nHolmes smiled grimly. “A clue, Watson. A clue that will lead us to the truth.”\n\nHe rose from his chair and began pacing the room. “We must visit Stoke Moran at once. The danger is imminent, and time is of the essence.”\n\nThe following day, we journeyed to the estate, where the oppressive atmosphere was palpable. Dr. Roylott, a man of formidable stature and temper, greeted us with a scowl.\n\nHolmes observed him keenly. “Your reputation precedes you, Doctor. But I assure you, we are here to uncover the truth, whatever it may be.”\n\nDr. Roylott’s eyes flashed with anger. “You meddle in affairs that do not concern you.”\n\nUndeterred, Holmes inspected the rooms, paying particular attention to the ventilator and the bell-pull that hung uselessly beside the bed.\n\n“Notice, Watson, that the bell-pull is a dummy, not connected to any bell. Yet it is within reach of the bed.”\n\n“An odd detail,” I remarked.\n\nHolmes nodded. “Indeed. And the ventilator connects directly to Dr. Roylott’s room. A perfect conduit for a deadly weapon.”\n\nAs night fell, we prepared to watch and wait. Holmes’s plan was simple yet daring: to catch the murderer in the act.\n\nHours passed in tense silence until a faint hissing sound broke the stillness. Suddenly, a snake, its skin marked with speckles, slithered through the ventilator toward the bed.\n\nHolmes sprang into action, seizing a stick and driving the creature back through the passage. The snake retreated, but not before Holmes had grasped its deadly nature.\n\nDr. Roylott’s scheme was laid bare: he had trained the venomous snake to kill his stepdaughters and secure his inheritance.\n\nThe next morning, the authorities took Dr. Roylott into custody, and justice was served.\n\nAs we returned to London, I marveled at Holmes’s brilliance. “Your deductions were nothing short of extraordinary, Holmes.”\n\nHe smiled modestly. “Elementary, my dear Watson. The truth is often hidden in the smallest details, waiting for the keen eye to uncover it.”\n\nThus concluded the case of the Speckled Band, a testament to the power of observation and reason in the face of darkness and deceit."

Do not dream of going, Watson, for I very much prefer having a witness, if only as a check to my own memory.”\n“Lord Robert St. Simon,” announced our page-boy, throwing open the door. A gentleman entered, with a pleasant, cultured face, high-nosed and pale, with something perhaps of petulance about the mouth, and with the steady, well-opened eye of a man whose pleasant lot it had ever been to command and to be obeyed. His manner was brisk, and yet his general appearance gave an undue impression of age, for he had a slight forward stoop and a little bend of the knees as he walked. His hair, too, as he swept off his very curly-brimmed hat, was grizzled round the edges and thin upon the top. As to his dress, it was careful to the verge of foppishness, with high collar, black frock-coat, white waistcoat, yellow gloves, patent-leather shoes, and light-coloured gaiters. He advanced slowly into the room, turning his head from left to right, and swinging in his right hand the cord which held his golden eyeglasses.\n“Good-day, Lord St. Simon,” said Holmes, rising and bowing. “Pray take the basket-chair. This is my friend and colleague, Dr. Watson. Draw up a little to the fire, and we will talk this matter over.”\n“A most painful matter to me, as you can most readily imagine, Mr. Holmes. I have been cut to the quick. I understand that you have already managed several delicate cases of this sort, sir, though I presume that they were hardly from the same class of society.”\n“No, I am descending.”\n“I beg pardon.”\n“My last client of the sort was a king.”\n“Oh, really! I had no idea. And which king?”\n“The King of Scandinavia.”\n“What! Had he lost his wife?”\n“You can understand,” said Holmes suavely, “that I extend to the affairs of my other clients the same secrecy which I promise to you in yours.”\n“Of course! Very right! very right! I’m sure I beg pardon. As to my own case, I am ready to give you any information which may assist you in forming an opinion.”\n“Thank you. I have already learned all that is in the public prints, nothing more. I presume that I may take it as correct—this article, for example, as to the disappearance of the bride.”\nLord St. Simon glanced over it. “Yes, it is correct, as far as it goes.”\n“But it needs a great deal of supplementing before anyone could offer an opinion. I think that I may arrive at my facts most directly by questioning you.”\n“Pray do so.”\n“When did you first meet Miss Hatty Doran?”\n“In San Francisco, a year ago.”\n“You were travelling in the States?”\n“Yes.”\n“Did you become engaged then?”\n“No.”\n“But you were on a friendly footing?”\n“I was amused by her society, and she could see that I was amused.”\n“Her father is very rich?”\n“He is said to be the richest man on the Pacific slope.”\n“And how did he make his money?”\n“In mining. He had nothing a few years ago. Then he struck gold, invested it, and came up by leaps and bounds.”\n“Now, what is your own impression as to the young lady’s—your wife’s character?”\nThe nobleman swung his glasses a little faster and stared down into the fire. “You see, Mr. Holmes,” said he, “my wife was twenty before her father became a rich man. During that time she ran free in a mining camp and wandered through woods or mountains, so that her education has come from Nature rather than from the schoolmaster. She is what we call in England a tomboy, with a strong nature, wild and free, unfettered by any sort of traditions. She is impetuous—volcanic, I was about to say. She is swift in making up her mind and fearless in carrying out her resolutions. On the other hand, I would not have given her the name which I have the honour to bear”—he gave a little stately cough—“had I not thought her to be at bottom a noble woman. I believe that she is capable of heroic self-sacrifice and that anything dishonourable would be repugnant to her.”\n“Have you her photograph?”\n“I brought this with me.” He opened a locket and showed us the full face of a very lovely woman. It was not a photograph but an ivory miniature, and the artist had brought out the full effect of the lustrous black hair, the large dark eyes, and the exquisite mouth. Holmes gazed long and earnestly at it. Then he closed the locket and handed it back to Lord St. Simon.\n“The young lady came to London, then, and you renewed your acquaintance?”\n“Yes, her father brought her over for this last London season. I met her several times, became engaged to her, and have now married her.”\n“She brought, I understand, a considerable dowry?”\n“A fair dowry. Not more than is usual in my family.”\n“And this, of course, remains to you, since the marriage is a fait accompli?”\n“I really have made no inquiries on the subject.”\n“Very naturally not. Did you see Miss Doran on the day before the wedding?”\n“Yes.”\n“Was she in good spirits?”\n“Never better. She kept talking of what we should do in our future lives.”\n“Indeed! That is very interesting. And on the morning of the wedding?”\n“She was as bright as possible—at least until after the ceremony.”\n“And did you observe any change in her then?”\n“Well, to tell the truth, I saw then the first signs that I had ever seen that her temper was just a little sharp. The incident however, was too trivial to relate and can have no possible bearing upon the case.”\n“Pray let us have it, for all that.”\n“Oh, it is childish. She dropped her bouquet as we went towards the vestry. She was passing the front pew at the time, and it fell over into the pew. There was a moment’s delay, but the gentleman in the pew handed it up to her again, and it did not appear to be the worse for the fall. Yet when I spoke to her of the matter, she answered me abruptly; and in the carriage, on our way home, she seemed absurdly agitated over this trifling cause.”\n“Indeed! You say that there was a gentleman in the pew. Some of the general public were present, then?”\n“Oh, yes. It is impossible to exclude them when the church is open.”\n“This gentleman was not one of your wife’s friends?”\n“No, no; I call him a gentleman by courtesy, but he was quite a common-looking person. I hardly noticed his appearance. But really I think that we are wandering rather far from the point.”\n“Lady St. Simon, then, returned from the wedding in a less cheerful frame of mind than she had gone to it. What did she do on re-entering her father’s house?”",

For some weeks past, I have been the victim of a series of strange occurrences which have caused me great anxiety.\"\n\nHolmes leaned forward, his eyes gleaming with interest. \"Pray, continue, Mr. McFarlane.\"\n\n\"It began with the disappearance of a valuable horse from my stables. The animal was a thoroughbred of exceptional quality, and its loss was a severe blow. Shortly thereafter, I received a letter, unsigned, warning me to desist from certain plans I had for the development of my property.\"\n\n\"Did you show this letter to anyone?\" Holmes inquired.\n\n\"Only to my solicitor, who advised me to inform the police. But I preferred to seek the counsel of a private detective first.\"\n\n\"A wise decision,\" Holmes remarked. \"Have there been any other incidents?\"\n\n\"Yes,\" McFarlane replied. \"Strange noises at night, the disappearance of some documents, and the feeling that I am being watched.\"\n\nHolmes nodded thoughtfully. \"I see. And what are these plans you mentioned?\"\n\n\"I intend to build a railway station on my estate, which will greatly increase its value and accessibility.\"\n\n\"Ah,\" said Holmes, \"that may explain the opposition you are encountering.\"\n\n\"Indeed,\" McFarlane agreed. \"I suspect that some parties with vested interests are attempting to thwart my project.\"\n\nHolmes rose and began to pace the room. \"Mr. McFarlane, I shall take your case. Watson, prepare your kit; we may have to visit the scene of these disturbances.\"\n\nThe following day, we accompanied Mr. McFarlane to his estate. The grounds were extensive, with rolling hills and dense woodlands. The stables were well-kept, though the absence of the prized horse was evident.\n\nHolmes examined the area meticulously, noting footprints and broken twigs. \"These tracks,\" he said, \"are fresh. Someone has been here recently.\"\n\nWe proceeded to the main house, where Holmes inspected the study. He found a torn piece of paper on the floor, which he carefully bagged as evidence.\n\n\"This case promises to be intriguing,\" he remarked. \"We must be vigilant.\"\n\nOver the next few days, Holmes and I conducted a thorough investigation, interviewing servants, neighbors, and local officials. We discovered that a rival landowner, Sir Reginald Hargrove, had expressed vehement opposition to the railway project.\n\nHolmes arranged a meeting with Sir Reginald, during which he employed his characteristic blend of charm and incisive questioning. The baronet denied any involvement in the disturbances but appeared uneasy.\n\nOne evening, as we returned to London, Holmes confided in me, \"Watson, I believe we are dealing with a conspiracy to intimidate Mr. McFarlane into abandoning his plans.\"\n\n\"But who would benefit from such actions?\" I asked.\n\n\"Sir Reginald, or perhaps others with interests aligned against progress.\"\n\nOur suspicions were soon confirmed when a letter arrived at our lodgings, threatening Holmes himself to desist from the investigation.\n\nUndeterred, Holmes devised a plan to catch the culprits in the act. We returned to the estate under the cover of darkness, hiding in the shadows near the stables.\n\nAt midnight, we observed figures moving stealthily among the buildings. Holmes signaled to me, and we sprang forward, apprehending two men who confessed to being hired agents of Sir Reginald.\n\nWith the evidence in hand, we confronted the baronet, who was forced to cease his opposition. Mr. McFarlane's project proceeded, and peace was restored to the estate.\n\nAs we departed, Holmes remarked, \"Once again, the truth has triumphed over deceit.\"\n\nI could not help but admire my friend's unwavering dedication to justice and the remarkable powers of observation and deduction that had brought this case to a successful conclusion."

          "text_segment": "“I saw her in conversation with her maid.”\n“And who is her maid?”\n“Alice is her name. She is an American and came from California with her.”\n“A confidential servant?”\n“A little too much so. It seemed to me that her mistress allowed her to take great liberties. Still, of course, in America they look upon these things in a different way.”\n“How long did she speak to this Alice?”\n“Oh, a few minutes. I had something else to think of.”\n“You did not overhear what they said?”\n“Lady St. Simon said something about ‘jumping a claim.’ She was accustomed to use slang of the kind. I have no idea what she meant.”\n“American slang is very expressive sometimes. And what did your wife do when she finished speaking to her maid?”\n“She walked into the breakfast-room.”\n“On your arm?”\n“No, alone. She was very independent in little matters like that. Then, after we had sat down for ten minutes or so, she rose hurriedly, muttered some words of apology, and left the room. She never came back.”\n“But this maid, Alice, as I understand, deposes that she went to her room, covered her bride’s dress with a long ulster, put on a bonnet, and went out.”\n“Quite so. And she was afterwards seen walking into Hyde Park in company with Flora Millar, a woman who is now in custody, and who had already made a disturbance at Mr. Doran’s house that morning.”\n“Ah, yes. I should like a few particulars as to this young lady, and your relations to her.”\nLord St. Simon shrugged his shoulders and raised his eyebrows. “We have been on a friendly footing for some years—I may say on a very friendly footing. She used to be at the Allegro. I have not treated her ungenerously, and she had no just cause of complaint against me, but you know what women are, Mr. Holmes. Flora was a dear little thing, but exceedingly hot-headed and devotedly attached to me. She wrote me dreadful letters when she heard that I was about to be married, and, to tell the truth, the reason why I had the marriage celebrated so quietly was that I feared lest there might be a scandal in the church. She came to Mr. Doran’s door just after we returned, and she endeavoured to push her way in, uttering very abusive expressions towards my wife, and even threatening her, but I had foreseen the possibility of something of the sort, and I had two police fellows there in private clothes, who soon pushed her out again. She was quiet when she saw that there was no good in making a row.”\n“Did your wife hear all this?”\n“No, thank goodness, she did not.”\n“And she was seen walking with this very woman afterwards?”\n“Yes. That is what Mr. Lestrade, of Scotland Yard, looks upon as so serious. It is thought that Flora decoyed my wife out and laid some terrible trap for her.”\n“Well, it is a possible supposition.”\n“You think so, too?”\n“I did not say a probable one. But you do not yourself look upon this as likely?”\n“I do not think Flora would hurt a fly.”\n“Still, jealousy is a strange transformer of characters. Pray what is your own theory as to what took place?”\n“Well, really, I came to seek a theory, not to propound one. I have given you all the facts. Since you ask me, however, I may say that it has occurred to me as possible that the excitement of this affair, the consciousness that she had made so immense a social stride, had the effect of causing some little nervous disturbance in my wife.”\n“In short, that she had become suddenly deranged?”\n“Well, really, when I consider that she has turned her back—I will not say upon me, but upon so much that many have aspired to without success—I can hardly explain it in any other fashion.”\n“Well, certainly that is also a conceivable hypothesis,” said Holmes, smiling. “And now, Lord St. Simon, I think that I have nearly all my data. May I ask whether you were seated at the breakfast-table so that you could see out of the window?”\n“We could see the other side of the road and the Park.”\n“Quite so. Then I do not think that I need to detain you longer. I shall communicate with you.”",

            "prefix-probing": "“I saw her in conversation with her maid.” Holmes nodded thoughtfully, his keen eyes never leaving the speaker’s face. The room was dimly lit, the flickering fire casting long shadows upon the walls, as if the very atmosphere was charged with mystery. \n\n“Indeed,” Holmes mused, “the presence of the maid at such a moment is no mere coincidence. It is often in the smallest details that the truth lies hidden.”\n\nDr. Watson, ever the faithful companion, leaned forward eagerly. “But what could have been the nature of their conversation? Surely, it must have been of some importance to warrant such secrecy.”\n\nHolmes tapped his fingers together, his mind racing through the possibilities. “The maid, being a close confidante, might have been entrusted with a secret or a message. Or perhaps she was a witness to something that the lady wished to conceal.”\n\nThe gentleman who had spoken earlier, a man of considerable stature and evident distress, interjected, “I fear that the lady’s behavior has been most peculiar of late. She has been withdrawn, and there have been whispers of a shadow over her household.”\n\nHolmes’s eyes gleamed with interest. “Whispers, you say? Then we must listen closely to these murmurs, for they often carry the seeds of truth.”\n\nAs the evening wore on, Holmes and Watson delved deeper into the enigma, piecing together fragments of information like a masterful puzzle. The maid’s role, the lady’s secretive demeanor, and the subtle hints of unrest within the household all pointed toward a hidden narrative waiting to be unveiled.\n\nIn the days that followed, Holmes’s investigations led him through winding alleys and shadowed corridors, each step bringing him closer to the heart of the mystery. The maid, initially reticent, eventually revealed a tale of love, betrayal, and danger that had ensnared the lady in a web of intrigue.\n\nThrough his unparalleled deductive reasoning, Holmes uncovered the truth that lay beneath the surface—a truth that not only solved the case but also restored peace to a troubled household. And as always, Dr. Watson chronicled the adventure, ensuring that the tale of the lady, her maid, and the secrets they shared would be remembered for generations to come."

The paper was of fine quality, and the handwriting was neat but unfamiliar. The cipher consisted of a series of numbers and letters arranged in an irregular pattern.\n\n“Have you any idea who might have sent this?” Holmes inquired.\n\n“None whatsoever,” replied Mr. Windibank. “I have no enemies that I know of, and the letter does not mention any names. It simply warns of an impending calamity and urges immediate action.”\n\nDr. Watson leaned forward, his curiosity piqued. “Did the letter specify the nature of the danger?”\n\n“Only in vague terms,” said Mr. Windibank. “It spoke of betrayal, deceit, and a threat that could not be ignored. I fear that if this warning is genuine, someone’s life may be at stake.”\n\nHolmes folded the letter carefully and placed it in his pocket. “This is indeed a matter worthy of investigation. I shall require access to any correspondence you have received recently, as well as any information about your acquaintances and business dealings.”\n\nMr. Windibank nodded. “I will provide you with everything you need. I am at your disposal, Mr. Holmes.”\n\nOver the next few days, Holmes and I delved into the mystery. Holmes’s extraordinary powers of observation and deduction soon uncovered subtle clues that had escaped ordinary notice. The cipher, once a baffling enigma, yielded its secrets under Holmes’s relentless scrutiny.\n\n“It is a substitution cipher,” Holmes explained one evening, “but with a twist. The key lies in a particular phrase that the sender has embedded within the text. Once identified, the message becomes clear.”\n\nWith Holmes’s guidance, I assisted in decoding the letter. The message revealed a warning about a planned assassination targeting a prominent figure in London society. The sender implored the recipient to intervene and prevent the tragedy.\n\nHolmes’s mind raced as he pieced together the puzzle. “We must act swiftly,” he declared. “Time is of the essence.”\n\nOur investigation led us through the labyrinthine streets of London, from the opulent drawing rooms of the aristocracy to the shadowy alleys where danger lurked. We encountered a cast of characters, each with their own secrets and motives.\n\nIn the end, Holmes’s brilliance prevailed. The would-be assassin was apprehended, and the intended victim was saved from harm. Mr. Windibank expressed his profound gratitude, acknowledging that without Holmes’s intervention, disaster would have been inevitable.\n\nAs we parted ways, Holmes remarked, “This case serves as a reminder that even the most cryptic messages can be unraveled with patience and intellect. The truth, no matter how deeply concealed, will always find its way to light.”\n\nI could not help but marvel at my friend’s genius, ever grateful to witness the triumph of reason over mystery in the heart of London."

They have been identified as her clothes, and it seemed to me that if the clothes were there the body would not be far off.”\n“By the same brilliant reasoning, every man’s body is to be found in the neighbourhood of his wardrobe. And pray what did you hope to arrive at through this?”\n“At some evidence implicating Flora Millar in the disappearance.”\n“I am afraid that you will find it difficult.”\n“Are you, indeed, now?” cried Lestrade with some bitterness. “I am afraid, Holmes, that you are not very practical with your deductions and your inferences. You have made two blunders in as many minutes. This dress does implicate Miss Flora Millar.”\n“And how?”\n“In the dress is a pocket. In the pocket is a card-case. In the card-case is a note. And here is the very note.” He slapped it down upon the table in front of him. “Listen to this: ‘You will see me when all is ready. Come at once. F. H. M.’ Now my theory all along has been that Lady St. Simon was decoyed away by Flora Millar, and that she, with confederates, no doubt, was responsible for her disappearance. Here, signed with her initials, is the very note which was no doubt quietly slipped into her hand at the door and which lured her within their reach.”\n“Very good, Lestrade,” said Holmes, laughing. “You really are very fine indeed. Let me see it.” He took up the paper in a listless way, but his attention instantly became riveted, and he gave a little cry of satisfaction. “This is indeed important,” said he.\n“Ha! you find it so?”\n“Extremely so. I congratulate you warmly.”\nLestrade rose in his triumph and bent his head to look. “Why,” he shrieked, “you’re looking at the wrong side!”\n“On the contrary, this is the right side.”\n“The right side? You’re mad! Here is the note written in pencil over here.”\n“And over here is what appears to be the fragment of a hotel bill, which interests me deeply.”\n“There’s nothing in it. I looked at it before,” said Lestrade. “‘Oct. 4th, rooms 8s., breakfast 2s. 6d., cocktail 1s., lunch 2s. 6d., glass sherry, 8d.’ I see nothing in that.”\n“Very likely not. It is most important, all the same. As to the note, it is important also, or at least the initials are, so I congratulate you again.”\n“I’ve wasted time enough,” said Lestrade, rising. “I believe in hard work and not in sitting by the fire spinning fine theories. Good-day, Mr. Holmes, and we shall see which gets to the bottom of the matter first.” He gathered up the garments, thrust them into the bag, and made for the door.",

It is precisely these qualities that make our partnership so effective.”\n\nWe were seated in our familiar quarters at 221B Baker Street, the evening light casting long shadows across the room. Holmes had just returned from a brief excursion, his keen eyes alight with the thrill of a new case.\n\n“Pray, tell me more,” I urged, leaning forward with interest.\n\nHolmes smiled faintly, the corners of his mouth twitching with amusement. “The matter concerns a certain Miss Violet Hunter, a governess of some distinction, who has found herself in a predicament most perplexing. She came to me this afternoon, seeking assistance in a matter that, at first glance, seemed trivial but soon revealed layers of complexity.”\n\nI nodded, eager to hear the details.\n\n“Miss Hunter was employed by a Mr. Woodley, a man of considerable wealth and peculiar habits. She was engaged to tutor his niece, a young lady of delicate constitution and sensitive disposition. However, shortly after her arrival, Miss Hunter began to experience strange occurrences—unexplained noises, mysterious footsteps in the night, and a general atmosphere of unease that pervaded the household.”\n\nHolmes paused, his gaze fixed upon the curling smoke of his pipe.\n\n“Did she suspect any particular individual?” I inquired.\n\n“Indeed, she did. The household was staffed by a number of servants, each with their own secrets and motives. But what intrigued me most was the presence of a certain Mr. Hosmer Angel, a gentleman who appeared suddenly and vanished just as swiftly, leaving behind a trail of questions.”\n\nHolmes’s eyes gleamed with anticipation.\n\n“I took it upon myself to investigate, visiting the estate under the guise of a prospective tutor. It was there that I uncovered a web of deceit, jealousy, and hidden identities. The key to the mystery lay not in the overt actions of the characters but in the subtle clues—the faint scent of perfume, the pattern of footsteps, the timing of the nocturnal disturbances.”\n\nI listened intently, marveling at Holmes’s ability to perceive what others overlooked.\n\n“Ultimately,” he continued, “the truth was revealed in a most unexpected manner. Miss Hunter’s suspicions were confirmed, and justice was served without the need for scandal or public exposure.”\n\nHe leaned back, a satisfied expression upon his face.\n\n“Another case closed, Watson. And once again, the power of observation and deduction has triumphed.”\n\nI smiled, grateful to be witness to the brilliance of my friend, whose intellect and insight never ceased to amaze me. The night deepened around us, but within the walls of 221B, the light of reason and discovery burned ever bright."

There is not, and there never has been, any such person.”\nLestrade looked sadly at my companion. Then he turned to me, tapped his forehead three times, shook his head solemnly, and hurried away.\nHe had hardly shut the door behind him when Holmes rose to put on his overcoat. “There is something in what the fellow says about outdoor work,” he remarked, “so I think, Watson, that I must leave you to your papers for a little.”\nIt was after five o’clock when Sherlock Holmes left me, but I had no time to be lonely, for within an hour there arrived a confectioner’s man with a very large flat box. This he unpacked with the help of a youth whom he had brought with him, and presently, to my very great astonishment, a quite epicurean little cold supper began to be laid out upon our humble lodging-house mahogany. There were a couple of brace of cold woodcock, a pheasant, a pâté de foie gras pie with a group of ancient and cobwebby bottles. Having laid out all these luxuries, my two visitors vanished away, like the genii of the Arabian Nights, with no explanation save that the things had been paid for and were ordered to this address.\nJust before nine o’clock Sherlock Holmes stepped briskly into the room. His features were gravely set, but there was a light in his eye which made me think that he had not been disappointed in his conclusions.\n“They have laid the supper, then,” he said, rubbing his hands.\n“You seem to expect company. They have laid for five.”\n“Yes, I fancy we may have some company dropping in,” said he. “I am surprised that Lord St. Simon has not already arrived. Ha! I fancy that I hear his step now upon the stairs.”\nIt was indeed our visitor of the afternoon who came bustling in, dangling his glasses more vigorously than ever, and with a very perturbed expression upon his aristocratic features.\n“My messenger reached you, then?” asked Holmes.\n“Yes, and I confess that the contents startled me beyond measure. Have you good authority for what you say?”\n“The best possible.”\nLord St. Simon sank into a chair and passed his hand over his forehead.\n“What will the Duke say,” he murmured, “when he hears that one of the family has been subjected to such humiliation?”\n“It is the purest accident. I cannot allow that there is any humiliation.”\n“Ah, you look on these things from another standpoint.”\n“I fail to see that anyone is to blame. I can hardly see how the lady could have acted otherwise, though her abrupt method of doing it was undoubtedly to be regretted. Having no mother, she had no one to advise her at such a crisis.”\n“It was a slight, sir, a public slight,” said Lord St. Simon, tapping his fingers upon the table.\n“You must make allowance for this poor girl, placed in so unprecedented a position.”\n“I will make no allowance. I am very angry indeed, and I have been shamefully used.”\n“I think that I heard a ring,” said Holmes. “Yes, there are steps on the landing. If I cannot persuade you to take a lenient view of the matter, Lord St. Simon, I have brought an advocate here who may be more successful.” He opened the door and ushered in a lady and gentleman. “Lord St. Simon,” said he “allow me to introduce you to Mr. and Mrs. Francis Hay Moulton. The lady, I think, you have already met.”\nAt the sight of these newcomers our client had sprung from his seat and stood very erect, with his eyes cast down and his hand thrust into the breast of his frock-coat, a picture of offended dignity. The lady had taken a quick step forward and had held out her hand to him, but he still refused to raise his eyes. It was as well for his resolution, perhaps, for her pleading face was one which it was hard to resist.\n“You’re angry, Robert,” said she. “Well, I guess you have every cause to be.”\n“Pray make no apology to me,” said Lord St. Simon bitterly.\n“Oh, yes, I know that I have treated you real bad and that I should have spoken to you before I went; but I was kind of rattled, and from the time when I saw Frank here again I just didn’t know what I was doing or saying. I only wonder I didn’t fall down and do a faint right there before the altar.”\n“Perhaps, Mrs. Moulton, you would like my friend and me to leave the room while you explain this matter?”\n“If I may give an opinion,” remarked the strange gentleman, “we’ve had just a little too much secrecy over this business already. For my part, I should like all Europe and America to hear the rights of it.” He was a small, wiry, sunburnt man, clean-shaven, with a sharp face and alert manner.\n“Then I’ll tell our story right away,” said the lady. “Frank here and I met in ’84, in McQuire’s camp, near the Rockies, where Pa was working a claim. We were engaged to each other, Frank and I; but then one day father struck a rich pocket and made a pile, while poor Frank here had a claim that petered out and came to nothing. The richer Pa grew the poorer was Frank; so at last Pa wouldn’t hear of our engagement lasting any longer, and he took me away to ’Frisco. Frank wouldn’t throw up his hand, though; so he followed me there, and he saw me without Pa knowing anything about it. It would only have made him mad to know, so we just fixed it all up for ourselves. Frank said that he would go and make his pile, too, and never come back to claim me until he had as much as Pa. So then I promised to wait for him to the end of time and pledged myself not to marry anyone else while he lived. ‘Why shouldn’t we be married right away, then,’ said he, ‘and then I will feel sure of you; and I won’t claim to be your husband until I come back?’ Well, we talked it over, and he had fixed it all up so nicely, with a clergyman all ready in waiting, that we just did it right there; and then Frank went off to seek his fortune, and I went back to Pa.\n“The next I heard of Frank was that he was in Montana, and then he went prospecting in Arizona, and then I heard of him from New Mexico. After that came a long newspaper story about how a miners’ camp had been attacked by Apache Indians, and there was my Frank’s name among the killed. I fainted dead away, and I was very sick for months after. Pa thought I had a decline and took me to half the doctors in ’Frisco. Not a word of news came for a year and more, so that I never doubted that Frank was really dead. Then Lord St. Simon came to ’Frisco, and we came to London, and a marriage was arranged, and Pa was very pleased, but I felt all the time that no man on this earth would ever take the place in my heart that had been given to my poor Frank.\n“Still, if I had married Lord St. Simon, of course I’d have done my duty by him. We can’t command our love, but we can our actions. I went to the altar with him with the intention to make him just as good a wife as it was in me to be. But you may imagine what I felt when, just as I came to the altar rails, I glanced back and saw Frank standing and looking at me out of the first pew. I thought it was his ghost at first; but when I looked again there he was still, with a kind of question in his eyes, as if to ask me whether I were glad or sorry to see him. I wonder I didn’t drop. I know that everything was turning round, and the words of the clergyman were just like the buzz of a bee in my ear. I didn’t know what to do. Should I stop the service and make a scene in the church? I glanced at him again, and he seemed to know what I was thinking, for he raised his finger to his lips to tell me to be still. Then I saw him scribble on a piece of paper, and I knew that he was writing me a note. As I passed his pew on the way out I dropped my bouquet over to him, and he slipped the note into my hand when he returned me the flowers. It was only a line asking me to join him when he made the sign to me to do so. Of course I never doubted for a moment that my first duty was now to him, and I determined to do just whatever he might direct.\n“When I got back I told my maid, who had known him in California, and had always been his friend. I ordered her to say nothing, but to get a few things packed and my ulster ready. I know I ought to have spoken to Lord St. Simon, but it was dreadful hard before his mother and all those great people. I just made up my mind to run away and explain afterwards. I hadn’t been at the table ten minutes before I saw Frank out of the window at the other side of the road. He beckoned to me and then began walking into the Park. I slipped out, put on my things, and followed him. Some woman came talking something or other about Lord St. Simon to me—seemed to me from the little I heard as if he had a little secret of his own before marriage also—but I managed to get away from her and soon overtook Frank. We got into a cab together, and away we drove to some lodgings he had taken in Gordon Square, and that was my true wedding after all those years of waiting. Frank had been a prisoner among the Apaches, had escaped, came on to ’Frisco, found that I had given him up for dead and had gone to England, followed me there, and had come upon me at last on the very morning of my second wedding.”\n“I saw it in a paper,” explained the American. “It gave the name and the church but not where the lady lived.”\n“Then we had a talk as to what we should do, and Frank was all for openness, but I was so ashamed of it all that I felt as if I should like to vanish away and never see any of them again—just sending a line to Pa, perhaps, to show him that I was alive. It was awful to me to think of all those lords and ladies sitting round that breakfast-table and waiting for me to come back. So Frank took my wedding-clothes and things and made a bundle of them, so that I should not be traced, and dropped them away somewhere where no one could find them. It is likely that we should have gone on to Paris to-morrow, only that this good gentleman, Mr. Holmes, came round to us this evening, though how he found us is more than I can think, and he showed us very clearly and kindly that I was wrong and that Frank was right, and that we should be putting ourselves in the wrong if we were so secret. Then he offered to give us a chance of talking to Lord St. Simon alone, and so we came right away round to his rooms at once. Now, Robert, you have heard it all, and I am very sorry if I have given you pain, and I hope that you do not think very meanly of me.”",

          "text_segment": "Lord St. Simon had by no means relaxed his rigid attitude, but had listened with a frowning brow and a compressed lip to this long narrative.\n“Excuse me,” he said, “but it is not my custom to discuss my most intimate personal affairs in this public manner.”\n“Then you won’t forgive me? You won’t shake hands before I go?”\n“Oh, certainly, if it would give you any pleasure.” He put out his hand and coldly grasped that which she extended to him.\n“I had hoped,” suggested Holmes, “that you would have joined us in a friendly supper.”\n“I think that there you ask a little too much,” responded his Lordship. “I may be forced to acquiesce in these recent developments, but I can hardly be expected to make merry over them. I think that with your permission I will now wish you all a very good-night.” He included us all in a sweeping bow and stalked out of the room.\n“Then I trust that you at least will honour me with your company,” said Sherlock Holmes. “It is always a joy to meet an American, Mr. Moulton, for I am one of those who believe that the folly of a monarch and the blundering of a minister in far-gone years will not prevent our children from being some day citizens of the same world-wide country under a flag which shall be a quartering of the Union Jack with the Stars and Stripes.”\n“The case has been an interesting one,” remarked Holmes when our visitors had left us, “because it serves to show very clearly how simple the explanation may be of an affair which at first sight seems to be almost inexplicable. Nothing could be more natural than the sequence of events as narrated by this lady, and nothing stranger than the result when viewed, for instance, by Mr. Lestrade of Scotland Yard.”\n“You were not yourself at fault at all, then?”\n“From the first, two facts were very obvious to me, the one that the lady had been quite willing to undergo the wedding ceremony, the other that she had repented of it within a few minutes of returning home. Obviously something had occurred during the morning, then, to cause her to change her mind. What could that something be? She could not have spoken to anyone when she was out, for she had been in the company of the bridegroom. Had she seen someone, then? If she had, it must be someone from America because she had spent so short a time in this country that she could hardly have allowed anyone to acquire so deep an influence over her that the mere sight of him would induce her to change her plans so completely. You see we have already arrived, by a process of exclusion, at the idea that she might have seen an American. Then who could this American be, and why should he possess so much influence over her? It might be a lover; it might be a husband. Her young womanhood had, I knew, been spent in rough scenes and under strange conditions. So far I had got before I ever heard Lord St. Simon’s narrative. When he told us of a man in a pew, of the change in the bride’s manner, of so transparent a device for obtaining a note as the dropping of a bouquet, of her resort to her confidential maid, and of her very significant allusion to claim-jumping—which in miners’ parlance means taking possession of that which another person has a prior claim to—the whole situation became absolutely clear. She had gone off with a man, and the man was either a lover or was a previous husband—the chances being in favour of the latter.”\n“And how in the world did you find them?”\n“It might have been difficult, but friend Lestrade held information in his hands the value of which he did not himself know. The initials were, of course, of the highest importance, but more valuable still was it to know that within a week he had settled his bill at one of the most select London hotels.”\n“How did you deduce the select?”\n“By the select prices. Eight shillings for a bed and eightpence for a glass of sherry pointed to one of the most expensive hotels. There are not many in London which charge at that rate. In the second one which I visited in Northumberland Avenue, I learned by an inspection of the book that Francis H. Moulton, an American gentleman, had left only the day before, and on looking over the entries against him, I came upon the very items which I had seen in the duplicate bill. His letters were to be forwarded to 226 Gordon Square; so thither I travelled, and being fortunate enough to find the loving couple at home, I ventured to give them some paternal advice and to point out to them that it would be better in every way that they should make their position a little clearer both to the general public and to Lord St. Simon in particular. I invited them to meet him here, and, as you see, I made him keep the appointment.”\n“But with no very good result,” I remarked. “His conduct was certainly not very gracious.”\n“Ah, Watson,” said Holmes, smiling, “perhaps you would not be very gracious either, if, after all the trouble of wooing and wedding, you found yourself deprived in an instant of wife and of fortune. I think that we may judge Lord St. Simon very mercifully and thank our stars that we are never likely to find ourselves in the same position. Draw your chair up and hand me my violin, for the only problem we have still to solve is how to while away these bleak autumnal evenings.”",

When Holmes had finished, he sat for a moment in silence, his eyes fixed upon the fire, and then he turned to me with a smile. \"Well, Watson,\" he said, \"what do you make of it?\" I was at a loss. The story was so strange, so full of unexpected turns, that I could hardly believe it to be true. Yet Holmes's manner was so earnest, so confident, that I was compelled to accept it as fact.\n\n\"It is certainly a most extraordinary case,\" I said. \"But what is your theory?\"\n\nHolmes leaned forward, his eyes gleaming with excitement. \"My theory,\" he said, \"is that the whole affair is the work of a clever and determined criminal, who has used every means at his disposal to conceal his identity and his purpose. The disappearance of the lady, the mysterious messages, the strange behavior of the servants—all point to a carefully planned scheme.\"\n\nLord St. Simon nodded slowly. \"I have always suspected as much,\" he said. \"But what can be done? The police have been baffled, and the lady remains missing.\"\n\nHolmes smiled. \"That is where I come in,\" he said. \"I have already set certain wheels in motion, and I am confident that before long we shall have the answers we seek.\"\n\nOver the next few days, Holmes and I devoted ourselves to the investigation. We visited the scene of the disappearance, questioned the servants and neighbors, and examined every clue with the utmost care. Holmes's keen eye missed nothing, and his deductions grew ever more precise.\n\nOne evening, as we sat in our rooms at Baker Street, Holmes suddenly sprang to his feet. \"Watson,\" he exclaimed, \"I have it! The key to the whole mystery lies in the letter that was found in the lady's room.\"\n\nHe produced the letter, and we examined it together. It was written in a strange cipher, which Holmes quickly deciphered. The message revealed a secret meeting place and a time, suggesting that the lady had arranged to meet someone in secret.\n\n\"We must go there at once,\" said Holmes. \"It is our only chance to find her.\"\n\nWe set out immediately, and after a short journey, we arrived at a secluded cottage on the outskirts of the city. Holmes approached cautiously, and we soon discovered that the lady was indeed there, held captive by a man who had been seeking to force her into marriage for her fortune.\n\nWith Holmes's quick thinking and my assistance, we managed to rescue the lady and bring the villain to justice. Lord St. Simon was overjoyed, and the lady expressed her deepest gratitude to Holmes and me.\n\nAs we returned to Baker Street, Holmes turned to me with a smile. \"Another case solved, Watson,\" he said. \"And once again, reason and observation have triumphed over deceit and treachery.\"\n\nI could not help but agree, and I felt a renewed admiration for my friend's remarkable talents."

It seems rather sad that his relatives should allow him to come out alone.”\nMy friend rose lazily from his armchair and stood with his hands in the pockets of his dressing-gown, looking over my shoulder. It was a bright, crisp February morning, and the snow of the day before still lay deep upon the ground, shimmering brightly in the wintry sun. Down the centre of Baker Street it had been ploughed into a brown crumbly band by the traffic, but at either side and on the heaped-up edges of the footpaths it still lay as white as when it fell. The grey pavement had been cleaned and scraped, but was still dangerously slippery, so that there were fewer passengers than usual. Indeed, from the direction of the Metropolitan Station no one was coming save the single gentleman whose eccentric conduct had drawn my attention.\nHe was a man of about fifty, tall, portly, and imposing, with a massive, strongly marked face and a commanding figure. He was dressed in a sombre yet rich style, in black frock-coat, shining hat, neat brown gaiters, and well-cut pearl-grey trousers. Yet his actions were in absurd contrast to the dignity of his dress and features, for he was running hard, with occasional little springs, such as a weary man gives who is little accustomed to set any tax upon his legs. As he ran he jerked his hands up and down, waggled his head, and writhed his face into the most extraordinary contortions.\n“What on earth can be the matter with him?” I asked. “He is looking up at the numbers of the houses.”\n“I believe that he is coming here,” said Holmes, rubbing his hands.\n“Here?”\n“Yes; I rather think he is coming to consult me professionally. I think that I recognise the symptoms. Ha! did I not tell you?” As he spoke, the man, puffing and blowing, rushed at our door and pulled at our bell until the whole house resounded with the clanging.\nA few moments later he was in our room, still puffing, still gesticulating, but with so fixed a look of grief and despair in his eyes that our smiles were turned in an instant to horror and pity. For a while he could not get his words out, but swayed his body and plucked at his hair like one who has been driven to the extreme limits of his reason. Then, suddenly springing to his feet, he beat his head against the wall with such force that we both rushed upon him and tore him away to the centre of the room. Sherlock Holmes pushed him down into the easy-chair and, sitting beside him, patted his hand and chatted with him in the easy, soothing tones which he knew so well how to employ.",

The street was ploughed and cleared in the middle, but the sides were still covered with the white, crisp snow, which made the pavement slippery and difficult for the pedestrians. The houses on Baker Street were wrapped in a cold, grey light, and the air was sharp and biting.\n\nHolmes, who was sitting by the fire, rose and came to the window. He was dressed in his usual fashion, with his dressing-gown thrown loosely about him, and his keen eyes followed the figure below with interest.\n\nThe man was about fifty years of age, of a stout build, and well dressed in a dark overcoat and a hat pulled low over his forehead. Yet his manner was wild and erratic. He ran along the pavement, stopping suddenly to peer at the numbers on the houses, then making strange gestures with his hands, twisting his face into odd contortions, and plucking at his hair as if in great distress.\n\n\"He is certainly not in his right mind,\" I remarked.\n\n\"No,\" said Holmes, \"but there is method in his madness. Observe how he checks the numbers. He is looking for a particular house.\"\n\nThe man paused beneath our window, looked up, and then hurried on with renewed energy. Holmes smiled.\n\n\"He is coming here,\" said he. \"I know the symptoms.\"\n\nPresently, the man reached our door and rang the bell with such insistence and force that the sound echoed through the house. He pulled at the handle, and when no one answered immediately, he rang again, more loudly than before.\n\nHolmes opened the door and ushered the visitor into the room. The man was breathless and agitated, his eyes wild and his face flushed with excitement. But as he caught sight of Holmes and me, his expression changed suddenly. The frantic energy gave way to a deep and overwhelming grief. His lips quivered, and a heavy silence fell upon the room.\n\nHe swayed unsteadily, plucked at his hair, and then, with a sudden movement, began to beat his head against the wall. Holmes and I sprang forward to restrain him.\n\n\"Sit down, my friend,\" said Holmes gently, patting the man's hand. \"You are safe here. Take a moment to compose yourself.\"\n\nThe visitor sank into a chair, his breath coming in gasps, and after a while, he looked up at us with eyes full of despair but calmer than before.\n\n\"Now,\" said Holmes softly, \"tell us what has brought you here in such a state.\"",

MISSING ELEMENTS:\n- Early in the passage, the completion lacks the detailed setting: the specific weather conditions, the state of the snow, and the appearance of Baker Street, including the contrast between the ploughed street and the untouched snow on the sides.\n- The description of the pavement’s condition and its effect on pedestrian traffic is missing.\n- The completion does not include the detailed physical description of the visitor’s clothing and stature, which is present in the original.\n- The original passage contains a more nuanced depiction of the man’s erratic movements and gestures, which is only briefly summarized in the completion.\n- The sequence of Holmes’s deductions and the narrator’s observations is compressed, omitting the back-and-forth dialogue and Holmes’s specific reactions.\n- The completion omits the detail of the man pulling at the bell and the resulting noise throughout the house.\n- The original includes a moment where the visitor’s distress transforms the mood in the room from amusement to concern, which is only partially captured in the completion.\n- The specific actions of the visitor (swaying, plucking at his hair) before he beats his head against the wall are not included.\n- The completion does not mention Holmes’s specific method of comforting the visitor, such as patting his hand and using a particular tone of voice.\n\n3. INACCURATE ELEMENTS:\n- The completion introduces a slight inaccuracy by suggesting the man was running as if pursued, which is not specified in the original.\n- The sequence of events is somewhat altered: the completion has Holmes and the narrator observing together earlier than in the original, and the transition from the man’s arrival to his entry into the room is less detailed.\n- The emotional transition from amusement to pity is less clearly delineated and lacks the immediacy found in the original.\n- The completion invents a line about Holmes encouraging the visitor to rest before telling his story, which is not present in the original passage."

            "prefix-probing": "He is wringing his hands and muttering to himself. What do you make of it?”\n\nHolmes glanced up from the chemical experiment he was conducting and followed my gaze. “Ah, Watson, you have a keen eye. That man is indeed in a state of great agitation. Let us observe him closely.”\n\nThe figure approached, his face pale and drawn, eyes darting nervously from side to side. He seemed to be talking to himself in hurried whispers, occasionally glancing over his shoulder as if pursued by some unseen foe.\n\n“Notice, Watson,” Holmes remarked, “the irregular gait and the tremor in his hands. These are signs of extreme mental distress, possibly induced by some recent trauma or fear.”\n\nAs the man drew nearer, he suddenly stopped in front of our window, his eyes locking onto mine. “You must help me,” he implored, voice trembling. “They are after me, and I have nowhere to turn.”\n\nHolmes rose and opened the door. “Come in, sir. You are safe here. Tell us what troubles you.”\n\nThe man stepped inside, closing the door behind him. “My name is Henry Baskerville,” he began, “and I fear for my life. There is a curse upon my family, a dark legend that haunts the moors. I have come to London seeking protection and counsel.”\n\nHolmes nodded thoughtfully. “The Baskerville name is familiar. Pray, continue.”\n\nHenry took a deep breath and recounted the tale of the Baskerville estate, the mysterious death of his uncle, and the ominous sightings of a spectral hound that terrorized the countryside. “I have heard that you, Mr. Holmes, are a man who can unravel the most perplexing mysteries. I beg you to assist me in uncovering the truth behind this curse.”\n\nWatson exchanged a glance with Holmes, who was already deep in thought. “We shall take your case, Mr. Baskerville,” Holmes declared. “Fear not, for we will bring light to the shadows that surround your family.”\n\nThus began one of our most thrilling adventures, a journey that would lead us to the desolate moors, confrontations with unknown dangers, and the unveiling of secrets long buried. The case of the Baskerville curse would test our wits and courage, but with steadfast resolve, we set forth to confront the darkness that loomed over the ancient estate."

Pray wait until you have recovered yourself, and then I shall be most happy to look into any little problem which you may submit to me.”\nThe man sat for a minute or more with a heaving chest, fighting against his emotion. Then he passed his handkerchief over his brow, set his lips tight, and turned his face towards us.\n“No doubt you think me mad?” said he.\n“I see that you have had some great trouble,” responded Holmes.\n“God knows I have!—a trouble which is enough to unseat my reason, so sudden and so terrible is it. Public disgrace I might have faced, although I am a man whose character has never yet borne a stain. Private affliction also is the lot of every man; but the two coming together, and in so frightful a form, have been enough to shake my very soul. Besides, it is not I alone. The very noblest in the land may suffer unless some way be found out of this horrible affair.”\n“Pray compose yourself, sir,” said Holmes, “and let me have a clear account of who you are and what it is that has befallen you.”\n“My name,” answered our visitor, “is probably familiar to your ears. I am Alexander Holder, of the banking firm of Holder & Stevenson, of Threadneedle Street.”\nThe name was indeed well known to us as belonging to the senior partner in the second largest private banking concern in the City of London. What could have happened, then, to bring one of the foremost citizens of London to this most pitiable pass? We waited, all curiosity, until with another effort he braced himself to tell his story.\n“I feel that time is of value,” said he; “that is why I hastened here when the police inspector suggested that I should secure your co-operation. I came to Baker Street by the Underground and hurried from there on foot, for the cabs go slowly through this snow. That is why I was so out of breath, for I am a man who takes very little exercise. I feel better now, and I will put the facts before you as shortly and yet as clearly as I can.\n“It is, of course, well known to you that in a successful banking business as much depends upon our being able to find remunerative investments for our funds as upon our increasing our connection and the number of our depositors. One of our most lucrative means of laying out money is in the shape of loans, where the security is unimpeachable. We have done a good deal in this direction during the last few years, and there are many noble families to whom we have advanced large sums upon the security of their pictures, libraries, or plate.\n“Yesterday morning I was seated in my office at the bank when a card was brought in to me by one of the clerks. I started when I saw the name, for it was that of none other than—well, perhaps even to you I had better say no more than that it was a name which is a household word all over the earth—one of the highest, noblest, most exalted names in England. I was overwhelmed by the honour and attempted, when he entered, to say so, but he plunged at once into business with the air of a man who wishes to hurry quickly through a disagreeable task.\n“‘Mr. Holder,’ said he, ‘I have been informed that you are in the habit of advancing money.’\n“‘The firm does so when the security is good.’ I answered.\n“‘It is absolutely essential to me,’ said he, ‘that I should have £ 50,000 at once. I could, of course, borrow so trifling a sum ten times over from my friends, but I much prefer to make it a matter of business and to carry out that business myself. In my position you can readily understand that it is unwise to place one’s self under obligations.’\n“‘For how long, may I ask, do you want this sum?’ I asked.\n“‘Next Monday I have a large sum due to me, and I shall then most certainly repay what you advance, with whatever interest you think it right to charge. But it is very essential to me that the money should be paid at once.’\n“‘I should be happy to advance it without further parley from my own private purse,’ said I, ‘were it not that the strain would be rather more than it could bear. If, on the other hand, I am to do it in the name of the firm, then in justice to my partner I must insist that, even in your case, every businesslike precaution should be taken.’\n“‘I should much prefer to have it so,’ said he, raising up a square, black morocco case which he had laid beside his chair. ‘You have doubtless heard of the Beryl Coronet?’\n“‘One of the most precious public possessions of the empire,’ said I.\n“‘Precisely.’ He opened the case, and there, imbedded in soft, flesh-coloured velvet, lay the magnificent piece of jewellery which he had named. ‘There are thirty-nine enormous beryls,’ said he, ‘and the price of the gold chasing is incalculable. The lowest estimate would put the worth of the coronet at double the sum which I have asked. I am prepared to leave it with you as my security.’\n“I took the precious case into my hands and looked in some perplexity from it to my illustrious client.\n“‘You doubt its value?’ he asked.\n“‘Not at all. I only doubt—’\n“‘The propriety of my leaving it. You may set your mind at rest about that. I should not dream of doing so were it not absolutely certain that I should be able in four days to reclaim it. It is a pure matter of form. Is the security sufficient?’\n“‘Ample.’\n“‘You understand, Mr. Holder, that I am giving you a strong proof of the confidence which I have in you, founded upon all that I have heard of you. I rely upon you not only to be discreet and to refrain from all gossip upon the matter but, above all, to preserve this coronet with every possible precaution because I need not say that a great public scandal would be caused if any harm were to befall it. Any injury to it would be almost as serious as its complete loss, for there are no beryls in the world to match these, and it would be impossible to replace them. I leave it with you, however, with every confidence, and I shall call for it in person on Monday morning.’\n“Seeing that my client was anxious to leave, I said no more but, calling for my cashier, I ordered him to pay over fifty £ 1000 notes. When I was alone once more, however, with the precious case lying upon the table in front of me, I could not but think with some misgivings of the immense responsibility which it entailed upon me. There could be no doubt that, as it was a national possession, a horrible scandal would ensue if any misfortune should occur to it. I already regretted having ever consented to take charge of it. However, it was too late to alter the matter now, so I locked it up in my private safe and turned once more to my work.\n“When evening came I felt that it would be an imprudence to leave so precious a thing in the office behind me. Bankers’ safes had been forced before now, and why should not mine be? If so, how terrible would be the position in which I should find myself! I determined, therefore, that for the next few days I would always carry the case backward and forward with me, so that it might never be really out of my reach. With this intention, I called a cab and drove out to my house at Streatham, carrying the jewel with me. I did not breathe freely until I had taken it upstairs and locked it in the bureau of my dressing-room.\n“And now a word as to my household, Mr. Holmes, for I wish you to thoroughly understand the situation. My groom and my page sleep out of the house, and may be set aside altogether. I have three maid-servants who have been with me a number of years and whose absolute reliability is quite above suspicion. Another, Lucy Parr, the second waiting-maid, has only been in my service a few months. She came with an excellent character, however, and has always given me satisfaction. She is a very pretty girl and has attracted admirers who have occasionally hung about the place. That is the only drawback which we have found to her, but we believe her to be a thoroughly good girl in every way.\n“So much for the servants. My family itself is so small that it will not take me long to describe it. I am a widower and have an only son, Arthur. He has been a disappointment to me, Mr. Holmes—a grievous disappointment. I have no doubt that I am myself to blame. People tell me that I have spoiled him. Very likely I have. When my dear wife died I felt that he was all I had to love. I could not bear to see the smile fade even for a moment from his face. I have never denied him a wish. Perhaps it would have been better for both of us had I been sterner, but I meant it for the best.\n“It was naturally my intention that he should succeed me in my business, but he was not of a business turn. He was wild, wayward, and, to speak the truth, I could not trust him in the handling of large sums of money. When he was young he became a member of an aristocratic club, and there, having charming manners, he was soon the intimate of a number of men with long purses and expensive habits. He learned to play heavily at cards and to squander money on the turf, until he had again and again to come to me and implore me to give him an advance upon his allowance, that he might settle his debts of honour. He tried more than once to break away from the dangerous company which he was keeping, but each time the influence of his friend, Sir George Burnwell, was enough to draw him back again.\n“And, indeed, I could not wonder that such a man as Sir George Burnwell should gain an influence over him, for he has frequently brought him to my house, and I have found myself that I could hardly resist the fascination of his manner. He is older than Arthur, a man of the world to his finger-tips, one who had been everywhere, seen everything, a brilliant talker, and a man of great personal beauty. Yet when I think of him in cold blood, far away from the glamour of his presence, I am convinced from his cynical speech and the look which I have caught in his eyes that he is one who should be deeply distrusted. So I think, and so, too, thinks my little Mary, who has a woman’s quick insight into character.\n“And now there is only she to be described. She is my niece; but when my brother died five years ago and left her alone in the world I adopted her, and have looked upon her ever since as my daughter. She is a sunbeam in my house—sweet, loving, beautiful, a wonderful manager and housekeeper, yet as tender and quiet and gentle as a woman could be. She is my right hand. I do not know what I could do without her. In only one matter has she ever gone against my wishes. Twice my boy has asked her to marry him, for he loves her devotedly, but each time she has refused him.",

            "prefix-probing": "“You have come to me to tell your story, have you not?” said he.\n\nI nodded, feeling a mixture of relief and apprehension. The room was dimly lit, the flickering flame of the fireplace casting long shadows on the walls. Sherlock Holmes sat opposite me, his keen eyes fixed intently upon my face, as if trying to read the very thoughts that troubled me.\n\n“Yes,” I replied, “I have come to you because I believe you are the only one who can help me unravel this mystery.”\n\nHolmes leaned forward, steepling his fingers. “Very well. Begin at the beginning, and do not omit a single detail, no matter how trivial it may seem.”\n\nI took a deep breath and began my tale.\n\nIt all started a fortnight ago, when I received a letter bearing no return address. The handwriting was elegant yet unfamiliar, and the paper was of a peculiar texture, almost like parchment. The letter read:\n\n\"Dear Sir,\n\nI write to you in utmost confidence and with a matter of grave importance. Should you choose to accept this invitation, you will find yourself embroiled in a mystery that defies explanation. Meet me at the old clock tower at midnight tomorrow. Come alone.\n\nYours sincerely,\nA Friend\"\n\nThe letter left me perplexed and intrigued. Who could this 'Friend' be, and what mystery awaited me at the clock tower? Despite my reservations, curiosity compelled me to go.\n\nAt the stroke of midnight, I arrived at the clock tower, its ancient gears creaking in the stillness of the night. A shadowy figure emerged from the darkness, cloaked and hooded.\n\n\"You have come,\" the figure whispered. \"Good. Time is of the essence.\"\n\nBefore I could respond, the figure handed me a small, ornate box and vanished into the night.\n\nI hurried home, my mind racing with questions. What was inside the box? Why had I been summoned? I carefully opened it to find a delicate golden key and a folded piece of parchment.\n\nThe parchment bore a cryptic message:\n\n\"Unlock the secrets hidden beneath the city. The truth lies where shadows converge.\"\n\nPuzzled, I sought the counsel of a trusted friend, who suggested I consult Sherlock Holmes.\n\nAnd so, here I am, seeking your guidance, Mr. Holmes.\"\n\nHolmes listened intently, his eyes gleaming with interest. \"A most intriguing beginning,\" he mused. \"The key and the message suggest a hidden location, perhaps an underground chamber or a secret passage.\"\n\nHe rose and paced the room, his mind evidently at work. \"Tell me, have you noticed any unusual places in the city where shadows seem to converge?\"\n\nI thought for a moment. \"There is the old catacombs beneath the city, long abandoned and shrouded in darkness.\"\n\nHolmes nodded. \"Excellent. We shall investigate there. Prepare yourself; the night holds many secrets.\"\n\nTogether, we made our way to the entrance of the catacombs, the air growing colder and the darkness more profound as we descended. The key fit perfectly into a hidden lock, revealing a passageway illuminated by faint, flickering torches.\n\nWithin, we discovered a chamber adorned with ancient symbols and inscriptions. At its center lay a chest, locked and waiting.\n\nUsing the golden key, Holmes opened the chest to reveal a collection of documents and artifacts, shedding light on a long-forgotten conspiracy that threatened the very fabric of our society.\n\nAs we delved deeper into the mystery, we uncovered a web of deceit, betrayal, and hidden agendas, each revelation more startling than the last.\n\nThrough Holmes's unparalleled deductive skills and my unwavering resolve, we pieced together the puzzle, bringing justice to those who sought to conceal the truth.\n\nIn the end, the shadows that once concealed danger were dispelled by the light of knowledge and courage.\n\nHolmes turned to me with a satisfied smile. \"Another case closed, my friend. But remember, the world is full of mysteries waiting to be uncovered.\"\n\nI nodded, grateful for his wisdom and companionship, ready to face whatever challenges lay ahead."

Lucy Parr, who had brought in the coffee, had, I am sure, left the room; but I cannot swear that the door was closed. Mary and Arthur were much interested and wished to see the famous coronet, but I thought it better not to disturb it.\n“‘Where have you put it?’ asked Arthur.\n“‘In my own bureau.’\n“‘Well, I hope to goodness the house won’t be burgled during the night.’ said he.\n“‘It is locked up,’ I answered.\n“‘Oh, any old key will fit that bureau. When I was a youngster I have opened it myself with the key of the box-room cupboard.’\n“He often had a wild way of talking, so that I thought little of what he said. He followed me to my room, however, that night with a very grave face.\n“‘Look here, dad,’ said he with his eyes cast down, ‘can you let me have £ 200?’\n“‘No, I cannot!’ I answered sharply. ‘I have been far too generous with you in money matters.’\n“‘You have been very kind,’ said he, ‘but I must have this money, or else I can never show my face inside the club again.’\n“‘And a very good thing, too!’ I cried.\n“‘Yes, but you would not have me leave it a dishonoured man,’ said he. ‘I could not bear the disgrace. I must raise the money in some way, and if you will not let me have it, then I must try other means.’\n“I was very angry, for this was the third demand during the month. ‘You shall not have a farthing from me,’ I cried, on which he bowed and left the room without another word.\n“When he was gone I unlocked my bureau, made sure that my treasure was safe, and locked it again. Then I started to go round the house to see that all was secure—a duty which I usually leave to Mary but which I thought it well to perform myself that night. As I came down the stairs I saw Mary herself at the side window of the hall, which she closed and fastened as I approached.\n“‘Tell me, dad,’ said she, looking, I thought, a little disturbed, ‘did you give Lucy, the maid, leave to go out to-night?’\n“‘Certainly not.’\n“‘She came in just now by the back door. I have no doubt that she has only been to the side gate to see someone, but I think that it is hardly safe and should be stopped.’\n“‘You must speak to her in the morning, or I will if you prefer it. Are you sure that everything is fastened?’\n“‘Quite sure, dad.’\n“‘Then, good-night.’ I kissed her and went up to my bedroom again, where I was soon asleep.\n“I am endeavouring to tell you everything, Mr. Holmes, which may have any bearing upon the case, but I beg that you will question me upon any point which I do not make clear.”\n“On the contrary, your statement is singularly lucid.”\n“I come to a part of my story now in which I should wish to be particularly so. I am not a very heavy sleeper, and the anxiety in my mind tended, no doubt, to make me even less so than usual. About two in the morning, then, I was awakened by some sound in the house. It had ceased ere I was wide awake, but it had left an impression behind it as though a window had gently closed somewhere. I lay listening with all my ears. Suddenly, to my horror, there was a distinct sound of footsteps moving softly in the next room. I slipped out of bed, all palpitating with fear, and peeped round the corner of my dressing-room door.\n“‘Arthur!’ I screamed, ‘you villain! you thief! How dare you touch that coronet?’\n“The gas was half up, as I had left it, and my unhappy boy, dressed only in his shirt and trousers, was standing beside the light, holding the coronet in his hands. He appeared to be wrenching at it, or bending it with all his strength. At my cry he dropped it from his grasp and turned as pale as death. I snatched it up and examined it. One of the gold corners, with three of the beryls in it, was missing.\n“‘You blackguard!’ I shouted, beside myself with rage. ‘You have destroyed it! You have dishonoured me forever! Where are the jewels which you have stolen?’\n“‘Stolen!’ he cried.\n“‘Yes, thief!’ I roared, shaking him by the shoulder.\n“‘There are none missing. There cannot be any missing,’ said he.\n“‘There are three missing. And you know where they are. Must I call you a liar as well as a thief? Did I not see you trying to tear off another piece?’\n“‘You have called me names enough,’ said he, ‘I will not stand it any longer. I shall not say another word about this business, since you have chosen to insult me. I will leave your house in the morning and make my own way in the world.’\n“‘You shall leave it in the hands of the police!’ I cried half-mad with grief and rage. ‘I shall have this matter probed to the bottom.’\n“‘You shall learn nothing from me,’ said he with a passion such as I should not have thought was in his nature. ‘If you choose to call the police, let the police find what they can.’\n“By this time the whole house was astir, for I had raised my voice in my anger. Mary was the first to rush into my room, and, at the sight of the coronet and of Arthur’s face, she read the whole story and, with a scream, fell down senseless on the ground. I sent the housemaid for the police and put the investigation into their hands at once. When the inspector and a constable entered the house, Arthur, who had stood sullenly with his arms folded, asked me whether it was my intention to charge him with theft. I answered that it had ceased to be a private matter, but had become a public one, since the ruined coronet was national property. I was determined that the law should have its way in everything.\n“‘At least,’ said he, ‘you will not have me arrested at once. It would be to your advantage as well as mine if I might leave the house for five minutes.’\n“‘That you may get away, or perhaps that you may conceal what you have stolen,’ said I. And then, realising the dreadful position in which I was placed, I implored him to remember that not only my honour but that of one who was far greater than I was at stake; and that he threatened to raise a scandal which would convulse the nation. He might avert it all if he would but tell me what he had done with the three missing stones.\n“‘You may as well face the matter,’ said I; ‘you have been caught in the act, and no confession could make your guilt more heinous. If you but make such reparation as is in your power, by telling us where the beryls are, all shall be forgiven and forgotten.’\n“‘Keep your forgiveness for those who ask for it,’ he answered, turning away from me with a sneer. I saw that he was too hardened for any words of mine to influence him. There was but one way for it. I called in the inspector and gave him into custody. A search was made at once not only of his person but of his room and of every portion of the house where he could possibly have concealed the gems; but no trace of them could be found, nor would the wretched boy open his mouth for all our persuasions and our threats. This morning he was removed to a cell, and I, after going through all the police formalities, have hurried round to you to implore you to use your skill in unravelling the matter. The police have openly confessed that they can at present make nothing of it. You may go to any expense which you think necessary. I have already offered a reward of £ 1000. My God, what shall I do! I have lost my honour, my gems, and my son in one night. Oh, what shall I do!”",

The story of the ill-fated Charles Augustus Milverton, the notorious blackmailer, had taken a dark turn, and the shadows of despair seemed to close in upon all involved.\n\nHolmes had been engaged by a young lady of high birth, the Honorable Irene Adler, who sought his assistance in retrieving compromising letters that Milverton held over her. The letters, if published, would have ruined her reputation and that of her family. Holmes, ever the master of disguise and cunning, had devised a plan to infiltrate Milverton's house and secure the letters.\n\nThe night was cold and still as we approached the blackmailer's residence. Holmes, dressed as a clergyman, and I, as his companion, made our way to the back of the house, where a window had been left unlatched. With practiced ease, Holmes slipped inside, and I waited anxiously in the shadows.\n\nMinutes later, a shot rang out, and Holmes emerged, clutching a small packet of papers. We hurried away, hearts pounding, knowing that Milverton's reign of terror was at an end. Yet, the victory was bittersweet, for the cost had been great.\n\nIn the days that followed, the letters were returned to Miss Adler, and her honor was preserved. But the memory of the events lingered, a reminder of the fragile line between justice and vengeance.\n\nHolmes, ever the stoic, resumed his investigations with renewed vigor, but I could see the weight of the case upon him. It was a testament to the complexities of human nature and the shadows that lurk beneath the surface of society.\n\nAs we sat by the fire in our Baker Street lodgings, Holmes mused, \"The world is full of obvious things which nobody by any chance ever observes. Yet, in the darkness, a single light can reveal the truth.\"\n\nI nodded, understanding that in our line of work, the pursuit of truth often came at a personal cost. But it was a cost we were willing to bear, for the sake of justice and the hope of a better tomorrow.\n\nThus concluded one of the most remarkable adventures in our shared history, a tale of courage, cunning, and the enduring power of the human spirit."

She is four-and-twenty.”\n“This matter, from what you say, seems to have been a shock to her also.”\n“Terrible! She is even more affected than I.”\n“You have neither of you any doubt as to your son’s guilt?”\n“How can we have when I saw him with my own eyes with the coronet in his hands.”\n“I hardly consider that a conclusive proof. Was the remainder of the coronet at all injured?”\n“Yes, it was twisted.”\n“Do you not think, then, that he might have been trying to straighten it?”\n“God bless you! You are doing what you can for him and for me. But it is too heavy a task. What was he doing there at all? If his purpose were innocent, why did he not say so?”\n“Precisely. And if it were guilty, why did he not invent a lie? His silence appears to me to cut both ways. There are several singular points about the case. What did the police think of the noise which awoke you from your sleep?”\n“They considered that it might be caused by Arthur’s closing his bedroom door.”\n“A likely story! As if a man bent on felony would slam his door so as to wake a household. What did they say, then, of the disappearance of these gems?”\n“They are still sounding the planking and probing the furniture in the hope of finding them.”\n“Have they thought of looking outside the house?”\n“Yes, they have shown extraordinary energy. The whole garden has already been minutely examined.”\n“Now, my dear sir,” said Holmes, “is it not obvious to you now that this matter really strikes very much deeper than either you or the police were at first inclined to think? It appeared to you to be a simple case; to me it seems exceedingly complex. Consider what is involved by your theory. You suppose that your son came down from his bed, went, at great risk, to your dressing-room, opened your bureau, took out your coronet, broke off by main force a small portion of it, went off to some other place, concealed three gems out of the thirty-nine, with such skill that nobody can find them, and then returned with the other thirty-six into the room in which he exposed himself to the greatest danger of being discovered. I ask you now, is such a theory tenable?”\n“But what other is there?” cried the banker with a gesture of despair. “If his motives were innocent, why does he not explain them?”\n“It is our task to find that out,” replied Holmes; “so now, if you please, Mr. Holder, we will set off for Streatham together, and devote an hour to glancing a little more closely into details.”\nMy friend insisted upon my accompanying them in their expedition, which I was eager enough to do, for my curiosity and sympathy were deeply stirred by the story to which we had listened. I confess that the guilt of the banker’s son appeared to me to be as obvious as it did to his unhappy father, but still I had such faith in Holmes’ judgment that I felt that there must be some grounds for hope as long as he was dissatisfied with the accepted explanation. He hardly spoke a word the whole way out to the southern suburb, but sat with his chin upon his breast and his hat drawn over his eyes, sunk in the deepest thought. Our client appeared to have taken fresh heart at the little glimpse of hope which had been presented to him, and he even broke into a desultory chat with me over his business affairs.",

            "prefix-probing": "Sherlock Holmes sat silent for some few minutes, with his brows knitted and his eyes fixed upon the fire. The flickering flames cast dancing shadows upon the walls of the room, creating an atmosphere thick with anticipation. Dr. John Watson, his faithful companion, observed him quietly, sensing that the great detective's mind was at work, unraveling the threads of a mystery that had yet to be fully revealed.\n\n\"Holmes,\" Watson finally ventured, breaking the silence, \"you seem deeply engrossed. What thoughts occupy your mind so intensely?\"\n\nHolmes turned his gaze from the fire to his friend, a faint smile playing upon his lips. \"Watson, the case before us is unlike any we have encountered. The subtle clues, the hidden motives, and the intricate web of deceit all point to a challenge worthy of our combined intellects.\"\n\nWatson nodded, eager to assist in any way he could. \"Then let us begin at once. What is the nature of this perplexing case?\"\n\nHolmes leaned forward, his eyes gleaming with excitement. \"It concerns the mysterious disappearance of a valuable manuscript from the British Museum. The document, an ancient text of immense historical significance, vanished without a trace. No signs of forced entry, no witnesses, and no apparent motive.\"\n\n\"A theft of such magnitude must have been meticulously planned,\" Watson remarked. \"Have the authorities made any progress?\"\n\n\"They have been baffled,\" Holmes replied. \"But I believe the answer lies not in the obvious, but in the overlooked. The key to this puzzle is hidden in the details that others have dismissed.\"\n\nAs Holmes spoke, he began to pace the room, his mind racing through possibilities. \"Consider the security measures in place at the museum. The guards, the locks, the surveillance. Yet, the manuscript disappeared. How?\"\n\n\"Perhaps an insider was involved,\" Watson suggested. \"Someone with access and knowledge of the museum's operations.\"\n\nHolmes nodded thoughtfully. \"Precisely. And that is where our investigation must focus. We must identify who had both the opportunity and the motive to commit such a crime.\"\n\nThe detective's eyes sparkled with determination. \"Watson, prepare yourself. We shall visit the museum at once and begin our inquiries. The game is afoot.\"\n\nTogether, they donned their coats and stepped into the fog-laden streets of London, the city's gas lamps casting a dim glow upon the cobblestones. The night air was crisp, carrying with it the promise of discovery and the thrill of the chase.\n\nUpon arriving at the British Museum, they were greeted by the curator, a distinguished gentleman named Mr. Abernathy. His face bore the marks of worry and fatigue.\n\n\"Mr. Holmes, Dr. Watson,\" he said, extending a trembling hand. \"I am grateful for your assistance. The loss of the manuscript has shaken us all.\"\n\nHolmes examined the scene with keen eyes, noting the placement of objects, the condition of the display case, and the expressions of the staff. \"Tell me, Mr. Abernathy, who had access to the manuscript on the day it disappeared?\"\n\n\"Only a select few,\" the curator replied. \"The head librarian, the security chief, and myself.\"\n\nHolmes's gaze sharpened. \"And were there any unusual occurrences or visitors that day?\"\n\n\"None that I am aware of,\" Abernathy answered. \"But I must confess, there was a peculiar gentleman who requested to view the manuscript shortly before its disappearance.\"\n\n\"Describe him,\" Holmes urged.\n\n\"He was tall, with a sharp nose and piercing eyes. He spoke with a foreign accent and carried a leather satchel.\"\n\nHolmes exchanged a glance with Watson. \"This visitor may hold the key to our mystery. We must identify him and uncover his intentions.\"\n\nTheir investigation led them through the labyrinthine corridors of the museum, questioning staff and examining records. Each clue brought them closer to the truth, yet the puzzle remained elusive.\n\nDays passed, and the tension mounted. Holmes's relentless pursuit of the facts uncovered a trail leading to a shadowy figure known only as \"The Raven,\" a notorious art thief with a penchant for rare manuscripts.\n\nIn a daring confrontation beneath the moonlit sky, Holmes and Watson confronted The Raven in a deserted warehouse. The thief, cornered and desperate, revealed the location of the stolen manuscript.\n\nWith the case resolved and the manuscript returned to its rightful place, Holmes and Watson reflected on the adventure. The detective's mind, ever restless, was already turning to the next enigma awaiting their attention.\n\n\"Another victory for reason and deduction,\" Holmes mused, \"and a reminder that even the most intricate mysteries can be unraveled with patience and insight.\"\n\nWatson smiled, grateful to share in the triumphs and trials of his extraordinary friend. Together, they stepped back into the London fog, ready to face whatever challenges lay ahead."

          "text_segment": "A short railway journey and a shorter walk brought us to Fairbank, the modest residence of the great financier.\nFairbank was a good-sized square house of white stone, standing back a little from the road. A double carriage-sweep, with a snow-clad lawn, stretched down in front to two large iron gates which closed the entrance. On the right side was a small wooden thicket, which led into a narrow path between two neat hedges stretching from the road to the kitchen door, and forming the tradesmen’s entrance. On the left ran a lane which led to the stables, and was not itself within the grounds at all, being a public, though little used, thoroughfare. Holmes left us standing at the door and walked slowly all round the house, across the front, down the tradesmen’s path, and so round by the garden behind into the stable lane. So long was he that Mr. Holder and I went into the dining-room and waited by the fire until he should return. We were sitting there in silence when the door opened and a young lady came in. She was rather above the middle height, slim, with dark hair and eyes, which seemed the darker against the absolute pallor of her skin. I do not think that I have ever seen such deadly paleness in a woman’s face. Her lips, too, were bloodless, but her eyes were flushed with crying. As she swept silently into the room she impressed me with a greater sense of grief than the banker had done in the morning, and it was the more striking in her as she was evidently a woman of strong character, with immense capacity for self-restraint. Disregarding my presence, she went straight to her uncle and passed her hand over his head with a sweet womanly caress.\n“You have given orders that Arthur should be liberated, have you not, dad?” she asked.\n“No, no, my girl, the matter must be probed to the bottom.”\n“But I am so sure that he is innocent. You know what woman’s instincts are. I know that he has done no harm and that you will be sorry for having acted so harshly.”\n“Why is he silent, then, if he is innocent?”\n“Who knows? Perhaps because he was so angry that you should suspect him.”\n“How could I help suspecting him, when I actually saw him with the coronet in his hand?”\n“Oh, but he had only picked it up to look at it. Oh, do, do take my word for it that he is innocent. Let the matter drop and say no more. It is so dreadful to think of our dear Arthur in prison!”\n“I shall never let it drop until the gems are found—never, Mary! Your affection for Arthur blinds you as to the awful consequences to me. Far from hushing the thing up, I have brought a gentleman down from London to inquire more deeply into it.”\n“This gentleman?” she asked, facing round to me.\n“No, his friend. He wished us to leave him alone. He is round in the stable lane now.”\n“The stable lane?” She raised her dark eyebrows. “What can he hope to find there? Ah! this, I suppose, is he. I trust, sir, that you will succeed in proving, what I feel sure is the truth, that my cousin Arthur is innocent of this crime.”\n“I fully share your opinion, and I trust, with you, that we may prove it,” returned Holmes, going back to the mat to knock the snow from his shoes. “I believe I have the honour of addressing Miss Mary Holder. Might I ask you a question or two?”\n“Pray do, sir, if it may help to clear this horrible affair up.”\n“You heard nothing yourself last night?”\n“Nothing, until my uncle here began to speak loudly. I heard that, and I came down.”\n“You shut up the windows and doors the night before. Did you fasten all the windows?”\n“Yes.”\n“Were they all fastened this morning?”\n“Yes.”\n“You have a maid who has a sweetheart? I think that you remarked to your uncle last night that she had been out to see him?”\n“Yes, and she was the girl who waited in the drawing-room, and who may have heard uncle’s remarks about the coronet.”\n“I see. You infer that she may have gone out to tell her sweetheart, and that the two may have planned the robbery.”\n“But what is the good of all these vague theories,” cried the banker impatiently, “when I have told you that I saw Arthur with the coronet in his hands?”\n“Wait a little, Mr. Holder. We must come back to that. About this girl, Miss Holder. You saw her return by the kitchen door, I presume?”\n“Yes; when I went to see if the door was fastened for the night I met her slipping in. I saw the man, too, in the gloom.”\n“Do you know him?”\n“Oh, yes! he is the greengrocer who brings our vegetables round. His name is Francis Prosper.”\n“He stood,” said Holmes, “to the left of the door—that is to say, farther up the path than is necessary to reach the door?”\n“Yes, he did.”\n“And he is a man with a wooden leg?”\nSomething like fear sprang up in the young lady’s expressive black eyes. “Why, you are like a magician,” said she. “How do you know that?” She smiled, but there was no answering smile in Holmes’ thin, eager face.\n“I should be very glad now to go upstairs,” said he. “I shall probably wish to go over the outside of the house again. Perhaps I had better take a look at the lower windows before I go up.”\nHe walked swiftly round from one to the other, pausing only at the large one which looked from the hall onto the stable lane. This he opened and made a very careful examination of the sill with his powerful magnifying lens. “Now we shall go upstairs,” said he at last.",

After a brief exchange of greetings, Holmes requested to inspect the exterior of the house, and, with a nod of assent from Holder, he set off at once, walking rapidly around the grounds. He examined the tradesmen's path, the stable lane, and the various windows with a practised eye, noting every detail with the aid of his magnifying glass.

The house, though not grandiose, bore the unmistakable mark of wealth and taste, with its well-kept gardens and the subtle elegance of its architecture. As we approached, the air was filled with the faint scent of blooming roses, mingling with the crisp morning breeze.\n\nInside, the atmosphere was one of quiet dignity. The rooms were adorned with fine art and rich furnishings, yet there was an absence of ostentation. It was clear that the owner valued substance over show. We were greeted by a butler who led us into a spacious study where the financier awaited us.\n\nHe was a man of imposing presence, his sharp eyes betraying a keen intellect and a lifetime of experience in the world of finance. His handshake was firm, and his voice carried the confidence of one accustomed to command.\n\n\"Welcome to Fairbank,\" he said, gesturing for us to take seats. \"I trust your journey was pleasant?\"\n\nWe exchanged pleasantries before delving into the matter at hand. The financier had summoned us to discuss a peculiar case that had recently come to his attention—a matter that, despite its financial implications, bore the hallmarks of a mystery worthy of Sherlock Holmes himself.\n\nHe recounted the tale of a series of inexplicable transactions and disappearances within his vast network of investments. Funds had vanished without trace, and key personnel had resigned under mysterious circumstances. The pattern suggested more than mere financial mismanagement; it hinted at a deliberate and cunning scheme.\n\nAs he spoke, I observed the subtle interplay of emotions across his face—concern, frustration, and a hint of fear. It was evident that this was not merely a business problem but a personal affront.\n\nHolmes listened intently, his fingers steepled beneath his chin. When the financier concluded, he leaned forward, his eyes gleaming with interest.\n\n\"This is indeed a matter that requires careful investigation,\" Holmes remarked. \"May I inquire about the individuals involved and the nature of these transactions?\"\n\nThe financier provided detailed accounts, including names, dates, and amounts. He spoke of a shadowy figure known only as 'The Broker,' who seemed to orchestrate the disappearances and manipulate the financial flows.\n\nHolmes nodded thoughtfully. \"I propose we begin by examining the ledgers and correspondence related to these transactions. There may be clues hidden in the minutiae that can unravel this web.\"\n\nOver the next several hours, we pored over documents, cross-referencing entries and noting inconsistencies. Holmes's analytical mind worked tirelessly, piecing together fragments of information into a coherent narrative.\n\nAs evening fell, a breakthrough emerged. A series of coded messages embedded within routine communications pointed to a clandestine meeting place—a warehouse on the outskirts of the city.\n\n\"We must investigate this location,\" Holmes declared. \"It may hold the key to exposing 'The Broker' and his accomplices.\"\n\nUnder the cover of darkness, we made our way to the warehouse. The building was dilapidated, its windows boarded and its doors secured with heavy chains. Yet, through a narrow gap, we could discern the flicker of candlelight and the murmur of voices.\n\nHolmes signaled for silence and motioned us to follow him as he deftly picked the lock. Inside, we found a group of men engaged in a heated discussion, their faces obscured by shadows.\n\nListening intently, Holmes gathered that they were planning a major financial coup, one that would destabilize the market and enrich themselves at the expense of countless innocents.\n\nSuddenly, a creak echoed through the room. The men turned, their eyes narrowing as they spotted us. A tense confrontation ensued, but Holmes's quick thinking and our combined efforts subdued the conspirators.\n\nWith the evidence secured, we returned to Fairbank, where the financier expressed profound gratitude. The mystery had been solved, and justice would be served.\n\nAs we departed, Holmes reflected on the case. \"It is a reminder,\" he mused, \"that even in the world of finance, where numbers reign supreme, human greed and deception can weave the most intricate of puzzles.\"\n\nThe journey back was quiet, each of us lost in thought, contemplating the delicate balance between wealth and integrity, and the enduring pursuit of truth."

It was a magnificent specimen of the jeweller’s art, and the thirty-six stones were the finest that I have ever seen. At one side of the coronet was a cracked edge, where a corner holding three gems had been torn away.\n“Now, Mr. Holder,” said Holmes, “here is the corner which corresponds to that which has been so unfortunately lost. Might I beg that you will break it off.”\nThe banker recoiled in horror. “I should not dream of trying,” said he.\n“Then I will.” Holmes suddenly bent his strength upon it, but without result. “I feel it give a little,” said he; “but, though I am exceptionally strong in the fingers, it would take me all my time to break it. An ordinary man could not do it. Now, what do you think would happen if I did break it, Mr. Holder? There would be a noise like a pistol shot. Do you tell me that all this happened within a few yards of your bed and that you heard nothing of it?”\n“I do not know what to think. It is all dark to me.”\n“But perhaps it may grow lighter as we go. What do you think, Miss Holder?”\n“I confess that I still share my uncle’s perplexity.”\n“Your son had no shoes or slippers on when you saw him?”\n“He had nothing on save only his trousers and shirt.”\n“Thank you. We have certainly been favoured with extraordinary luck during this inquiry, and it will be entirely our own fault if we do not succeed in clearing the matter up. With your permission, Mr. Holder, I shall now continue my investigations outside.”\nHe went alone, at his own request, for he explained that any unnecessary footmarks might make his task more difficult. For an hour or more he was at work, returning at last with his feet heavy with snow and his features as inscrutable as ever.\n“I think that I have seen now all that there is to see, Mr. Holder,” said he; “I can serve you best by returning to my rooms.”\n“But the gems, Mr. Holmes. Where are they?”\n“I cannot tell.”\nThe banker wrung his hands. “I shall never see them again!” he cried. “And my son? You give me hopes?”\n“My opinion is in no way altered.”\n“Then, for God’s sake, what was this dark business which was acted in my house last night?”\n“If you can call upon me at my Baker Street rooms to-morrow morning between nine and ten I shall be happy to do what I can to make it clearer. I understand that you give me carte blanche to act for you, provided only that I get back the gems, and that you place no limit on the sum I may draw.”\n“I would give my fortune to have them back.”\n“Very good. I shall look into the matter between this and then. Good-bye; it is just possible that I may have to come over here again before evening.”\nIt was obvious to me that my companion’s mind was now made up about the case, although what his conclusions were was more than I could even dimly imagine. Several times during our homeward journey I endeavoured to sound him upon the point, but he always glided away to some other topic, until at last I gave it over in despair. It was not yet three when we found ourselves in our rooms once more.",

The window looked out upon a quiet street, where the occasional footstep echoed softly against the cobblestones. Holmes stood by the bureau, examining the various articles scattered upon its surface. A silver watch, a pair of cufflinks, and a small leather-bound notebook lay among the personal effects, each telling a silent story of the man who had used them.\n\nI observed Holmes closely as he moved with deliberate care, his keen eyes missing nothing. \"Notice, Watson,\" he said, pointing to a faint smudge upon the mirror's edge, \"the residue of a powder, perhaps from a glove or a handkerchief. It suggests that our banker was in a hurry, or perhaps anxious, when he last used this room.\"\n\nI nodded, impressed by his attention to detail. Holmes continued, \"The bureau drawers are slightly ajar, indicating a search or a hurried departure. Yet, the absence of any sign of forced entry suggests that the banker himself opened them, or that someone with his knowledge did so.\"\n\nAs we examined the room further, a sudden noise from the adjoining chamber caught our attention. We moved swiftly, Holmes leading the way with his characteristic decisiveness. There, we found the banker himself, seated and pale, his hands trembling as he clutched a letter.\n\n\"Mr. Holmes,\" he began, his voice strained, \"I fear I am the victim of a most perplexing mystery. My safe has been tampered with, and certain documents of great importance have vanished.\"\n\nHolmes regarded him thoughtfully. \"Tell me everything from the beginning,\" he urged.\n\nThe banker recounted the events of the previous evening, describing the arrival of a mysterious visitor and the subsequent discovery of the missing papers. As he spoke, Holmes's eyes narrowed, piecing together the fragments of the tale.\n\n\"Watson,\" he said at last, \"we must act swiftly. The trail is fresh, and the culprit may yet be within our reach.\"\n\nTogether, we set out into the London night, following the subtle clues that would lead us to the heart of the mystery. The city's fog wrapped around us like a shroud, but Holmes's mind was as clear and sharp as ever, guiding us through the labyrinth of intrigue and deception.\n\nHours later, in a dimly lit tavern, we confronted the man who had sought to deceive and steal. With Holmes's unerring logic and my steadfast support, justice was swiftly served, and the banker's documents were restored.\n\nAs dawn broke over the city, I reflected on the night's adventure, grateful once more for the extraordinary mind of my friend, Sherlock Holmes, whose brilliance had illuminated the darkest corners of the case."

With his collar turned up, his shiny, seedy coat, his red cravat, and his worn boots, he was a perfect sample of the class.\n“I think that this should do,” said he, glancing into the glass above the fireplace. “I only wish that you could come with me, Watson, but I fear that it won’t do. I may be on the trail in this matter, or I may be following a will-o’-the-wisp, but I shall soon know which it is. I hope that I may be back in a few hours.” He cut a slice of beef from the joint upon the sideboard, sandwiched it between two rounds of bread, and thrusting this rude meal into his pocket he started off upon his expedition.\nI had just finished my tea when he returned, evidently in excellent spirits, swinging an old elastic-sided boot in his hand. He chucked it down into a corner and helped himself to a cup of tea.\n“I only looked in as I passed,” said he. “I am going right on.”\n“Where to?”\n“Oh, to the other side of the West End. It may be some time before I get back. Don’t wait up for me in case I should be late.”\n“How are you getting on?”\n“Oh, so so. Nothing to complain of. I have been out to Streatham since I saw you last, but I did not call at the house. It is a very sweet little problem, and I would not have missed it for a good deal. However, I must not sit gossiping here, but must get these disreputable clothes off and return to my highly respectable self.”\nI could see by his manner that he had stronger reasons for satisfaction than his words alone would imply. His eyes twinkled, and there was even a touch of colour upon his sallow cheeks. He hastened upstairs, and a few minutes later I heard the slam of the hall door, which told me that he was off once more upon his congenial hunt.\nI waited until midnight, but there was no sign of his return, so I retired to my room. It was no uncommon thing for him to be away for days and nights on end when he was hot upon a scent, so that his lateness caused me no surprise. I do not know at what hour he came in, but when I came down to breakfast in the morning there he was with a cup of coffee in one hand and the paper in the other, as fresh and trim as possible.\n“You will excuse my beginning without you, Watson,” said he, “but you remember that our client has rather an early appointment this morning.”\n“Why, it is after nine now,” I answered. “I should not be surprised if that were he. I thought I heard a ring.”\nIt was, indeed, our friend the financier. I was shocked by the change which had come over him, for his face which was naturally of a broad and massive mould, was now pinched and fallen in, while his hair seemed to me at least a shade whiter. He entered with a weariness and lethargy which was even more painful than his violence of the morning before, and he dropped heavily into the armchair which I pushed forward for him.\n“I do not know what I have done to be so severely tried,” said he. “Only two days ago I was a happy and prosperous man, without a care in the world. Now I am left to a lonely and dishonoured age. One sorrow comes close upon the heels of another. My niece, Mary, has deserted me.”\n“Deserted you?”\n“Yes. Her bed this morning had not been slept in, her room was empty, and a note for me lay upon the hall table. I had said to her last night, in sorrow and not in anger, that if she had married my boy all might have been well with him. Perhaps it was thoughtless of me to say so. It is to that remark that she refers in this note:\n“‘MY DEAREST UNCLE,—I feel that I have brought trouble upon you, and that if I had acted differently this terrible misfortune might never have occurred. I cannot, with this thought in my mind, ever again be happy under your roof, and I feel that I must leave you forever. Do not worry about my future, for that is provided for; and, above all, do not search for me, for it will be fruitless labour and an ill-service to me. In life or in death, I am ever your loving,\n“‘MARY.’\n“What could she mean by that note, Mr. Holmes? Do you think it points to suicide?”\n“No, no, nothing of the kind. It is perhaps the best possible solution. I trust, Mr. Holder, that you are nearing the end of your troubles.”\n“Ha! You say so! You have heard something, Mr. Holmes; you have learned something! Where are the gems?”\n“You would not think £ 1000 apiece an excessive sum for them?”\n“I would pay ten.”\n“That would be unnecessary. Three thousand will cover the matter. And there is a little reward, I fancy. Have you your cheque-book? Here is a pen. Better make it out for £ 4000.”\nWith a dazed face the banker made out the required check. Holmes walked over to his desk, took out a little triangular piece of gold with three gems in it, and threw it down upon the table.\nWith a shriek of joy our client clutched it up.\n“You have it!” he gasped. “I am saved! I am saved!”\nThe reaction of joy was as passionate as his grief had been, and he hugged his recovered gems to his bosom.\n“There is one other thing you owe, Mr. Holder,” said Sherlock Holmes rather sternly.\n“Owe!” He caught up a pen. “Name the sum, and I will pay it.”\n“No, the debt is not to me. You owe a very humble apology to that noble lad, your son, who has carried himself in this matter as I should be proud to see my own son do, should I ever chance to have one.”\n“Then it was not Arthur who took them?”\n“I told you yesterday, and I repeat to-day, that it was not.”\n“You are sure of it! Then let us hurry to him at once to let him know that the truth is known.”\n“He knows it already. When I had cleared it all up I had an interview with him, and finding that he would not tell me the story, I told it to him, on which he had to confess that I was right and to add the very few details which were not yet quite clear to me. Your news of this morning, however, may open his lips.”",

The night was dark and foggy, the streets of London shrouded in a thick mist that clung to the gas lamps and blurred the outlines of the buildings. Holmes moved swiftly and silently, his keen eyes scanning the shadows for any sign of movement. He had received a cryptic message that morning, a plea for help from a distressed young woman whose brother had vanished without a trace. The case promised to be as perplexing as any he had encountered, and his mind was already racing through the possibilities.\n\nAs he made his way through the labyrinthine alleys, Holmes's thoughts were interrupted by the sudden appearance of a figure emerging from the gloom. It was a man, tall and gaunt, with a face etched by hardship and eyes that darted nervously. \"Are you the gentleman who seeks the missing Mr. Jameson?\" the man whispered.\n\nHolmes nodded, his interest piqued. \"I am. And you are?\"\n\n\"A friend of the family,\" the man replied. \"I have information that may be of use, but we must speak where we cannot be overheard.\"\n\nThey slipped into a nearby tavern, its dim interior filled with the murmur of low voices and the clinking of glasses. The man leaned close, lowering his voice further. \"Mr. Jameson was last seen near the docks, involved with some unsavory characters. There is talk of a secret meeting tonight at the old warehouse on Pier 9.\"\n\nHolmes's eyes gleamed with determination. \"Then that is where we must go.\"\n\nLeaving the tavern, they made their way to the waterfront, the air thick with the scent of salt and coal smoke. The warehouse loomed ahead, a dark silhouette against the night sky. Holmes signaled for silence as they approached, and he pressed his ear to the wooden door, catching the murmur of voices within.\n\nInside, a group of men were gathered around a table strewn with papers and maps. Holmes recognized one as a notorious smuggler he had encountered before. The conversation was hushed but urgent, discussing shipments and rendezvous points.\n\nSuddenly, a creak echoed through the room, and the men turned toward the door. Holmes and his companion slipped back into the shadows, narrowly avoiding detection. \"We must find another way in,\" Holmes whispered.\n\nCircling the building, they discovered a narrow window left ajar. Holmes deftly climbed inside, landing silently on the floor. He gestured for his companion to follow, and together they crept toward the center of the room.\n\nThere, bound and gagged, was Mr. Jameson, his eyes wide with fear but unharmed. Holmes quickly untied him, whispering reassurances. \"We must leave at once.\"\n\nAs they made their escape, the smuggler's men realized their captive was gone and gave chase. Holmes led the way through a maze of crates and barrels, his knowledge of the warehouse's layout giving them the advantage.\n\nBursting through a side door, they plunged into the foggy night, the shouts of their pursuers fading behind them. Once safely away, Holmes turned to Mr. Jameson. \"You are safe now, but we must uncover who is behind this plot and bring them to justice.\"\n\nThe adventure was far from over, but with his characteristic resolve and intellect, Holmes was ready to face whatever challenges lay ahead."

And let me say to you, first, that which it is hardest for me to say and for you to hear: there has been an understanding between Sir George Burnwell and your niece Mary. They have now fled together.”\n“My Mary? Impossible!”\n“It is unfortunately more than possible; it is certain. Neither you nor your son knew the true character of this man when you admitted him into your family circle. He is one of the most dangerous men in England—a ruined gambler, an absolutely desperate villain, a man without heart or conscience. Your niece knew nothing of such men. When he breathed his vows to her, as he had done to a hundred before her, she flattered herself that she alone had touched his heart. The devil knows best what he said, but at least she became his tool and was in the habit of seeing him nearly every evening.”\n“I cannot, and I will not, believe it!” cried the banker with an ashen face.\n“I will tell you, then, what occurred in your house last night. Your niece, when you had, as she thought, gone to your room, slipped down and talked to her lover through the window which leads into the stable lane. His footmarks had pressed right through the snow, so long had he stood there. She told him of the coronet. His wicked lust for gold kindled at the news, and he bent her to his will. I have no doubt that she loved you, but there are women in whom the love of a lover extinguishes all other loves, and I think that she must have been one. She had hardly listened to his instructions when she saw you coming downstairs, on which she closed the window rapidly and told you about one of the servants’ escapade with her wooden-legged lover, which was all perfectly true.\n“Your boy, Arthur, went to bed after his interview with you but he slept badly on account of his uneasiness about his club debts. In the middle of the night he heard a soft tread pass his door, so he rose and, looking out, was surprised to see his cousin walking very stealthily along the passage until she disappeared into your dressing-room. Petrified with astonishment, the lad slipped on some clothes and waited there in the dark to see what would come of this strange affair. Presently she emerged from the room again, and in the light of the passage-lamp your son saw that she carried the precious coronet in her hands. She passed down the stairs, and he, thrilling with horror, ran along and slipped behind the curtain near your door, whence he could see what passed in the hall beneath. He saw her stealthily open the window, hand out the coronet to someone in the gloom, and then closing it once more hurry back to her room, passing quite close to where he stood hid behind the curtain.\n“As long as she was on the scene he could not take any action without a horrible exposure of the woman whom he loved. But the instant that she was gone he realised how crushing a misfortune this would be for you, and how all-important it was to set it right. He rushed down, just as he was, in his bare feet, opened the window, sprang out into the snow, and ran down the lane, where he could see a dark figure in the moonlight. Sir George Burnwell tried to get away, but Arthur caught him, and there was a struggle between them, your lad tugging at one side of the coronet, and his opponent at the other. In the scuffle, your son struck Sir George and cut him over the eye. Then something suddenly snapped, and your son, finding that he had the coronet in his hands, rushed back, closed the window, ascended to your room, and had just observed that the coronet had been twisted in the struggle and was endeavouring to straighten it when you appeared upon the scene.”\n“Is it possible?” gasped the banker.\n“You then roused his anger by calling him names at a moment when he felt that he had deserved your warmest thanks. He could not explain the true state of affairs without betraying one who certainly deserved little enough consideration at his hands. He took the more chivalrous view, however, and preserved her secret.”\n“And that was why she shrieked and fainted when she saw the coronet,” cried Mr. Holder. “Oh, my God! what a blind fool I have been! And his asking to be allowed to go out for five minutes! The dear fellow wanted to see if the missing piece were at the scene of the struggle. How cruelly I have misjudged him!”\n“When I arrived at the house,” continued Holmes, “I at once went very carefully round it to observe if there were any traces in the snow which might help me. I knew that none had fallen since the evening before, and also that there had been a strong frost to preserve impressions. I passed along the tradesmen’s path, but found it all trampled down and indistinguishable. Just beyond it, however, at the far side of the kitchen door, a woman had stood and talked with a man, whose round impressions on one side showed that he had a wooden leg. I could even tell that they had been disturbed, for the woman had run back swiftly to the door, as was shown by the deep toe and light heel marks, while Wooden-leg had waited a little, and then had gone away. I thought at the time that this might be the maid and her sweetheart, of whom you had already spoken to me, and inquiry showed it was so. I passed round the garden without seeing anything more than random tracks, which I took to be the police; but when I got into the stable lane a very long and complex story was written in the snow in front of me.\n“There was a double line of tracks of a booted man, and a second double line which I saw with delight belonged to a man with naked feet. I was at once convinced from what you had told me that the latter was your son. The first had walked both ways, but the other had run swiftly, and as his tread was marked in places over the depression of the boot, it was obvious that he had passed after the other. I followed them up and found they led to the hall window, where Boots had worn all the snow away while waiting. Then I walked to the other end, which was a hundred yards or more down the lane. I saw where Boots had faced round, where the snow was cut up as though there had been a struggle, and, finally, where a few drops of blood had fallen, to show me that I was not mistaken. Boots had then run down the lane, and another little smudge of blood showed that it was he who had been hurt. When he came to the high road at the other end, I found that the pavement had been cleared, so there was an end to that clue.\n“On entering the house, however, I examined, as you remember, the sill and framework of the hall window with my lens, and I could at once see that someone had passed out. I could distinguish the outline of an instep where the wet foot had been placed in coming in. I was then beginning to be able to form an opinion as to what had occurred. A man had waited outside the window; someone had brought the gems; the deed had been overseen by your son; he had pursued the thief; had struggled with him; they had each tugged at the coronet, their united strength causing injuries which neither alone could have effected. He had returned with the prize, but had left a fragment in the grasp of his opponent. So far I was clear. The question now was, who was the man, and who was it brought him the coronet?\n“It is an old maxim of mine that when you have excluded the impossible, whatever remains, however improbable, must be the truth. Now, I knew that it was not you who had brought it down, so there only remained your niece and the maids. But if it were the maids, why should your son allow himself to be accused in their place? There could be no possible reason. As he loved his cousin, however, there was an excellent explanation why he should retain her secret—the more so as the secret was a disgraceful one. When I remembered that you had seen her at that window, and how she had fainted on seeing the coronet again, my conjecture became a certainty.\n“And who could it be who was her confederate? A lover evidently, for who else could outweigh the love and gratitude which she must feel to you? I knew that you went out little, and that your circle of friends was a very limited one. But among them was Sir George Burnwell. I had heard of him before as being a man of evil reputation among women. It must have been he who wore those boots and retained the missing gems. Even though he knew that Arthur had discovered him, he might still flatter himself that he was safe, for the lad could not say a word without compromising his own family.\n“Well, your own good sense will suggest what measures I took next. I went in the shape of a loafer to Sir George’s house, managed to pick up an acquaintance with his valet, learned that his master had cut his head the night before, and, finally, at the expense of six shillings, made all sure by buying a pair of his cast-off shoes. With these I journeyed down to Streatham and saw that they exactly fitted the tracks.”\n“I saw an ill-dressed vagabond in the lane yesterday evening,” said Mr. Holder.\n“Precisely. It was I. I found that I had my man, so I came home and changed my clothes. It was a delicate part which I had to play then, for I saw that a prosecution must be avoided to avert scandal, and I knew that so astute a villain would see that our hands were tied in the matter. I went and saw him. At first, of course, he denied everything. But when I gave him every particular that had occurred, he tried to bluster and took down a life-preserver from the wall. I knew my man, however, and I clapped a pistol to his head before he could strike. Then he became a little more reasonable. I told him that we would give him a price for the stones he held—£ 1000 apiece. That brought out the first signs of grief that he had shown. ‘Why, dash it all!’ said he, ‘I’ve let them go at six hundred for the three!’ I soon managed to get the address of the receiver who had them, on promising him that there would be no prosecution. Off I set to him, and after much chaffering I got our stones at £ 1000 apiece. Then I looked in upon your son, told him that all was right, and eventually got to my bed about two o’clock, after what I may call a really hard day’s work.”",

            "prefix-probing": "“For Heaven’s sake, tell me, then, what is this extraordinary mystery!” I exclaimed, my curiosity thoroughly aroused by the strange and sudden summons which had brought me to Baker Street that morning.\n\nSherlock Holmes, who had been sitting in his usual armchair, pipe in hand, looked up with a gleam of excitement in his eyes. “My dear Watson,” he said, “you are about to be introduced to one of the most singular cases that has ever come under my observation. It is a matter that involves not only a baffling crime but also a series of curious circumstances which defy all ordinary explanation.”\n\nI settled back in my chair, eager to hear the details. Holmes began to recount the story from the beginning.\n\n“It all started three days ago,” he said, “when a young woman named Violet Hunter came to me with a peculiar request. She was a governess, seeking employment, and had been offered a position at a country estate called Birlstone Manor. The lady of the house, Mrs. Rucastle, had written to her with an invitation, but the letter contained certain oddities which aroused Violet’s suspicions.”\n\nHolmes unfolded the letter and handed it to me. It was written in a neat, formal hand, but the tone was strangely cold and forbidding. The lady warned Violet against asking too many questions and hinted at some family secrets which were not to be disturbed.\n\n“Did Violet accept the position?” I asked.\n\n“Yes,” Holmes replied. “She was intrigued and decided to take the risk. But before she left, she came to me for advice, suspecting that all was not as it seemed at Birlstone Manor.”\n\nHolmes had agreed to accompany her to the estate, and it was there that the mystery deepened. The house was an old, gloomy building perched on a hill, surrounded by dense woods. The Rucastle family was reclusive and secretive, and the servants were tight-lipped and nervous.\n\n“On the first night,” Holmes continued, “Violet heard strange noises—whispers and footsteps in the corridors, and a peculiar, unearthly moaning. She confided in me that she felt watched and feared for her safety.”\n\nHolmes and I decided to investigate further. We spent the next day exploring the manor and questioning the inhabitants. Mrs. Rucastle was a stern woman, with a sharp tongue and a suspicious nature. Her husband, Mr. Rucastle, was a man of few words, and their son, John, was a sullen youth who avoided our gaze.\n\nThe servants were equally unhelpful, but one old gardener hinted at a hidden room in the house, sealed off for many years. Holmes’s keen eye caught a faint outline of a door behind a tapestry in the library.\n\nWith some effort, we managed to open the concealed door, revealing a narrow staircase leading down into darkness. We descended cautiously and found ourselves in a small, dusty chamber, filled with old furniture and cobwebs.\n\nIn the corner lay a bundle of papers and a faded photograph of a young woman who bore a striking resemblance to Violet. Holmes examined the documents carefully.\n\n“These are letters,” he said, “from a man named Robert Rucastle, who disappeared many years ago under mysterious circumstances. It seems that the family has been hiding a dark secret.”\n\nSuddenly, a scream echoed through the house. We rushed back upstairs to find Violet pale and trembling.\n\n“Someone is trying to harm me!” she cried. “I saw a shadowy figure outside my window.”\n\nHolmes sprang into action. He stationed guards around the house and set traps to catch the intruder. That night, we waited in silence.\n\nAt midnight, a figure crept through the garden, attempting to enter through the window. Holmes and I apprehended the man, who turned out to be John Rucastle.\n\nUnder questioning, John confessed that he had been trying to scare Violet away to protect the family secret. The hidden room contained evidence of his father’s criminal activities, and the family feared exposure.\n\nWith the mystery unraveled, Violet was safe, and the Rucastle family’s dark past was brought to light. Holmes’s brilliant deduction had once again triumphed over deception and danger.\n\nAs we left Birlstone Manor, I reflected on the strange events and the extraordinary mind of my friend, Sherlock Holmes, whose powers of observation and reasoning never ceased to amaze me."

To think that she should have fallen into such company, and that she should have been led astray by that scoundrel, Sir George Burnwell.\"\n\nHolmes nodded. \"She is with Sir George Burnwell, wherever he may be.\"\n\n\"And what of her?\" asked the banker anxiously.\n\n\"Her association with such a man will be her punishment,\" said Holmes. \"She will suffer in due course for the part she has played.\"\n\nThe banker bowed his head. \"I thank you again, Mr. Holmes. You have done a great service to me and to my family.\"",

Your keen observation and relentless pursuit of the truth have uncovered the deception that threatened to ruin many innocent lives.” Holmes nodded modestly, his eyes gleaming with satisfaction. “It was a matter of piecing together the smallest details, sir. The truth often lies hidden in the shadows, but with patience and careful scrutiny, it can be brought to light.” The room was filled with a sense of relief and admiration, as the mystery that had perplexed them all was finally resolved, thanks to the great detective’s unparalleled intellect."

It is pleasant to me to observe, Watson, that you have so far grasped this truth that in these little records of our cases which you have been good enough to draw up, and, I am bound to say, occasionally to embellish, you have given prominence not so much to the many causes célèbres and sensational trials in which I have figured but rather to those incidents which may have been trivial in themselves, but which have given room for those faculties of deduction and of logical synthesis which I have made my special province.”\n“And yet,” said I, smiling, “I cannot quite hold myself absolved from the charge of sensationalism which has been urged against my records.”\n“You have erred, perhaps,” he observed, taking up a glowing cinder with the tongs and lighting with it the long cherry-wood pipe which was wont to replace his clay when he was in a disputatious rather than a meditative mood—“you have erred perhaps in attempting to put colour and life into each of your statements instead of confining yourself to the task of placing upon record that severe reasoning from cause to effect which is really the only notable feature about the thing.”\n“It seems to me that I have done you full justice in the matter,” I remarked with some coldness, for I was repelled by the egotism which I had more than once observed to be a strong factor in my friend’s singular character.\n“No, it is not selfishness or conceit,” said he, answering, as was his wont, my thoughts rather than my words. “If I claim full justice for my art, it is because it is an impersonal thing—a thing beyond myself. Crime is common. Logic is rare. Therefore it is upon the logic rather than upon the crime that you should dwell. You have degraded what should have been a course of lectures into a series of tales.”\nIt was a cold morning of the early spring, and we sat after breakfast on either side of a cheery fire in the old room at Baker Street. A thick fog rolled down between the lines of dun-coloured houses, and the opposing windows loomed like dark, shapeless blurs through the heavy yellow wreaths. Our gas was lit and shone on the white cloth and glimmer of china and metal, for the table had not been cleared yet. Sherlock Holmes had been silent all the morning, dipping continuously into the advertisement columns of a succession of papers until at last, having apparently given up his search, he had emerged in no very sweet temper to lecture me upon my literary shortcomings.",

Yet, within its brief and often crude expressions, there lies a subtlety and ingenuity that can delight the discerning eye. Consider the clever play of words, the harmonious arrangement of type, and the vivid imagery that captures the imagination in a fleeting moment. These elements, though designed to sell, can also be appreciated as a form of artistic expression.\n\nHolmes leaned back in his chair, his eyes gleaming with enthusiasm. \"It is in these small details, Watson, that one finds the true essence of creativity. The artist's hand is evident not only in grand canvases or sculpted marble but also in the humble advertisement, the newspaper sketch, or the street poster. Each is a testament to human ingenuity and the desire to communicate, to persuade, and to enchant.\"\n\nI nodded thoughtfully, recalling the many times Holmes had drawn my attention to such overlooked treasures. His keen observation extended beyond the obvious, revealing layers of meaning and beauty where others saw only the mundane.\n\n\"Moreover,\" Holmes continued, \"the study of these minor arts can yield practical benefits. By analyzing the style and technique of an advertisement, one may discern the character of its creator or the intentions behind its message. This skill has served me well in my investigations, allowing me to detect forgeries, uncover hidden clues, and understand the psychology of those involved.\"\n\nHe paused, then added with a smile, \"Art, in all its forms, is a language. To master it is to gain insight into the human soul.\"\n\nAs I listened, I was reminded of the many cases we had solved through Holmes's unparalleled ability to perceive what others overlooked. His appreciation for the subtle artistry in everyday life was yet another facet of his extraordinary mind.\n\n\"Indeed,\" I remarked, \"your passion for art, even in its humblest forms, enriches your work and broadens your understanding of the world.\"\n\nHolmes nodded, his expression one of quiet satisfaction. \"Precisely, my dear Watson. It is the attention to detail, the recognition of beauty in the commonplace, that elevates the detective's craft to an art itself.\"\n\nWith that, he returned to his reading, the advertisement sheet now a source of inspiration rather than mere information. In the interplay of words and images, Holmes found a reflection of the mysteries he so loved to unravel—a reminder that even the smallest things could hold the greatest significance."

You remember that the affair of the blue carbuncle, which appeared to be a mere whim at first, developed into a serious investigation. It may be so in this case, also.”\n“Well, let us hope so.

Or the adventure of the Gloria Scott, which was a tale of old secrets and hidden pasts, rather than of any recent wrongdoing. These cases, while lacking the excitement of a murder or a theft, yet possess a charm of their own, and illustrate the power of reasoning to unravel the most intricate puzzles.\n\n\"Indeed,\" I replied, \"it is this variety which makes your work so fascinating.

I shall be happy to do anything that I can to serve you.”\nI could see that Holmes was favourably impressed by the manner and speech of his new client. He looked her over in his searching fashion, and then composed himself, with his lids drooping and his finger-tips together, to listen to her story.\n“I have been a governess for five years,” said she, “in the family of Colonel Spence Munro, but two months ago the colonel received an appointment at Halifax, in Nova Scotia, and took his children over to America with him, so that I found myself without a situation. I advertised, and I answered advertisements, but without success. At last the little money which I had saved began to run short, and I was at my wit’s end as to what I should do.\n“There is a well-known agency for governesses in the West End called Westaway’s, and there I used to call about once a week in order to see whether anything had turned up which might suit me. Westaway was the name of the founder of the business, but it is really managed by Miss Stoper. She sits in her own little office, and the ladies who are seeking employment wait in an anteroom, and are then shown in one by one, when she consults her ledgers and sees whether she has anything which would suit them.\n“Well, when I called last week I was shown into the little office as usual, but I found that Miss Stoper was not alone. A prodigiously stout man with a very smiling face and a great heavy chin which rolled down in fold upon fold over his throat sat at her elbow with a pair of glasses on his nose, looking very earnestly at the ladies who entered. As I came in he gave quite a jump in his chair and turned quickly to Miss Stoper.\n“‘That will do,’ said he; ‘I could not ask for anything better. Capital! capital!’ He seemed quite enthusiastic and rubbed his hands together in the most genial fashion. He was such a comfortable-looking man that it was quite a pleasure to look at him.\n“‘You are looking for a situation, miss?’ he asked.\n“‘Yes, sir.’\n“‘As governess?’\n“‘Yes, sir.’\n“‘And what salary do you ask?’\n“‘I had £ 4 a month in my last place with Colonel Spence Munro.’\n“‘Oh, tut, tut! sweating—rank sweating!’ he cried, throwing his fat hands out into the air like a man who is in a boiling passion. ‘How could anyone offer so pitiful a sum to a lady with such attractions and accomplishments?’\n“‘My accomplishments, sir, may be less than you imagine,’ said I. ‘A little French, a little German, music, and drawing—’\n“‘Tut, tut!’ he cried. ‘This is all quite beside the question. The point is, have you or have you not the bearing and deportment of a lady? There it is in a nutshell. If you have not, you are not fitted for the rearing of a child who may some day play a considerable part in the history of the country. But if you have, why, then, how could any gentleman ask you to condescend to accept anything under the three figures? Your salary with me, madam, would commence at £ 100 a year.’\n“You may imagine, Mr. Holmes, that to me, destitute as I was, such an offer seemed almost too good to be true. The gentleman, however, seeing perhaps the look of incredulity upon my face, opened a pocket-book and took out a note.\n“‘It is also my custom,’ said he, smiling in the most pleasant fashion until his eyes were just two little shining slits amid the white creases of his face, ‘to advance to my young ladies half their salary beforehand, so that they may meet any little expenses of their journey and their wardrobe.’\n“It seemed to me that I had never met so fascinating and so thoughtful a man. As I was already in debt to my tradesmen, the advance was a great convenience, and yet there was something unnatural about the whole transaction which made me wish to know a little more before I quite committed myself.\n“‘May I ask where you live, sir?’ said I.\n“‘Hampshire. Charming rural place. The Copper Beeches, five miles on the far side of Winchester. It is the most lovely country, my dear young lady, and the dearest old country-house.’\n“‘And my duties, sir? I should be glad to know what they would be.’\n“‘One child—one dear little romper just six years old. Oh, if you could see him killing cockroaches with a slipper! Smack! smack! smack! Three gone before you could wink!’ He leaned back in his chair and laughed his eyes into his head again.\n“I was a little startled at the nature of the child’s amusement, but the father’s laughter made me think that perhaps he was joking.\n“‘My sole duties, then,’ I asked, ‘are to take charge of a single child?’\n“‘No, no, not the sole, not the sole, my dear young lady,’ he cried. ‘Your duty would be, as I am sure your good sense would suggest, to obey any little commands my wife might give, provided always that they were such commands as a lady might with propriety obey. You see no difficulty, heh?’\n“‘I should be happy to make myself useful.’\n“‘Quite so. In dress now, for example. We are faddy people, you know—faddy but kind-hearted. If you were asked to wear any dress which we might give you, you would not object to our little whim. Heh?’\n“‘No,’ said I, considerably astonished at his words.\n“‘Or to sit here, or sit there, that would not be offensive to you?’\n“‘Oh, no.’\n“‘Or to cut your hair quite short before you come to us?’\n“I could hardly believe my ears. As you may observe, Mr. Holmes, my hair is somewhat luxuriant, and of a rather peculiar tint of chestnut. It has been considered artistic. I could not dream of sacrificing it in this offhand fashion.\n“‘I am afraid that that is quite impossible,’ said I. He had been watching me eagerly out of his small eyes, and I could see a shadow pass over his face as I spoke.\n“‘I am afraid that it is quite essential,’ said he. ‘It is a little fancy of my wife’s, and ladies’ fancies, you know, madam, ladies’ fancies must be consulted. And so you won’t cut your hair?’\n“‘No, sir, I really could not,’ I answered firmly.\n“‘Ah, very well; then that quite settles the matter. It is a pity, because in other respects you would really have done very nicely. In that case, Miss Stoper, I had best inspect a few more of your young ladies.’\n“The manageress had sat all this while busy with her papers without a word to either of us, but she glanced at me now with so much annoyance upon her face that I could not help suspecting that she had lost a handsome commission through my refusal.\n“‘Do you desire your name to be kept upon the books?’ she asked.\n“‘If you please, Miss Stoper.’\n“‘Well, really, it seems rather useless, since you refuse the most excellent offers in this fashion,’ said she sharply. ‘You can hardly expect us to exert ourselves to find another such opening for you. Good-day to you, Miss Hunter.’ She struck a gong upon the table, and I was shown out by the page.",

Her eyes, sharp and observant, missed nothing in the room, and there was a certain air of determination about her that suggested she was not one to be trifled with. As she entered, the subtle scent of lavender accompanied her, a contrast to the otherwise austere surroundings.\n\nSherlock Holmes, seated by the fire, looked up from his violin, his keen gaze immediately assessing her. Dr. Watson, ever the gentleman, rose to offer his hand, which she accepted with a firm grip.\n\n\"You must be Miss Violet Hunter,\" Holmes said, his voice calm but penetrating.\n\n\"Yes, Mr. Holmes,\" she replied, her tone steady. \"I have come to seek your assistance in a matter that has troubled me greatly.\"\n\nHolmes gestured to a chair. \"Please, sit down and tell us everything from the beginning.\"\n\nShe settled herself, smoothing the folds of her simple dress. \"I am a governess by profession, and recently I accepted a position at a country estate called Holdernesse Hall. The family is kind enough, but there have been... unsettling occurrences that I cannot explain.\"\n\nWatson leaned forward, intrigued. \"What sort of occurrences?\"\n\nMiss Hunter hesitated, then continued. \"At night, I have heard strange noises—footsteps in the corridors, whispers, and sometimes a low moaning sound. The other servants dismiss it as the wind or the creaking of the old house, but I am convinced there is more to it.\"\n\nHolmes steepled his fingers. \"Have you witnessed anything unusual during the day?\"\n\n\"Not directly,\" she answered. \"But there is a locked room on the upper floor that no one is allowed to enter. The master of the house, Mr. Rucastle, is particularly secretive about it.\"\n\n\"A locked room, you say?\" Holmes mused. \"That often indicates a secret worth hiding.\"\n\nMiss Hunter nodded. \"Indeed. I have tried to inquire about it, but my questions are met with evasive answers.\"\n\nHolmes stood and began to pace the room. \"Miss Hunter, I believe this is a case that requires immediate investigation. Watson, we must prepare to visit Holdernesse Hall at once.\"\n\nThe journey to the estate was swift, and upon arrival, the imposing structure loomed before them, its stone walls weathered by time. Mr. Rucastle greeted them with a wary smile, his eyes flickering with suspicion.\n\n\"Mr. Holmes, Dr. Watson,\" he said, his voice cordial but guarded. \"To what do I owe the pleasure?\"\n\nHolmes wasted no time. \"We have been asked to look into certain disturbances reported by Miss Hunter. I trust you will cooperate fully.\"\n\nRucastle's smile tightened. \"Of course. The house is old, and noises are to be expected.\"\n\nHolmes's gaze shifted to the upper floor. \"And the locked room?\"\n\n\"That is a private study,\" Rucastle replied quickly. \"Not for the eyes of servants or visitors.\"\n\nHolmes exchanged a glance with Watson. \"We shall see.\"\n\nThat night, Holmes and Watson took turns watching the corridors. At the stroke of midnight, a faint light flickered beneath the door of the locked room, and a shadow passed by. Holmes signaled to Watson, and they approached quietly.\n\nUsing a set of lock picks, Holmes deftly opened the door. Inside, they found a small study, cluttered with papers and books. On the desk lay a letter addressed to a Mr. John Openshaw, warning him to stay away from Holdernesse Hall.\n\nSuddenly, a noise behind them made them turn. Rucastle stood in the doorway, his face pale but resolute.\n\n\"You should not be here,\" he said. \"This is my private domain.\"\n\nHolmes stepped forward. \"We are here to uncover the truth, Mr. Rucastle.\"\n\nRucastle's shoulders sagged. \"Very well. The truth is darker than you imagine.\"\n\nHe revealed that John Openshaw was a relative who had disappeared under mysterious circumstances. The noises were the result of Rucastle's attempts to conceal a secret passage used to hide the man.\n\nWith Holmes's guidance, they discovered the passage and found John Openshaw, alive but weak, hidden away to protect him from enemies.\n\nThe mystery resolved, Miss Hunter expressed her gratitude, and Holmes once again demonstrated the power of observation and deduction.\n\nAs they departed Holdernesse Hall, Watson remarked, \"Holmes, your methods never cease to amaze me.\"\n\nHolmes smiled faintly. \"The world is full of secrets, Watson. It is our task to bring them to light.\""

After all, if these people had strange fads and expected obedience on the most extraordinary matters, they were at least ready to pay for their eccentricity. Very few governesses in England are getting £ 100 a year. Besides, what use was my hair to me? Many people are improved by wearing it short and perhaps I should be among the number. Next day I was inclined to think that I had made a mistake, and by the day after I was sure of it. I had almost overcome my pride so far as to go back to the agency and inquire whether the place was still open when I received this letter from the gentleman himself. I have it here and I will read it to you:\n“‘The Copper Beeches, near Winchester.\n“‘DEAR MISS HUNTER,—Miss Stoper has very kindly given me your address, and I write from here to ask you whether you have reconsidered your decision. My wife is very anxious that you should come, for she has been much attracted by my description of you. We are willing to give £ 30 a quarter, or £ 120 a year, so as to recompense you for any little inconvenience which our fads may cause you. They are not very exacting, after all. My wife is fond of a particular shade of electric blue and would like you to wear such a dress indoors in the morning. You need not, however, go to the expense of purchasing one, as we have one belonging to my dear daughter Alice (now in Philadelphia), which would, I should think, fit you very well. Then, as to sitting here or there, or amusing yourself in any manner indicated, that need cause you no inconvenience. As regards your hair, it is no doubt a pity, especially as I could not help remarking its beauty during our short interview, but I am afraid that I must remain firm upon this point, and I only hope that the increased salary may recompense you for the loss. Your duties, as far as the child is concerned, are very light. Now do try to come, and I shall meet you with the dog-cart at Winchester. Let me know your train. Yours faithfully,\n“‘JEPHRO RUCASTLE.’\n“That is the letter which I have just received, Mr. Holmes, and my mind is made up that I will accept it. I thought, however, that before taking the final step I should like to submit the whole matter to your consideration.”\n“Well, Miss Hunter, if your mind is made up, that settles the question,” said Holmes, smiling.\n“But you would not advise me to refuse?”\n“I confess that it is not the situation which I should like to see a sister of mine apply for.”\n“What is the meaning of it all, Mr. Holmes?”\n“Ah, I have no data. I cannot tell. Perhaps you have yourself formed some opinion?”\n“Well, there seems to me to be only one possible solution. Mr. Rucastle seemed to be a very kind, good-natured man. Is it not possible that his wife is a lunatic, that he desires to keep the matter quiet for fear she should be taken to an asylum, and that he humours her fancies in every way in order to prevent an outbreak?”\n“That is a possible solution—in fact, as matters stand, it is the most probable one. But in any case it does not seem to be a nice household for a young lady.”\n“But the money, Mr. Holmes, the money!”\n“Well, yes, of course the pay is good—too good. That is what makes me uneasy. Why should they give you £ 120 a year, when they could have their pick for £ 40? There must be some strong reason behind.”\n“I thought that if I told you the circumstances you would understand afterwards if I wanted your help. I should feel so much stronger if I felt that you were at the back of me.”\n“Oh, you may carry that feeling away with you. I assure you that your little problem promises to be the most interesting which has come my way for some months. There is something distinctly novel about some of the features. If you should find yourself in doubt or in danger—”\n“Danger! What danger do you foresee?”\nHolmes shook his head gravely. “It would cease to be a danger if we could define it,” said he. “But at any time, day or night, a telegram would bring me down to your help.”\n“That is enough.” She rose briskly from her chair with the anxiety all swept from her face. “I shall go down to Hampshire quite easy in my mind now. I shall write to Mr. Rucastle at once, sacrifice my poor hair to-night, and start for Winchester to-morrow.” With a few grateful words to Holmes she bade us both good-night and bustled off upon her way.\n“At least,” said I as we heard her quick, firm steps descending the stairs, “she seems to be a young lady who is very well able to take care of herself.”\n“And she would need to be,” said Holmes gravely. “I am much mistaken if we do not hear from her before many days are past.”",

This removes a significant structural element from the original, where the letter is presented verbatim within the narrative.\n- The transition between the character's reflections, the reading of the letter, and the subsequent conversation with Holmes is condensed, losing the clear separation and pacing found in the original.\n\n2. MISSING ELEMENTS:\n- The completion does not include the explicit mention of the character almost returning to the agency to inquire about the position before receiving the letter, which is a key step in the original sequence.\n- The specific details about the letter's address and formal greeting are omitted, as well as the closing signature, which are important for authenticity and atmosphere.\n- The original contains a moment where the character states her mind is made up but wants Holmes's opinion before taking the final step; this nuance is less clear in the completion.\n- The completion lacks the detailed exchange at the end, where the character expresses gratitude and leaves, followed by the distinct remarks from Watson and Holmes, which are more developed in the original.\n\n3. INACCURATE ELEMENTS:\n- The sequence of events is slightly altered: the completion suggests the character was about to write and accept before receiving the letter, whereas the original presents a more nuanced progression of doubt and reconsideration.\n- The summary of the letter introduces minor inaccuracies, such as the implication that the salary was increased in the letter, rather than clarified, and the conditions are paraphrased rather than listed as in the original.\n- The conversation between Holmes and the character is condensed, with some of Holmes's reservations and the character's reasoning not fully represented or sequenced as in the original.\n- The ending compresses the departure, gratitude, and the final exchange between Watson and Holmes, losing the original's pacing and the gravity of Holmes's final remark."

I had been so eager to get away from the dull routine of my life that I had not stopped to consider the consequences. But it was too late to turn back now. I had made up my mind to seek my fortune, and I was determined to see it through, come what may.\"\n\nSherlock Holmes nodded thoughtfully, his keen eyes fixed upon the young man who had just recounted his tale. \"You have taken a bold step, my friend,\" he said. \"But boldness alone is not enough. You must be cautious and observant, for the world is full of dangers and deceit.\"\n\nThe young man sighed deeply. \"I know, Mr. Holmes. I have already encountered more than I bargained for. The city is a maze of shadows and secrets, and I find myself lost within it.\"\n\nHolmes leaned forward, his fingers steepled beneath his chin. \"Tell me everything from the beginning. Every detail may be important.\"\n\nAnd so the young man began to speak once more, his voice steadying as he recounted the events that had led him to this moment. He spoke of his humble origins, the monotony of his previous employment, and the restless yearning that had driven him to seek a new life. He described the journey to London, the bustling streets, and the myriad faces that passed him by without a second glance.\n\n\"It was on the third day,\" he continued, \"that I first noticed the man who would change everything. He was a tall, thin fellow with a hawk-like nose and piercing eyes. He seemed to watch me as much as I watched him, and I felt a chill run down my spine whenever our paths crossed.\"\n\nHolmes's eyes gleamed with interest. \"Did you speak to this man?\"\n\n\"No, sir. I was too wary. But I could not shake the feeling that he was following me.\"\n\n\"And what did you do?\"\n\n\"I tried to lose him in the crowd, but he was always there, lurking in the shadows. Then, one evening, as I turned down a narrow alley, he stepped out from behind a barrel and blocked my way.\"\n\n\"What happened then?\"\n\n\"He spoke to me in a low voice, offering a proposition. He said he knew of a way to make money quickly, but it would require my discretion and courage.\"\n\nHolmes raised an eyebrow. \"And did you accept?\"\n\n\"I was tempted, but I declined. I did not want to be involved in anything illegal or dangerous.\"\n\n\"Wise decision,\" Holmes remarked. \"But tell me, did he leave you with any indication of who he was or what he wanted?\"\n\n\"Only a card with a name and an address.\"\n\nHolmes took the card and examined it closely. \"This is a curious name,\" he mused. \"It belongs to a known associate of the criminal underworld.\"\n\nThe young man looked alarmed. \"Do you think I am in danger?\"\n\n\"Possibly,\" Holmes replied. \"But fear not. With careful planning, we can uncover the truth and protect you from harm.\"\n\nOver the next few days, Holmes and his faithful companion, Dr. Watson, set about investigating the mysterious man and his connections. They visited the address on the card, a dilapidated warehouse on the edge of the city, and observed the comings and goings of shadowy figures. Holmes's keen intellect and Watson's steady presence proved invaluable as they pieced together the puzzle.\n\nOne evening, as they sat in their rooms at 221B Baker Street, Holmes shared his findings. \"The man who approached you is part of a smuggling ring that operates under the cover of darkness. They traffic in stolen goods and contraband, evading the watchful eyes of the law.\"\n\n\"But why target me?\" the young man asked.\n\n\"Because you are new to the city and appear vulnerable. They hoped to recruit you as an unwitting accomplice.\"\n\nThe young man shuddered. \"I had no idea.\"\n\nHolmes smiled reassuringly. \"Now that we know their methods, we can devise a plan to bring them to justice.\"\n\nWith Holmes's guidance, the young man agreed to act as bait, feigning interest in the smuggling operation to lure the criminals into the open. It was a dangerous gambit, but one that promised to expose the culprits and restore order.\n\nThe night of the rendezvous arrived, and the young man, accompanied by Holmes and Watson, made his way to the warehouse. The air was thick with tension as they waited in the shadows, watching for any sign of movement.\n\nSuddenly, figures emerged from the darkness, their faces obscured by scarves and hats. They approached the young man cautiously, speaking in hushed tones. Holmes and Watson stepped forward, revealing themselves and demanding the surrender of the contraband.\n\nA brief struggle ensued, but the criminals were no match for Holmes's quick thinking and Watson's strength. The police arrived shortly thereafter, alerted by a prearranged signal, and took the smugglers into custody.\n\nAs the dust settled, the young man breathed a sigh of relief. \"Thank you, Mr. Holmes. Without your help, I would have been lost.\"\n\nHolmes nodded modestly. \"It is all in a day's work. Remember, the city may be full of shadows, but with vigilance and courage, even the darkest corners can be illuminated.\"\n\nAnd so, the young man found not only safety but also a renewed sense of purpose, inspired by the wisdom and bravery of Sherlock Holmes. His adventure had begun with uncertainty and fear, but it ended with hope and the promise of a brighter future."

          "text_segment": "It was not very long before my friend’s prediction was fulfilled. A fortnight went by, during which I frequently found my thoughts turning in her direction and wondering what strange side-alley of human experience this lonely woman had strayed into. The unusual salary, the curious conditions, the light duties, all pointed to something abnormal, though whether a fad or a plot, or whether the man were a philanthropist or a villain, it was quite beyond my powers to determine. As to Holmes, I observed that he sat frequently for half an hour on end, with knitted brows and an abstracted air, but he swept the matter away with a wave of his hand when I mentioned it. “Data! data! data!” he cried impatiently. “I can’t make bricks without clay.” And yet he would always wind up by muttering that no sister of his should ever have accepted such a situation.\nThe telegram which we eventually received came late one night just as I was thinking of turning in and Holmes was settling down to one of those all-night chemical researches which he frequently indulged in, when I would leave him stooping over a retort and a test-tube at night and find him in the same position when I came down to breakfast in the morning. He opened the yellow envelope, and then, glancing at the message, threw it across to me.\n“Just look up the trains in Bradshaw,” said he, and turned back to his chemical studies.\nThe summons was a brief and urgent one.\n“Please be at the Black Swan Hotel at Winchester at midday to-morrow,” it said. “Do come! I am at my wit’s end.\n“HUNTER.”\n“Will you come with me?” asked Holmes, glancing up.\n“I should wish to.”\n“Just look it up, then.”\n“There is a train at half-past nine,” said I, glancing over my Bradshaw. “It is due at Winchester at 11:30.”\n“That will do very nicely. Then perhaps I had better postpone my analysis of the acetones, as we may need to be at our best in the morning.”\nBy eleven o’clock the next day we were well upon our way to the old English capital. Holmes had been buried in the morning papers all the way down, but after we had passed the Hampshire border he threw them down and began to admire the scenery. It was an ideal spring day, a light blue sky, flecked with little fleecy white clouds drifting across from west to east. The sun was shining very brightly, and yet there was an exhilarating nip in the air, which set an edge to a man’s energy. All over the countryside, away to the rolling hills around Aldershot, the little red and grey roofs of the farm-steadings peeped out from amid the light green of the new foliage.\n“Are they not fresh and beautiful?” I cried with all the enthusiasm of a man fresh from the fogs of Baker Street.\nBut Holmes shook his head gravely.\n“Do you know, Watson,” said he, “that it is one of the curses of a mind with a turn like mine that I must look at everything with reference to my own special subject. You look at these scattered houses, and you are impressed by their beauty. I look at them, and the only thought which comes to me is a feeling of their isolation and of the impunity with which crime may be committed there.”\n“Good heavens!” I cried. “Who would associate crime with these dear old homesteads?”\n“They always fill me with a certain horror. It is my belief, Watson, founded upon my experience, that the lowest and vilest alleys in London do not present a more dreadful record of sin than does the smiling and beautiful countryside.”\n“You horrify me!”\n“But the reason is very obvious. The pressure of public opinion can do in the town what the law cannot accomplish. There is no lane so vile that the scream of a tortured child, or the thud of a drunkard’s blow, does not beget sympathy and indignation among the neighbours, and then the whole machinery of justice is ever so close that a word of complaint can set it going, and there is but a step between the crime and the dock. But look at these lonely houses, each in its own fields, filled for the most part with poor ignorant folk who know little of the law. Think of the deeds of hellish cruelty, the hidden wickedness which may go on, year in, year out, in such places, and none the wiser. Had this lady who appeals to us for help gone to live in Winchester, I should never have had a fear for her. It is the five miles of country which makes the danger. Still, it is clear that she is not personally threatened.”\n“No. If she can come to Winchester to meet us she can get away.”\n“Quite so. She has her freedom.”\n“What can be the matter, then? Can you suggest no explanation?”\n“I have devised seven separate explanations, each of which would cover the facts as far as we know them. But which of these is correct can only be determined by the fresh information which we shall no doubt find waiting for us. Well, there is the tower of the cathedral, and we shall soon learn all that Miss Hunter has to tell.”",

Holmes, however, was deeply preoccupied, and though he refused to speculate without further data, he would occasionally mutter to himself, \"My sister would never have allowed such a thing,\" or dismiss the topic with a wave of his hand.\n\nHe spent long hours in silent contemplation, sometimes working through the night on his chemical experiments, only to be found in the same position the next morning, absorbed in thought.\n\nOne late evening, as I was preparing to retire and Holmes was beginning a chemical analysis, the telegram boy arrived.

After crossing the Hampshire border, he looked up and admired the spring scenery—the fresh green fields, the budding trees, and the distant hills.\n\nI expressed my delight at the beautiful countryside, but Holmes’s face grew grave. \"You see only the beauty,\" he said, \"but my mind is forced to see the isolation, the scattered houses, and the opportunities for crime.\"\n\nHe went on to explain that crime in the countryside is often more rampant and more hidden than in the worst alleys of London. \"In the city,\" he said, \"public opinion is a powerful force. The presence of neighbors, the watchful eyes of the community, and the proximity of the police all act as deterrents. But in the country, a crime can be committed in a lonely house, far from prying eyes, and the law is slow to reach.\"\n\n\"So the danger,\" he concluded, \"lies not in Winchester itself, but in the isolation of the country house. Yet Miss Hunter is not in immediate danger, for she can travel to meet us.\"\n\nHolmes then revealed that he had formulated seven possible explanations for the mystery but needed Miss Hunter’s account to determine which was correct.\n\nAs we approached Winchester, the cathedral tower came into view, standing tall against the sky, and I felt a growing anticipation to learn the truth from Miss Hunter herself.",
                "refinement_prompt": "IMPROVEMENT GUIDANCE:\n1. MAJOR STRUCTURAL ISSUES:\n- The completion omits the depiction of Holmes's specific behavior and mannerisms during the waiting period, such as his extended periods of silent contemplation and his physical gestures when dismissing the topic. \n- The completion condenses the exchange about the telegram and the train schedule, omitting the step-by-step dialogue and the process of consulting the timetable.\n- The detailed description of the spring countryside, including specific visual elements and the emotional contrast between Watson and Holmes, is significantly shortened.\n- The philosophical discussion about crime in the countryside versus the city is summarized rather than presented as a back-and-forth dialogue, losing the progression and depth of the original conversation.\n\n2. MISSING ELEMENTS:\n- Early in the passage, the completion lacks the narrator’s internal debate about the possible nature of the employer and the ambiguity between harmless eccentricity and potential danger.\n- The completion omits the specific mention of Holmes’s muttered comment about his own sister, which adds personal context to his concern.\n- The sequence of Holmes’s chemical research, including the detail of him working through the night and being found in the same position in the morning, is missing.\n- The completion does not include the direct quotations from the telegram or the dialogue as Holmes and Watson discuss the train times and their travel plans.\n- The vivid, sensory details of the countryside’s appearance and atmosphere, as well as the specific reference to Aldershot, are not present.\n- The completion omits the detailed reasoning Holmes gives for why the countryside is more dangerous, including the examples of how urban environments respond to crime.\n- The final anticipation of learning from Miss Hunter, as well as the specific mention of the cathedral tower, is only briefly referenced and lacks the buildup of the original.\n\n3. INACCURATE ELEMENTS:\n- The completion generalizes the time of the telegram’s arrival and the train schedule, rather than providing the sequence and timing as in the original.\n- The order of events is compressed, with some steps (such as the process of looking up the train and the discussion about Holmes postponing his analysis) being merged or summarized rather than presented in the original order.\n- The philosophical discussion about crime is presented as a summary rather than as a dialogue, which changes the dynamic and pacing of the exchange.\n- The completion attributes some reflections and reasoning to Holmes in a narrative voice rather than through direct speech, altering the perspective and immediacy of the original passage."

            "prefix-probing": "It was not very long before my friend’s prediction was fulfilled. The morning after our conversation, I received a letter sealed with a peculiar emblem—a serpent entwined around a dagger. The handwriting was elegant yet hurried, and the message was brief but urgent: \"Meet me at the old mill by the river at midnight. Your life depends on it. —A Friend.\"\n\nCuriosity and concern propelled me to the appointed place. The old mill, long abandoned and rumored to be haunted, stood silhouetted against the moonlit sky. As I approached, a shadow detached itself from the darkness. It was none other than Sherlock Holmes, his keen eyes gleaming with intensity.\n\n\"Watson,\" he whispered, \"we have a matter of utmost delicacy. A series of thefts have plagued the city, but these are no ordinary crimes. The stolen items are seemingly unrelated—an ancient manuscript, a vial of rare poison, a set of cryptic letters—but I suspect a deeper connection.\"\n\nHe handed me a small notebook filled with his meticulous notes. \"I have reason to believe these thefts are the work of a secret society, one that operates in the shadows to manipulate events for their own gain. Our task is to uncover their motives and prevent a catastrophe.\"\n\nOver the following days, Holmes and I delved into the labyrinthine underworld of London. We visited obscure bookshops, interrogated informants, and pieced together fragments of information. Each clue led us closer to the enigmatic group known as the Serpent's Fang.\n\nOne evening, as we examined a map marked with various locations, Holmes's eyes lit up. \"Watson, observe these points—they form a pattern resembling the constellation Draco. The society must be using celestial navigation to coordinate their activities.\"\n\nOur investigation took us to a clandestine meeting beneath the city, where masked figures convened to discuss their plans. We overheard talk of an impending assassination aimed at destabilizing the government. Time was of the essence.\n\nDisguised and armed with only our wits, we infiltrated the gathering. Holmes's quick thinking and my steady hand allowed us to thwart the attempt, capturing the ringleader and exposing the conspiracy.\n\nIn the aftermath, the city breathed a sigh of relief. The Serpent's Fang was dismantled, and peace restored. Yet, as Holmes remarked, \"The shadows will always harbor secrets, Watson. Our vigilance must never wane.\"\n\nThus concluded another chapter in our adventures, a testament to the enduring battle between light and darkness in the heart of London."

She had engaged a sitting-room, and our lunch awaited us upon the table.\n“I am so delighted that you have come,” she said earnestly. “It is so very kind of you both; but indeed I do not know what I should do. Your advice will be altogether invaluable to me.”\n“Pray tell us what has happened to you.”\n“I will do so, and I must be quick, for I have promised Mr. Rucastle to be back before three. I got his leave to come into town this morning, though he little knew for what purpose.”\n“Let us have everything in its due order.” Holmes thrust his long thin legs out towards the fire and composed himself to listen.\n“In the first place, I may say that I have met, on the whole, with no actual ill-treatment from Mr. and Mrs. Rucastle. It is only fair to them to say that. But I cannot understand them, and I am not easy in my mind about them.”\n“What can you not understand?”\n“Their reasons for their conduct. But you shall have it all just as it occurred. When I came down, Mr. Rucastle met me here and drove me in his dog-cart to the Copper Beeches. It is, as he said, beautifully situated, but it is not beautiful in itself, for it is a large square block of a house, whitewashed, but all stained and streaked with damp and bad weather. There are grounds round it, woods on three sides, and on the fourth a field which slopes down to the Southampton high road, which curves past about a hundred yards from the front door. This ground in front belongs to the house, but the woods all round are part of Lord Southerton’s preserves. A clump of copper beeches immediately in front of the hall door has given its name to the place.\n“I was driven over by my employer, who was as amiable as ever, and was introduced by him that evening to his wife and the child. There was no truth, Mr. Holmes, in the conjecture which seemed to us to be probable in your rooms at Baker Street. Mrs. Rucastle is not mad. I found her to be a silent, pale-faced woman, much younger than her husband, not more than thirty, I should think, while he can hardly be less than forty-five. From their conversation I have gathered that they have been married about seven years, that he was a widower, and that his only child by the first wife was the daughter who has gone to Philadelphia. Mr. Rucastle told me in private that the reason why she had left them was that she had an unreasoning aversion to her stepmother. As the daughter could not have been less than twenty, I can quite imagine that her position must have been uncomfortable with her father’s young wife.\n“Mrs. Rucastle seemed to me to be colourless in mind as well as in feature. She impressed me neither favourably nor the reverse. She was a nonentity. It was easy to see that she was passionately devoted both to her husband and to her little son. Her light grey eyes wandered continually from one to the other, noting every little want and forestalling it if possible. He was kind to her also in his bluff, boisterous fashion, and on the whole they seemed to be a happy couple. And yet she had some secret sorrow, this woman. She would often be lost in deep thought, with the saddest look upon her face. More than once I have surprised her in tears. I have thought sometimes that it was the disposition of her child which weighed upon her mind, for I have never met so utterly spoiled and so ill-natured a little creature. He is small for his age, with a head which is quite disproportionately large. His whole life appears to be spent in an alternation between savage fits of passion and gloomy intervals of sulking. Giving pain to any creature weaker than himself seems to be his one idea of amusement, and he shows quite remarkable talent in planning the capture of mice, little birds, and insects. But I would rather not talk about the creature, Mr. Holmes, and, indeed, he has little to do with my story.”\n“I am glad of all details,” remarked my friend, “whether they seem to you to be relevant or not.”\n“I shall try not to miss anything of importance. The one unpleasant thing about the house, which struck me at once, was the appearance and conduct of the servants. There are only two, a man and his wife. Toller, for that is his name, is a rough, uncouth man, with grizzled hair and whiskers, and a perpetual smell of drink. Twice since I have been with them he has been quite drunk, and yet Mr. Rucastle seemed to take no notice of it. His wife is a very tall and strong woman with a sour face, as silent as Mrs. Rucastle and much less amiable. They are a most unpleasant couple, but fortunately I spend most of my time in the nursery and my own room, which are next to each other in one corner of the building.\n“For two days after my arrival at the Copper Beeches my life was very quiet; on the third, Mrs. Rucastle came down just after breakfast and whispered something to her husband.\n“‘Oh, yes,’ said he, turning to me, ‘we are very much obliged to you, Miss Hunter, for falling in with our whims so far as to cut your hair. I assure you that it has not detracted in the tiniest iota from your appearance. We shall now see how the electric-blue dress will become you. You will find it laid out upon the bed in your room, and if you would be so good as to put it on we should both be extremely obliged.’\n“The dress which I found waiting for me was of a peculiar shade of blue. It was of excellent material, a sort of beige, but it bore unmistakable signs of having been worn before. It could not have been a better fit if I had been measured for it. Both Mr. and Mrs. Rucastle expressed a delight at the look of it, which seemed quite exaggerated in its vehemence. They were waiting for me in the drawing-room, which is a very large room, stretching along the entire front of the house, with three long windows reaching down to the floor. A chair had been placed close to the central window, with its back turned towards it. In this I was asked to sit, and then Mr. Rucastle, walking up and down on the other side of the room, began to tell me a series of the funniest stories that I have ever listened to. You cannot imagine how comical he was, and I laughed until I was quite weary. Mrs. Rucastle, however, who has evidently no sense of humour, never so much as smiled, but sat with her hands in her lap, and a sad, anxious look upon her face. After an hour or so, Mr. Rucastle suddenly remarked that it was time to commence the duties of the day, and that I might change my dress and go to little Edward in the nursery.\n“Two days later this same performance was gone through under exactly similar circumstances. Again I changed my dress, again I sat in the window, and again I laughed very heartily at the funny stories of which my employer had an immense répertoire, and which he told inimitably. Then he handed me a yellow-backed novel, and moving my chair a little sideways, that my own shadow might not fall upon the page, he begged me to read aloud to him. I read for about ten minutes, beginning in the heart of a chapter, and then suddenly, in the middle of a sentence, he ordered me to cease and to change my dress.\n“You can easily imagine, Mr. Holmes, how curious I became as to what the meaning of this extraordinary performance could possibly be. They were always very careful, I observed, to turn my face away from the window, so that I became consumed with the desire to see what was going on behind my back. At first it seemed to be impossible, but I soon devised a means. My hand-mirror had been broken, so a happy thought seized me, and I concealed a piece of the glass in my handkerchief. On the next occasion, in the midst of my laughter, I put my handkerchief up to my eyes, and was able with a little management to see all that there was behind me. I confess that I was disappointed. There was nothing. At least that was my first impression. At the second glance, however, I perceived that there was a man standing in the Southampton Road, a small bearded man in a grey suit, who seemed to be looking in my direction. The road is an important highway, and there are usually people there. This man, however, was leaning against the railings which bordered our field and was looking earnestly up. I lowered my handkerchief and glanced at Mrs. Rucastle to find her eyes fixed upon me with a most searching gaze. She said nothing, but I am convinced that she had divined that I had a mirror in my hand and had seen what was behind me. She rose at once.\n“‘Jephro,’ said she, ‘there is an impertinent fellow upon the road there who stares up at Miss Hunter.’\n“‘No friend of yours, Miss Hunter?’ he asked.\n“‘No, I know no one in these parts.’\n“‘Dear me! How very impertinent! Kindly turn round and motion to him to go away.’\n“‘Surely it would be better to take no notice.’\n“‘No, no, we should have him loitering here always. Kindly turn round and wave him away like that.’\n“I did as I was told, and at the same instant Mrs. Rucastle drew down the blind. That was a week ago, and from that time I have not sat again in the window, nor have I worn the blue dress, nor seen the man in the road.”\n“Pray continue,” said Holmes. “Your narrative promises to be a most interesting one.”\n“You will find it rather disconnected, I fear, and there may prove to be little relation between the different incidents of which I speak. On the very first day that I was at the Copper Beeches, Mr. Rucastle took me to a small outhouse which stands near the kitchen door. As we approached it I heard the sharp rattling of a chain, and the sound as of a large animal moving about.\n“‘Look in here!’ said Mr. Rucastle, showing me a slit between two planks. ‘Is he not a beauty?’\n“I looked through and was conscious of two glowing eyes, and of a vague figure huddled up in the darkness.\n“‘Don’t be frightened,’ said my employer, laughing at the start which I had given. ‘It’s only Carlo, my mastiff. I call him mine, but really old Toller, my groom, is the only man who can do anything with him. We feed him once a day, and not too much then, so that he is always as keen as mustard. Toller lets him loose every night, and God help the trespasser whom he lays his fangs upon. For goodness’ sake don’t you ever on any pretext set your foot over the threshold at night, for it’s as much as your life is worth.’\n“The warning was no idle one, for two nights later I happened to look out of my bedroom window about two o’clock in the morning. It was a beautiful moonlight night, and the lawn in front of the house was silvered over and almost as bright as day. I was standing, rapt in the peaceful beauty of the scene, when I was aware that something was moving under the shadow of the copper beeches. As it emerged into the moonshine I saw what it was. It was a giant dog, as large as a calf, tawny tinted, with hanging jowl, black muzzle, and huge projecting bones. It walked slowly across the lawn and vanished into the shadow upon the other side. That dreadful sentinel sent a chill to my heart which I do not think that any burglar could have done.\n“And now I have a very strange experience to tell you. I had, as you know, cut off my hair in London, and I had placed it in a great coil at the bottom of my trunk. One evening, after the child was in bed, I began to amuse myself by examining the furniture of my room and by rearranging my own little things. There was an old chest of drawers in the room, the two upper ones empty and open, the lower one locked. I had filled the first two with my linen, and as I had still much to pack away I was naturally annoyed at not having the use of the third drawer. It struck me that it might have been fastened by a mere oversight, so I took out my bunch of keys and tried to open it. The very first key fitted to perfection, and I drew the drawer open. There was only one thing in it, but I am sure that you would never guess what it was. It was my coil of hair.\n“I took it up and examined it. It was of the same peculiar tint, and the same thickness. But then the impossibility of the thing obtruded itself upon me. How could my hair have been locked in the drawer? With trembling hands I undid my trunk, turned out the contents, and drew from the bottom my own hair. I laid the two tresses together, and I assure you that they were identical. Was it not extraordinary? Puzzle as I would, I could make nothing at all of what it meant. I returned the strange hair to the drawer, and I said nothing of the matter to the Rucastles as I felt that I had put myself in the wrong by opening a drawer which they had locked.",

            "prefix-probing": "The Black Swan is an inn of repute in the High Street, at no distance from the station, and there we found the young lady waiting for us. She was a tall, graceful girl, with a face full of intelligence and a look of quiet determination. Her eyes, dark and expressive, met mine with a mixture of hope and apprehension. She introduced herself as Miss Violet Hunter, a governess who had recently taken up a position at a country estate but had encountered some mysterious troubles.\n\nAs we settled into a corner of the inn's cozy parlor, she began to recount the peculiar circumstances that had brought her to seek our assistance. Miss Hunter explained that she had been employed by a wealthy family at a remote manor, where she was to educate the young children. However, from the very first day, she had sensed an atmosphere of unease and secrecy within the household.\n\nShe described the family members: the stern and distant master of the house, Mr. Rucastle; his wife, a woman of cold demeanor; and their son, a man of volatile temper. There was also a mysterious lodger residing in the manor, whose presence was shrouded in secrecy and who was rarely seen by the servants or visitors.\n\nMiss Hunter recounted several incidents that had disturbed her: strange noises in the night, unexplained disappearances of household items, and a pervasive sense of being watched. She had tried to dismiss these as figments of her imagination, but the final straw came when she discovered a hidden door leading to a secret chamber within the manor.\n\nFearing for her safety and the well-being of the children under her care, she had decided to leave the estate and seek the help of the renowned detective Sherlock Holmes. She hoped that his keen intellect and powers of observation could unravel the mystery that had cast a shadow over the household.\n\nHolmes listened intently, his eyes gleaming with interest. He asked detailed questions about the layout of the manor, the habits of its inhabitants, and the nature of the strange occurrences. I could see that he was already piecing together the puzzle in his mind.\n\nAfter a brief discussion, Holmes declared that we should visit the manor at once to conduct a thorough investigation. Miss Hunter agreed, expressing relief that someone of Holmes's caliber was willing to assist her.\n\nThe journey to the manor was uneventful, but as we approached the imposing building, a sense of foreboding settled over us. The manor stood isolated amidst rolling hills, its stone walls weathered by time and its windows dark and unwelcoming.\n\nUpon arrival, we were greeted by Mr. Rucastle himself, a tall man with a stern visage and piercing eyes. He regarded us with suspicion but allowed us entry after Holmes introduced himself and explained the purpose of our visit.\n\nInside, the atmosphere was heavy with tension. The servants moved silently, avoiding our gaze, and the family members seemed reluctant to engage in conversation. Holmes began his examination, noting the peculiar arrangement of the rooms and the presence of the hidden door Miss Hunter had mentioned.\n\nHe requested to see the secret chamber, and after some hesitation, Mr. Rucastle led us to a concealed passage behind a bookshelf. The chamber was small and sparsely furnished, with signs of recent occupancy.\n\nHolmes inspected the room carefully, noting traces of soot on the floor and a faint smell of chemicals. He deduced that the chamber had been used for some clandestine purpose, possibly involving the manufacture of substances or the concealment of evidence.\n\nAs the investigation progressed, Holmes uncovered a web of deceit and intrigue. It became apparent that the mysterious lodger was involved in illicit activities, using the manor as a base for his operations. The strange noises and disappearances were linked to his secret comings and goings.\n\nHolmes confronted Mr. Rucastle with his findings, revealing that the master of the house had been complicit in the lodger's schemes, motivated by greed and the desire to maintain his social standing. The wife and son, though aware of the situation, had been powerless to intervene.\n\nWith the evidence gathered, Holmes arranged for the authorities to apprehend the lodger and Mr. Rucastle. The household's dark secrets were brought to light, and Miss Hunter was assured of her safety and the restoration of order.\n\nAs we departed the manor, Miss Hunter expressed her gratitude to Holmes and me. She was hopeful that her future would be free from the shadows that had plagued her time at the estate.\n\nThe case was a testament to Holmes's unparalleled skill in unraveling the most tangled mysteries, and it left an indelible impression on all who were involved."

          "text_segment": "“I am naturally observant, as you may have remarked, Mr. Holmes, and I soon had a pretty good plan of the whole house in my head. There was one wing, however, which appeared not to be inhabited at all. A door which faced that which led into the quarters of the Tollers opened into this suite, but it was invariably locked. One day, however, as I ascended the stair, I met Mr. Rucastle coming out through this door, his keys in his hand, and a look on his face which made him a very different person to the round, jovial man to whom I was accustomed. His cheeks were red, his brow was all crinkled with anger, and the veins stood out at his temples with passion. He locked the door and hurried past me without a word or a look.\n“This aroused my curiosity, so when I went out for a walk in the grounds with my charge, I strolled round to the side from which I could see the windows of this part of the house. There were four of them in a row, three of which were simply dirty, while the fourth was shuttered up. They were evidently all deserted. As I strolled up and down, glancing at them occasionally, Mr. Rucastle came out to me, looking as merry and jovial as ever.\n“‘Ah!’ said he, ‘you must not think me rude if I passed you without a word, my dear young lady. I was preoccupied with business matters.’\n“I assured him that I was not offended. ‘By the way,’ said I, ‘you seem to have quite a suite of spare rooms up there, and one of them has the shutters up.’\n“He looked surprised and, as it seemed to me, a little startled at my remark.\n“‘Photography is one of my hobbies,’ said he. ‘I have made my dark room up there. But, dear me! what an observant young lady we have come upon. Who would have believed it? Who would have ever believed it?’ He spoke in a jesting tone, but there was no jest in his eyes as he looked at me. I read suspicion there and annoyance, but no jest.\n“Well, Mr. Holmes, from the moment that I understood that there was something about that suite of rooms which I was not to know, I was all on fire to go over them. It was not mere curiosity, though I have my share of that. It was more a feeling of duty—a feeling that some good might come from my penetrating to this place. They talk of woman’s instinct; perhaps it was woman’s instinct which gave me that feeling. At any rate, it was there, and I was keenly on the lookout for any chance to pass the forbidden door.\n“It was only yesterday that the chance came. I may tell you that, besides Mr. Rucastle, both Toller and his wife find something to do in these deserted rooms, and I once saw him carrying a large black linen bag with him through the door. Recently he has been drinking hard, and yesterday evening he was very drunk; and when I came upstairs there was the key in the door. I have no doubt at all that he had left it there. Mr. and Mrs. Rucastle were both downstairs, and the child was with them, so that I had an admirable opportunity. I turned the key gently in the lock, opened the door, and slipped through.\n“There was a little passage in front of me, unpapered and uncarpeted, which turned at a right angle at the farther end. Round this corner were three doors in a line, the first and third of which were open. They each led into an empty room, dusty and cheerless, with two windows in the one and one in the other, so thick with dirt that the evening light glimmered dimly through them. The centre door was closed, and across the outside of it had been fastened one of the broad bars of an iron bed, padlocked at one end to a ring in the wall, and fastened at the other with stout cord. The door itself was locked as well, and the key was not there. This barricaded door corresponded clearly with the shuttered window outside, and yet I could see by the glimmer from beneath it that the room was not in darkness. Evidently there was a skylight which let in light from above. As I stood in the passage gazing at the sinister door and wondering what secret it might veil, I suddenly heard the sound of steps within the room and saw a shadow pass backward and forward against the little slit of dim light which shone out from under the door. A mad, unreasoning terror rose up in me at the sight, Mr. Holmes. My overstrung nerves failed me suddenly, and I turned and ran—ran as though some dreadful hand were behind me clutching at the skirt of my dress. I rushed down the passage, through the door, and straight into the arms of Mr. Rucastle, who was waiting outside.\n“‘So,’ said he, smiling, ‘it was you, then. I thought that it must be when I saw the door open.’\n“‘Oh, I am so frightened!’ I panted.\n“‘My dear young lady! my dear young lady!’—you cannot think how caressing and soothing his manner was—‘and what has frightened you, my dear young lady?’\n“But his voice was just a little too coaxing. He overdid it. I was keenly on my guard against him.\n“‘I was foolish enough to go into the empty wing,’ I answered. ‘But it is so lonely and eerie in this dim light that I was frightened and ran out again. Oh, it is so dreadfully still in there!’\n“‘Only that?’ said he, looking at me keenly.\n“‘Why, what did you think?’ I asked.\n“‘Why do you think that I lock this door?’\n“‘I am sure that I do not know.’\n“‘It is to keep people out who have no business there. Do you see?’ He was still smiling in the most amiable manner.\n“‘I am sure if I had known—’\n“‘Well, then, you know now. And if you ever put your foot over that threshold again’—here in an instant the smile hardened into a grin of rage, and he glared down at me with the face of a demon—‘I’ll throw you to the mastiff.’\n“I was so terrified that I do not know what I did. I suppose that I must have rushed past him into my room. I remember nothing until I found myself lying on my bed trembling all over. Then I thought of you, Mr. Holmes. I could not live there longer without some advice. I was frightened of the house, of the man, of the woman, of the servants, even of the child. They were all horrible to me. If I could only bring you down all would be well. Of course I might have fled from the house, but my curiosity was almost as strong as my fears. My mind was soon made up. I would send you a wire. I put on my hat and cloak, went down to the office, which is about half a mile from the house, and then returned, feeling very much easier. A horrible doubt came into my mind as I approached the door lest the dog might be loose, but I remembered that Toller had drunk himself into a state of insensibility that evening, and I knew that he was the only one in the household who had any influence with the savage creature, or who would venture to set him free. I slipped in in safety and lay awake half the night in my joy at the thought of seeing you. I had no difficulty in getting leave to come into Winchester this morning, but I must be back before three o’clock, for Mr. and Mrs. Rucastle are going on a visit, and will be away all the evening, so that I must look after the child. Now I have told you all my adventures, Mr. Holmes, and I should be very glad if you could tell me what it all means, and, above all, what I should do.”",

The first and third doors opened into empty, dusty rooms, but the middle door was always locked and barricaded from the inside with an iron bed-bar, which was padlocked to the wall. I also noticed that the windows of this wing were peculiar: three were dirty and one was shuttered. I connected the shuttered window with the locked door, and I thought that the light which sometimes glimmered beneath the door might come from a skylight above.\n\nOne day, I saw Mr. Rucastle himself come out of that wing looking very angry and unlike his usual jovial self. Later, when I mentioned the spare rooms and the shuttered window to him, he seemed surprised and startled. He said it was his photography darkroom, but his suspicious and annoyed look betrayed his jesting tone.\n\nFrom that moment, I felt compelled by a mixture of curiosity and a sense of duty to investigate the locked wing. I observed Toller and his wife accessing these rooms, and once I saw Toller carrying a large black bag through the door. Yesterday evening, I found Toller very drunk and the key left in the forbidden door, so I seized the opportunity while the Rucastles were downstairs.\n\nI entered the small passage and opened the first door, which led to a dusty, empty room. The third door was the same. But the middle door was locked and barricaded with the iron bed-bar, padlocked to the wall. I could see a faint glimmer of light beneath the door, which I took to be from a skylight. Suddenly, I heard footsteps inside and saw a shadow move under the door. Overcome with terror, I fled as fast as I could.\n\nI ran straight into Mr. Rucastle, who was waiting outside the door. At first, he spoke soothingly, saying, \"My dear Miss Hunter, what are you doing here?\" But his tone was too coaxing, and I was on my guard. I told him that the eerie stillness of the empty wing frightened me. He smiled amiably and said, \"Why do you think I lock that door? To keep out those who have no business there.\"\n\nHis smile suddenly hardened into a demonic glare, and he threatened, \"If ever you cross that threshold again, I will throw you to the mastiff!\" Terrified, I fled to my room.\n\nI resolved that I needed help, so I went to the telegraph office and wired to you, Mr. Holmes. I returned feeling somewhat eased, but I was momentarily afraid that the dog might be loose, remembering that Toller was incapacitated by drink and unable to control it. I obtained leave to come to Winchester, but I must return by three o'clock, as the Rucastles will be out for the evening, and I am to look after the child.\n\nAnd now, Mr. Holmes, I have told you all that I know. What does it mean, and what shall I do?",

MAJOR STRUCTURAL ISSUES:\n- The completion omits the detailed dialogue exchanges between the narrator and Mr. Rucastle after she is caught leaving the forbidden wing. The original contains several lines of direct speech that are condensed or summarized in the completion.\n- The completion does not include the narrator's internal reflections and emotional responses in as much detail as the original, particularly her feelings of terror and her subsequent actions after the confrontation.\n\n2. MISSING ELEMENTS:\n- Early in the passage, the completion leaves out the specific description of the narrator's observations about the layout and access points of the locked wing, including the relationship between the doors and the quarters of the Tollers.\n- The completion does not mention the narrator's reasoning about the connection between the shuttered window and the barricaded door, nor does it include her deduction about the presence of a skylight.\n- The narrator's emotional state and the vivid description of her panic and flight are less developed in the completion, missing the sense of overwhelming fear and the physical sensations described in the original.\n- The completion omits the narrator's detailed account of her thought process regarding sending the telegram, including her feelings about the household and her rationale for not fleeing immediately.\n- The completion does not include the narrator's mention of the need to return before a specific time due to her responsibilities, nor does it specify the arrangements for the Rucastles' absence and her duty to look after the child.\n\n3. INACCURATE ELEMENTS:\n- The sequence of events is generally preserved, but some transitions are compressed, leading to a loss of nuance in the progression from observation, to investigation, to confrontation, and finally to seeking help.\n- The completion attributes some actions and motivations in a more generalized way, such as summarizing the narrator's curiosity and sense of duty, rather than distinguishing between them as the original does.\n- The completion simplifies the description of the barricaded door and the narrator's deductions about the room's lighting, omitting the step-by-step reasoning present in the original.\n- The emotional tone of the confrontation with Mr. Rucastle is less intense, and the shift in his demeanor is not as sharply delineated as in the original passage.\n- The completion does not accurately reflect the narrator's detailed fears about the dog and her reasoning regarding Toller's condition and the dog's control."

            "prefix-probing": "I am naturally observant, as you may have remarked, Mr. Holmes, and I soon had a pretty good plan of the whole house in my head. The rooms were arranged in a rather irregular fashion, with the drawing-room and the study occupying the front of the house, and the bedrooms and servants' quarters at the back. The kitchen was situated on the ground floor, adjacent to the scullery, and there was a small garden behind the house, enclosed by a high wall.\n\nAs I moved through the rooms, I took note of the various details that might be of importance. The drawing-room was tastefully furnished, with heavy curtains and a large fireplace, above which hung a portrait of a stern-looking gentleman. The study was lined with bookshelves, filled with volumes of law and literature, and on the desk lay a number of papers, some of which appeared to be letters.\n\nI noticed that the window in the study was slightly ajar, and the latch was broken, suggesting that it might have been used as a point of entry or exit. The bedroom of the master of the house was neat and orderly, with a large four-poster bed and a wardrobe that was slightly ajar. The servants' quarters were modest but clean, and I could hear the faint sound of voices coming from the kitchen.\n\nHaving familiarized myself with the layout of the house, I returned to the drawing-room, where Mr. Holmes was seated, deep in thought. \"Well, Watson,\" he said, \"what do you make of it all?\"\n\nI recounted my observations, pointing out the broken window latch and the open wardrobe door. Holmes nodded thoughtfully. \"The broken latch is certainly suspicious. It suggests that someone may have entered or exited through the window, perhaps to avoid detection. The open wardrobe could indicate that something was hidden or removed in haste.\"\n\nJust then, the door opened, and a tall, thin man entered the room. He was dressed in a dark suit and carried himself with an air of nervous urgency. \"Mr. Holmes,\" he said, \"I am Mr. James Mortimer, the solicitor for the late Sir Charles Baskerville. I understand that you have been investigating the circumstances surrounding his death.\"\n\nHolmes rose and extended his hand. \"Indeed, Mr. Mortimer. We have been examining the house and gathering information. Please, tell us what you know.\"\n\nMr. Mortimer took a seat and began to speak. \"Sir Charles Baskerville was found dead on the grounds of his estate, under mysterious circumstances. There were no signs of a struggle, but his face bore an expression of terror. The local authorities have ruled it an accident, but I have my doubts.\"\n\nHolmes leaned forward. \"What makes you suspect foul play?\"\n\n\"There have been rumors of a curse upon the Baskerville family,\" Mr. Mortimer explained. \"An ancient legend speaks of a spectral hound that haunts the moors, bringing death to those who inherit the estate. Sir Charles was a rational man, but he was deeply troubled in the days before his death.\"\n\nHolmes smiled faintly. \"Legends and curses are often the product of superstition and fear. Our task is to uncover the truth, whatever it may be.\"\n\nAs the evening wore on, we discussed the details of the case, and I could see the keen intellect of Holmes at work, piecing together the puzzle from the fragments of evidence. The night was dark and stormy, and the moors outside the window seemed to echo the ominous tale that had brought us to this remote corner of England.\n\nThe next morning, Holmes and I set out to explore the moors, accompanied by Mr. Mortimer. The landscape was bleak and desolate, with patches of heather and gorse, and the wind howled through the hills. We visited the site where Sir Charles had been found, and Holmes examined the ground carefully.\n\n\"Notice, Watson,\" he said, \"the footprints here are peculiar. They are large and heavy, but the toes are not clearly defined. It suggests that the creature that made them was not a man, but something else.\"\n\nI shuddered at the thought, but Holmes was undeterred. \"We must keep an open mind and follow the evidence wherever it leads.\"\n\nAs we returned to the house, we encountered a local farmer who spoke of strange lights on the moors and eerie howls in the night. Holmes listened intently, his eyes gleaming with interest.\n\nThat evening, as we sat by the fire, Holmes shared his thoughts. \"The key to this mystery lies in understanding the motives of those involved. Fear and superstition can cloud judgment, but reason and observation will guide us to the truth.\"\n\nOver the following days, we delved deeper into the lives of the Baskerville family and their neighbors. We uncovered secrets and rivalries, and the shadow of the legendary hound loomed over us like a specter.\n\nOne night, as we patrolled the moors, we heard a distant baying, chilling and unnatural. Holmes raised his finger to his lips. \"Stay close, Watson. The game is afoot.\"\n\nIn the darkness, we glimpsed a large, black shape moving swiftly across the heath. Holmes fired a shot, and the creature vanished into the night. We pursued it to a rocky outcrop, where we found a man lying unconscious, clutching a revolver.\n\nIt was Stapleton, a neighbor and naturalist, who had been masquerading as a friend but was revealed to be the mastermind behind the terror. His motive was greed, seeking to inherit the Baskerville estate by eliminating the heirs.\n\nWith the mystery solved, the curse was lifted, and the Baskerville legacy was secured. Holmes and I returned to London, our minds enriched by the adventure and the triumph of reason over superstition."

          "text_segment": "Holmes and I had listened spellbound to this extraordinary story. My friend rose now and paced up and down the room, his hands in his pockets, and an expression of the most profound gravity upon his face.\n“Is Toller still drunk?” he asked.\n“Yes. I heard his wife tell Mrs. Rucastle that she could do nothing with him.”\n“That is well. And the Rucastles go out to-night?”\n“Yes.”\n“Is there a cellar with a good strong lock?”\n“Yes, the wine-cellar.”\n“You seem to me to have acted all through this matter like a very brave and sensible girl, Miss Hunter. Do you think that you could perform one more feat? I should not ask it of you if I did not think you a quite exceptional woman.”\n“I will try. What is it?”\n“We shall be at the Copper Beeches by seven o’clock, my friend and I. The Rucastles will be gone by that time, and Toller will, we hope, be incapable. There only remains Mrs. Toller, who might give the alarm. If you could send her into the cellar on some errand, and then turn the key upon her, you would facilitate matters immensely.”\n“I will do it.”\n“Excellent! We shall then look thoroughly into the affair. Of course there is only one feasible explanation. You have been brought there to personate someone, and the real person is imprisoned in this chamber. That is obvious. As to who this prisoner is, I have no doubt that it is the daughter, Miss Alice Rucastle, if I remember right, who was said to have gone to America. You were chosen, doubtless, as resembling her in height, figure, and the colour of your hair. Hers had been cut off, very possibly in some illness through which she has passed, and so, of course, yours had to be sacrificed also. By a curious chance you came upon her tresses. The man in the road was undoubtedly some friend of hers—possibly her fiancé—and no doubt, as you wore the girl’s dress and were so like her, he was convinced from your laughter, whenever he saw you, and afterwards from your gesture, that Miss Rucastle was perfectly happy, and that she no longer desired his attentions. The dog is let loose at night to prevent him from endeavouring to communicate with her. So much is fairly clear. The most serious point in the case is the disposition of the child.”\n“What on earth has that to do with it?” I ejaculated.\n“My dear Watson, you as a medical man are continually gaining light as to the tendencies of a child by the study of the parents. Don’t you see that the converse is equally valid. I have frequently gained my first real insight into the character of parents by studying their children. This child’s disposition is abnormally cruel, merely for cruelty’s sake, and whether he derives this from his smiling father, as I should suspect, or from his mother, it bodes evil for the poor girl who is in their power.”\n“I am sure that you are right, Mr. Holmes,” cried our client. “A thousand things come back to me which make me certain that you have hit it. Oh, let us lose not an instant in bringing help to this poor creature.”\n“We must be circumspect, for we are dealing with a very cunning man. We can do nothing until seven o’clock. At that hour we shall be with you, and it will not be long before we solve the mystery.”",

            "prefix-probing": "Holmes and I had listened spellbound to this extraordinary story. The narrative, delivered with a mixture of excitement and solemnity, painted a vivid picture of the events that had unfolded in the quiet village of Little Paddocks. The tale began with the mysterious disappearance of a valuable heirloom, a diamond of considerable worth, from the estate of Lady Brackenstall. The circumstances were perplexing: the diamond had vanished from a locked cabinet in a room that showed no signs of forced entry.\n\nLady Brackenstall, a woman of refined taste and considerable influence, was distraught. She had invited the local constabulary to investigate, but their efforts had yielded no clues. It was then that she turned to Sherlock Holmes, whose reputation for unraveling the most baffling mysteries was well known.\n\nHolmes, ever the keen observer, had immediately noted several peculiarities. The cabinet, though locked, bore no marks of tampering. The room was undisturbed, save for a faint trace of a peculiar scent that Holmes identified as a rare perfume. Moreover, the household staff all had alibis that seemed airtight, yet Holmes sensed that one among them was not entirely truthful.\n\nThe detective's inquiries led him to question each member of the household meticulously. The butler, a man of impeccable demeanor, claimed to have been in the kitchen during the time of the theft. The maid, young and nervous, insisted she was cleaning the west wing. The gardener, a robust fellow, stated he was tending to the greenhouse. Each account was cross-examined, and inconsistencies began to emerge.\n\nHolmes's attention was particularly drawn to the maid, whose hands bore faint traces of soil, inconsistent with her stated whereabouts. When pressed, she faltered, revealing that she had ventured into the garden to meet a suitor, a fact she had concealed out of fear of reprimand.\n\nThe detective's suspicions deepened. He deduced that the theft was an inside job, orchestrated with intimate knowledge of the household's routines. The rare perfume scent, he concluded, was a deliberate misdirection, intended to implicate an outsider.\n\nIn a masterstroke, Holmes devised a plan to catch the culprit. He arranged for a decoy diamond to be placed in the cabinet, and the household was informed of its presence. That night, hidden observers awaited the thief's move.\n\nAs the clock struck midnight, a shadowy figure crept into the room. The intruder was none other than the butler, who had exploited his access to the estate to pilfer the original diamond and replace it with a counterfeit. Confronted by Holmes, the butler confessed, revealing a motive rooted in desperation and debt.\n\nThe case concluded with the recovery of the genuine diamond and the butler's arrest. Lady Brackenstall expressed her profound gratitude to Holmes, whose brilliance had restored order to her household.\n\nAs Holmes recounted the details to me, I marveled at his unparalleled deductive powers. The adventure was a testament to his unwavering commitment to justice and his extraordinary ability to see beyond the obvious. It was, without doubt, one of the most fascinating cases we had encountered in our association."

Here are his keys, which are the duplicates of Mr. Rucastle’s.”\n“You have done well indeed!” cried Holmes with enthusiasm. “Now lead the way, and we shall soon see the end of this black business.”\nWe passed up the stair, unlocked the door, followed on down a passage, and found ourselves in front of the barricade which Miss Hunter had described. Holmes cut the cord and removed the transverse bar. Then he tried the various keys in the lock, but without success. No sound came from within, and at the silence Holmes’ face clouded over.\n“I trust that we are not too late,” said he. “I think, Miss Hunter, that we had better go in without you. Now, Watson, put your shoulder to it, and we shall see whether we cannot make our way in.”\nIt was an old rickety door and gave at once before our united strength. Together we rushed into the room. It was empty. There was no furniture save a little pallet bed, a small table, and a basketful of linen. The skylight above was open, and the prisoner gone.\n“There has been some villainy here,” said Holmes; “this beauty has guessed Miss Hunter’s intentions and has carried his victim off.”\n“But how?”\n“Through the skylight. We shall soon see how he managed it.” He swung himself up onto the roof. “Ah, yes,” he cried, “here’s the end of a long light ladder against the eaves. That is how he did it.”\n“But it is impossible,” said Miss Hunter; “the ladder was not there when the Rucastles went away.”\n“He has come back and done it. I tell you that he is a clever and dangerous man. I should not be very much surprised if this were he whose step I hear now upon the stair. I think, Watson, that it would be as well for you to have your pistol ready.”",

MAJOR STRUCTURAL ISSUES:\n- The completion omits the initial descriptive detail about the group of trees and their appearance in the setting sun, which helps set the scene and atmosphere at the start.\n- The sequence of events is generally preserved, but some transitions are condensed, such as the movement from the doorstep to inside the house, which in the original is more gradual and includes more environmental cues.\n\n2. MISSING ELEMENTS:\n- Early in the passage, the visual description of the trees and their significance in identifying the house is missing.\n- The completion does not include the specific mention of the keys being duplicates of a particular character’s, which is an important detail in the original.\n- The description of the passage and the barricade, as well as the process of unlocking and removing obstacles before reaching the door, is abbreviated.\n- The inventory of the room’s contents is less detailed, omitting some items present in the original.\n- The original contains a brief moment of concern and speculation about being too late, which is less developed in the completion.\n\n3. INACCURATE ELEMENTS:\n- There is a misattribution regarding the keys: the completion suggests they are duplicates of the Tollers’ keys, rather than another character’s, which is inaccurate.\n- The completion introduces a slightly different sequence for how Holmes attempts to reach the skylight, describing him climbing onto the bed and then a table, which is not consistent with the original sequence of actions.\n- The dialogue is sometimes altered in tone and content, with some lines of encouragement and speculation being paraphrased or changed in meaning.\n- The final warning about the approaching person is less specific in the completion, and the sense of urgency and suspicion is not as clearly directed as in the original."

            "prefix-probing": "We were as good as our word, for it was just seven when we reached the Copper Beeches, having put up our trap at a wayside public-house. The house was a large, gloomy-looking place, standing back from the road, with a high wall and a great iron gate. The windows were shuttered, and the whole place had an air of mystery and seclusion. We alighted from the trap and made our way up the gravelled drive, which was bordered by tall beeches, their branches interlacing overhead to form a dark canopy.\n\nAs we approached the door, it was opened by a tall, stern-looking woman, who eyed us with suspicion. \"Are you the people expected?\" she asked brusquely.\n\n\"Yes,\" I replied. \"We have come to see Miss Violet Hunter.\"\n\nShe nodded and led us into a large, dimly lit hall, where a fire burned low in the grate. After a moment, a young woman entered, her face pale but her eyes bright with intelligence. \"You are the visitors?\" she said, extending her hand.\n\nWe introduced ourselves, and she motioned us to sit. \"I am glad you have come,\" she said. \"I have been in a most perplexing position, and I hardly know to whom to turn.\"\n\nShe proceeded to tell us her story. She had been engaged as a governess to the two children of Mr. Rucastle, the owner of the Copper Beeches. The terms were unusual, and the conditions more so. She was required to wear a particular dress, to sit in a certain chair, and to follow strict instructions. There was a mysterious locked room in the house, and strange visitors who came and went at odd hours.\n\nMiss Hunter's curiosity and unease had grown with each passing day, and she feared that some dark secret was being concealed. She implored us to help her uncover the truth.\n\nHolmes listened intently, his keen eyes never leaving her face. \"We shall do our best,\" he said. \"But first, we must see the house and observe these peculiarities for ourselves.\"\n\nWe agreed to stay the night, and as darkness fell, the Copper Beeches seemed to grow even more sinister. The wind whispered through the trees, and shadows danced upon the walls. It was clear that this was no ordinary case, and that the night would bring revelations that none of us could have anticipated."

          "text_segment": "We were all assembled round him when the door opened, and a tall, gaunt woman entered the room.\n“Mrs. Toller!” cried Miss Hunter.\n“Yes, miss. Mr. Rucastle let me out when he came back before he went up to you. Ah, miss, it is a pity you didn’t let me know what you were planning, for I would have told you that your pains were wasted.”\n“Ha!” said Holmes, looking keenly at her. “It is clear that Mrs. Toller knows more about this matter than anyone else.”\n“Yes, sir, I do, and I am ready enough to tell what I know.”\n“Then, pray, sit down, and let us hear it for there are several points on which I must confess that I am still in the dark.”\n“I will soon make it clear to you,” said she; “and I’d have done so before now if I could ha’ got out from the cellar. If there’s police-court business over this, you’ll remember that I was the one that stood your friend, and that I was Miss Alice’s friend too.\n“She was never happy at home, Miss Alice wasn’t, from the time that her father married again. She was slighted like and had no say in anything, but it never really became bad for her until after she met Mr. Fowler at a friend’s house. As well as I could learn, Miss Alice had rights of her own by will, but she was so quiet and patient, she was, that she never said a word about them but just left everything in Mr. Rucastle’s hands. He knew he was safe with her; but when there was a chance of a husband coming forward, who would ask for all that the law would give him, then her father thought it time to put a stop on it. He wanted her to sign a paper, so that whether she married or not, he could use her money. When she wouldn’t do it, he kept on worrying her until she got brain-fever, and for six weeks was at death’s door. Then she got better at last, all worn to a shadow, and with her beautiful hair cut off; but that didn’t make no change in her young man, and he stuck to her as true as man could be.”\n“Ah,” said Holmes, “I think that what you have been good enough to tell us makes the matter fairly clear, and that I can deduce all that remains. Mr. Rucastle then, I presume, took to this system of imprisonment?”\n“Yes, sir.”\n“And brought Miss Hunter down from London in order to get rid of the disagreeable persistence of Mr. Fowler.”\n“That was it, sir.”\n“But Mr. Fowler being a persevering man, as a good seaman should be, blockaded the house, and having met you succeeded by certain arguments, metallic or otherwise, in convincing you that your interests were the same as his.”\n“Mr. Fowler was a very kind-spoken, free-handed gentleman,” said Mrs. Toller serenely.\n“And in this way he managed that your good man should have no want of drink, and that a ladder should be ready at the moment when your master had gone out.”\n“You have it, sir, just as it happened.”\n“I am sure we owe you an apology, Mrs. Toller,” said Holmes, “for you have certainly cleared up everything which puzzled us. And here comes the country surgeon and Mrs. Rucastle, so I think, Watson, that we had best escort Miss Hunter back to Winchester, as it seems to me that our locus standi now is rather a questionable one.”\nAnd thus was solved the mystery of the sinister house with the copper beeches in front of the door. Mr. Rucastle survived, but was always a broken man, kept alive solely through the care of his devoted wife. They still live with their old servants, who probably know so much of Rucastle’s past life that he finds it difficult to part from them. Mr. Fowler and Miss Rucastle were married, by special license, in Southampton the day after their flight, and he is now the holder of a government appointment in the island of Mauritius. As to Miss Violet Hunter, my friend Holmes, rather to my disappointment, manifested no further interest in her when once she had ceased to be the centre of one of his problems, and she is now the head of a private school at Walsall, where I believe that she has met with considerable success.",

            "prefix-probing": "We were all assembled round him when the door opened, and a tall, gaunt woman entered the room. Her eyes were keen and searching, and there was a certain air of authority about her that immediately commanded attention. Sherlock Holmes looked up from the papers he was examining and gave a slight nod of recognition.\n\n\"Mrs. Hudson,\" he said, \"I was just discussing the particulars of our latest case.\"\n\nThe woman nodded curtly and approached the table where Holmes was seated. \"There is a visitor waiting for you downstairs,\" she said. \"He insists on seeing you immediately.\"\n\nHolmes raised an eyebrow. \"A visitor at this hour? Very well, Mrs. Hudson. Show him up.\"\n\nMoments later, a man entered the room. He was middle-aged, with a weather-beaten face and eyes that betrayed a deep anxiety. He introduced himself as Mr. James Mortimer, a country gentleman from the West Country.\n\n\"Mr. Holmes,\" he began, \"I have come to seek your assistance in a matter that has troubled me greatly.\"\n\nHolmes gestured for him to sit and listened intently as Mortimer recounted the strange events that had befallen him. It seemed that a mysterious hound had been terrorizing the countryside near his estate, leaving behind a trail of fear and superstition among the local populace.\n\n\"A spectral hound, you say?\" Holmes mused. \"This sounds like a case worthy of investigation.\"\n\nMortimer nodded. \"Indeed, sir. The locals speak of a curse that haunts my family, and I fear that there may be some truth to their tales.\"\n\nHolmes leaned forward, his eyes gleaming with interest. \"Tell me everything from the beginning.\"\n\nAs Mortimer spoke, Holmes took meticulous notes, his mind already piecing together the fragments of the mystery. The case promised to be both challenging and intriguing, and I could see the familiar spark of excitement in Holmes's eyes.\n\nAfter Mortimer had finished, Holmes stood and began to pace the room. \"We must visit your estate at once,\" he declared. \"There is no time to lose if we are to uncover the truth behind this hound.\"\n\nI volunteered to accompany Holmes and Mortimer, eager to witness the investigation firsthand. We made arrangements to depart the following morning, and I spent the evening preparing for the journey ahead.\n\nThe next day, we traveled by carriage through the misty countryside, the landscape growing increasingly wild and desolate as we approached Mortimer's estate. Upon arrival, we were greeted by a somber household, the atmosphere heavy with unease.\n\nHolmes immediately set about examining the grounds, his keen eyes searching for any clues that might shed light on the mystery. He questioned the servants and local villagers, gathering information with his usual thoroughness.\n\nAs night fell, we gathered in the drawing-room, the fire casting flickering shadows on the walls. Mortimer recounted the latest sightings of the hound, describing its terrifying appearance and the dreadful howls that echoed through the night.\n\nHolmes listened carefully, then turned to me. \"Watson, I believe we are dealing with a case that blends superstition with human cunning. There is more to this hound than meets the eye.\"\n\nOver the following days, Holmes conducted a series of investigations, exploring the moors and examining the evidence. He uncovered footprints, strange markings, and signs of a struggle, each clue bringing us closer to the truth.\n\nOne evening, as we sat by the fire, Holmes shared his deductions. \"The hound is a creature of flesh and blood, not a supernatural apparition. Someone is using the legend to mask their own nefarious activities.\"\n\nOur suspicions soon focused on a rival family with a longstanding feud against Mortimer's. Holmes devised a plan to lure the perpetrator into the open, using the legend of the hound as bait.\n\nThe trap was set on a moonlit night, and we waited in silence, hidden among the shadows. Suddenly, a figure emerged, cloaked and moving stealthily across the moor. The chase was on, and the mystery of the hound was about to be unraveled.\n\nIn the end, Holmes's brilliance prevailed. The hound was revealed to be a trained dog, painted and equipped to appear monstrous, used by the rival family to terrorize Mortimer and seize his lands.\n\nJustice was served, and peace returned to the countryside. As we departed, Mortimer expressed his profound gratitude to Holmes and me.\n\n\"I shall never forget your aid in this dark time,\" he said. \"You have brought light where there was only fear.\"\n\nHolmes smiled modestly. \"It is the work we do, Mr. Mortimer. The truth is always worth pursuing.\"\n\nAs we journeyed back to London, I reflected on the case and the enduring power of reason over superstition. It was another testament to the extraordinary mind of Sherlock Holmes, whose dedication to uncovering the truth never wavered."
