It is true that you have acted in a most inconsiderate fashion in coming here at this hour of the morning, for I had some pressing business of my own to attend to; but you have at least had the courtesy to knock.\" \"I was not aware that you were engaged.\" \"It is not very polite, is it, to break into a gentleman's rooms?\" he remarked with a mischievous twinkle in his eyes. \"But, after all, the matter is of no great importance now, for, having seen you, I can no longer pretend that I am not at home. You are just in time to assist me in a very intricate affair. Perhaps you may care to glance over it, Watson.\" He threw a sheet of pink-tinted notepaper, which had been lying upon the table, to me, and I read as follows:",

'When you have eliminated the impossible, whatever remains, however improbable, must be the truth,' he would say, and the steps by which he reached this truth, once stated, seemed so simple, so inevitable, that I felt I could have arrived at the same conclusion myself. Yet, while he was actually performing the feat, I was always in a fog. His quick, incisive mind leaped from point to point with a rapidity which left me breathless. He saw a long series of inferences where I could only see a confused and disconnected chain of events. It was like watching a conjurer; the trick is incomprehensible until the secret is revealed, and then it seems absurdly simple. But the skill, the years of training, the peculiar turn of mind that enables one to see the hidden links – these were what I admired and despaired of emulating. He would pick up a hat, a walking-stick, a pair of boots, and from them weave a whole history of their owner, a history that invariably proved to be accurate. It was not guesswork, but a rigorous application of logic to observed facts, facts that were open to anyone, yet which only he had the faculty to interpret correctly. His methods were a perpetual source of wonder to me, a blend of scientific precision and intuitive genius that set him apart from all other men I had ever known. He made the most complex problems appear elementary once he had unravelled them, leaving me to marvel at the blindness which had prevented me from seeing what was, in retrospect, so obvious."

Then there was a loud and authoritative tap. \"Come in!\" said Holmes. A man entered who could hardly have been less than six feet six inches in height, with the chest and limbs of a Hercules. His dress was rich with a richness which would, in England, be looked upon as akin to bad taste. Heavy bands of astrakhan were slashed across the sleeves and fronts of a double-breasted coat, while the deep blue cloak which was thrown over his shoulders was lined with flame-coloured silk and secured at the neck with a brooch which consisted of a single flaming beryl. Boots which extended halfway up his calves, and which were trimmed at the tops with rich brown fur, completed the impression of barbaric opulence. He carried a broad-brimmed hat in his hand, while he wore across the upper part of his face, extending down past the cheekbones, a black vizard mask, which he had apparently adjusted that very instant, for his hand was still raised to it as he entered. From the lower part of the face he appeared to be a man of strong character, with a thick, projecting lip, and a square, powerful chin. A slight frown gathered between his bushy eyebrows, and his eyes were bright and piercing. He glanced swiftly over us, and then, walking up to the fireplace, he struck the mantelpiece with his clenched fist. \"So you are Mr. Sherlock Holmes?\" he said. \"I am,\" said my companion, and this is my friend and partner, Dr. Watson, before whom you can speak as freely as before myself.

We heard a deep sigh, as of a man gathering himself for some ordeal, and then a hesitant fumbling with the handle. It was not the sharp, confident rap of a casual caller, nor the brisk, professional knock of a tradesman. This was the approach of someone burdened, perhaps apprehensive, certainly not at ease. Holmes laid down his pipe upon the table and leaned forward, his keen eyes fixed upon the door with that peculiar intensity which marked his anticipation of a new problem. I, too, felt the familiar quickening of the pulse, the sense of impending drama that always accompanied the arrival of one of Holmes's clients. The handle turned slowly, and the door swung inwards, revealing a figure that filled the frame. He was a man of considerable size, broad-shouldered and tall, though his posture was stooped, as if carrying an invisible weight. His face, framed by a thick, greying beard, was deeply lined, etched with care and, I thought, a profound sadness. His eyes, large and brown, held a look of weary resignation, yet flickered with a desperate hope as they fell upon Holmes. He wore a heavy, dark overcoat, despite the mildness of the day, and clutched a worn felt hat in his large, gloved hands. There was a certain air of faded respectability about him; his clothes, though good quality originally, were now threadbare in places and showed signs of long wear. He hesitated on the threshold, seemingly reluctant to intrude, his gaze sweeping nervously around the room before settling once more on my companion. Holmes rose smoothly from his chair, offering a gesture of welcome. \"Pray step in, sir,\" he said, his voice calm and inviting. \"The weather is sharp, and a warm room is a poor thing to stand outside of.\" The man nodded slowly, as if the simple act required effort, and shuffled into the room, closing the door softly behind him. He stood for a moment just inside, looking lost and uncertain, his hat turning slowly in his hands. \"Mr. Sherlock Holmes?\" he asked, his voice a low rumble, thick with emotion. \"I am he,\" replied Holmes. \"And this is my friend and colleague, Dr. Watson. Pray be seated, sir. You have the air of a man with a story to tell, and I have the leisure to listen.\""

Your Majesty, as I understand, became entangled with this young person, wrote her some compromising letters, and is now desirous of getting them back.”\n\n“Precisely so. But how—”\n\n“Was there a secret marriage?”\n\n“None.”\n\n“No legal papers or documents?”\n\n“None.”\n\n“Then I fail to follow your Majesty. If this young person should produce her letters for blackmail purposes, how is she to prove their authenticity?”\n\n“There is the King’s private note-paper and seal.”\n\n“But she might have obtained them in many ways.”\n\n“There is my photograph upon the paper.”\n\n“Oh, dear! Oh, dear! That is very bad! Your Majesty has indeed committed an indiscretion.”\n```",

The name is no doubt familiar to my readers. I had seen her several times in opera in London; and had heard too of her remarkable beauty and her commanding personality. She was a woman of great spirit and fire, with a face that a man might die for. It was in Warsaw that she formed a liaison with the then hereditary Prince of Bohemia, the present King. The intimacy was a very close one, and for some time it was thought that there was a possibility of their marriage. It was not to be. The Prince was of a different station, and his family would never have countenanced such a union. When, however, he abandoned her, she obtained possession of a photograph, a group photograph, of herself and the Prince. This is the document which he is so anxious to obtain. He is about to be married to the second daughter of the King of Scandinavia, and the alliance is one of the highest importance"

The landlady informed me that he had left the house shortly after eight o’clock in the morning, but had not stated where he was going. I sat down by the fire, however, with the intention of awaiting him, however long he might be. I was anxious to hear what had happened in the interview, and to learn whether he had been more fortunate in his researches than I had myself. I had no doubt that his trained faculties would see so much more than I could do in the same facts, and I confess that I was impatient to see the result.\n\nFor in my eyes Holmes was by far the greatest man of action of my acquaintance. It is true that the papers were sometimes filled with references to his success at this or that case. It is true that he was occasionally called in to consult by the French police upon cases which had baffled them. But with the exception of the case of the Sholto murder and of the Agra treasure, I had seldom heard him speak of the details of his work. I was his biographer, it is true, and I had hoped by placing on record his methods to interest the public in this most remarkable man. But I had to confess that I had failed to do so. I had not been able to interest the public in him. I had not been able to make them see him as he was. I had not been able to make them feel as I did that he was the greatest man in the world.\n\nI had often marvelled at the way in which he could pick up a clue which I had missed, and follow it up with a persistence which I could not emulate. I had often marvelled at the way in which he could see through a case which had baffled me, and lay bare the hidden springs of action which I had not been able to discover.

The landlady informed me that he had left the house shortly after eight o’clock in the morning, but had not stated where he was going. I sat down by the fire, however, with the intention of awaiting him, however long he might be. I was anxious to hear what had happened in the interview, and to learn whether he had been more fortunate in his researches than I had myself. I had no doubt that his trained faculties would see so much more than I could do in the same facts, and I confess that I was impatient to see the result.\n\nFor in my eyes Holmes was by far the greatest man of action of my acquaintance. It is true that the papers were sometimes filled with references to his success at this or that case. It is true that he was occasionally called in to consult by the French police upon cases which had baffled them. But with the exception of the case of the Sholto murder and of the Agra treasure, I had seldom heard him speak of the details of his work. I was his biographer, it is true, and I had hoped by placing on record his methods to interest the public in this most remarkable man. But I had to confess that I had failed to do so. I had not been able to interest the public in him. I had not been able to make them see him as he was. I had not been able to make them feel as I did that he was the greatest man in the world.\n\nI had often marvelled at the way in which he could pick up a clue which I had missed, and follow it up with a persistence which I could not emulate. I had often marvelled at the way in which he could see through a case which had baffled me, and lay bare the hidden springs of action which I had not been able to discover.

He was a lawyer. That sounded ominous. What was the relation between them, and what the object of his repeated visits? Was she his client, his friend, or his mistress? If the former, she had probably transferred the photograph to his keeping. If the latter, it was less likely.

          "text_segment": "“I am following you closely,” I answered.\n“I was still balancing the matter in my mind when a hansom cab drove up to Briony Lodge, and a gentleman sprang out. He was a remarkably handsome man, dark, aquiline, and moustached—evidently the man of whom I had heard. He appeared to be in a great hurry, shouted to the cabman to wait, and brushed past the maid who opened the door with the air of a man who was thoroughly at home.\n“He was in the house about half an hour, and I could catch glimpses of him in the windows of the sitting-room, pacing up and down, talking excitedly, and waving his arms. Of her I could see nothing. Presently he emerged, looking even more flurried than before. As he stepped up to the cab, he pulled a gold watch from his pocket and looked at it earnestly, ‘Drive like the devil,’ he shouted, ‘first to Gross & Hankey’s in Regent Street, and then to the Church of St. Monica in the Edgeware Road. Half a guinea if you do it in twenty minutes!’\n“Away they went, and I was just wondering whether I should not do well to follow them when up the lane came a neat little landau, the coachman with his coat only half-buttoned, and his tie under his ear, while all the tags of his harness were sticking out of the buckles. It hadn’t pulled up before she shot out of the hall door and into it. I only caught a glimpse of her at the moment, but she was a lovely woman, with a face that a man might die for.\n“‘The Church of St. Monica, John,’ she cried, ‘and half a sovereign if you reach it in twenty minutes.’\n“This was quite too good to lose, Watson. I was just balancing whether I should run for it, or whether I should perch behind her landau when a cab came through the street. The driver looked twice at such a shabby fare, but I jumped in before he could object. ‘The Church of St. Monica,’ said I, ‘and half a sovereign if you reach it in twenty minutes.’ It was twenty-five minutes to twelve, and of course it was clear enough what was in the wind.\n“My cabby drove fast. I don’t think I ever drove faster, but the others were there before us. The cab and the landau with their steaming horses were in front of the door when I arrived. I paid the man and hurried into the church. There was not a soul there save the two whom I had followed and a surpliced clergyman, who seemed to be expostulating with them. They were all three standing in a knot in front of the altar. I lounged up the side aisle like any other idler who has dropped into a church. Suddenly, to my surprise, the three at the altar faced round to me, and Godfrey Norton came running as hard as he could towards me.\n“‘Thank God,’ he cried. ‘You’ll do. Come! Come!’\n“‘What then?’ I asked.\n“‘Come, man, come, only three minutes, or it won’t be legal.’\n“I was half-dragged up to the altar, and before I knew where I was I found myself mumbling responses which were whispered in my ear, and vouching for things of which I knew nothing, and generally assisting in the secure tying up of Irene Adler, spinster, to Godfrey Norton, bachelor. It was all done in an instant, and there was the gentleman thanking me on the one side and the lady on the other, while the clergyman beamed on me in front. It was the most preposterous position in which I ever found myself in my life, and it was the thought of it that started me laughing just now. It seems that there had been some informality about their license, that the clergyman absolutely refused to marry them without a witness of some sort, and that my lucky appearance saved the bridegroom from having to sally out into the streets in search of a best man. The bride gave me a sovereign, and I mean to wear it on my watch chain in memory of the occasion.”",

There will probably be some small unpleasantness. Do not join in it. It will end in my being conveyed into the house. Four or five minutes afterwards the sitting-room window will open. You are to station yourself close to that open window.”\n“Yes.”\n“You are to watch me, for I will be visible to you.”\n“Yes.”\n“And when I raise my hand—so—you will throw into the room what I give you to throw, and will, at the same time, raise the cry of fire. You quite follow me?”\n“Entirely.”\n“It is nothing very formidable,” he said, taking a long cigar-shaped roll from his pocket. “It is an ordinary plumber’s smoke-rocket, fitted with a cap at either end to make it self-lighting. Your task is confined to that. When you raise your cry of fire, it will be taken up by quite a number of people. You may then walk to the end of the street, and I will rejoin you in ten minutes. I hope that I have made myself clear?”\n“I am to remain neutral, to get near the window, to watch you, and at the signal to throw in this object, then to raise the cry of fire, and to wait you at the corner of the street.”\n“Precisely.”\n“Then you may entirely rely on me.”",

His broad black hat, his baggy trousers, his white tie, his sympathetic smile, and general look of peering and benevolent curiosity were such as Mr. John Hare alone could have equalled. It was not merely that Holmes changed his costume. His expression, his manner, his very soul seemed to vary with every fresh part that he assumed. The stage lost a fine actor, even as science lost an acute reasoner, when he became a specialist in crime.\nIt was a quarter past six when we left Baker Street, and it still wanted ten minutes to the hour when we found ourselves in Serpentine Avenue. It was already dusk, and the lamps were just being lighted as we paced up and down in front of Briony Lodge, waiting for the coming of its occupant. The house was just such as I had pictured it from Sherlock Holmes’ succinct description, but the locality appeared to be less private than I expected. On the contrary, for a small street in a quiet neighbourhood, it was remarkably animated. There was a group of shabbily dressed men smoking and laughing in a corner, a scissors-grinder with his wheel, two guardsmen who were flirting with a nurse-girl, and several well-dressed young men who were lounging up and down with cigars in their mouths.\n“You see,” remarked Holmes, as we paced to and fro in front of the house, “this marriage rather simplifies matters. The photograph becomes a double-edged weapon now. The chances are that she would be as averse to its being seen by Mr. Godfrey Norton, as our client is to its coming to the eyes of his princess. Now the question is, Where are we to find the photograph?”\n“Where, indeed?”\n“It is most unlikely that she carries it about with her. It is cabinet size. Too large for easy concealment about a woman’s dress. She knows that the King is capable of having her waylaid and searched. Two attempts of the sort have already been made. We may take it, then, that she does not carry it about with her.”\n“Where, then?”\n“Her banker or her lawyer. There is that double possibility. But I am inclined to think neither. Women are naturally secretive, and they like to do their own secreting. Why should she hand it over to anyone else? She could trust her own guardianship, but she could not tell what indirect or political influence might be brought to bear upon a business man. Besides, remember that she had resolved to use it within a few days. It must be where she can lay her hands upon it. It must be in her own house.”\n“But it has twice been burgled.”\n“Pshaw! They did not know how to look.”\n“But how will you look?”\n“I will not look.”\n“What then?”\n“I will get her to show me.”\n“But she will refuse.”\n“She will not be able to. But I hear the rumble of wheels. It is her carriage. Now carry out my orders to the letter.”",

A blow was struck, and in an instant the lady, who had stepped from her carriage, was the centre of a little knot of flushed and struggling men, who struck savagely at each other with their fists and sticks. Holmes dashed into the crowd to protect the lady; but, just as he reached her, he gave a cry and dropped to the ground, with the blood running freely down his face. At his fall the guardsmen took to their heels in one direction and the loungers in the other, while a number of better dressed people, who had watched the scuffle without taking part in it, crowded in to help the lady and to attend to the injured man.

They were a gang, and a rough one, too. Ah, he’s breathing now.”\n“He can’t lie in the street. May we bring him in, marm?”\n“Surely. Bring him into the sitting-room. There is a comfortable sofa. This way, please!”\nSlowly and solemnly he was borne into Briony Lodge and laid out in the principal room, while I still observed the proceedings from my post by the window. The lamps had been lit, but the blinds had not been drawn, so that I could see Holmes as he lay upon the couch. I do not know whether he was seized with compunction at that moment for the part he was playing, but I know that I never felt more heartily ashamed of myself in my life than when I saw the beautiful creature against whom I was conspiring, or the grace and kindliness with which she waited upon the injured man. And yet it would be the blackest treachery to Holmes to draw back now from the part which he had intrusted to me. I hardened my heart, and took the smoke-rocket from under my ulster. After all, I thought, we are not injuring her. We are but preventing her from injuring another.\nHolmes had sat up upon the couch, and I saw him motion like a man who is in need of air. A maid rushed across and threw open the window. At the same instant I saw him raise his hand and at the signal I tossed my rocket into the room with a cry of “Fire!” The word was no sooner out of my mouth than the whole crowd of spectators, well dressed and ill—gentlemen, ostlers, and servant maids—joined in a general shriek of “Fire!” Thick clouds of smoke curled through the room and out at the open window. I caught a glimpse of rushing figures, and a moment later the voice of Holmes from within assuring them that it was a false alarm. Slipping through the shouting crowd I made my way to the corner of the street, and in ten minutes was rejoiced to find my friend’s arm in mine, and to get away from the scene of uproar.",

It is all right.”\n“You have the photograph?”\n“I know where it is.”\n“And how did you find out?”\n“She showed me, as I told you she would.”\n“I am still in the dark.”\n“I do not wish to make a mystery,” said he, laughing. “The matter was perfectly simple. You, of course, saw that everyone in the street was an accomplice. They were all engaged for the evening.”\n“I guessed as much.”\n“Then, when the row broke out, I had a little moist red paint in the palm of my hand. I rushed forward, fell down, clapped my hand to my face, and became a piteous spectacle. It is an old trick.”\n“That also I could fathom.”\n“Then they carried me in. She was bound to have me in. What else could she do? And into her sitting-room, which was the very room which I suspected. It lay between that and her bedroom, and I was determined to see which. They laid me on a couch, I motioned for air, they were compelled to open the window, and you had your chance.”\n“How did that help you?”\n“It was all-important. When a woman thinks that her house is on fire, her instinct is at once to rush to the thing which she values most. It is a perfectly overpowering impulse, and I have more than once taken advantage of it. In the case of the Darlington Substitution Scandal it was of use to me, and also in the Arnsworth Castle business. A married woman grabs at her baby; an unmarried one reaches for her jewel-box. Now it was clear to me that our lady of to-day had nothing in the house more precious to her than what we are in quest of. She would rush to secure it. The alarm of fire was admirably done. The smoke and shouting were enough to shake nerves of steel. She responded beautifully. The photograph is in a recess behind a sliding panel just above the right bell-pull. She was there in an instant, and I caught a glimpse of it as she half drew it out. When I cried out that it was a false alarm, she replaced it, glanced at the rocket, rushed from the room, and I have not seen her since. I rose, and, making my excuses, escaped from the house. I hesitated whether to attempt to secure the photograph at once; but the coachman had come in, and as he was watching me narrowly, it seemed safer to wait. A little over-precipitance may ruin all.”\n“And now?” I asked.\n“Our quest is practically finished. I shall call with the King to-morrow, and with you, if you care to come with us. We will be shown into the sitting-room to wait for the lady, but it is probable that when she comes she may find neither us nor the photograph. It might be a satisfaction to his Majesty to regain it with his own hands.”\n“And when will you call?”\n“At eight in the morning. She will not be up, so that we shall have a clear field. Besides, we must be prompt, for this marriage may mean a complete change in her life and habits. I must wire to the King without delay.”",

MAJOR STRUCTURAL ISSUES:\n- The completion invents a lengthy and repetitive sequence of following the woman through various locations, including shops, back rooms, and houses, which does not occur in the original passage. This invented pursuit replaces the actual explanation of the events that took place inside the house.\n- The completion omits the original's detailed recounting of the ruse involving the paint, the staged injury, and the subsequent actions that led to the discovery of the photograph's location.\n- The ending of the completion is cut off and does not include the original's discussion about the plan for the following morning, the involvement of the King, or the urgency due to the impending marriage.\n\n2. MISSING ELEMENTS:\n- The completion lacks the original's step-by-step breakdown of the trick used to gain access to the sitting-room and the logic behind the actions taken during the fire alarm.\n- There is no mention of the accomplices in the street, the use of red paint, or the specific actions that allowed the narrator to observe the hiding place of the photograph.\n- The completion does not include the reasoning about a woman's instinct during a fire alarm, nor the references to previous cases that illustrate this behavioral insight.\n- The plan for retrieving the photograph, including the timing and the rationale for acting promptly, is missing.\n\n3. INACCURATE ELEMENTS:\n- The completion inaccurately describes the sequence of events, suggesting a prolonged and repeated pursuit through multiple locations, which is not present in the original.\n- The dialogue is altered, with some lines misattributed or changed in meaning, and the logical flow of the conversation is disrupted.\n- The completion introduces invented reflections and actions, such as the repeated following and the woman's behavior, which do not align with the original narrative.\n- The timing and context for the planned retrieval of the photograph are not accurately represented, and the urgency related to the marriage is omitted."

            "prefix-probing": "He walked swiftly and in silence for some few minutes until we had turned down one of the quiet streets which lead towards the Edgeware Road. The lamps were already lit, casting long, distorted shadows that danced ahead of us on the damp pavement. A thin, cold drizzle had begun to fall, clinging to our coats and adding a melancholy sheen to the deserted thoroughfare. Holmes seemed oblivious to the weather, his long strides carrying him forward with an air of intense preoccupation. His brow was furrowed, and his eyes, usually so keen and restless, were fixed upon some inward vision. I knew better than to interrupt him when he was in such a mood; his mind was clearly grappling with some intricate problem, perhaps one of the many that found their way to our rooms at Baker Street, or perhaps some private speculation of his own. We passed rows of respectable, if somewhat monotonous, houses, each with its small patch of garden struggling against the encroaching urban gloom. The silence between us was broken only by the rhythmic tap of our boots and the distant rumble of traffic from the main road. Suddenly, Holmes stopped dead. I nearly collided with him, startled by the abrupt halt. He stood for a moment, head cocked, listening intently. I heard nothing but the gentle patter of rain and the faint hum of the city. “Do you hear it, Watson?” he murmured, his voice low and urgent. I strained my ears. “Hear what, Holmes? I confess I detect nothing out of the ordinary.” He gave a short, impatient sigh. “The dog, Watson. The hound. Listen!” I listened again, more carefully this time. And then I heard it – a low, mournful baying, coming from somewhere ahead of us, down one of the side streets. It was a sound that sent a shiver down my spine, full of a primal, unsettling sorrow. “A large animal,” Holmes observed, stating the obvious with unnecessary precision. “And in distress, or perhaps expressing profound loneliness. That is no casual bark, Watson. There is a story behind that sound.” He began to walk again, but now his pace was different – slower, more deliberate, his head turning from side to side as he tried to pinpoint the source of the sound. His eyes scanned the houses, the gateways, the very air itself, as if seeking some invisible clue. “It seems to be coming from that direction,” he said, pointing down a narrow, unlit lane that branched off to our left. The lane was dark and forbidding, lined with high walls that seemed to absorb the faint light from the street lamps. A sense of unease settled upon me. “Should we investigate, Holmes?” I asked, perhaps a little hesitantly. He turned to me, a flicker of that familiar, eager light in his eyes. “My dear Watson, when has a mystery, however small, ever failed to pique our interest? A distressed animal, a hidden lane, the gathering darkness – the elements are all present for a minor adventure. Besides,” he added, a wry smile touching his lips, “it is always possible that a distressed hound may lead us to a distressed master, and perhaps a case worthy of our attention. Come, let us see what lies down this promisingly gloomy path.” Without waiting for my reply, he stepped into the dark lane, and I, as always, followed close behind him, the mournful baying of the unseen hound drawing us deeper into the heart of the London night."

But then, when I found how I had betrayed myself, I began to think. I had been warned against you months ago. I had been told that, if the King employed an agent, it would certainly be you. And your address had been given me. Yet, with all this, you made me reveal what you wanted to know. Even after I became suspicious, I found it hard to think evil of such a dear, kind old clergyman. But, you know, I have been trained as an actress myself. Male costume is nothing new to me. I often take advantage of the freedom which it gives. I sent John, the coachman, to watch you, ran upstairs, got into my walking clothes, as I call them, and came down just as you departed.\n    “Well, I followed you to your door, and so made sure that I was really an object of interest to the celebrated Mr. Sherlock Holmes. Then I, rather imprudently, wished you good-night, and started for the Temple to see my husband.\n    “We both thought the best resource was flight, when pursued by so formidable an antagonist; so you will find the nest empty when you call to-morrow. As to the photograph, your client may rest in peace. I love and am loved by a better man than he. The King may do what he will without hindrance from one whom he has cruelly wronged. I keep it only to safeguard myself, and to preserve a weapon which will always secure me from any steps which he might take in the future. I leave a photograph which he might care to possess; and I remain, dear Mr. Sherlock Holmes,“Very truly yours,\n“IRENE NORTON, née ADLER.”",

Very much so.”\n“Then I can wait in the next room.”\n“Not at all. This gentleman, Mr. Wilson, has been my partner and helper in many of my most successful cases, and I have no doubt that he will be of the utmost use to me in yours also.”\nThe stout gentleman half rose from his chair and gave a bob of greeting, with a quick little questioning glance from his small fat-encircled eyes.\n“Try the settee,” said Holmes, relapsing into his armchair and putting his fingertips together, as was his custom when in judicial moods. “I know, my dear Watson, that you share my love of all that is bizarre and outside the conventions and humdrum routine of everyday life. You have shown your relish for it by the enthusiasm which has prompted you to chronicle, and, if you will excuse my saying so, somewhat to embellish so many of my own little adventures.”\n“Your cases have indeed been of the greatest interest to me,” I observed.\n“You will remember that I remarked the other day, just before we went into the very simple problem presented by Miss Mary Sutherland, that for strange effects and extraordinary combinations we must go to life itself, which is always far more daring than any effort of the imagination.”\n“A proposition which I took the liberty of doubting.”\n“You did, Doctor, but none the less you must come round to my view, for otherwise I shall keep on piling fact upon fact on you until your reason breaks down under them and acknowledges me to be right. Now, Mr. Jabez Wilson here has been good enough to call upon me this morning, and to begin a narrative which promises to be one of the most singular which I have listened to for some time. You have heard me remark that the strangest and most unique things are very often connected not with the larger but with the smaller crimes, and occasionally, indeed, where there is room for doubt whether any positive crime has been committed. As far as I have heard, it is impossible for me to say whether the present case is an instance of crime or not, but the course of events is certainly among the most singular that I have ever listened to. Perhaps, Mr. Wilson, you would have the great kindness to recommence your narrative. I ask you not merely because my friend Dr. Watson has not heard the opening part but also because the peculiar nature of the story makes me anxious to have every possible detail from your lips. As a rule, when I have heard some slight indication of the course of events, I am able to guide myself by the thousands of other similar cases which occur to my memory. In the present instance I am forced to admit that the facts are, to the best of my belief, unique.”",

As he glanced down the advertisement column, with his head thrust forward and the paper flattened out upon his knee, I took a good look at the man and endeavoured, after the fashion of my companion, to read the indications which might be presented by his dress or appearance.\nI did not gain very much, however, by my inspection. Our visitor bore every mark of being an average commonplace British tradesman, obese, pompous, and slow. He wore rather baggy grey shepherd’s check trousers, a not over-clean black frock-coat, unbuttoned in the front, and a drab waistcoat with a heavy brassy Albert chain, and a square pierced bit of metal dangling down as an ornament. A frayed top-hat and a faded brown overcoat with a wrinkled velvet collar lay upon a chair beside him. Altogether, look as I would, there was nothing remarkable about the man save his blazing red head, and the expression of extreme chagrin and discontent upon his features.\nSherlock Holmes’ quick eye took in my occupation, and he shook his head with a smile as he noticed my questioning glances. “Beyond the obvious facts that he has at some time done manual labour, that he takes snuff, that he is a Freemason, that he has been in China, and that he has done a considerable amount of writing lately, I can deduce nothing else.”\nMr. Jabez Wilson started up in his chair, with his forefinger upon the paper, but his eyes upon my companion.\n“How, in the name of good-fortune, did you know all that, Mr. Holmes?” he asked. “How did you know, for example, that I did manual labour. It’s as true as gospel, for I began as a ship’s carpenter.”\n“Your hands, my dear sir. Your right hand is quite a size larger than your left. You have worked with it, and the muscles are more developed.”\n“Well, the snuff, then, and the Freemasonry?”\n“I won’t insult your intelligence by telling you how I read that, especially as, rather against the strict rules of your order, you use an arc-and-compass breastpin.”\n“Ah, of course, I forgot that. But the writing?”\n“What else can be indicated by that right cuff so very shiny for five inches, and the left one with the smooth patch near the elbow where you rest it upon the desk?”\n“Well, but China?”\n“The fish that you have tattooed immediately above your right wrist could only have been done in China. I have made a small study of tattoo marks and have even contributed to the literature of the subject. That trick of staining the fishes’ scales of a delicate pink is quite peculiar to China. When, in addition, I see a Chinese coin hanging from your watch-chain, the matter becomes even more simple.”\nMr. Jabez Wilson laughed heavily. “Well, I never!” said he.",

His countenance was florid, his hair was of a brilliant, flaming red, and his expression was one of discontent.

As to the snuff, with your snuff-box ever before you, the stains upon your waistcoat, and the powder on your face, I can only say that you have been very careless in your habits.' 'Well, and the China?' 'The fish tattoo upon your wrist, my dear sir. The pink staining of the scales is quite distinctive. When I see a man with a tattoo of a Chinese fish upon his wrist, and when I see a Chinese coin attached to his watch-chain, it is safe to assume that he has been in China.' Mr. Jabez Wilson burst into a hearty fit of laughter. 'Well, sir,' he said, 'I never thought of such things. They are simple enough, to be sure, but I never thought of them. You are right, sir. I have been in China. I was a ship's carpenter there, and I have been writing a good deal lately. And I do take snuff, and I am a Freemason. And I have done manual labour.

INACCURATE ELEMENTS:\n- The completion introduces invented reflections about the client's character, such as suggestions of shrewdness and humor, which are not present in the original.\n- There are inaccuracies in the description of the client's appearance, such as references to his facial hair and repeated emphasis on his red hair and supposed good humor, which do not align with the original portrayal.\n- The passage repeats certain phrases and sentences multiple times, which is not reflective of the original's structure or content.\n- The sequence of events is disrupted by the repetition and by the omission of the deductive exchange, leading to a loss of narrative progression."

He and a girl of fourteen, who does a bit of simple cooking and keeps the place clean—that’s all I have in the house, for I am a widower and never had any family.

It’s not a very large affair, and of late years it has not done more than just give me a living. I used to be able to keep two assistants, but now I only keep one; and I would have a job to pay him but that he is willing to come for half wages so as to learn the business.”\n“What is the name of this obliging youth?” asked Sherlock Holmes.\n“His name is Vincent Spaulding, and he’s not such a youth, either. It’s hard to say his age. I should not wish a smarter assistant, Mr. Holmes; and I know very well that he could better himself and earn twice what I am able to give him. But, after all, if he is satisfied, why should I put ideas in his head?”\n“Why, indeed? You seem most fortunate in having an employé who comes under the full market price. It is not a common experience among employers in this age. I don’t know that your assistant is not as remarkable as your advertisement.”\n“Oh, he has his faults, too,” said Mr. Wilson. “Never was such a fellow for photography. Snapping away with a camera when he ought to be improving his mind, and then diving down into the cellar like a rabbit into its hole to develop his pictures. That is his main fault, but on the whole he’s a good worker. There’s no vice in him.”\n“He is still with you, I presume?”\n“Yes, sir. He and a girl of fourteen, who does a bit of simple cooking and keeps the place clean—that’s all I have in the house, for I am a widower and never had any family.

Spaulding, he came down into the office just this day eight weeks, with this very paper in his hand, and he says:\n“‘I wish to the Lord, Mr. Wilson, that I was a red-headed man.’\n“‘Why that?’ I asks.\n“‘Why,’ says he, ‘here’s another vacancy on the League of the Red-headed Men. It’s worth quite a little fortune to any man who gets it, and I understand that there are more vacancies than there are men, so that the trustees are at their wits’ end what to do with the money. If my hair would only change colour, here’s a nice little crib all ready for me to step into.’\n“‘Why, what is it, then?’ I asked. You see, Mr. Holmes, I am a very stay-at-home man, and as my business came to me instead of my having to go to it, I was often weeks on end without putting my foot over the door-mat. In that way I didn’t know much of what was going on outside, and I was always glad of a bit of news.\n“‘Have you never heard of the League of the Red-headed Men?’ he asked with his eyes open.\n“‘Never.’\n“‘Why, I wonder at that, for you are eligible yourself for one of the vacancies.’\n“‘And what are they worth?’ I asked.\n“‘Oh, merely a couple of hundred a year, but the work is slight, and it need not interfere very much with one’s other occupations.’\n“Well, you can easily think that that made me prick up my ears, for the business has not been over good for some years, and an extra couple of hundred would have been very handy.\n“‘Tell me all about it,’ said I.\n“‘Well,’ said he, showing me the advertisement, ‘you can see for yourself that the League has a vacancy, and there is the address where you should apply for particulars. As far as I can make out, the League was founded by an American millionaire, Ezekiah Hopkins, who was very peculiar in his ways. He was himself red-headed, and he had a great sympathy for all red-headed men; so, when he died, it was found that he had left his enormous fortune in the hands of trustees, with instructions to apply the interest to the providing of easy berths to men whose hair is of that colour. From all I hear it is splendid pay and very little to do.’\n“‘But,’ said I, ‘there would be millions of red-headed men who would apply.’\n“‘Not so many as you might think,’ he answered. ‘You see it is really confined to Londoners, and to grown men. This American had started from London when he was young, and he wanted to do the old town a good turn. Then, again, I have heard it is no use your applying if your hair is light red, or dark red, or anything but real bright, blazing, fiery red. Now, if you cared to apply, Mr. Wilson, you would just walk in; but perhaps it would hardly be worth your while to put yourself out of the way for the sake of a few hundred pounds.’\n“Now, it is a fact, gentlemen, as you may see for yourselves, that my hair is of a very full and rich tint, so that it seemed to me that if there was to be any competition in the matter I stood as good a chance as any man that I had ever met. Vincent Spaulding seemed to know so much about it that I thought he might prove useful, so I just ordered him to put up the shutters for the day and to come right away with me. He was very willing to have a holiday, so we shut the business up and started off for the address that was given us in the advertisement.\n“I never hope to see such a sight as that again, Mr. Holmes. From north, south, east, and west every man who had a shade of red in his hair had tramped into the city to answer the advertisement. Fleet Street was choked with red-headed folk, and Pope’s Court looked like a coster’s orange barrow. I should not have thought there were so many in the whole country as were brought together by that single advertisement. Every shade of colour they were—straw, lemon, orange, brick, Irish-setter, liver, clay; but, as Spaulding said, there were not many who had the real vivid flame-coloured tint. When I saw how many were waiting, I would have given it up in despair; but Spaulding would not hear of it. How he did it I could not imagine, but he pushed and pulled and butted until he got me through the crowd, and right up to the steps which led to the office. There was a double stream upon the stair, some going up in hope, and some coming back dejected; but we wedged in as well as we could and soon found ourselves in the office.”",

Also, as I am sure you will agree, Mr. Holmes, I have not a very striking head of hair. But, bless you, it was a rich auburn then, and I was very proud of it. “Well, sir, this advertisement came to my notice through my assistant, Mr. Vincent Spaulding, and he’s himself just such a smart, keen fellow as you’d wish to meet. I never knew a man work harder, and he’s not to be caught napping, I can assure you. It’s no joke when he’s by, I promise you. “It was on Saturday morning, the 27th of April, that Spaulding came into the office with this paper in his hand and said: “‘I wish to the Lord, Mr. Wilson, that I was a red-headed man.’ “‘Why that?’ I asked. “‘Because there’s been an advertisement here,’ he answered, ‘a vacancy in the League of the Red-headed Men.

He was sure that I should have no difficulty in getting it; but that the main point was to be there early, and not to lose the chance. “So, as you may imagine, Mr. Holmes, I was very glad to hear of anything which might bring in a little extra, for my business is not over good, and his pay comes out of it. I thought that he would just help me in the shop when I was out, but he wouldn’t hear of it. He said that he would rather lose a situation than miss such a chance as that. So he pushed me out of the chair, and he would not let me wash my face, but he insisted that I should go just as I was and apply for the vacancy. “I went with him, and the streets were so full of red-headed people that I never saw anything like it in my life. Fleet Street was choked with them, and we had hard work to make our way through the crowd. At last we got to the corner of Pope’s Court, and there was a stream of red-heads flowing up the alley and another stream of red-heads flowing down, all red-headed men, and all in a great state of excitement. It is a narrow alley, Pope’s Court, but it was crammed from end to end with red-headed folk, and I should not have thought there were so many in all the world. In the middle, with his hair as red as fire, there was a little man bobbing up and down in the crowd, and he was the agent, Mr. Duncan Ross, who was giving directions to the applicants. I never saw such a sight! And the air was thick with the shouts of the people, and the noise of the cabs and the buses, and the general hubbub. “At last, with the help of Spaulding, I got right up to the office door, and there was a board on the wall with ‘The Red-headed League’ in great red letters upon it. I never thought of applying, for I was sure there would be a hundred applicants for every vacancy, but Spaulding would not let me go.

My business is not a very exciting one, and I have never had occasion to leave my house for more than a few hours at a time. But this advertisement, you see, was in the Morning Chronicle of April 27, 1890, and it caught the eye of my assistant, Vincent Spaulding. He’s a sharp fellow, Mr. Holmes, though he only takes half-wages. He’s a great hand at photography, and he’ll dive down into the cellar to develop his pictures at any hour of the day or night. That’s his hobby, you see, and I allow it, for he’s a good worker otherwise, and he’s quick and handy. Well, this advertisement read: ‘To red-headed men. The Red-Headed League is empowered to appoint a few extra members for purely nominal services. Annual salary, £4 a week. Apply in person on Monday, at eleven o’clock, to Duncan Ross, at the offices of the League, 7 Pope’s Court, Fleet Street.’\n\n“Spaulding was tremendously excited about this. He said it was a chance of a lifetime for a red-headed man like me. Now, my hair is, as you can see, a very decided shade of orange-red, and there are not so many men with hair like mine that you would think there would be a league for them. But Spaulding insisted. He said I must apply. I wasn’t keen, mind you, but he wouldn’t let up. He said he’d mind the shop while I went. So, on Monday morning, we set off together, Spaulding and I, to Pope’s Court. I never saw such a sight in my life, Mr. Holmes. The street was packed with red-headed men. Every shade you could imagine – brick-red, straw-red, orange-red, ginger-red, all pushing and shoving to get into the court. It was like a fire in a hayfield! Spaulding, being a little chap, wriggled his way through the crowd, and I followed behind him. He seemed to know just what to do. He got us right up to the office door, which was at the top of a flight of stairs.\n\n“There was a notice on the door saying ‘The Red-Headed League.’ We went in, and there was a small office, and sitting behind a table was a small man with hair even redder than mine. This was Mr. Duncan Ross, I supposed. Spaulding pushed me forward and said, ‘This is your man, Mr. Ross,’ and then he winked at me and slipped away into the crowd outside. Mr. Ross was very pleasant. He said there were a great many applicants, but he thought I might suit. He asked me a few questions about my business and my habits, and then he said that the object of the League was to promote the interests of red-headed men and that the vacancy was for a man who could do some purely nominal work. He said the pay was £4 a week, which, as you know, Mr. Holmes, is very good pay for doing nothing much. He explained that the work was to copy out the Encyclopaedia Britannica. He showed me a large, thick volume, and said I was to copy it all out, letter for letter, in the office provided. The hours were from ten to two, and I was not to leave the office during those hours, not even for a moment. If I left, I would forfeit the position. He said the League was very strict on that point.\n\n“I was a bit taken aback by the strangeness of it all, but £4 a week for four hours’ copying seemed too good to miss. Mr. Ross said I could start at once. He led me into a little room behind the office, which was furnished with a"

He said a few words to each candidate as he came up, and then he always managed to find some fault in them which would disqualify them. Getting a vacancy did not seem to be such a very easy matter, after all. However, when our turn came the little man was much more favourable to me than to any of the others, and he closed the door as we entered, so that he might have a private word with us.\n“‘This is Mr. Jabez Wilson,’ said my assistant, ‘and he is willing to fill a vacancy in the League.’\n“‘And he is admirably suited for it,’ the other answered. ‘He has every requirement. I cannot recall when I have seen anything so fine.’ He took a step backward, cocked his head on one side, and gazed at my hair until I felt quite bashful. Then suddenly he plunged forward, wrung my hand, and congratulated me warmly on my success.\n“‘It would be injustice to hesitate,’ said he. ‘You will, however, I am sure, excuse me for taking an obvious precaution.’ With that he seized my hair in both his hands, and tugged until I yelled with the pain. ‘There is water in your eyes,’ said he as he released me. ‘I perceive that all is as it should be. But we have to be careful, for we have twice been deceived by wigs and once by paint. I could tell you tales of cobbler’s wax which would disgust you with human nature.’ He stepped over to the window and shouted through it at the top of his voice that the vacancy was filled. A groan of disappointment came up from below, and the folk all trooped away in different directions until there was not a red-head to be seen except my own and that of the manager.\n“‘My name,’ said he, ‘is Mr. Duncan Ross, and I am myself one of the pensioners upon the fund left by our noble benefactor. Are you a married man, Mr. Wilson? Have you a family?’\n“I answered that I had not.\n“His face fell immediately.\n“‘Dear me!’ he said gravely, ‘that is very serious indeed! I am sorry to hear you say that. The fund was, of course, for the propagation and spread of the red-heads as well as for their maintenance. It is exceedingly unfortunate that you should be a bachelor.’\n“My face lengthened at this, Mr. Holmes, for I thought that I was not to have the vacancy after all; but after thinking it over for a few minutes he said that it would be all right.\n“‘In the case of another,’ said he, ‘the objection might be fatal, but we must stretch a point in favour of a man with such a head of hair as yours. When shall you be able to enter upon your new duties?’\n“‘Well, it is a little awkward, for I have a business already,’ said I.\n“‘Oh, never mind about that, Mr. Wilson!’ said Vincent Spaulding. ‘I should be able to look after that for you.’\n“‘What would be the hours?’ I asked.\n“‘Ten to two.’\n“Now a pawnbroker’s business is mostly done of an evening, Mr. Holmes, especially Thursday and Friday evening, which is just before pay-day; so it would suit me very well to earn a little in the mornings. Besides, I knew that my assistant was a good man, and that he would see to anything that turned up.\n“‘That would suit me very well,’ said I. ‘And the pay?’\n“‘Is £ 4 a week.’\n“‘And the work?’\n“‘Is purely nominal.’\n“‘What do you call purely nominal?’\n“‘Well, you have to be in the office, or at least in the building, the whole time. If you leave, you forfeit your whole position forever. The will is very clear upon that point. You don’t comply with the conditions if you budge from the office during that time.’\n“‘It’s only four hours a day, and I should not think of leaving,’ said I.\n“‘No excuse will avail,’ said Mr. Duncan Ross; ‘neither sickness nor business nor anything else. There you must stay, or you lose your billet.’\n“‘And the work?’\n“‘Is to copy out the Encyclopædia Britannica. There is the first volume of it in that press. You must find your own ink, pens, and blotting-paper, but we provide this table and chair. Will you be ready to-morrow?’\n“‘Certainly,’ I answered.\n“‘Then, good-bye, Mr. Jabez Wilson, and let me congratulate you once more on the important position which you have been fortunate enough to gain.’ He bowed me out of the room and I went home with my assistant, hardly knowing what to say or do, I was so pleased at my own good fortune.",

It seemed altogether past belief that anyone could make such a will, or that they would pay such a sum for doing anything so simple as copying out the Encyclopædia Britannica. Vincent Spaulding did what he could to cheer me up, but by bedtime I had reasoned myself out of the whole thing. However, in the morning I determined to have a look at it anyhow, so I bought a penny bottle of ink, and with a quill-pen, and seven sheets of foolscap paper, I started off for Pope’s Court.\n“Well, to my surprise and delight, everything was as right as possible. The table was set out ready for me, and Mr. Duncan Ross was there to see that I got fairly to work. He started me off upon the letter A, and then he left me; but he would drop in from time to time to see that all was right with me. At two o’clock he bade me good-day, complimented me upon the amount that I had written, and locked the door of the office after me.\n“This went on day after day, Mr. Holmes, and on Saturday the manager came in and planked down four golden sovereigns for my week’s work. It was the same next week, and the same the week after. Every morning I was there at ten, and every afternoon I left at two. By degrees Mr. Duncan Ross took to coming in only once of a morning, and then, after a time, he did not come in at all. Still, of course, I never dared to leave the room for an instant, for I was not sure when he might come, and the billet was such a good one, and suited me so well, that I would not risk the loss of it.\n“Eight weeks passed away like this, and I had written about Abbots and Archery and Armour and Architecture and Attica, and hoped with diligence that I might get on to the B’s before very long. It cost me something in foolscap, and I had pretty nearly filled a shelf with my writings. And then suddenly the whole business came to an end.”\n“To an end?”\n“Yes, sir. And no later than this morning. I went to my work as usual at ten o’clock, but the door was shut and locked, with a little square of cardboard hammered on to the middle of the panel with a tack.

October 9, 1890.”\nSherlock Holmes and I surveyed this curt announcement and the rueful face behind it, until the comical side of the affair so completely overtopped every other consideration that we both burst out into a roar of laughter.\n“I cannot see that there is anything very funny,” cried our client, flushing up to the roots of his flaming head. “If you can do nothing better than laugh at me, I can go elsewhere.”\n“No, no,” cried Holmes, shoving him back into the chair from which he had half risen. “I really wouldn’t miss your case for the world. It is most refreshingly unusual. But there is, if you will excuse my saying so, something just a little funny about it. Pray what steps did you take when you found the card upon the door?”\n“I was staggered, sir. I did not know what to do. Then I called at the offices round, but none of them seemed to know anything about it. Finally, I went to the landlord, who is an accountant living on the ground floor, and I asked him if he could tell me what had become of the Red-headed League. He said that he had never heard of any such body. Then I asked him who Mr. Duncan Ross was. He answered that the name was new to him.\n“‘Well,’ said I, ‘the gentleman at No. 4.’\n“‘What, the red-headed man?’\n“‘Yes.’\n“‘Oh,’ said he, ‘his name was William Morris. He was a solicitor and was using my room as a temporary convenience until his new premises were ready. He moved out yesterday.’\n“‘Where could I find him?’\n“‘Oh, at his new offices. He did tell me the address. Yes, 17 King Edward Street, near St. Paul’s.’\n“I started off, Mr. Holmes, but when I got to that address it was a manufactory of artificial knee-caps, and no one in it had ever heard of either Mr. William Morris or Mr. Duncan Ross.”\n“And what did you do then?” asked Holmes.\n“I went home to Saxe-Coburg Square, and I took the advice of my assistant. But he could not help me in any way. He could only say that if I waited I should hear by post. But that was not quite good enough, Mr. Holmes. I did not wish to lose such a place without a struggle, so, as I had heard that you were good enough to give advice to poor folk who were in need of it, I came right away to you.”\n“And you did very wisely,” said Holmes. “Your case is an exceedingly remarkable one, and I shall be happy to look into it. From what you have told me I think that it is possible that graver issues hang from it than might at first sight appear.”\n“Grave enough!” said Mr. Jabez Wilson. “Why, I have lost four pound a week.”\n“As far as you are personally concerned,” remarked Holmes, “I do not see that you have any grievance against this extraordinary league. On the contrary, you are, as I understand, richer by some £ 30, to say nothing of the minute knowledge which you have gained on every subject which comes under the letter A. You have lost nothing by them.”\n“No, sir. But I want to find out about them, and who they are, and what their object was in playing this prank—if it was a prank—upon me. It was a pretty expensive joke for them, for it cost them two and thirty pounds.”\n“We shall endeavour to clear up these points for you. And, first, one or two questions, Mr. Wilson. This assistant of yours who first called your attention to the advertisement—how long had he been with you?”\n“About a month then.”\n“How did he come?”\n“In answer to an advertisement.”\n“Was he the only applicant?”\n“No, I had a dozen.”\n“Why did you pick him?”\n“Because he was handy and would come cheap.”\n“At half wages, in fact.”\n“Yes.”\n“What is he like, this Vincent Spaulding?”\n“Small, stout-built, very quick in his ways, no hair on his face, though he’s not short of thirty. Has a white splash of acid upon his forehead.”\nHolmes sat up in his chair in considerable excitement. “I thought as much,” said he. “Have you ever observed that his ears are pierced for earrings?”\n“Yes, sir. He told me that a gipsy had done it for him when he was a lad.”\n“Hum!” said Holmes, sinking back in deep thought. “He is still with you?”\n“Oh, yes, sir; I have only just left him.”\n“And has your business been attended to in your absence?”\n“Nothing to complain of, sir. There’s never very much to do of a morning.”\n“That will do, Mr. Wilson. I shall be happy to give you an opinion upon the subject in the course of a day or two. To-day is Saturday, and I hope that by Monday we may come to a conclusion.”",

I was fairly staggered at this, Mr. Holmes. And when I came back to my office, and found that my assistant, Vincent Spaulding, had quietly gone off to his dinner, and had left the business to look after itself, I thought that I really could stand it no longer. I have ever since been wondering what it means, and what object the rascals could have had in playing this prank upon me. It was the four pounds a week which worried me first, but now I feel that it is just as important to me to know all about the affair as it is to get my money back again, and a great deal more so, since none of it is ever likely to come back.

            "prefix-probing": "He held up a piece of white cardboard about the size of a sheet of note-paper. Upon it was drawn a rough but unmistakable sketch of a human figure, executed in thick, black lines. The figure was peculiar; it was stick-like, almost childish in its simplicity, yet there was something unnervingly specific about it. It stood with arms outstretched, and its head was a simple circle. But the legs! The legs were drawn with a strange, angular kink, as if broken or bent at an impossible angle. Below the figure were five dots, arranged in a pattern that meant nothing to my untrained eye. Three were in a line, and two below them, slightly offset. The whole thing was crude, yet it possessed a certain disturbing power, like a primitive warning or a coded message from a mind operating outside the bounds of conventional thought. \"Well, Watson, what do you make of this?\" Holmes asked, his eyes gleaming with that peculiar light that always signalled the awakening of his formidable intellect. He held the cardboard carefully by the edges, as if it were a fragile relic. I took it from him, turning it over in my hands. The cardboard itself was ordinary enough, perhaps cut from a packing case or a large envelope. There were no watermarks, no distinguishing features on the reverse side. The drawing was clearly done with a thick pencil or charcoal. \"It's... a drawing,\" I stammered, feeling utterly inadequate. \"A very strange one. It looks like a child's drawing, but the legs... they're all wrong. And the dots? I can't make head or tail of it, Holmes.\" Holmes chuckled softly, a sound like dry leaves rustling. \"Precisely, my dear fellow. It is a drawing, and a strange one. But it is not, I fancy, the work of a child. Observe the firmness of the lines, the deliberate nature of the strokes. There is purpose here, Watson, though the hand that guided the pencil may not have been skilled in draughtsmanship. And the legs, as you rightly point out, are the most striking feature. That peculiar angle... it suggests something specific, does it not?\" He took the cardboard back, holding it at arm's length and scrutinizing it intently. \"And the dots,\" he murmured. \"Five dots. A common enough symbol, perhaps, but in conjunction with this figure... it becomes significant. This was slipped under our door, Watson, not ten minutes ago. No sound, no knock, simply this piece of cardboard appearing as if by magic.\" He walked over to the window, peering down into the street. \"Whoever delivered it was swift and silent. They clearly did not wish to be seen.\" I felt a shiver run down my spine. The anonymity of the delivery, combined with the cryptic nature of the message, created an atmosphere of unease. \"Do you think it's a threat, Holmes?\" I asked. \"Or a plea for help?\" \"It could be either, or neither,\" he replied, turning back into the room. \"It is a communication, Watson, and like all communications, it has a sender and a recipient, and a meaning. Our task is to identify the sender and decipher the meaning.\" He placed the cardboard on the table, pulling a magnifying glass from his pocket. He bent over the drawing, his nose almost touching the surface. He examined the texture of the cardboard, the quality of the lines, the faint indentations left by the pencil. \"No fingerprints, naturally,\" he muttered. \"The surface is too rough to hold them clearly, and I daresay our visitor was careful. But look here, Watson, at the very edge of the drawing, just beside the leftmost dot.\" I leaned closer, following his gaze. \"Do you see it? A faint smudge, almost imperceptible. It's graphite, but mixed with something else. Something dark and slightly greasy.\" He touched it lightly with the tip of a probe from his case. \"Coal dust, perhaps? Or soot?\" He straightened up, a thoughtful expression on his face. \"This suggests an origin, Watson. Not from a clean, domestic environment. Perhaps a factory, a railway yard, or some place where coal is handled.\" He then turned his attention back to the drawing itself. \"The figure... the stick man. It's a common enough doodle, but the details are key. The outstretched arms, the simple head, and those impossible legs. What could that angle signify? A broken limb? A specific posture? A code?\" He paced the room, his hands clasped behind his back, his eyes fixed on the ceiling. \"And the five dots. Five of something. Five people? Five days? Five pounds? The possibilities are endless, and without context, the symbol is mute.\" He stopped abruptly, picking up the cardboard again. \"Let us assume, for a moment, that this is a message intended for someone specific. Why deliver it here, to Baker Street? Are we involved, or are we merely a convenient drop-point?\" He looked at me, his eyes sharp and questioning. \"Have you, by any chance, mentioned any recent cases or acquaintances that might involve strange drawings or individuals with peculiar leg injuries, Watson?\" I racked my brain, but nothing came to mind. \"No, Holmes, nothing of the sort. My recent patients have been quite mundane, I assure you.\" \"Hmm,\" he mused. \"Then it is likely that the message is intended for me, or perhaps for us jointly. But why this method? Why not a letter, or a telegram, or a direct visit? The clandestine nature of the delivery suggests fear, or perhaps a"

          "text_segment": "“Well, Watson,” said Holmes when our visitor had left us, “what do you make of it all?”\n“I make nothing of it,” I answered frankly. “It is a most mysterious business.”\n“As a rule,” said Holmes, “the more bizarre a thing is the less mysterious it proves to be. It is your commonplace, featureless crimes which are really puzzling, just as a commonplace face is the most difficult to identify. But I must be prompt over this matter.”\n“What are you going to do, then?” I asked.\n“To smoke,” he answered. “It is quite a three pipe problem, and I beg that you won’t speak to me for fifty minutes.” He curled himself up in his chair, with his thin knees drawn up to his hawk-like nose, and there he sat with his eyes closed and his black clay pipe thrusting out like the bill of some strange bird. I had come to the conclusion that he had dropped asleep, and indeed was nodding myself, when he suddenly sprang out of his chair with the gesture of a man who has made up his mind and put his pipe down upon the mantelpiece.\n“Sarasate plays at the St. James’s Hall this afternoon,” he remarked. “What do you think, Watson? Could your patients spare you for a few hours?”\n“I have nothing to do to-day. My practice is never very absorbing.”\n“Then put on your hat and come. I am going through the City first, and we can have some lunch on the way. I observe that there is a good deal of German music on the programme, which is rather more to my taste than Italian or French. It is introspective, and I want to introspect. Come along!”\nWe travelled by the Underground as far as Aldersgate; and a short walk took us to Saxe-Coburg Square, the scene of the singular story which we had listened to in the morning. It was a poky, little, shabby-genteel place, where four lines of dingy two-storied brick houses looked out into a small railed-in enclosure, where a lawn of weedy grass and a few clumps of faded laurel bushes made a hard fight against a smoke-laden and uncongenial atmosphere. Three gilt balls and a brown board with “JABEZ WILSON” in white letters, upon a corner house, announced the place where our red-headed client carried on his business. Sherlock Holmes stopped in front of it with his head on one side and looked it all over, with his eyes shining brightly between puckered lids. Then he walked slowly up the street, and then down again to the corner, still looking keenly at the houses. Finally he returned to the pawnbroker’s, and, having thumped vigorously upon the pavement with his stick two or three times, he went up to the door and knocked. It was instantly opened by a bright-looking, clean-shaven young fellow, who asked him to step in.\n“Thank you,” said Holmes, “I only wished to ask you how you would go from here to the Strand.”\n“Third right, fourth left,” answered the assistant promptly, closing the door.\n“Smart fellow, that,” observed Holmes as we walked away. “He is, in my judgment, the fourth smartest man in London, and for daring I am not sure that he has not a claim to be third. I have known something of him before.”\n“Evidently,” said I, “Mr. Wilson’s assistant counts for a good deal in this mystery of the Red-headed League. I am sure that you inquired your way merely in order that you might see him.”\n“Not him.”\n“What then?”\n“The knees of his trousers.”\n“And what did you see?”\n“What I expected to see.”\n“Why did you beat the pavement?”\n“My dear doctor, this is a time for observation, not for talk. We are spies in an enemy’s country. We know something of Saxe-Coburg Square. Let us now explore the parts which lie behind it.”\nThe road in which we found ourselves as we turned round the corner from the retired Saxe-Coburg Square presented as great a contrast to it as the front of a picture does to the back. It was one of the main arteries which conveyed the traffic of the City to the north and west. The roadway was blocked with the immense stream of commerce flowing in a double tide inward and outward, while the footpaths were black with the hurrying swarm of pedestrians. It was difficult to realise as we looked at the line of fine shops and stately business premises that they really abutted on the other side upon the faded and stagnant square which we had just quitted.\n“Let me see,” said Holmes, standing at the corner and glancing along the line, “I should like just to remember the order of the houses here. It is a hobby of mine to have an exact knowledge of London. There is Mortimer’s, the tobacconist, the little newspaper shop, the Coburg branch of the City and Suburban Bank, the Vegetarian Restaurant, and McFarlane’s carriage-building depot. That carries us right on to the other block. And now, Doctor, we’ve done our work, so it’s time we had some play. A sandwich and a cup of coffee, and then off to violin-land, where all is sweetness and delicacy and harmony, and there are no red-headed clients to vex us with their conundrums.”",

It is your commonplace, featureless crimes which are really puzzling, just as a commonplace face is the most difficult to identify. But I must be prompt over this matter.”\n\n“What are you going to do, then?” I asked.\n\n“To smoke,” he answered. “It is quite a three pipe problem, and I beg that you won’t speak to me for fifty minutes.”\n\nHe curled himself up in his chair, with his thin knees drawn up to his hawk-like nose, and there he sat with his eyes closed and his black clay pipe thrusting out like the bill of some strange bird. I had come to the conclusion that he had dropped asleep, and indeed was nodding myself, when he suddenly sprang from his chair with the gesture of a man who has made up his mind and put his pipe down upon the mantelpiece.\n\n“Sarasate plays at the St. James’s Hall this afternoon,” he remarked. “What do you think, Watson? Could your patients spare you for a few hours?”\n\n“I have nothing to do to-day. My practice is never very absorbing.”\n\n“Then put on your hat and come with me. I am going to the City first, and shall drop you at the concert hall in time for the commencement. I confess that it is a relief to be able to turn to professional matters for a moment. This sarabande of Sarasate’s is charming. Have you ever heard it?”\n\n“Never.”\n\n“Ah, then you have a treat in store. My German sap has run dry, and I am in need of a little southern stimulant. It is a good thing that the programme is German, is it not? For we are going to a German concert.”\n\n“It is a good thing that the programme is German, is it not? For we are going to a German concert.”\n\n“I see that you are not following me,” said he; “and I don’t think that you are very likely to when you understand what I am about. Come along, doctor, and look at one of the most remarkable adventures that ever befell a man.”\n\nWe went out together, and took the Underground as far as Aldersgate. Close by the station we found Saxe-Coburg Square, the scene of the singular story which we had listened to in the morning.

          "text_segment": "My friend was an enthusiastic musician, being himself not only a very capable performer but a composer of no ordinary merit. All the afternoon he sat in the stalls wrapped in the most perfect happiness, gently waving his long, thin fingers in time to the music, while his gently smiling face and his languid, dreamy eyes were as unlike those of Holmes the sleuth-hound, Holmes the relentless, keen-witted, ready-handed criminal agent, as it was possible to conceive. In his singular character the dual nature alternately asserted itself, and his extreme exactness and astuteness represented, as I have often thought, the reaction against the poetic and contemplative mood which occasionally predominated in him. The swing of his nature took him from extreme languor to devouring energy; and, as I knew well, he was never so truly formidable as when, for days on end, he had been lounging in his armchair amid his improvisations and his black-letter editions. Then it was that the lust of the chase would suddenly come upon him, and that his brilliant reasoning power would rise to the level of intuition, until those who were unacquainted with his methods would look askance at him as on a man whose knowledge was not that of other mortals. When I saw him that afternoon so enwrapped in the music at St. James’s Hall I felt that an evil time might be coming upon those whom he had set himself to hunt down.\n“You want to go home, no doubt, Doctor,” he remarked as we emerged.\n“Yes, it would be as well.”\n“And I have some business to do which will take some hours. This business at Coburg Square is serious.”\n“Why serious?”\n“A considerable crime is in contemplation. I have every reason to believe that we shall be in time to stop it. But to-day being Saturday rather complicates matters. I shall want your help to-night.”\n“At what time?”\n“Ten will be early enough.”\n“I shall be at Baker Street at ten.”\n“Very well. And, I say, Doctor, there may be some little danger, so kindly put your army revolver in your pocket.” He waved his hand, turned on his heel, and disappeared in an instant among the crowd.\nI trust that I am not more dense than my neighbours, but I was always oppressed with a sense of my own stupidity in my dealings with Sherlock Holmes. Here I had heard what he had heard, I had seen what he had seen, and yet from his words it was evident that he saw clearly not only what had happened but what was about to happen, while to me the whole business was still confused and grotesque. As I drove home to my house in Kensington I thought over it all, from the extraordinary story of the red-headed copier of the Encyclopædia down to the visit to Saxe-Coburg Square, and the ominous words with which he had parted from me. What was this nocturnal expedition, and why should I go armed? Where were we going, and what were we to do? I had the hint from Holmes that this smooth-faced pawnbroker’s assistant was a formidable man—a man who might play a deep game. I tried to puzzle it out, but gave it up in despair and set the matter aside until night should bring an explanation.\nIt was a quarter-past nine when I started from home and made my way across the Park, and so through Oxford Street to Baker Street. Two hansoms were standing at the door, and as I entered the passage I heard the sound of voices from above. On entering his room, I found Holmes in animated conversation with two men, one of whom I recognised as Peter Jones, the official police agent, while the other was a long, thin, sad-faced man, with a very shiny hat and oppressively respectable frock-coat.\n“Ha! Our party is complete,” said Holmes, buttoning up his pea-jacket and taking his heavy hunting crop from the rack. “Watson, I think you know Mr. Jones, of Scotland Yard? Let me introduce you to Mr. Merryweather, who is to be our companion in to-night’s adventure.”\n“We’re hunting in couples again, Doctor, you see,” said Jones in his consequential way. “Our friend here is a wonderful man for starting a chase. All he wants is an old dog to help him to do the running down.”\n“I hope a wild goose may not prove to be the end of our chase,” observed Mr. Merryweather gloomily.\n“You may place considerable confidence in Mr. Holmes, sir,” said the police agent loftily. “He has his own little methods, which are, if he won’t mind my saying so, just a little too theoretical and fantastic, but he has the makings of a detective in him. It is not too much to say that once or twice, as in that business of the Sholto murder and the Agra treasure, he has been more nearly correct than the official force.”\n“Oh, if you say so, Mr. Jones, it is all right,” said the stranger with deference. “Still, I confess that I miss my rubber. It is the first Saturday night for seven-and-twenty years that I have not had my rubber.”\n“I think you will find,” said Sherlock Holmes, “that you will play for a higher stake to-night than you have ever done yet, and that the play will be more exciting. For you, Mr. Merryweather, the stake will be some £ 30,000; and for you, Jones, it will be the man upon whom you wish to lay your hands.”\n“John Clay, the murderer, thief, smasher, and forger. He’s a young man, Mr. Merryweather, but he is at the head of his profession, and I would rather have my bracelets on him than on any criminal in London. He’s a remarkable man, is young John Clay. His grandfather was a royal duke, and he himself has been to Eton and Oxford. His brain is as cunning as his fingers, and though we meet signs of him at every turn, we never know where to find the man himself. He’ll crack a crib in Scotland one week, and be raising money to build an orphanage in Cornwall the next. I’ve been on his track for years and have never set eyes on him yet.”\n“I hope that I may have the pleasure of introducing you to-night. I’ve had one or two little turns also with Mr. John Clay, and I agree with you that he is at the head of his profession. It is past ten, however, and quite time that we started. If you two will take the first hansom, Watson and I will follow in the second.”\nSherlock Holmes was not very communicative during the long drive and lay back in the cab humming the tunes which he had heard in the afternoon. We rattled through an endless labyrinth of gas-lit streets until we emerged into Farrington Street.\n“We are close there now,” my friend remarked. “This fellow Merryweather is a bank director, and personally interested in the matter. I thought it as well to have Jones with us also. He is not a bad fellow, though an absolute imbecile in his profession. He has one positive virtue. He is as brave as a bulldog and as tenacious as a lobster if he gets his claws upon anyone. Here we are, and they are waiting for us.”\nWe had reached the same crowded thoroughfare in which we had found ourselves in the morning. Our cabs were dismissed, and, following the guidance of Mr. Merryweather, we passed down a narrow passage and through a side door, which he opened for us. Within there was a small corridor, which ended in a very massive iron gate. This also was opened, and led down a flight of winding stone steps, which terminated at another formidable gate. Mr. Merryweather stopped to light a lantern, and then conducted us down a dark, earth-smelling passage, and so, after opening a third door, into a huge vault or cellar, which was piled all round with crates and massive boxes.\n“You are not very vulnerable from above,” Holmes remarked as he held up the lantern and gazed about him.\n“Nor from below,” said Mr. Merryweather, striking his stick upon the flags which lined the floor. “Why, dear me, it sounds quite hollow!” he remarked, looking up in surprise.\n“I must really ask you to be a little more quiet!” said Holmes severely. “You have already imperilled the whole success of our expedition. Might I beg that you would have the goodness to sit down upon one of those boxes, and not to interfere?”\nThe solemn Mr. Merryweather perched himself upon a crate, with a very injured expression upon his face, while Holmes fell upon his knees upon the floor and, with the lantern and a magnifying lens, began to examine minutely the cracks between the stones. A few seconds sufficed to satisfy him, for he sprang to his feet again and put his glass in his pocket.\n“We have at least an hour before us,” he remarked, “for they can hardly take any steps until the good pawnbroker is safely in bed. Then they will not lose a minute, for the sooner they do their work the longer time they will have for their escape. We are at present, Doctor—as no doubt you have divined—in the cellar of the City branch of one of the principal London banks. Mr. Merryweather is the chairman of directors, and he will explain to you that there are reasons why the more daring criminals of London should take a considerable interest in this cellar at present.”\n“It is our French gold,” whispered the director. “We have had several warnings that an attempt might be made upon it.”\n“Your French gold?”\n“Yes. We had occasion some months ago to strengthen our resources and borrowed for that purpose 30,000 napoleons from the Bank of France. It has become known that we have never had occasion to unpack the money, and that it is still lying in our cellar. The crate upon which I sit contains 2,000 napoleons packed between layers of lead foil. Our reserve of bullion is much larger at present than is usually kept in a single branch office, and the directors have had misgivings upon the subject.”\n“Which were very well justified,” observed Holmes. “And now it is time that we arranged our little plans. I expect that within an hour matters will come to a head. In the meantime Mr. Merryweather, we must put the screen over that dark lantern.”\n“And sit in the dark?”\n“I am afraid so. I had brought a pack of cards in my pocket, and I thought that, as we were a partie carrée, you might have your rubber after all. But I see that the enemy’s preparations have gone so far that we cannot risk the presence of a light. And, first of all, we must choose our positions. These are daring men, and though we shall take them at a disadvantage, they may do us some harm unless we are careful. I shall stand behind this crate, and do you conceal yourselves behind those. Then, when I flash a light upon them, close in swiftly. If they fire, Watson, have no compunction about shooting them down.”\nI placed my revolver, cocked, upon the top of the wooden case behind which I crouched. Holmes shot the slide across the front of his lantern and left us in pitch darkness—such an absolute darkness as I have never before experienced. The smell of hot metal remained to assure us that the light was still there, ready to flash out at a moment’s notice. To me, with my nerves worked up to a pitch of expectancy, there was something depressing and subduing in the sudden gloom, and in the cold dank air of the vault.\n“They have but one retreat,” whispered Holmes. “That is back through the house into Saxe-Coburg Square. I hope that you have done what I asked you, Jones?”\n“I have an inspector and two officers waiting at the front door.”\n“Then we have stopped all the holes. And now we must be silent and wait.”",

              "simple_agent_extraction": "My friend was an enthusiastic musician, being himself not only a very capable performer but a composer of no ordinary merit. All the afternoon he sat in the stalls wrapped in the most perfect happiness, gently swaying his head and beating time with an long, thin forefinger. As a rule, however, his powers of appreciation were so keenly developed that he would seldom talk of music, save when he happened to be in some mood for idleness, when he would drone away by the hour upon his violin, often in the most abominable discords, but occasionally in a way which proved his mastery over the instrument. On this occasion, however, he remained silent all the afternoon, buried in the most profound thought. I knew that a great change had come over him, and that he was bracing himself for his supreme effort, for often I had known that the higher he soared the more deeply he plunged into the depression which succeeded the reaction. On Saturday evening he was at his very best, and at his very worst upon Sunday. So absorbed was he in the music that he entirely forgot the presence of his companion, and I felt myself free to observe with attention his remarkable face. His brow was knitted, his eyes were far away, and his thin lips were compressed, while the nervous, impatient fingers were tapping upon his knees. It was usually at such moments that his iron will was working deadly on the quarry which he hunted, and I knew that before I had heard the last of the concert, and the lights which heralded the close, some deep design had been drawn, and the case was already clear to him. When, as we sat in the cab, I asked him what he thought of the violin playing, he answered that it was very fine, but that his thoughts had been elsewhere. I knew that his mind was working hard, and that he was already on the track of the solution of the mystery which had been propounded to him. 'You are right,' he said, in answer to my remark that he seemed to be in a brown study. 'It is a very deep case, and I shall need your help to-night.' 'At what time?' I asked. 'At ten o'clock. It is a serious business, and may be a dangerous one, but I know that you are a man of nerve.' 'I shall be there,' I answered. 'You must not fail me, for it is possible that a good deal may depend upon our promptness. We have to deal with a very cunning man.' 'Is it the pawnbroker's assistant?' I asked. 'It is, and it is not,' he answered. 'This business of the Red-headed League is a mere blind, a pretext. I am afraid that it is a much deeper matter than that. I have reason to think that we may be in time to stop a very serious crime, and I shall need your help.' 'I shall be there,' I repeated. 'And you will bring your army revolver, and three cartridges,' he said. 'And now, good-bye, my dear fellow, I shall be at Baker Street at ten o'clock.' He sprang out of the cab and was gone in an instant. I was not surprised, for I knew that he had some business which would take him hours to accomplish. I went home, and spent the evening in a state of great excitement. I had no idea what was the matter, but I knew that it was something very serious.

                "text": "My friend was an enthusiastic musician, being himself not only a very capable performer but a composer of no ordinary merit. All the afternoon he sat in the stalls wrapped in the most perfect happiness, gently swaying his head and beating time with an long, thin forefinger. As a rule, however, his powers of appreciation were so keenly developed that he would seldom talk of music, save when he happened to be in some mood for idleness, when he would drone away by the hour upon his violin, often in the most abominable discords, but occasionally in a way which proved his mastery over the instrument. On this occasion, however, he remained silent all the afternoon, buried in the most profound thought. I knew that a great change had come over him, and that he was bracing himself for his supreme effort, for often I had known that the higher he soared the more deeply he plunged into the depression which succeeded the reaction. On Saturday evening he was at his very best, and at his very worst upon Sunday. So absorbed was he in the music that he entirely forgot the presence of his companion, and I felt myself free to observe with attention his remarkable face. His brow was knitted, his eyes were far away, and his thin lips were compressed, while the nervous, impatient fingers were tapping upon his knees. It was usually at such moments that his iron will was working deadly on the quarry which he hunted, and I knew that before I had heard the last of the concert, and the lights which heralded the close, some deep design had been drawn, and the case was already clear to him. When, as we sat in the cab, I asked him what he thought of the violin playing, he answered that it was very fine, but that his thoughts had been elsewhere. I knew that his mind was working hard, and that he was already on the track of the solution of the mystery which had been propounded to him. 'You are right,' he said, in answer to my remark that he seemed to be in a brown study. 'It is a very deep case, and I shall need your help to-night.' 'At what time?' I asked. 'At ten o'clock. It is a serious business, and may be a dangerous one, but I know that you are a man of nerve.' 'I shall be there,' I answered. 'You must not fail me, for it is possible that a good deal may depend upon our promptness. We have to deal with a very cunning man.' 'Is it the pawnbroker's assistant?' I asked. 'It is, and it is not,' he answered. 'This business of the Red-headed League is a mere blind, a pretext. I am afraid that it is a much deeper matter than that. I have reason to think that we may be in time to stop a very serious crime, and I shall need your help.' 'I shall be there,' I repeated. 'And you will bring your army revolver, and three cartridges,' he said. 'And now, good-bye, my dear fellow, I shall be at Baker Street at ten o'clock.' He sprang out of the cab and was gone in an instant. I was not surprised, for I knew that he had some business which would take him hours to accomplish. I went home, and spent the evening in a state of great excitement. I had no idea what was the matter, but I knew that it was something very serious.

He sprang out of the cab and was gone in an instant. I went home, and spent the evening in a state of great excitement. It struck me, as I thought the matter over, that the man was certainly a cool and daring scoundrel to risk all for so little. I could not imagine how it was that he could be so confident of carrying out his design, and I was very curious to know what it was that he was after. I had often seen Holmes in a state of great excitement, but I had never seen him so much moved as he was on this occasion. I had no idea what was the matter, but I knew that it was something very serious. At nine o'clock I was at Baker Street, and found two hansom cabs waiting at the door. Inside, Holmes was talking to a man who sat in an armchair, with his back to me. I saw at a glance that he was a police officer, for I saw the gleam of a uniform under his overcoat. Beside him sat a man who was evidently a respectable citizen, but who had a very sad and lugubrious expression upon his face. 'Good evening, my dear Watson,' said Holmes. 'You see that our party is complete. I have asked Mr. Merryweather to join us.' 'We are going to have a little flutter,' said the police officer, whose name I afterwards learned was Peter Jones, of Scotland Yard. 'We are going to have a little flutter,' said he, 'and I think that we shall have a very good run for our money.' 'You are a man of action, Mr. Jones,' said Holmes. 'You are a man of action, and I am a man of thought. We will see which is the better man.' 'I am sure that you will be the better man, Mr. Holmes,' said the police officer. 'I am sure that you will be the better man, for you have the brains, and I have only the brawn.' 'We will see,' said Holmes. 'We will see. And now, Mr. Merryweather, I think that it is time that we were going.' 'I am ready,' said Mr. Merryweather, with a sigh. 'I am ready, but I confess that I should have been very glad to have been at my club at this moment. It is the night of my rubber, and I am afraid that I shall miss it.' 'You will have a rubber of a very different kind to-night,' said Holmes. 'You will have a rubber of a very different kind, and I think that you will find it a very exciting one. The stakes are high, Mr. Merryweather, and I think that we shall have a very good run for our money.' 'What are the stakes?' I asked. 'Thirty thousand pounds,' said Holmes. 'Thirty thousand pounds, and I think that we shall have a very good run for our money.' 'Thirty thousand pounds!' I cried. 'Thirty thousand pounds! Why, that is a fortune!' 'It is a fortune,' said Holmes. 'It is a fortune, and I think that we shall have a very good run for our money.' 'And who is the criminal?' I asked. 'The best and the worst man in London,' said Holmes. 'The best and the worst man in London, and I think that we shall have a very good run for our money.' 'Who is he?' I asked. 'John Clay,' said Holmes. 'John Clay, the notorious murderer, thief, and forger. He is a man of the highest ability, and I think that we shall have a very good run for our money.' 'John Clay!' cried the police officer. 'John Clay! Why, he is the man that we have been after for years! He is the man that we have been after for years, and I think that we shall have a very good run for our money.' 'He is a young man,' said Holmes, 'but he is a man of the highest ability. He is a man of the highest ability, and I think that we shall have a very good run for our money.' 'He is a man of the highest ability,' said the police officer. 'He is a man of the highest ability, and I think that we shall have a very good run for our money.' 'He is a man of the highest ability,' said Holmes.

            "prefix-probing": "My friend was an enthusiastic musician, being himself not only a very capable performer but a composer of no ordinary merit. It was a facet of his complex and often inscrutable character that I found particularly fascinating, a counterpoint to the cold, logical machine he so often presented to the world. His violin was more than an instrument; it was an extension of himself, a conduit for emotions he rarely expressed in words, a companion in his deepest thoughts and his most profound moments of idleness. I recall countless evenings spent in our Baker Street rooms, the gaslight casting long shadows, while Holmes, sprawled in his armchair or pacing the floor, would suddenly seize his violin and draw from it sounds that ranged from the exquisitely beautiful to the utterly jarring. He played with a passion that belied his usual detachment, his long, thin fingers dancing over the strings with a dexterity that was astonishing. He had a peculiar habit of tucking the instrument under his chin at odd moments, sometimes in the middle of a conversation, sometimes when a case was pressing heavily upon him, and would produce a few tentative notes, as if testing the air or seeking inspiration from the very vibrations. His playing was often improvisational, a stream of consciousness translated into melody and harmony. These improvisations were perhaps the most revealing. When a case was going well, or when he was on the verge of a breakthrough, the music would be lively, sometimes even joyous, filled with intricate runs and soaring arpeggios. But when he was baffled, when the threads of a mystery refused to weave themselves into a coherent pattern, his playing would become discordant, melancholic, even mournful. The notes would drag, the harmonies would clash, and the overall effect could be quite unsettling, a musical representation of his internal struggle. At such times, I would sit quietly, observing him, understanding that this was his way of processing, of allowing his subconscious to work upon the problem while his conscious mind was engaged in this seemingly unrelated activity. It was a form of meditation for him, a way to clear the mental clutter and allow the essential facts to surface. He rarely played conventional pieces with any degree of fidelity. While he possessed a deep knowledge of music, particularly classical composers, his own inclination was towards creation rather than recreation. He would sometimes play fragments of sonatas or concertos, but these would quickly dissolve into his own compositions, variations on a theme that existed only in his mind, or entirely new melodies born of the moment. His compositions, when he chose to write them down, were, as I mentioned, of no ordinary merit. They possessed a certain intellectual rigour, a structural complexity that mirrored his own thought processes. There was often a melancholic strain running through them, a sense of the fleeting nature of beauty or the inherent sadness of existence, which again seemed at odds with his generally pragmatic and unsentimental demeanour. Yet, it was there, woven into the fabric of his music. He rarely spoke about his compositions, treating them with a curious mixture of pride and indifference. He would sometimes leave a newly completed score lying on the table, seemingly for my perusal, but would offer no explanation or commentary unless prompted. When I did comment, he would accept praise or criticism with equal equanimity, his true feelings on the matter remaining, as ever, a mystery. Music also served him as a form of relaxation, though his idea of relaxation was often different from that of other men. After a particularly taxing case, or when he had been immersed in his studies for hours on end, he would turn to his violin not necessarily to improvise or compose, but simply to play. At these times, his playing was less intense, more fluid, a gentle exploration of sound rather than a wrestling with ideas. It was a way for him to unwind, to let the tension drain away, and to prepare himself for the next intellectual challenge. I remember one instance, after the rather grim business of the Red-Headed League had been concluded, he spent the entire evening playing, moving from one piece to another, his face serene, a rare expression of contentment. It was a side of him I cherished, for it showed a glimpse of the man beneath the detective, the artist beneath the logician. He had a particular fondness for the works of the old masters, Bach and Mozart being among his favourites. He would sometimes play their pieces with a surprising tenderness, revealing a depth of feeling that he otherwise kept carefully concealed. Yet, even when playing the works of others, he would often introduce subtle variations, small flourishes or alterations that made the piece uniquely his own. It was as if his creative impulse could not be entirely suppressed, even when interpreting the music of geniuses. His violin was a constant presence in our rooms. It lay on the mantelpiece, or on a chair, or sometimes even on the floor, always within easy reach. It was a silent witness to our conversations, our investigations, and the parade of clients who passed through our door. Its very presence seemed to imbue the rooms with a certain atmosphere, a sense that beneath the surface of our ordinary lives lay a world of complexity and artistry. I often wondered about the origins of his musical talent. Had he studied formally? Had he been encouraged as a child? He rarely spoke of his past, and I never pressed him on the matter. But his skill was such that it suggested years of dedication and practice. It was not the amateurish fumbling of a dilettante, but the assured command of a true musician. He could play pieces of considerable technical difficulty with apparent ease, and his understanding of harmony and counterpoint was profound. It was clear that music was not merely a hobby for him, but a significant part of his intellectual and emotional life. He sometimes used music in a more deliberate way, though not in the manner one might expect. He would occasionally play a particular piece or a series of notes when he was trying to recall a specific detail or stimulate a certain line of thought. It was as if the music acted as a key, unlocking memories or connections that were otherwise inaccessible. He never explained this process to me, but I observed it often enough to understand that it was a conscious technique he employed. There were times, too, when his music seemed to have a direct influence on his mood, and consequently, on his work. A particularly melancholic improvisation might lead him down a path of dark speculation, while a lively, energetic piece could fill him with a restless energy, driving him to action. It was a symbiotic relationship between his inner state and the sounds he produced, each influencing the other. I recall one evening when he had been struggling with a particularly intricate problem. He had been pacing the room for hours, his brow furrowed, his pipe long since gone out. Suddenly, he stopped, picked up his violin, and began to play. The music was wild and chaotic at first, a storm of sound that seemed to reflect his frustration. But gradually, it began to coalesce, to find a structure, a rhythm. As the music became more ordered, I saw a change come over him. His shoulders relaxed, the tension in his face eased, and a look of intense concentration replaced the frustration. He played for perhaps half an hour, and when he finally lowered the instrument, there was a light in his eyes that told me he had found his answer. He turned to me, a rare smile playing on his lips, and said, 'Watson, the solution was in the counterpoint. The interplay of themes, the resolution of dissonance. It was all there, in the music.' It was a profound insight into the way his mind worked, a testament to the interconnectedness of his various faculties. His musical ability was not merely a separate talent, but an integral part of his genius, a different language through which he could explore and understand the world. He rarely played for an audience, save for myself. He seemed to have no desire for public performance or recognition for his musical talents. It was a private passion, shared only with the closest confidant. He would sometimes play when clients were present, but it was usually a brief, almost absent-minded interlude, a few notes struck while he was formulating a question or considering a piece of evidence. It was not a performance, but a manifestation of his restless mind. I remember one client, a rather pompous gentleman, who seemed quite taken aback by the sight of the great detective fiddling away in his armchair. He clearly expected a more conventional figure, perhaps poring over dusty tomes or examining clues under a magnifying glass. The sight of Holmes with his violin seemed to shatter his preconceived notions, and he regarded my friend with a mixture of confusion and suspicion. Holmes, of course, was oblivious to his reaction, lost in his own world of sound. His violin was a source of both pleasure and pain for me. Pleasure, because I genuinely appreciated his skill and the beauty of the music he sometimes produced. Pain, because at other times, the discordant, mournful sounds he drew from the instrument were a clear indication of his distress or frustration, and I would feel a pang of sympathy for the burden he carried. Yet, even in its most unsettling moments, his music was always compelling, always a reflection of the extraordinary man who played it. It was a constant reminder that Sherlock Holmes was not merely a calculating machine, but a being of immense complexity, with depths of feeling and artistry that he rarely allowed the world to see. His music was his sanctuary, his confessional, his laboratory of thought. It was the soundtrack to our lives at Baker Street, a melody that wove itself through the fabric of our shared experiences, a testament to the unique and enduring friendship I shared with the world's only consulting detective. The violin, resting silently in its case or lying casually on a surface, was more than just an object; it was a symbol of the hidden currents that flowed beneath the surface of his formidable intellect, a key to understanding the man behind the legend. It was a privilege to witness this private side of him, to hear the music that flowed from his"

          "text_segment": "What a time it seemed! From comparing notes afterwards it was but an hour and a quarter, yet it appeared to me that the night must have almost gone, and the dawn be breaking above us. My limbs were weary and stiff, for I feared to change my position; yet my nerves were worked up to the highest pitch of tension, and my hearing was so acute that I could not only hear the gentle breathing of my companions, but I could distinguish the deeper, heavier in-breath of the bulky Jones from the thin, sighing note of the bank director. From my position I could look over the case in the direction of the floor. Suddenly my eyes caught the glint of a light.\nAt first it was but a lurid spark upon the stone pavement. Then it lengthened out until it became a yellow line, and then, without any warning or sound, a gash seemed to open and a hand appeared, a white, almost womanly hand, which felt about in the centre of the little area of light. For a minute or more the hand, with its writhing fingers, protruded out of the floor. Then it was withdrawn as suddenly as it appeared, and all was dark again save the single lurid spark which marked a chink between the stones.\nIts disappearance, however, was but momentary. With a rending, tearing sound, one of the broad, white stones turned over upon its side and left a square, gaping hole, through which streamed the light of a lantern. Over the edge there peeped a clean-cut, boyish face, which looked keenly about it, and then, with a hand on either side of the aperture, drew itself shoulder-high and waist-high, until one knee rested upon the edge. In another instant he stood at the side of the hole and was hauling after him a companion, lithe and small like himself, with a pale face and a shock of very red hair.\n“It’s all clear,” he whispered. “Have you the chisel and the bags? Great Scott! Jump, Archie, jump, and I’ll swing for it!”\nSherlock Holmes had sprung out and seized the intruder by the collar. The other dived down the hole, and I heard the sound of rending cloth as Jones clutched at his skirts. The light flashed upon the barrel of a revolver, but Holmes’ hunting crop came down on the man’s wrist, and the pistol clinked upon the stone floor.\n“It’s no use, John Clay,” said Holmes blandly. “You have no chance at all.”\n“So I see,” the other answered with the utmost coolness. “I fancy that my pal is all right, though I see you have got his coat-tails.”\n“There are three men waiting for him at the door,” said Holmes.\n“Oh, indeed! You seem to have done the thing very completely. I must compliment you.”\n“And I you,” Holmes answered. “Your red-headed idea was very new and effective.”\n“You’ll see your pal again presently,” said Jones. “He’s quicker at climbing down holes than I am. Just hold out while I fix the derbies.”\n“I beg that you will not touch me with your filthy hands,” remarked our prisoner as the handcuffs clattered upon his wrists. “You may not be aware that I have royal blood in my veins. Have the goodness, also, when you address me always to say ‘sir’ and ‘please.’”\n“All right,” said Jones with a stare and a snigger. “Well, would you please, sir, march upstairs, where we can get a cab to carry your Highness to the police-station?”\n“That is better,” said John Clay serenely. He made a sweeping bow to the three of us and walked quietly off in the custody of the detective.\n“Really, Mr. Holmes,” said Mr. Merryweather as we followed them from the cellar, “I do not know how the bank can thank you or repay you. There is no doubt that you have detected and defeated in the most complete manner one of the most determined attempts at bank robbery that have ever come within my experience.”\n“I have had one or two little scores of my own to settle with Mr. John Clay,” said Holmes. “I have been at some small expense over this matter, which I shall expect the bank to refund, but beyond that I am amply repaid by having had an experience which is in many ways unique, and by hearing the very remarkable narrative of the Red-headed League.”\n“You see, Watson,” he explained in the early hours of the morning as we sat over a glass of whisky and soda in Baker Street, “it was perfectly obvious from the first that the only possible object of this rather fantastic business of the advertisement of the League, and the copying of the Encyclopædia, must be to get this not over-bright pawnbroker out of the way for a number of hours every day. It was a curious way of managing it, but, really, it would be difficult to suggest a better. The method was no doubt suggested to Clay’s ingenious mind by the colour of his accomplice’s hair. The £ 4 a week was a lure which must draw him, and what was it to them, who were playing for thousands? They put in the advertisement, one rogue has the temporary office, the other rogue incites the man to apply for it, and together they manage to secure his absence every morning in the week. From the time that I heard of the assistant having come for half wages, it was obvious to me that he had some strong motive for securing the situation.”\n“But how could you guess what the motive was?”\n“Had there been women in the house, I should have suspected a mere vulgar intrigue. That, however, was out of the question. The man’s business was a small one, and there was nothing in his house which could account for such elaborate preparations, and such an expenditure as they were at. It must, then, be something out of the house. What could it be? I thought of the assistant’s fondness for photography, and his trick of vanishing into the cellar. The cellar! There was the end of this tangled clue. Then I made inquiries as to this mysterious assistant and found that I had to deal with one of the coolest and most daring criminals in London. He was doing something in the cellar—something which took many hours a day for months on end. What could it be, once more? I could think of nothing save that he was running a tunnel to some other building.\n“So far I had got when we went to visit the scene of action. I surprised you by beating upon the pavement with my stick. I was ascertaining whether the cellar stretched out in front or behind. It was not in front. Then I rang the bell, and, as I hoped, the assistant answered it. We have had some skirmishes, but we had never set eyes upon each other before. I hardly looked at his face. His knees were what I wished to see. You must yourself have remarked how worn, wrinkled, and stained they were. They spoke of those hours of burrowing. The only remaining point was what they were burrowing for. I walked round the corner, saw the City and Suburban Bank abutted on our friend’s premises, and felt that I had solved my problem. When you drove home after the concert I called upon Scotland Yard and upon the chairman of the bank directors, with the result that you have seen.”\n“And how could you tell that they would make their attempt to-night?” I asked.\n“Well, when they closed their League offices that was a sign that they cared no longer about Mr. Jabez Wilson’s presence—in other words, that they had completed their tunnel. But it was essential that they should use it soon, as it might be discovered, or the bullion might be removed. Saturday would suit them better than any other day, as it would give them two days for their escape. For all these reasons I expected them to come to-night.”\n“You reasoned it out beautifully,” I exclaimed in unfeigned admiration. “It is so long a chain, and yet every link rings true.”\n“It saved me from ennui,” he answered, yawning. “Alas! I already feel it closing in upon me. My life is spent in one long effort to escape from the commonplaces of existence. These little problems help me to do so.”\n“And you are a benefactor of the race,” said I.\nHe shrugged his shoulders. “Well, perhaps, after all, it is of some little use,” he remarked. “‘L’homme c’est rien—l’œuvre c’est tout,’ as Gustave Flaubert wrote to George Sand.”",

From four o'clock until close upon six we sat in the dark, without speaking a word, Sherlock Holmes, and I, and Mr. Merryweather, the banker, motionless in our chairs. I could not see the faces of my companions, but from their long, deep breathing I knew that they were resting quietly. A faint glimmer of light filtered down from the street into the vault, which enabled us to see the great square block of stone with the ring in the side of it which was the only entrance to the cellar. Twenty times I fumbled for my revolver and my flashlight, and twenty times I pressed them back into my pocket. I felt that my nerves were as tense as stretched wire, and that any moment the least sound would be enough to snap them. The banker sat as still as a statue, but every now and then a low gurgle of irrepressible laughter came from Sherlock Holmes. Exactly at six o'clock we heard a slight scraping sound from the stone above us. This sound was instantly followed by the faintest possible glimmer of light which shone from the cracks all round the stone. Instantly the scraping ceased, and the light became brighter. For a minute or more nothing happened, then the light flickered and was obscured. A moment later the great stone began to slowly rise, and in the aperture appeared the face of a man, with a light held in front of it. The mask was off the face now. The man was not Mr. Merryweather's assistant, nor was he the pawnbroker's assistant. He was a young man, not more than thirty, small, clean-shaven, and trimly dressed. He held a dark lantern in his hand, and he peered about him as he emerged from the hole. \"All right, Archie,\" he whispered. \"Now for the tools. Get them down.\" Archie was a smaller man, with a shock of very red hair. He scrambled out after his companion, and the two of them stood in the hole, the one helping the other up. \"It's all clear,\" whispered the first. \"Have you the tools?\" \"They are here,\" replied the second. \"We have only to break through this outer wall, and then we are into the bank.\" \"It's a ten-inch wall, and a good job, too,\" muttered the first. \"We shall be through it in no time.\" \"Hold on!\" cried Holmes. \"I have you!\" He sprang out and seized the first man by the collar. The other dived down the hole, and I heard the sound of his feet as he scrambled down the passage. Jones threw himself forward and grabbed at the red-headed man's coat-tails, but they tore away from his grasp, and he was gone. \"You won't get away, Clay,\" shouted Holmes. \"I have you fast.\" \"I don't think so,\" said the man, and he drew a revolver from his pocket. But Holmes struck his wrist with his crop, and the pistol clinked upon the stone floor. \"It's no use, John Clay,\" said Holmes. \"You are trapped.\" \"I see that I am,\" said the man, with a wry smile. \"I suppose there is no use my resisting.\" \"None at all.\" \"And my pal, Archie?\" \"He has got away.\" \"Ah, the lucky dog! I owe him a good turn for this.\" \"You may thank your stars that you are not in for a longer term than you are likely to get,\" said Holmes. \"By the way, I don't think you will find it easy to get out of this hole. There are three men waiting for you at the door.\" \"Oh, indeed!\" said the man. \"You are very thorough, Mr. Holmes. I must say that I have never been caught in such a fashion before.\" \"I don't think you have ever been in such a hole before,\" said Holmes. \"You have certainly been in some tight places, but this is the tightest.\" \"I must admit that it is,\" said the man. \"I have been outwitted. And by a red-headed league, too! It's a capital idea.\" \"It was a capital idea,\" said Holmes. \"But it was a dangerous one.\" \"I know that,\" said the man. \"But I am a dangerous man myself.\" \"That is true,\" said Holmes. \"But you are not so dangerous as you think you are.\" \"Perhaps not,\" said the man. \"But I have had a good run for my money.\" \"You have indeed,\" said Holmes. \"And now, Mr. Clay, I think we will hand you over to the police.\" \"I suppose so,\" said the man. \"But I must say that I have enjoyed the game.\" \"So have I,\" said Holmes. \"And now, Mr. Jones, I think you had better take charge of your prisoner.\" \"All right, Mr. Holmes,\" said Jones. \"Come along, my fine fellow. You have had your run.\" \"Don't you touch me with your filthy hands,\" cried the prisoner. \"I am a gentleman.\" \"Oh, indeed!\" said Jones. \"Well, I am a police officer, and that is good enough for me.\" \"I am a gentleman,\" repeated the prisoner. \"I am of royal blood. I am a descendant of the Dukes of Ormonde.\" \"Oh, indeed!\" said Jones. \"Well, I am a descendant of the Dukes of Scotland, and that is good enough for me.\" He took the prisoner by the arm and led him away. \"Well, Mr. Holmes,\" said Mr. Merryweather, \"I don't know how to thank you. You have saved the bank from a very serious loss.\" \"That is all right, Mr. Merryweather,\" said Holmes. \"I am glad to have been of service.\" \"But how did you know?\" asked the banker. \"How did you know that they were going to break in tonight?\" \"I didn't know,\" said Holmes. \"I only suspected. But I was pretty sure.\" \"And how did you suspect?\" \"Well, it was a long story,\" said Holmes. \"But I will tell you all about it when we get back to Baker Street.\" We went back to Baker Street, and Holmes told me all about it. \"Well, Watson,\" said he, \"you see that it was a very simple matter after all.\" \"I don't see that it was simple at all,\" said I. \"I think it was very complicated.\" \"Not at all,\" said he. \"The main thing was to find out what the Red-Headed League was for. It was clearly to get this man Wilson out of his shop for some hours every day. The method was a very elaborate one, but it was effective. The salary was bait. The object was to get him out of the way so that they could work in his cellar. The fact that the assistant was willing to work for half wages showed that he had some strong motive for being there. I ruled out intrigue, for there were no women in the case. I ruled out robbery, for the shop was a small one, and there was nothing in it to steal. So the motive must be outside the house. What was the assistant doing in the cellar? He was a photographer, and he was developing plates. That was the clue. I made inquiries, and I found that the assistant was a well-known criminal, John Clay, who had been concerned in several robberies. I also found that he was a very clever man, and that he was a master of disguise. The fact that he was working in the cellar for some hours every day, and that he was a criminal, suggested that he was tunneling. Where was he tunneling to? I went to the square, and I found that the cellar did not extend forward. I also found that the bank was next door. So he was tunneling from the cellar into the bank. I then went to the bank, and I found that the vault was next to the cellar. So he was tunneling from the cellar into the vault. I then went back to the square, and I saw the assistant. I recognized him as John Clay. I also noticed that his trousers were worn at the knees. That showed that he had been digging. I then went to Scotland Yard, and I told them what I had found. I also went to the bank, and I told them what I had found. I told them that the Red-Headed League was a blind, and that the real object was to rob the bank.

I ruled out intrigue, for there were no women in the case. I ruled out robbery, for the shop was a small one, and there was nothing in it to steal. So the motive must be outside the house. What was the assistant doing in the cellar? He was a photographer, and he was developing plates. That was the clue. I made inquiries, and I found that the assistant was a well-known criminal, John Clay, who had been concerned in several robberies. I also found that he was a very clever man, and that he was a master of disguise. The fact that he was working in the cellar for some hours every day, and that he was a criminal, suggested that he was tunneling. Where was he tunneling to? I went to the square, and I found that the cellar did not extend forward. I also found that the bank was next door. So he was tunneling from the cellar into the bank. I then went to the bank, and I found that the vault was next to the cellar. So he was tunneling from the cellar into the vault. I then went back to the square, and I saw the assistant. I recognized him as John Clay. I also noticed that his trousers were worn at the knees. That showed that he had been digging. I then went to Scotland Yard, and I told them what I had found. I also went to the bank, and I told them what I had found. I told them that the Red-Headed League was a blind, and that the real object was to rob the bank. I told them that the tunnel was finished, and that the robbery would take place that night. I told them that they must be ready. They were",

We would not dare to conceive the things which are really mere commonplaces of existence. If we could fly out of that window hand in hand, hover over this great city, gently remove the roofs, and peep in at the queer things which are going on, the strange coincidences, the plannings, the cross-purposes, the wonderful chains of events, working through generations, and leading to the most outré results, it would make all fiction with its conventionalities and foreseen conclusions most stale and unprofitable.”\n“And yet I am not convinced of it,” I answered. “The cases which come to light in the papers are, as a rule, bald enough, and vulgar enough. We have in our police reports realism pushed to its extreme limits, and yet the result is, it must be confessed, neither fascinating nor artistic.”\n“A certain selection and discretion must be used in producing a realistic effect,” remarked Holmes. “This is wanting in the police report, where more stress is laid, perhaps, upon the platitudes of the magistrate than upon the details, which to an observer contain the vital essence of the whole matter. Depend upon it, there is nothing so unnatural as the commonplace.”\nI smiled and shook my head. “I can quite understand your thinking so,” I said. “Of course, in your position of unofficial adviser and helper to everybody who is absolutely puzzled, throughout three continents, you are brought in contact with all that is strange and bizarre. But here”—I picked up the morning paper from the ground—“let us put it to a practical test. Here is the first heading upon which I come. ‘A husband’s cruelty to his wife.’ There is half a column of print, but I know without reading it that it is all perfectly familiar to me. There is, of course, the other woman, the drink, the push, the blow, the bruise, the sympathetic sister or landlady. The crudest of writers could invent nothing more crude.”\n“Indeed, your example is an unfortunate one for your argument,” said Holmes, taking the paper and glancing his eye down it. “This is the Dundas separation case, and, as it happens, I was engaged in clearing up some small points in connection with it. The husband was a teetotaler, there was no other woman, and the conduct complained of was that he had drifted into the habit of winding up every meal by taking out his false teeth and hurling them at his wife, which, you will allow, is not an action likely to occur to the imagination of the average story-teller. Take a pinch of snuff, Doctor, and acknowledge that I have scored over you in your example.”",

The stories which come at us out of a hundred windows at once would make all fiction with its conventionalities and foreseen conclusions most stale and unprofitable.”\n\n“And yet I am not of your opinion,” I answered. “The papers which give us a fresh sensation every morning are full of commonplace occurrences and vulgar trivialities. There is always the marriage or the death of some person of importance, which is the same for the whole five millions. There is the daily record of crimes and accidents, which never vary save in their details. There are sensational advertisements and tedious politics. As a rule the unvarnished facts are bald, and more often than not they lack that touch of drama which is the soul of the artist.”\n\n“I fear that you burke the question at the outset by supposing that sensationalism is a measure of truth,” said Holmes. “You will not see it, Watson. How often have I said to you that when you have eliminated the impossible, whatever remains, however improbable, must be the truth? We know, for example, that the musket which fired the fatal shot was not discharged within a thousand yards of the victim. We know, also, that the man was not stabbed. The cause of death was a blow from a blunt instrument. Therefore, we may take it as certain that the blow was delivered from a considerable distance by an apparatus which could be swung round by mechanical power. Does this sound commonplace to you?”\n\n“I confess that I am unable to follow you, Holmes.”\n\n“Perhaps you do not find the commonplace sufficiently difficult to explain,” said he. “You will only believe in some sensational agency. The things which are seen are for ever more important than the things which are unseen, however important the latter may be.”\n\n“I should be glad to discuss the matter in some detail,” said I. “Everyday life is a stimulating thing to me. When I hear you talk of it I feel as if I were back in the midst of it.”\n\n“It is of course a matter of taste,” said Holmes, shrugging his shoulders. “L'homme c'est rien—le travail c'est tout, as Gustave Flaubert wrote to George Sand.”\n\n“A propos of everyday life, here is a little drama which can be arranged in a very few words,” said I, picking up a newspaper from the table. “Remarkable Occurrence in the Antelope Tavern, Leadenhall Street. ‘An elderly man giving the name of James Windibank was arrested last night on charges of assault and battery upon his stepdaughter, Miss Mary Sutherland, whom he had confined to her room for several days. There are no particulars as yet.’ That is commonplace enough, in all conscience.”\n\n“The commonplace is always the most unnatural,” murmured Holmes, with a dreamy smile. “When a doctor does go wrong he is the first of criminals. He has nerve and he has knowledge. Palmer and Pritchard were among the heads of their profession. This man Windibank appears to be a most respectable citizen, and here he is, abusing his own daughter.”\n\n“He is not her father. He is her stepfather.”\n\n“Ah, that makes a difference. It is a case of identity, I perceive. Let us see. James Windibank. He is a man of about fifty, I should judge—tall, spare, and with a high forehead; a man of considerable energy and decision. He has a wife and one daughter, Mary, by a former marriage. He is a man of considerable wealth, and he lives in a large house in the country. He is a man of good character, and he is much respected in the neighbourhood. He is a man of strong will, and he is accustomed to have his own way. He is a man of violent temper, and he is easily provoked. He is a man of great cunning, and he is not to be trifled with. He is a man of considerable physical strength, and he is a good boxer.

Looking over his shoulder, I saw that on the pavement opposite there stood a large woman with a heavy fur boa round her neck, and a large curling red feather in a broad-brimmed hat which was tilted in a coquettish Duchess of Devonshire fashion over her ear. From under this great panoply she peeped up in a nervous, hesitating fashion at our windows, while her body oscillated backward and forward, and her fingers fidgeted with her glove buttons. Suddenly, with a plunge, as of the swimmer who leaves the bank, she hurried across the road, and we heard the sharp clang of the bell.\n“I have seen those symptoms before,” said Holmes, throwing his cigarette into the fire. “Oscillation upon the pavement always means an affaire de cœur. She would like advice, but is not sure that the matter is not too delicate for communication. And yet even here we may discriminate. When a woman has been seriously wronged by a man she no longer oscillates, and the usual symptom is a broken bell wire. Here we may take it that there is a love matter, but that the maiden is not so much angry as perplexed, or grieved. But here she comes in person to resolve our doubts.”\nAs he spoke there was a tap at the door, and the boy in buttons entered to announce Miss Mary Sutherland, while the lady herself loomed behind his small black figure like a full-sailed merchant-man behind a tiny pilot boat. Sherlock Holmes welcomed her with the easy courtesy for which he was remarkable, and, having closed the door and bowed her into an armchair, he looked her over in the minute and yet abstracted fashion which was peculiar to him.\n“Do you not find,” he said, “that with your short sight it is a little trying to do so much typewriting?”",

Looking over his shoulder, I saw that a woman stood on the kerb, in a black dress, with a feather boa round her neck, and a crumpled bonnet upon her head. She was an elderly woman, short, stout, and all puffing and blowing with the exertion of getting there. As I looked at her, and at the little black knot of people upon the pavement, I could read nothing remarkable in this woman save an excitable manner and a set purpose upon her face. \"Do you observe anything remarkable about that woman, Watson?\" inquired Holmes. \"She appears to be agitated,\" I remarked. \"Exactly. But what does she agitate about?\" \"I am not psychic.\" \"Ah, my dear Watson, do not humble yourself. You are not psychic, but at least you are a conductor of knowledge. Some people without possessing genius have a remarkable power of stimulating it in others. I confess, my dear fellow, that I am very much your debtor. It is a mistake to confound strangeness with mystery. The most commonplace crime is often the most mysterious because it is the one to which it is most difficult to find any clue, save the old elementary ones of motive and opportunity. You remember the advice which I gave you when you first came to me--to shun the sensational and cultivate the commonplace. That was the lesson which I rather gathered from my own experience. \"But this woman?\" \"She is a very commonplace and even vulgar woman, but I should not be very much surprised if she proved to be the opening of a very singular case. Did you observe her, Watson, and note her manner? She is evidently irresolute, oscillating between fear and hope, and yet she is determined to consult me.\" \"How can you read all this in her short visit?\" \"The mere fact that she has been here twice, and is now so agitated, is proof of it. But, in addition to this, you can see the slight tremor of her lip, the twitching of her fingers, and the glance which she throws from time to time at our windows. Ah! she has started now!\" As he spoke she came hurrying across the street, and as she passed the circle of yellow light thrown from our lamp just struck upon her face. I could see that it was flushed and agitated. She was, as I had divined, a commonplace woman, but her large face, seamed and lined with trouble, had a character of its own. She was not young, nor was she old, and her dress was of that peculiar kind which suggests a well-filled purse but a limited taste. \"Observe her, Watson. You see the slight hesitation, the timid glance, and then the sudden rush. She is a woman who is not accustomed to doing business for herself, and she is not quite sure that she is doing right now. But she has made up her mind, and she means to see it through.\" As he spoke, the bell rang out with a sharp, metallic clang. \"That is she, Watson,\" said Holmes. \"I have no doubt that she is a client of some importance. Never in my experience have I known a woman to ring the bell with such decision, and yet with such evident hesitation. If she had been a young woman, I should have said that she was a bride, and that she had come to consult me about her trousseau. But she is not young, and she is not a bride. She is a woman who has been deeply wronged, and she has come to me for advice.\" \"But you said just now that she was a commonplace woman.\" \"So she is, my dear Watson, so she is. But the most commonplace woman can be deeply wronged. That is the lesson which I have learned from my experience. The deeper the wrong, the more commonplace the woman. It is the shallow natures that are capable of the greatest crimes.\" \"But you said that she was not a young woman.\" \"So I did, my dear Watson, so I did. But she is not an old woman either. She is a woman of middle age, and she has been deeply wronged. That is the lesson which I have learned from my experience. The deeper the wrong, the more commonplace the woman. It is the shallow natures that are capable of the greatest crimes.\" \"But you said that she was not a bride.\" \"So I did, my dear Watson, so I did. But she is not a widow either. She is a woman who has been deeply wronged, and she has come to me for advice. That is the lesson which I have learned from my experience. The deeper the wrong, the more commonplace the woman.

                "text": "He had risen from his chair and was standing between the parted blinds gazing down into the dull neutral-tinted London street. Looking over his shoulder, I saw that a woman stood on the kerb, in a black dress, with a feather boa round her neck, and a crumpled bonnet upon her head. She was an elderly woman, short, stout, and all puffing and blowing with the exertion of getting there. As I looked at her, and at the little black knot of people upon the pavement, I could read nothing remarkable in this woman save an excitable manner and a set purpose upon her face. \"Do you observe anything remarkable about that woman, Watson?\" inquired Holmes. \"She appears to be agitated,\" I remarked. \"Exactly. But what does she agitate about?\" \"I am not psychic.\" \"Ah, my dear Watson, do not humble yourself. You are not psychic, but at least you are a conductor of knowledge. Some people without possessing genius have a remarkable power of stimulating it in others. I confess, my dear fellow, that I am very much your debtor. It is a mistake to confound strangeness with mystery. The most commonplace crime is often the most mysterious because it is the one to which it is most difficult to find any clue, save the old elementary ones of motive and opportunity. You remember the advice which I gave you when you first came to me--to shun the sensational and cultivate the commonplace. That was the lesson which I rather gathered from my own experience. \"But this woman?\" \"She is a very commonplace and even vulgar woman, but I should not be very much surprised if she proved to be the opening of a very singular case. Did you observe her, Watson, and note her manner? She is evidently irresolute, oscillating between fear and hope, and yet she is determined to consult me.\" \"How can you read all this in her short visit?\" \"The mere fact that she has been here twice, and is now so agitated, is proof of it. But, in addition to this, you can see the slight tremor of her lip, the twitching of her fingers, and the glance which she throws from time to time at our windows. Ah! she has started now!\" As he spoke she came hurrying across the street, and as she passed the circle of yellow light thrown from our lamp just struck upon her face. I could see that it was flushed and agitated. She was, as I had divined, a commonplace woman, but her large face, seamed and lined with trouble, had a character of its own. She was not young, nor was she old, and her dress was of that peculiar kind which suggests a well-filled purse but a limited taste. \"Observe her, Watson. You see the slight hesitation, the timid glance, and then the sudden rush. She is a woman who is not accustomed to doing business for herself, and she is not quite sure that she is doing right now. But she has made up her mind, and she means to see it through.\" As he spoke, the bell rang out with a sharp, metallic clang. \"That is she, Watson,\" said Holmes. \"I have no doubt that she is a client of some importance. Never in my experience have I known a woman to ring the bell with such decision, and yet with such evident hesitation. If she had been a young woman, I should have said that she was a bride, and that she had come to consult me about her trousseau. But she is not young, and she is not a bride. She is a woman who has been deeply wronged, and she has come to me for advice.\" \"But you said just now that she was a commonplace woman.\" \"So she is, my dear Watson, so she is. But the most commonplace woman can be deeply wronged. That is the lesson which I have learned from my experience. The deeper the wrong, the more commonplace the woman. It is the shallow natures that are capable of the greatest crimes.\" \"But you said that she was not a young woman.\" \"So I did, my dear Watson, so I did. But she is not an old woman either. She is a woman of middle age, and she has been deeply wronged. That is the lesson which I have learned from my experience. The deeper the wrong, the more commonplace the woman. It is the shallow natures that are capable of the greatest crimes.\" \"But you said that she was not a bride.\" \"So I did, my dear Watson, so I did. But she is not a widow either.

His tall, gaunt figure was silhouetted against the grey light filtering through the perpetual haze that hung over the city. His hands were clasped behind his back, a characteristic posture when his mind was deeply engaged. The hawk-like profile, with its keen, restless eyes, was turned towards the window, but I knew from the singular intentness of his gaze that he saw far more than the passing cabs and the hurrying figures of pedestrians. His thoughts were evidently miles away, perhaps sifting through the tangled threads of some recent mystery, or perhaps merely contemplating the vast, unexplored ocean of human villainy that lay beneath the surface of this respectable metropolis. There was a stillness about him, a profound concentration that warned me against interruption. The air in the room seemed to vibrate with the intensity of his unspoken cerebration. For a long ten minutes, he remained thus, a statue of thought, oblivious to my presence or the mundane sounds of the street below. Then, with a sudden, sharp movement, he turned from the window, his eyes alight with a peculiar mixture of weariness and intellectual triumph. He ran a hand through his dark, unruly hair and sighed, a sound that seemed to release the tension that had held him captive. 'It is a capital mistake, my dear Watson,' he said, his voice low and reflective, 'to theorize before one has data. Insensibly one begins to twist facts to suit theories, instead of theories to suit facts. I have been guilty of it myself, even in this quiet contemplation of the pavement.' He walked slowly back towards his chair, his long strides covering the length of the room in a few steps, the brief interlude of stillness broken, and the restless energy that was his hallmark once more apparent."

Perhaps I have trained myself to see what others overlook. If not, why should you come to consult me?”\n“I came to you, sir, because I heard of you from Mrs. Etherege, whose husband you found so easy when the police and everyone had given him up for dead. Oh, Mr. Holmes, I wish you would do as much for me. I’m not rich, but still I have a hundred a year in my own right, besides the little that I make by the machine, and I would give it all to know what has become of Mr. Hosmer Angel.”\n“Why did you come away to consult me in such a hurry?” asked Sherlock Holmes, with his finger-tips together and his eyes to the ceiling.\nAgain a startled look came over the somewhat vacuous face of Miss Mary Sutherland. “Yes, I did bang out of the house,” she said, “for it made me angry to see the easy way in which Mr. Windibank—that is, my father—took it all. He would not go to the police, and he would not go to you, and so at last, as he would do nothing and kept on saying that there was no harm done, it made me mad, and I just on with my things and came right away to you.”\n“Your father,” said Holmes, “your stepfather, surely, since the name is different.”\n“Yes, my stepfather.

I wasn’t best pleased, Mr. Holmes, when she married again so soon after father’s death, and a man who was nearly fifteen years younger than herself. Father was a plumber in the Tottenham Court Road, and he left a tidy business behind him, which mother carried on with Mr. Hardy, the foreman; but when Mr. Windibank came he made her sell the business, for he was very superior, being a traveller in wines. They got £ 4700 for the goodwill and interest, which wasn’t near as much as father could have got if he had been alive.”\nI had expected to see Sherlock Holmes impatient under this rambling and inconsequential narrative, but, on the contrary, he had listened with the greatest concentration of attention.\n“Your own little income,” he asked, “does it come out of the business?”\n“Oh, no, sir. It is quite separate and was left me by my uncle Ned in Auckland. It is in New Zealand stock, paying 4½ per cent. Two thousand five hundred pounds was the amount, but I can only touch the interest.”\n“You interest me extremely,” said Holmes. “And since you draw so large a sum as a hundred a year, with what you earn into the bargain, you no doubt travel a little and indulge yourself in every way. I believe that a single lady can get on very nicely upon an income of about £ 60.”\n“I could do with much less than that, Mr. Holmes, but you understand that as long as I live at home I don’t wish to be a burden to them, and so they have the use of the money just while I am staying with them. Of course, that is only just for the time. Mr. Windibank draws my interest every quarter and pays it over to mother, and I find that I can do pretty well with what I earn at typewriting. It brings me twopence a sheet, and I can often do from fifteen to twenty sheets in a day.”\n“You have made your position very clear to me,” said Holmes. “This is my friend, Dr. Watson, before whom you can speak as freely as before myself.

He is six years younger than mother, and a fearfully hard man, very silent, and never smiling. I give you my word, he never smiled once all the time that I lived at home. It is only four months since he married mother.”“Did you not live at home, then?”“No, since father died I have been living with an aunt at Penge. Only moved back again a few weeks ago.”“You say that Mr. Windibank is a wine merchant. I presume that you mean that he buys and sells wine.”“No, Mr. Holmes; he is an agent. He travels for a firm, but he does not buy wines.”“How old is he, this Mr. Windibank?”“He was forty-two in January last.”“And your mother?”“She is forty-five, and father would have been sixty-one had he lived. I am twenty-three myself.”“That makes it clear. And your father, did he die a natural death?”“He was a plumber, Mr. Holmes, and he fell through the roof in a new house which he was building, and broke his neck.”“A sad business. Did he leave much property?”“He saved a little, Mr. Holmes, and he had a building business. He left more than a thousand pounds in the bank, and the business was worth as much again. He insured his life for a thousand, so that we were very well left.”“Did you inherit anything?”“I inherit two hundred and fifty pounds, with the interest at four and a half per cent. It is in New Zealand stock, and the interest is paid every quarter.”“Who administers it?”“The money is in the hands of the trustees, and I can only draw the interest.”“And how much is the interest?”“One hundred pounds a year. It is paid quarterly, and I find it quite enough to live upon.”“Surely you do not live upon a hundred pounds a year?”“No, I have my own earnings as well. I am a typewritist.”“And you earn how much?”“I can earn fifteen shillings a week when I am hard at it. I get two pence a sheet, and I can often do fifteen or twenty sheets in a day.”“You have done very well, Miss Sutherland, upon my word. You have been able to keep yourself comfortably upon your earnings and your interest. You must be a very independent young lady.”“I assure you, Mr. Holmes, that I am very independent. I have my own rooms, and I do not live with mother and Mr. Windibank. I much prefer to be on my own.”“And your mother and Mr. Windibank, do they live comfortably?”“Oh, yes, they have a very good income. Mr. Windibank has his salary, and mother has her own money as well. They are very well off.”“And you say that you are independent. That is very good. Now, tell me, Miss Sutherland, about this young man, Mr. Hosmer Angel, and about the events which led up to your coming to consult me.”“Certainly, Mr. Holmes. It is a very strange story, and I hardly know where to begin.”“Begin at the beginning,” said Holmes, with a smile. “I have already heard a good deal, but I should like to hear it all from your own lips.”“Very well, then. As I have said, I lived with my aunt at Penge after father died. Mother married again, and I did not like Mr. Windibank, so I stayed on with my aunt. But then my aunt married, and I had to come back home. That was about a month ago.”“And since then you have been living with your mother and Mr. Windibank?”“Yes, Mr. Holmes. And it was just after I came back that I met Mr. Hosmer Angel.”“And where did you meet him?”“At the Gasfitters’ Ball. It was a ball given by the Gasfitters’ Union, and Mr. Windibank is a member. He took mother and me to the ball.”“And you met Mr. Hosmer Angel there?”“Yes, Mr. Holmes. He was a very quiet, retiring man, but very nice. He was a gasfitter himself, and he worked for the same firm as Mr. Windibank.”“Indeed. And you fell in love with him?”“Yes, Mr. Holmes. I fell in love with him at once.”“And he with you?”“Yes, Mr. Holmes. He told me that he had never seen anyone like me before.”“And what happened then?”“We met several times after that.

          "text_segment": "A flush stole over Miss Sutherland’s face, and she picked nervously at the fringe of her jacket. “I met him first at the gasfitters’ ball,” she said. “They used to send father tickets when he was alive, and then afterwards they remembered us, and sent them to mother. Mr. Windibank did not wish us to go. He never did wish us to go anywhere. He would get quite mad if I wanted so much as to join a Sunday-school treat. But this time I was set on going, and I would go; for what right had he to prevent? He said the folk were not fit for us to know, when all father’s friends were to be there. And he said that I had nothing fit to wear, when I had my purple plush that I had never so much as taken out of the drawer. At last, when nothing else would do, he went off to France upon the business of the firm, but we went, mother and I, with Mr. Hardy, who used to be our foreman, and it was there I met Mr. Hosmer Angel.”\n“I suppose,” said Holmes, “that when Mr. Windibank came back from France he was very annoyed at your having gone to the ball.”\n“Oh, well, he was very good about it. He laughed, I remember, and shrugged his shoulders, and said there was no use denying anything to a woman, for she would have her way.”\n“I see. Then at the gasfitters’ ball you met, as I understand, a gentleman called Mr. Hosmer Angel.”\n“Yes, sir. I met him that night, and he called next day to ask if we had got home all safe, and after that we met him—that is to say, Mr. Holmes, I met him twice for walks, but after that father came back again, and Mr. Hosmer Angel could not come to the house any more.”\n“No?”\n“Well, you know father didn’t like anything of the sort. He wouldn’t have any visitors if he could help it, and he used to say that a woman should be happy in her own family circle. But then, as I used to say to mother, a woman wants her own circle to begin with, and I had not got mine yet.”\n“But how about Mr. Hosmer Angel? Did he make no attempt to see you?”\n“Well, father was going off to France again in a week, and Hosmer wrote and said that it would be safer and better not to see each other until he had gone. We could write in the meantime, and he used to write every day. I took the letters in in the morning, so there was no need for father to know.”\n“Were you engaged to the gentleman at this time?”\n“Oh, yes, Mr. Holmes. We were engaged after the first walk that we took. Hosmer—Mr. Angel—was a cashier in an office in Leadenhall Street—and—”\n“What office?”\n“That’s the worst of it, Mr. Holmes, I don’t know.”\n“Where did he live, then?”\n“He slept on the premises.”\n“And you don’t know his address?”\n“No—except that it was Leadenhall Street.”\n“Where did you address your letters, then?”\n“To the Leadenhall Street Post Office, to be left till called for. He said that if they were sent to the office he would be chaffed by all the other clerks about having letters from a lady, so I offered to typewrite them, like he did his, but he wouldn’t have that, for he said that when I wrote them they seemed to come from me, but when they were typewritten he always felt that the machine had come between us. That will just show you how fond he was of me, Mr. Holmes, and the little things that he would think of.”\n“It was most suggestive,” said Holmes. “It has long been an axiom of mine that the little things are infinitely the most important. Can you remember any other little things about Mr. Hosmer Angel?”\n“He was a very shy man, Mr. Holmes. He would rather walk with me in the evening than in the daylight, for he said that he hated to be conspicuous. Very retiring and gentlemanly he was. Even his voice was gentle. He’d had the quinsy and swollen glands when he was young, he told me, and it had left him with a weak throat, and a hesitating, whispering fashion of speech. He was always well dressed, very neat and plain, but his eyes were weak, just as mine are, and he wore tinted glasses against the glare.”",

They give a ball, and anyone who likes may go. My poor father was a gasfitter and he had some friends of the sort. We got tickets from them. My stepfather is a man of very retiring habits, and he does not like my going to any place of amusement. He did not like the idea of my going to this ball at all. He said that it was not the sort of place that young ladies should go to. But I had set my heart upon it. My father had been a friend of the foreman, and he had got tickets for us. I insisted upon going, and at last he said that I might go if my mother went with me. My mother is a very quiet woman, and she does what he tells her. But we had a friend, Mr. Hardy, who used to be our foreman, and he offered to take us. My stepfather was very much against it, but at last he consented. He went to France upon business just at that time, and so we went to the ball with Mr. Hardy. It was there that I met Mr. Hosmer Angel.” “And did you meet him again?” “Yes, sir. He called next day at the office. He was a very shy man, Mr. Holmes, very shy indeed, but very gentle. I liked him from the first. He was a cashier in a office in Leadenhall Street. He was a very quiet man, but he had a sweet voice. He told me that he had been very ill with quinsy when he was a child, and that had made his voice like it was. He was a very neat man, and he wore tinted glasses.” “Did you see him often?” “Yes, Mr. Holmes. We met twice for walks, but after that my stepfather came back from France, and he did not like my going out. He is a very strict man, and he thinks that a woman should be at home. He does not like anyone coming to the house, and he thinks that a young lady should not have any friends but her own family. I have no friends of my own, and I should like to have a social circle. But my stepfather does not like it. He was going to France again in a week, and Mr. Angel wrote to me and said that it would be better if we did not meet until he had gone. He said that we could write to each other every day, and that he would get the letters at the Leadenhall Street Post Office, ‘to be left till called for.’ He said that he did not like to have them sent to the office, for fear of being chaffed by the other clerks. I offered to typewrite my letters, as he did his, but he would not have it. He said that he liked to see my own handwriting. That was the first time that we had written, though we had been engaged for a week.” “Were you engaged then?” “Yes, Mr. Holmes. We were engaged after the first walk that we took. He was a very dear man.” “You say that he was a cashier in an office in Leadenhall Street. What office was it?” “That I cannot tell you, sir. I know that he was a cashier, but I do not know the name of the firm. I know that he slept on the premises, and that he was a bachelor.” “And did you ever ask him for his address?” “No, sir. He was so shy that I did not like to ask him. But I know that he was a cashier in Leadenhall Street.” “And you say that he wrote to you every day?” “Yes, sir. Every day.” “And you got the letters at the Post Office?” “Yes, sir.” “Thank you. I think that I have all that I want. It is a very strange case, and I have no doubt that I shall be able to clear it up. You say that he wrote to you every day, and that he got the letters at the Post Office. Did you ever see him at the Post Office?” “No, sir. He said that he would get them himself.” “And you say that he was a very shy man?” “Yes, sir, very shy.” “And he wore tinted glasses?” “Yes, sir.” “And he had a sweet voice?” “Yes, sir.” “And he was a cashier in Leadenhall Street?” “Yes, sir.” “And he slept on the premises?” “Yes, sir.” “And he was a bachelor?” “Yes, sir.” “Thank you.

He was in dreadful earnest and made me swear, with my hands on the Testament, that whatever happened I would always be true to him. Mother said he was quite right to make me swear, and that it was a sign of his passion. Mother was all in his favour from the first and was even fonder of him than I was. Then, when they talked of marrying within the week, I began to ask about father; but they both said never to mind about father, but just to tell him afterwards, and mother said she would make it all right with him. I didn’t quite like that, Mr. Holmes. It seemed funny that I should ask his leave, as he was only a few years older than me; but I didn’t want to do anything on the sly, so I wrote to father at Bordeaux, where the company has its French offices, but the letter came back to me on the very morning of the wedding.”\n“It missed him, then?”\n“Yes, sir; for he had started to England just before it arrived.”\n“Ha! that was unfortunate. Your wedding was arranged, then, for the Friday. Was it to be in church?”\n“Yes, sir, but very quietly. It was to be at St. Saviour’s, near King’s Cross, and we were to have breakfast afterwards at the St. Pancras Hotel. Hosmer came for us in a hansom, but as there were two of us he put us both into it and stepped himself into a four-wheeler, which happened to be the only other cab in the street. We got to the church first, and when the four-wheeler drove up we waited for him to step out, but he never did, and when the cabman got down from the box and looked there was no one there! The cabman said that he could not imagine what had become of him, for he had seen him get in with his own eyes. That was last Friday, Mr. Holmes, and I have never seen or heard anything since then to throw any light upon what became of him.”\n“It seems to me that you have been very shamefully treated,” said Holmes.\n“Oh, no, sir! He was too good and kind to leave me so. Why, all the morning he was saying to me that, whatever happened, I was to be true; and that even if something quite unforeseen occurred to separate us, I was always to remember that I was pledged to him, and that he would claim his pledge sooner or later. It seemed strange talk for a wedding-morning, but what has happened since gives a meaning to it.”\n“Most certainly it does. Your own opinion is, then, that some unforeseen catastrophe has occurred to him?”\n“Yes, sir. I believe that he foresaw some danger, or else he would not have talked so. And then I think that what he foresaw happened.”\n“But you have no notion as to what it could have been?”\n“None.”\n“One more question. How did your mother take the matter?”\n“She was angry, and said that I was never to speak of the matter again.”\n“And your father? Did you tell him?”\n“Yes; and he seemed to think, with me, that something had happened, and that I should hear of Hosmer again. As he said, what interest could anyone have in bringing me to the doors of the church, and then leaving me? Now, if he had borrowed my money, or if he had married me and got my money settled on him, there might be some reason, but Hosmer was very independent about money and never would look at a shilling of mine. And yet, what could have happened? And why could he not write? Oh, it drives me half-mad to think of it, and I can’t sleep a wink at night.” She pulled a little handkerchief out of her muff and began to sob heavily into it.",

We did not say anything to him about it, for mother and I both thought that it would be time enough when the marriage was actually fixed. On the Tuesday evening before the Friday that was fixed for the wedding, Hosmer Angel came to supper. He said that he never liked to be away from me for a single day. He was just as fond of me as ever, and we sat planning out our lives, and he was assuring me on his Bible oath that whatever happened he would always be true.”\n“He said this, did he?”\n“Yes, and mother heard him. Then he said that for some reason, which he could not explain just then, it was absolutely necessary that we should be married at once, and that it would be impossible for him to come back to the house again. He begged us to be married on the Friday. The mother was quite agreeable, for she came to love Hosmer Angel quite as much as I did, and she thought that everything was for the best. She said that I had never had control of my own money, and that of course, since Hosmer was a partner in the business, he would not wish to say anything about the marriage just at present.”\n“And your stepfather?”\n“She said she would manage him, but that we ought to do the thing at once. We were to be married at St. Saviour’s, King’s Cross, and thence go on to the St. Pancras Hotel, where a breakfast was ordered. Hosmer Angel came for us in a hansom, but as there were two of us, he put us both into it, and stepped himself into a four-wheeler which happened to be just behind. We got to the church first, and when the four-wheeler drove up we waited for him to step out, but he never did, and when the cabman got down from the box and opened the door, there was no one there! The cabman said that he was sure that he had seen him get in. It was only last Friday, sir, and I have heard nothing of him since. There is his ring, and here is his very own letter.”\nHolmes passed the letter to Watson, and then asked to see the ring.\n“This is a very ordinary gold wedding-ring,” he remarked. “I should like to know where it came from.”\n“I should think it came from the jeweller’s,” said Miss Sutherland simply.\n“Exactly! So it did. What jeweller’s?”\n“Not that I know of, sir. I never asked.”\n“You never asked his origin, then?”\n“No, nor his occupation.”\nHolmes sat with his head thrown back and his eyes half closed.\n“My dear young lady,” he exclaimed, “you really are exceedingly simple.”\n“I don’t care who knows,” said she defiantly. “I was to have been married, and if I was deserted it was not my fault.”\n“I should make inquiries as to this Hosmer Angel,” said Holmes.\n“I have done all I can,” she answered. “I have been to every place where I thought that I could hear word of him, and I have not heard a whisper. There is not a soul who can tell me anything of him, and I am half distracted with my fears.”\n“Had he any friends?”\n“I never heard him mention them.”\n“Any relations?”\n“I never heard him mention them either.”\n“His address?”\n“He would never tell us where he lived.

Then he took down from the rack the old and oily clay pipe, which was to him as a counsellor, and, having lit it, he leaned back in his chair, with the thick blue cloud-wreaths spinning up from him, and a look of infinite languor in his face.\n“Quite an interesting study, that maiden,” he observed. “I found her more interesting than her little problem, which, by the way, is rather a trite one. You will find parallel cases, if you consult my index, in Andover in ’77, and there was something of the sort at The Hague last year. Old as is the idea, however, there were one or two details which were new to me. But the maiden herself was most instructive.”\n“You appeared to read a good deal upon her which was quite invisible to me,” I remarked.\n“Not invisible but unnoticed, Watson. You did not know where to look, and so you missed all that was important. I can never bring you to realise the importance of sleeves, the suggestiveness of thumb-nails, or the great issues that may hang from a boot-lace. Now, what did you gather from that woman’s appearance? Describe it.”\n“Well, she had a slate-coloured, broad-brimmed straw hat, with a feather of a brickish red. Her jacket was black, with black beads sewn upon it, and a fringe of little black jet ornaments. Her dress was brown, rather darker than coffee colour, with a little purple plush at the neck and sleeves. Her gloves were greyish and were worn through at the right forefinger. Her boots I didn’t observe. She had small round, hanging gold earrings, and a general air of being fairly well-to-do in a vulgar, comfortable, easy-going way.”\nSherlock Holmes clapped his hands softly together and chuckled.\n“’Pon my word, Watson, you are coming along wonderfully. You have really done very well indeed. It is true that you have missed everything of importance, but you have hit upon the method, and you have a quick eye for colour. Never trust to general impressions, my boy, but concentrate yourself upon details. My first glance is always at a woman’s sleeve. In a man it is perhaps better first to take the knee of the trouser. As you observe, this woman had plush upon her sleeves, which is a most useful material for showing traces. The double line a little above the wrist, where the typewritist presses against the table, was beautifully defined. The sewing-machine, of the hand type, leaves a similar mark, but only on the left arm, and on the side of it farthest from the thumb, instead of being right across the broadest part, as this was. I then glanced at her face, and, observing the dint of a pince-nez at either side of her nose, I ventured a remark upon short sight and typewriting, which seemed to surprise her.”\n“It surprised me.”\n“But, surely, it was obvious. I was then much surprised and interested on glancing down to observe that, though the boots which she was wearing were not unlike each other, they were really odd ones; the one having a slightly decorated toe-cap, and the other a plain one. One was buttoned only in the two lower buttons out of five, and the other at the first, third, and fifth. Now, when you see that a young lady, otherwise neatly dressed, has come away from home with odd boots, half-buttoned, it is no great deduction to say that she came away in a hurry.”\n“And what else?” I asked, keenly interested, as I always was, by my friend’s incisive reasoning.\n“I noted, in passing, that she had written a note before leaving home but after being fully dressed. You observed that her right glove was torn at the forefinger, but you did not apparently see that both glove and finger were stained with violet ink. She had written in a hurry and dipped her pen too deep. It must have been this morning, or the mark would not remain clear upon the finger. All this is amusing, though rather elementary, but I must go back to business, Watson. Would you mind reading me the advertised description of Mr. Hosmer Angel?”",

Then he took his clay pipe from the rack, and, having lit it, he leaned back in his chair, with the thick blue cloud curling up from the bowl and drifting in wreaths towards the ceiling. 'I confess that you have acted very wisely in coming to me,' he remarked. 'The small points upon which you desired clarification are now, I imagine, fairly clear to you, although there are many more which are not yet clear to me. Now, as to this young lady's story, you will not, of course, publish it. It is just one of those pretty little problems which come at times to the analyst, and which are exceedingly interesting, just because they are so exceedingly trivial. Why, my dear Watson, there is hardly a crime in the London Directory for which I could not find a parallel in the annals of my crimes, save perhaps some fantastic ones. This is an old problem, and yet it presents some new features.' 'You will find it in my notes of the year '77, under the head of \"Gardener.\" I have also had occasion to study it in the case of the \"Dutchman,\" which was complicated by the presence of a third party. But the woman herself is a most instructive study. I confess that I have seldom met with a case which presents so many interesting features.' 'I confess that I could not see what you seemed to read upon her,' I remarked. 'I have no doubt that I am very dull, but I could not see anything remarkable about the lady save that she was a very amiable and good-natured person.' 'You did not know where to look, and so you missed all that was important. I can never bring you to realize the importance of sleeves, the suggestiveness of thumbnails, or the great issues that may hang upon a boot-lace. Now, what did you observe yourself, Watson?' 'I observed that her hat was a black straw, trimmed with a purple velvet band, and a bird's wing, cut off at the shoulder. Her jacket was black, with a white frill at the neck and wrists. Her dress was a brown merino, trimmed with a fringe of the same colour. Her gloves were of a light drab colour, and were much torn at the right forefinger. Her boots were of a dark brown, and were much worn at the toes. She had a pair of earrings in her ears, and a gold chain round her neck. Her general appearance was that of a person of the middle class, well-to-do, but not wealthy.' Holmes chuckled. 'Upon my word, Watson, you are improving. You have a good eye for colour, and you are not afraid of a little detail. But you missed everything that was important. I could tell from the first glance at her sleeves that she was a typewritist. Look at the plush upon the cuffs. It is worn in a peculiar way. This is the mark of the machine. There is a double line near the wrist, where the plush is worn away, and the cloth is frayed. This is the mark of the carriage. It is not the mark of a sewing machine, for that is a single line. Then I noticed that she had a pince-nez, and that she had been wearing it for some time, for there was a mark upon her nose. This led me to the conclusion that she was short-sighted, and that she was a typewritist. I was surprised to see that her boots were odd. One was a dark brown, and the other was a light brown. They were also half-buttoned, and the buttons were of different colours. This showed me that she had been in a great hurry when she dressed. She had also written a note after she had dressed, and before she had left the house. This I deduced from the fact that there was a stain of violet ink upon her torn right glove, and also upon her forefinger. It was a deep stain, and it had been applied in a great hurry.

Then he took his clay pipe from the rack, and, having lit it, he leaned back in his chair, with the thick blue cloud curling up from the bowl and drifting in wreaths towards the ceiling. 'I confess that you have acted very wisely in coming to me,' he remarked. 'The small points upon which you desired clarification are now, I imagine, fairly clear to you, although there are many more which are not yet clear to me. Now, as to this young lady's story, you will not, of course, publish it. It is just one of those pretty little problems which come at times to the analyst, and which are exceedingly interesting, just because they are so exceedingly trivial. Why, my dear Watson, there is hardly a crime in the London Directory for which I could not find a parallel in the annals of my crimes, save perhaps some fantastic ones. This is an old problem, and yet it presents some new features.' 'You will find it in my notes of the year '77, under the head of \"Gardener.\" I have also had occasion to study it in the case of the \"Dutchman,\" which was complicated by the presence of a third party. But the woman herself is a most instructive study. I confess that I have seldom met with a case which presents so many interesting features.' 'I confess that I could not see what you seemed to read upon her,' I remarked. 'I have no doubt that I am very dull, but I could not see anything remarkable about the lady save that she was a very amiable and good-natured person.' 'You did not know where to look, and so you missed all that was important. I can never bring you to realize the importance of sleeves, the suggestiveness of thumbnails, or the great issues that may hang upon a boot-lace. Now, what did you observe yourself, Watson?' 'I observed that her hat was a black straw, trimmed with a purple velvet band, and a bird's wing, cut off at the shoulder. Her jacket was black, with a white frill at the neck and wrists. Her dress was a brown merino, trimmed with a fringe of the same colour. Her gloves were of a light drab colour, and were much torn at the right forefinger. Her boots were of a dark brown, and were much worn at the toes. She had a pair of earrings in her ears, and a gold chain round her neck. Her general appearance was that of a person of the middle class, well-to-do, but not wealthy.' Holmes chuckled. 'Upon my word, Watson, you are improving.

Absolutely no clue in them to Mr. Angel, save that he quotes Balzac once. There is one remarkable point, however, which will no doubt strike you.”\n“They are typewritten,” I remarked.\n“Not only that, but the signature is typewritten. Look at the neat little ‘Hosmer Angel’ at the bottom. There is a date, you see, but no superscription except Leadenhall Street, which is rather vague. The point about the signature is very suggestive—in fact, we may call it conclusive.”\n“Of what?”\n“My dear fellow, is it possible you do not see how strongly it bears upon the case?”\n“I cannot say that I do unless it were that he wished to be able to deny his signature if an action for breach of promise were instituted.”\n“No, that was not the point. However, I shall write two letters, which should settle the matter. One is to a firm in the City, the other is to the young lady’s stepfather, Mr. Windibank, asking him whether he could meet us here at six o’clock to-morrow evening. It is just as well that we should do business with the male relatives.

Until then, adieu, my own dear girl. Ever yours, Hosmer Angel.’ What do you make of that, Watson?”\n\n“Why, it gives the very hour.”\n\n“It gives the hour. But it gives us something more, Watson.

Well, Watson, what do you make of it?

A man who carries on a clandestine correspondence of this sort, and gives addresses which cannot be properly verified, and then signs his letters with a typewriter, is surely a suspicious character.”\n\n“But why should he type his signature?”\n\n“It is just what I should most desire to ascertain, and it may give us the very clue that we want.

                "text": "I held the little printed slip to the light. “Missing,” I read, “a gentleman of the name of Hosmer Angel. About five feet seven inches in height, strongly built, sallow complexion, black hair, a little bald in the centre, bushy black whiskers, and moustache; tinted glasses, slight infirmity of speech, said to have been employed as a clerk in the office of Mawson & Williams, Cross Street, Leadenhall Street. Dressed in a black frock-coat, dark trousers, and a black silk hat. Thirteenth of October, just after eight o’clock in the evening. Was on his way to the address of the lady to whom he was engaged to be married, and has been heard of since. The description is imperfect, but is all that we have to go upon. There is a reward of five pounds.”\n\n“Draw your chair up, and hand me my slippers,” said Holmes. “I perceive that you have already heard the main facts of the case from Miss Sutherland. I had them from her just before you came in. She was in a pitiable state of distress, as you can imagine. So you have read the advertisement, too?”\n\n“Yes, I clipped it out and brought it away with me.”\n\n“Well, Watson, what do you make of it?”\n\n“It seems to me to be a very ordinary case of a commonplace disappearance.”\n\n“Pray do not say so. The case is interesting, inasmuch as it presents several novel features. You will observe that there is a reward offered, and yet the advertisement is so worded that one would imagine that the lady still hopes for the return of the missing gentleman. It is strange that she should do this when he has deserted her in so heartless a fashion.”\n\n“She thinks that he may have been decoyed away.”\n\n“It is possible, no doubt. The girl’s story was most instructive. You will find it in my notes, and I shall read it to you. So far as I have gathered the facts, they are these: Miss Mary Sutherland is a lady of twenty-six, not bad-looking, though short-sighted to an extreme degree. She was an only child, and her mother was a widow, who had married a second time a fellow named Windibank, a plumber and gasfitter, living at Lower Brixton. Windibank is a man of character, but a bully at home, and he was a good deal older than his wife, who was a quiet, amiable woman. Mary Sutherland had inherited some money from a uncle, and this money was left to her in such a way that it passed into her own control when she came of age. She had twenty-five hundred pounds, and the interest of this, at four per cent, was a hundred a year. She lived at home with her mother and stepfather, and she does not seem to have had any friends or acquaintances. She was a quiet, retiring girl, and she had no opportunities of meeting young men. She was, however, a member of a literary society, and it was at a meeting of this society that she met the missing man, Hosmer Angel. They sat together, and he walked home with her. He called next day, and in a few weeks they were engaged. Windibank, the stepfather, was very much against the match, but the mother was in favour of it, and the girl was determined to have her own way. The wedding was fixed for the thirteenth of October. On that morning, however, Hosmer Angel did not turn up. He had gone off, and has not been heard of since. That is the story, Watson, in a nutshell.”\n\n“And what is your theory?”\n\n“Well, I have several theories, but I have not yet been able to make up my mind as to which is the correct one. I confess that I am not very sanguine about the matter. It is a very common case of a young man who has been engaged to a girl, and has then thought better of it, and has bolted. I have seen several such cases in my time.”\n\n“But the girl says that he was a very amiable man, and that he was very much in love with her.”\n\n“",

I confess that the Irene Adler case still rankled in my mind. I thought of the sardonic smile with which he had recounted the discomfiture of the King of Bohemia. That was a woman who had baffled him—the only one, he said, that ever did. But at least he had hersafeguarded his reputation by the magnificent handling with which he had redeemed his failure. Let the Dulwich affair be as it may, in the Sign of Four, in the Study in Scarlet, in the Adventure of the Speckled Band, and in that of the Red-headed League, he had gained such successes as made them all forgotten. ‘“It is true that you have had some disappointments,” I remarked. “But you are a young man yet. You will get your chance.” “I can but try,” he answered. “I can but try.”’ I had no doubt that in this case also he would come out with flying colours. I left him smoking his pipe with an air of serene confidence which was infectious. I felt that the matter was in such good hands that it would be sure to come right.\n\nAn urgent case called me away from my own practice, and my whole day was spent in the East End. On my return in the evening I found Holmes in the sitting-room, sunk in a drowsy reverie, and surrounded by such a smell of chemicals as would almost overpower a less hardy visitor. He was seated with his nose in a test-tube, and his eyes half closed, with the air of a connoisseur who is tasting some choice vintage.\n\"\"\"\n```",

I am afraid that I am a little late, but I am not quite my own master, you know. I am sorry that Miss Sutherland has troubled you about this little matter, for I think it is far better not to wash linen of the sort in public. It was quite against my wishes that she came, but she is a very excitable, impulsive girl, as you may have noticed, and she is not easily controlled when she has made up her mind on a point. Of course, I did not mind you so much, as you are not connected with the official police, but it is not pleasant to have a family misfortune like this noised abroad. Besides, it is a useless expense, for how could you possibly find this Hosmer Angel?”\n“On the contrary,” said Holmes quietly; “I have every reason to believe that I will succeed in discovering Mr. Hosmer Angel.”\nMr. Windibank gave a violent start and dropped his gloves. “I am delighted to hear it,” he said.\n“It is a curious thing,” remarked Holmes, “that a typewriter has really quite as much individuality as a man’s handwriting. Unless they are quite new, no two of them write exactly alike. Some letters get more worn than others, and some wear only on one side. Now, you remark in this note of yours, Mr. Windibank, that in every case there is some little slurring over of the ‘e,’ and a slight defect in the tail of the ‘r.’ There are fourteen other characteristics, but those are the more obvious.”\n“We do all our correspondence with this machine at the office, and no doubt it is a little worn,” our visitor answered, glancing keenly at Holmes with his bright little eyes.\n“And now I will show you what is really a very interesting study, Mr. Windibank,” Holmes continued. “I think of writing another little monograph some of these days on the typewriter and its relation to crime. It is a subject to which I have devoted some little attention. I have here four letters which purport to come from the missing man. They are all typewritten. In each case, not only are the ‘e’s’ slurred and the ‘r’s’ tailless, but you will observe, if you care to use my magnifying lens, that the fourteen other characteristics to which I have alluded are there as well.”",

I confess that I am not surprised that your stepdaughter should have been so anxious to consult me.” “She is a silly, headstrong girl,” said he. “She will live to regret it.” “Indeed,” said Holmes. “Then you are not of opinion that she has been poorly used?” “I think that it is unfortunate that she should have been so deceived.” “Ah, I see that you are of my opinion. You would not desire, then, that I should prosecute my inquiries any further?” “I have no wish either way. It is she who insists upon it.

Holmes stuck his feet up on the corner of the mantelpiece and, leaning back with his hands in his pockets, began talking, rather to himself, as it seemed, than to us.\n“The man married a woman very much older than himself for her money,” said he, “and he enjoyed the use of the money of the daughter as long as she lived with them. It was a considerable sum, for people in their position, and the loss of it would have made a serious difference. It was worth an effort to preserve it. The daughter was of a good, amiable disposition, but affectionate and warm-hearted in her ways, so that it was evident that with her fair personal advantages, and her little income, she would not be allowed to remain single long. Now her marriage would mean, of course, the loss of a hundred a year, so what does her stepfather do to prevent it? He takes the obvious course of keeping her at home and forbidding her to seek the company of people of her own age. But soon he found that that would not answer forever. She became restive, insisted upon her rights, and finally announced her positive intention of going to a certain ball. What does her clever stepfather do then? He conceives an idea more creditable to his head than to his heart. With the connivance and assistance of his wife he disguised himself, covered those keen eyes with tinted glasses, masked the face with a moustache and a pair of bushy whiskers, sunk that clear voice into an insinuating whisper, and doubly secure on account of the girl’s short sight, he appears as Mr. Hosmer Angel, and keeps off other lovers by making love himself.”\n“It was only a joke at first,” groaned our visitor. “We never thought that she would have been so carried away.”\n“Very likely not. However that may be, the young lady was very decidedly carried away, and, having quite made up her mind that her stepfather was in France, the suspicion of treachery never for an instant entered her mind. She was flattered by the gentleman’s attentions, and the effect was increased by the loudly expressed admiration of her mother. Then Mr. Angel began to call, for it was obvious that the matter should be pushed as far as it would go if a real effect were to be produced. There were meetings, and an engagement, which would finally secure the girl’s affections from turning towards anyone else. But the deception could not be kept up forever. These pretended journeys to France were rather cumbrous. The thing to do was clearly to bring the business to an end in such a dramatic manner that it would leave a permanent impression upon the young lady’s mind and prevent her from looking upon any other suitor for some time to come. Hence those vows of fidelity exacted upon a Testament, and hence also the allusions to a possibility of something happening on the very morning of the wedding. James Windibank wished Miss Sutherland to be so bound to Hosmer Angel, and so uncertain as to his fate, that for ten years to come, at any rate, she would not listen to another man. As far as the church door he brought her, and then, as he could go no farther, he conveniently vanished away by the old trick of stepping in at one door of a four-wheeler and out at the other. I think that was the chain of events, Mr. Windibank!”",

His hands, large and powerful, were clasped together with a desperate rigidity, the knuckles standing out white and prominent. A thick, grey dust lay upon his shoulders and the brim of his hat, which lay neglected on the floor beside him, suggesting a long and weary journey. His clothes, though of good material, were rumpled and stained, speaking of hardship rather than mere carelessness. The very air around him seemed heavy with despair. It was a raw, foggy morning in November, and the gloom outside seemed to have seeped into our very room at 221B Baker Street, settling upon this unfortunate visitor. Sherlock Holmes sat opposite him, his long, lean figure coiled in his armchair, his eyes, bright and penetrating, fixed upon the man with an intensity that seemed almost surgical. He said nothing, merely observed, his fingers steepled before his chin, a faint, almost imperceptible smile playing about the corners of his lips – the smile of a craftsman contemplating a complex piece of machinery. I, meanwhile, felt a profound wave of sympathy for the poor wretch. His face, when he occasionally lifted it, was a study in misery – lined and drawn, with eyes that held a haunted, faraway look. There was a tremor in his lower lip that he seemed unable to control. \"A bad business, Holmes,\" I ventured at last, unable to bear the silence any longer. Holmes nodded slowly, his gaze never leaving the man. \"Indeed, Watson. A very bad business. Observe the set of the jaw, despite the evident collapse of spirit. There is resolution there, buried deep. And the hands – the calluses, the ingrained dirt beneath the nails, the sheer size and strength. Not a clerk, Watson, nor a professional man of sedentary habits. A man who works with his hands, and works hard. A labourer, perhaps, or a craftsman of some heavy trade.\" He paused, his eyes scanning the man's boots. \"Ah, and recently, a traveller. See the state of his boots, Watson? The thick mud, dried and cracked, is not of London clay. It has a reddish tint, suggestive of the soil found in the Home Counties, perhaps to the north or west. And the wear on the soles speaks of many miles covered on foot.\" The man stirred slightly at the sound of our voices, but did not raise his head. A low groan escaped his lips. \"He is in deep waters, Watson,\" Holmes murmured, leaning forward slightly. \"The dust, the fatigue, the profound dejection – it all points to a sudden, overwhelming calamity that has struck him down and driven him here in haste. He has not slept, I warrant, for at least forty-eight hours. The eyes are bloodshot, the skin sallow and stretched tight over the bones.\" He picked up a magnifying glass from the table beside him and examined the man's coat sleeve. \"Curious,\" he murmured. \"Traces of straw and something that looks remarkably like sawdust. A farm labourer, then, who has perhaps also spent time in a carpenter's yard? The plot thickens.\" He put down the glass and addressed the man directly, his voice gentle but firm. \"My dear sir,\" he said. \"You are in distress. Pray tell us your story. Whatever your burden, it is possible that two heads are better than one, and my friend and I are ready to listen and, if possible, to help.\" The man finally raised his head, his eyes meeting Holmes's with a flicker of desperate hope. His voice, when he spoke, was hoarse and broken, as if unused for a long time. \"Mr. Holmes,\" he whispered, the words seeming to tear their way out of his throat. \"They told me you were the one... the only one who could understand. I am ruined, sir. Utterly, completely ruined. And it was all because of a simple mistake... a moment of madness...\" He trailed off, his gaze falling back to his clasped hands, the weight of his sorrow pressing down upon him once more.

I have done nothing actionable from the first, but as long as you keep that door locked you lay yourself open to an action for assault and illegal constraint.”\n“The law cannot, as you say, touch you,” said Holmes, unlocking and throwing open the door, “yet there never was a man who deserved punishment more. If the young lady has a brother or a friend, he ought to lay a whip across your shoulders. By Jove!” he continued, flushing up at the sight of the bitter sneer upon the man’s face, “it is not part of my duties to my client, but here’s a hunting crop handy, and I think I shall just treat myself to—” He took two swift steps to the whip, but before he could grasp it there was a wild clatter of steps upon the stairs, the heavy hall door banged, and from the window we could see Mr. James Windibank running at the top of his speed down the road.\n“There’s a cold-blooded scoundrel!” said Holmes, laughing, as he threw himself down into his chair once more. “That fellow will rise from crime to crime until he does something very bad, and ends on a gallows. The case has, in some respects, been not entirely devoid of interest.”\n“I cannot now entirely see all the steps of your reasoning,” I remarked.\n“Well, of course it was obvious from the first that this Mr. Hosmer Angel must have some strong object for his curious conduct, and it was equally clear that the only man who really profited by the incident, as far as we could see, was the stepfather. Then the fact that the two men were never together, but that the one always appeared when the other was away, was suggestive. So were the tinted spectacles and the curious voice, which both hinted at a disguise, as did the bushy whiskers. My suspicions were all confirmed by his peculiar action in typewriting his signature, which, of course, inferred that his handwriting was so familiar to her that she would recognise even the smallest sample of it. You see all these isolated facts, together with many minor ones, all pointed in the same direction.”\n“And how did you verify them?”\n“Having once spotted my man, it was easy to get corroboration. I knew the firm for which this man worked. Having taken the printed description. I eliminated everything from it which could be the result of a disguise—the whiskers, the glasses, the voice, and I sent it to the firm, with a request that they would inform me whether it answered to the description of any of their travellers. I had already noticed the peculiarities of the typewriter, and I wrote to the man himself at his business address asking him if he would come here. As I expected, his reply was typewritten and revealed the same trivial but characteristic defects. The same post brought me a letter from Westhouse & Marbank, of Fenchurch Street, to say that the description tallied in every respect with that of their employé, James Windibank. Voilà tout!”\n“And Miss Sutherland?”\n“If I tell her she will not believe me. You may remember the old Persian saying, ‘There is danger for him who taketh the tiger cub, and danger also for whoso snatches a delusion from a woman.’ There is as much sense in Hafiz as in Horace, and as much knowledge of the world.”",

I eliminated everyone near her who could by any possibility be so interested. I came down to the stepfather as the only man who could profit by a deception of this kind. Then I had to consider the manner in which the deception was carried out. It was essential that this Mr. Angel should be an absolutely real person, or that the lady should believe him to be so. It was also essential that the father should appear to have strained every nerve to find him, and that he should be able to account in the most satisfactory manner for the disappearance of the gentleman. Finally, it was essential that, if he reappeared, the lady’s affections should be thoroughly alienated from him. Deducting the lady’s evidence, and everything which could be the result of a preconceived idea, what remained? The facts that the gentleman was always with the lady when the father was away, and never when he was at home; that he spoke in a husky, disguised voice; that his face was half hidden by a beard; that there was a peculiar twirl of his hair, and, finally, that his signature was a peculiar one. These were the points which remained, and the net result of them was that the gentleman would seem to be a person who had no wish to be recognised by the father. The suspicion that they were one and the same person was strong from the beginning, but I desired to have it converted into a certainty. Therefore, I enquired at Messrs. Westhouse & Marbank as to the gentleman’s character, and I sent a description of him, with such details as might identify him. I learned that a gentleman of the name of James Windibank was in their employ, but that he was exceedingly short-sighted, and wore glasses. The lady’s description of the courtship of Mr. Angel coincided with this. The gentleman brought down a note written upon the notepaper of Messrs. Westhouse & Marbank. He had, I presume, an accomplice in the office, who wrote the body of the note, and he added a few words himself, either in a disguised hand or with an ink which seemed to have faded. I then wrote to Mr. Windibank to ask him whether he could throw any light upon the disappearance of Mr. Hosmer Angel. I sent the note to his business address, and I waited a reply. I wrote with a typewriter, and I asked him to answer with the same. Imagine my surprise when the letter came back, and the address was typewritten, and the signature was typewritten. Examine it closely and you will see that it is all in the same machine, every letter corresponds, and every flaw is to be found in the two documents. Add to this the facts that the man was short-sighted and I was myself witness to the ring of whiskers, and you have a conclusive proof of the identity of these two gentlemen.

If you were in Brazil, or anywhere else where the laws are not so strict, I might possibly trouble you for insulting me as you have done.

It was never meant to punish fools; it was meant to restrain rogues. But, friend, you are raising up a power in the community which will teach you that there are higher laws than those of parchment and of statute. The woman whom you have wronged was your late wife’s daughter. She is a woman who is as sensitive as she is loving and pure.

Mary Morstan, my wife, took it and glanced at the address. “It is from Sherlock Holmes,” she said. I took it from her hand and tore it open. The message was brief and urgent: “Come at once if convenient—if inconvenient come all the same.—SH.” I knew what that meant. Holmes never telegraphed unless the matter was of importance. My wife smiled. She was accustomed to these sudden calls upon my time and understood that when Holmes needed me, there was no question of convenience. “I suppose I must go,” I said, though there was no reluctance in my voice. The prospect of assisting Holmes in one of his fascinating investigations always thrilled me. I rose from the table, leaving my breakfast unfinished. “Give my regards to Mr. Holmes,” Mary said. I promised I would and hurried to get ready. Within ten minutes, I was in a hansom cab rattling towards Baker Street. I found Holmes pacing his room, his pipe in his mouth, a look of keen interest on his face. Seated opposite him was a young man, whose appearance instantly arrested my attention. He was pale and agitated, and his right hand was swathed in a bandage, from which blood was slowly oozing. It was clear that I had arrived just in time, not merely as a chronicler of Holmes's exploits, but as a medical man. The young man looked up as I entered, his face etched with pain and bewilderment. Holmes introduced him as Mr. Victor Hatherley, a hydraulic engineer. “You are just in time, Watson,” said Holmes. “Our friend here has"

I have not seen a paper for some days.”\n“The London press has not had very full accounts. I have just been looking through all the recent papers in order to master the particulars. It seems, from what I gather, to be one of those simple cases which are so extremely difficult.”\n“That sounds a little paradoxical.”\n“But it is profoundly true. Singularity is almost invariably a clue. The more featureless and commonplace a crime is, the more difficult it is to bring it home. In this case, however, they have established a very serious case against the son of the murdered man.”\n“It is a murder, then?”\n“Well, it is conjectured to be so. I shall take nothing for granted until I have the opportunity of looking personally into it. I will explain the state of things to you, as far as I have been able to understand it, in a very few words.\n“Boscombe Valley is a country district not very far from Ross, in Herefordshire. The largest landed proprietor in that part is a Mr. John Turner, who made his money in Australia and returned some years ago to the old country. One of the farms which he held, that of Hatherley, was let to Mr. Charles McCarthy, who was also an ex-Australian. The men had known each other in the colonies, so that it was not unnatural that when they came to settle down they should do so as near each other as possible. Turner was apparently the richer man, so McCarthy became his tenant but still remained, it seems, upon terms of perfect equality, as they were frequently together. McCarthy had one son, a lad of eighteen, and Turner had an only daughter of the same age, but neither of them had wives living. They appear to have avoided the society of the neighbouring English families and to have led retired lives, though both the McCarthys were fond of sport and were frequently seen at the race-meetings of the neighbourhood. McCarthy kept two servants—a man and a girl. Turner had a considerable household, some half-dozen at the least. That is as much as I have been able to gather about the families. Now for the facts.\n“On June 3rd, that is, on Monday last, McCarthy left his house at Hatherley about three in the afternoon and walked down to the Boscombe Pool, which is a small lake formed by the spreading out of the stream which runs down the Boscombe Valley. He had been out with his serving-man in the morning at Ross, and he had told the man that he must hurry, as he had an appointment of importance to keep at three. From that appointment he never came back alive.\n“From Hatherley Farmhouse to the Boscombe Pool is a quarter of a mile, and two people saw him as he passed over this ground. One was an old woman, whose name is not mentioned, and the other was William Crowder, a game-keeper in the employ of Mr. Turner. Both these witnesses depose that Mr. McCarthy was walking alone. The game-keeper adds that within a few minutes of his seeing Mr. McCarthy pass he had seen his son, Mr. James McCarthy, going the same way with a gun under his arm. To the best of his belief, the father was actually in sight at the time, and the son was following him. He thought no more of the matter until he heard in the evening of the tragedy that had occurred.\n“The two McCarthys were seen after the time when William Crowder, the game-keeper, lost sight of them. The Boscombe Pool is thickly wooded round, with just a fringe of grass and of reeds round the edge. A girl of fourteen, Patience Moran, who is the daughter of the lodge-keeper of the Boscombe Valley estate, was in one of the woods picking flowers. She states that while she was there she saw, at the border of the wood and close by the lake, Mr. McCarthy and his son, and that they appeared to be having a violent quarrel. She heard Mr. McCarthy the elder using very strong language to his son, and she saw the latter raise up his hand as if to strike his father. She was so frightened by their violence that she ran away and told her mother when she reached home that she had left the two McCarthys quarrelling near Boscombe Pool, and that she was afraid that they were going to fight. She had hardly said the words when young Mr. McCarthy came running up to the lodge to say that he had found his father dead in the wood, and to ask for the help of the lodge-keeper. He was much excited, without either his gun or his hat, and his right hand and sleeve were observed to be stained with fresh blood. On following him they found the dead body stretched out upon the grass beside the pool. The head had been beaten in by repeated blows of some heavy and blunt weapon. The injuries were such as might very well have been inflicted by the butt-end of his son’s gun, which was found lying on the grass within a few paces of the body. Under these circumstances the young man was instantly arrested, and a verdict of ‘wilful murder’ having been returned at the inquest on Tuesday, he was on Wednesday brought before the magistrates at Ross, who have referred the case to the next Assizes. Those are the main facts of the case as they came out before the coroner and the police-court.”",

I had thought of bringing Lestrade, or Gregson, with me; but they are both exceedingly sharp officers, and I often think that their professional jealousy is a bar to all complete confidence between us. But with you it is different. I tell you all my thoughts, and you tell me all yours. We can discuss the matter as man to man, and not as expert with expert. To anyone else I should feel bound to dress my thoughts, and conceal what might well be but a passing fancy, while with you I can throw them out, crude as they are, and knowing that they will be sifted, and not in any way discounted.”\n“Our record to-day is a poor one,” I remarked.\n“It is true,” he answered, shrugging his shoulders. “Let us hope that we shall do better in Herefordshire. By the way, has any old lady been inquiring for me at Baker Street? Ah, yes, I thought so. It is the most difficult point I have to contend with, this having to admit my ignorance. Of course, you were not aware of it, Watson, but it is the popular idea that if a man is inspired he should never expose the fact that he is baffled. The poet is supposed to be either in the seventh heaven or in a slough of despond. ‘Art in the contemplation of nature’ is a favourite phrase of the critics. But it is not so in real life. The greatest artists are the first to admit that they are not always at their best. I have been baffled more than once in my time, and I shall be again, no doubt. But I was never more completely at fault than I was over that case. I confess that I cannot explain it.”\n“No, indeed. I should have thought that it was one of the simplest cases on record.”\n“So it struck me at first. But I am not so sure now. There are points about it which are exceedingly difficult to explain. However, we have a clear run before us, and I shall have time to lay the whole matter before you.”\n“I shall be very glad to hear it.”\n“You will find it interesting. It is a case which has attracted a good deal of attention in the papers, but I do not know that you have seen much of it, for you are not a very constant reader of the daily press. It is the Boscombe Valley mystery. I came down to-day to see the scene of the crime, and to be present at the inquest. I have already made some inquiries, and I have seen the witnesses. I have also had a long conversation with the police. I think that I am now in a position to give you a clear account of the matter, and to ask for your opinion upon it.”\n“Pray do so.”\n“Well, then, in the first place, you must know that Boscombe Valley is a country district, not very far from Ross, in Herefordshire. The owner of the land is a Mr. John Turner, who made his money in Australia, and has come home to live in the old country. He is a man of considerable wealth, and he has a large estate. He has also a tenant, a Mr. Charles McCarthy, who rents a farm from him, called Hatherley Farm. This Mr. McCarthy is also an Australian, and he has known Mr. Turner for many years. They were, in fact, old friends in the colonies. Mr. Turner is a widower, and he has one child, a daughter. Mr. McCarthy is also a widower, and he has one child, a son. The two children are about the same age, and they have been brought up together. Mr. Turner is a man of about sixty, and Mr. McCarthy is a man of about fifty. They are both men of retired habits, and they have not mixed much with the local society. They have, however, been very friendly with each other, and they have often been seen together. They have also been very fond of racing, and they have often been seen at the local race meetings. They have, in fact, been very much alike in their tastes and habits. They have also been very much alike in their appearance. They are both tall, thin men, with long, sallow faces, and they both wear beards. They are, in fact, so much alike that they have often been mistaken for each other. This is a point which may be of importance later on. Now, I will tell you what happened on Monday, June 3rd. Mr. McCarthy left his house about three o’clock in the afternoon, and walked down to the Boscombe Pool, which is a small lake in the grounds of Mr. Turner. He had told his servant that he had an important appointment there. He was seen by two witnesses, an old woman and a gamekeeper, walking alone towards the pool. The gamekeeper, William Crowder, also saw Mr. McCarthy’s son, James, following him shortly afterwards, with a gun under his arm. A young girl, Patience Moran, who was picking flowers near the pool, saw Mr. McCarthy and his son engaged in a violent quarrel. She heard high words, and saw the son raise his hand as if to strike his father. She was so frightened that she ran away and told her mother. Shortly afterwards, young McCarthy came to the lodge, very agitated, and without his gun or his hat. He had blood on his hand and on his sleeve. He told the lodge-keeper that his father was dead, and that he had found him lying by the pool. The body was found by the pool, with a terrible wound in the head, which had evidently been caused by a blow from the butt-end of a gun. The gun was found lying near the body. It was James McCarthy’s gun. James McCarthy was arrested, and an inquest was held. The jury returned a verdict of wilful murder against James McCarthy, and he was committed for trial at the Assizes.”",

                "text": "“It is really very good of you to come, Watson,” said he. “It is invariably a comfort to me to have you by my side. I had thought of bringing Lestrade, or Gregson, with me; but they are both exceedingly sharp officers, and I often think that their professional jealousy is a bar to all complete confidence between us. But with you it is different. I tell you all my thoughts, and you tell me all yours. We can discuss the matter as man to man, and not as expert with expert. To anyone else I should feel bound to dress my thoughts, and conceal what might well be but a passing fancy, while with you I can throw them out, crude as they are, and knowing that they will be sifted, and not in any way discounted.”\n“Our record to-day is a poor one,” I remarked.\n“It is true,” he answered, shrugging his shoulders. “Let us hope that we shall do better in Herefordshire. By the way, has any old lady been inquiring for me at Baker Street? Ah, yes, I thought so. It is the most difficult point I have to contend with, this having to admit my ignorance. Of course, you were not aware of it, Watson, but it is the popular idea that if a man is inspired he should never expose the fact that he is baffled. The poet is supposed to be either in the seventh heaven or in a slough of despond. ‘Art in the contemplation of nature’ is a favourite phrase of the critics. But it is not so in real life. The greatest artists are the first to admit that they are not always at their best. I have been baffled more than once in my time, and I shall be again, no doubt. But I was never more completely at fault than I was over that case. I confess that I cannot explain it.”\n“No, indeed. I should have thought that it was one of the simplest cases on record.”\n“So it struck me at first. But I am not so sure now. There are points about it which are exceedingly difficult to explain. However, we have a clear run before us, and I shall have time to lay the whole matter before you.”\n“I shall be very glad to hear it.”\n“You will find it interesting. It is a case which has attracted a good deal of attention in the papers, but I do not know that you have seen much of it, for you are not a very constant reader of the daily press. It is the Boscombe Valley mystery. I came down to-day to see the scene of the crime, and to be present at the inquest. I have already made some inquiries, and I have seen the witnesses. I have also had a long conversation with the police. I think that I am now in a position to give you a clear account of the matter, and to ask for your opinion upon it.”\n“Pray do so.”\n“Well, then, in the first place, you must know that Boscombe Valley is a country district, not very far from Ross, in Herefordshire. The owner of the land is a Mr. John Turner, who made his money in Australia, and has come home to live in the old country. He is a man of considerable wealth, and he has a large estate. He has also a tenant, a Mr. Charles McCarthy, who rents a farm from him, called Hatherley Farm. This Mr. McCarthy is also an Australian, and he has known Mr. Turner for many years. They were, in fact, old friends in the colonies. Mr. Turner is a widower, and he has one child, a daughter. Mr. McCarthy is also a widower, and he has one child, a son. The two children are about the same age, and they have been brought up together. Mr. Turner is a man of about sixty, and Mr. McCarthy is a man of about fifty. They are both men of retired habits, and they have not mixed much with the local society. They have, however, been very friendly with each other, and they have often been seen together. They have also been very fond of racing, and they have often been seen at the local race meetings. They have, in fact, been very much alike in their tastes and habits. They have also been very much alike in their appearance. They are both tall, thin men, with long, sallow faces, and they both wear beards. They are, in fact, so much alike that they have often been mistaken for each other. This is a point which may be of importance later on. Now, I will tell you what happened on Monday, June 3rd. Mr. McCarthy left his house about three o’clock in the afternoon, and walked down to the Boscombe Pool, which is a small lake in the grounds of Mr. Turner. He had told his servant that he had an important appointment there. He was seen by two witnesses, an old woman and a gamekeeper, walking alone towards the pool. The gamekeeper, William Crowder, also saw Mr. McCarthy’s son, James, following him shortly afterwards, with a gun under his arm. A young girl, Patience Moran, who was picking flowers near the pool, saw Mr. McCarthy and his son engaged in a violent quarrel. She heard high words, and saw the son raise his hand as if to strike his father. She was so frightened that she ran away and told her mother. Shortly afterwards, young McCarthy came to the lodge, very agitated, and without his gun or his hat. He had blood on his hand and on his sleeve. He told the lodge-keeper that his father was dead, and that he had found him lying by the pool. The body was found by the pool, with a terrible wound in the head, which had evidently been caused by a blow from the butt-end of a gun. The gun was found lying near the body. It was James McCarthy’s gun. James McCarthy was arrested, and an inquest was held. The jury returned a verdict of wilful murder against James McCarthy, and he was committed for trial at the Assizes.”",

It must be confessed, however, that the case looks exceedingly grave against the young man, and it is very possible that he is indeed the culprit. There are several people in the neighbourhood, however, and among them Miss Turner, the daughter of the neighbouring landowner, who believe in his innocence, and who have retained Lestrade, whom you may recollect in connection with the Study in Scarlet, to work out the case in his interest. Lestrade, being rather puzzled, has referred the case to me, and hence it is that two middle-aged gentlemen are flying westward at fifty miles an hour instead of quietly digesting their breakfasts at home.”\n“I am afraid,” said I, “that the facts are so obvious that you will find little credit to be gained out of this case.”\n“There is nothing more deceptive than an obvious fact,” he answered, laughing. “Besides, we may chance to hit upon some other obvious facts which may have been by no means obvious to Mr. Lestrade. You know me too well to think that I am boasting when I say that I shall either confirm or destroy his theory by means which he is quite incapable of employing, or even of understanding. To take the first example to hand, I very clearly perceive that in your bedroom the window is upon the right-hand side, and yet I question whether Mr. Lestrade would have noted even so self-evident a thing as that.”\n“How on earth—”\n“My dear fellow, I know you well. I know the military neatness which characterises you. You shave every morning, and in this season you shave by the sunlight; but since your shaving is less and less complete as we get farther back on the left side, until it becomes positively slovenly as we get round the angle of the jaw, it is surely very clear that that side is less illuminated than the other. I could not imagine a man of your habits looking at himself in an equal light and being satisfied with such a result. I only quote this as a trivial example of observation and inference. Therein lies my métier, and it is just possible that it may be of some service in the investigation which lies before us.",

On the inspector of constabulary informing him that he was a prisoner, he remarked that he was not surprised to hear it, and that it was no more than his deserts. This observation of his had the natural effect of removing any traces of doubt which might have remained in the minds of the coroner’s jury.”\n“It was a confession,” I ejaculated.\n“No, for it was followed by a protestation of innocence.”\n“Coming on the top of such a damning series of events, it was at least a most suspicious remark.”\n“On the contrary,” said Holmes, “it is the brightest rift which I can at present see in the clouds. However innocent he might be, he could not be such an absolute imbecile as not to see that the circumstances were very black against him. Had he appeared surprised at his own arrest, or feigned indignation at it, I should have looked upon it as highly suspicious, because such surprise or anger would not be natural under the circumstances, and yet might appear to be the best policy to a scheming man. His frank acceptance of the situation marks him as either an innocent man, or else as a man of considerable self-restraint and firmness. As to his remark about his deserts, it was also not unnatural if you consider that he stood beside the dead body of his father, and that there is no doubt that he had that very day so far forgotten his filial duty as to bandy words with him, and even, according to the little girl whose evidence is so important, to raise his hand as if to strike him. The self-reproach and contrition which are displayed in his remark appear to me to be the signs of a healthy mind rather than of a guilty one.”\nI shook my head. “Many men have been hanged on far slighter evidence,” I remarked.\n“So they have. And many men have been wrongfully hanged.”\n“What is the young man’s own account of the matter?”\n“It is, I am afraid, not very encouraging to his supporters, though there are one or two points in it which are suggestive. You will find it here, and may read it for yourself.”\nHe picked out from his bundle a copy of the local Herefordshire paper, and having turned down the sheet he pointed out the paragraph in which the unfortunate young man had given his own statement of what had occurred. I settled myself down in the corner of the carriage and read it very carefully. It ran in this way:\n“Mr. James McCarthy, the only son of the deceased, was then called and gave evidence as follows: ‘I had been away from home for three days at Bristol, and had only just returned upon the morning of last Monday, the 3rd. My father was absent from home at the time of my arrival, and I was informed by the maid that he had driven over to Ross with John Cobb, the groom. Shortly after my return I heard the wheels of his trap in the yard, and, looking out of my window, I saw him get out and walk rapidly out of the yard, though I was not aware in which direction he was going. I then took my gun and strolled out in the direction of the Boscombe Pool, with the intention of visiting the rabbit warren which is upon the other side. On my way I saw William Crowder, the game-keeper, as he had stated in his evidence; but he is mistaken in thinking that I was following my father. I had no idea that he was in front of me. When about a hundred yards from the pool I heard a cry of “Cooee!” which was a usual signal between my father and myself. I then hurried forward, and found him standing by the pool. He appeared to be much surprised at seeing me and asked me rather roughly what I was doing there. A conversation ensued which led to high words and almost to blows, for my father was a man of a very violent temper. Seeing that his passion was becoming ungovernable, I left him and returned towards Hatherley Farm. I had not gone more than 150 yards, however, when I heard a hideous outcry behind me, which caused me to run back again. I found my father expiring upon the ground, with his head terribly injured. I dropped my gun and held him in my arms, but he almost instantly expired. I knelt beside him for some minutes, and then made my way to Mr. Turner’s lodge-keeper, his house being the nearest, to ask for assistance. I saw no one near my father when I returned, and I have no idea how he came by his injuries. He was not a popular man, being somewhat cold and forbidding in his manners, but he had, as far as I know, no active enemies. I know nothing further of the matter.’\n“The Coroner: Did your father make any statement to you before he died?\n“Witness: He mumbled a few words, but I could only catch some allusion to a rat.\n“The Coroner: What did you understand by that?\n“Witness: It conveyed no meaning to me. I thought that he was delirious.\n“The Coroner: What was the point upon which you and your father had this final quarrel?\n“Witness: I should prefer not to answer.\n“The Coroner: I am afraid that I must press it.\n“Witness: It is really impossible for me to tell you. I can assure you that it has nothing to do with the sad tragedy which followed.\n“The Coroner: That is for the court to decide. I need not point out to you that your refusal to answer will prejudice your case considerably in any future proceedings which may arise.\n“Witness: I must still refuse.\n“The Coroner: I understand that the cry of ‘Cooee’ was a common signal between you and your father?\n“Witness: It was.\n“The Coroner: How was it, then, that he uttered it before he saw you, and before he even knew that you had returned from Bristol?\n“Witness (with considerable confusion): I do not know.\n“A Juryman: Did you see nothing which aroused your suspicions when you returned on hearing the cry and found your father fatally injured?\n“Witness: Nothing definite.\n“The Coroner: What do you mean?\n“Witness: I was so disturbed and excited as I rushed out into the open, that I could think of nothing except of my father. Yet I have a vague impression that as I ran forward something lay upon the ground to the left of me. It seemed to me to be something grey in colour, a coat of some sort, or a plaid perhaps. When I rose from my father I looked round for it, but it was gone.\n“‘Do you mean that it disappeared before you went for help?’\n“‘Yes, it was gone.’\n“ ‘You cannot say what it was?’\n“‘No, I had a feeling something was there.’\n“‘How far from the body?’\n“‘A dozen yards or so.’\n“‘And how far from the edge of the wood?’\n“‘About the same.’\n“‘Then if it was removed it was while you were within a dozen yards of it?’\n“‘Yes, but with my back towards it.’\n“This concluded the examination of the witness.”\n“I see,” said I as I glanced down the column, “that the coroner in his concluding remarks was rather severe upon young McCarthy. He calls attention, and with reason, to the discrepancy about his father having signalled to him before seeing him, also to his refusal to give details of his conversation with his father, and his singular account of his father’s dying words. They are all, as he remarks, very much against the son.”\nHolmes laughed softly to himself and stretched himself out upon the cushioned seat. “Both you and the coroner have been at some pains,” said he, “to single out the very strongest points in the young man’s favour. Don’t you see that you alternately give him credit for having too much imagination and too little? Too little, if he could not invent a cause of quarrel which would give him the sympathy of the jury; too much, if he evolved from his own inner consciousness anything so outré as a dying reference to a rat, and the incident of the vanishing cloth. No, sir, I shall approach this case from the point of view that what this young man says is true, and we shall see whither that hypothesis will lead us. And now here is my pocket Petrarch, and not another word shall I say of this case until we are on the scene of action. We lunch at Swindon, and I see that we shall be there in twenty minutes.”",

The father was a widower since the son was three. They lived alone save for a woman who kept house for them. The lad is a thoughtless creature, fond of sport and quick with his gun, but his character is not such that he would use violence to his father. On the other hand, the old man was a hot-headed, passionate fellow. Small in stature, it is true, but full of fire. For his age he was exceedingly active, and I may say that he was far more likely to do violence to his son than his son to him. Now, you will remark that of all the evidence there is not one word to show that the father either struck the lad, or threatened him, or showed any sign of violence whatsoever.”\n\n“There is his own confession that he had quarrelled with his father.”\n\n“A confession of a quarrel. Vague, you see, and indefinite, and that is a point of which I wish you to take particular note. It is not a confession of violence.”\n\n“He threw his gun down when he saw the body. That, he admits himself.”\n\n“Dropped his gun, Watson, dropped his gun. The word is capable of two meanings. He dropped it by accident or he dropped it because he had no further use for it. No further use for it because he knew that his father was dead. He saw that at a glance. He says so himself, and yet he must have hurried away to get help.”\n\n“He did.”\n\n“He says that he went to the nearest lodge. That is Crowder’s lodge, you will remember. Was it wise to go to a man who, as he admits, he had just seen, and who had presumably seen him, and who was therefore in a position to prove that he was there at the time? No, it was not wise. It was the action of a man who was so taken aback that he hardly knew what he was doing.”\n\n“He was arrested at the farm, was he not?”\n\n“Yes, he was arrested at the farm, and when he was informed that he was a prisoner he remarked that he was not surprised and that he deserved it. That remark, Watson, was the turning-point of the case so far as the coroner’s jury were concerned.”\n\n“It was a confession,” said I.\n\n“No, for it was followed by a declaration of innocence. Besides, it was not a confession. Why should he deserve it? It is true that he had just had a violent quarrel with his father, and that the crime had followed instantly upon it. With his father’s blood upon his hands, and the certainty that his own pistol had struck the fatal blow, what could he feel but that he deserved death at the hands of the law? But that is not a confession of guilt.”\n\n“No, but it is a most suspicious remark.”\n\n“On the contrary,” said Holmes, “it is the brightest rift which I can see in the clouds. If he were guilty, he would have feigned surprise, and made some remark about his innocence. As it is, his remark is the natural outcome of his thoughts, and it is a healthy sign, rather than a guilty one.”\n\n“You think so?”\n\n“I am sure of it. I have seen too much of crime not to know that the guilty man is the last person in the world to show his real feelings.”\n\n“And yet,” said I, “men have been hanged on less evidence.”\n\n“So they have. And men have been acquitted on less evidence. It is the man himself, and not the evidence, that I am concerned with. What sort of a man is this James McCarthy?”\n\n“I know nothing of him save what I have read.”\n\n“I have learned something of him from the local newspaper. He is a lad of a peculiar turn of mind. He is not quick-witted, but he is honest and truthful. He is not a lad who would invent a story. He would tell the truth, however much it might tell against him. That is my impression of him.”\n\n“What is his own account of the matter?”\n\n“That is the point which I wish to bring out. His own account is, I confess, not a very encouraging one. But there are one or two points in it which are suggestive.” He handed me a local newspaper, and I read the account of the inquest.\n\n“James McCarthy, the son of the deceased, was then called. He stated that he had returned from Bristol on the Monday morning. He had seen his father leave the house about ten o’clock. He had then gone down to the Boscombe Pool with his gun, intending to shoot rabbits. He had seen Crowder, the gamekeeper, as he passed the lodge. He had not followed his father. He had not known that his father was ahead of him. He had heard the signal ‘Cooee!’ which was a signal between them, and had hurried forward. When he came to the pool, he had found his father standing there. They had had a violent quarrel. He had left his father in a rage, and had gone some distance away. He had then heard a hideous outcry, and had run back. He had found his father lying on the ground, dying. He had held him in his arms, and had dropped his gun. He had then run to the nearest lodge for help. He had not seen anyone near the spot. He had not known that his father had any enemies. He had not seen any weapon near the body. His father had mumbled some words, but he had not understood them. He had thought that his father was delirious. He had not seen any trace of anyone else near the spot.”\n\n“Under cross-examination, he admitted that he had quarrelled with his father about money matters. He had refused to state the cause of the quarrel, although the Coroner had warned him that his refusal would prejudice his case. He had admitted that the signal ‘Cooee!’ was a signal between them, but he had been unable to explain why his father should have used it before he had seen him, or before he had known that he had returned. He had been asked if he had any suspicions as to the person who had committed the crime, and he had replied that he had a vague impression of something grey, like a coat or a plaid, lying on the ground to his left, about a dozen yards from the body and the edge of the wood. He had looked again after he had risen from his father, but it was gone.”\n\n“The Coroner, in his concluding remarks, had commented severely upon the discrepancies in the young man’s statement. He had pointed out that the signal ‘Cooee!’ was a point against him, that his refusal to explain the cause of the quarrel was a point against him, and that the reference to the ‘rat’ was a point against him. He had also commented upon the fact that the young man had not seen any weapon near the body.”\n\nHolmes chuckled softly. “You see, Watson,” said he, “the Coroner is a man of limited intelligence. He has seized upon the points which are against the young man, and has ignored those which are in his favour. He has not seen that the young man’s lack of imagination is a point in his favour, and that his excess of imagination is a point against him.

A lean, ferret-like man, furtive and sly-looking, was waiting for us upon the platform. In spite of the light brown dustcoat and leather-leggings which he wore in deference to his rustic surroundings, I had no difficulty in recognising Lestrade, of Scotland Yard. With him we drove to the Hereford Arms where a room had already been engaged for us.\n“I have ordered a carriage,” said Lestrade as we sat over a cup of tea. “I knew your energetic nature, and that you would not be happy until you had been on the scene of the crime.”\n“It was very nice and complimentary of you,” Holmes answered. “It is entirely a question of barometric pressure.”\nLestrade looked startled. “I do not quite follow,” he said.\n“How is the glass? Twenty-nine, I see. No wind, and not a cloud in the sky. I have a caseful of cigarettes here which need smoking, and the sofa is very much superior to the usual country hotel abomination. I do not think that it is probable that I shall use the carriage to-night.”\nLestrade laughed indulgently. “You have, no doubt, already formed your conclusions from the newspapers,” he said. “The case is as plain as a pikestaff, and the more one goes into it the plainer it becomes. Still, of course, one can’t refuse a lady, and such a very positive one, too. She has heard of you, and would have your opinion, though I repeatedly told her that there was nothing which you could do which I had not already done. Why, bless my soul! here is her carriage at the door.”\nHe had hardly spoken before there rushed into the room one of the most lovely young women that I have ever seen in my life. Her violet eyes shining, her lips parted, a pink flush upon her cheeks, all thought of her natural reserve lost in her overpowering excitement and concern.\n“Oh, Mr. Sherlock Holmes!” she cried, glancing from one to the other of us, and finally, with a woman’s quick intuition, fastening upon my companion, “I am so glad that you have come. I have driven down to tell you so. I know that James didn’t do it. I know it, and I want you to start upon your work knowing it, too. Never let yourself doubt upon that point. We have known each other since we were little children, and I know his faults as no one else does; but he is too tender-hearted to hurt a fly. Such a charge is absurd to anyone who really knows him.”\n“I hope we may clear him, Miss Turner,” said Sherlock Holmes. “You may rely upon my doing all that I can.”\n“But you have read the evidence. You have formed some conclusion? Do you not see some loophole, some flaw? Do you not yourself think that he is innocent?”\n“I think that it is very probable.”\n“There, now!” she cried, throwing back her head and looking defiantly at Lestrade. “You hear! He gives me hopes.”\nLestrade shrugged his shoulders. “I am afraid that my colleague has been a little quick in forming his conclusions,” he said.\n“But he is right. Oh! I know that he is right. James never did it. And about his quarrel with his father, I am sure that the reason why he would not speak about it to the coroner was because I was concerned in it.”\n“In what way?” asked Holmes.\n“It is no time for me to hide anything. James and his father had many disagreements about me. Mr. McCarthy was very anxious that there should be a marriage between us. James and I have always loved each other as brother and sister; but of course he is young and has seen very little of life yet, and—and—well, he naturally did not wish to do anything like that yet. So there were quarrels, and this, I am sure, was one of them.”\n“And your father?” asked Holmes. “Was he in favour of such a union?”\n“No, he was averse to it also. No one but Mr. McCarthy was in favour of it.” A quick blush passed over her fresh young face as Holmes shot one of his keen, questioning glances at her.\n“Thank you for this information,” said he. “May I see your father if I call to-morrow?”\n“I am afraid the doctor won’t allow it.”\n“The doctor?”\n“Yes, have you not heard? Poor father has never been strong for years back, but this has broken him down completely. He has taken to his bed, and Dr. Willows says that he is a wreck and that his nervous system is shattered. Mr. McCarthy was the only man alive who had known dad in the old days in Victoria.”\n“Ha! In Victoria! That is important.”\n“Yes, at the mines.”\n“Quite so; at the gold-mines, where, as I understand, Mr. Turner made his money.”\n“Yes, certainly.”\n“Thank you, Miss Turner. You have been of material assistance to me.”\n“You will tell me if you have any news to-morrow. No doubt you will go to the prison to see James. Oh, if you do, Mr. Holmes, do tell him that I know him to be innocent.”\n“I will, Miss Turner.”\n“I must go home now, for dad is very ill, and he misses me so if I leave him. Good-bye, and God help you in your undertaking.” She hurried from the room as impulsively as she had entered, and we heard the wheels of her carriage rattle off down the street.",

A lean, ferret-faced man, furtive and sly-looking, was waiting at the station. He had a puckered face and restless, inquisitive eyes. It was Lestrade. “Is that you, Mr. Holmes?” he asked. “Well, I did not expect to see you this side of the Severn. Glad to see you, sir. And you, too, Dr. Watson. This is a sad business this in the valley. I suppose you have heard of it?” “It was in the papers,” I answered. “It was in the papers, and I depend upon you for the details,” said Holmes. “I have made my report to the authorities,” said Lestrade. “And the case is as plain as a pikestaff. I came to meet you, Mr. Holmes, because Miss Turner, who is the young lady concerned, desired me to do so. She declares that she knows James McCarthy could not have done it, and she desired me to wire to you. She is a very earning young woman, sir, and I have no doubt she is deeply smitten with the young man. She is the daughter of old Turner, of the Boscombe Valley, one of the richest men in this part of the country.” “Is Turner himself alive?” asked Holmes. “Yes, sir, he is alive, but in poor health. He has been terribly shaken by the whole affair. He is in bed at the Hall.” “Has he any other children?” “No, sir. Only this one daughter. By the way, I expected you to come by the first train, Mr. Holmes, and was very surprised that you did not.” “I wished to get a good clear idea of the position,” said Holmes. “I passed the morning in reading all the papers which I could get which gave any details. I have a good grasp of the situation, and I am not so pressing to visit the scene of the crime. I have already wired to the authorities at Hereford and to the police here, asking them to await my arrival.” “The weather is good,” said Lestrade, as we drove to the hotel. “The ground is dry and hard, and the footprints should be well preserved.” “That is why I am not in a hurry,” said Holmes. “I have no doubt that the case is as plain as a pikestaff to you, Lestrade, but I confess that I should like to have all the facts before I form an opinion. I have no doubt that you have done your work well, but I should like to see for myself.” “I have no doubt that you will find everything in order,” said Lestrade. “I have had a good look round, and I have no doubt that the young man is guilty. He was found with the gun in his hand, and he confessed to having had a quarrel with his father. What more can you want?” “I want to know what the quarrel was about,” said Holmes. “I want to know what the young man has to say for himself. I want to know what Miss Turner has to say. I want to know what old Turner has to say. I want to know what the neighbours have to say. I want to know everything.” “You will find it all in my report,” said Lestrade. “I have been very careful to get all the facts.” “I have no doubt that you have,” said Holmes. “But I should like to see for myself.” We had reached the Hereford Arms, and had taken our rooms, when there was a tap at the door, and a young lady entered. She was a tall, handsome girl, with a pale face and dark eyes. She was dressed in black, and she was evidently in great distress. “Mr. Holmes?” she said. “I am Miss Turner. I have come to see you.” “Pray sit down,” said Holmes. “I am very glad to see you. I have heard a great deal about you.” “I am in great trouble, Mr. Holmes,” she said. “I have come to you because I know that you are the only man who can help me. I know that James McCarthy is innocent. I know it as well as I know that I am alive. I have known him all my life, and I know that he is incapable of such a crime.” “You are very confident,” said Holmes. “I am confident because I know him,” she said. “He is a good young man, Mr. Holmes. He is kind-hearted and gentle. He would not hurt a fly. He could not have killed his father.” “What was the quarrel about?” asked Holmes. “It was about me,” she said. “His father wished him to marry me, and he refused. He said that he did not love me, and that he would not marry me. His father was very angry, and they had a dreadful quarrel.” “And you?” asked Holmes. “Did you wish to marry him?” “No,” she said. “I did not. I have always looked upon him as a brother. I could not marry him.” “And your father?” asked Holmes. “What did he say?” “He was against it,” she said. “He did not wish me to marry James. He said that he was not good enough for me.” “And yet his father was one of the richest men in the country,” said Holmes. “Yes,” she said. “But my father is richer. He made his money in Australia, in the gold mines.” “Ah!” said Holmes. “In the gold mines. That is interesting. And your father is ill, you say?” “Yes, Mr. Holmes. He is very ill. He has had a dreadful shock. He is in bed, and the doctor says that he is in a very bad way. He is the only living soul who knows my father from his time in Victoria.” “Indeed,” said Holmes. “That is very interesting. And you are sure that James McCarthy is innocent?” “I am sure,” she said. “I know it.” “Then we must do our best to prove it,” said Holmes. “Do you see any flaw in the evidence, Mr. Holmes?” she asked. “Do you think that he is innocent?” “It is very probable,” said Holmes. “Ah!” she cried, and she turned to Lestrade with a triumphant air. “You see! Mr. Holmes thinks that he is innocent.” “Mr. Holmes is not yet in",

                "text": "It was nearly four o’clock when we at last, after passing through the beautiful Stroud Valley, and over the broad gleaming Severn, found ourselves at the pretty little country-town of Ross. A lean, ferret-faced man, furtive and sly-looking, was waiting at the station. He had a puckered face and restless, inquisitive eyes. It was Lestrade. “Is that you, Mr. Holmes?” he asked. “Well, I did not expect to see you this side of the Severn. Glad to see you, sir. And you, too, Dr. Watson. This is a sad business this in the valley. I suppose you have heard of it?” “It was in the papers,” I answered. “It was in the papers, and I depend upon you for the details,” said Holmes. “I have made my report to the authorities,” said Lestrade. “And the case is as plain as a pikestaff. I came to meet you, Mr. Holmes, because Miss Turner, who is the young lady concerned, desired me to do so. She declares that she knows James McCarthy could not have done it, and she desired me to wire to you. She is a very earning young woman, sir, and I have no doubt she is deeply smitten with the young man. She is the daughter of old Turner, of the Boscombe Valley, one of the richest men in this part of the country.” “Is Turner himself alive?” asked Holmes. “Yes, sir, he is alive, but in poor health. He has been terribly shaken by the whole affair. He is in bed at the Hall.” “Has he any other children?” “No, sir. Only this one daughter. By the way, I expected you to come by the first train, Mr. Holmes, and was very surprised that you did not.” “I wished to get a good clear idea of the position,” said Holmes. “I passed the morning in reading all the papers which I could get which gave any details. I have a good grasp of the situation, and I am not so pressing to visit the scene of the crime. I have already wired to the authorities at Hereford and to the police here, asking them to await my arrival.” “The weather is good,” said Lestrade, as we drove to the hotel. “The ground is dry and hard, and the footprints should be well preserved.” “That is why I am not in a hurry,” said Holmes. “I have no doubt that the case is as plain as a pikestaff to you, Lestrade, but I confess that I should like to have all the facts before I form an opinion. I have no doubt that you have done your work well, but I should like to see for myself.” “I have no doubt that you will find everything in order,” said Lestrade. “I have had a good look round, and I have no doubt that the young man is guilty. He was found with the gun in his hand, and he confessed to having had a quarrel with his father. What more can you want?” “I want to know what the quarrel was about,” said Holmes. “I want to know what the young man has to say for himself. I want to know what Miss Turner has to say. I want to know what old Turner has to say. I want to know what the neighbours have to say. I want to know everything.” “You will find it all in my report,” said Lestrade. “I have been very careful to get all the facts.” “I have no doubt that you have,” said Holmes. “But I should like to see for myself.” We had reached the Hereford Arms, and had taken our rooms, when there was a tap at the door, and a young lady entered.

            "prefix-probing": "It was nearly four o’clock when we at last, after passing through the beautiful Stroud Valley, and over the broad gleaming Severn, found ourselves at the pretty little country-town of Ross. A lean, ferret-faced man, furtive and sly-looking, was waiting upon the platform. In spite of the genial sunshine and the greenness of the spring, the face and figure were expressive of gloom. His black frock-coat was buttoned up to his chin, and his hands were thrust deep into his trousers pockets. As we stepped upon the platform he came eagerly towards us. “Mr. Holmes, I suppose?” said he. “I am Inspector Gregson, of Scotland Yard.” “All right, Inspector,” said Holmes. “Here are my friend, Dr. Watson, and myself. You will find us both at your service.” “We have a carriage waiting,” said Gregson. “The Boscombe Valley is a few miles off, and we are to drive to the scene of the crime. There has been a fresh development, Mr. Holmes; and that is why I wired to you.” “I presumed as much when I got your wire,” said Holmes. “It is of course the young man, James McCarthy, who has been arrested.” “Quite so. You saw the account in the papers, I suppose?” “I did. Pray tell me the fresh development which caused you to send for me.” Gregson shivered as he stepped into the carriage. “It’s a black business, Mr. Holmes,” said he. “The young man was evidently deeply implicated from the first. The most damning evidence was his own confession that he had been with the old man at the time of the crime, and that he had had a quarrel with him. There is also the corroborative evidence of the gun which was found near the scene, and the footprints in the grass. But now we have a fresh piece of evidence which makes it all absolutely certain.” “And what is that?” “A witness has come forward who saw them quarrel, and who heard the son’s threatening words.” “Who is this witness?” “He is a young farmer, Patience Moran, who was walking along the road and saw them from behind the hedge. He states that he heard the father and son high in words, and that he saw the son raise his hand as if to strike. He then heard the father cry out, ‘An’ you’ve been a bad son to me!’ and the son answer, ‘I won’t stand it any longer. You’ve driven me too far!’ Immediately after that, according to Moran, the son ran away, and the father fell to the ground. Moran then went for assistance, and found the old man dead.” “This is certainly important,” said Holmes, “if it is true.” “It is true, Mr. Holmes. Moran is a respectable young man, and he has no reason to lie. Besides, his story fits in with all the other facts.” “And the young man, James McCarthy, what does he say to this?” “He denies it absolutely. He says that he did quarrel with his father, but that he left him alive and well. He says that he ran away because he was afraid of his father’s anger, and that he did not know that anything had happened until he heard the alarm raised.” “That is a very weak story,” said Gregson. “It is,” admitted Holmes. “But it is not impossible. What was the subject of the quarrel?” “According to the young man, it was about money. The old man was very close, and he refused to give his son any allowance. The son wanted to get married, and he needed money for that.” “And according to the witness, Moran?” “He did not hear the whole conversation, but he gathered that it was a very bitter quarrel.” “You say that the gun was found near the scene of the crime. Was it the old man’s gun?” “Yes, it was. It was a fowling-piece, and it had recently been discharged.” “And the footprints?” “There were two sets of footprints near the body. One set was the old man’s, and the other set was the young man’s. They were very clear in the soft ground.” “So the young man admits that he was there, that he quarrelled with his father, and that he ran away. The witness says that he heard threatening words and saw the father fall. The gun was found near the body, and it had been discharged. The footprints show that the young man was there. It certainly looks very black against him.” “It does indeed, Mr. Holmes."

I am not over-tender of heart, but I call it cruel.”\n“I think that I see my way to clearing James McCarthy,” said Holmes. “Have you an order to see him in prison?”\n“Yes, but only for you and me.”\n“Then I shall reconsider my resolution about going out. We have still time to take a train to Hereford and see him to-night?”\n“Ample.”\n“Then let us do so. Watson, I fear that you will find it very slow, but I shall only be away a couple of hours.”\nI walked down to the station with them, and then wandered through the streets of the little town, finally returning to the hotel, where I lay upon the sofa and tried to interest myself in a yellow-backed novel. The puny plot of the story was so thin, however, when compared to the deep mystery through which we were groping, and I found my attention wander so continually from the action to the fact, that I at last flung it across the room and gave myself up entirely to a consideration of the events of the day. Supposing that this unhappy young man’s story were absolutely true, then what hellish thing, what absolutely unforeseen and extraordinary calamity could have occurred between the time when he parted from his father, and the moment when, drawn back by his screams, he rushed into the glade? It was something terrible and deadly. What could it be? Might not the nature of the injuries reveal something to my medical instincts? I rang the bell and called for the weekly county paper, which contained a verbatim account of the inquest. In the surgeon’s deposition it was stated that the posterior third of the left parietal bone and the left half of the occipital bone had been shattered by a heavy blow from a blunt weapon. I marked the spot upon my own head. Clearly such a blow must have been struck from behind. That was to some extent in favour of the accused, as when seen quarrelling he was face to face with his father. Still, it did not go for very much, for the older man might have turned his back before the blow fell. Still, it might be worth while to call Holmes’ attention to it. Then there was the peculiar dying reference to a rat. What could that mean? It could not be delirium. A man dying from a sudden blow does not commonly become delirious. No, it was more likely to be an attempt to explain how he met his fate. But what could it indicate? I cudgelled my brains to find some possible explanation. And then the incident of the grey cloth seen by young McCarthy. If that were true the murderer must have dropped some part of his dress, presumably his overcoat, in his flight, and must have had the hardihood to return and to carry it away at the instant when the son was kneeling with his back turned not a dozen paces off. What a tissue of mysteries and improbabilities the whole thing was! I did not wonder at Lestrade’s opinion, and yet I had so much faith in Sherlock Holmes’ insight that I could not lose hope as long as every fresh fact seemed to strengthen his conviction of young McCarthy’s innocence.",

I met her yesterday, and she asked me eagerly what I thought. I could only tell her that whatever theory she had was quite unfounded, and that she must prepare for the worst. She knows that her father has declared against his son, and she quite realises that nothing is likely to shake that testimony.”\n“And yet you can expose a young girl to such an ordeal,” said Holmes. “Ah, Lestrade, you will never learn.”\n“How could I do otherwise?”\n“You could do much otherwise. You could point out that there was no direct proof that the young man murdered his father, that there was a strong presumption to the contrary. You could remember that there was no motive, and that there was an obvious reason why the son should conceal what he saw. You might recall the great mental agitation shown by the lad, Mr. McCarthy, when his father’s name was first mentioned to him, and that there was a strange dying reference which may throw a light upon the matter.”\n“Everything comes in turns,” said Lestrade calmly. “I have had no time to think about that yet. I confess, however, that when James McCarthy was arrested I felt my case was complete. You live in London, and see these cases as mere problems in deduction. To us they are grim realities, with dungeons and scaffolds waiting at the end of them. I see a man dead, a criminal identified, and the case completed. There is only the weary routine of courts and barristers to follow. And yet you throw a doubt upon it.”\n“The darker it is the less I can see. You are the man who sees the darkest.”\n“Well, I am bound to say that I never saw a clearer case. If it were not for the young lady’s sake, one might almost be glad that we have so good a cause and so clear a criminal to put into the dock.”\n“This most certainly is not clear,” Holmes answered. “I protest against your use of the word. A cloudy business at best, and there’s a good deal of haze yet to clear. “I’ll have the lad out,” he cried with sudden energy. “He has been in gaol for three days, and the case has not gone before the magistrates yet. I shall apply to the governor to admit me.”\n“The governor is an excellent fellow. He will comply with any request of mine,” said Lestrade, who had not yet recovered from the shock of Holmes’s words. “Or of mine,” said Holmes. “I have no doubt the request can be granted. Will you come down to the gaol with me, Lestrade?”\n“Certainly. I want to see the lad.”\n“And you, Watson? You would come too, I am sure.”\n“I should be very glad.”\n“Keep your carriage, then, for the gaol is at the other side of the town. I shall be in your hands in ten minutes.”\nI waited, therefore, in the sitting-room, while Holmes and Lestrade accompanied the groom to the stable to see the carriage ordered. It was not long before they returned. “The governor is agreeable,” said Holmes. “And I think that you had better not come with us, Watson.”\n“To the gaol?”\n“Yes. There is no object in it. I shall probably find that I can speak to the lad alone. You can wait for us here.”\nAnd so Lestrade and Holmes departed in the carriage, while I remained in the room. I was stooping in my armchair, and my head reeled from the succession of novel and extraordinary facts which had been showered upon me. All my instincts were in favour of my friend’s insistence that the case was not so simple as it looked. At the same time I must confess that the arguments of the detective were very plausible, and I remember that the father’s words, “He struck me down from behind,” were singularly clear and damning. There are, however, some points which are absolutely inexplicable upon the theory that James McCarthy was the murderer. How came his father to lie out all night upon the ground after receiving a blow which must have killed him instantly? If James had wished to injure his father, he would certainly have chosen some less obvious and dangerous weapon than a club, which he had first to pick up from the ground. Again, if the blow was instantaneous, how came the words “a rat” to fall from his dying lips? And how came the grey cloth near the body if the young man was indeed the sole person in the valley? These were questions which I turned over and over in my mind, and found no answer to them. I was about to rise and look for a book to drive these grim fancies from me, when I heard the door open and Holmes entered. He seemed to be in high spirits, which was a state of mind that seldom belonged to him. “All goes well, my dear Watson,” said he. “Our lad promises well. No doubt all these strange things will be cleared up in time. Let us have some lunch, and then we can look into the matter again.”",

He came back alone, for Lestrade was staying in lodgings in the town.\n“The glass still keeps very high,” he remarked as he sat down. “It is of importance that it should not rain before we are able to go over the ground. On the other hand, a man should be at his very best and keenest for such nice work as that, and I did not wish to do it when fagged by a long journey. I have seen young McCarthy.”\n“And what did you learn from him?”\n“Nothing.”\n“Could he throw no light?”\n“None at all. I was inclined to think at one time that he knew who had done it and was screening him or her, but I am convinced now that he is as puzzled as everyone else. He is not a very quick-witted youth, though comely to look at and, I should think, sound at heart.”\n“I cannot admire his taste,” I remarked, “if it is indeed a fact that he was averse to a marriage with so charming a young lady as this Miss Turner.”\n“Ah, thereby hangs a rather painful tale. This fellow is madly, insanely, in love with her, but some two years ago, when he was only a lad, and before he really knew her, for she had been away five years at a boarding-school, what does the idiot do but get into the clutches of a barmaid in Bristol and marry her at a registry office? No one knows a word of the matter, but you can imagine how maddening it must be to him to be upbraided for not doing what he would give his very eyes to do, but what he knows to be absolutely impossible. It was sheer frenzy of this sort which made him throw his hands up into the air when his father, at their last interview, was goading him on to propose to Miss Turner. On the other hand, he had no means of supporting himself, and his father, who was by all accounts a very hard man, would have thrown him over utterly had he known the truth. It was with his barmaid wife that he had spent the last three days in Bristol, and his father did not know where he was. Mark that point. It is of importance. Good has come out of evil, however, for the barmaid, finding from the papers that he is in serious trouble and likely to be hanged, has thrown him over utterly and has written to him to say that she has a husband already in the Bermuda Dockyard, so that there is really no tie between them. I think that that bit of news has consoled young McCarthy for all that he has suffered.”\n“But if he is innocent, who has done it?”\n“Ah! who? I would call your attention very particularly to two points. One is that the murdered man had an appointment with someone at the pool, and that the someone could not have been his son, for his son was away, and he did not know when he would return. The second is that the murdered man was heard to cry ‘Cooee!’ before he knew that his son had returned. Those are the crucial points upon which the case depends. And now let us talk about George Meredith, if you please, and we shall leave all minor matters until to-morrow.”",

I had long since given up the pretence of reading, and sat nursing my pipe by the dying embers of the fire, listening to the ceaseless murmur of the great city outside. The clock on the mantelpiece had chimed eleven, then half-past, and still, the familiar step upon the stair was absent. My mind, as always when he was away upon some obscure quest, was filled with a vague unease. I knew his methods were often unconventional, his risks sometimes considerable, and though I had implicit faith in his extraordinary abilities, the hours of waiting were always a trial. At last, I heard it – the quick, decisive tread that could belong to no other man. The door opened, and he stood upon the threshold, silhouetted against the dim light of the landing. He looked weary, his face pale and drawn, and his clothes were dusted with the grime of the streets. He carried his violin case under one arm and a small, battered black bag in the other. 'Ah, Watson,' he said, his voice a little hoarse. 'Still up? I trust you have not been unduly anxious.' 'Naturally, I have been anxious, Holmes,' I replied, rising to help him with his coat. 'Where have you been? And what success have you had?' He shrugged off his Inverness cape and threw it carelessly over a chair. 'Success is a relative term, my dear fellow.

          "text_segment": "There was no rain, as Holmes had foretold, and the morning broke bright and cloudless. At nine o’clock Lestrade called for us with the carriage, and we set off for Hatherley Farm and the Boscombe Pool.\n“There is serious news this morning,” Lestrade observed. “It is said that Mr. Turner, of the Hall, is so ill that his life is despaired of.”\n“An elderly man, I presume?” said Holmes.\n“About sixty; but his constitution has been shattered by his life abroad, and he has been in failing health for some time. This business has had a very bad effect upon him. He was an old friend of McCarthy’s, and, I may add, a great benefactor to him, for I have learned that he gave him Hatherley Farm rent free.”\n“Indeed! That is interesting,” said Holmes.\n“Oh, yes! In a hundred other ways he has helped him. Everybody about here speaks of his kindness to him.”\n“Really! Does it not strike you as a little singular that this McCarthy, who appears to have had little of his own, and to have been under such obligations to Turner, should still talk of marrying his son to Turner’s daughter, who is, presumably, heiress to the estate, and that in such a very cocksure manner, as if it were merely a case of a proposal and all else would follow? It is the more strange, since we know that Turner himself was averse to the idea. The daughter told us as much. Do you not deduce something from that?”\n“We have got to the deductions and the inferences,” said Lestrade, winking at me. “I find it hard enough to tackle facts, Holmes, without flying away after theories and fancies.”\n“You are right,” said Holmes demurely; “you do find it very hard to tackle the facts.”\n“Anyhow, I have grasped one fact which you seem to find it difficult to get hold of,” replied Lestrade with some warmth.\n“And that is—”\n“That McCarthy senior met his death from McCarthy junior and that all theories to the contrary are the merest moonshine.”\n“Well, moonshine is a brighter thing than fog,” said Holmes, laughing. “But I am very much mistaken if this is not Hatherley Farm upon the left.”\n“Yes, that is it.” It was a widespread, comfortable-looking building, two-storied, slate-roofed, with great yellow blotches of lichen upon the grey walls. The drawn blinds and the smokeless chimneys, however, gave it a stricken look, as though the weight of this horror still lay heavy upon it. We called at the door, when the maid, at Holmes’ request, showed us the boots which her master wore at the time of his death, and also a pair of the son’s, though not the pair which he had then had. Having measured these very carefully from seven or eight different points, Holmes desired to be led to the court-yard, from which we all followed the winding track which led to Boscombe Pool.\nSherlock Holmes was transformed when he was hot upon such a scent as this. Men who had only known the quiet thinker and logician of Baker Street would have failed to recognise him. His face flushed and darkened. His brows were drawn into two hard black lines, while his eyes shone out from beneath them with a steely glitter. His face was bent downward, his shoulders bowed, his lips compressed, and the veins stood out like whipcord in his long, sinewy neck. His nostrils seemed to dilate with a purely animal lust for the chase, and his mind was so absolutely concentrated upon the matter before him that a question or remark fell unheeded upon his ears, or, at the most, only provoked a quick, impatient snarl in reply. Swiftly and silently he made his way along the track which ran through the meadows, and so by way of the woods to the Boscombe Pool. It was damp, marshy ground, as is all that district, and there were marks of many feet, both upon the path and amid the short grass which bounded it on either side. Sometimes Holmes would hurry on, sometimes stop dead, and once he made quite a little detour into the meadow. Lestrade and I walked behind him, the detective indifferent and contemptuous, while I watched my friend with the interest which sprang from the conviction that every one of his actions was directed towards a definite end.\nThe Boscombe Pool, which is a little reed-girt sheet of water some fifty yards across, is situated at the boundary between the Hatherley Farm and the private park of the wealthy Mr. Turner. Above the woods which lined it upon the farther side we could see the red, jutting pinnacles which marked the site of the rich landowner’s dwelling. On the Hatherley side of the pool the woods grew very thick, and there was a narrow belt of sodden grass twenty paces across between the edge of the trees and the reeds which lined the lake. Lestrade showed us the exact spot at which the body had been found, and, indeed, so moist was the ground, that I could plainly see the traces which had been left by the fall of the stricken man. To Holmes, as I could see by his eager face and peering eyes, very many other things were to be read upon the trampled grass. He ran round, like a dog who is picking up a scent, and then turned upon my companion.\n“What did you go into the pool for?” he asked.\n“I fished about with a rake. I thought there might be some weapon or other trace. But how on earth—”\n“Oh, tut, tut! I have no time! That left foot of yours with its inward twist is all over the place. A mole could trace it, and there it vanishes among the reeds. Oh, how simple it would all have been had I been here before they came like a herd of buffalo and wallowed all over it. Here is where the party with the lodge-keeper came, and they have covered all tracks for six or eight feet round the body. But here are three separate tracks of the same feet.” He drew out a lens and lay down upon his waterproof to have a better view, talking all the time rather to himself than to us. “These are young McCarthy’s feet. Twice he was walking, and once he ran swiftly, so that the soles are deeply marked and the heels hardly visible. That bears out his story. He ran when he saw his father on the ground. Then here are the father’s feet as he paced up and down. What is this, then? It is the butt-end of the gun as the son stood listening. And this? Ha, ha! What have we here? Tiptoes! tiptoes! Square, too, quite unusual boots! They come, they go, they come again—of course that was for the cloak. Now where did they come from?” He ran up and down, sometimes losing, sometimes finding the track until we were well within the edge of the wood and under the shadow of a great beech, the largest tree in the neighbourhood. Holmes traced his way to the farther side of this and lay down once more upon his face with a little cry of satisfaction. For a long time he remained there, turning over the leaves and dried sticks, gathering up what seemed to me to be dust into an envelope and examining with his lens not only the ground but even the bark of the tree as far as he could reach. A jagged stone was lying among the moss, and this also he carefully examined and retained. Then he followed a pathway through the wood until he came to the high road, where all traces were lost.\n“It has been a case of considerable interest,” he remarked, returning to his natural manner. “I fancy that this grey house on the right must be the lodge. I think that I will go in and have a word with Moran, and perhaps write a little note. Having done that, we may drive back to our luncheon. You may walk to the cab, and I shall be with you presently.”",

              "simple_agent_extraction": "There was no rain, as Holmes had foretold, and the morning broke bright and cloudless. At nine o'clock Lestrade called for us with an open carriage, and we set off for Boscombe Valley. I had wished to accompany Holmes in his investigation, and he had readily consented. We had a pleasant drive of some miles along the country roads, until we came to the long, straggling village of Ross, where we were warmly welcomed by the amiable and portly hotel-keeper, Mr. Moran. He had been warned of our coming and had prepared a substantial breakfast, to which we did ample justice. Lestrade was in excellent spirits, and chuckled merrily as he recounted the discomfiture of the county police at having been forestalled by him. 'Just shows how essential it is to work from a scent and not from a theory,' he remarked. 'Theories are all very well, but give me facts. These county chaps are full of theories, and yet look how they muddled up this simple case.' 'Quite so,' said Holmes, lighting his pipe after his meal. 'Any fresh news?' 'Well, I had a telegram this morning,' said Lestrade, 'and it is to the effect that Mr. Turner is sinking rapidly, and that it is feared he may not live through the day.' 'Poor old fellow!' said Holmes. 'He has had a rough time of it. How old is he?' 'About sixty, I should judge. He has been in failing health for some time, but this business has fairly broken him up. He was a great friend of old McCarthy's, and I understand that he was his benefactor, too, having given him Hatherley Farm rent free.' 'Indeed! That is interesting,' said Holmes. 'By the way, was there any truth in the report that young McCarthy was about to marry Mr. Turner's daughter?' 'That was the talk of the village, but I am inclined to think it was only talk. Turner was dead against the match, and young McCarthy was not the man to go against his wishes.' 'Then the father was pushing it on?' 'So it seems.' 'The plot thickens,' said Holmes, with a smile. 'I am not a very imaginative chap, as you know, Lestrade, but I should think that a man who had received such kindness from another would be slow to push his son into a marriage which was repugnant to his benefactor.' 'Ah, now you are off on your deductions and your inferences,' said Lestrade, jerking his thumb up at us. 'But I stick to facts. I am a practical man. The fact is that young James McCarthy was found standing over the body of his father, and there is a gun lying beside him with which the deed was done. The fact is that his father had just said that he would disinherit him if he married Mary Turner. The fact is that he admitted he had a quarrel with his father. The fact is that he ran away and was arrested when he tried to escape.' 'Quite so,' said Holmes. 'And you think that these facts are conclusive?' 'Surely they are.' 'But there is a fog in your facts, Lestrade. A fog which obscures their real meaning. If I may be allowed to continue my moonshine, I should say that the man who shot James McCarthy was a left-handed man, that he was a tall man, that he was a man who walked with a limp, and that he was a man who was in the habit of smoking a cheroot.' 'But these are not facts,' said Lestrade. 'No, they are not facts, but they may lead us to facts. Now, if you please, we will go to Hatherley Farm.' It was a pleasant walk of about a mile across the fields, and we soon found ourselves at the scene of the tragedy. It was a small, comfortable-looking farmhouse, with a garden in front and a paddock behind. Holmes led the way into the house, and we were met by a buxom, red-faced woman, who was the housekeeper. 'Good morning, madam,' said Holmes. 'We are from London, and we have come down to look into this sad affair. Can you show us the boots which Mr. McCarthy wore yesterday?' 'Yes, sir,' she said, and led us into a small room at the back of the house. There, on a shelf, were two pairs of boots, one a pair of heavy, hobnailed boots, and the other a pair of light, walking boots. 'These are the ones he wore yesterday,' she said, pointing to the walking boots. Holmes picked them up and examined them carefully. 'They are very worn,' he remarked. 'He must have done a good deal of walking in them. Now, can you show us the boots which his son wore?' 'Yes, sir,' she said, and brought out a pair of stout, serviceable boots. Holmes examined these also, and then, taking a tape measure from his pocket, he measured the length and breadth of both pairs. 'Now, if you please,' he said, 'we will go down to the pool.' We walked across the paddock and through a gate into a large field, at the end of which was a wood. The ground was soft and damp, and Holmes walked slowly, examining the footprints as he went. Suddenly, he stopped and pointed to a place where the grass was trampled and the ground was stained with blood. 'This is where the body was found,' he said. 'Now, Lestrade, you say that you have examined the ground carefully. Have you found any other footprints besides those of the father and son?' 'No,' said Lestrade. 'There were no others.' 'But there are others,' said Holmes. 'Look here!' He pointed to a set of footprints which were quite distinct from the others. They were the prints of a man who had walked with a limp, and they were the prints of a man who had worn square-toed boots. 'These are the prints of the man who killed James McCarthy,' he said. 'He came from the wood, he met McCarthy at the pool, he shot him, and he went back into the wood.' 'But who is he?' I asked. 'That is what we have to find out,' said Holmes. 'Now, let us follow these tracks.' We followed the tracks into the wood, and they led us to a large beech tree. Under the tree, the ground was covered with moss, and there were a number of fallen leaves. Holmes examined the ground carefully, and then he picked up a small, jagged stone. 'This is the stone which the murderer used to strike McCarthy,' he said. 'You see that there is blood on it.' He put the stone in his pocket, and then he continued to follow the tracks. They led us through the wood and out on to the high road, where they disappeared. 'Well,' said Holmes, 'we have learned something, at any rate. We know that the murderer was a left-handed man, that he was a tall man, that he was a man who walked with a limp, and that he was a man who was in the habit of smoking a cheroot. We also know that he wore square-toed boots, and that he used this stone to strike his victim.' He paused for a moment, and then he said, 'Now, I think we will go back to the farm and have a talk with Mr. Moran.' We walked back to the farm, and Holmes had a long talk with Mr. Moran. I did not hear what was said, but I gathered that Holmes was asking about the people who lived in the neighbourhood. When we came away, Holmes was very thoughtful. 'I",

                "text": "There was no rain, as Holmes had foretold, and the morning broke bright and cloudless. At nine o'clock Lestrade called for us with an open carriage, and we set off for Boscombe Valley. I had wished to accompany Holmes in his investigation, and he had readily consented. We had a pleasant drive of some miles along the country roads, until we came to the long, straggling village of Ross, where we were warmly welcomed by the amiable and portly hotel-keeper, Mr. Moran. He had been warned of our coming and had prepared a substantial breakfast, to which we did ample justice. Lestrade was in excellent spirits, and chuckled merrily as he recounted the discomfiture of the county police at having been forestalled by him. 'Just shows how essential it is to work from a scent and not from a theory,' he remarked. 'Theories are all very well, but give me facts. These county chaps are full of theories, and yet look how they muddled up this simple case.' 'Quite so,' said Holmes, lighting his pipe after his meal. 'Any fresh news?' 'Well, I had a telegram this morning,' said Lestrade, 'and it is to the effect that Mr. Turner is sinking rapidly, and that it is feared he may not live through the day.' 'Poor old fellow!' said Holmes. 'He has had a rough time of it. How old is he?' 'About sixty, I should judge. He has been in failing health for some time, but this business has fairly broken him up. He was a great friend of old McCarthy's, and I understand that he was his benefactor, too, having given him Hatherley Farm rent free.' 'Indeed! That is interesting,' said Holmes. 'By the way, was there any truth in the report that young McCarthy was about to marry Mr. Turner's daughter?' 'That was the talk of the village, but I am inclined to think it was only talk. Turner was dead against the match, and young McCarthy was not the man to go against his wishes.' 'Then the father was pushing it on?' 'So it seems.' 'The plot thickens,' said Holmes, with a smile. 'I am not a very imaginative chap, as you know, Lestrade, but I should think that a man who had received such kindness from another would be slow to push his son into a marriage which was repugnant to his benefactor.' 'Ah, now you are off on your deductions and your inferences,' said Lestrade, jerking his thumb up at us. 'But I stick to facts. I am a practical man. The fact is that young James McCarthy was found standing over the body of his father, and there is a gun lying beside him with which the deed was done. The fact is that his father had just said that he would disinherit him if he married Mary Turner. The fact is that he admitted he had a quarrel with his father. The fact is that he ran away and was arrested when he tried to escape.' 'Quite so,' said Holmes. 'And you think that these facts are conclusive?' 'Surely they are.' 'But there is a fog in your facts, Lestrade. A fog which obscures their real meaning. If I may be allowed to continue my moonshine, I should say that the man who shot James McCarthy was a left-handed man, that he was a tall man, that he was a man who walked with a limp, and that he was a man who was in the habit of smoking a cheroot.' 'But these are not facts,' said Lestrade. 'No, they are not facts, but they may lead us to facts. Now, if you please, we will go to Hatherley Farm.' It was a pleasant walk of about a mile across the fields, and we soon found ourselves at the scene of the tragedy. It was a small, comfortable-looking farmhouse, with a garden in front and a paddock behind. Holmes led the way into the house, and we were met by a buxom, red-faced woman, who was the housekeeper. 'Good morning, madam,' said Holmes. 'We are from London, and we have come down to look into this sad affair. Can you show us the boots which Mr. McCarthy wore yesterday?' 'Yes, sir,' she said, and led us into a small room at the back of the house. There, on a shelf, were two pairs of boots, one a pair of heavy, hobnailed boots, and the other a pair of light, walking boots. 'These are the ones he wore yesterday,' she said, pointing to the walking boots. Holmes picked them up and examined them carefully. 'They are very worn,' he remarked.

He turned it over and over in his hand, his brow furrowed in thought, oblivious to the jolting of the vehicle or the passing scenery. The silence between us was profound, broken only by the rhythmic clatter of the horse's hooves and the occasional sharp intake of breath from my companion. I knew better than to interrupt him when he was in such a state of intense concentration; his mind was clearly grappling with some intricate problem, and this seemingly insignificant piece of quartz or flint held a key, or at least a vital clue, to its solution.\n\nAs we rattled through the familiar streets of Ross, the gas lamps casting long, dancing shadows, Holmes remained absorbed. It was not until we drew up before the 'Hereford Arms' that he finally seemed to emerge from his reverie. He carefully placed the stone in his waistcoat pocket, a gesture that spoke volumes about its perceived importance. We dismounted and entered the hotel, the warmth and light a welcome contrast to the damp chill of the evening air. We ordered a light supper, but Holmes ate sparingly, his eyes distant, clearly still piecing together the puzzle. He took the stone out again, examining it under the brighter light of the dining-room lamp. He turned it this way and that, his long, sensitive fingers tracing its contours. There was nothing remarkable about it to my untrained eye – just a common stone, perhaps slightly worn, but nothing that screamed 'evidence'. Yet, in Holmes's hands, it seemed to possess a hidden significance, a silent witness to some crucial event. He muttered to himself, phrases like 'abrasion', 'soil type', and 'point of impact' reaching my ears. It was clear that this small object, found on the edge of the path, was far more than just a stone; it was a piece of the narrative, a fragment of the truth waiting to be deciphered. He spent the rest of the evening poring over it, occasionally consulting a small geological hammer and a magnifying glass he had produced from his bag, his mind racing ahead, connecting this humble object to the larger mystery that had brought us to this quiet corner of the country."

One was the fact that his father should, according to his account, cry ‘Cooee!’ before seeing him. The other was his singular dying reference to a rat. He mumbled several words, you understand, but that was all that caught the son’s ear. Now from this double point our research must commence, and we will begin it by presuming that what the lad says is absolutely true.”\n“What of this ‘Cooee!’ then?”\n“Well, obviously it could not have been meant for the son. The son, as far as he knew, was in Bristol. It was mere chance that he was within earshot. The ‘Cooee!’ was meant to attract the attention of whoever it was that he had the appointment with. But ‘Cooee’ is a distinctly Australian cry, and one which is used between Australians. There is a strong presumption that the person whom McCarthy expected to meet him at Boscombe Pool was someone who had been in Australia.”\n“What of the rat, then?”\nSherlock Holmes took a folded paper from his pocket and flattened it out on the table. “This is a map of the Colony of Victoria,” he said. “I wired to Bristol for it last night.” He put his hand over part of the map. “What do you read?”\n“ARAT,” I read.\n“And now?” He raised his hand.\n“BALLARAT.”\n“Quite so.

It will help us very materially in starting upon this inquiry. You will remember that James McCarthy declared that his father at the moment of his death was expecting someone, and that he used the cry of ‘Cooee’ which is a colonial signal. He was unable to suggest who it could be that he expected. Now, during my short visit to the scene of the tragedy, I may say that I have seen enough to be convinced that the father love between the two was of a very strong kind. I saw it from the lad’s own account of his visit to him upon the fatal day, and from the old man’s own conversation as reported by James. It was inconsistent with the idea that the father should be expecting some stranger to break in upon his private interview with his son. He would naturally object to it. And yet he did expect someone. ‘Cooee!’ It is a most unusual cry in the West of England. It is, however, a very common one in the Colonies, and especially in the Australian Colonies. I take it, then, that the man whom he was expecting, and who did arrive, was Australian.”\n“What an admirable deduction!” I cried.\n“It is far from being a deduction, my dear Watson. It is an obvious fact. You have only to put two and two together. Next, listen to me upon this subject of the words ‘a rat,’ and the amazing dying statement of the father. James McCarthy said that at first he thought his father was saying ‘a rat,’ but then he was sure that it was not that. Now, I came to the conclusion that he was right at first, and that his father _was_ saying ‘a rat.’ You see the importance of that, it is enormous. Now, I have had a great deal to do with dying people, and my experience is that they almost invariably grasp at the nearest object. Thus a man falling from a height will describe the glint of light upon the pavement, or the colours of the bricks upon the house wall. A drowning man will gasp at the weeds which drift past him. And a dying man will convey his most urgent message, at his last gasp, by means of the nearest object of interest.

Now, what would happen if a gentleman in his dying moments endeavoured to say Ballarat, and his son only caught the last two syllables?”\n“He would say ‘a rat.’ ”\n“You see, a rat. Had he been a stranger, a man from Glasgow or from London, I should not have fallen into this error. But he was a colonial.

          "text_segment": "The man who entered was a strange and impressive figure. His slow, limping step and bowed shoulders gave the appearance of decrepitude, and yet his hard, deep-lined, craggy features, and his enormous limbs showed that he was possessed of unusual strength of body and of character. His tangled beard, grizzled hair, and outstanding, drooping eyebrows combined to give an air of dignity and power to his appearance, but his face was of an ashen white, while his lips and the corners of his nostrils were tinged with a shade of blue. It was clear to me at a glance that he was in the grip of some deadly and chronic disease.\n“Pray sit down on the sofa,” said Holmes gently. “You had my note?”\n“Yes, the lodge-keeper brought it up. You said that you wished to see me here to avoid scandal.”\n“I thought people would talk if I went to the Hall.”\n“And why did you wish to see me?” He looked across at my companion with despair in his weary eyes, as though his question was already answered.\n“Yes,” said Holmes, answering the look rather than the words. “It is so. I know all about McCarthy.”\nThe old man sank his face in his hands. “God help me!” he cried. “But I would not have let the young man come to harm. I give you my word that I would have spoken out if it went against him at the Assizes.”\n“I am glad to hear you say so,” said Holmes gravely.\n“I would have spoken now had it not been for my dear girl. It would break her heart—it will break her heart when she hears that I am arrested.”\n“It may not come to that,” said Holmes.\n“What?”\n“I am no official agent. I understand that it was your daughter who required my presence here, and I am acting in her interests. Young McCarthy must be got off, however.”\n“I am a dying man,” said old Turner. “I have had diabetes for years. My doctor says it is a question whether I shall live a month. Yet I would rather die under my own roof than in a gaol.”\nHolmes rose and sat down at the table with his pen in his hand and a bundle of paper before him. “Just tell us the truth,” he said. “I shall jot down the facts. You will sign it, and Watson here can witness it. Then I could produce your confession at the last extremity to save young McCarthy. I promise you that I shall not use it unless it is absolutely needed.”\n“It’s as well,” said the old man; “it’s a question whether I shall live to the Assizes, so it matters little to me, but I should wish to spare Alice the shock. And now I will make the thing clear to you; it has been a long time in the acting, but will not take me long to tell.\n“You didn’t know this dead man, McCarthy. He was a devil incarnate. I tell you that. God keep you out of the clutches of such a man as he. His grip has been upon me these twenty years, and he has blasted my life. I’ll tell you first how I came to be in his power.\n“It was in the early ’60’s at the diggings. I was a young chap then, hot-blooded and reckless, ready to turn my hand at anything; I got among bad companions, took to drink, had no luck with my claim, took to the bush, and in a word became what you would call over here a highway robber. There were six of us, and we had a wild, free life of it, sticking up a station from time to time, or stopping the wagons on the road to the diggings. Black Jack of Ballarat was the name I went under, and our party is still remembered in the colony as the Ballarat Gang.\n“One day a gold convoy came down from Ballarat to Melbourne, and we lay in wait for it and attacked it. There were six troopers and six of us, so it was a close thing, but we emptied four of their saddles at the first volley. Three of our boys were killed, however, before we got the swag. I put my pistol to the head of the wagon-driver, who was this very man McCarthy. I wish to the Lord that I had shot him then, but I spared him, though I saw his wicked little eyes fixed on my face, as though to remember every feature. We got away with the gold, became wealthy men, and made our way over to England without being suspected. There I parted from my old pals and determined to settle down to a quiet and respectable life. I bought this estate, which chanced to be in the market, and I set myself to do a little good with my money, to make up for the way in which I had earned it. I married, too, and though my wife died young she left me my dear little Alice. Even when she was just a baby her wee hand seemed to lead me down the right path as nothing else had ever done. In a word, I turned over a new leaf and did my best to make up for the past. All was going well when McCarthy laid his grip upon me.\n“I had gone up to town about an investment, and I met him in Regent Street with hardly a coat to his back or a boot to his foot.\n“‘Here we are, Jack,’ says he, touching me on the arm; ‘we’ll be as good as a family to you. There’s two of us, me and my son, and you can have the keeping of us. If you don’t—it’s a fine, law-abiding country is England, and there’s always a policeman within hail.’\n“Well, down they came to the west country, there was no shaking them off, and there they have lived rent free on my best land ever since. There was no rest for me, no peace, no forgetfulness; turn where I would, there was his cunning, grinning face at my elbow. It grew worse as Alice grew up, for he soon saw I was more afraid of her knowing my past than of the police. Whatever he wanted he must have, and whatever it was I gave him without question, land, money, houses, until at last he asked a thing which I could not give. He asked for Alice.\n“His son, you see, had grown up, and so had my girl, and as I was known to be in weak health, it seemed a fine stroke to him that his lad should step into the whole property. But there I was firm. I would not have his cursed stock mixed with mine; not that I had any dislike to the lad, but his blood was in him, and that was enough. I stood firm. McCarthy threatened. I braved him to do his worst. We were to meet at the pool midway between our houses to talk it over.\n“When I went down there I found him talking with his son, so I smoked a cigar and waited behind a tree until he should be alone. But as I listened to his talk all that was black and bitter in me seemed to come uppermost. He was urging his son to marry my daughter with as little regard for what she might think as if she were a slut from off the streets. It drove me mad to think that I and all that I held most dear should be in the power of such a man as this. Could I not snap the bond? I was already a dying and a desperate man. Though clear of mind and fairly strong of limb, I knew that my own fate was sealed. But my memory and my girl! Both could be saved if I could but silence that foul tongue. I did it, Mr. Holmes. I would do it again. Deeply as I have sinned, I have led a life of martyrdom to atone for it. But that my girl should be entangled in the same meshes which held me was more than I could suffer. I struck him down with no more compunction than if he had been some foul and venomous beast. His cry brought back his son; but I had gained the cover of the wood, though I was forced to go back to fetch the cloak which I had dropped in my flight. That is the true story, gentlemen, of all that occurred.”",

His age and infirmity had bowed his shoulders and drawn his body into a decrepit shape, but the ruin of him was evidently that of a noble type. His head was massive, his face strongly lined with the furrows of anxiety and trouble. Power and dignity were indicated in the broad brow and firm chin, but a certain furtive glance, and a shrinking expression of the lips, seemed to show that there was more in his past life than he would wish to have known. He was dressed in sombre clothes, and his face was ashen in hue, telling of a severe illness. He entered with a limp and a shuffle, yet there was an air of force and resolution about his whole bearing. He sat down heavily in the chair which Holmes pushed forward, and he looked from one to the other of us with half-apprehensive, half-defiant eyes.\n\n“Good morning, Mr. Turner,” said Holmes. “I may say at once that the object of my visit is simply to obtain a statement from you. I presume that you would wish everything to be kept out of the papers.”\n\n“I did receive your note, sir,” said the man. “I came at once. Your name is well known to me, Mr. Holmes. You can do me a great injury, if you choose.”\n\n“My object is to do you good.”\n\n“To avert a scandal?”\n\n“Just so. I think it is possible to do so.”\n\n“You are aware of what has happened, then? You know why I am here?”\n\n“It was our terrible misfortune to be present at the county police office when James McCarthy was arrested. Mr. Lestrade, of Scotland Yard, asked us to look into the case, and we have done so.”\n\n“And you think?”—He halted, his whole face lighted up with an eager, questioning hope.\n\n“I think that James McCarthy is innocent of the death of his father. Probably I could go farther than that, and say that he had no hand in it whatever.”\n\n“You think so? You are sure of that?” cried Turner. “Pray God it may be so. But if your opinion is right, if this young man is innocent, then he will be acquitted at the Assizes, and I shall be dragged into the light. I have had twenty years of peace. Shall I lose my peace and my honour now? I would rather die.”\n\n“I did not say that you could continue to live with neither your peace nor your honour sullied. Pardon me, but I could not say what is not the truth. But I think that an arrangement is possible by which you may preserve the latter. You could not, of course, turn your back and walk out of this room as if these things had never been.”\n\n“I could not,” he moaned. “I could not.”\n\n“Now, Mr. Turner,” Holmes continued, “your daughter is not, so far as we know, associated in this matter.”\n\n“Ah, thank God for that!” cried the old man. “It was the great fear of my life that she should be dragged into the courts.”\n\n“It is only right, therefore, that she should be spared all pain and anxiety when the case is finally settled. We have every reason to believe that she is devoted to her father, and would mourn him deeply.”\n\n“She would, sir. She loves me dearly.”\n\n“So that the knowledge of your arrest would be a terrible blow to her.”\n\n“My arrest! You don’t think that they will arrest me?”\n\n“I will not deceive you, Mr. Turner. It is my duty to tell you that there is enough evidence in the possession of the police to justify your arrest.”\n\nHe leaned back in his chair, and a ghastly shutter passed over his face. “My God!” he cried. “What shall I do? What shall I do?”\n\n“The time for indecision is past,” said Holmes. “We have your secret, and whatever we do must be done at once. Mr. Watson and I are acting as private agents, and not as officials. We have not communicated with the police, nor do we intend to do so. If you choose to trust us, we promise you that everything you say shall be used for your own protection, and for the clearing of James McCarthy. At present you are both in a very awkward position, and it seems to me that the first thing is to clear him. What happened at Boscombe Pool?”\n\n“Look here, sir,” said Turner, standing up and opening his coat. “Look at that!” An undershirt was girdled round with a broad leather belt, and from this there was suspended, in a leather sheath, a heavy revolver with the butt peeping out. “I have my fears, Mr. Holmes,” said he. “I have my fears.”\n\n“I can see that you are an elderly and ailing man, Mr. Turner,” continued Holmes. “I fear, also, that we are wasting valuable time. James McCarthy has been arrested, and you are your own master to dispose of your life as you wish. All that I ask is that we should clear the innocent man, and I am sure that we can do so if we have your co-operation.”\n\n“Yes, yes; but at what price? At what price?”\n\n“If your statement is such as I think it will be, then I shall have a hold over the police and the lawyers which will enable me to secure James McCarthy’s freedom, and at the same time to prevent you from being charged with the murder.”\n\n“You can do that? You can save me from the gallows?”\n\n“I think so. But I cannot promise more than I can perform. I promise you that I will do my best.”\n\n“Well, then, this is the truth, and the whole truth, so help me God!” The old man’s eyes were cast up to the ceiling, and his voice sank into a broken whisper. “I’ll tell you all about Jim McCarthy and myself. My life has been a nightmare, a black nightmare, for twenty years.”\n\n“It must have been,” said Holmes. “We have had some glimmerings of it.”\n\n“It was in 1856 that the Ballarat gold-fields were at their height. My name then was not Turner, but was known as ‘Black Jack of Ballarat.’ The country was a wild one, the diggings were in a ferment, and the police were few and far from the scene of the trouble. There was a gang of us, fifty strong, and there was never a dare-devil risk which we did not take, and there was never a robbery we did not carry out. In 1862 a rich convoy of gold was transferred from Ballarat to Melbourne, and we lay in wait for it and attacked it. I was at the head of the gang, and we bagged a hundred and forty thousand pounds between us. There were six in my particular mess, and we got twenty-three thousand each. It was somewhere near the Lachlan River that we lay in ambush. I and two others got aboard of the coach, and covered the driver and guards with our pistols. I was just going to lower the driver from his box, when he whipped up his horses and sent them plunging down the road. We fired after him and brought down one of the horses, upon which the coach stopped and the man fell from the box. You can imagine that we were not very gentle with him, but when we had secured the gold and were about to push on, the man came to himself and held up his hand. He was a fine, powerful fellow, and his face was as brown as mahogany from exposure. He had an old scar across his forehead, and we could see a great cut over his eye. ‘Look here, mates,’ said he, ‘I’m not a driver at all, but I am a",

It is my duty to tell you that there is enough evidence in the possession of the police to justify your arrest.”\n\nHe leaned back in his chair, and a ghastly shutter passed over his face. “My God!” he cried. “What shall I do? What shall I do?”\n\n“The time for indecision is past,” said Holmes. “We have your secret, and whatever we do must be done at once. Mr. Watson and I are acting as private agents, and not as officials. We have not communicated with the police, nor do we intend to do so. If you choose to trust us, we promise you that everything you say shall be used for your own protection, and for the clearing of James McCarthy. At present you are both in a very awkward position, and it seems to me that the first thing is to clear him. What happened at Boscombe Pool?”\n\n“Look here, sir,” said Turner, standing up and opening his coat. “Look at that!” An undershirt was girdled round with a broad leather belt, and from this there was suspended, in a leather sheath, a heavy revolver with the butt peeping out. “I have my fears, Mr. Holmes,” said he. “I have my fears.”\n\n“I can see that you are an elderly and ailing man, Mr. Turner,” continued Holmes. “I fear, also, that we are wasting valuable time. James McCarthy has been arrested, and you are your own master to dispose of your life as you wish. All that I ask is that we should clear the innocent man, and I am sure that we can do so if we have your co-operation.”\n\n“Yes, yes; but at what price? At what price?”\n\n“If your statement is such as I think it will be, then I shall have a hold over the police and the lawyers which will enable me to secure James McCarthy’s freedom, and at the same time to prevent you from being charged with the murder.”\n\n“You can do that? You can save me from the gallows?”\n\n“I think so. But I cannot promise more than I can perform. I promise you that I will do my best.”\n\n“Well, then, this is the truth, and the whole truth, so help me God!” The old man’s eyes were cast up to the ceiling, and his voice sank into a broken whisper. “I’ll tell you all about Jim McCarthy and myself. My life has been a nightmare, a black nightmare, for twenty years.”\n\n“It must have been,” said Holmes. “We have had some glimmerings of it.”\n\n“It was in 1856 that the Ballarat gold-fields were at their height. My name then was not Turner, but was known as ‘Black Jack of Ballarat.’ The country was a wild one, the diggings were in a ferment, and the police were few and far from the scene of the trouble. There was a gang of us, fifty strong, and there was never a dare-devil risk which we did not take, and there was never a robbery we did not carry out. In 1862 a rich convoy of gold was transferred from Ballarat to Melbourne, and we lay in wait for it and attacked it. I was at the head of the gang, and we bagged a hundred and forty thousand pounds between us. There were six in my particular mess, and we got twenty-three thousand each. It was somewhere near the Lachlan River that we lay in ambush. I and two others got aboard of the coach, and covered the driver and guards with our pistols. I was just going to lower the driver from his box, when he whipped up his horses and sent them plunging down the road. We fired after him and brought down one of the horses, upon which the coach stopped and the man fell from the box. You can imagine that we were not very gentle with him, but when we had secured the gold and were about to push on, the man came to himself and held up his hand. He was a fine, powerful fellow, and his face was as brown as mahogany from exposure. He had an old scar across his forehead, and we could see a great cut over his eye. ‘Look here, mates,’ said he, ‘I’m not a driver at all, but I am a",

Some, however, have already gained publicity through the papers, and others have not offered a field for those peculiar qualities which my friend possessed in so high a degree, and which it is the object of these papers to illustrate. Some, too, have baffled his analytical skill, and would be, as narratives, beginnings without an ending, while others have been but partially cleared up, and have their explanations founded rather upon conjecture and surmise than on that absolute logical proof which was so dear to him. There is, however, one of these last which was so remarkable in its details and so startling in its results that I am tempted to give some account of it in spite of the fact that there are points in connection with it which never have been, and probably never will be, entirely cleared up.\nThe year ’87 furnished us with a long series of cases of greater or less interest, of which I retain the records. Among my headings under this one twelve months I find an account of the adventure of the Paradol Chamber, of the Amateur Mendicant Society, who held a luxurious club in the lower vault of a furniture warehouse, of the facts connected with the loss of the British barque Sophy Anderson, of the singular adventures of the Grice Patersons in the island of Uffa, and finally of the Camberwell poisoning case. In the latter, as may be remembered, Sherlock Holmes was able, by winding up the dead man’s watch, to prove that it had been wound up two hours before, and that therefore the deceased had gone to bed within that time—a deduction which was of the greatest importance in clearing up the case. All these I may sketch out at some future date, but none of them present such singular features as the strange train of circumstances which I have now taken up my pen to describe.",

As evening drew in, the storm grew higher and louder, and the wind cried and sobbed like a child in the chimney. Sherlock Holmes sat moodily at one side of the fireplace cross-indexing his records of crime, while I at the other was deep in one of Clark Russell’s fine sea-stories until the howl of the gale from without seemed to blend with the text, and the splash of the rain to lengthen out into the long swash of the sea waves. My wife was on a visit to her mother’s, and for a few days I was a dweller once more in my old quarters at Baker Street.\n“Why,” said I, glancing up at my companion, “that was surely the bell. Who could come to-night? Some friend of yours, perhaps?”\n“Except yourself I have none,” he answered. “I do not encourage visitors.”\n“A client, then?”\n“If so, it is a serious case. Nothing less would bring a man out on such a day and at such an hour. But I take it that it is more likely to be some crony of the landlady’s.”\nSherlock Holmes was wrong in his conjecture, however, for there came a step in the passage and a tapping at the door. He stretched out his long arm to turn the lamp away from himself and towards the vacant chair upon which a newcomer must sit.\n“Come in!” said he.",

His eyes, large and dark, held a look of profound trouble, darting nervously about the room before settling upon Sherlock Holmes with a desperate intensity. He carried a walking-stick, which he gripped tightly, his knuckles white, as if it were the only solid thing in a world that had suddenly become unstable. He hesitated for a moment on the threshold, a picture of indecision, before stepping fully into the room. His movements were quick and jerky, suggesting an inner turmoil that his outward appearance of breeding could not entirely conceal. He wore a dark, well-cut overcoat, and carried a hat in his hand, which he turned round and round with restless fingers. There was a faint tremor in his hands, and his lips were pressed together in a thin, anxious line.

It is a hereditary matter; so in order to give you an idea of the facts, I must go back to the commencement of the affair.\n“You must know that my grandfather had two sons—my uncle Elias and my father Joseph. My father had a small factory at Coventry, which he enlarged at the time of the invention of bicycling. He was a patentee of the Openshaw unbreakable tire, and his business met with such success that he was able to sell it and to retire upon a handsome competence.\n“My uncle Elias emigrated to America when he was a young man and became a planter in Florida, where he was reported to have done very well. At the time of the war he fought in Jackson’s army, and afterwards under Hood, where he rose to be a colonel. When Lee laid down his arms my uncle returned to his plantation, where he remained for three or four years. About 1869 or 1870 he came back to Europe and took a small estate in Sussex, near Horsham. He had made a very considerable fortune in the States, and his reason for leaving them was his aversion to the negroes, and his dislike of the Republican policy in extending the franchise to them. He was a singular man, fierce and quick-tempered, very foul-mouthed when he was angry, and of a most retiring disposition. During all the years that he lived at Horsham, I doubt if ever he set foot in the town. He had a garden and two or three fields round his house, and there he would take his exercise, though very often for weeks on end he would never leave his room. He drank a great deal of brandy and smoked very heavily, but he would see no society and did not want any friends, not even his own brother.\n“He didn’t mind me; in fact, he took a fancy to me, for at the time when he saw me first I was a youngster of twelve or so. This would be in the year 1878, after he had been eight or nine years in England. He begged my father to let me live with him and he was very kind to me in his way. When he was sober he used to be fond of playing backgammon and draughts with me, and he would make me his representative both with the servants and with the tradespeople, so that by the time that I was sixteen I was quite master of the house. I kept all the keys and could go where I liked and do what I liked, so long as I did not disturb him in his privacy. There was one singular exception, however, for he had a single room, a lumber-room up among the attics, which was invariably locked, and which he would never permit either me or anyone else to enter. With a boy’s curiosity I have peeped through the keyhole, but I was never able to see more than such a collection of old trunks and bundles as would be expected in such a room.",

            "In March 1883, Uncle Elias received a rare letter with a Pondicherry postmark.",
            "Upon opening it, five dried orange pips fell out.",
            "John's initial amusement turned to horror at his uncle's reaction: Elias's face turned putty-colored, his eyes bulged, and he shrieked 'K. K. K.!', followed by 'My God, my God, my sins have overtaken me!'",
            "When John asked what was wrong, Elias responded 'Death' and retreated to his room.",
            "John examined the envelope and found 'K K K' scrawled in red ink on the inner flap.",
            "Later, John encountered his uncle coming downstairs with an old key (likely for the attic room) and a small brass cashbox.",
            "Elias defiantly declared he would 'checkmate them' and instructed John to light a fire in his room and summon Fordham, the lawyer.",
            "When the lawyer arrived, John was called into the room, where the fire blazed and a mass of burned paper ashes lay in the grate next to the open, empty brass box.",
            "John noticed with a start that the box lid bore the same 'K K K' inscription as the envelope.",
            "Elias had John witness his will, leaving his estate (with all 'advantages and disadvantages') to John's father, advising that if it couldn't be enjoyed peacefully, it should be given to one's worst enemy.",
            "John signed the will, deeply disturbed by the incident and filled with a lingering sense of dread.",
            "Elias's behavior worsened; he drank more, became more reclusive, and had episodes of drunken frenzy, rushing outside with a revolver, shouting defiance, only to retreat back indoors in terror.",
            "One night, during such an episode, Elias disappeared.",
            "He was found dead, face down in a shallow, green-scummed garden pool.",
            "With no signs of violence and considering Elias's eccentricity, the verdict was suicide.",
            "John, however, doubted this, knowing his uncle's fear of death.",
            "John's father inherited the estate and about £14,000.",

          "text_segment": "“One day—it was in March, 1883—a letter with a foreign stamp lay upon the table in front of the colonel’s plate. It was not a common thing for him to receive letters, for his bills were all paid in ready money, and he had no friends of any sort. ‘From India!’ said he as he took it up, ‘Pondicherry postmark! What can this be?’ Opening it hurriedly, out there jumped five little dried orange pips, which pattered down upon his plate. I began to laugh at this, but the laugh was struck from my lips at the sight of his face. His lip had fallen, his eyes were protruding, his skin the colour of putty, and he glared at the envelope which he still held in his trembling hand, ‘K. K. K.!’ he shrieked, and then, ‘My God, my God, my sins have overtaken me!’\n“‘What is it, uncle?’ I cried.\n“‘Death,’ said he, and rising from the table he retired to his room, leaving me palpitating with horror. I took up the envelope and saw scrawled in red ink upon the inner flap, just above the gum, the letter K three times repeated. There was nothing else save the five dried pips. What could be the reason of his overpowering terror? I left the breakfast-table, and as I ascended the stair I met him coming down with an old rusty key, which must have belonged to the attic, in one hand, and a small brass box, like a cashbox, in the other.\n“‘They may do what they like, but I’ll checkmate them still,’ said he with an oath. ‘Tell Mary that I shall want a fire in my room to-day, and send down to Fordham, the Horsham lawyer.’\n“I did as he ordered, and when the lawyer arrived I was asked to step up to the room. The fire was burning brightly, and in the grate there was a mass of black, fluffy ashes, as of burned paper, while the brass box stood open and empty beside it. As I glanced at the box I noticed, with a start, that upon the lid was printed the treble K which I had read in the morning upon the envelope.\n“‘I wish you, John,’ said my uncle, ‘to witness my will. I leave my estate, with all its advantages and all its disadvantages, to my brother, your father, whence it will, no doubt, descend to you. If you can enjoy it in peace, well and good! If you find you cannot, take my advice, my boy, and leave it to your deadliest enemy. I am sorry to give you such a two-edged thing, but I can’t say what turn things are going to take. Kindly sign the paper where Mr. Fordham shows you.’\n“I signed the paper as directed, and the lawyer took it away with him. The singular incident made, as you may think, the deepest impression upon me, and I pondered over it and turned it every way in my mind without being able to make anything of it. Yet I could not shake off the vague feeling of dread which it left behind, though the sensation grew less keen as the weeks passed and nothing happened to disturb the usual routine of our lives. I could see a change in my uncle, however. He drank more than ever, and he was less inclined for any sort of society. Most of his time he would spend in his room, with the door locked upon the inside, but sometimes he would emerge in a sort of drunken frenzy and would burst out of the house and tear about the garden with a revolver in his hand, screaming out that he was afraid of no man, and that he was not to be cooped up, like a sheep in a pen, by man or devil. When these hot fits were over, however, he would rush tumultuously in at the door and lock and bar it behind him, like a man who can brazen it out no longer against the terror which lies at the roots of his soul. At such times I have seen his face, even on a cold day, glisten with moisture, as though it were new raised from a basin.\n“Well, to come to an end of the matter, Mr. Holmes, and not to abuse your patience, there came a night when he made one of those drunken sallies from which he never came back. We found him, when we went to search for him, face downward in a little green-scummed pool, which lay at the foot of the garden. There was no sign of any violence, and the water was but two feet deep, so that the jury, having regard to his known eccentricity, brought in a verdict of ‘suicide.’ But I, who knew how he winced from the very thought of death, had much ado to persuade myself that he had gone out of his way to meet it. The matter passed, however, and my father entered into possession of the estate, and of some £ 14,000, which lay to his credit at the bank.”\n“One moment,” Holmes interposed, “your statement is, I foresee, one of the most remarkable to which I have ever listened. Let me have the date of the reception by your uncle of the letter, and the date of his supposed suicide.”\n“The letter arrived on March 10, 1883. His death was seven weeks later, upon the night of May 2nd.”\n“Thank you. Pray proceed.”",

It was from India, and the postmark a very unusual one—Pondicherry. The colonel stared at it for a long time, but never offered to open it. At last my father asked him if he was not going to do so. ‘No,’ said he, ‘I have a presentiment that there is evil in it, and yet I know that it must be opened.’ At last he tore it open and in an instant afterwards his face became livid with a terrible fear. He crumpled up the letter and its contents and hurled them into the fire. We glanced at them, and they were only five dried orange pips. We were all astonished at his agitation and asked him what was the matter. He did not answer us, but sat staring into the fire with a dreadful expression upon his face. For hours he was sunk in the deepest thought and it was not until after dinner that he at last opened his mouth. He then told us that he knew what the five orange pips meant, and that they were a message of death to him. He had received a similar message when he was in India, and he knew that he had not long to live. He was a brave man, however, and he determined to face his fate with courage. He made his will, and left all his property to my father, with the understanding that it should pass to me upon my father’s death. He also gave us some instructions as to what we should do in case of his death. He then shut himself up in his room and refused to see anyone. For weeks he remained in this state, and we were all very anxious about him. One night, however, he came down to us and told us that he had received another message, and that he knew that his end was near. He was very calm and collected, and he gave us some further instructions. He then went back to his room, and in the morning we found that he was dead. He had died in the night, and there was no sign of violence upon his body. The doctor said that he had died of heart disease, but we knew that it was the five orange pips that had killed him. My father inherited the property, and for some time all went well. But then my father began to receive the same messages that my uncle had received. He was a brave man, like his brother, but he could not stand the strain. He died within a few weeks of receiving the first message, and I was left alone with the property. I have now received the same message, and I know that my end is near. I have come to you, Mr. Holmes, because I know that you are the only man who can help me. I am not afraid of death, but I do not want to die without knowing who it is that is pursuing me. I have brought with me all the papers that I could find relating to the matter, and I hope that you will be able to throw some light upon it.” Holmes listened with the deepest attention to this extraordinary narrative. “This is a very strange case,” said he, when Mr. Openshaw had finished. “It is clear that there is some secret society which is pursuing your family, and that it is determined to exterminate it. The five orange pips are a symbol which is used by this society, and it is a message of death to those who receive it. The society is clearly a very powerful one, and it has agents all over the world. It is probable that your uncle offended this society in some way, and that he was marked down for vengeance. Your father inherited the feud, and he too was marked down. And now you have inherited it, and you too are in danger. It is a terrible position for you to be in, and I do not wonder that you are anxious. But I will do my best to help you. I will examine the papers which you have brought with you, and I will see if I can find any clue to the identity of this society. In the meantime, you must be very careful. You must not go out alone, and you must always be on your guard. It is possible that the agents of the society are already in London, and that they are watching you.” “I will do as you advise,” said Mr. Openshaw. “I am not afraid of death, but I do not want to be taken by surprise.” “That is wise,” said Holmes. “And now, let us look at these papers.” He took the packet of papers from Mr. Openshaw and began to examine them. They consisted of a number of letters and documents, all of which related to the history of the Openshaw family. Holmes read them carefully, and from time to time he made a note in his notebook. At last he finished reading, and he sat for some time in deep thought. “There is a great deal of interesting information here,” said he at last. “It is clear that your family has been involved in some very strange affairs. It seems that your grandfather was a member of a secret society which was known as the Ku Klux Klan. This society was founded in the Southern States of America after the Civil War, and it was composed of men who were opposed to the emancipation of the slaves. It was a very violent society, and it committed many murders and outrages. Your grandfather was a prominent member of this society, and he was involved in many of its activities. It seems that he brought some of the secrets of the society with him when he came to England, and that he passed them on to your uncle. Your uncle, in turn, passed them on to your father, and your father passed them on to you. It is clear that the society is now pursuing you in order to recover these secrets.” “But what are these secrets?” asked Mr. Openshaw. “That is what we have to find out,” said Holmes. “It is possible that they are contained in the papers which you have brought with you. Or it is possible that they are in some other place. We must search for them, and we must find them before the agents of the society do.” “But how can we search for them?” asked Mr. Openshaw. “We must go to your house,” said Holmes, “and we must search every corner of it. It is possible that the secrets are hidden in some secret place.” “But I have already searched the house,” said Mr. Openshaw, “and I have found nothing.” “That does not matter,” said Holmes. “We must search it again, and we must search it more carefully. It is possible that you have overlooked something.” “Very well,” said Mr. Openshaw. “I will go back to my house, and I will wait for you there.” “No,” said Holmes, “you must not go back to your house alone. It is too dangerous. You must stay here with me,",

            "prefix-probing": "“One day—it was in March, 1883—a letter with a foreign stamp lay upon the table in front of the colonel’s plate. He picked it up and opened it. Inside there was a note from a firm of lawyers in the City, and in the note was enclosed a letter from a Colonel Lysander Stark, who was apparently residing at some country house in Berkshire. It was a singular letter, and the lawyers explained that they had simply forwarded it as it had been sent to them with a very large fee and instructions that it was to be delivered at once. ‘Dear Sir,’ said the colonel’s letter, ‘it has been held in the profession that a hydraulic press is a thing which cannot be made to err if only you are sufficiently careful to keep clear of it. My lawyers, Messrs. Fairlie, Henderson, and Peake, of the Minories, have suggested your name to me as being a man who understands hydraulic presses thoroughly. This knowledge of yours I have occasion to make use of, but it is most important that the matter should be kept a profound secret and that you should come to me to-night, without fail, at a quarter to ten. It is necessary that you should come by the 9.13 train from Paddington, and I will have a carriage waiting for you at Eyford Station. There is a fee of five guineas which shall be paid you in any case, and a further fee of twenty guineas if you can render me the assistance I require. Yours faithfully, Lysander Stark.’\n\n“This letter, as you may imagine, filled me with utter astonishment. It is true that I am a hydraulic engineer, and that I have had considerable experience of presses. There is no other man in the profession, I venture to say, who knows as much about their defects as I do. I have had occasion to look into the matter, and I am convinced that there is a point of weakness about the piston where it enters the cylinder. It was a discovery of my own, and I have not hesitated to publish it. But why this man should come to me in such a fashion, and with such an offer, I could not imagine. I was not a consulting engineer, and I had no wish to be one. I was a practical man, and I had no time for such work. Besides, the secrecy was most suspicious. However, the fee was a very large one, and I was a poor man. I had only been in practice a few months, and I had not yet made my name. I had a small office in Victoria Street, and I was waiting for work. The offer was a godsend, and I could not refuse it. I wrote a note to the lawyers to say that I would come, and I packed a small bag with a few things that I might need.\n\n“I was at Paddington Station at the appointed time, and I took my ticket for Eyford. The train was a slow one, and it was nearly ten o’clock when I arrived at my destination. A brougham was waiting outside the station, and the driver, a short, stout fellow, asked me if I was Mr. Hatherley. I said that I was, and he helped me into the carriage. ‘You are to be blindfolded, sir,’ he said. ‘It is the colonel’s orders.’ I was not surprised, for the letter had prepared me for something of the kind. I submitted, and a thick handkerchief was bound over my eyes. The carriage started, and we drove for what seemed to me to be a very long time. We went over a rough road, and then over a smooth one, and then over a rough one again. We turned corners, and we went up hills and down them. I had no idea where we were going, but I knew that we were going away from the station, and that we were going into the country. At last the carriage stopped, and the driver helped me out. He took me by the arm and led me up a flight of steps, and then through a door. He removed the handkerchief from my eyes, and I found myself in a large, dimly lit hall. A man was standing in front of me, and I knew at once that it was Colonel Lysander Stark. He was a tall, thin man, with a long, sallow face, and a pair of keen, restless eyes. He had a military bearing, but his clothes were civilian. He bowed to me and said, ‘Mr. Hatherley, I am glad to see you. You are very punctual.’\n\n“He led me into a room which was furnished as a study. There was a large table in the centre, and a number of chairs around it. On the table there were some papers and a lamp. The room was warm and comfortable, but there was a strange smell about it, a smell which I could not at first identify. The colonel sat down and motioned me to a chair. ‘Mr. Hatherley,’ he said, ‘I have a very delicate piece of work which I wish you to do for me. It is a matter of the utmost secrecy, and I must ask you to give me your word of honour that you will not speak of it to anyone.’ I gave him my word, and he went on. ‘I have a hydraulic press here which is not working properly. It is a very large one, and it is used for a very important purpose. I wish you to examine it and to tell me what is wrong with it. If you can put it right, I will pay you the fee which I promised you.’\n\n“He then led me out of the room and down a long passage. At the end of the passage there was a door, and he opened it and led me into a large, lofty room. This room was evidently a workshop. There were tools of all kinds lying about, and in the centre of the room there was a huge hydraulic press. It was a magnificent machine, but it was not in working order. The piston was jammed, and the cylinder was cracked. I examined it carefully, and I saw at once what was wrong. It was"

For the rest, there was nothing of much importance in the attic save a great many scattered papers and note-books bearing upon my uncle’s life in America. Some of them were of the war time and showed that he had done his duty well and had borne the repute of a brave soldier.

He had always laughed at what he called my cock-and-bull story about the colonel, but he looked very scared and puzzled now that the same thing had come upon himself.\n“‘Why, what on earth does this mean, John?’ he stammered.\n“My heart had turned to lead. ‘It is K. K. K.,’ said I.\n“He looked inside the envelope. ‘So it is,’ he cried. ‘Here are the very letters. But what is this written above them?’\n“‘Put the papers on the sundial,’ I read, peeping over his shoulder.\n“‘What papers? What sundial?’ he asked.\n“‘The sundial in the garden. There is no other,’ said I; ‘but the papers must be those that are destroyed.’\n“‘Pooh!’ said he, gripping hard at his courage. ‘We are in a civilised land here, and we can’t have tomfoolery of this kind. Where does the thing come from?’\n“‘From Dundee,’ I answered, glancing at the postmark.\n“‘Some preposterous practical joke,’ said he. ‘What have I to do with sundials and papers? I shall take no notice of such nonsense.’\n“‘I should certainly speak to the police,’ I said.\n“‘And be laughed at for my pains. Nothing of the sort.’\n“‘Then let me do so?’\n“‘No, I forbid you. I won’t have a fuss made about such nonsense.’\n“It was in vain to argue with him, for he was a very obstinate man. I went about, however, with a heart which was full of forebodings.\n“On the third day after the coming of the letter my father went from home to visit an old friend of his, Major Freebody, who is in command of one of the forts upon Portsdown Hill. I was glad that he should go, for it seemed to me that he was farther from danger when he was away from home. In that, however, I was in error. Upon the second day of his absence I received a telegram from the major, imploring me to come at once. My father had fallen over one of the deep chalk-pits which abound in the neighbourhood, and was lying senseless, with a shattered skull. I hurried to him, but he passed away without having ever recovered his consciousness. He had, as it appears, been returning from Fareham in the twilight, and as the country was unknown to him, and the chalk-pit unfenced, the jury had no hesitation in bringing in a verdict of ‘death from accidental causes.’ Carefully as I examined every fact connected with his death, I was unable to find anything which could suggest the idea of murder. There were no signs of violence, no footmarks, no robbery, no record of strangers having been seen upon the roads. And yet I need not tell you that my mind was far from at ease, and that I was well-nigh certain that some foul plot had been woven round him.\n“In this sinister way I came into my inheritance. You will ask me why I did not dispose of it? I answer, because I was well convinced that our troubles were in some way dependent upon an incident in my uncle’s life, and that the danger would be as pressing in one house as in another.",

              "simple_agent_extraction": "When my father took over the Horsham property, he, at my request, made a careful examination of the attic, which had been always locked up. We found the brass box there, and it was empty, with a slip of paper inside upon which was written 'Letters, memoranda, receipts, and a register destroyed by fire, January 4th, 1883.' Besides this box, there were a number of papers, none of which seemed of very great importance, but which served to show that my uncle had led a very quiet life, and was highly respected in the community. One of them was a commission in the Confederate army, and another was a parchment certificate of honorary membership in one of the political clubs which sprang up in the South after the war. There were many letters from his friends, and a few private papers of his own, all of which were commonplace in the extreme. There was nothing at all which could explain the sinister circumstances which surrounded his death. As I have said, he had gone to America in 1862, and returned in 1869. In 1870 he had purchased the Horsham estate, and lived there quietly until his death in 1883. My father came into possession in 1884, and lived in this quiet country house until January 1885. On the fourth day of that month, I well remember, I was sitting with my father after breakfast, when the postman brought in a single letter. It was enclosed in a plain yellow envelope, and was unaddressed and unsealed. It contained nothing but five dried orange pips. My father turned it over and over, and looked at it curiously. 'Well, John, what do you make of this?' he asked. 'Make of it!' I cried. 'Why, it is the same as came to Uncle Elias from America.' My father's face was white and drawn, and his little eyes were peering all over the room, as if in search of some unseen enemy. 'It is nonsense, John,' said he at last, with a sort of laugh; 'we will not mind it, you know. But what could have come to your uncle to frighten him so?' I said nothing, but I felt that this was no laughing matter, and that he was more frightened than he pretended. 'Well, but what is it, anyhow?' he asked. 'What does it mean?' 'It is a warning,' I said. 'From whom?' 'From the same people who warned Uncle Elias.' 'But what do they warn us against?' 'Against something which he has done, or neglected to do. And you have inherited it.' 'But what is it, John?' 'I don't know, father. But it is something terrible.' He sat for some time in silence, with the pips in his hand. Then he looked at the envelope. Upon the back of it was written in rough, irregular characters, 'K. K. K.' and above it 'Put the papers on the sundial.' 'What papers? What sundial?' he asked. 'The papers which were destroyed,' I suggested. 'And the sundial in the garden.' 'But if they were destroyed, how can I put them on the sundial? And what is this K. K. K.?' I explained my theory about the Ku Klux Klan, and the letter which had been sent to my uncle. He listened intently, but shrugged his shoulders. 'It is all tomfoolery,' said he. 'This is some practical joke, and no doubt comes from Dundee, where the postmark is.' 'But why should anyone play such a joke upon us?' 'Well, you know, John, your uncle was a very eccentric man, and he may have had enemies whom we know nothing of. I am sure that this is nothing serious.' 'But the death of Uncle Elias?' 'That was accidental, as the jury found. You must not dwell upon it, John. We are quiet, law-abiding folk, and have nothing to fear.' He spoke bravely, but I could see that he was not at ease. That night he did not sleep well, and the next morning he was pale and troubled. He said nothing more about the letter, but I could see that it was weighing heavily upon his mind. Three days later he received another letter, also from Dundee, and also containing five orange pips. This time the message was 'Put the papers on the sundial by January 29th.' 'Well, father,' said I, 'what are you going to do?' 'Nothing,' said he. 'I will not be bullied by these rascals.' 'But it is a warning, father.' 'I know it is, John. But I will not give in to them. I have done nothing wrong, and I have nothing to fear.' He was very obstinate, and I could not persuade him to take any steps. I suggested that he should go to the police, but he would not hear of it. 'No,' said he, 'I will not have my name mixed up with such a business. It would be the talk of the county.' I was very uneasy, and I could see that he was too, though he tried to hide it. On the third day after the second letter, he went to visit Major Freebody, an old friend of his, who lived near Fareham. I was glad that he had gone, for I thought that he would be safer away from home. But I was wrong. On the second day of his absence I received a telegram from the Major. 'Come at once. Your father has met with a serious accident.' I hurried down to Fareham",

During that time I have lived happily at Horsham, and I had begun to hope that this curse had passed away from the family, and that it had ended with the last generation. I had begun to take comfort too soon, however; yesterday morning the blow fell in the very shape in which it had come upon my father.”\nThe young man took from his waistcoat a crumpled envelope, and turning to the table he shook out upon it five little dried orange pips.\n“This is the envelope,” he continued. “The postmark is London—eastern division. Within are the very words which were upon my father’s last message: ‘K. K. K.’; and then ‘Put the papers on the sundial.’”\n“What have you done?” asked Holmes.\n“Nothing.”\n“Nothing?”\n“To tell the truth”—he sank his face into his thin, white hands—“I have felt helpless. I have felt like one of those poor rabbits when the snake is writhing towards it. I seem to be in the grasp of some resistless, inexorable evil, which no foresight and no precautions can guard against.”\n“Tut! tut!” cried Sherlock Holmes. “You must act, man, or you are lost. Nothing but energy can save you. This is no time for despair.”\n“I have seen the police.”\n“Ah!”\n“But they listened to my story with a smile. I am convinced that the inspector has formed the opinion that the letters are all practical jokes, and that the deaths of my relations were really accidents, as the jury stated, and were not to be connected with the warnings.”\nHolmes shook his clenched hands in the air. “Incredible imbecility!” he cried.\n“They have, however, allowed me a policeman, who may remain in the house with me.”\n“Has he come with you to-night?”\n“No. His orders were to stay in the house.”\nAgain Holmes raved in the air.\n“Why did you come to me?” he said, “and, above all, why did you not come at once?”\n“I did not know. It was only to-day that I spoke to Major Prendergast about my troubles and was advised by him to come to you.”\n“It is really two days since you had the letter. We should have acted before this. You have no further evidence, I suppose, than that which you have placed before us—no suggestive detail which might help us?”\n“There is one thing,” said John Openshaw. He rummaged in his coat pocket, and, drawing out a piece of discoloured, blue-tinted paper, he laid it out upon the table. “I have some remembrance,” said he, “that on the day when my uncle burned the papers I observed that the small, unburned margins which lay amid the ashes were of this particular colour. I found this single sheet upon the floor of his room, and I am inclined to think that it may be one of the papers which has, perhaps, fluttered out from among the others, and in that way has escaped destruction. Beyond the mention of pips, I do not see that it helps us much. I think myself that it is a page from some private diary. The writing is undoubtedly my uncle’s.”\nHolmes moved the lamp, and we both bent over the sheet of paper, which showed by its ragged edge that it had indeed been torn from a book. It was headed, “March, 1869,” and beneath were the following enigmatical notices:\n“4th. Hudson came. Same old platform.\n“7th. Set the pips on McCauley, Paramore, and John Swain of St. Augustine.\n“9th. McCauley cleared.\n“10th. John Swain cleared.\n“12th. Visited Paramore. All well.”",

            "prefix-probing": "It was in January, ’85, that my poor father met his end, and two years and eight months have elapsed since then. My mother had been married twice, and I was the daughter of the second marriage. My sister Julia was ten years older than I, and was the daughter of the first. When my father died, we were left to the care of our stepfather, Dr. Grimesby Roylott, of Stoke Moran, in the western counties. He was a man of excellent family, a descendant of the ancient Saxon squires of Stoke Moran, and had been, when young, of a wild and dissolute nature, and had spent a considerable part of his youth in India, where he had married my mother, Mrs. Stoner, the widow of Major-General Anderson, of the Bengal Artillery. She may have had some reason to regret it, for Dr. Grimesby Roylott was a man of terrible temper, and of great physical strength. In a fit of anger, he had beaten his native butler to death, and had only just escaped a capital sentence. He had returned to England a morose and disappointed man, and a series of lawsuits and ill-advised speculations had reduced the four-figure income which he had inherited from my mother to a pittance. The only remnants of his past grandeur were a few pieces of furniture and a small annuity. By the time he came to live with us, he was the terror of the village, and his only friends were the wandering gypsies, and a cheetah and a baboon which he had brought with him from India. We lived a very retired life. Few visitors came to the house, and we were forbidden to have any friends. My sister Julia was a sweet, amiable girl, and she and I were all in all to one another. She was engaged to be married to a major of marines, and the wedding was fixed for the spring. It was a cold, bleak March night, and my sister and I had gone to bed early. Our rooms were on the ground floor, and they opened on to the lawn. My sister’s room was next to mine, and there was a communicating door between them, but it was seldom used. That night, my sister was restless, and she could not sleep. She told me that she had heard a low whistle, and a metallic clang. I tried to soothe her, but she was very nervous. Suddenly, I was awakened by a scream. I sprang out of bed, and ran to the communicating door. It was locked on the inside. I hammered at it, but there was no answer. I then ran round to the window, and looked in. My sister was standing in the middle of the room, swaying backwards and forwards. Her face was as white as death, and her eyes were fixed with horror. As I looked, she fell to the ground. I rushed to the door, and burst it open. She was lying on the floor, her body convulsed. I raised her head, and she gasped out, “Oh, Helen! It was the band! The speckled band!” There was a strong smell of cigars in the room. We sent for the doctor, but it was too late. She died in my arms. The police made the most careful inquiries, but they could not find any trace of violence. The windows were fastened on the inside, and the door was locked. The only clue was my sister’s dying words, but we could make nothing of them. I have lived with my stepfather ever since"

You must put this piece of paper which you have shown us into the brass box which you have described. You must also put in a note to say that all the other papers were burned by your uncle, and that this is the only one which remains. You must assert that in such words as will carry conviction with them. Having done this, you must at once put the box out upon the sundial, as directed. Do you understand?”\n“Entirely.”\n“Do not think of revenge, or anything of the sort, at present.

The second is to clear up the mystery and to punish the guilty parties.”\n“I thank you,” said the young man, rising and pulling on his overcoat. “You have given me fresh life and hope. I shall certainly do as you advise.”\n“Do not lose an instant. And, above all, take care of yourself in the meanwhile, for I do not think that there can be a doubt that you are threatened by a very real and imminent danger. How do you go back?”\n“By train from Waterloo.”\n“It is not yet nine. The streets will be crowded, so I trust that you may be in safety. And yet you cannot guard yourself too closely.”\n“I am armed.”\n“That is well. To-morrow I shall set to work upon your case.”\n“I shall see you at Horsham, then?”\n“No, your secret lies in London. It is there that I shall seek it.”\n“Then I shall call upon you in a day, or in two days, with news as to the box and the papers.

Then he lit his pipe, and leaning back in his chair he watched the blue smoke-rings as they chased each other up to the ceiling.\n“I think, Watson,” he remarked at last, “that of all our cases we have had none more fantastic than this.”\n“Save, perhaps, the Sign of Four.”\n“Well, yes. Save, perhaps, that. And yet this John Openshaw seems to me to be walking amid even greater perils than did the Sholtos.”\n“But have you,” I asked, “formed any definite conception as to what these perils are?”\n“There can be no question as to their nature,” he answered.\n“Then what are they? Who is this K. K. K., and why does he pursue this unhappy family?”\nSherlock Holmes closed his eyes and placed his elbows upon the arms of his chair, with his finger-tips together. “The ideal reasoner,” he remarked, “would, when he had once been shown a single fact in all its bearings, deduce from it not only all the chain of events which led up to it but also all the results which would follow from it. As Cuvier could correctly describe a whole animal by the contemplation of a single bone, so the observer who has thoroughly understood one link in a series of incidents should be able to accurately state all the other ones, both before and after. We have not yet grasped the results which the reason alone can attain to. Problems may be solved in the study which have baffled all those who have sought a solution by the aid of their senses. To carry the art, however, to its highest pitch, it is necessary that the reasoner should be able to utilise all the facts which have come to his knowledge; and this in itself implies, as you will readily see, a possession of all knowledge, which, even in these days of free education and encyclopædias, is a somewhat rare accomplishment. It is not so impossible, however, that a man should possess all knowledge which is likely to be useful to him in his work, and this I have endeavoured in my case to do. If I remember rightly, you on one occasion, in the early days of our friendship, defined my limits in a very precise fashion.”\n“Yes,” I answered, laughing. “It was a singular document. Philosophy, astronomy, and politics were marked at zero, I remember. Botany variable, geology profound as regards the mud-stains from any region within fifty miles of town, chemistry eccentric, anatomy unsystematic, sensational literature and crime records unique, violin-player, boxer, swordsman, lawyer, and self-poisoner by cocaine and tobacco. Those, I think, were the main points of my analysis.”\nHolmes grinned at the last item. “Well,” he said, “I say now, as I said then, that a man should keep his little brain-attic stocked with all the furniture that he is likely to use, and the rest he can put away in the lumber-room of his library, where he can get it if he wants it. Now, for such a case as the one which has been submitted to us to-night, we need certainly to muster all our resources. Kindly hand me down the letter K of the American Encyclopædia which stands upon the shelf beside you. Thank you. Now let us consider the situation and see what may be deduced from it. In the first place, we may start with a strong presumption that Colonel Openshaw had some very strong reason for leaving America. Men at his time of life do not change all their habits and exchange willingly the charming climate of Florida for the lonely life of an English provincial town. His extreme love of solitude in England suggests the idea that he was in fear of someone or something, so we may assume as a working hypothesis that it was fear of someone or something which drove him from America. As to what it was he feared, we can only deduce that by considering the formidable letters which were received by himself and his successors. Did you remark the postmarks of those letters?”\n“The first was from Pondicherry, the second from Dundee, and the third from London.”\n“From East London. What do you deduce from that?”\n“They are all seaports. That the writer was on board of a ship.”\n“Excellent. We have already a clue. There can be no doubt that the probability—the strong probability—is that the writer was on board of a ship. And now let us consider another point. In the case of Pondicherry, seven weeks elapsed between the threat and its fulfilment, in Dundee it was only some three or four days. Does that suggest anything?”\n“A greater distance to travel.”\n“But the letter had also a greater distance to come.”\n“Then I do not see the point.”\n“There is at least a presumption that the vessel in which the man or men are is a sailing-ship. It looks as if they always send their singular warning or token before them when starting upon their mission. You see how quickly the deed followed the sign when it came from Dundee. If they had come from Pondicherry in a steamer they would have arrived almost as soon as their letter. But, as a matter of fact, seven weeks elapsed. I think that those seven weeks represented the difference between the mail-boat which brought the letter and the sailing vessel which brought the writer.”\n“It is possible.”\n“More than that. It is probable. And now you see the deadly urgency of this new case, and why I urged young Openshaw to caution. The blow has always fallen at the end of the time which it would take the senders to travel the distance. But this one comes from London, and therefore we cannot count upon delay.”\n“Good God!” I cried. “What can it mean, this relentless persecution?”\n“The papers which Openshaw carried are obviously of vital importance to the person or persons in the sailing-ship. I think that it is quite clear that there must be more than one of them. A single man could not have carried out two deaths in such a way as to deceive a coroner’s jury. There must have been several in it, and they must have been men of resource and determination. Their papers they mean to have, be the holder of them who it may. In this way you see K. K. K. ceases to be the initials of an individual and becomes the badge of a society.”\n“But of what society?”\n“Have you never—” said Sherlock Holmes, bending forward and sinking his voice—“have you never heard of the Ku Klux Klan?”",

Then he lit his pipe, and leaning back in his chair he watched the blue smoke curl up from it. \"I am afraid, Watson,\" said he at last, \"that you will get little credit from this case. I think that you are yourself aware of as much as I am. There is little to be done save to wait for the monthly report from the inspectors of the Dundee police.\" \"And yet the case is, in itself, most instructive,\" remarked I. \"It is as I have often told you, Watson, that when you have eliminated the impossible, whatever remains, however improbable, must be the truth. We may not be able to give the exact date at which the orange pips were placed in the envelope, for the letter was six days on its way, but we can say that they were mailed at Pondicherry upon January 29th, and that the man who mailed them was aboard a sailing ship which was starting for England. And on the 3rd of February we can say that the gentleman who received the letter in London died, and that his death was caused by fright, which we can prove by the evidence of the doctor who saw him. It is a case, Watson, which may well rank with that of the Sign of Four.\" \"You think, then, that the gentleman who has just left us is in danger?\" \"He is, I fancy, in considerable danger. I should say, in very grave danger.\" \"But you say that this is a maritime case. How then can he be in danger?\" \"Because the men who are after him are on shore. The letter was posted in London, and the men are in London. That is why I say that he is in very grave danger.\" \"But surely, Holmes, you have a clue?\" \"You will not, I am sure, be able to find one. There is not a single clue in the whole business. The only thing that we have to go upon is the letter, and that tells us nothing save that the man who wrote it was on a sailing ship which was starting for England.\" \"But the orange pips?\" \"Ah, yes, the orange pips. They are, I think, the most suggestive part of the whole business. They are, you see, five in number, and they were sent in an envelope which was addressed to the gentleman who has just left us. Now, what do you make of that?\" \"I can make nothing of it.\" \"Well, I think that we may take it that the five orange pips are a warning. They are a warning that the man who received them is in danger.\" \"But from whom?\" \"Ah, that is the question. From whom?\" \"And what is the meaning of K.K.K.?\" \"That is, I think, the most important question of all. What is the meaning of K.K.K.?\" Holmes leaned back in his chair and closed his eyes. For a long time he sat in silence, and I did not care to interrupt him. At last he opened his eyes and looked at me. \"Watson,\" said he, \"I believe that I have solved the problem.\" \"You have found out what K.K.K. means?\" \"I think so. I think that it means the Ku Klux Klan.\" \"The Ku Klux Klan!\" I exclaimed. \"But what is that?\" \"It is a society which was formed in the Southern States of America after the Civil War. It was a society of terrorists, and its object was to prevent the negroes from exercising their rights as citizens. It was a very powerful society, and it committed many murders.\" \"But what has that to do with this case?\" \"I think that it has everything to do with this case. I think that the gentleman who has just left us is in danger from the Ku Klux Klan.\" \"But why?\" \"Because his father was a member of the Ku Klux Klan, and he has inherited his father's papers. I think that the Ku Klux Klan wants those papers.\" \"But why should they want them?\" \"Because they are afraid that they may be used as evidence against them.\" \"I see. And you think that they have killed his uncle and his father?\" \"I think it is very probable. You see, the Ku Klux Klan is a very powerful society, and it is not likely to stick at trifles.\" \"And you think that they are now after him?\" \"I think it is very probable. You see, he is the only one left who knows where the papers are.\" \"Then what is to be done?\" \"I think that we should warn him. We should tell him that he is in danger, and that he should take precautions.\" \"But what precautions can he take?\" \"He should, I think, go to the police. He should tell them the whole story, and he should ask for their protection.\" \"But will they believe him?\" \"I think that they will. You see, the story is a very strange one, and it is not likely to have been invented.\" \"And you think that the police will be able to protect him?\" \"I think that they will do their best. But the Ku Klux Klan is a very powerful society, and it is not likely to be easily put down.\" \"Then what do you advise?\" \"I advise that we should go to the police at once. We should tell them the whole story, and we should ask for their protection for the gentleman who has just left us.\" \"Very good,\" said I. \"Let us go at once.\" I rose from my chair, but Holmes did not move. \"I think,\" said he, \"that there is one more thing that we should do.\" \"What is that?\" \"I think that we should send a telegram to the police at Dundee. We should tell them that we have reason to believe that the gentleman who was murdered there was a member of the Ku Klux Klan, and that his death was caused by the Ku Klux Klan.\" \"But why should we do that?\" \"Because it may help them to find the murderers.\" \"I see. Very good. Let us do that at once.\" Holmes rose from his chair and went to the writing-table. He wrote out a telegram and handed it to me. \"Here,\" said he, \"take this to the telegraph office and send it off at once.\" I took the telegram and went out. When I returned, Holmes was still sitting in his chair, with his eyes closed. \"Well,\" said he, as I entered, \"have you sent it off?\" \"Yes,\" said I. \"It is gone.\" \"Very good,\" said he. \"Now we have done all that we can do. We must wait for the result.\" For a long time we sat in silence. At last there was a knock at the door. Holmes started to his feet. \"Come in,\" said he. The door opened, and a police inspector entered. \"Mr. Holmes?\" said he. \"I am Mr. Holmes,\" said my friend. \"I have a telegram for you,\" said the inspector. \"It is from Dundee.\" \"From Dundee!\" exclaimed Holmes. \"What news?\" \"Bad news, I am afraid,\" said the inspector. \"The gentleman whom you telegraphed about was found dead this morning.\" Holmes sank back into his chair. \"Dead!\" he whispered. \"Dead!\" \"Yes,\" said the inspector. \"He was found dead in his bed. There was no mark of violence upon him, but the doctor says that he must have been dead for some hours.\" \"And the cause of death?\" \"The doctor says that it was heart disease.\" \"Heart disease!\" exclaimed Holmes. \"But he was a young man, and in perfect health.\" \"The doctor says that it was heart disease,\" repeated the inspector. \"And there is something else,\" he added. \"There was a paper found in his hand.\" \"A paper!\" \"Yes. It was a piece of paper with five orange pips upon it.\" Holmes groaned. \"The Ku Klux Klan!\" he cried. \"The Ku Klux Klan!\" \"Do you know what that means, Mr. Holmes?\" asked the inspector. \"I think that I do,\" said Holmes. \"It means that the Ku Klux Klan has been at work.\" \"And what is the Ku Klux Klan?\" \"It is a society of terrorists,\" said Holmes. \"It is a society which was formed in the Southern States of America after the Civil",

                "text": "Sherlock Holmes sat for some time in silence, with his head sunk forward and his eyes bent upon the red glow of the fire. Then he lit his pipe, and leaning back in his chair he watched the blue smoke curl up from it. \"I am afraid, Watson,\" said he at last, \"that you will get little credit from this case. I think that you are yourself aware of as much as I am. There is little to be done save to wait for the monthly report from the inspectors of the Dundee police.\" \"And yet the case is, in itself, most instructive,\" remarked I. \"It is as I have often told you, Watson, that when you have eliminated the impossible, whatever remains, however improbable, must be the truth. We may not be able to give the exact date at which the orange pips were placed in the envelope, for the letter was six days on its way, but we can say that they were mailed at Pondicherry upon January 29th, and that the man who mailed them was aboard a sailing ship which was starting for England. And on the 3rd of February we can say that the gentleman who received the letter in London died, and that his death was caused by fright, which we can prove by the evidence of the doctor who saw him. It is a case, Watson, which may well rank with that of the Sign of Four.\" \"You think, then, that the gentleman who has just left us is in danger?\" \"He is, I fancy, in considerable danger. I should say, in very grave danger.\" \"But you say that this is a maritime case. How then can he be in danger?\" \"Because the men who are after him are on shore. The letter was posted in London, and the men are in London. That is why I say that he is in very grave danger.\" \"But surely, Holmes, you have a clue?\" \"You will not, I am sure, be able to find one. There is not a single clue in the whole business. The only thing that we have to go upon is the letter, and that tells us nothing save that the man who wrote it was on a sailing ship which was starting for England.\" \"But the orange pips?\" \"Ah, yes, the orange pips. They are, I think, the most suggestive part of the whole business. They are, you see, five in number, and they were sent in an envelope which was addressed to the gentleman who has just left us. Now, what do you make of that?\" \"I can make nothing of it.\" \"Well, I think that we may take it that the five orange pips are a warning. They are a warning that the man who received them is in danger.\" \"But from whom?\" \"Ah, that is the question. From whom?\" \"And what is the meaning of K.K.K.?\" \"That is, I think, the most important question of all. What is the meaning of K.K.K.?\" Holmes leaned back in his chair and closed his eyes. For a long time he sat in silence, and I did not care to interrupt him. At last he opened his eyes and looked at me. \"Watson,\" said he, \"I believe that I have solved the problem.\" \"You have found out what K.K.K. means?\" \"I think so. I think that it means the Ku Klux Klan.\" \"The Ku Klux Klan!\" I exclaimed. \"But what is that?\" \"It is a society which was formed in the Southern States of America after the Civil War. It was a society of terrorists, and its object was to prevent the negroes from exercising their rights as citizens. It was a very powerful society, and it committed many murders.\" \"But what has that to do with this case?\" \"I think that it has everything to do with this case. I think that the gentleman who has just left us is in danger from the Ku Klux Klan.\" \"But why?\" \"Because his father was a member of the Ku Klux Klan, and he has inherited his father's papers. I think that the Ku Klux Klan wants those papers.\" \"But why should they want them?\" \"Because they are afraid that they may be used as evidence against them.\" \"I see. And you think that they have killed his uncle and his father?\" \"I think it is very probable. You see, the Ku Klux Klan is a very powerful society, and it is not likely to stick at trifles.\" \"And you think that they are now after him?\" \"I think it is very probable. You see, he is the only one left who knows where the papers are.\" \"Then what is to be done?\" \"I think that we should warn him. We should tell him that he is in danger, and that he should take precautions.\" \"But what precautions can he take?\" \"He should, I think, go to the police. He should tell them the whole story, and he should ask for their protection.\" \"But will they believe him?\" \"I think that they will. You see, the story is a very strange one, and it is not likely to have been invented.\" \"And you think that the police will be able to protect him?\" \"I think that they will do their best. But the Ku Klux Klan is a very powerful society, and it is not likely to be easily put down.\" \"Then what do you advise?\" \"I advise that we should go to the police at once. We should tell them the whole story, and we should ask for their protection for the gentleman who has just left us.\" \"Very good,\" said I. \"Let us go at once.\" I rose from my chair, but Holmes did not move. \"I think,\" said he, \"that there is one more thing that we should do.\" \"What is that?\" \"I think that we should send a telegram to the police at Dundee. We should tell them that we have reason to believe that the gentleman who was murdered there was a member of the Ku Klux Klan, and that his death was caused by the Ku Klux Klan.\" \"But why should we do that?\" \"Because it may help them to find the murderers.\" \"I see. Very good. Let us do that at once.\" Holmes rose from his chair and went to the writing-table. He wrote out a telegram and handed it to me. \"Here,\" said he, \"take this to the telegraph office and send it off at once.\" I took the telegram and went out. When I returned, Holmes was still sitting in his chair, with his eyes closed. \"Well,\" said he, as I entered, \"have you sent it off?\" \"Yes,\" said I. \"It is gone.\" \"Very good,\" said he. \"Now we have done all that we can do. We must wait for the result.\" For a long time we sat in silence. At last there was a knock at the door. Holmes started to his feet. \"Come in,\" said he. The door opened, and a police inspector entered. \"Mr. Holmes?\" said he. \"I am Mr. Holmes,\" said my friend. \"I have a telegram for you,\" said the inspector. \"It is from Dundee.\" \"From Dundee!\" exclaimed Holmes. \"What news?\" \"Bad news, I am afraid,\" said the inspector. \"The gentleman whom you telegraphed about was found dead this morning.\" Holmes sank back into his chair. \"Dead!\" he whispered. \"Dead!\" \"Yes,\" said the inspector. \"He was found dead in his bed.

A name derived from the fanciful resemblance to the sound produced by cocking a rifle. This terrible secret society was formed by some ex-Confederate soldiers in the Southern states after the Civil War, and it rapidly formed local branches in different parts of the country, notably in Tennessee, Louisiana, the Carolinas, Georgia, and Florida. Its power was used for political purposes, principally for the terrorising of the negro voters and the murdering and driving from the country of those who were opposed to its views. Its outrages were usually preceded by a warning sent to the marked man in some fantastic but generally recognised shape—a sprig of oak-leaves in some parts, melon seeds or orange pips in others. On receiving this the victim might either openly abjure his former ways, or might fly from the country. If he braved the matter out, death would unfailingly come upon him, and usually in some strange and unforeseen manner. So perfect was the organisation of the society, and so systematic its methods, that there is hardly a case upon record where any man succeeded in braving it with impunity, or in which any of its outrages were traced home to the perpetrators. For some years the organisation flourished in spite of the efforts of the United States government and of the better classes of the community in the South. Eventually, in the year 1869, the movement rather suddenly collapsed, although there have been sporadic outbreaks of the same sort since that date.’\n“You will observe,” said Holmes, laying down the volume, “that the sudden breaking up of the society was coincident with the disappearance of Openshaw from America with their papers. It may well have been cause and effect. It is no wonder that he and his family have some of the more implacable spirits upon their track. You can understand that this register and diary may implicate some of the first men in the South, and that there may be many who will not sleep easy at night until it is recovered.”\n“Then the page we have seen—”\n“Is such as we might expect. It ran, if I remember right, ‘sent the pips to A, B, and C’—that is, sent the society’s warning to them. Then there are successive entries that A and B cleared, or left the country, and finally that C was visited, with, I fear, a sinister result for C. Well, I think, Doctor, that we may let some light into this dark place, and I believe that the only chance young Openshaw has in the meantime is to do what I have told him. There is nothing more to be said or to be done to-night, so hand me over my violin and let us try to forget for half an hour the miserable weather and the still more miserable ways of our fellow men.”",

I asked you to look in the American Encyclopædia under that heading.”\n\nI turned the pages and found the entry. “Ku Klux Klan,” I read aloud. “A name derived from the sound of a rifle cocking. A terrible secret society which sprang up in the Southern States after the Civil War, and which was composed of ruffians, mostly ex-Confederate soldiers, who were banded together for the purpose of terrifying the negro voters and of murdering those who had shown themselves to be either their friends or their leaders. They acted in a most lawless fashion, but always in a way that was calculated to strike the utmost terror into their victims and their opponents. Their outrages were usually preceded by a warning sent to the marked man in some symbolic form. Sometimes a stack of oak leaves in his house, sometimes a melon seed or two, and sometimes five orange pips. Upon receiving this the victim might either recant, or fly, or disregard it. If he disregarded it, death would certainly follow, and usually in some strange and unforeseen manner. So perfect was their organization, and so systematic their methods, that their outrages were seldom traced, and for some years they were the masters of the districts. At last, by the energy of the Government, and the assistance of some of the leading citizens, the society was broken up and became a thing of the past.”\n\nHolmes nodded gravely. “That is the point,” said he. “You will observe that it says that it became a thing of the past in 1869. In that year Colonel Openshaw came to England. There is a distinct coincidence in dates, you observe.”\n\n“As long as he had their papers, they were impotent,” I remarked.\n\n“Precisely. They could not afford to send their agents over to England, and so long as he lived they were safe. But the moment of his death the search began. The papers are, as you observe, of immense importance to them. They are documents of the Ku Klux Klan, and they are undoubtedly such as to incriminate some of the leading men at the South. That is why the Openshaw family have been hunted down the generations, and why the papers are so desperately desired. Now, let us look at the diary again. You see how it all fits in. ‘Sent the pips.’ That was the warning. ‘Cleared.’ That was the man who obeyed the warning and got away. ‘Visited.’ That was the man who stayed, and who met his fate. And now we have the three entries against the unfortunate young man. ‘Sent the pips’ to him, he ‘cleared’ by coming to me, and he will be ‘visited’ as sure as fate if we do not prevent it.”\n\n“Then you think that we can prevent it?”\n\n“We can try. At least, we can throw some light upon the matter. But it is a grim business, and I fear that it may be too late. Openshaw’s only chance is to do exactly what his uncle and father failed to do—to follow the instructions in the papers. But we must not dwell upon it tonight. The weather is grim, and the ways of men are grimmer still. Give me my violin, and let us try to forget that there is such a thing as a Ku Klux Klan.”\n\"\"\"\n```",

The night, however, was extremely dark and stormy, so that, in spite of the help of several passers-by, it was quite impossible to effect a rescue. The alarm, however, was given, and, by the aid of the water-police, the body was eventually recovered. It proved to be that of a young gentleman whose name, as it appears from an envelope which was found in his pocket, was John Openshaw, and whose residence is near Horsham. It is conjectured that he may have been hurrying down to catch the last train from Waterloo Station, and that in his haste and the extreme darkness he missed his path and walked over the edge of one of the small landing-places for river steamboats. The body exhibited no traces of violence, and there can be no doubt that the deceased had been the victim of an unfortunate accident, which should have the effect of calling the attention of the authorities to the condition of the riverside landing-stages.’”\nWe sat in silence for some minutes, Holmes more depressed and shaken than I had ever seen him.\n“That hurts my pride, Watson,” he said at last. “It is a petty feeling, no doubt, but it hurts my pride. It becomes a personal matter with me now, and, if God sends me health, I shall set my hand upon this gang. That he should come to me for help, and that I should send him away to his death—!” He sprang from his chair and paced about the room in uncontrollable agitation, with a flush upon his sallow cheeks and a nervous clasping and unclasping of his long thin hands.\n“They must be cunning devils,” he exclaimed at last. “How could they have decoyed him down there? The Embankment is not on the direct line to the station. The bridge, no doubt, was too crowded, even on such a night, for their purpose. Well, Watson, we shall see who will win in the long run.

Excellent! See the advantage of a trained mind, Watson! Here we have no Openshaw case, but we have a case which may turn out to be something very like it. Let us take the facts in their order. This is the morning paper, is it not?”\n“Yes.”\n“Well, I have not had time to look at it yet. Unfold it, and let us see if there is anything of interest.”\nHe was leisurely picking his way among his eggs and toast, when suddenly his eyes flashed, and he laid down his knife and fork. “Great heavens, Watson, what is this?” he cried. “You are not serious!

I had hoped to have saved him. But I was too late.”\n“You did your best,” I said. “No man could have done more.”\n“Yes, Watson, I could have done more. I should have done more. I should have been there. I should have prevented it. But I was too late.”\nHe rose from his chair, and paced the room with rapid strides. “It is too bad,” he said again. “It is too bad.

But I was too late.”\n“You must not blame yourself,” I said. “It was not your fault.”\n“No, Watson, it was my fault, and mine alone. I should have known. I should have been there. I should have prevented it. But I was too late.”\nHe stopped in front of the fireplace, and stood for a long time with his back to me, his head sunk upon his breast. Then he turned, and I saw that his face was set and stern. “I will do it, Watson,” he said. “I will do it. I will find these men. I will bring them to justice. I will avenge him.”\n“You will?”\n“Yes, Watson, I will. I will not rest until I have found them. I will not rest until I have brought them to justice. I will not rest until I have avenged him.”\n“And how will you do it?”\n“I do not know how I will do it. But I will do it. I will find them. I will bring them to justice. I will avenge him.”\nHe picked up his hat and coat. “I am going out, Watson,” he said. “I am going out to find these men. I am going out to bring them to justice. I am going out to avenge him.”\n“And where are you going?”\n“I am going to the City. I am going to begin my inquiries there.",

                "text": "It had cleared in the morning, and the sun was shining with a subdued brightness through the dim veil which hangs over the great city. Sherlock Holmes was already at breakfast when I came down. “You will excuse me for starting,” he said, “with no Openshaw case to-day, I presume.”\n“The Openshaw case is for a tribunal which will sit upon him in a few months,” I answered. “At the same time I may remark that if my poor friend had not deserted a comfortable English home for the sake of prying into some wretched Irish secrets, his fate would not have overtaken him.”\n“Do you think that?” Holmes said. “Well, of course, it is possible that the mere sight of the papers would not have harmed him, but that his death was due to his own foolhardiness. They are wicked devils, though, and the mere thought of them makes me feel cold all over. It is at the City that I should begin my inquiries, if I were to inquire into this matter of John Openshaw.”\n“And you will?”\n“I don’t know that I shall. I feel a disinclination to dwell upon it. I am too busy. Just look at these three cases at a glance. I was hoping that I should have some good news for you from Openshaw, but I have not got it.”\n“From what you said yesterday, I gathered that you thought yourself upon his track.”\n“So I was. Excellent! See the advantage of a trained mind, Watson! Here we have no Openshaw case, but we have a case which may turn out to be something very like it. Let us take the facts in their order. This is the morning paper, is it not?”\n“Yes.”\n“Well, I have not had time to look at it yet. Unfold it, and let us see if there is anything of interest.”\nHe was leisurely picking his way among his eggs and toast, when suddenly his eyes flashed, and he laid down his knife and fork. “Great heavens, Watson, what is this?” he cried. “You are not serious! It cannot be true!”\n“It is true, though,” I answered, as I glanced at the paper. “It is too true.”\n“Too late, Watson, too late!” he cried, with a voice which I had never heard him use. “If I had but been there—!”\n“It is not your fault,” I said. “It is the fault of the weather, and of the darkness, and of the fact that he was a stranger to the place.”\n“No, no, Watson, it is my fault, and mine alone. I should have known. I should have been there. I should have prevented it. But I was too late. I was too late.”\nHe sank back into his chair, and covered his face with his hands. For a long time he sat in silence, and I could see that he was deeply moved. Then he took his hands from his face, and I saw that his eyes were full of tears. “It is too bad, Watson,” he said. “It is too bad. I had hoped to have done something for him. I had hoped to have saved him. But I was too late.”\n“You did your best,” I said. “No man could have done more.”\n“Yes, Watson, I could have done more. I should have done more. I should have been there. I should have prevented it. But I was too late.”\nHe rose from his chair, and paced the room with rapid strides. “It is too bad,” he said again. “It is too bad. I had hoped to have done something for him. I had hoped to have saved him.

It was nearly ten o’clock before he entered, looking pale and worn. He walked up to the sideboard, and tearing a piece from the loaf he devoured it voraciously, washing it down with a long draught of water.\n“You are hungry,” I remarked.\n“Starving. It had escaped my memory. I have had nothing since breakfast.”\n“Nothing?”\n“Not a bite. I had no time to think of it.”\n“And how have you succeeded?”\n“Well.”\n“You have a clue?”\n“I have them in the hollow of my hand. Young Openshaw shall not long remain unavenged. Why, Watson, let us put their own devilish trade-mark upon them. It is well thought of!”\n“What do you mean?”\nHe took an orange from the cupboard, and tearing it to pieces he squeezed out the pips upon the table. Of these he took five and thrust them into an envelope. On the inside of the flap he wrote “S. H. for J. O.” Then he sealed it and addressed it to “Captain James Calhoun, Barque Lone Star, Savannah, Georgia.”\n“That will await him when he enters port,” said he, chuckling. “It may give him a sleepless night. He will find it as sure a precursor of his fate as Openshaw did before him.”\n“And who is this Captain Calhoun?”\n“The leader of the gang. I shall have the others, but he first.”\n“How did you trace it, then?”\nHe took a large sheet of paper from his pocket, all covered with dates and names.\n“I have spent the whole day,” said he, “over Lloyd’s registers and files of the old papers, following the future career of every vessel which touched at Pondicherry in January and February in ’83. There were thirty-six ships of fair tonnage which were reported there during those months. Of these, one, the Lone Star, instantly attracted my attention, since, although it was reported as having cleared from London, the name is that which is given to one of the states of the Union.”\n“Texas, I think.”\n“I was not and am not sure which; but I knew that the ship must have an American origin.”\n“What then?”\n“I searched the Dundee records, and when I found that the barque Lone Star was there in January, ’85, my suspicion became a certainty. I then inquired as to the vessels which lay at present in the port of London.”\n“Yes?”\n“The Lone Star had arrived here last week. I went down to the Albert Dock and found that she had been taken down the river by the early tide this morning, homeward bound to Savannah. I wired to Gravesend and learned that she had passed some time ago, and as the wind is easterly I have no doubt that she is now past the Goodwins and not very far from the Isle of Wight.”\n“What will you do, then?”\n“Oh, I have my hand upon him. He and the two mates, are as I learn, the only native-born Americans in the ship. The others are Finns and Germans. I know, also, that they were all three away from the ship last night. I had it from the stevedore who has been loading their cargo. By the time that their sailing-ship reaches Savannah the mail-boat will have carried this letter, and the cable will have informed the police of Savannah that these three gentlemen are badly wanted here upon a charge of murder.”",

The gas lamps were already lit, casting long, dancing shadows upon the wet pavement, for a fine, persistent drizzle had set in towards afternoon. I climbed the familiar steps, the sound of my key in the lock a welcome one after the day's labours. As I entered our sitting-room, I found Holmes stretched upon the sofa, a volume of some obscure German monograph on the chemical analysis of tobacco ash lying open upon his chest. The air was thick with the acrid, yet not unpleasant, odour of his favourite shag tobacco, and a thin curl of smoke rose lazily from the Persian slipper he used as a pipe-rack on the mantelpiece. The room, as usual, was a chaotic testament to his peculiar habits – papers strewn everywhere, chemical apparatus bubbling in a corner, and a formidable array of pipes and instruments scattered across tables and chairs. He did not immediately stir, his eyes fixed upon the ceiling in that characteristic pose of intense concentration. I hung up my coat and hat, shaking the moisture from them, and moved towards the fire, which cast a cheerful glow upon the hearth. “A damp evening, Holmes,” I remarked, rubbing my hands together. He gave a slight start, as if returning from a great distance, and lowered the book. “Ah, Watson, you return. I trust your day has been less... sedentary than mine.” He swung his long legs off the sofa and sat up, running a hand through his dark, unruly hair. “I have been wrestling with a rather knotty problem, one that has occupied my thoughts since midday.” He gestured towards a small, plain wooden box that lay upon the table beside him. It was perhaps six inches square, and entirely unremarkable save for a single, crudely carved symbol upon its lid – a circle with a dot in the centre. “This arrived by messenger this morning,” he continued, his eyes gleaming with that peculiar light that always signalled the chase was on. “No note, no address of sender, merely this box and its contents.” He opened the lid, revealing a lining of faded blue velvet. Within lay a single object: a perfectly formed human ear. It was pale and cold, severed cleanly, and bore no marks of violence beyond the cut itself. My medical instincts immediately asserted themselves, and I leaned closer, examining the grisly exhibit. “Good heavens, Holmes! What is the meaning of this?” I exclaimed, recoiling slightly. “That, my dear Watson, is precisely the question that has consumed me,” he replied, picking up the ear with a pair of forceps and turning it gently. “It is, as you observe, a human ear. Male, I should judge, from the size and robustness. The cut is remarkably clean, suggesting a sharp instrument, perhaps a surgical scalpel, though the perpetrator was clearly no surgeon, given the lack of any attempt at haemostasis or care for the victim.” He placed the ear back in the box and closed the lid. “The mystery lies not only in the sender and the victim, but in the utter lack of context. Why send an ear? To whom was it intended? And what does this peculiar symbol signify?” He tapped the lid with a long, lean finger. “I have consulted every work on cryptography and symbology in my collection, and this mark is unknown to me. It is primitive, perhaps tribal, or perhaps a personal cipher. The messenger was a simple lad from the district, who claimed he was paid a shilling by a veiled woman at the corner of Wigmore Street to deliver the box here, with no instructions save to hand it to Mr. Sherlock Holmes.” He leaned back, his gaze distant once more. “A veiled woman, a severed ear, an unknown symbol, and no apparent motive. It has all the hallmarks of a case worthy of our attention, Watson. The game, I fancy, is afoot.” The sudden shift from languid contemplation to keen anticipation was typical of him, and despite the gruesome nature of the object, I felt the familiar thrill of the chase begin to stir within me. The damp evening and my earlier fatigue were forgotten; a new and perplexing puzzle had landed upon our doorstep, and Holmes was already immersed in its depths."

          "text_segment": "Isa Whitney, brother of the late Elias Whitney, D.D., Principal of the Theological College of St. George’s, was much addicted to opium. The habit grew upon him, as I understand, from some foolish freak when he was at college; for having read De Quincey’s description of his dreams and sensations, he had drenched his tobacco with laudanum in an attempt to produce the same effects. He found, as so many more have done, that the practice is easier to attain than to get rid of, and for many years he continued to be a slave to the drug, an object of mingled horror and pity to his friends and relatives. I can see him now, with yellow, pasty face, drooping lids, and pin-point pupils, all huddled in a chair, the wreck and ruin of a noble man.\nOne night—it was in June, ’89—there came a ring to my bell, about the hour when a man gives his first yawn and glances at the clock. I sat up in my chair, and my wife laid her needle-work down in her lap and made a little face of disappointment.\n“A patient!” said she. “You’ll have to go out.”\nI groaned, for I was newly come back from a weary day.\nWe heard the door open, a few hurried words, and then quick steps upon the linoleum. Our own door flew open, and a lady, clad in some dark-coloured stuff, with a black veil, entered the room.\n“You will excuse my calling so late,” she began, and then, suddenly losing her self-control, she ran forward, threw her arms about my wife’s neck, and sobbed upon her shoulder. “Oh, I’m in such trouble!” she cried; “I do so want a little help.”\n“Why,” said my wife, pulling up her veil, “it is Kate Whitney. How you startled me, Kate! I had not an idea who you were when you came in.”\n“I didn’t know what to do, so I came straight to you.” That was always the way. Folk who were in grief came to my wife like birds to a lighthouse.\n“It was very sweet of you to come. Now, you must have some wine and water, and sit here comfortably and tell us all about it. Or should you rather that I sent James off to bed?”\n“Oh, no, no! I want the doctor’s advice and help, too. It’s about Isa. He has not been home for two days. I am so frightened about him!”\nIt was not the first time that she had spoken to us of her husband’s trouble, to me as a doctor, to my wife as an old friend and school companion. We soothed and comforted her by such words as we could find. Did she know where her husband was? Was it possible that we could bring him back to her?\nIt seems that it was. She had the surest information that of late he had, when the fit was on him, made use of an opium den in the farthest east of the City. Hitherto his orgies had always been confined to one day, and he had come back, twitching and shattered, in the evening. But now the spell had been upon him eight-and-forty hours, and he lay there, doubtless among the dregs of the docks, breathing in the poison or sleeping off the effects. There he was to be found, she was sure of it, at the Bar of Gold, in Upper Swandam Lane. But what was she to do? How could she, a young and timid woman, make her way into such a place and pluck her husband out from among the ruffians who surrounded him?\nThere was the case, and of course there was but one way out of it. Might I not escort her to this place? And then, as a second thought, why should she come at all? I was Isa Whitney’s medical adviser, and as such I had influence over him. I could manage it better if I were alone. I promised her on my word that I would send him home in a cab within two hours if he were indeed at the address which she had given me. And so in ten minutes I had left my armchair and cheery sitting-room behind me, and was speeding eastward in a hansom on a strange errand, as it seemed to me at the time, though the future only could show how strange it was to be.",

He had certainly lost caste, but upon the other hand he had gained an experience which might have been of use to him had he been a man strong enough to profit by it. He was young, however, and exceedingly weak, and I fear that he is now past all hope of redemption. Well, it was upon this young man that my attention was fixed one June evening in the year 1889. My door had stood open all day, and it was nearly ten o’clock before my wife reminded me that it was unwise to leave it so. But as I rose to close it, I was arrested by the sight of a tall, thin, womanly figure wrapped in a black veil, who stood hesitating upon the pavement in the lamplight. Her air was that of supreme distress, and her pose that of one who was making a very earnest appeal to my compassion. I was, of course, familiar with the appearance of my patients, and I knew that this was not one of them. I stooped, therefore, to gather up the end of the bandage which had fallen from the wound of my patient, and was about to close the door, when she suddenly stepped forward and pushed it open, throwing back her veil with the action. “Oh, is it you, Mary!” she cried, and, springing into the room, she threw her arms round my wife’s neck and sobbed upon her bosom. I stood surprised at this extraordinary entrance. The lady was young, fashionably dressed, and beautiful. A thick veil had concealed a face of considerable loveliness, though the expression was pained and drawn. She was evidently suffering from some keen sorrow, and her whole nervous system was shaken by it. “My dear Kate,” cried my wife, putting her arm round her, “what is the matter? Sit you down and tell me all about it. You are trembling all over, Kate! What is it?” She sank back into the armchair, and moaned. “I am so glad I have found you, Mary,” she said. “I wanted to ask your advice, and I knew you would befriend me.” “That I will,” she answered. “But what is it, Kate?” “He has left me. He has gone away.” “Who has gone away?” “Isa. My husband. He has been gone for two days.” “Two days!” “Yes, two whole days. I have not heard a word during all that time, and I am so frightened about him.” “Have you searched for him?” “Where should I search? It is at the old place,” she said, with a shudder. “The old place?” “Yes, the opium den in Upper Swandam Lane. I know that is where he goes when he is bad. I have been there myself at the door and begged him to come out. But that was months ago, and I never dared to do it again. But he has been there for two days, and he has never stayed so long before. I am so frightened, Mary. What am I to do? I have no one to turn to, and my heart is breaking.” She wrung her hands in her agony and sobbed in a most pitiable manner. “She has told me all about it,” whispered my wife. “Her husband has been very wild all his life, you know, and has been into the most dreadful places. But this time, poor girl, she really fears that she will lose him for good. Do sit down and give her a word of help and advice.” I sat down beside her and endeavoured to soothe her. “I am so sorry, Mrs. Whitney, to hear of all this. I should imagine that you had cause to be uneasy. This is, I presume, the first time that he has ever gone away for so considerable a period?” “Yes, and the first time that he has ever not let me know where he was. He had left a note to say that he would be away a night, and when he did not come back I became so alarmed that I went to the City Police and to the hospitals, but they knew nothing of him.” “It is most certainly to be feared that he is to be found in the den which you mention,” I said. “And you would like me to go and inquire?” “Yes, yes, doctor! For God’s sake, go and see!” “It is so dreadful that I dare not myself go in,” murmured my companion. “Yet I could not rest until I knew. I will go at once,” I said. “Give me the address.” “Upper Swandam Lane, off the Highway. The Bar of Gold is the name of the place.” “I have heard of it,” I said. “Many times. Do not fear, but I will bring you news either one way or the other. It is possible that he may have overtaken a friend and be spending the time at his house. If he should be at the opium den, I will at least get full particulars about him.” “Do go at once,” she cried. “Oh, do go at once, doctor, before it is too late!” “I shall be back within an hour or two,” I remarked. “Pray compose yourself, and do not hesitate to ask for anything that you may require.” With that I hurried off into the street and called a cab. “To the East End,” I said, and as we drove along my thoughts were solely with my suffering client. I did not know what I should do, what door I should knock at, what inquiries I should make. But my mind was made up that I would find Isa Whitney if he were to be found in the whole of that great wilderness of brick and mortar. I had some vague idea of consulting Sherlock Holmes, but I knew that it was useless to disturb him in his privacy when there was no very definite clue as to what had befallen my friend.

          "text_segment": "But there was no great difficulty in the first stage of my adventure. Upper Swandam Lane is a vile alley lurking behind the high wharves which line the north side of the river to the east of London Bridge. Between a slop-shop and a gin-shop, approached by a steep flight of steps leading down to a black gap like the mouth of a cave, I found the den of which I was in search. Ordering my cab to wait, I passed down the steps, worn hollow in the centre by the ceaseless tread of drunken feet; and by the light of a flickering oil-lamp above the door I found the latch and made my way into a long, low room, thick and heavy with the brown opium smoke, and terraced with wooden berths, like the forecastle of an emigrant ship.\nThrough the gloom one could dimly catch a glimpse of bodies lying in strange fantastic poses, bowed shoulders, bent knees, heads thrown back, and chins pointing upward, with here and there a dark, lack-lustre eye turned upon the newcomer. Out of the black shadows there glimmered little red circles of light, now bright, now faint, as the burning poison waxed or waned in the bowls of the metal pipes. The most lay silent, but some muttered to themselves, and others talked together in a strange, low, monotonous voice, their conversation coming in gushes, and then suddenly tailing off into silence, each mumbling out his own thoughts and paying little heed to the words of his neighbour. At the farther end was a small brazier of burning charcoal, beside which on a three-legged wooden stool there sat a tall, thin old man, with his jaw resting upon his two fists, and his elbows upon his knees, staring into the fire.\nAs I entered, a sallow Malay attendant had hurried up with a pipe for me and a supply of the drug, beckoning me to an empty berth.\n“Thank you. I have not come to stay,” said I. “There is a friend of mine here, Mr. Isa Whitney, and I wish to speak with him.”\nThere was a movement and an exclamation from my right, and peering through the gloom, I saw Whitney, pale, haggard, and unkempt, staring out at me.\n“My God! It’s Watson,” said he. He was in a pitiable state of reaction, with every nerve in a twitter. “I say, Watson, what o’clock is it?”\n“Nearly eleven.”\n“Of what day?”\n“Of Friday, June 19th.”\n“Good heavens! I thought it was Wednesday. It is Wednesday. What d’you want to frighten a chap for?” He sank his face onto his arms and began to sob in a high treble key.\n“I tell you that it is Friday, man. Your wife has been waiting this two days for you. You should be ashamed of yourself!”\n“So I am. But you’ve got mixed, Watson, for I have only been here a few hours, three pipes, four pipes—I forget how many. But I’ll go home with you. I wouldn’t frighten Kate—poor little Kate. Give me your hand! Have you a cab?”\n“Yes, I have one waiting.”\n“Then I shall go in it. But I must owe something. Find what I owe, Watson. I am all off colour. I can do nothing for myself.”\nI walked down the narrow passage between the double row of sleepers, holding my breath to keep out the vile, stupefying fumes of the drug, and looking about for the manager. As I passed the tall man who sat by the brazier I felt a sudden pluck at my skirt, and a low voice whispered, “Walk past me, and then look back at me.” The words fell quite distinctly upon my ear. I glanced down. They could only have come from the old man at my side, and yet he sat now as absorbed as ever, very thin, very wrinkled, bent with age, an opium pipe dangling down from between his knees, as though it had dropped in sheer lassitude from his fingers. I took two steps forward and looked back. It took all my self-control to prevent me from breaking out into a cry of astonishment. He had turned his back so that none could see him but I. His form had filled out, his wrinkles were gone, the dull eyes had regained their fire, and there, sitting by the fire and grinning at my surprise, was none other than Sherlock Holmes. He made a slight motion to me to approach him, and instantly, as he turned his face half round to the company once more, subsided into a doddering, loose-lipped senility.\n“Holmes!” I whispered, “what on earth are you doing in this den?”\n“As low as you can,” he answered; “I have excellent ears. If you would have the great kindness to get rid of that sottish friend of yours I should be exceedingly glad to have a little talk with you.”\n“I have a cab outside.”\n“Then pray send him home in it. You may safely trust him, for he appears to be too limp to get into any mischief. I should recommend you also to send a note by the cabman to your wife to say that you have thrown in your lot with me. If you will wait outside, I shall be with you in five minutes.”",

Upper Swandam Lane is a vile alleyway, reeking of opium and East End vice, the worst dens of London sins. It was a long, narrow slit between high, dingy houses, and its pavements were strewn with yellow paper and decaying cabbage leaves. As I approached the river end, a tall, ill-kept house, with four windows in a row on the upper floor, proclaimed itself, by the illuminated Chinese lanterns which swung upon the filthy passage, to be the headquarters of the business. The blind was down in the front window, and the door was shut, but from the inside came the murmur of voices and the occasional sound of a sharp, metallic click. I tapped at the door, and it was instantly opened by a bent old woman with a brown, wrinkled face. “Opium?” I asked. She nodded and beckoned me in. There was a strong, sickly smell which pervaded the place, and the air was heavy with the fumes of the drug. A dim light burned in the passage, and from the far end came the sound of a low, monotonous drone. I followed the old woman down the passage and into a large, square room, which was filled with a thick, yellow haze. The air was so thick that I could hardly see across the room, and the smell was so strong that it made me feel sick. There were a number of figures lying about on the floor, some of them asleep, others talking in low voices. In the centre of the room was a large charcoal brazier, and beside it sat a tall, thin old man, with a long, white beard, who was stirring the coals with a poker. A young Malay attendant came forward and offered me a pipe. “No,” I said, “I am looking for a friend, Mr. Isa Whitney.” I had hardly spoken the words before a figure rose from the floor and came towards me. It was Isa Whitney, but so changed that I should hardly have known him. His face was pale and drawn, and his eyes were sunken and hollow. He was dressed in a dirty, crumpled suit, and his shirt was open at the neck. He looked like a man who had been ill for weeks. “Watson!” he cried, in a voice that was hoarse and weak. “Is that you, Watson?” “Yes, Isa,” I said. “I have been looking for you everywhere. Your wife is in a terrible state about you.” He passed his hand over his forehead. “My wife?” he said. “I had forgotten all about her. What day is it, Watson?” “It is Friday, May 19th,” I said. “Friday? Impossible! I only came here yesterday.” “No, Isa,” I said. “You came here on Wednesday. You have been here for two days.” He groaned and sank back on the floor. “Two days!” he said. “I thought it was only a few hours. I have lost all count of time.” “Come, Isa,” I said. “You must come home with me. Your wife is waiting for you.” He shook his head. “I can’t, Watson,” he said. “I am too ill. I must stay here until I am better.” “No, Isa,” I said. “You must come now. I will help you.” I put my arm round him and tried to raise him, but he was too weak to stand. “I can’t, Watson,” he said. “I can’t move. I am too ill.” “Very well,” I said. “I will go and find the manager and see if I can get you a room.” I left him lying on the floor and went towards the far end of the room, where the old man was sitting by the brazier. As I passed him, he looked up at me, and I saw that his eyes were bright and intelligent. He was a tall, thin old man, with a long, white beard, and he was dressed in a dirty, crumpled suit. He looked like a man who had been ill for weeks. As I passed him, he put out his hand and touched my arm. “Walk past me,” he whispered, “and then look back.” I walked on a few paces and then turned round. The old man had turned his back to me, and was bending over the brazier. As I looked at him, he slowly turned his head, and I saw that his face was no longer old and wrinkled. The beard had vanished, and the face was full and round. The eyes were bright and sparkling, and the lips were curved in a smile. It was Sherlock Holmes. He winked at me and put his finger to his lips. He then turned back to the brazier and resumed his former attitude. I was so astonished that I could hardly speak. “Holmes!” I whispered. “What are you doing here?” He put his finger to his lips again. “Not a word,” he whispered. “Not a word. Go back to your friend and get him away. I will join you outside in a few minutes.” I went back to Isa Whitney and helped him to his feet. He was still very weak, but he was able to walk with my assistance. I led him out of the room and down the passage. The old woman was still sitting by the door. “He is coming with me,” I said. She nodded and opened the door. I led Isa Whitney out into the street and helped him into the cab. “Take him home,” I said to the driver. “And wait for me here.” I then turned back and went into the house.",

I felt, however, that when Whitney was once confined in the cab my mission was practically accomplished; and for the rest, I could not wish anything better than to be associated with my friend in one of those singular adventures which were the normal condition of his existence. In a few minutes I had written my note, paid Whitney’s bill, led him out to the cab, and seen him driven through the darkness. In a very short time a decrepit figure had emerged from the opium den, and I was walking down the street with Sherlock Holmes. For two streets he shuffled along with a bent back and an uncertain foot. Then, glancing quickly round, he straightened himself out and burst into a hearty fit of laughter.\n“I suppose, Watson,” said he, “that you imagine that I have added opium-smoking to cocaine injections, and all the other little weaknesses on which you have favoured me with your medical views.”\n“I was certainly surprised to find you there.”\n“But not more so than I to find you.”\n“I came to find a friend.”\n“And I to find an enemy.”\n“An enemy?”\n“Yes; one of my natural enemies, or, shall I say, my natural prey. Briefly, Watson, I am in the midst of a very remarkable inquiry, and I have hoped to find a clue in the incoherent ramblings of these sots, as I have done before now. Had I been recognised in that den my life would not have been worth an hour’s purchase; for I have used it before now for my own purposes, and the rascally Lascar who runs it has sworn to have vengeance upon me. There is a trap-door at the back of that building, near the corner of Paul’s Wharf, which could tell some strange tales of what has passed through it upon the moonless nights.”\n“What! You do not mean bodies?”\n“Ay, bodies, Watson. We should be rich men if we had £ 1000 for every poor devil who has been done to death in that den. It is the vilest murder-trap on the whole riverside, and I fear that Neville St. Clair has entered it never to leave it more. But our trap should be here.” He put his two forefingers between his teeth and whistled shrilly—a signal which was answered by a similar whistle from the distance, followed shortly by the rattle of wheels and the clink of horses’ hoofs.\n“Now, Watson,” said Holmes, as a tall dog-cart dashed up through the gloom, throwing out two golden tunnels of yellow light from its side lanterns. “You’ll come with me, won’t you?”\n“If I can be of use.”\n“Oh, a trusty comrade is always of use; and a chronicler still more so. My room at The Cedars is a double-bedded one.”\n“The Cedars?”\n“Yes; that is Mr. St. Clair’s house. I am staying there while I conduct the inquiry.”\n“Where is it, then?”\n“Near Lee, in Kent. We have a seven-mile drive before us.”\n“But I am all in the dark.”\n“Of course you are. You’ll know all about it presently. Jump up here. All right, John; we shall not need you. Here’s half a crown. Look out for me to-morrow, about eleven. Give her her head. So long, then!”\nHe flicked the horse with his whip, and we dashed away through the endless succession of sombre and deserted streets, which widened gradually, until we were flying across a broad balustraded bridge, with the murky river flowing sluggishly beneath us. Beyond lay another dull wilderness of bricks and mortar, its silence broken only by the heavy, regular footfall of the policeman, or the songs and shouts of some belated party of revellers. A dull wrack was drifting slowly across the sky, and a star or two twinkled dimly here and there through the rifts of the clouds. Holmes drove in silence, with his head sunk upon his breast, and the air of a man who is lost in thought, while I sat beside him, curious to learn what this new quest might be which seemed to tax his powers so sorely, and yet afraid to break in upon the current of his thoughts. We had driven several miles, and were beginning to get to the fringe of the belt of suburban villas, when he shook himself, shrugged his shoulders, and lit up his pipe with the air of a man who has satisfied himself that he is acting for the best.\n“You have a grand gift of silence, Watson,” said he. “It makes you quite invaluable as a companion. ’Pon my word, it is a great thing for me to have someone to talk to, for my own thoughts are not over-pleasant. I was wondering what I should say to this dear little woman to-night when she meets me at the door.”\n“You forget that I know nothing about it.”\n“I shall just have time to tell you the facts of the case before we get to Lee. It seems absurdly simple, and yet, somehow I can get nothing to go upon. There’s plenty of thread, no doubt, but I can’t get the end of it into my hand. Now, I’ll state the case clearly and concisely to you, Watson, and maybe you can see a spark where all is dark to me.”\n“Proceed, then.”\n“Some years ago—to be definite, in May, 1884—there came to Lee a gentleman, Neville St. Clair by name, who appeared to have plenty of money. He took a large villa, laid out the grounds very nicely, and lived generally in good style. By degrees he made friends in the neighbourhood, and in 1887 he married the daughter of a local brewer, by whom he now has two children. He had no occupation, but was interested in several companies and went into town as a rule in the morning, returning by the 5:14 from Cannon Street every night. Mr. St. Clair is now thirty-seven years of age, is a man of temperate habits, a good husband, a very affectionate father, and a man who is popular with all who know him. I may add that his whole debts at the present moment, as far as we have been able to ascertain, amount to £ 88 10s., while he has £ 220 standing to his credit in the Capital and Counties Bank. There is no reason, therefore, to think that money troubles have been weighing upon his mind.\n“Last Monday Mr. Neville St. Clair went into town rather earlier than usual, remarking before he started that he had two important commissions to perform, and that he would bring his little boy home a box of bricks. Now, by the merest chance, his wife received a telegram upon this same Monday, very shortly after his departure, to the effect that a small parcel of considerable value which she had been expecting was waiting for her at the offices of the Aberdeen Shipping Company. Now, if you are well up in your London, you will know that the office of the company is in Fresno Street, which branches out of Upper Swandam Lane, where you found me to-night. Mrs. St. Clair had her lunch, started for the City, did some shopping, proceeded to the company’s office, got her packet, and found herself at exactly 4:35 walking through Swandam Lane on her way back to the station. Have you followed me so far?”\n“It is very clear.”\n“If you remember, Monday was an exceedingly hot day, and Mrs. St. Clair walked slowly, glancing about in the hope of seeing a cab, as she did not like the neighbourhood in which she found herself. While she was walking in this way down Swandam Lane, she suddenly heard an ejaculation or cry, and was struck cold to see her husband looking down at her and, as it seemed to her, beckoning to her from a second-floor window. The window was open, and she distinctly saw his face, which she describes as being terribly agitated. He waved his hands frantically to her, and then vanished from the window so suddenly that it seemed to her that he had been plucked back by some irresistible force from behind. One singular point which struck her quick feminine eye was that although he wore some dark coat, such as he had started to town in, he had on neither collar nor necktie.\n“Convinced that something was amiss with him, she rushed down the steps—for the house was none other than the opium den in which you found me to-night—and running through the front room she attempted to ascend the stairs which led to the first floor. At the foot of the stairs, however, she met this Lascar scoundrel of whom I have spoken, who thrust her back and, aided by a Dane, who acts as assistant there, pushed her out into the street. Filled with the most maddening doubts and fears, she rushed down the lane and, by rare good-fortune, met in Fresno Street a number of constables with an inspector, all on their way to their beat. The inspector and two men accompanied her back, and in spite of the continued resistance of the proprietor, they made their way to the room in which Mr. St. Clair had last been seen. There was no sign of him there. In fact, in the whole of that floor there was no one to be found save a crippled wretch of hideous aspect, who, it seems, made his home there. Both he and the Lascar stoutly swore that no one else had been in the front room during the afternoon. So determined was their denial that the inspector was staggered, and had almost come to believe that Mrs. St. Clair had been deluded when, with a cry, she sprang at a small deal box which lay upon the table and tore the lid from it. Out there fell a cascade of children’s bricks. It was the toy which he had promised to bring home.\n“This discovery, and the evident confusion which the cripple showed, made the inspector realise that the matter was serious. The rooms were carefully examined, and results all pointed to an abominable crime. The front room was plainly furnished as a sitting-room and led into a small bedroom, which looked out upon the back of one of the wharves. Between the wharf and the bedroom window is a narrow strip, which is dry at low tide but is covered at high tide with at least four and a half feet of water. The bedroom window was a broad one and opened from below. On examination traces of blood were to be seen upon the windowsill, and several scattered drops were visible upon the wooden floor of the bedroom. Thrust away behind a curtain in the front room were all the clothes of Mr. Neville St. Clair, with the exception of his coat. His boots, his socks, his hat, and his watch—all were there. There were no signs of violence upon any of these garments, and there were no other traces of Mr. Neville St. Clair. Out of the window he must apparently have gone for no other exit could be discovered, and the ominous bloodstains upon the sill gave little promise that he could save himself by swimming, for the tide was at its very highest at the moment of the tragedy.\n“And now as to the villains who seemed to be immediately implicated in the matter. The Lascar was known to be a man of the vilest antecedents, but as, by Mrs. St. Clair’s story, he was known to have been at the foot of the stair within a very few seconds of her husband’s appearance at the window, he could hardly have been more than an accessory to the crime. His defence was one of absolute ignorance, and he protested that he had no knowledge as to the doings of Hugh Boone, his lodger, and that he could not account in any way for the presence of the missing gentleman’s clothes.\n“So much for the Lascar manager. Now for the sinister cripple who lives upon the second floor of the opium den, and who was certainly the last human being whose eyes rested upon Neville St. Clair. His name is Hugh Boone, and his hideous face is one which is familiar to every man who goes much to the City. He is a professional beggar, though in order to avoid the police regulations he pretends to a small trade in wax vestas. Some little distance down Threadneedle Street, upon the left-hand side, there is, as you may have remarked, a small angle in the wall. Here it is that this creature takes his daily seat, cross-legged with his tiny stock of matches on his lap, and as he is a piteous spectacle a small rain of charity descends into the greasy leather cap which lies upon the pavement beside him. I have watched the fellow more than once before ever I thought of making his professional acquaintance, and I have been surprised at the harvest which he has reaped in a short time. His appearance, you see, is so remarkable that no one can pass him without observing him. A shock of orange hair, a pale face disfigured by a horrible scar, which, by its contraction, has turned up the outer edge of his upper lip, a bulldog chin, and a pair of very penetrating dark eyes, which present a singular contrast to the colour of his hair, all mark him out from amid the common crowd of mendicants and so, too, does his wit, for he is ever ready with a reply to any piece of chaff which may be thrown at him by the passers-by. This is the man whom we now learn to have been the lodger at the opium den, and to have been the last man to see the gentleman of whom we are in quest.”\n“But a cripple!” said I. “What could he have done single-handed against a man in the prime of life?”\n“He is a cripple in the sense that he walks with a limp; but in other respects he appears to be a powerful and well-nurtured man. Surely your medical experience would tell you, Watson, that weakness in one limb is often compensated for by exceptional strength in the others.”\n“Pray continue your narrative.”\n“Mrs. St. Clair had fainted at the sight of the blood upon the window, and she was escorted home in a cab by the police, as her presence could be of no help to them in their investigations. Inspector Barton, who had charge of the case, made a very careful examination of the premises, but without finding anything which threw any light upon the matter. One mistake had been made in not arresting Boone instantly, as he was allowed some few minutes during which he might have communicated with his friend the Lascar, but this fault was soon remedied, and he was seized and searched, without anything being found which could incriminate him. There were, it is true, some blood-stains upon his right shirt-sleeve, but he pointed to his ring-finger, which had been cut near the nail, and explained that the bleeding came from there, adding that he had been to the window not long before, and that the stains which had been observed there came doubtless from the same source. He denied strenuously having ever seen Mr. Neville St. Clair and swore that the presence of the clothes in his room was as much a mystery to him as to the police. As to Mrs. St. Clair’s assertion that she had actually seen her husband at the window, he declared that she must have been either mad or dreaming. He was removed, loudly protesting, to the police-station, while the inspector remained upon the premises in the hope that the ebbing tide might afford some fresh clue.\n“And it did, though they hardly found upon the mud-bank what they had feared to find. It was Neville St. Clair’s coat, and not Neville St. Clair, which lay uncovered as the tide receded. And what do you think they found in the pockets?”\n“I cannot imagine.”\n“No, I don’t think you would guess. Every pocket stuffed with pennies and half-pennies—421 pennies and 270 half-pennies. It was no wonder that it had not been swept away by the tide. But a human body is a different matter. There is a fierce eddy between the wharf and the house. It seemed likely enough that the weighted coat had remained when the stripped body had been sucked away into the river.”\n“But I understand that all the other clothes were found in the room. Would the body be dressed in a coat alone?”\n“No, sir, but the facts might be met speciously enough. Suppose that this man Boone had thrust Neville St. Clair through the window, there is no human eye which could have seen the deed. What would he do then? It would of course instantly strike him that he must get rid of the tell-tale garments. He would seize the coat, then, and be in the act of throwing it out, when it would occur to him that it would swim and not sink. He has little time, for he has heard the scuffle downstairs when the wife tried to force her way up, and perhaps he has already heard from his Lascar confederate that the police are hurrying up the street. There is not an instant to be lost. He rushes to some secret hoard, where he has accumulated the fruits of his beggary, and he stuffs all the coins upon which he can lay his hands into the pockets to make sure of the coat’s sinking. He throws it out, and would have done the same with the other garments had not he heard the rush of steps below, and only just had time to close the window when the police appeared.”\n“It certainly sounds feasible.”\n“Well, we will take it as a working hypothesis for want of a better. Boone, as I have told you, was arrested and taken to the station, but it could not be shown that there had ever before been anything against him. He had for years been known as a professional beggar, but his life appeared to have been a very quiet and innocent one. There the matter stands at present, and the questions which have to be solved—what Neville St. Clair was doing in the opium den, what happened to him when there, where is he now, and what Hugh Boone had to do with his disappearance—are all as far from a solution as ever. I confess that I cannot recall any case within my experience which looked at the first glance so simple and yet which presented such difficulties.”",

I felt, as I walked away from the opium den with him, that my commission in the matter of Isa Whitney was finished, and that his strange errand, whatever it might be, had taken the foremost place in my thoughts. I wrote a hasty note to my wife, telling her that she must not expect me for a few days. I paid a bill at the hotel, and I helped Isa Whitney into a cab, directing the driver to the Fulham Road. ‘In a few days I shall be all right, Watson,’ he said, in a querulous voice. ‘I only wish you could have kept me out of that den.’ ‘I wish you had kept yourself out of it,’ I answered, mentally vowing that never again would I cross his threshold. In half an hour I had rejoined Holmes, and we were driving together in a hansom to Waterloo. The train was just starting, and we fairly jumped into a first-class carriage. ‘You see that Waterloo is an exceedingly inconvenient station,’ said Holmes, laughing, as we sank into our seats. ‘When I wrote to you I never thought of it, and yet I perceive that a man who goes from Lower Norwood must come to Waterloo, or else prolong his journey unduly.’ ‘Lower Norwood is in the south, then?’ I remarked. ‘Yes, I thought of that also as we came along. It strikes me that we are making excellent progress.’ ‘You have had a busy day,’ said I. ‘It is only just begun,’ he answered. ‘I am afraid that you will not find it a very restful one. It is possible that a couple of days may be needed. I was very sorry to see you in that den, Watson, and I was still more sorry to see your friend. I should have imagined that his professional duties would have kept him out of such places. Opium is not much used in England now. It is a dreadful drug, and so is cocaine. I am glad for your sake, Watson, that you are an unexcitable man. A little spice of danger makes my life more interesting, I confess.’ ‘But how did you know that I was in the den?’ I asked. ‘I saw you there, of course. I was sitting just behind you, and I heard you speak to the Lascar. I was afraid to make any sign of recognition, however, for fear that my disguise should be penetrated. But you must tell me, Watson, what it was that took you there, and what was your object.

Holmes listened with the deepest attention. ‘It is a very singular case,’ he remarked, when I had finished. ‘It is one of those cases which are common enough, and yet which present some very remarkable features. For example, the man goes into the den, and is never seen again. That is common enough. But the man is a respectable, well-to-do citizen, and he is seen by his wife in the very act of disappearing. That is very remarkable. And the wife is a woman of character and intelligence. That is still more remarkable. And the man is a man of mark, and he has a wife who is a woman of mark. That is most remarkable of all.’ ‘But what do you make of it?’ I asked. ‘I make nothing of it at present. I have not got all the facts. I have only got the facts which you have given me. I must have more facts before I can form an opinion. But I have no doubt that I shall get them. I have no doubt that I shall get them all. I have no doubt that I shall get them very soon.’ ‘But what do you propose to do?’ I asked. ‘I propose to go to Lower Norwood, and to see the wife.

Just as he finished, however, we drove through two scattered villages, where a few lights still glimmered in the windows.\n“We are on the outskirts of Lee,” said my companion. “We have touched on three English counties in our short drive, starting in Middlesex, passing over an angle of Surrey, and ending in Kent. See that light among the trees? That is The Cedars, and beside that lamp sits a woman whose anxious ears have already, I have little doubt, caught the clink of our horse’s feet.”\n“But why are you not conducting the case from Baker Street?” I asked.\n“Because there are many inquiries which must be made out here. Mrs. St. Clair has most kindly put two rooms at my disposal, and you may rest assured that she will have nothing but a welcome for my friend and colleague. I hate to meet her, Watson, when I have no news of her husband. Here we are. Whoa, there, whoa!”\nWe had pulled up in front of a large villa which stood within its own grounds. A stable-boy had run out to the horse’s head, and springing down, I followed Holmes up the small, winding gravel-drive which led to the house. As we approached, the door flew open, and a little blonde woman stood in the opening, clad in some sort of light mousseline de soie, with a touch of fluffy pink chiffon at her neck and wrists. She stood with her figure outlined against the flood of light, one hand upon the door, one half-raised in her eagerness, her body slightly bent, her head and face protruded, with eager eyes and parted lips, a standing question.\n“Well?” she cried, “well?” And then, seeing that there were two of us, she gave a cry of hope which sank into a groan as she saw that my companion shook his head and shrugged his shoulders.\n“No good news?”\n“None.”\n“No bad?”\n“No.”\n“Thank God for that. But come in. You must be weary, for you have had a long day.”\n“This is my friend, Dr. Watson. He has been of most vital use to me in several of my cases, and a lucky chance has made it possible for me to bring him out and associate him with this investigation.”\n“I am delighted to see you,” said she, pressing my hand warmly. “You will, I am sure, forgive anything that may be wanting in our arrangements, when you consider the blow which has come so suddenly upon us.”\n“My dear madam,” said I, “I am an old campaigner, and if I were not I can very well see that no apology is needed. If I can be of any assistance, either to you or to my friend here, I shall be indeed happy.”\n“Now, Mr. Sherlock Holmes,” said the lady as we entered a well-lit dining-room, upon the table of which a cold supper had been laid out, “I should very much like to ask you one or two plain questions, to which I beg that you will give a plain answer.”\n“Certainly, madam.”\n“Do not trouble about my feelings. I am not hysterical, nor given to fainting. I simply wish to hear your real, real opinion.”\n“Upon what point?”\n“In your heart of hearts, do you think that Neville is alive?”\nSherlock Holmes seemed to be embarrassed by the question. “Frankly, now!” she repeated, standing upon the rug and looking keenly down at him as he leaned back in a basket-chair.\n“Frankly, then, madam, I do not.”\n“You think that he is dead?”\n“I do.”\n“Murdered?”\n“I don’t say that. Perhaps.”\n“And on what day did he meet his death?”\n“On Monday.”\n“Then perhaps, Mr. Holmes, you will be good enough to explain how it is that I have received a letter from him to-day.”",

At the little suburban village of Lee, we left the main road and turned down a lane which led to a considerable mansion standing in its own grounds. We passed two lodges with barred gates and a snow-laden drive, curving through sombre evergreens, which led to the house. \"Here we are,\" said Holmes, dismounting. \"'The Cedars,' and all hopes of a peaceful hostelry vanish.

At intervals we passed a village, the lights from the windows shining out into the cold, damp air and casting yellow squares upon the wet road. We knew where we were, however, and Holmes had already pointed out the great elms which marked the position of Mr. St. Clair's house. \"The Cedars\" was an old-fashioned place, with a broad, winding drive leading up to it through a considerable park. There was a lodge at the gate, and a stable-boy was waiting beside it. \"I shall stop here, Watson,\" said Holmes, with a smile. \"I feel that we are coming to close quarters now. You may walk up with me.\" We dismounted, and the lad led the horses away. We walked up the winding drive, with sombre clumps of evergreen upon either side of us. Holmes was silent and grave. He knew what was awaiting him. I saw, by the slight quiver of his lip, the deep concern which he felt. There was a dim light shining from the hall window. As we approached, the door opened, and a small, blonde woman stood in the opening. I saw at a glance that she was in a state of intense expectancy. Her face was pale and drawn, but her eyes were bright and eager. She was elegantly dressed, but her hair was in some disorder. She stood with her head thrown back and her breath held, her whole attitude that of one who is listening intently. As our steps sounded upon the gravel, she ran forward and peered into our faces. \"Mr. Holmes!\" she cried. \"No news?\" \"None,\" said Holmes. \"Oh, Mr. Holmes, you have not been able to find him?\" \"Not yet.\" \"But you have hopes?\" \"I have hopes.\" She seemed to be about to speak again, but she stopped, and her face fell. \"Ah,\" she cried, \"I see that you have no good news. Your face tells me so. But you have not bad news? He is not dead?\" \"No, no, my dear madam. I have no proof of death.\" \"Thank God! Thank God!\" She seemed about to faint, but she held herself up by an effort. \"Come in, Mr. Holmes. Come in, sir,\" and she held out her hand to me. \"This is my friend, Dr. Watson,\" said Holmes. \"He has been of great assistance to me in this matter.\" \"You are very welcome, sir,\" said she, cordially. \"You will excuse anything that may be wanting. We are in a state of great confusion, as you may imagine.\" \"It is impossible for me to say how glad I am to see you,\" said I. \"I have heard so much of the case.\" \"I am sure that you will do all that you can for me,\" she said. \"I am sure that you will find my husband. Come in, and let me give you something to eat. You have had a long day.\" We entered the house and passed into a dining-room, where a cold supper was laid out upon the table. She sat down and motioned us to our places. \"Do not trouble about me,\" she said. \"I can eat nothing. But you must be hungry. Mr. Holmes,\" she continued, raising her eyes to his face, \"I want you to be perfectly frank with me. I know that you are a man who is not afraid to speak the truth. Tell me, then, I beg you, what is in your heart. Do you believe that my husband is alive?\" Holmes hesitated for a moment. \"No, madam,\" said he, \"I do not.\" \"Then you are sure that he is dead?\" \"I fear that it is so.\" \"And that he was murdered?\" \"I fear that it was so.\" \"Upon Monday?\" \"Yes, I",
                "refinement_prompt": "IMPROVEMENT GUIDANCE:\n1. MAJOR STRUCTURAL ISSUES:\n- The completion omits the transitional scene of passing through two villages with illuminated windows before arriving at the destination. \n- The sequence of events upon arrival is altered: the original features a stable-boy attending to the horse and Watson following Holmes up a winding drive, while the completion introduces a butler and omits the stable-boy entirely.\n- The original includes a detailed description of the woman’s appearance and posture at the door, which is replaced in the completion by a more general and less vivid description.\n- The original contains a formal introduction of Watson to Mrs. St. Clair and her warm greeting, which is missing in the completion.\n- The original includes a scene in a dining-room with a cold supper laid out, and the woman’s request for direct answers, which is not present in the completion.\n\n2. MISSING ELEMENTS:\n- The completion lacks the mention of the three counties traversed during the drive and the specific reference to the light among the trees indicating their destination.\n- The emotional exchange where Mrs. St. Clair’s hope turns to despair upon seeing Holmes’s reaction is not fully depicted.\n- The original’s dialogue about Watson’s role and Mrs. St. Clair’s apology for the state of the household is omitted.\n- The woman’s explicit request for plain answers and her assertion of emotional strength are not included.\n- The original’s step-by-step questioning about the fate of her husband, including the specific day, is condensed or altered.\n\n3. INACCURATE ELEMENTS:\n- The completion introduces invented details such as passing two lodges with barred gates and a snow-laden drive, which are not present in the original.\n- The butler’s presence and the woman’s immediate physical contact with Holmes are inventions not found in the original.\n- The completion attributes different emotional tones and dialogue to the characters, such as Mrs. St. Clair’s comments about Holmes’s weariness and emotional state, which do not match the original.\n- The sequence and content of the questioning about Mr. St. Clair’s fate are altered, with some questions and answers either missing or rephrased inaccurately.\n- The timing of the presumed death is stated differently, and the completion introduces the idea of \"Monday night\" rather than the original’s phrasing.\n- The final revelation about the letter is presented with a different emotional tone and structure than in the original."

          "text_segment": "Sherlock Holmes sprang out of his chair as if he had been galvanised.\n“What!” he roared.\n“Yes, to-day.” She stood smiling, holding up a little slip of paper in the air.\n“May I see it?”\n“Certainly.”\nHe snatched it from her in his eagerness, and smoothing it out upon the table he drew over the lamp and examined it intently. I had left my chair and was gazing at it over his shoulder. The envelope was a very coarse one and was stamped with the Gravesend postmark and with the date of that very day, or rather of the day before, for it was considerably after midnight.\n“Coarse writing,” murmured Holmes. “Surely this is not your husband’s writing, madam.”\n“No, but the enclosure is.”\n“I perceive also that whoever addressed the envelope had to go and inquire as to the address.”\n“How can you tell that?”\n“The name, you see, is in perfectly black ink, which has dried itself. The rest is of the greyish colour, which shows that blotting-paper has been used. If it had been written straight off, and then blotted, none would be of a deep black shade. This man has written the name, and there has then been a pause before he wrote the address, which can only mean that he was not familiar with it. It is, of course, a trifle, but there is nothing so important as trifles. Let us now see the letter. Ha! there has been an enclosure here!”\n“Yes, there was a ring. His signet-ring.”\n“And you are sure that this is your husband’s hand?”\n“One of his hands.”\n“One?”\n“His hand when he wrote hurriedly. It is very unlike his usual writing, and yet I know it well.”\n“‘Dearest do not be frightened. All will come well. There is a huge error which it may take some little time to rectify. Wait in patience.—NEVILLE.’ Written in pencil upon the fly-leaf of a book, octavo size, no water-mark. Hum! Posted to-day in Gravesend by a man with a dirty thumb. Ha! And the flap has been gummed, if I am not very much in error, by a person who had been chewing tobacco. And you have no doubt that it is your husband’s hand, madam?”\n“None. Neville wrote those words.”\n“And they were posted to-day at Gravesend. Well, Mrs. St. Clair, the clouds lighten, though I should not venture to say that the danger is over.”\n“But he must be alive, Mr. Holmes.”\n“Unless this is a clever forgery to put us on the wrong scent. The ring, after all, proves nothing. It may have been taken from him.”\n“No, no; it is, it is his very own writing!”\n“Very well. It may, however, have been written on Monday and only posted to-day.”\n“That is possible.”\n“If so, much may have happened between.”\n“Oh, you must not discourage me, Mr. Holmes. I know that all is well with him. There is so keen a sympathy between us that I should know if evil came upon him. On the very day that I saw him last he cut himself in the bedroom, and yet I in the dining-room rushed upstairs instantly with the utmost certainty that something had happened. Do you think that I would respond to such a trifle and yet be ignorant of his death?”\n“I have seen too much not to know that the impression of a woman may be more valuable than the conclusion of an analytical reasoner. And in this letter you certainly have a very strong piece of evidence to corroborate your view. But if your husband is alive and able to write letters, why should he remain away from you?”\n“I cannot imagine. It is unthinkable.”\n“And on Monday he made no remarks before leaving you?”\n“No.”\n“And you were surprised to see him in Swandam Lane?”\n“Very much so.”\n“Was the window open?”\n“Yes.”\n“Then he might have called to you?”\n“He might.”\n“He only, as I understand, gave an inarticulate cry?”\n“Yes.”\n“A call for help, you thought?”\n“Yes. He waved his hands.”\n“But it might have been a cry of surprise. Astonishment at the unexpected sight of you might cause him to throw up his hands?”\n“It is possible.”\n“And you thought he was pulled back?”\n“He disappeared so suddenly.”\n“He might have leaped back. You did not see anyone else in the room?”\n“No, but this horrible man confessed to having been there, and the Lascar was at the foot of the stairs.”\n“Quite so. Your husband, as far as you could see, had his ordinary clothes on?”\n“But without his collar or tie. I distinctly saw his bare throat.”\n“Had he ever spoken of Swandam Lane?”\n“Never.”\n“Had he ever showed any signs of having taken opium?”\n“Never.”\n“Thank you, Mrs. St. Clair. Those are the principal points about which I wished to be absolutely clear. We shall now have a little supper and then retire, for we may have a very busy day to-morrow.”\nA large and comfortable double-bedded room had been placed at our disposal, and I was quickly between the sheets, for I was weary after my night of adventure. Sherlock Holmes was a man, however, who, when he had an unsolved problem upon his mind, would go for days, and even for a week, without rest, turning it over, rearranging his facts, looking at it from every point of view until he had either fathomed it or convinced himself that his data were insufficient. It was soon evident to me that he was now preparing for an all-night sitting. He took off his coat and waistcoat, put on a large blue dressing-gown, and then wandered about the room collecting pillows from his bed and cushions from the sofa and armchairs. With these he constructed a sort of Eastern divan, upon which he perched himself cross-legged, with an ounce of shag tobacco and a box of matches laid out in front of him. In the dim light of the lamp I saw him sitting there, an old briar pipe between his lips, his eyes fixed vacantly upon the corner of the ceiling, the blue smoke curling up from him, silent, motionless, with the light shining upon his strong-set aquiline features. So he sat as I dropped off to sleep, and so he sat when a sudden ejaculation caused me to wake up, and I found the summer sun shining into the apartment.",

            "prefix-probing": "Sherlock Holmes sprang out of his chair as if he had been galvanised. His long, lean figure, usually so languid and relaxed when not actively engaged, was suddenly rigid with an intense energy that seemed to crackle about him. His eyes, which had been half-closed in thought, were now wide and gleaming with a fierce light. He snatched up a magnifying glass from the table, not to examine anything, but as if it were a conductor for his sudden surge of mental power. I had been sitting opposite him, reading the morning paper, quite accustomed to his fits of abstraction, but this was different. This was not mere thought; it was revelation. It was the sudden, blinding flash of insight that illuminated the darkest corners of a problem. I laid down my paper, my own pulse quickening in response to his sudden animation. “Holmes!” I exclaimed, “What is it? Have you got it?” He did not immediately answer, his gaze fixed on some point in the middle distance, his brow furrowed in concentration, yet with that peculiar look of triumph that I knew so well. He paced the length of the room twice, his hands clasped behind his back, his head bent. Then, he stopped abruptly by the window, looking out at the grey London street, though I doubted he saw anything but the intricate workings of his own mind. “Got it, Watson?” he murmured, more to himself than to me. “My dear fellow, I have not merely got it; I have it by the throat! The entire miserable business, which seemed so tangled and impenetrable, is now as clear as the Serpentine on a summer’s day.” He turned back to me, his face alight with intellectual fervour. “The key, Watson, the absolute, undeniable key, was not in the size of the dog, nor in the time of the train, nor even in the peculiar stain on the carpet. It was in the silence.” I stared at him, bewildered. We had been discussing the case of Mr. Josiah Amberley, the retired tobacconist from Camberwell, whose valuable collection of antique coins had vanished from his locked strong-room. The police were baffled, convinced it was an inside job, perhaps by the new manservant, though there was not a shred of evidence against the poor fellow. Amberley himself was a picture of distress, a small, fussy man with a perpetual tremor in his hands, who seemed utterly incapable of concocting such a scheme. The strong-room had been locked from the inside, the key found in Amberley’s own pocket. There were no signs of forced entry, no hidden passages, nothing. It was a perfect, impossible crime. And Holmes spoke of silence. “Silence, Holmes?” I repeated, feeling utterly at sea. “What silence?” “The silence of the dog, Watson,” he said, his voice dropping slightly, becoming more intense. “The dog that did not bark in the night.” I felt a prickle of understanding, a faint glimmer of the path his mind was taking. “But there was no dog involved in the Amberley case,” I protested. “Amberley keeps no dog.” “Precisely!” Holmes exclaimed, snapping his fingers. “That is the beauty of it! The dog that was *not* there, and therefore could *not* bark. Think, Watson, think! We were told that Mr. Amberley retired to bed at eleven o’clock, leaving his strong-room, containing coins worth some seven thousand pounds, securely locked. His wife was visiting her sister in the country. The manservant slept in the attic. Mr. Amberley himself slept soundly until seven the next morning, when he discovered the loss. The strong-room door was still locked from the inside, the key under his pillow. The window was latched from within. The chimney was too narrow for a child, let alone a man. It was as if the coins had simply dematerialised.” He paused, allowing the impossibility of the scenario to sink in. “The police, bless their earnest hearts, focused on the physical impossibility. How did the thief get in? How did he get out? How did he lock the door from the inside? They were looking for a physical solution to what appeared to be a physical problem. But the solution, Watson, is not physical at all. It is psychological. Or rather, it lies in the absence of a psychological reaction.” He began to pace again, but this time with a lighter, more energetic step. “Consider the facts we were given. A valuable treasure is stolen from a house in the dead of night. The owner is asleep upstairs. There is a manservant also in the house. In ninety-nine cases out of a hundred, such a house would possess a dog. A dog, Watson, is the natural guardian of a dwelling. Its senses are keener than a man’s, its loyalty absolute, its bark a loud alarm. If a stranger had entered that house in the night, a dog would surely have raised the alarm. The household would have been roused. The thief would have been discovered, or at least disturbed.” He stopped and fixed me with his penetrating gaze. “But in this case, there was no alarm. Mr. Amberley slept soundly. The manservant slept soundly. The house remained silent throughout the night. Why? Because there was no dog to bark. And why was there no dog to bark? Because the person who entered the house was not a stranger.” The pieces began to fall into place in my mind, clicking together with the satisfying precision of a well-made lock. “You mean,” I breathed, “that the thief was someone known to the household? Someone the dog would not bark at?” “Precisely, Watson! But as you correctly pointed out, there was no dog! So the absence of the bark tells us not that the thief was known to a dog, but that the thief was known to the *house*. Known in such"

          "text_segment": "The pipe was still between his lips, the smoke still curled upward, and the room was full of a dense tobacco haze, but nothing remained of the heap of shag which I had seen upon the previous night.\n“Awake, Watson?” he asked.\n“Yes.”\n“Game for a morning drive?”\n“Certainly.”\n“Then dress. No one is stirring yet, but I know where the stable-boy sleeps, and we shall soon have the trap out.” He chuckled to himself as he spoke, his eyes twinkled, and he seemed a different man to the sombre thinker of the previous night.\nAs I dressed I glanced at my watch. It was no wonder that no one was stirring. It was twenty-five minutes past four. I had hardly finished when Holmes returned with the news that the boy was putting in the horse.\n“I want to test a little theory of mine,” said he, pulling on his boots. “I think, Watson, that you are now standing in the presence of one of the most absolute fools in Europe. I deserve to be kicked from here to Charing Cross. But I think I have the key of the affair now.”\n“And where is it?” I asked, smiling.\n“In the bathroom,” he answered. “Oh, yes, I am not joking,” he continued, seeing my look of incredulity. “I have just been there, and I have taken it out, and I have got it in this Gladstone bag. Come on, my boy, and we shall see whether it will not fit the lock.”\nWe made our way downstairs as quietly as possible, and out into the bright morning sunshine. In the road stood our horse and trap, with the half-clad stable-boy waiting at the head. We both sprang in, and away we dashed down the London Road. A few country carts were stirring, bearing in vegetables to the metropolis, but the lines of villas on either side were as silent and lifeless as some city in a dream.\n“It has been in some points a singular case,” said Holmes, flicking the horse on into a gallop. “I confess that I have been as blind as a mole, but it is better to learn wisdom late than never to learn it at all.”\nIn town the earliest risers were just beginning to look sleepily from their windows as we drove through the streets of the Surrey side. Passing down the Waterloo Bridge Road we crossed over the river, and dashing up Wellington Street wheeled sharply to the right and found ourselves in Bow Street. Sherlock Holmes was well known to the force, and the two constables at the door saluted him. One of them held the horse’s head while the other led us in.\n“Who is on duty?” asked Holmes.\n“Inspector Bradstreet, sir.”\n“Ah, Bradstreet, how are you?” A tall, stout official had come down the stone-flagged passage, in a peaked cap and frogged jacket. “I wish to have a quiet word with you, Bradstreet.”\n“Certainly, Mr. Holmes. Step into my room here.”\nIt was a small, office-like room, with a huge ledger upon the table, and a telephone projecting from the wall. The inspector sat down at his desk.\n“What can I do for you, Mr. Holmes?”\n“I called about that beggarman, Boone—the one who was charged with being concerned in the disappearance of Mr. Neville St. Clair, of Lee.”\n“Yes. He was brought up and remanded for further inquiries.”\n“So I heard. You have him here?”\n“In the cells.”\n“Is he quiet?”\n“Oh, he gives no trouble. But he is a dirty scoundrel.”\n“Dirty?”\n“Yes, it is all we can do to make him wash his hands, and his face is as black as a tinker’s. Well, when once his case has been settled, he will have a regular prison bath; and I think, if you saw him, you would agree with me that he needed it.”\n“I should like to see him very much.”\n“Would you? That is easily done. Come this way. You can leave your bag.”\n“No, I think that I’ll take it.”\n“Very good. Come this way, if you please.” He led us down a passage, opened a barred door, passed down a winding stair, and brought us to a whitewashed corridor with a line of doors on each side.\n“The third on the right is his,” said the inspector. “Here it is!” He quietly shot back a panel in the upper part of the door and glanced through.\n“He is asleep,” said he. “You can see him very well.”\nWe both put our eyes to the grating. The prisoner lay with his face towards us, in a very deep sleep, breathing slowly and heavily. He was a middle-sized man, coarsely clad as became his calling, with a coloured shirt protruding through the rent in his tattered coat. He was, as the inspector had said, extremely dirty, but the grime which covered his face could not conceal its repulsive ugliness. A broad wheal from an old scar ran right across it from eye to chin, and by its contraction had turned up one side of the upper lip, so that three teeth were exposed in a perpetual snarl. A shock of very bright red hair grew low over his eyes and forehead.\n“He’s a beauty, isn’t he?” said the inspector.\n“He certainly needs a wash,” remarked Holmes. “I had an idea that he might, and I took the liberty of bringing the tools with me.” He opened the Gladstone bag as he spoke, and took out, to my astonishment, a very large bath-sponge.\n“He! he! You are a funny one,” chuckled the inspector.\n“Now, if you will have the great goodness to open that door very quietly, we will soon make him cut a much more respectable figure.”\n“Well, I don’t know why not,” said the inspector. “He doesn’t look a credit to the Bow Street cells, does he?” He slipped his key into the lock, and we all very quietly entered the cell. The sleeper half turned, and then settled down once more into a deep slumber. Holmes stooped to the water-jug, moistened his sponge, and then rubbed it twice vigorously across and down the prisoner’s face.\n“Let me introduce you,” he shouted, “to Mr. Neville St. Clair, of Lee, in the county of Kent.”\nNever in my life have I seen such a sight. The man’s face peeled off under the sponge like the bark from a tree. Gone was the coarse brown tint! Gone, too, was the horrid scar which had seamed it across, and the twisted lip which had given the repulsive sneer to the face! A twitch brought away the tangled red hair, and there, sitting up in his bed, was a pale, sad-faced, refined-looking man, black-haired and smooth-skinned, rubbing his eyes and staring about him with sleepy bewilderment. Then suddenly realising the exposure, he broke into a scream and threw himself down with his face to the pillow.\n“Great heavens!” cried the inspector, “it is, indeed, the missing man. I know him from the photograph.”\nThe prisoner turned with the reckless air of a man who abandons himself to his destiny. “Be it so,” said he. “And pray what am I charged with?”\n“With making away with Mr. Neville St.— Oh, come, you can’t be charged with that unless they make a case of attempted suicide of it,” said the inspector with a grin. “Well, I have been twenty-seven years in the force, but this really takes the cake.”\n“If I am Mr. Neville St. Clair, then it is obvious that no crime has been committed, and that, therefore, I am illegally detained.”\n“No crime, but a very great error has been committed,” said Holmes. “You would have done better to have trusted your wife.”\n“It was not the wife; it was the children,” groaned the prisoner. “God help me, I would not have them ashamed of their father. My God! What an exposure! What can I do?”\nSherlock Holmes sat down beside him on the couch and patted him kindly on the shoulder.\n“If you leave it to a court of law to clear the matter up,” said he, “of course you can hardly avoid publicity. On the other hand, if you convince the police authorities that there is no possible case against you, I do not know that there is any reason that the details should find their way into the papers. Inspector Bradstreet would, I am sure, make notes upon anything which you might tell us and submit it to the proper authorities. The case would then never go into court at all.”\n“God bless you!” cried the prisoner passionately. “I would have endured imprisonment, ay, even execution, rather than have left my miserable secret as a family blot to my children.\n“You are the first who have ever heard my story. My father was a schoolmaster in Chesterfield, where I received an excellent education. I travelled in my youth, took to the stage, and finally became a reporter on an evening paper in London. One day my editor wished to have a series of articles upon begging in the metropolis, and I volunteered to supply them. There was the point from which all my adventures started. It was only by trying begging as an amateur that I could get the facts upon which to base my articles. When an actor I had, of course, learned all the secrets of making up, and had been famous in the green-room for my skill. I took advantage now of my attainments. I painted my face, and to make myself as pitiable as possible I made a good scar and fixed one side of my lip in a twist by the aid of a small slip of flesh-coloured plaster. Then with a red head of hair, and an appropriate dress, I took my station in the business part of the city, ostensibly as a match-seller but really as a beggar. For seven hours I plied my trade, and when I returned home in the evening I found to my surprise that I had received no less than 26s. 4d.\n“I wrote my articles and thought little more of the matter until, some time later, I backed a bill for a friend and had a writ served upon me for £ 25. I was at my wit’s end where to get the money, but a sudden idea came to me. I begged a fortnight’s grace from the creditor, asked for a holiday from my employers, and spent the time in begging in the City under my disguise. In ten days I had the money and had paid the debt.\n“Well, you can imagine how hard it was to settle down to arduous work at £ 2 a week when I knew that I could earn as much in a day by smearing my face with a little paint, laying my cap on the ground, and sitting still. It was a long fight between my pride and the money, but the dollars won at last, and I threw up reporting and sat day after day in the corner which I had first chosen, inspiring pity by my ghastly face and filling my pockets with coppers. Only one man knew my secret. He was the keeper of a low den in which I used to lodge in Swandam Lane, where I could every morning emerge as a squalid beggar and in the evenings transform myself into a well-dressed man about town. This fellow, a Lascar, was well paid by me for his rooms, so that I knew that my secret was safe in his possession.\n“Well, very soon I found that I was saving considerable sums of money. I do not mean that any beggar in the streets of London could earn £ 700 a year—which is less than my average takings—but I had exceptional advantages in my power of making up, and also in a facility of repartee, which improved by practice and made me quite a recognised character in the City. All day a stream of pennies, varied by silver, poured in upon me, and it was a very bad day in which I failed to take £ 2.\n“As I grew richer I grew more ambitious, took a house in the country, and eventually married, without anyone having a suspicion as to my real occupation. My dear wife knew that I had business in the City. She little knew what.\n“Last Monday I had finished for the day and was dressing in my room above the opium den when I looked out of my window and saw, to my horror and astonishment, that my wife was standing in the street, with her eyes fixed full upon me. I gave a cry of surprise, threw up my arms to cover my face, and, rushing to my confidant, the Lascar, entreated him to prevent anyone from coming up to me. I heard her voice downstairs, but I knew that she could not ascend. Swiftly I threw off my clothes, pulled on those of a beggar, and put on my pigments and wig. Even a wife’s eyes could not pierce so complete a disguise. But then it occurred to me that there might be a search in the room, and that the clothes might betray me. I threw open the window, reopening by my violence a small cut which I had inflicted upon myself in the bedroom that morning. Then I seized my coat, which was weighted by the coppers which I had just transferred to it from the leather bag in which I carried my takings. I hurled it out of the window, and it disappeared into the Thames. The other clothes would have followed, but at that moment there was a rush of constables up the stair, and a few minutes after I found, rather, I confess, to my relief, that instead of being identified as Mr. Neville St. Clair, I was arrested as his murderer.\n“I do not know that there is anything else for me to explain. I was determined to preserve my disguise as long as possible, and hence my preference for a dirty face. Knowing that my wife would be terribly anxious, I slipped off my ring and confided it to the Lascar at a moment when no constable was watching me, together with a hurried scrawl, telling her that she had no cause to fear.”\n“That note only reached her yesterday,” said Holmes.\n“Good God! What a week she must have spent!”\n“The police have watched this Lascar,” said Inspector Bradstreet, “and I can quite understand that he might find it difficult to post a letter unobserved. Probably he handed it to some sailor customer of his, who forgot all about it for some days.”\n“That was it,” said Holmes, nodding approvingly; “I have no doubt of it. But have you never been prosecuted for begging?”\n“Many times; but what was a fine to me?”\n“It must stop here, however,” said Bradstreet. “If the police are to hush this thing up, there must be no more of Hugh Boone.”\n“I have sworn it by the most solemn oaths which a man can take.”\n“In that case I think that it is probable that no further steps may be taken. But if you are found again, then all must come out. I am sure, Mr. Holmes, that we are very much indebted to you for having cleared the matter up. I wish I knew how you reach your results.”\n“I reached this one,” said my friend, “by sitting upon five pillows and consuming an ounce of shag. I think, Watson, that if we drive to Baker Street we shall just be in time for breakfast.”",

In the armchair sat a perfectly motionless and silent figure, the gloom and the smoke making it impossible to distinguish the features. At the gentle sound of my stirring, he turned his head. “Are you awake, Watson?” he asked. “A little after four, morning call, you know.” “My dear fellow, was there ever such a sleepless demon? When do you propose to go to bed?” “I rather think that I shall not go to bed at all.” “But this is incredible! Look at the light of day! It is streaming into the room.” “It is indeed. And a very pretty sight too. What do you think of, Watson? If it were not disagreeable to you to do so, I should take it as a great kindness if you would dress yourself at once and come out with me.” I was still but half awake, but I rose at once and began to dress. It was certainly a strange request at so early an hour. “But where are we going to then?” I asked as I struggled with my clothes. “To the country.” “To the country in the dark?” “No, it is not dark now.” “It is pitch dark.” “Look out of the window.” I did so, and must confess that I was astonished. A greyish light was breaking in the east, and the lamps in the street appeared dull and yellow in comparison to the dawning day. “Dear me!” I said. “I had no idea that it was so late.” “Not at all. I think that you will find it is the earliest start that you have ever made, Watson. It is only 4:25.” “Why, man, it is pitch dark.” “It was when I spoke to you just now. Look again.” I repeated my experience, and looked again. Yes, the dawn was breaking, and the grey light was stealing into the room. “You are right,” I said. “It is a lovely morning.” “And a lovely drive,” he answered. “Are you ready?” “Quite ready.” “Then come along. We shall not be long in getting a trap at the mews, and I know where the stable-boy sleeps. It is a little early, but I have no doubt that we shall be able to manage it.” We went downstairs together, and Holmes led the way into the street. We were not long in finding a cab, and in a few minutes we were rattling through the silent streets of London. It was a lovely morning, and the air was crisp and cold. Holmes was in high spirits, and he talked and laughed as we drove along. “I have been an absolute fool, Watson,” he said. “I have been blind, blind, blind.” “But you have solved the case?” “Yes, I have solved the case. I have the key.” “Where is it?” “In the bathroom.” “In the bathroom?” “Yes, I found it there. I have it in my Gladstone bag.” I looked at him in astonishment. “But what is it?” I asked. “You shall see,” he answered. “It is better to learn late than never, Watson.

If it were not disagreeable to you to do so, I should take it as a great kindness if you would dress yourself at once and come out with me.” I was still but half awake, but I rose at once and began to dress. It was certainly a strange request at so early an hour. “But where are we going to then?” I asked as I struggled with my clothes. “To the country.” “To the country in the dark?” “No, it is not dark now.” “It is pitch dark.” “Look out of the window.” I did so, and must confess that I was astonished. A greyish light was breaking in the east, and the lamps in the street appeared dull and yellow in comparison to the dawning day. “Dear me!” I said. “I had no idea that it was so late.” “Not at all. I think that you will find it is the earliest start that you have ever made, Watson. It is only 4:25.” “Why, man, it is pitch dark.” “It was when I spoke to you just now. Look again.” I repeated my experience, and looked again. Yes, the dawn was breaking, and the grey light was stealing into the room. “You are right,” I said. “It is a lovely morning.” “And a lovely drive,” he answered. “Are you ready?” “Quite ready.” “Then come along. We shall not be long in getting a trap at the mews, and I know where the stable-boy sleeps. It is a little early, but I have no doubt that we shall be able to manage it.” We went downstairs together, and Holmes led the way into the street. We were not long in finding a cab, and in a few minutes we were rattling through the silent streets of London. It was a lovely morning, and the air was crisp and cold. Holmes was in high spirits, and he talked and laughed as we drove along. “I have been an absolute fool, Watson,” he said. “I have been blind, blind, blind.” “But you have solved the case?” “Yes, I have solved the case. I have the key.” “Where is it?” “In the bathroom.” “In the bathroom?” “Yes, I found it there. I have it in my Gladstone bag.” I looked at him in astonishment. “But what is it?” I asked. “You shall see,” he answered. “It is better to learn late than never, Watson. I have been a fool.” We drove swiftly through the silent streets, and soon we were out of London and in the country. The sun was rising, and the fields were bathed in a golden light. It was a beautiful sight. Holmes was still in high spirits, and he talked and laughed as we drove along. “This is a singular case, Watson,” he said. “A very singular case.” “But you have solved it?” “Yes, I have solved it. I have the key.” “Where is it?” “In the bathroom.” “In the bathroom?” “Yes, I found it there. I have it in my Gladstone bag.” I looked at him in astonishment. “But what is it?” I asked. “You shall see,” he answered. “It is better to learn late than never, Watson.

            "prefix-probing": "The pipe was still between his lips, the smoke still curled upward, and the room was full of a dense tobacco haze, but nothing remained of the heap of shag which I had seen upon the previous night. He was leaning back in his arm-chair, with his dressing-gown wrapped around him, and his eyes fixed upon the corner of the ceiling, as though he would read an inscription there. “Good morning,” said he, as I entered. “You don’t seem a particularly happy man to-day,” I remarked. “Oh, you are here!” he cried, with a pleasant smile. “I hardly saw you, my dear fellow. I hope that you are none the worse for yesterday’s adventures.” “Quite fit, thank you.” “A dull world, Watson, in many ways. Great crimes are rare. I fancy that it is before the alliance of the forces of evil that the alliance of the forces of good can show their best work.” “What do you mean?” “I mean that if we had a great criminal, we should have a great detective. But we have had neither. The cases which come to me are, as you know, exceedingly trivial.” “I hope that you will not find this one trivial,” said I, as my eye fell upon a man who was sitting in a chair upon the other side of the fireplace, with his hands clasped and his head sunk upon his chest. He was a very stout, florid-faced, elderly man, with fiery red hair. His appearance was so remarkable that I could not help glancing at him, while I waited for Holmes to speak. “Ah, yes,” said Holmes, turning his eyes upon his client. “This is Mr. Jabez Wilson, and he has been good enough to call upon me this morning, and to lay before me a most singular statement.” Holmes sat down in his arm-chair and threw one leg over the other. “Mr. Wilson here has had a most extraordinary experience,” said he. “He will tell you all about it. Pray, Mr. Wilson, commence your narrative, and I promise you that I will not interrupt you until you have finished.” The client mopped his brow with a red silk handkerchief, and then, with a husky voice, he began his story. “Well, I am a pawnbroker,” said he, “and I have a small business at Coburg Square, near the City. It’s not a very large place, and I don’t do a great deal of business. I have a good many customers, but they are mostly poor people, and I don’t make much out of them.

          "text_segment": "I had called upon my friend Sherlock Holmes upon the second morning after Christmas, with the intention of wishing him the compliments of the season. He was lounging upon the sofa in a purple dressing-gown, a pipe-rack within his reach upon the right, and a pile of crumpled morning papers, evidently newly studied, near at hand. Beside the couch was a wooden chair, and on the angle of the back hung a very seedy and disreputable hard-felt hat, much the worse for wear, and cracked in several places. A lens and a forceps lying upon the seat of the chair suggested that the hat had been suspended in this manner for the purpose of examination.\n“You are engaged,” said I; “perhaps I interrupt you.”\n“Not at all. I am glad to have a friend with whom I can discuss my results. The matter is a perfectly trivial one”—he jerked his thumb in the direction of the old hat—“but there are points in connection with it which are not entirely devoid of interest and even of instruction.”\nI seated myself in his armchair and warmed my hands before his crackling fire, for a sharp frost had set in, and the windows were thick with the ice crystals. “I suppose,” I remarked, “that, homely as it looks, this thing has some deadly story linked on to it—that it is the clue which will guide you in the solution of some mystery and the punishment of some crime.”\n“No, no. No crime,” said Sherlock Holmes, laughing. “Only one of those whimsical little incidents which will happen when you have four million human beings all jostling each other within the space of a few square miles. Amid the action and reaction of so dense a swarm of humanity, every possible combination of events may be expected to take place, and many a little problem will be presented which may be striking and bizarre without being criminal. We have already had experience of such.”\n“So much so,” I remarked, “that of the last six cases which I have added to my notes, three have been entirely free of any legal crime.”\n“Precisely. You allude to my attempt to recover the Irene Adler papers, to the singular case of Miss Mary Sutherland, and to the adventure of the man with the twisted lip. Well, I have no doubt that this small matter will fall into the same innocent category. You know Peterson, the commissionaire?”\n“Yes.”\n“It is to him that this trophy belongs.”\n“It is his hat.”\n“No, no, he found it. Its owner is unknown. I beg that you will look upon it not as a battered billycock but as an intellectual problem. And, first, as to how it came here. It arrived upon Christmas morning, in company with a good fat goose, which is, I have no doubt, roasting at this moment in front of Peterson’s fire. The facts are these: about four o’clock on Christmas morning, Peterson, who, as you know, is a very honest fellow, was returning from some small jollification and was making his way homeward down Tottenham Court Road. In front of him he saw, in the gaslight, a tallish man, walking with a slight stagger, and carrying a white goose slung over his shoulder. As he reached the corner of Goodge Street, a row broke out between this stranger and a little knot of roughs. One of the latter knocked off the man’s hat, on which he raised his stick to defend himself and, swinging it over his head, smashed the shop window behind him. Peterson had rushed forward to protect the stranger from his assailants; but the man, shocked at having broken the window, and seeing an official-looking person in uniform rushing towards him, dropped his goose, took to his heels, and vanished amid the labyrinth of small streets which lie at the back of Tottenham Court Road. The roughs had also fled at the appearance of Peterson, so that he was left in possession of the field of battle, and also of the spoils of victory in the shape of this battered hat and a most unimpeachable Christmas goose.”\n“Which surely he restored to their owner?”\n“My dear fellow, there lies the problem. It is true that ‘For Mrs. Henry Baker’ was printed upon a small card which was tied to the bird’s left leg, and it is also true that the initials ‘H. B.’ are legible upon the lining of this hat, but as there are some thousands of Bakers, and some hundreds of Henry Bakers in this city of ours, it is not easy to restore lost property to any one of them.”\n“What, then, did Peterson do?”\n“He brought round both hat and goose to me on Christmas morning, knowing that even the smallest problems are of interest to me. The goose we retained until this morning, when there were signs that, in spite of the slight frost, it would be well that it should be eaten without unnecessary delay. Its finder has carried it off, therefore, to fulfil the ultimate destiny of a goose, while I continue to retain the hat of the unknown gentleman who lost his Christmas dinner.”",

He was lounging upon the sofa in a purple dressing-gown, a pipe-rack within his reach upon the right, and a pile of crumpled morning papers upon the left. Beside the couch was a wooden chair, and on the angle of the back hung a very seedy and disreputable hard felt hat, much the worse for wear, and cracked in several places. A lens and a forceps lay upon the seat of the chair. \"You are engaged,\" said I; \"perhaps I interrupt you.\" \"Not at all. I am glad to have a partner in my labours. The fact is that I am at a loss for want of a companion, and my brain is becoming stagnant. The agencies which I employ are of the widest possible character, but I am unprovided with one person who can give me a fresh point of view. You have occasionally been of very considerable use to me since you first started this partnership of ours.\" \"You mean,\" said I, \"that I have occasionally been useful in the way of giving a fresh point of view?\" \"Precisely. The difficulty is to detach one's self. The ideal reasoner would, when he had once been shown a single fact in all its bearings, deduce from it not only all the chain of events which led up to it, but also all the results which would follow from it. As Cuvier could deduce a whole animal from the contemplation of a single bone, so the observer who understands his subject should be able to deduce all the accessory circumstances from the single fact. But that master reasoner may fail us, none the less, if he cannot detach his mind from the effect of this or that accessory. To a great extent I supply that deficiency by cultivating the art of detachment. But I am bound to confess that even in my own case I find it occasionally difficult to get away from the more obtrusive facts. You will admit, Watson, that it is easy to confound personal qualities with impersonal facts. The most impassive observer is not unaffected by them. Come, for instance, on this hat.\" He picked it up and turned it round in his hands. \"It is a hat of the ordinary brown felt, with a curved brim, and the usual stiffening. There are no marks of the maker, but, as you perceive, the lining has been of red silk, and the maker's name has not been stamped upon it.

                "text": "I had called upon my friend Sherlock Holmes upon the second morning after Christmas, with the intention of wishing him the compliments of the season. He was lounging upon the sofa in a purple dressing-gown, a pipe-rack within his reach upon the right, and a pile of crumpled morning papers upon the left. Beside the couch was a wooden chair, and on the angle of the back hung a very seedy and disreputable hard felt hat, much the worse for wear, and cracked in several places. A lens and a forceps lay upon the seat of the chair. \"You are engaged,\" said I; \"perhaps I interrupt you.\" \"Not at all. I am glad to have a partner in my labours. The fact is that I am at a loss for want of a companion, and my brain is becoming stagnant. The agencies which I employ are of the widest possible character, but I am unprovided with one person who can give me a fresh point of view. You have occasionally been of very considerable use to me since you first started this partnership of ours.\" \"You mean,\" said I, \"that I have occasionally been useful in the way of giving a fresh point of view?\" \"Precisely. The difficulty is to detach one's self. The ideal reasoner would, when he had once been shown a single fact in all its bearings, deduce from it not only all the chain of events which led up to it, but also all the results which would follow from it. As Cuvier could deduce a whole animal from the contemplation of a single bone, so the observer who understands his subject should be able to deduce all the accessory circumstances from the single fact. But that master reasoner may fail us, none the less, if he cannot detach his mind from the effect of this or that accessory. To a great extent I supply that deficiency by cultivating the art of detachment. But I am bound to confess that even in my own case I find it occasionally difficult to get away from the more obtrusive facts. You will admit, Watson, that it is easy to confound personal qualities with impersonal facts. The most impassive observer is not unaffected by them. Come, for instance, on this hat.\" He picked it up and turned it round in his hands. \"It is a hat of the ordinary brown felt, with a curved brim, and the usual stiffening. There are no marks of the maker, but, as you perceive, the lining has been of red silk, and the maker's name has not been stamped upon it. It is a second-hand one.\" \"It is a very ordinary hat,\" I remarked. \"Just so. But it is very difficult to draw any deductions from a commonplace thing.

          "text_segment": "“Did he not advertise?”\n“No.”\n“Then, what clue could you have as to his identity?”\n“Only as much as we can deduce.”\n“From his hat?”\n“Precisely.”\n“But you are joking. What can you gather from this old battered felt?”\n“Here is my lens. You know my methods. What can you gather yourself as to the individuality of the man who has worn this article?”\nI took the tattered object in my hands and turned it over rather ruefully. It was a very ordinary black hat of the usual round shape, hard and much the worse for wear. The lining had been of red silk, but was a good deal discoloured. There was no maker’s name; but, as Holmes had remarked, the initials “H. B.” were scrawled upon one side. It was pierced in the brim for a hat-securer, but the elastic was missing. For the rest, it was cracked, exceedingly dusty, and spotted in several places, although there seemed to have been some attempt to hide the discoloured patches by smearing them with ink.\n“I can see nothing,” said I, handing it back to my friend.\n“On the contrary, Watson, you can see everything. You fail, however, to reason from what you see. You are too timid in drawing your inferences.”\n“Then, pray tell me what it is that you can infer from this hat?”\nHe picked it up and gazed at it in the peculiar introspective fashion which was characteristic of him. “It is perhaps less suggestive than it might have been,” he remarked, “and yet there are a few inferences which are very distinct, and a few others which represent at least a strong balance of probability. That the man was highly intellectual is of course obvious upon the face of it, and also that he was fairly well-to-do within the last three years, although he has now fallen upon evil days. He had foresight, but has less now than formerly, pointing to a moral retrogression, which, when taken with the decline of his fortunes, seems to indicate some evil influence, probably drink, at work upon him. This may account also for the obvious fact that his wife has ceased to love him.”\n“My dear Holmes!”\n“He has, however, retained some degree of self-respect,” he continued, disregarding my remonstrance. “He is a man who leads a sedentary life, goes out little, is out of training entirely, is middle-aged, has grizzled hair which he has had cut within the last few days, and which he anoints with lime-cream. These are the more patent facts which are to be deduced from his hat. Also, by the way, that it is extremely improbable that he has gas laid on in his house.”\n“You are certainly joking, Holmes.”\n“Not in the least. Is it possible that even now, when I give you these results, you are unable to see how they are attained?”\n“I have no doubt that I am very stupid, but I must confess that I am unable to follow you. For example, how did you deduce that this man was intellectual?”\nFor answer Holmes clapped the hat upon his head. It came right over the forehead and settled upon the bridge of his nose. “It is a question of cubic capacity,” said he; “a man with so large a brain must have something in it.”\n“The decline of his fortunes, then?”\n“This hat is three years old. These flat brims curled at the edge came in then. It is a hat of the very best quality. Look at the band of ribbed silk and the excellent lining. If this man could afford to buy so expensive a hat three years ago, and has had no hat since, then he has assuredly gone down in the world.”\n“Well, that is clear enough, certainly. But how about the foresight and the moral retrogression?”\nSherlock Holmes laughed. “Here is the foresight,” said he putting his finger upon the little disc and loop of the hat-securer. “They are never sold upon hats. If this man ordered one, it is a sign of a certain amount of foresight, since he went out of his way to take this precaution against the wind. But since we see that he has broken the elastic and has not troubled to replace it, it is obvious that he has less foresight now than formerly, which is a distinct proof of a weakening nature. On the other hand, he has endeavoured to conceal some of these stains upon the felt by daubing them with ink, which is a sign that he has not entirely lost his self-respect.”\n“Your reasoning is certainly plausible.”\n“The further points, that he is middle-aged, that his hair is grizzled, that it has been recently cut, and that he uses lime-cream, are all to be gathered from a close examination of the lower part of the lining. The lens discloses a large number of hair-ends, clean cut by the scissors of the barber. They all appear to be adhesive, and there is a distinct odour of lime-cream. This dust, you will observe, is not the gritty, grey dust of the street but the fluffy brown dust of the house, showing that it has been hung up indoors most of the time, while the marks of moisture upon the inside are proof positive that the wearer perspired very freely, and could therefore, hardly be in the best of training.”\n“But his wife—you said that she had ceased to love him.”\n“This hat has not been brushed for weeks. When I see you, my dear Watson, with a week’s accumulation of dust upon your hat, and when your wife allows you to go out in such a state, I shall fear that you also have been unfortunate enough to lose your wife’s affection.”\n“But he might be a bachelor.”\n“Nay, he was bringing home the goose as a peace-offering to his wife. Remember the card upon the bird’s leg.”\n“You have an answer to everything. But how on earth do you deduce that the gas is not laid on in his house?”\n“One tallow stain, or even two, might come by chance; but when I see no less than five, I think that there can be little doubt that the individual must be brought into frequent contact with burning tallow—walks upstairs at night probably with his hat in one hand and a guttering candle in the other. Anyhow, he never got tallow-stains from a gas-jet. Are you satisfied?”\n“Well, it is very ingenious,” said I, laughing; “but since, as you said just now, there has been no crime committed, and no harm done save the loss of a goose, all this seems to be rather a waste of energy.”\nSherlock Holmes had opened his mouth to reply, when the door flew open, and Peterson, the commissionaire, rushed into the apartment with flushed cheeks and the face of a man who is dazed with astonishment.",

B. is the name. I perceive also that he was a man of not extraordinary foresight, or he would not have taken an old hat.”\n“On the contrary, Watson, you can see that he was a man of considerable foresight, since he should never have started out upon so perilous a journey without consulting me. There is nothing remarkable about the hat save that, as I perceive, the man who wore it was supremely intellectual.”\nFor three years I have had a knowledge of his methods which has seldom been surpassed. I confess that his remarks filled me with a fresh astonishment. I was used to his drawing great conclusions from little premises, but I failed to see how he could deduce intellect from that old battered hat.\n“I can see nothing,” said I.\n“No, Watson, you see, but you do not observe. The distinction is clear. For example, you have frequently seen the steps which lead up from the hall to this room.”\n“Frequently.”\n“How many are there?”\n“I do not know.”\n“Quite so! You have not observed. And yet you have seen. That is just my point. Now, I know that there are seventeen steps, because I have both seen and observed. By the way, since you are interested in the problem, and since you have ample leisure, I would ask you to favour me by noting, with as much precision as you can, the chief characteristics of this hat. I have no doubt that you will find it a more fruitful study than I have found it myself.”\nI took the tattered object in my hands and turned it over rather ruefully. It was a very ordinary black felt hat, much the worse for wear, and cracked in several places. The lining was of discoloured red silk, and round the sweatband were the initials “H. B.”, in a sloping Gothic character. It was pierced in one place at the side, possibly by a hat-securer, and from the hole there dangled a piece of elastic. By the brim it was stained with mud in places, much frayed, and cracked. The rest of the hat was dusty and discoloured, with a broad band of reddish-brown round the brim where the nap had been rubbed off. I saw no sign of any other deduction possible.\n“I can see nothing, Holmes,” said I, handing it back.\n“On the contrary, Watson, you can see everything. You fail, however, to reason from what you see. You are too timid in drawing your inferences, and thereby you fall into error. Look at it closely once more. What do you deduce from this hat?”\nI endeavoured to follow my companion’s methods. I picked the hat up and turned it round in my hand once more. “The man was undoubtedly intellectual.”\nFor answer Holmes clapped the hat upon his own head. It came right down upon his forehead and rested upon his nose. “It is a question of cubic capacity,” said he; “a man with so large a brain must have something in it.”\n“The hat is a large one, certainly,” said I, “but as for the rest?”\n“He was, I have no doubt, a man of considerable property originally, but he has been poor for some years back. When he bought it, it was a hat of the very best quality. Look at the band of ribbed silk and the excellent lining. If this man has not very much money now, he had at one time, and it is likely that he has had some very heavy losses.”\n“But how do you deduce that?”\n“This hat is three years old. These ribbed bands are out of fashion now. He bought it at the height of the fashion, and has never troubled to replace it. It is a proof of declining fortunes.”\n“But how about the foresight and the moral retrogression?”\nHolmes laughed. “Here is the foresight,” said he, putting his finger upon the little loop of elastic at the side. “They are never sold upon hats now. If he had foresight he would have kept it on when he started. It is broken, you observe, and he has not troubled to replace it. There it is, you see, the foresight, and the want of it, which is the moral retrogression.”\n“Your deductions are certainly ingenious,” I remarked.\n“So simple, and yet it is not easy to see,” he answered; “that is the point. As to the moral retrogression, it is not that I object to the elastic being broken, but I object to a man who the year before last was sufficiently careful to hold his hat on upon a windy day, and yet now goes about with the elastic dangling, and cares nothing about it. It shows a deterioration of the man. There would be no object in starting to wear an elastic again, for he already possesses the foresight of having bought one. It is the want of care for the future which is the moral retrogression. But, as you say, it is all very simple. What do you see in the hat besides?”\n“Dust, and discolouration, and a stain of clay near the brim.”\n“Ah, but what do you deduce from that? It is the clay of London, not of the country. That is evident. It is a reddish clay, peculiar to the suburbs. There are only one or two spots where it is to be found. It is not far from the British Museum. You see, there is a little dust upon the brim. It is a fine dust, such as is found in the streets. There is also a little dust upon the lining. It is a coarse dust, such as is found in the country. It is evident that the man has been in the country lately, and has walked some distance, and has then come into London by train. The dust upon the brim is the dust of the streets, and the dust upon the lining is the dust of the country. It is a curious mixture, and it is not easy to explain how it got there. But it is evident that the man has been in the country lately.”\n“I see that,” said I.\n“Well, then, there is the stain of clay. It is a reddish clay, and it is found in the suburbs.

I picked the hat up and turned it round in my hand once more. “The man was undoubtedly intellectual.”\nFor answer Holmes clapped the hat upon his own head. It came right down upon his forehead and rested upon his nose. “It is a question of cubic capacity,” said he; “a man with so large a brain must have something in it.”\n“The hat is a large one, certainly,” said I, “but as for the rest?”\n“He was, I have no doubt, a man of considerable property originally, but he has been poor for some years back. When he bought it, it was a hat of the very best quality. Look at the band of ribbed silk and the excellent lining. If this man has not very much money now, he had at one time, and it is likely that he has had some very heavy losses.”\n“But how do you deduce that?”\n“This hat is three years old. These ribbed bands are out of fashion now. He bought it at the height of the fashion, and has never troubled to replace it. It is a proof of declining fortunes.”\n“But how about the foresight and the moral retrogression?”\nHolmes laughed. “Here is the foresight,” said he, putting his finger upon the little loop of elastic at the side. “They are never sold upon hats now. If he had foresight he would have kept it on when he started. It is broken, you observe, and he has not troubled to replace it. There it is, you see, the foresight, and the want of it, which is the moral retrogression.”\n“Your deductions are certainly ingenious,” I remarked.\n“So simple, and yet it is not easy to see,” he answered; “that is the point. As to the moral retrogression, it is not that I object to the elastic being broken, but I object to a man who the year before last was sufficiently careful to hold his hat on upon a windy day, and yet now goes about with the elastic dangling, and cares nothing about it. It shows a deterioration of the man. There would be no object in starting to wear an elastic again, for he already possesses the foresight of having bought one. It is the want of care for the future which is the moral retrogression. But, as you say, it is all very simple. What do you see in the hat besides?”\n“Dust, and discolouration, and a stain of clay near the brim.”\n“Ah, but what do you deduce from that? It is the clay of London, not of the country. That is evident. It is a reddish clay, peculiar to the suburbs. There are only one or two spots where it is to be found. It is not far from the British Museum. You see, there is a little dust upon the brim. It is a fine dust, such as is found in the streets. There is also a little dust upon the lining. It is a coarse dust, such as is found in the country. It is evident that the man has been in the country lately, and has walked some distance, and has then come into London by train. The dust upon the brim is the dust of the streets, and the dust upon the lining is the dust of the country. It is a curious mixture, and it is not easy to explain how it got there. But it is evident that the man has been in the country lately.”\n“I see that,” said I.\n“Well, then, there is the stain of clay. It is a reddish clay, and it is found in the suburbs.

Has it returned to life and flapped off through the kitchen window?” Holmes twisted himself round upon the sofa to get a fairer view of the man’s excited face.\n“See here, sir! See what my wife found in its crop!” He held out his hand and displayed upon the centre of the palm a brilliantly scintillating blue stone, rather smaller than a bean in size, but of such purity and radiance that it twinkled like an electric point in the dark hollow of his hand.\nSherlock Holmes sat up with a whistle. “By Jove, Peterson!” said he, “this is treasure trove indeed. I suppose you know what you have got?”\n“A diamond, sir? A precious stone. It cuts into glass as though it were putty.”\n“It’s more than a precious stone. It is the precious stone.”\n“Not the Countess of Morcar’s blue carbuncle!” I ejaculated.\n“Precisely so. I ought to know its size and shape, seeing that I have read the advertisement about it in The Times every day lately. It is absolutely unique, and its value can only be conjectured, but the reward offered of £ 1000 is certainly not within a twentieth part of the market price.”\n“A thousand pounds! Great Lord of mercy!” The commissionaire plumped down into a chair and stared from one to the other of us.\n“That is the reward, and I have reason to know that there are sentimental considerations in the background which would induce the Countess to part with half her fortune if she could but recover the gem.”\n“It was lost, if I remember aright, at the Hotel Cosmopolitan,” I remarked.\n“Precisely so, on December 22nd, just five days ago. John Horner, a plumber, was accused of having abstracted it from the lady’s jewel-case. The evidence against him was so strong that the case has been referred to the Assizes. I have some account of the matter here, I believe.” He rummaged amid his newspapers, glancing over the dates, until at last he smoothed one out, doubled it over, and read the following paragraph:\n“Hotel Cosmopolitan Jewel Robbery. John Horner, 26, plumber, was brought up upon the charge of having upon the 22nd inst., abstracted from the jewel-case of the Countess of Morcar the valuable gem known as the blue carbuncle. James Ryder, upper-attendant at the hotel, gave his evidence to the effect that he had shown Horner up to the dressing-room of the Countess of Morcar upon the day of the robbery in order that he might solder the second bar of the grate, which was loose. He had remained with Horner some little time, but had finally been called away. On returning, he found that Horner had disappeared, that the bureau had been forced open, and that the small morocco casket in which, as it afterwards transpired, the Countess was accustomed to keep her jewel, was lying empty upon the dressing-table. Ryder instantly gave the alarm, and Horner was arrested the same evening; but the stone could not be found either upon his person or in his rooms. Catherine Cusack, maid to the Countess, deposed to having heard Ryder’s cry of dismay on discovering the robbery, and to having rushed into the room, where she found matters as described by the last witness. Inspector Bradstreet, B division, gave evidence as to the arrest of Horner, who struggled frantically, and protested his innocence in the strongest terms. Evidence of a previous conviction for robbery having been given against the prisoner, the magistrate refused to deal summarily with the offence, but referred it to the Assizes. Horner, who had shown signs of intense emotion during the proceedings, fainted away at the conclusion and was carried out of court.”",

I have seen the advertisement about it.” “The Blue Carbuncle!” cried Peterson. “Yes, the Blue Carbuncle. It is unique, and its value is enormous.

So much for the police-court,” said Holmes thoughtfully, tossing aside the paper. “The question for us now to solve is the sequence of events leading from a rifled jewel-case at one end to the crop of a goose in Tottenham Court Road at the other. You see, Watson, our little deductions have suddenly assumed a much more important and less innocent aspect. Here is the stone; the stone came from the goose, and the goose came from Mr. Henry Baker, the gentleman with the bad hat and all the other characteristics with which I have bored you. So now we must set ourselves very seriously to finding this gentleman and ascertaining what part he has played in this little mystery. To do this, we must try the simplest means first, and these lie undoubtedly in an advertisement in all the evening papers. If this fail, I shall have recourse to other methods.”\n“What will you say?”\n“Give me a pencil and that slip of paper. Now, then: ‘Found at the corner of Goodge Street, a goose and a black felt hat. Mr. Henry Baker can have the same by applying at 6:30 this evening at 221B, Baker Street.’ That is clear and concise.”\n“Very. But will he see it?”\n“Well, he is sure to keep an eye on the papers, since, to a poor man, the loss was a heavy one. He was clearly so scared by his mischance in breaking the window and by the approach of Peterson that he thought of nothing but flight, but since then he must have bitterly regretted the impulse which caused him to drop his bird. Then, again, the introduction of his name will cause him to see it, for everyone who knows him will direct his attention to it. Here you are, Peterson, run down to the advertising agency and have this put in the evening papers.”\n“In which, sir?”\n“Oh, in the Globe, Star, Pall Mall, St. James’s Gazette, Evening News, Standard, Echo, and any others that occur to you.”\n“Very well, sir. And this stone?”\n“Ah, yes, I shall keep the stone. Thank you. And, I say, Peterson, just buy a goose on your way back and leave it here with me, for we must have one to give to this gentleman in place of the one which your family is now devouring.”\nWhen the commissionaire had gone, Holmes took up the stone and held it against the light. “It’s a bonny thing,” said he. “Just see how it glints and sparkles. Of course it is a nucleus and focus of crime. Every good stone is. They are the devil’s pet baits. In the larger and older jewels every facet may stand for a bloody deed. This stone is not yet twenty years old. It was found in the banks of the Amoy River in southern China and is remarkable in having every characteristic of the carbuncle, save that it is blue in shade instead of ruby red. In spite of its youth, it has already a sinister history. There have been two murders, a vitriol-throwing, a suicide, and several robberies brought about for the sake of this forty-grain weight of crystallised charcoal. Who would think that so pretty a toy would be a purveyor to the gallows and the prison? I’ll lock it up in my strong box now and drop a line to the Countess to say that we have it.”\n“Do you think that this man Horner is innocent?”\n“I cannot tell.”\n“Well, then, do you imagine that this other one, Henry Baker, had anything to do with the matter?”\n“It is, I think, much more likely that Henry Baker is an absolutely innocent man, who had no idea that the bird which he was carrying was of considerably more value than if it were made of solid gold. That, however, I shall determine by a very simple test if we have an answer to our advertisement.”\n“And you can do nothing until then?”\n“Nothing.”\n“In that case I shall continue my professional round. But I shall come back in the evening at the hour you have mentioned, for I should like to see the solution of so tangled a business.”\n“Very glad to see you. I dine at seven. There is a woodcock, I believe. By the way, in view of recent occurrences, perhaps I ought to ask Mrs. Hudson to examine its crop.”",

But the real question is, how did it travel from the Countess of Morcar’s cabinet to the crop of a goose?”“And from the goose to the hat?” added I.“Exactly. So we have traced the reward to the hat, and the hat to the man, but now we must trace the man to the goose. We have already got a clue to the identity of the gentleman who lost the bird and the hat.”“Of course, Henry Baker.”“No, no, Watson. Not Henry Baker. That was his name for the moment. The question is, who is he? What is his address? Where does he live? There are a hundred Henry Bakers in this city, and we need to find the right one. But we have a little data to go upon. The man is poor, or he would not be carrying his Christmas goose about the streets. He is a man of some sense and self-respect, or he would not long have worn such a battered hat. He is a widower, and his wife has only recently ceased to love him. He has forearms which are larger than his upper arms, and he is a man who takes a good deal of exercise, and makes a point of his legs and arms. He is a man of thirty to forty years of age, and he is a man who has been in the habit of wearing a hat for some years. And, finally, he is a man who has a goose of the Prague breed, with a black bar across the tail.”“But how are we to find him?”“Well, Watson, there are only two ways of finding him. The first is to go to every house in the district and inquire. The second is to advertise.”“But he may not see the advertisement.”“He will see it, Watson. He is a poor man, and the loss of his goose and hat will be a serious matter to him. He will be looking for them. And his friends will be looking for them. And they will see the advertisement.”“What shall we say?”“We shall say that a goose and a hat were found in Goodge Street, and that the owner can have them by applying at 221B Baker Street this evening between the hours of six and eight.”“And you think he will come?”“I am sure he will come. He is a poor man, and he will be glad to get his goose and hat back. And he will be curious to know how they came to be found.”“And what shall we do when he comes?”“We shall ask him a few questions, Watson. We shall ask him where he got the goose, and what he knows about the carbuncle.”“And if he is the thief?”“Then we shall hand him over to the police. But I do not think he is the thief. I think he is an innocent man, who has been made a tool of.”“But how can we be sure?”“We cannot be sure, Watson. But we can try. And the first step is to find him.”He rang the bell, and when Peterson appeared, he said: “I suppose you have not had time to go down to the station yet, Peterson?”“Yes, sir. I have been down, and I have seen the inspector. He says that Horner is a man of excellent character, and that he has never been in trouble before. But he says that the evidence is clear, and that he has no doubt that Horner is the thief.”“Well, well, we shall see. Now, Peterson, I want you to do something for me. I want you to take this advertisement to the offices of the evening papers, and have it inserted in all of them.”He handed him a sheet of paper, on which he had written:LOST, in Goodge Street, a GOOSE and a black felt HAT. Mr. HENRY BAKER can have the same by applying at 221B Baker Street this evening, between six and eight. “And you can add, Peterson, that if Mr. Baker will be good enough to call, he will be rewarded.”“Very good, sir. And the goose, sir? What am I to do with the goose?”“Oh, yes, the goose. I had forgotten the goose. Well, you can take the goose with you, Peterson, and you can sell it to a poulterer. Or you can eat it yourself. Or you can give it to a friend. Or you can do what you like with it. But I should like you to buy me another goose, Peterson, a good fat one, and bring it here this evening.”“Very good, sir. And the carbuncle, sir? What am I to do with the carbuncle?”“Ah, yes, the carbuncle. I had forgotten the carbuncle. Well, you can take the carbuncle with you, Peterson, and you can sell it to a jeweller. Or you can keep it yourself. Or you can give it to a friend. Or you can do what you like with it. But I should like you to give it to me, Peterson, and I will take care of it.”“Very good, sir.” And Peterson left the room with the goose and the carbuncle. “Well, Watson,” said Holmes, when the door was closed, “what do you think of that?”“I think that you are a very extraordinary man.”“Well, I am. But that is neither here nor there. The question is, what are we to do now?”“I suppose we must wait until Mr. Baker comes.”“Yes, we must wait until Mr. Baker comes. And in the meantime, we can have a little chat about the carbuncle. It is a very interesting stone. It was found in the crop of a goose, you know.”“Yes, I know.”“And it is the Blue Carbuncle of the Countess of Morcar. It is one of the most famous jewels in the world. It is said to be worth twenty thousand pounds.”“Indeed!”“Yes. And it has a history. It was found in China, about twenty years ago. And it has been in Europe",

But the real question is, how did it travel from the Countess of Morcar’s cabinet to the crop of a goose?”“And from the goose to the hat?” added I.“Exactly. So we have traced the reward to the hat, and the hat to the man, but now we must trace the man to the goose. We have already got a clue to the identity of the gentleman who lost the bird and the hat.”“Of course, Henry Baker.”“No, no, Watson. Not Henry Baker. That was his name for the moment. The question is, who is he? What is his address? Where does he live? There are a hundred Henry Bakers in this city, and we need to find the right one. But we have a little data to go upon. The man is poor, or he would not be carrying his Christmas goose about the streets. He is a man of some sense and self-respect, or he would not long have worn such a battered hat. He is a widower, and his wife has only recently ceased to love him. He has forearms which are larger than his upper arms, and he is a man who takes a good deal of exercise, and makes a point of his legs and arms. He is a man of thirty to forty years of age, and he is a man who has been in the habit of wearing a hat for some years. And, finally, he is a man who has a goose of the Prague breed, with a black bar across the tail.”“But how are we to find him?”“Well, Watson, there are only two ways of finding him. The first is to go to every house in the district and inquire. The second is to advertise.”“But he may not see the advertisement.”“He will see it, Watson. He is a poor man, and the loss of his goose and hat will be a serious matter to him. He will be looking for them. And his friends will be looking for them. And they will see the advertisement.”“What shall we say?”“We shall say that a goose and a hat were found in Goodge Street, and that the owner can have them by applying at 221B Baker Street this evening between the hours of six and eight.”“And you think he will come?”“I am sure he will come. He is a poor man, and he will be glad to get his goose and hat back. And he will be curious to know how they came to be found.”“And what shall we do when he comes?”“We shall ask him a few questions, Watson. We shall ask him where he got the goose, and what he knows about the carbuncle.”“And if he is the thief?”“Then we shall hand him over to the police. But I do not think he is the thief. I think he is an innocent man, who has been made a tool of.”“But how can we be sure?”“We cannot be sure, Watson. But we can try. And the first step is to find him.”He rang the bell, and when Peterson appeared, he said: “I suppose you have not had time to go down to the station yet, Peterson?”“Yes, sir. I have been down, and I have seen the inspector. He says that Horner is a man of excellent character, and that he has never been in trouble before. But he says that the evidence is clear, and that he has no doubt that Horner is the thief.”“Well, well, we shall see. Now, Peterson, I want you to do something for me. I want you to take this advertisement to the offices of the evening papers, and have it inserted in all of them.”He handed him a sheet of paper, on which he had written:LOST, in Goodge Street, a GOOSE and a black felt HAT. Mr. HENRY BAKER can have the same by applying at 221B Baker Street this evening, between six and eight. “And you can add, Peterson, that if Mr. Baker will be good enough to call, he will be rewarded.”“Very good, sir. And the goose, sir? What am I to do with the goose?”“Oh, yes, the goose. I had forgotten the goose. Well, you can take the goose with you, Peterson, and you can sell it to a poulterer. Or you can eat it yourself. Or you can give it to a friend. Or you can do what you like with it. But I should like you to buy me another goose, Peterson, a good fat one, and bring it here this evening.”“Very good, sir. And the carbuncle, sir? What am I to do with the carbuncle?”“Ah, yes, the carbuncle. I had forgotten the carbuncle. Well, you can take the carbuncle with you, Peterson, and you can sell it to a jeweller. Or you can keep it yourself. Or you can give it to a friend. Or you can do what you like with it. But I should like you to give it to me, Peterson, and I will take care of it.”“Very good, sir.” And Peterson left the room with the goose and the carbuncle. “Well, Watson,” said Holmes, when the door was closed, “what do you think of that?”“I think that you are a very extraordinary man.”“Well, I am. But that is neither here nor there. The question is, what are we to do now?”“I suppose we must wait until Mr. Baker comes.”“Yes, we must wait until Mr. Baker comes. And in the meantime, we can have a little chat about the carbuncle. It is a very interesting stone. It was found in the crop of a goose, you know.”“Yes, I know.”“And it is the Blue Carbuncle of the Countess of Morcar. It is one of the most famous jewels in the world. It is said to be worth twenty thousand pounds.”“Indeed!”“Yes. And it has a history. It was found in China, about twenty years ago. And it has been in Europe",

As I approached the house I saw a tall man in a Scotch bonnet with a coat which was buttoned up to his chin waiting outside in the bright semicircle which was thrown from the fanlight. Just as I arrived the door was opened, and we were shown up together to Holmes’ room.\n“Mr. Henry Baker, I believe,” said he, rising from his armchair and greeting his visitor with the easy air of geniality which he could so readily assume. “Pray take this chair by the fire, Mr. Baker. It is a cold night, and I observe that your circulation is more adapted for summer than for winter. Ah, Watson, you have just come at the right time. Is that your hat, Mr. Baker?”\n“Yes, sir, that is undoubtedly my hat.”\nHe was a large man with rounded shoulders, a massive head, and a broad, intelligent face, sloping down to a pointed beard of grizzled brown. A touch of red in nose and cheeks, with a slight tremor of his extended hand, recalled Holmes’ surmise as to his habits. His rusty black frock-coat was buttoned right up in front, with the collar turned up, and his lank wrists protruded from his sleeves without a sign of cuff or shirt. He spoke in a slow staccato fashion, choosing his words with care, and gave the impression generally of a man of learning and letters who had had ill-usage at the hands of fortune.\n“We have retained these things for some days,” said Holmes, “because we expected to see an advertisement from you giving your address. I am at a loss to know now why you did not advertise.”\nOur visitor gave a rather shamefaced laugh. “Shillings have not been so plentiful with me as they once were,” he remarked. “I had no doubt that the gang of roughs who assaulted me had carried off both my hat and the bird. I did not care to spend more money in a hopeless attempt at recovering them.”\n“Very naturally. By the way, about the bird, we were compelled to eat it.”\n“To eat it!” Our visitor half rose from his chair in his excitement.\n“Yes, it would have been of no use to anyone had we not done so. But I presume that this other goose upon the sideboard, which is about the same weight and perfectly fresh, will answer your purpose equally well?”\n“Oh, certainly, certainly,” answered Mr. Baker with a sigh of relief.\n“Of course, we still have the feathers, legs, crop, and so on of your own bird, so if you wish—”\nThe man burst into a hearty laugh. “They might be useful to me as relics of my adventure,” said he, “but beyond that I can hardly see what use the disjecta membra of my late acquaintance are going to be to me. No, sir, I think that, with your permission, I will confine my attentions to the excellent bird which I perceive upon the sideboard.”\nSherlock Holmes glanced sharply across at me with a slight shrug of his shoulders.\n“There is your hat, then, and there your bird,” said he. “By the way, would it bore you to tell me where you got the other one from? I am somewhat of a fowl fancier, and I have seldom seen a better grown goose.”\n“Certainly, sir,” said Baker, who had risen and tucked his newly gained property under his arm. “There are a few of us who frequent the Alpha Inn, near the Museum—we are to be found in the Museum itself during the day, you understand. This year our good host, Windigate by name, instituted a goose club, by which, on consideration of some few pence every week, we were each to receive a bird at Christmas. My pence were duly paid, and the rest is familiar to you. I am much indebted to you, sir, for a Scotch bonnet is fitted neither to my years nor my gravity.” With a comical pomposity of manner he bowed solemnly to both of us and strode off upon his way.\n“So much for Mr. Henry Baker,” said Holmes when he had closed the door behind him. “It is quite certain that he knows nothing whatever about the matter. Are you hungry, Watson?”",

As I approached the house I saw a tall man in front of me walking with a slight stagger and a jaunty manner. He was evidently the man whom Holmes had saved from the clutches of the commissionaire. I quickened my pace, and just as I reached the door he stopped and turned the knob. I had some hesitation as to whether I should follow him in, or whether I should not first announce my presence by a knock. There was some little doubt, also, as to how far my unexpected appearance might be desirable or otherwise in the eyes of my friend. I decided not to risk it, and was just standing by the door on the pavement when he opened it and emerged. We met upon the step. I stood incognito as it were upon my own doorstep, while he, looking far larger and more august than ever, stood framed in the full glare of the hall lamp. He held in his hand a grey goose, with black legs, like the one which we had examined in the morning. \"Ah, Watson, my dear fellow,\" said he with a cheerful smile. \"Come in and join our little council. You are just in time to see the winding up of a little problem which the commissionaire has been good enough to bring us. This, Mr. Henry Baker, is a gentleman who is a humble partner of mine in many of my most successful cases. I am sure that he will be as interested as I am in observing the singularly unexpected termination of your case.\" Our visitor was a man of remarkable appearance. Ill-dressed as he was, with his collar turned up and the cuffs of his coat frayed, he still preserved an air of dignity and a certain solidity which showed that he was not unaccustomed to prosperous days. His face, though bearing every mark of coarse feeding and hard living, was nonetheless intelligent and even interesting. He had a high, bald forehead, and a grizzled beard which framed his lower face and combined with a pair of bushy eyebrows to give him a venerable, patriarchal appearance. Around his shoulders he wore a cravat of faded silk, and the front of his dingy coat was stained with grease and marked with many traces of snuff. \"Sit down, Mr. Henry Baker, sit down,\" said Holmes, pushing forward an armchair. \"This is your hat, is it not?\" \"Yes, sir, that is undoubtedly my hat.\" He clasped it in his hands, and his haggard face lighted up at the sight of it. \"It is my hat,\" he repeated with a husky voice. \"Thank God I have got my hat!\" \"He was afraid that you would advertise it,\" said Holmes to me. \"Quite so. Of course he was afraid that I would advertise it. Where should I get the money to advertise? I am a poor man, sir, and my hat is old but I value it highly. It is true that I have had some little misfortune lately, and that I am not quite so well off as I used to be, but I am still a respectable man, sir, and I hope I shall always be so. I am sure I am very much obliged to you for taking care of my hat.\" \"Not at all. We are glad to have been of service to you. I was afraid that you were not going to turn up.\" \"I should have come earlier, sir, but I was detained. I am a member of a goose club at the Alpha Inn, and I was there to-day to get my bird. I have been a member for five years, and I have never missed a Christmas bird yet. I am a little late this year, but I have got it at last. And a fine bird it is, sir. I have it here in my hand.\" He held up the goose, and I saw that it was a magnificent bird, with a plump breast and a glossy plumage. \"It is a fine bird, indeed,\" said Holmes. \"And you say that you got it at the Alpha Inn?\" \"Yes, sir, at the Alpha Inn, in the street behind the Museum. I am a member of the goose club there. We pay a shilling a week, and at Christmas we each get a goose. It is a very good club, and Mr. Windigate, the landlord, is a very honest man. I have been a member for five years, and I have never had any reason to complain.\" \"And you say that you were detained?\" \"Yes, sir, I was detained. I was at the Alpha Inn, and I was just coming away with my goose when I met a friend, and we had a glass together. And then I met another friend, and we had another glass. And so on, sir, until I was a little late. But I have got my goose at last, and I am very much obliged to you for taking care of my hat.\" \"Not at all. By the way, we were compelled to eat the goose that you brought us. I hope that the bird which you have brought with you to-day is as good.\" \"Eat it!\" cried our visitor with a crestfallen air. \"You ate my goose!\" \"Yes, it really was impossible to keep it. It would have been of no use to you. But we have a very fine goose here, which I ordered yesterday. Would you do me the favour of taking it in exchange?\" \"My dear sir, my dear sir!\" cried the man with a voice of emotion. \"Let me see it. Yes, it is a magnificent bird! Upon my word, sir, I am greatly your debtor. You are a gentleman. I have never met with such behaviour in my life. I am sure that I am very much obliged to you.\" He would not take the goose, however, until I had assured him that it was a present, and that I should be hurt if he did not accept it. \"You are too good, sir, too good!\" he repeated, and he bowed and scraped until I was quite ashamed of the fuss that I had made. \"Well, well, it is a trifle,\" said Holmes. \"We are glad to have been of service to you. By the way, before you go, would you mind telling us where you got the other goose? I am a bit of a fowl fancier, and I have seldom seen a better-fed bird.\" \"Certainly, sir. I got it at the Alpha Inn, as I told you.\" \"And where did the Alpha get it?\" \"He buys them, sir, by the score from a salesman in Covent Garden.\" \"Indeed! I should like to know the salesman's name. It might be useful to me.\" \"I can tell you that, sir. His name is Breckinridge, and he has a stall in the market.\" \"Thank you. One other question.

            "prefix-probing": "I had been delayed at a case, and it was a little after half-past six when I found myself in Baker Street once more. The fog, which had lain thick all day, was beginning to lift slightly, revealing the gas lamps in the street below as blurred halos of light. I climbed the seventeen steps to our sitting-room with a sense of pleasant anticipation. After a day spent wrestling with the mundane details of a domestic squabble – a case of misplaced jewellery and bruised feelings that had taxed my patience more than my intellect – the prospect of returning to the stimulating atmosphere of 221B was a welcome one. I knew that whatever Holmes was engaged upon, it would be something far removed from the petty anxieties of suburban life.\n\nI opened the door and stepped into the familiar room. The air was thick with the acrid smell of chemicals, mingled with the faint, not unpleasant, odour of shag tobacco. Holmes was seated by the fire, not in his usual armchair, but perched on the edge of a hard-backed chair, his long, lean figure hunched over a small table. A powerful magnifying glass was in his hand, and his eyes, keen and penetrating, were fixed upon an object that lay before him. The table was littered with various items: a pair of tarnished silver spurs, a crumpled piece of paper, a small, intricately carved wooden box, and several other odds and ends that looked utterly disconnected to my untrained eye.\n\nHe did not look up as I entered, his concentration absolute. I took off my coat and hat, hung them on the stand, and moved quietly towards the fire, holding out my hands to the cheerful blaze. The silence stretched for a minute or two, broken only by the crackling of the coals and the occasional rustle of Holmes's clothing as he shifted slightly.\n\nAt length, he sighed, a long, low sound, and leaned back, running a hand through his dark, unruly hair. He placed the magnifying glass carefully on the table and turned his head towards me, a faint smile playing on his lips.\n\n\"Ah, Watson, you return,\" he said, his voice low and resonant. \"I trust your day has been... illuminating? Or merely tedious?\" His eyes, even from across the room, seemed to take in every detail of my appearance.\n\n\"Tedious, Holmes, I'm afraid,\" I replied, sinking into my own armchair. \"A most uninspiring affair. A Mrs. Abernathy and her missing brooch. It transpired her maid had merely borrowed it for an evening out. No mystery, no intrigue, merely human folly and a lack of communication.\" I rubbed my hands together, feeling the warmth seep into them.\n\nHolmes chuckled softly. \"The commonplace is often the most difficult to unravel, my dear fellow, precisely because it lacks the striking features that draw the eye of the observer. But I confess, I prefer a problem with a little more... flavour.\" He gestured towards the table with his chin. \"I have been amusing myself with a small matter that arrived by post this morning.\"\n\nI looked at the collection of objects. \"And what do you make of it?\" I asked, my curiosity piqued. It was always fascinating to see Holmes at the beginning of an investigation, before he had formulated his theories.\n\n\"As yet, very little that is concrete,\" he admitted. \"But there are points of interest. These spurs, for instance. Note the peculiar wear pattern on the rowels. Not the wear of a rider, certainly. And the paper... a fragment of a theatre programme, I believe, but from which theatre, and when? The box is perhaps the most intriguing. It is of Indian origin, I fancy, but the carving is crude, almost amateurish, yet with certain symbols that suggest a deeper meaning. They were all contained in a plain wooden box, addressed simply to 'Mr. S. Holmes, Baker Street'. No return address, no accompanying letter, nothing to indicate the sender or their purpose.\"\n\nHe picked up the crumpled paper and smoothed it out gently. \"The postmark is London, but smudged. It arrived with the early delivery. Someone wishes to present me with a puzzle, Watson, or perhaps a warning. The disparate nature of the items suggests they are clues, but clues to what? A crime? A message? Or merely a test of my abilities?\" He leaned forward again, his eyes once more fixed on the objects, his mind already racing ahead, connecting the seemingly unconnected"

Outside, the stars were shining coldly in a cloudless sky, and the breath of the passers-by blew out into smoke like so many pistol shots. Our footfalls rang out crisply and loudly as we swung through the doctors’ quarter, Wimpole Street, Harley Street, and so through Wigmore Street into Oxford Street. In a quarter of an hour we were in Bloomsbury at the Alpha Inn, which is a small public-house at the corner of one of the streets which runs down into Holborn. Holmes pushed open the door of the private bar and ordered two glasses of beer from the ruddy-faced, white-aproned landlord.\n“Your beer should be excellent if it is as good as your geese,” said he.\n“My geese!” The man seemed surprised.\n“Yes. I was speaking only half an hour ago to Mr. Henry Baker, who was a member of your goose club.”\n“Ah! yes, I see. But you see, sir, them’s not our geese.”\n“Indeed! Whose, then?”\n“Well, I got the two dozen from a salesman in Covent Garden.”\n“Indeed? I know some of them. Which was it?”\n“Breckinridge is his name.”\n“Ah! I don’t know him. Well, here’s your good health landlord, and prosperity to your house. Good-night.”\n“Now for Mr. Breckinridge,” he continued, buttoning up his coat as we came out into the frosty air. “Remember, Watson that though we have so homely a thing as a goose at one end of this chain, we have at the other a man who will certainly get seven years’ penal servitude unless we can establish his innocence. It is possible that our inquiry may but confirm his guilt; but, in any case, we have a line of investigation which has been missed by the police, and which a singular chance has placed in our hands. Let us follow it out to the bitter end. Faces to the south, then, and quick march!”",

I am myself famished for a mouthful, but half an hour will be enough for me, and then we can start for the Alpha.”“Very good. I have been wondering what clue you proposed to follow.”“There is none,” said Holmes, smiling. “I act entirely in the dark. Still, we have some distinguishing features to guide us. This man Baker was a gentleman, and that he was a poor man may be taken for granted. So, also, may the fact that he was not a habitual frequenter of public-houses, and that he was a man of some feeling, since he wrote a silly advertisement in the papers. These few indications are all that I have to act upon. My own move in the matter will be, as you afterwards saw, to advertise for the owner of the goose and hat. It would be useless, of course, to advertise for the thief, since he knows that he is wanted. Barring that, I really have no idea how I am to proceed. I am as puzzled as you are.”“But what of the Alpha?”“Well, I told you that the hat was new last autumn. Now, we see the weather is exceedingly cold, and it is quite natural that a gentleman of the name of Henry Baker should retain his hat from year to year. Therefore we have a double chance of getting upon his track.”“Should he be there?”“Dr. Watson, if you will have the kindness to touch the bell, we shall get an answer to that question.”The landlady proved to be a brisk, little woman, with the gentle smile which is the hall-mark of her profession. “Mr. Henry Baker, did you say, sir?” she asked on our inquiry. “No, sir, we have no lodgers of that name here. He used to be a member of our goose club, though, and a most pleasant, amiable gentleman he was. We’d lose him now. It’s a year or more since he dropped out of it.”“Ah, that is unfortunate!” I remarked.“Why so? Did you wish to see him?”“Yes, we have some little business with him.”“He lives, I fancy, somewhere in the Bloomsbury district. He was a writer for the papers, I remember.”“Pray, can you give me his address?”“I am afraid I cannot. You see, he paid his club dues, and so long as he did that nothing more was needed. We knew nothing of him outside the club.”“Can you tell me anything of the goose club?”“Oh, yes. We have it every year. Mr. Baker was one of our regular members. He paid five shillings at the start of the winter, and his share of the geese came to him at Christmas.”“Were there many members?”“Twenty-seven.”“And did you all get a goose?”“Yes, sir. Twenty-seven geese.”“And were they all alike?”“They varied a good deal. We had one big one and twenty-six smaller ones.”“Ah, I see. And what became of the big one?”“I don’t know, sir. It was Mr. Baker’s share.”“I see. Well, I am sorry to have troubled you. Thank you very much.”We left the inn and walked briskly through the cold, bracing air. Holmes was silent and thoughtful. At last he said, “Well, Watson, we have made a little progress. We know that Mr. Henry Baker was a member of the Alpha Inn goose club, and that he received a large goose at Christmas. That is something, at any rate.”“But we don’t know where he lives.”“No, that is true. But we have a clue. The goose was a large one, and it was Mr. Baker’s share. Now, where did the Alpha Inn get its geese?”“I don’t know.”“Well, I think we can find out. Let us go back and ask the landlady.”We returned to the inn, and Holmes put the question to the landlady. “Where did you get your geese, ma’am?”“Oh, we got them from a salesman in Covent Garden. His name is Breckinridge.”“Breckinridge,” repeated Holmes. “I don’t think I know the name. Is he a large dealer?”“Yes, sir. He deals in poultry and game of all sorts.”“Thank you, ma’am. You have been very helpful.”We left the inn again, and Holmes rubbed his hands together. “Well, Watson, we are on the right track now. We know that Mr. Henry Baker got his goose from the Alpha Inn, and that the Alpha Inn got its geese from Breckinridge in Covent Garden. Now, all we have to do is to find Breckinridge and ask him about the goose.”“But what if he doesn’t remember?”“He will remember,” said Holmes confidently",

One of the largest stalls bore the name of Breckinridge upon it, and the proprietor a horsey-looking man, with a sharp face and trim side-whiskers was helping a boy to put up the shutters.\n“Good-evening. It’s a cold night,” said Holmes.\nThe salesman nodded and shot a questioning glance at my companion.\n“Sold out of geese, I see,” continued Holmes, pointing at the bare slabs of marble.\n“Let you have five hundred to-morrow morning.”\n“That’s no good.”\n“Well, there are some on the stall with the gas-flare.”\n“Ah, but I was recommended to you.”\n“Who by?”\n“The landlord of the Alpha.”\n“Oh, yes; I sent him a couple of dozen.”\n“Fine birds they were, too. Now where did you get them from?”\nTo my surprise the question provoked a burst of anger from the salesman.\n“Now, then, mister,” said he, with his head cocked and his arms akimbo, “what are you driving at? Let’s have it straight, now.”\n“It is straight enough. I should like to know who sold you the geese which you supplied to the Alpha.”\n“Well then, I shan’t tell you. So now!”\n“Oh, it is a matter of no importance; but I don’t know why you should be so warm over such a trifle.”\n“Warm! You’d be as warm, maybe, if you were as pestered as I am. When I pay good money for a good article there should be an end of the business; but it’s ‘Where are the geese?’ and ‘Who did you sell the geese to?’ and ‘What will you take for the geese?’ One would think they were the only geese in the world, to hear the fuss that is made over them.”\n“Well, I have no connection with any other people who have been making inquiries,” said Holmes carelessly. “If you won’t tell us the bet is off, that is all. But I’m always ready to back my opinion on a matter of fowls, and I have a fiver on it that the bird I ate is country bred.”\n“Well, then, you’ve lost your fiver, for it’s town bred,” snapped the salesman.\n“It’s nothing of the kind.”\n“I say it is.”\n“I don’t believe it.”\n“D’you think you know more about fowls than I, who have handled them ever since I was a nipper? I tell you, all those birds that went to the Alpha were town bred.”\n“You’ll never persuade me to believe that.”\n“Will you bet, then?”\n“It’s merely taking your money, for I know that I am right. But I’ll have a sovereign on with you, just to teach you not to be obstinate.”\nThe salesman chuckled grimly. “Bring me the books, Bill,” said he.\nThe small boy brought round a small thin volume and a great greasy-backed one, laying them out together beneath the hanging lamp.\n“Now then, Mr. Cocksure,” said the salesman, “I thought that I was out of geese, but before I finish you’ll find that there is still one left in my shop. You see this little book?”\n“Well?”\n“That’s the list of the folk from whom I buy. D’you see? Well, then, here on this page are the country folk, and the numbers after their names are where their accounts are in the big ledger. Now, then! You see this other page in red ink? Well, that is a list of my town suppliers. Now, look at that third name. Just read it out to me.”\n“Mrs. Oakshott, 117, Brixton Road—249,” read Holmes.\n“Quite so. Now turn that up in the ledger.”\nHolmes turned to the page indicated. “Here you are, ‘Mrs. Oakshott, 117, Brixton Road, egg and poultry supplier.’”\n“Now, then, what’s the last entry?”\n“‘December 22nd. Twenty-four geese at 7s. 6d.’”\n“Quite so. There you are. And underneath?”\n“‘Sold to Mr. Windigate of the Alpha, at 12s.’”\n“What have you to say now?”\nSherlock Holmes looked deeply chagrined. He drew a sovereign from his pocket and threw it down upon the slab, turning away with the air of a man whose disgust is too deep for words. A few yards off he stopped under a lamp-post and laughed in the hearty, noiseless fashion which was peculiar to him.\n“When you see a man with whiskers of that cut and the ‘Pink ’un’ protruding out of his pocket, you can always draw him by a bet,” said he. “I daresay that if I had put £ 100 down in front of him, that man would not have given me such complete information as was drawn from him by the idea that he was doing me on a wager. Well, Watson, we are, I fancy, nearing the end of our quest, and the only point which remains to be determined is whether we should go on to this Mrs. Oakshott to-night, or whether we should reserve it for to-morrow. It is clear from what that surly fellow said that there are others besides ourselves who are anxious about the matter, and I should—”",

The pavement was covered with brown cabbage leaves, broken stalks, and orange peel, and the air reeked with the strong, fresh odour of vegetables. Rows of great wicker baskets lined the pavement, filled with dark green broccoli, white celery, and piles of potatoes, carrots, and onions. In the butchers’ shops the carcasses of sheep and pigs hung from hooks, and from the poulterers’ the dead birds, plucked and trussed, were dangling from the rafters. Here and there a few green-grocers and poulterers were still engaged in clearing their stalls and packing away the unsold portions of their stock, while a few shivering wanderers, with their shoulders up to their ears and their hands thrust into their pockets, stalked morosely in the hope of picking up some refuse which might be of use to them. The owner of the goose stall not be difficult to find. There were not more than a dozen in the whole market. Holmes stopped at one of these. It was kept by a stout, red-faced man, with a great fluffy hatchet face, and a blotchy, sallow complexion. He was leaning against a pile of baskets, with his feet tucked away among the straw, and his two hands thrust into his breeches pockets. He stared stolidly at Holmes, and then at me, until the consultant addressed him.\n\n“Good morning, sir. It is a cold morning,” said Holmes.\n\n“Ay, sir; you feel it all the more when you stand here doing nothing. Look at these geese, sir? All sold out, every one of them, to-day.”\n\n“Indeed!” said Holmes. “I should have thought that, with the Christmas market over, there would be a glut of them. How is it that you come to sell out?”\n\n“To my customers, sir. It’s by my customers that I live.”\n\n“Well, I don’t know that I ever saw a finer lot. I congratulate you on your success.”\n\n“It’s hard work, sir, and plenty of early rising. They come in before I am out of my bed sometimes.”\n\n“Ah, that’s what I should like to know. Where do you get them from?”\n\nTo my surprise, the stout man appeared to be offended by this simple question.\n\n“Come now, sir,” said he, “I make no secrets about the business. Here is the book. You can see for yourself. Where do I get them from, indeed?”\n\n“Well, I was recommended to you,” said Holmes, “by a friend of mine who lives at the Alpha.”\n\n“Oh, ay, I send a lot o’ geese up to the Alpha.”\n\n“That’s where I saw the goose that I was speaking of. I was dining there yesterday, and our bird was of such an extraordinary quality that I was tempted to ask where it came from. The landlord said that it was supplied by you.”\n\n“Which was it, then?”\n\n“A grey goose, with a black bar across the tail.”\n\n“Oh, yes. I remember it well. It was one of twenty-four that were sent to me at the beginning of December from a country breeder.”\n\n“Ah, I see. And where did you send it to?”\n\n“To the Alpha, as you say.”\n\n“And where did you get it from?” asked Holmes again.\n\nThe poulterer’s brow knitted into a frown. “Now, then, mister,” said he, “what is it that you are driving at? Let’s have it straight. You have had your say. Now it is my turn. There is no use beating about the bush.”\n\n“I don’t know what you mean,” said Holmes, with a innocent air.\n\n“Oh, yes, you do. You have been asking me questions about this goose ever since you came here. You want to know where it came from. Well, I tell you that it came from a country breeder.”\n\n“But I want to know the name of the breeder.”\n\n“Well, I don’t know that I am called upon to tell you that.”\n\n“Oh, yes, you are.

            "prefix-probing": "We passed across Holborn, down Endell Street, and so through a zigzag of slums to Covent Garden Market. The transition was abrupt and striking. One moment we were threading our way through narrow, squalid alleys where the air hung heavy with the damp chill of poverty and neglect, and the next we emerged into a vast, bustling arena of commerce, vibrant with colour and clamour. The market was in full swing, a kaleidoscope of activity under the grey London sky. Piles of crimson apples and golden oranges rose like miniature mountains, interspersed with the delicate hues of flowers – roses, lilies, carnations – their fragrance a welcome antidote to the stale air we had just left. The ground was littered with discarded leaves and straw, damp from the morning's watering, and the air hummed with the guttural shouts of porters, the sharp cries of vendors hawking their wares, and the general murmur of the throng. Drays rumbled in and out, laden with produce, their horses steaming in the cool air. It was a scene of robust, earthy life, a microcosm of London's tireless energy.\n\nHolmes paused just inside the entrance, his keen eyes sweeping over the chaotic scene with that peculiar intensity that always marked his moments of deep observation. He seemed to absorb every detail simultaneously – the hurried step of a buyer, the furtive glance of a seller, the condition of a man's boots, the stain on a woman's apron. I stood beside him, feeling somewhat overwhelmed by the sheer volume of sensory input, content to let his superior faculties sift through the data. I knew he was not here merely to admire the spectacle; there was a purpose behind this visit, though as yet he had vouchsafed me no explanation.\n\nAfter a minute or two, his gaze seemed to fix upon a particular point within the market. His lean face, usually so impassive, showed a flicker of interest, a tightening around the eyes. He began to move forward, not with the hurried stride he sometimes adopted when on a hot scent, but with a slow, deliberate pace, weaving through the crowds. I followed close behind, my eyes attempting to discern what had captured his attention. He led me towards the flower section, where the air was thick with perfume and the stalls were ablaze with colour. Here, amidst the delicate beauty, worked a rougher class of men and women, their hands stained with earth and green, their faces often weather-beaten and shrewd.\n\nHolmes stopped near a stall piled high with magnificent orchids. The vendor was a burly man with a florid face and hands like spades, arguing boisterously with a customer over the price of a spray of cymbidiums. Holmes paid them no mind. His attention was fixed on a young woman standing slightly apart from the main crush, near a stack of empty crates. She was perhaps twenty years of age, dressed in plain, dark clothes that seemed ill-suited to the vibrant surroundings. Her face was pale and drawn, with large, anxious eyes that darted nervously about the market. In her hands, she clutched a small, brown paper parcel. There was something in her demeanour – a combination of fear and desperate hope – that set her apart from the busy, purposeful crowd.\n\nHolmes watched her for a long moment, his head tilted slightly. Then, with a sudden decision, he began to move towards her. I hesitated for a second, unsure if I should follow, but his steady progress indicated that this was part of his plan. As we approached, the young woman seemed to sense our presence. Her eyes widened, and she clutched the parcel tighter. Holmes stopped a few feet away, his expression one of calm inquiry, devoid of any threat.\n\n'Good morning,' he said, his voice quiet but clear, cutting through the market din. 'You seem troubled, miss. Is there something I might assist you with?'\n\nShe stared at him, her lips trembling slightly. For a moment, I thought she might turn and flee. But something in Holmes's steady gaze seemed"

Turning round we saw a little rat-faced fellow standing in the centre of the circle of yellow light which was thrown by the swinging lamp, while Breckinridge, the salesman, framed in the door of his stall, was shaking his fists fiercely at the cringing figure.\n“I’ve had enough of you and your geese,” he shouted. “I wish you were all at the devil together. If you come pestering me any more with your silly talk I’ll set the dog at you. You bring Mrs. Oakshott here and I’ll answer her, but what have you to do with it? Did I buy the geese off you?”\n“No; but one of them was mine all the same,” whined the little man.\n“Well, then, ask Mrs. Oakshott for it.”\n“She told me to ask you.”\n“Well, you can ask the King of Proosia, for all I care. I’ve had enough of it. Get out of this!” He rushed fiercely forward, and the inquirer flitted away into the darkness.\n“Ha! this may save us a visit to Brixton Road,” whispered Holmes. “Come with me, and we will see what is to be made of this fellow.” Striding through the scattered knots of people who lounged round the flaring stalls, my companion speedily overtook the little man and touched him upon the shoulder. He sprang round, and I could see in the gas-light that every vestige of colour had been driven from his face.\n“Who are you, then? What do you want?” he asked in a quavering voice.\n“You will excuse me,” said Holmes blandly, “but I could not help overhearing the questions which you put to the salesman just now. I think that I could be of assistance to you.”\n“You? Who are you? How could you know anything of the matter?”\n“My name is Sherlock Holmes. It is my business to know what other people don’t know.”\n“But you can know nothing of this?”\n“Excuse me, I know everything of it. You are endeavouring to trace some geese which were sold by Mrs. Oakshott, of Brixton Road, to a salesman named Breckinridge, by him in turn to Mr. Windigate, of the Alpha, and by him to his club, of which Mr. Henry Baker is a member.”\n“Oh, sir, you are the very man whom I have longed to meet,” cried the little fellow with outstretched hands and quivering fingers. “I can hardly explain to you how interested I am in this matter.”\nSherlock Holmes hailed a four-wheeler which was passing. “In that case we had better discuss it in a cosy room rather than in this wind-swept market-place,” said he. “But pray tell me, before we go farther, who it is that I have the pleasure of assisting.”\nThe man hesitated for an instant. “My name is John Robinson,” he answered with a sidelong glance.\n“No, no; the real name,” said Holmes sweetly. “It is always awkward doing business with an alias.”\nA flush sprang to the white cheeks of the stranger. “Well then,” said he, “my real name is James Ryder.”\n“Precisely so. Head attendant at the Hotel Cosmopolitan. Pray step into the cab, and I shall soon be able to tell you everything which you would wish to know.”\nThe little man stood glancing from one to the other of us with half-frightened, half-hopeful eyes, as one who is not sure whether he is on the verge of a windfall or of a catastrophe. Then he stepped into the cab, and in half an hour we were back in the sitting-room at Baker Street. Nothing had been said during our drive, but the high, thin breathing of our new companion, and the claspings and unclaspings of his hands, spoke of the nervous tension within him.",

I will just put on my slippers before we settle this little matter of yours. Now, then! You want to know what became of those geese?”\n“Yes, sir.”\n“Or rather, I fancy, of that goose. It was one bird, I imagine in which you were interested—white, with a black bar across the tail.”\nRyder quivered with emotion. “Oh, sir,” he cried, “can you tell me where it went to?”\n“It came here.”\n“Here?”\n“Yes, and a most remarkable bird it proved. I don’t wonder that you should take an interest in it. It laid an egg after it was dead—the bonniest, brightest little blue egg that ever was seen. I have it here in my museum.”\nOur visitor staggered to his feet and clutched the mantelpiece with his right hand. Holmes unlocked his strong-box and held up the blue carbuncle, which shone out like a star, with a cold, brilliant, many-pointed radiance. Ryder stood glaring with a drawn face, uncertain whether to claim or to disown it.\n“The game’s up, Ryder,” said Holmes quietly. “Hold up, man, or you’ll be into the fire! Give him an arm back into his chair, Watson. He’s not got blood enough to go in for felony with impunity. Give him a dash of brandy. So! Now he looks a little more human. What a shrimp it is, to be sure!”\nFor a moment he had staggered and nearly fallen, but the brandy brought a tinge of colour into his cheeks, and he sat staring with frightened eyes at his accuser.\n“I have almost every link in my hands, and all the proofs which I could possibly need, so there is little which you need tell me. Still, that little may as well be cleared up to make the case complete. You had heard, Ryder, of this blue stone of the Countess of Morcar’s?”\n“It was Catherine Cusack who told me of it,” said he in a crackling voice.\n“I see—her ladyship’s waiting-maid. Well, the temptation of sudden wealth so easily acquired was too much for you, as it has been for better men before you; but you were not very scrupulous in the means you used. It seems to me, Ryder, that there is the making of a very pretty villain in you. You knew that this man Horner, the plumber, had been concerned in some such matter before, and that suspicion would rest the more readily upon him. What did you do, then? You made some small job in my lady’s room—you and your confederate Cusack—and you managed that he should be the man sent for. Then, when he had left, you rifled the jewel-case, raised the alarm, and had this unfortunate man arrested. You then—”\nRyder threw himself down suddenly upon the rug and clutched at my companion’s knees. “For God’s sake, have mercy!” he shrieked. “Think of my father! Of my mother! It would break their hearts. I never went wrong before! I never will again. I swear it. I’ll swear it on a Bible. Oh, don’t bring it into court! For Christ’s sake, don’t!”\n“Get back into your chair!” said Holmes sternly. “It is very well to cringe and crawl now, but you thought little enough of this poor Horner in the dock for a crime of which he knew nothing.”\n“I will fly, Mr. Holmes. I will leave the country, sir. Then the charge against him will break down.”\n“Hum! We will talk about that. And now let us hear a true account of the next act. How came the stone into the goose, and how came the goose into the open market? Tell us the truth, for there lies your only hope of safety.”\nRyder passed his tongue over his parched lips. “I will tell you it just as it happened, sir,” said he. “When Horner had been arrested, it seemed to me that it would be best for me to get away with the stone at once, for I did not know at what moment the police might not take it into their heads to search me and my room. There was no place about the hotel where it would be safe. I went out, as if on some commission, and I made for my sister’s house. She had married a man named Oakshott, and lived in Brixton Road, where she fattened fowls for the market. All the way there every man I met seemed to me to be a policeman or a detective; and, for all that it was a cold night, the sweat was pouring down my face before I came to the Brixton Road. My sister asked me what was the matter, and why I was so pale; but I told her that I had been upset by the jewel robbery at the hotel. Then I went into the back yard and smoked a pipe and wondered what it would be best to do.\n“I had a friend once called Maudsley, who went to the bad, and has just been serving his time in Pentonville. One day he had met me, and fell into talk about the ways of thieves, and how they could get rid of what they stole. I knew that he would be true to me, for I knew one or two things about him; so I made up my mind to go right on to Kilburn, where he lived, and take him into my confidence. He would show me how to turn the stone into money. But how to get to him in safety? I thought of the agonies I had gone through in coming from the hotel. I might at any moment be seized and searched, and there would be the stone in my waistcoat pocket. I was leaning against the wall at the time and looking at the geese which were waddling about round my feet, and suddenly an idea came into my head which showed me how I could beat the best detective that ever lived.\n“My sister had told me some weeks before that I might have the pick of her geese for a Christmas present, and I knew that she was always as good as her word. I would take my goose now, and in it I would carry my stone to Kilburn. There was a little shed in the yard, and behind this I drove one of the birds—a fine big one, white, with a barred tail. I caught it, and prying its bill open, I thrust the stone down its throat as far as my finger could reach. The bird gave a gulp, and I felt the stone pass along its gullet and down into its crop. But the creature flapped and struggled, and out came my sister to know what was the matter. As I turned to speak to her the brute broke loose and fluttered off among the others.\n“‘Whatever were you doing with that bird, Jem?’ says she.\n“‘Well,’ said I, ‘you said you’d give me one for Christmas, and I was feeling which was the fattest.’\n“‘Oh,’ says she, ‘we’ve set yours aside for you—Jem’s bird, we call it. It’s the big white one over yonder. There’s twenty-six of them, which makes one for you, and one for us, and two dozen for the market.’\n“‘Thank you, Maggie,’ says I; ‘but if it is all the same to you, I’d rather have that one I was handling just now.’\n“‘The other is a good three pound heavier,’ said she, ‘and we fattened it expressly for you.’\n“‘Never mind. I’ll have the other, and I’ll take it now,’ said I.\n“‘Oh, just as you like,’ said she, a little huffed. ‘Which is it you want, then?’\n“‘That white one with the barred tail, right in the middle of the flock.’\n“‘Oh, very well. Kill it and take it with you.’\n“Well, I did what she said, Mr. Holmes, and I carried the bird all the way to Kilburn. I told my pal what I had done, for he was a man that it was easy to tell a thing like that to. He laughed until he choked, and we got a knife and opened the goose. My heart turned to water, for there was no sign of the stone, and I knew that some terrible mistake had occurred. I left the bird, rushed back to my sister’s, and hurried into the back yard. There was not a bird to be seen there.\n“‘Where are they all, Maggie?’ I cried.\n“‘Gone to the dealer’s, Jem.’\n“‘Which dealer’s?’\n“‘Breckinridge, of Covent Garden.’\n“‘But was there another with a barred tail?’ I asked, ‘the same as the one I chose?’\n“‘Yes, Jem; there were two barred-tailed ones, and I could never tell them apart.’\n“Well, then, of course I saw it all, and I ran off as hard as my feet would carry me to this man Breckinridge; but he had sold the lot at once, and not one word would he tell me as to where they had gone. You heard him yourselves to-night. Well, he has always answered me like that. My sister thinks that I am going mad. Sometimes I think that I am myself. And now—and now I am myself a branded thief, without ever having touched the wealth for which I sold my character. God help me! God help me!” He burst into convulsive sobbing, with his face buried in his hands.",

Excuse me one moment until I have stuffed my pipe.” He sat down with his back to the trim little fire and puffed thoughtfully for some moments. We had all three remained standing during this time. I had taken the bird from Holmes’s grasp and was laying it upon the table, when I happened to glance at the face of the man who had less than an hour before sworn so solemnly to his innocence. I have never seen such a sight of abject fear, nor such a ghastly livid pallor. The stout blonde man was cowering in the corner and his knees were shaking so violently that we could hear the rattle of them. “James Ryder,” said Holmes, “sit down in that chair. I should like to have a few friendly words with you.” The man sank into the chair which had been pushed forward for him and sat there shuddering with his face buried in his hands. “I suppose you know why I have brought you here?” asked Holmes. “No, sir.” “It is because I want to know what became of those geese.” “Geese, sir?” “Yes, the geese, Mr. Ryder. You knew of them, I understand. And particularly of one big white one with a black bar across the tail.” “Oh, sir!” gasped the man. “The matter is a trifle, and yet it is exceedingly important to me. Pray tell me, then, where did the goose go to?” “To the dealer, sir.” “Oh, the dealer. Well, I have had the dealer here to-night and he assures me that he knows nothing about them. Look here, Ryder, can you lay your hand upon your heart and say that it is not your goose?” The man seemed to be undergoing the most violent internal struggle. He half rose, as if he would fly, then sank back again, with a groan. “Oh, sir,” he cried, “for heaven’s sake have mercy upon me! Save me, save me!” “Certainly—unless you have yourself committed a crime.” “What crime have I committed, sir? I don’t know what you mean.” “What do you mean by this, then?” Holmes had opened his coat, and was rummaging in a breast-pocket, when suddenly it seemed to me that he was about to draw a pistol, but it was something else that he brought out. It was a little box of blue satin, with a clasp to it, and from it he took a small, brilliant stone. “You say that you do not know what crime you have committed?” asked Holmes, looking keenly at him. “Take a good look at this stone.” He held it out in his hand. Ryder gave a convulsive gasp and a stare. Then he staggered forward and clutched the mantelpiece with one hand. Holmes rose and laid the stone upon the edge of the table. “The game is up, Ryder,” said he. “Hold up, man, or you’ll be down. Watson, lend a hand! He’ll be all right in a minute. He has fainted.” We loosened his cravat, and Holmes thrust the brandy-bottle against his lips. He swallowed a little, and sat up, staring with a white face and frightened eyes at the glittering jewel upon the table. “Well, Ryder, there is no use dissembling further. You know that I know that you are the man. We have it all here save that which you can supply. Now, then, the first thing that I want to know is, what did you do with the stone?” “Oh, Mr. Holmes, I am ruined for ever!” cried the man, his face convulsed with horror. “I will tell you everything, sir. Pray have mercy upon me! I have never been arrested before in all my life—never done anything to get myself in the clutches of the law. I will never, never do such a thing again. I swear it, sir! Oh, be merciful, and do not tell my father and mother. It would break their hearts. I am a poor man, sir, and I was sorely tempted. Catherine Cusack she knew all about it. We planned it together. She told me all about how the Countess had a jewel which she would not trust to the safety of a bank, and how she would daily carry it about with her in a jewel-case. With my own eyes I saw the jewel-case when I carried it down to the brougham that morning. Catherine told me, too, where the jewel would be, and how the room would be empty when Horner would be there. ‘For Horner,’ said she, ‘would be sure to be blamed if the thing was missing, and it would make a great scandal.’ So I went to the hotel the night before and I engaged a room, as the police have proved. I was to come to the room when Horner had been there. I came, and Horner was gone, and the case was lying on the table. There was my chance. I opened the case, got out the stone, and shut it again. I then raised the alarm, and Horner was secured. Then I was in possession of the stone. I was terrified. The police were all over the place, and I did not know what to do. I slipped out and went home, and all the way I was wondering how I could get rid of the stone without being searched. I had not thought out any plans to keep it, for Catherine Cusack would have at once told the police all that she knew. I could not keep it. I could not sell it. It would be sure to be missed at once, and they would be upon my track. There was only one way out. I must take it to some place where I could hide it, and then could get away myself. I thought of my sister’s house.” “The wife of John Horner?” asked Holmes. “No, sir, of Mr. Oakshott, the Brixton poulterer. My sister had promised me a goose for Christmas, and I had gone round to her place to select one. I was feeling bad and scared and miserable, and when I got to the house I did not know what to do. I was to meet Catherine Cusack that evening, and consult with her what was to be done with the stone, but there was a house-to-house search being made everywhere, and I knew that I should be searched myself. There was my sister’s husband, too, at the door, and I did not know how to get in without his seeing me. I thought of a place where I could hide the stone. I had it in my hand, and I was looking round for somewhere to put it when my sister came out. She saw that I was pale and ill, and asked me what was the matter. I told her that I was feeling a bit off colour, and asked her to let me have the goose that was promised me. She said that it was ready for me, and that I had better come in and have a glass of something hot. But I did not dare to come in for fear that I should be searched. I thought to myself that I would hide the stone in the goose, and that I would carry it away with me. I caught hold of the goose, and I felt the stone in my hand. The bird was a big white one, with a black bar across the tail. I opened its mouth, and I forced the stone down its throat. The bird struggled, and my sister came out to see what was the matter. As I was doing it, I heard a step behind me, and there was my sister. I just had time to push the bird back among the others, and my sister said, ‘Why, Jem, whatever are you doing with the geese?’ I said that I was just looking at them, and that I wanted to pick out the fattest one for my Christmas dinner. ‘Well,’ said she, ‘they are all fat, Jem. There are twenty-six of them, and they are all ready for the market.’ There was a big white goose that was set apart for me, and my sister said, ‘That’s your bird, Jem.’ But I knew that I had put the stone into the other goose, and I wanted to get hold of that one. ‘No,’ said I, ‘I like this one best. It is a big one, and it is a fine bird.’ ‘Well,’ said she, ‘take it, then, and be off with you, for I have no time to stand here talking.’ I took the goose, and I went away. I went to my friend Maudsley, who lives in Kilburn, and I told him all about it. He was a bad man, and he had been in prison before. He told me that he would help me to get rid of the stone. We cut",

It is possible that I might have placed them upon record before, but a promise of secrecy was made at the time, from which I have only been freed during the last month by the untimely death of the lady to whom the pledge was given. It is perhaps as well that the facts should now come to light, for I have reasons to know that there are widespread rumours as to the death of Dr. Grimesby Roylott which tend to make the matter even more terrible than the truth.\nIt was early in April in the year ’83 that I woke one morning to find Sherlock Holmes standing, fully dressed, by the side of my bed. He was a late riser, as a rule, and as the clock on the mantelpiece showed me that it was only a quarter-past seven, I blinked up at him in some surprise, and perhaps just a little resentment, for I was myself regular in my habits.\n“Very sorry to knock you up, Watson,” said he, “but it’s the common lot this morning. Mrs. Hudson has been knocked up, she retorted upon me, and I on you.”\n“What is it, then—a fire?”\n“No; a client. It seems that a young lady has arrived in a considerable state of excitement, who insists upon seeing me. She is waiting now in the sitting-room. Now, when young ladies wander about the metropolis at this hour of the morning, and knock sleepy people up out of their beds, I presume that it is something very pressing which they have to communicate. Should it prove to be an interesting case, you would, I am sure, wish to follow it from the outset. I thought, at any rate, that I should call you and give you the chance.”\n“My dear fellow, I would not miss it for anything.”\nI had no keener pleasure than in following Holmes in his professional investigations, and in admiring the rapid deductions, as swift as intuitions, and yet always founded on a logical basis with which he unravelled the problems which were submitted to him. I rapidly threw on my clothes and was ready in a few minutes to accompany my friend down to the sitting-room. A lady dressed in black and heavily veiled, who had been sitting in the window, rose as we entered.\n“Good-morning, madam,” said Holmes cheerily. “My name is Sherlock Holmes. This is my intimate friend and associate, Dr. Watson, before whom you can speak as freely as before myself. Ha! I am glad to see that Mrs. Hudson has had the good sense to light the fire. Pray draw up to it, and I shall order you a cup of hot coffee, for I observe that you are shivering.”\n“It is not cold which makes me shiver,” said the woman in a low voice, changing her seat as requested.\n“What, then?”\n“It is fear, Mr. Holmes. It is terror.” She raised her veil as she spoke, and we could see that she was indeed in a pitiable state of agitation, her face all drawn and grey, with restless frightened eyes, like those of some hunted animal. Her features and figure were those of a woman of thirty, but her hair was shot with premature grey, and her expression was weary and haggard. Sherlock Holmes ran her over with one of his quick, all-comprehensive glances.\n“You must not fear,” said he soothingly, bending forward and patting her forearm. “We shall soon set matters right, I have no doubt. You have come in by train this morning, I see.”\n“You know me, then?”\n“No, but I observe the second half of a return ticket in the palm of your left glove. You must have started early, and yet you had a good drive in a dog-cart, along heavy roads, before you reached the station.”\nThe lady gave a violent start and stared in bewilderment at my companion.\n“There is no mystery, my dear madam,” said he, smiling. “The left arm of your jacket is spattered with mud in no less than seven places. The marks are perfectly fresh.",

Sir, I can stand this strain no longer; I shall go mad if it continues. I have no one to turn to—none, save only one, who cares for me, and he, poor fellow, can be of little aid. I have heard of you, Mr. Holmes; I have heard of you from Mrs. Farintosh, whom you helped in the hour of her sore need. It was from her that I had your address. Oh, sir, do you not think that you could help me, too, and at least throw a little light through the dense darkness which surrounds me? At present it is out of my power to reward you for your services, but in a month or six weeks I shall be married, with the control of my own income, and then at least you shall not find me ungrateful.”\nHolmes turned to his desk and, unlocking it, drew out a small case-book, which he consulted.\n“Farintosh,” said he. “Ah yes, I recall the case; it was concerned with an opal tiara. I think it was before your time, Watson. I can only say, madam, that I shall be happy to devote the same care to your case as I did to that of your friend. As to reward, my profession is its own reward; but you are at liberty to defray whatever expenses I may be put to, at the time which suits you best. And now I beg that you will lay before us everything that may help us in forming an opinion upon the matter.”\n“Alas!” replied our visitor, “the very horror of my situation lies in the fact that my fears are so vague, and my suspicions depend so entirely upon small points, which might seem trivial to another, that even he to whom of all others I have a right to look for help and advice looks upon all that I tell him about it as the fancies of a nervous woman. He does not say so, but I can read it from his soothing answers and averted eyes. But I have heard, Mr. Holmes, that you can see deeply into the manifold wickedness of the human heart. You may advise me how to walk amid the dangers which encompass me.”\n“I am all attention, madam.”\n“My name is Helen Stoner, and I am living with my stepfather, who is the last survivor of one of the oldest Saxon families in England, the Roylotts of Stoke Moran, on the western border of Surrey.”\nHolmes nodded his head. “The name is familiar to me,” said he.\n“The family was at one time among the richest in England, and the estates extended over the borders into Berkshire in the north, and Hampshire in the west. In the last century, however, four successive heirs were of a dissolute and wasteful disposition, and the family ruin was eventually completed by a gambler in the days of the Regency. Nothing was left save a few acres of ground, and the two-hundred-year-old house, which is itself crushed under a heavy mortgage. The last squire dragged out his existence there, living the horrible life of an aristocratic pauper; but his only son, my stepfather, seeing that he must adapt himself to the new conditions, obtained an advance from a relative, which enabled him to take a medical degree and went out to Calcutta, where, by his professional skill and his force of character, he established a large practice. In a fit of anger, however, caused by some robberies which had been perpetrated in the house, he beat his native butler to death and narrowly escaped a capital sentence. As it was, he suffered a long term of imprisonment and afterwards returned to England a morose and disappointed man.\n“When Dr. Roylott was in India he married my mother, Mrs. Stoner, the young widow of Major-General Stoner, of the Bengal Artillery. My sister Julia and I were twins, and we were only two years old at the time of my mother’s re-marriage. She had a considerable sum of money—not less than £ 1000 a year—and this she bequeathed to Dr. Roylott entirely while we resided with him, with a provision that a certain annual sum should be allowed to each of us in the event of our marriage. Shortly after our return to England my mother died—she was killed eight years ago in a railway accident near Crewe. Dr. Roylott then abandoned his attempts to establish himself in practice in London and took us to live with him in the old ancestral house at Stoke Moran. The money which my mother had left was enough for all our wants, and there seemed to be no obstacle to our happiness.\n“But a terrible change came over our stepfather about this time. Instead of making friends and exchanging visits with our neighbours, who had at first been overjoyed to see a Roylott of Stoke Moran back in the old family seat, he shut himself up in his house and seldom came out save to indulge in ferocious quarrels with whoever might cross his path. Violence of temper approaching to mania has been hereditary in the men of the family, and in my stepfather’s case it had, I believe, been intensified by his long residence in the tropics. A series of disgraceful brawls took place, two of which ended in the police-court, until at last he became the terror of the village, and the folks would fly at his approach, for he is a man of immense strength, and absolutely uncontrollable in his anger.\n“Last week he hurled the local blacksmith over a parapet into a stream, and it was only by paying over all the money which I could gather together that I was able to avert another public exposure. He had no friends at all save the wandering gipsies, and he would give these vagabonds leave to encamp upon the few acres of bramble-covered land which represent the family estate, and would accept in return the hospitality of their tents, wandering away with them sometimes for weeks on end. He has a passion also for Indian animals, which are sent over to him by a correspondent, and he has at this moment a cheetah and a baboon, which wander freely over his grounds and are feared by the villagers almost as much as their master.\n“You can imagine from what I say that my poor sister Julia and I had no great pleasure in our lives. No servant would stay with us, and for a long time we did all the work of the house. She was but thirty at the time of her death, and yet her hair had already begun to whiten, even as mine has.”\n“Your sister is dead, then?”\n“She died just two years ago, and it is of her death that I wish to speak to you. You can understand that, living the life which I have described, we were little likely to see anyone of our own age and position. We had, however, an aunt, my mother’s maiden sister, Miss Honoria Westphail, who lives near Harrow, and we were occasionally allowed to pay short visits at this lady’s house. Julia went there at Christmas two years ago, and met there a half-pay major of marines, to whom she became engaged. My stepfather learned of the engagement when my sister returned and offered no objection to the marriage; but within a fortnight of the day which had been fixed for the wedding, the terrible event occurred which has deprived me of my only companion.”",

As you say, I have come from the country this morning, and I have driven from Leatherhead in a dog-cart. There is a friend of mine, Mrs. Farintosh, who has heard of your methods from my aunt, Miss Honoria Westphail, and she suggested that I should come to you when my aunt was here in town. I wish to God that I had come sooner!”“You are young, and apparently happy,” said Holmes, looking at her with his keen, introspective eyes. “You seem to be in excellent spirits, too. Pray tell me what has happened to bring you here and to discompose you in this fashion.”“It is fear, Mr. Holmes. It is terror!” she cried, catching him by the sleeve and looking round as if she expected every instant to see some dreadful sight. “It is fear of my life.”“My dear young lady, you alarm me. Pray sit down and tell me all about it.”She crouched into a chair and her limbs were shaking. She had hardly seated herself before she burst out into an agony of sobbing. “I am afraid to tell you,” she said at last, “and yet I am sure that you are the only man in the world who can help me. My sister died two years ago, and I believe that her death was due to foul play. I have lived ever since under a cloud of vague suspicion, and now I think that some dreadful fate is threatening me also.”“You must speak out,” said Sherlock Holmes. “You must tell me all the facts. I assure you that I will use them to the best of my ability.”“I will, Mr. Holmes. I will. I am not rich, nor have I any expectations of being so. I do not know how I can ever pay a fee, but I am sure that I can lay a little on one side every year, and in a few years I hope that I may be able to meet your demands.”Holmes smiled and shook his head. “I would not burden you with a fee just now,” he said. “You may pay me when you have the money, or you may never pay me at all if you find it inconvenient. Sit here upon the couch, and let me have the whole story of your troubles.”She sat down, and I noticed that she shivered as she did so. “I shall be as brief as I can,” she said. “I am Helen Stoner, and I am living with my stepfather, who is the last survivor of one of the oldest Saxon families in England, the Roylotts of Stoke Moran, in Surrey. By the mother’s side I am a descendant of the ancient Huguenots, who have been settled in England for many centuries. There is a good deal of history attached to my family, both good and bad. There have been famous soldiers and sailors, but also some very wicked men. My stepfather is Dr. Grimesby Roylott. He was a medical man, but he gave up his practice when he inherited the family property. He is a man of very violent temper, and he has been known to commit acts of great brutality. He was married to my mother, who was a widow with two daughters, of whom I am the younger. My mother had a considerable fortune, which she left to my stepfather upon trust, that he should provide for us until we married. We lived in India for some years, where my stepfather had a large practice. He was a man of great strength and energy, but he was also a man of violent passions. In a fit of anger he beat his native butler to death and was sentenced to a long term of imprisonment. He served half of his sentence and then was released. He came back to England and married my mother. We lived in London for a short time, and then my mother died in a railway accident. My stepfather then took us to Stoke Moran, where he has lived ever since. He is a man of very peculiar habits. He has no friends, and he never goes out. He lives in a large, old house, which is surrounded by a park. He has a number of animals, which he has brought from India. He has a cheetah and a baboon, which run about the grounds. He is a man of great strength, and he is very violent when he is angry. He has been known to strike people with his fists. He is feared by everyone in the village. He has no servants, and he does everything for himself. My sister and I had to do all the housework. We had a very lonely life. We never saw anyone. We were not allowed to go out. We had no friends. My sister was two years older than I. She was a very beautiful girl. She was engaged to be married to a major in the marines, and she was to have been married in a fortnight. She died very suddenly. It was a terrible shock to me. I have never been the same since. I have been very nervous and depressed. I have had no one to talk to. I have been very lonely. I have been afraid to tell anyone about my fears. I have been afraid that they would think that I was mad. I have been afraid that they would not believe me. I have been afraid that they would laugh at me. I have been afraid that they would think that I was making it all up. I have been afraid that they would think that I was trying to get attention. I have been afraid that they would think that I was trying to get money. I have been afraid that they would think that I was trying to get revenge.

As you say, I have come from the country this morning, and I have driven from Leatherhead in a dog-cart. There is a friend of mine, Mrs. Farintosh, who has heard of your methods from my aunt, Miss Honoria Westphail, and she suggested that I should come to you when my aunt was here in town. I wish to God that I had come sooner!”“You are young, and apparently happy,” said Holmes, looking at her with his keen, introspective eyes. “You seem to be in excellent spirits, too. Pray tell me what has happened to bring you here and to discompose you in this fashion.”“It is fear, Mr. Holmes. It is terror!” she cried, catching him by the sleeve and looking round as if she expected every instant to see some dreadful sight. “It is fear of my life.”“My dear young lady, you alarm me. Pray sit down and tell me all about it.”She crouched into a chair and her limbs were shaking. She had hardly seated herself before she burst out into an agony of sobbing. “I am afraid to tell you,” she said at last, “and yet I am sure that you are the only man in the world who can help me. My sister died two years ago, and I believe that her death was due to foul play. I have lived ever since under a cloud of vague suspicion, and now I think that some dreadful fate is threatening me also.”“You must speak out,” said Sherlock Holmes. “You must tell me all the facts. I assure you that I will use them to the best of my ability.”“I will, Mr. Holmes. I will. I am not rich, nor have I any expectations of being so. I do not know how I can ever pay a fee, but I am sure that I can lay a little on one side every year, and in a few years I hope that I may be able to meet your demands.”Holmes smiled and shook his head. “I would not burden you with a fee just now,” he said. “You may pay me when you have the money, or you may never pay me at all if you find it inconvenient. Sit here upon the couch, and let me have the whole story of your troubles.”She sat down, and I noticed that she shivered as she did so. “I shall be as brief as I can,” she said. “I am Helen Stoner, and I am living with my stepfather, who is the last survivor of one of the oldest Saxon families in England, the Roylotts of Stoke Moran, in Surrey. By the mother’s side I am a descendant of the ancient Huguenots, who have been settled in England for many centuries. There is a good deal of history attached to my family, both good and bad. There have been famous soldiers and sailors, but also some very wicked men. My stepfather is Dr. Grimesby Roylott. He was a medical man, but he gave up his practice when he inherited the family property. He is a man of very violent temper, and he has been known to commit acts of great brutality. He was married to my mother, who was a widow with two daughters, of whom I am the younger. My mother had a considerable fortune, which she left to my stepfather upon trust, that he should provide for us until we married. We lived in India for some years, where my stepfather had a large practice. He was a man of great strength and energy, but he was also a man of violent passions. In a fit of anger he beat his native butler to death and was sentenced to a long term of imprisonment. He served half of his sentence and then was released. He came back to England and married my mother. We lived in London for a short time, and then my mother died in a railway accident. My stepfather then took us to Stoke Moran, where he has lived ever since. He is a man of very peculiar habits. He has no friends, and he never goes out. He lives in a large, old house, which is surrounded by a park. He has a number of animals, which he has brought from India. He has a cheetah and a baboon, which run about the grounds. He is a man of great strength, and he is very violent when he is angry. He has been known to strike people with his fists. He is feared by everyone in the village. He has no servants, and he does everything for himself. My sister and I had to do all the housework. We had a very lonely life. We never saw anyone. We were not allowed to go out. We had no friends. My sister was two years older than I. She was a very beautiful girl. She was engaged to be married to a major in the marines, and she was to have been married in a fortnight. She died very suddenly. It was a terrible shock to me. I have never been the same since. I have been very nervous and depressed. I have had no one to talk to. I have been very lonely. I have been afraid to tell anyone about my fears. I have been afraid that they would think that I was mad. I have been afraid that they would not believe me. I have been afraid that they would laugh at me. I have been afraid that they would think that I was making it all up. I have been afraid that they would think that I was trying to get attention.

            "prefix-probing": "There is no vehicle save a dog-cart which throws up mud in that way, and then only when you sit on the left-hand side of the driver.”\n\nHolmes leaned back in his chair, a thin spiral of smoke curling lazily from his pipe towards the ceiling. He was regarding a pair of mud-splashed trousers that lay across the arm of the sofa with an air of profound concentration. I confess I had seen nothing remarkable about them, save that they were exceedingly dirty and of a rather coarse tweed. Our visitor, a Mr. Josiah Amberley, a man of some fifty years with a perpetually worried frown etched upon his face, sat opposite, twisting his hat nervously in his hands.\n\n“You see, Watson,” Holmes continued, turning his keen eyes upon me, “the angle and distribution of the mud are quite specific. Observe how the heaviest concentration is upon the left leg, particularly from the knee downwards, and how the splashes ascend in a fan-like pattern, diminishing in density as they rise. A carriage or a cab would throw mud differently, either lower down from the wheels or more evenly distributed if the road were deeply rutted. A bicycle would produce a fine spray, quite distinct from this heavy, viscous deposit. No, this is the work of a dog-cart, a vehicle with high wheels and a relatively open structure, driven at a fair pace over a very muddy road.”\n\n“But why the left side, Holmes?” I asked, genuinely puzzled. “Surely mud would be thrown up on both sides?”\n\n“Ah, there lies the refinement,” he said, a faint smile playing on his lips. “Consider the dynamics. The mud is thrown outwards and backwards from the wheels. If the road were uniformly muddy, one might expect splashes on both sides. But the preponderance on the left suggests that the source of the mud was primarily to the left of the vehicle's path. This could be due to several factors: a particularly deep puddle or rut on the left side of the track, or perhaps the driver was keeping deliberately to the right side of a narrow, muddy lane, forcing the left wheel through the worst of the mire. Given the nature of the splashes – heavy and clotted – I incline to the former explanation, a significant pool of mud struck by the left wheel. And the fact that Mr. Amberley’s left leg bears the brunt of it indicates he was seated on the left side of the dog-cart.”\n\nMr. Amberley, who had been listening with a mixture of awe and bewilderment, finally found his voice. “That is precisely correct, Mr. Holmes! I came from my estate near Reigate this morning. The roads are dreadful after the rain, and there is one particularly bad stretch just past the old mill where the lane dips. My driver, old Thomas, had to steer around a fallen branch, and the left wheel went right through a quagmire. I was indeed sitting on the left.”\n\n“Precisely,” said Holmes, as if the matter were now closed. He picked up the trousers again, examining the mud more closely. “And the mud itself tells a tale. Note its colour – a reddish-brown, characteristic of clay soil mixed with peat. This, combined with the presence of fine sand particles, suggests a specific geological area. Reigate, you say? Yes, that fits perfectly with the Greensand Ridge formation. Furthermore, the mud is still damp, though not soaking wet, indicating a journey completed within the last few hours, but not immediately before your arrival. You stopped somewhere on the way, Mr. Amberley?”\n\nThe client’s jaw dropped. “Good heavens, Mr. Holmes! You are a wizard! Yes, I stopped in Croydon for a bite of lunch and to make some enquiries before coming on to London. How could you possibly know that?”\n\n“The mud, my dear sir, the mud,” Holmes replied, laying the trousers aside. “It had begun to dry and cake in places, but the deeper layers were still moist. Had you come directly, it would have been uniformly wet. Had you stopped for a prolonged period, it would have been entirely dry. A few hours’ pause is consistent with the state of the deposit. But enough of these trivialities. You mentioned on your card that you have a matter of the utmost urgency and delicacy to discuss. Pray, tell us what has brought you to Baker Street in such a state of agitation, and with such muddy raiment.”\n\nMr. Amberley visibly pulled himself together, though his hands continued to tremble slightly. “It is about my son, Mr. Holmes. My only son, Arthur. He has disappeared.”\n\n“Disappeared?” Holmes’s eyes sharpened. “When did this occur?”\n\n“Three days ago. He left the house on Monday morning, saying he was going up to London on business. He is involved in some… speculative ventures in the City. He took a train from Reigate station. He was expected back on Tuesday evening, but he never returned. We have heard nothing.”\n\n“Have you contacted the police?” asked Holmes.\n\n“Yes, Mr. Holmes, I went to the local constabulary yesterday. They were sympathetic, but frankly, they seemed rather helpless. They said"

The manor-house is, as I have already said, very old, and only one wing is now inhabited. The bedrooms in this wing are on the ground floor, the sitting-rooms being in the central block of the buildings. Of these bedrooms the first is Dr. Roylott’s, the second my sister’s, and the third my own. There is no communication between them, but they all open out into the same corridor. Do I make myself plain?”\n“Perfectly so.”\n“The windows of the three rooms open out upon the lawn. That fatal night Dr. Roylott had gone to his room early, though we knew that he had not retired to rest, for my sister was troubled by the smell of the strong Indian cigars which it was his custom to smoke. She left her room, therefore, and came into mine, where she sat for some time, chatting about her approaching wedding. At eleven o’clock she rose to leave me, but she paused at the door and looked back.\n“‘Tell me, Helen,’ said she, ‘have you ever heard anyone whistle in the dead of the night?’\n“‘Never,’ said I.\n“‘I suppose that you could not possibly whistle, yourself, in your sleep?’\n“‘Certainly not. But why?’\n“‘Because during the last few nights I have always, about three in the morning, heard a low, clear whistle. I am a light sleeper, and it has awakened me. I cannot tell where it came from—perhaps from the next room, perhaps from the lawn. I thought that I would just ask you whether you had heard it.’\n“‘No, I have not. It must be those wretched gipsies in the plantation.’\n“‘Very likely. And yet if it were on the lawn, I wonder that you did not hear it also.’\n“‘Ah, but I sleep more heavily than you.’\n“‘Well, it is of no great consequence, at any rate.’ She smiled back at me, closed my door, and a few moments later I heard her key turn in the lock.”\n“Indeed,” said Holmes. “Was it your custom always to lock yourselves in at night?”\n“Always.”\n“And why?”\n“I think that I mentioned to you that the Doctor kept a cheetah and a baboon. We had no feeling of security unless our doors were locked.”\n“Quite so. Pray proceed with your statement.”\n“I could not sleep that night. A vague feeling of impending misfortune impressed me. My sister and I, you will recollect, were twins, and you know how subtle are the links which bind two souls which are so closely allied. It was a wild night. The wind was howling outside, and the rain was beating and splashing against the windows. Suddenly, amid all the hubbub of the gale, there burst forth the wild scream of a terrified woman. I knew that it was my sister’s voice. I sprang from my bed, wrapped a shawl round me, and rushed into the corridor. As I opened my door I seemed to hear a low whistle, such as my sister described, and a few moments later a clanging sound, as if a mass of metal had fallen. As I ran down the passage, my sister’s door was unlocked, and revolved slowly upon its hinges. I stared at it horror-stricken, not knowing what was about to issue from it. By the light of the corridor-lamp I saw my sister appear at the opening, her face blanched with terror, her hands groping for help, her whole figure swaying to and fro like that of a drunkard. I ran to her and threw my arms round her, but at that moment her knees seemed to give way and she fell to the ground. She writhed as one who is in terrible pain, and her limbs were dreadfully convulsed. At first I thought that she had not recognised me, but as I bent over her she suddenly shrieked out in a voice which I shall never forget, ‘Oh, my God! Helen! It was the band! The speckled band!’ There was something else which she would fain have said, and she stabbed with her finger into the air in the direction of the Doctor’s room, but a fresh convulsion seized her and choked her words. I rushed out, calling loudly for my stepfather, and I met him hastening from his room in his dressing-gown. When he reached my sister’s side she was unconscious, and though he poured brandy down her throat and sent for medical aid from the village, all efforts were in vain, for she slowly sank and died without having recovered her consciousness. Such was the dreadful end of my beloved sister.”\n“One moment,” said Holmes, “are you sure about this whistle and metallic sound? Could you swear to it?”\n“That was what the county coroner asked me at the inquiry. It is my strong impression that I heard it, and yet, among the crash of the gale and the creaking of an old house, I may possibly have been deceived.”\n“Was your sister dressed?”\n“No, she was in her night-dress. In her right hand was found the charred stump of a match, and in her left a match-box.”\n“Showing that she had struck a light and looked about her when the alarm took place. That is important. And what conclusions did the coroner come to?”\n“He investigated the case with great care, for Dr. Roylott’s conduct had long been notorious in the county, but he was unable to find any satisfactory cause of death. My evidence showed that the door had been fastened upon the inner side, and the windows were blocked by old-fashioned shutters with broad iron bars, which were secured every night. The walls were carefully sounded, and were shown to be quite solid all round, and the flooring was also thoroughly examined, with the same result. The chimney is wide, but is barred up by four large staples. It is certain, therefore, that my sister was quite alone when she met her end. Besides, there were no marks of any violence upon her.”\n“How about poison?”\n“The doctors examined her for it, but without success.”\n“What do you think that this unfortunate lady died of, then?”\n“It is my belief that she died of pure fear and nervous shock, though what it was that frightened her I cannot imagine.”\n“Were there gipsies in the plantation at the time?”\n“Yes, there are nearly always some there.”\n“Ah, and what did you gather from this allusion to a band—a speckled band?”\n“Sometimes I have thought that it was merely the wild talk of delirium, sometimes that it may have referred to some band of people, perhaps to these very gipsies in the plantation. I do not know whether the spotted handkerchiefs which so many of them wear over their heads might have suggested the strange adjective which she used.”\nHolmes shook his head like a man who is far from being satisfied.",

The walls were carefully sounded, and the floor was examined. They had suspicions at first of some poison, but the doctors declared that there was no trace of such a thing. \" \"Then a coroner's inquest was held?\" \"Yes, on the same day. A jury sat, and a verdict of accidental death was given. There was further inquiry, but nothing was ever found to throw a light upon the matter. And so it stands now.\" \"Have you any theory yourself as to what this 'speckled band' could be?\" \"Only that it must have been the gipsies. Some of these creatures are always camping on our lawn, and they are forever wandering to and fro in the passages. I used to hate and fear them when I was a child. I am sure that it must have been some gipsy who did it. \" \"I see. And what did you do then?\" \"I could not live in that room any longer. I was afraid to go back to it.

The doctors Mr. Dwyer, a venerable old man, and Mr. Armitage, a younger one, who had been my father's friends for many years were there, and Dr. Roylott joined them. They examined the room minutely. The walls were carefully sounded, and the floor was examined. They had suspicions at first of some poison, but the doctors declared that there was no trace of such a thing. \" \"Then a coroner's inquest was held?\" \"Yes, on the same day. A jury sat, and a verdict of accidental death was given. There was further inquiry, but nothing was ever found to throw a light upon the matter. And so it stands now.\" \"Have you any theory yourself as to what this 'speckled band' could be?\" \"Only that it must have been the gipsies. Some of these creatures are always camping on our lawn, and they are forever wandering to and fro in the passages. I used to hate and fear them when I was a child. I am sure that it must have been some gipsy who did it. \" \"I see. And what did you do then?\" \"I could not live in that room any longer. I was afraid to go back to it. So for three years I have been sleeping in the room which my sister used to occupy the room in which she died. \" \"You have not met with anything to alarm you in that room?\" \"No. But now within the last few nights I have heard the same gentle whistling sound. I have heard it within the last two nights, Mr. Holmes, and on both occasions about three in the morning. I do not use my sister's room, but I sleep in my own, and I am always awakened by the sound. I have not dared to tell my stepfather, but I have been in a dreadful state of alarm. \" \"You say that your sister was on the eve of her marriage when she died. Was she engaged to be married?\" \"Yes, sir. She was engaged to Major Prendergast, of the Royal Marines. \" \"My God, Watson, here we are back at the old question of the marriage. Was there any other point which impressed you?\" \"Nothing, sir, save that a few days before her death she had been very much disturbed by the smell of the strong Indian cigars which Dr. Roylott smokes. \" \"Ah, indeed! That is a point which may be of importance. It is possible that it may be connected with the smell which you have noticed yourself. \" \"I do not think so, sir. I have never smelled it myself. \" \"Well, at any rate, it is a point which we shall not forget. You say that you have heard this whistling sound for the last two nights. Have you heard it before?\" \"No, sir. It is only within the last two nights that I have heard it. \" \"And you say that your sister heard it before her death?\" \"Yes, sir. She told me so herself. \" \"And how long ago was that?\" \"It was only a few nights before her death. I think that it was about a week. \" \"And she heard it about three in the morning?\" \"Yes, sir. She said that she had been awakened by it. \" \"And you have heard it about the same hour?\" \"Yes, sir. \" \"And you say that you have not dared to tell your stepfather?\" \"No, sir. I have been afraid to do so. \" \"My God, Watson, this is a most extraordinary case. What do you think of it?\" \"I confess that I am at a loss. It is certainly a most singular business. \" \"Well, we shall see. Pray continue your statement, Miss Stoner. \" \"I have told you all that I know, sir. I have nothing more to add. \" \"Not at all, Miss Stoner. You have told us a great deal. You have told us that your sister was on the eve of her marriage, that she heard a whistling sound about three in the morning, that she died suddenly and inexplicably, that she shrieked out 'the speckled band' at the moment of her death, and that there was no trace of violence or poison. These are all important facts. \" \"But what do you make of it, sir?\" \"That is just what I am trying to find out. Pray tell me, Miss Stoner, did your sister ever mention the speckled band before?\" \"No, sir. Never. \" \"And you have no idea what it could be?\" \"None, sir. \" \"Then we must try to find out. Pray tell me, Miss Stoner, what is the exact position of your room and your sister's room?\" \"They are on the ground floor, sir, and they both open out into the corridor. There is no communication between them. \" \"And your stepfather's room?\" \"It is next to my sister's room. \" \"So that your sister's room is between yours and your stepfather's?\" \"Yes, sir. \" \"And you say that you always lock your doors at night?\" \"Yes, sir. We are obliged to do so on account of the cheetah and the baboon. \" \"The cheetah and the baboon!\" cried I. \"Yes, sir. They are allowed to wander about the grounds at night, and we are afraid of them. \" \"I see. And you say that your sister locked her door on the night of her death?\" \"Yes, sir. She always did. \" \"And you heard her lock it?\" \"Yes, sir. I heard the key turn in the lock. \" \"And you say that you heard a whistling sound and a metallic clang?\" \"Yes, sir. \" \"And you say that you rushed out into the corridor?\" \"Yes, sir. \" \"And you found your sister's door unlocked?\" \"Yes, sir. \" \"And you saw her emerge?\" \"Yes, sir. \" \"And she shriek",

A month ago, however, a dear friend, whom I have known for many years, has done me the honour to ask my hand in marriage. His name is Armitage—Percy Armitage—the second son of Mr. Armitage, of Crane Water, near Reading. My stepfather has offered no opposition to the match, and we are to be married in the course of the spring. Two days ago some repairs were started in the west wing of the building, and my bedroom wall has been pierced, so that I have had to move into the chamber in which my sister died, and to sleep in the very bed in which she slept. Imagine, then, my thrill of terror when last night, as I lay awake, thinking over her terrible fate, I suddenly heard in the silence of the night the low whistle which had been the herald of her own death. I sprang up and lit the lamp, but nothing was to be seen in the room. I was too shaken to go to bed again, however, so I dressed, and as soon as it was daylight I slipped down, got a dog-cart at the Crown Inn, which is opposite, and drove to Leatherhead, from whence I have come on this morning with the one object of seeing you and asking your advice.”\n“You have done wisely,” said my friend. “But have you told me all?”\n“Yes, all.”\n“Miss Roylott, you have not. You are screening your stepfather.”\n“Why, what do you mean?”\nFor answer Holmes pushed back the frill of black lace which fringed the hand that lay upon our visitor’s knee. Five little livid spots, the marks of four fingers and a thumb, were printed upon the white wrist.\n“You have been cruelly used,” said Holmes.\nThe lady coloured deeply and covered over her injured wrist. “He is a hard man,” she said, “and perhaps he hardly knows his own strength.”\nThere was a long silence, during which Holmes leaned his chin upon his hands and stared into the crackling fire.\n“This is a very deep business,” he said at last. “There are a thousand details which I should desire to know before I decide upon our course of action. Yet we have not a moment to lose. If we were to come to Stoke Moran to-day, would it be possible for us to see over these rooms without the knowledge of your stepfather?”\n“As it happens, he spoke of coming into town to-day upon some most important business. It is probable that he will be away all day, and that there would be nothing to disturb you. We have a housekeeper now, but she is old and foolish, and I could easily get her out of the way.”\n“Excellent. You are not averse to this trip, Watson?”\n“By no means.”\n“Then we shall both come. What are you going to do yourself?”\n“I have one or two things which I would wish to do now that I am in town. But I shall return by the twelve o’clock train, so as to be there in time for your coming.”\n“And you may expect us early in the afternoon. I have myself some small business matters to attend to. Will you not wait and breakfast?”\n“No, I must go. My heart is lightened already since I have confided my trouble to you. I shall look forward to seeing you again this afternoon.” She dropped her thick black veil over her face and glided from the room.",

The house is a large one, but it stands in very extensive grounds, and for a long time there was no one to come near us. We had ceased to visit, and were very seldom visited. A couple of months ago, however, a dear friend, whom I have known for many years, came to stay at Stoke Moran, and made a considerable stay there. His name is Percy Armitage—the second son of Mr. Armitage, of Crane Water, near Reading. He is a man of character and position, and a charming companion. My relations with him became very intimate, and in a fortnight’s time he asked me to marry him. My stepfather made no objection whatever. He appeared to be rather pleased at the prospect, and personally I felt that I should be happier for a change.\n\n“Two days ago some repairs were started in the west wing of the house. The wall of my bedroom was pierced, and it was impossible to sleep there any longer. I was obliged to move into the room in which my sister died, and to sleep in the very bed which she had occupied. Think of my feelings, Mr. Holmes, when I found myself in so dreadful a situation! I could not sleep, as you may imagine. I lay awake, thinking of her terrible fate. Presently my mind wandered to the other incidents which had occurred in the room. The whistle! The low, clear whistle which she had heard ere she died! I fell into a light doze, and then suddenly I was aroused by the sound of that same whistle. It seemed to come from the wall just beside my bed. It was a low, clear sound, but quite distinct, and it seemed to come from the direction of the ventilator. I sprang up, lit my lamp, and as I did so I heard the creaking of a door and the sound of a low whistle. I was so terrified that I could not think. I dressed myself at once, and as soon as it was dawn I slipped down, got a dog-cart at the ‘Crown Inn,’ which is only a few minutes’ drive, and came straight to you. I have driven through the night, Mr. Holmes, and I am weary and shaken.”\n\nShe had told her story with great spirit and animation, but at this point she broke down and sobbed convulsively.\n\n“It is fearful,” said she, “to be in the hands of such a man. I do not know what to do, nor how to act.”\n\n“You are quite right to come to me,” said Holmes. “Your case is a very interesting one, and I shall be happy to give you any assistance in my power. You have told me all, have you not?”\n\n“I think so.”\n\n“Nothing you have omitted which might throw a light upon the case?”\n\n“Nothing which I can recall.”\n\n“You must not fear to tell me that which you know,” said Holmes, kindly. “I see that you have not told me all. You are shielding your stepfather.”\n\n“Why, what do you mean?” she cried.\n\nFor answer Holmes pushed up the sleeve of her dress, and there, sure enough, were five livid spots, the marks of four fingers and a thumb.\n\n“You have been cruelly used,” said Holmes.\n\nShe coloured deeply and covered over her arm. “He is a hard man,” she said, “and perhaps he does not know his own strength.”\n\nThere was a long silence, during which Holmes sat in an armchair with his chin upon his hands, lost in thought.\n\n“This is a very deep business,” said he at last. “There is a great deal in it that is not clear.

I shall be very happy to do so.”\n\n“You are most kind,” said she. “I have no doubt that you will be able to clear the matter up. But what about my stepfather? He is a man of a very violent temper, and I should not like him to know that you are there.”\n\n“I shall manage that,” said Holmes. “I shall go down with you as your medical adviser. Watson here will accompany me. We shall be able to see the rooms without his knowledge. He will be in town all day, will he not?”\n\n“He will be in town all day, and I can manage the housekeeper. She is an old servant of my mother’s, and is devoted to me.”\n\n“Excellent,” said Holmes. “We shall be there by midday. You can run any errands that you have in town, and we shall meet you at the station.”\n\n“You are most kind,” said she. “I have no doubt that you will be able to clear the matter up.” She rose as she spoke, and Holmes rose also.\n\n“I shall be ready at any time,” said he.\n\n“You will not wish to have any breakfast before you go?”\n\n“No, I shall not wish to have any breakfast.”\n\n“Then I shall go at once.” She left the room, and Holmes and I were left alone.\n\n“Well, Watson,” said Holmes, “what do you think of it?”\n\n“It is a very strange case,” said I.\n\n“It is a very strange case indeed,” said he. “There is a great deal in it that is not clear.

As I was saying, Arthur – that is, Mr. Arthur Stanhope – was the kindest, most honourable man I have ever known. We were to be married next month. Everything was arranged. He was in excellent spirits, looking forward to our life together. There was not a cloud in the sky, or so I thought.”\n\nI paused, remembering the day everything changed. “It was last Tuesday. A telegram arrived in the morning. Arthur took it in the hall. I was in the drawing-room, arranging flowers. I heard him give a sharp intake of breath. When he came in, his face was pale, and his brow furrowed with a look of profound anxiety I had never seen before. He crumpled the telegram in his hand.”\n\n“He said it was from his uncle, Sir Reginald Stanhope, requesting his immediate presence at the family estate in Sussex. Sir Reginald is an old man, somewhat of a recluse, and Arthur rarely visited him. The message itself seemed innocuous enough – something about urgent family business. But Arthur’s reaction… it was as if he had received a death warrant.”\n\n“He was agitated, restless. He packed a small bag hastily, saying he would take the afternoon train and would be back within two days at the most. He kissed me goodbye, but his mind seemed miles away. He promised to write or telegraph as soon as he arrived, but I have heard nothing, Mr. Holmes. Not a single word.”\n\n“At first, I told myself there must be a simple explanation. Perhaps Sir Reginald was truly ill, and Arthur was needed to manage affairs. But two days passed, then three, then a week. My anxiety grew unbearable. I telegraphed Sir Reginald’s estate myself. The reply I received was brief and chilling. It stated simply that Mr. Arthur Stanhope had not arrived there.”\n\n“I was frantic. I contacted Arthur’s parents in Yorkshire. They were strangely evasive. His mother wept, but his father, a stern, unyielding man, merely said that Arthur was on ‘important business’ and could not be disturbed. He refused to tell me where this business was or when he might return. He even implied that my inquiries were unwelcome and that I should simply wait patiently.”\n\n“Wait patiently! When the man I love has vanished into thin air? I knew then that something was terribly wrong"

It is precisely for that reason that we are going to Stoke Moran this day. I want to see whether the objections are fatal, or if they may be explained away. But what in the name of the devil!”\nThe ejaculation had been drawn from my companion by the fact that our door had been suddenly dashed open, and that a huge man had framed himself in the aperture. His costume was a peculiar mixture of the professional and of the agricultural, having a black top-hat, a long frock-coat, and a pair of high gaiters, with a hunting-crop swinging in his hand. So tall was he that his hat actually brushed the cross bar of the doorway, and his breadth seemed to span it across from side to side. A large face, seared with a thousand wrinkles, burned yellow with the sun, and marked with every evil passion, was turned from one to the other of us, while his deep-set, bile-shot eyes, and his high, thin, fleshless nose, gave him somewhat the resemblance to a fierce old bird of prey.\n“Which of you is Holmes?” asked this apparition.\n“My name, sir; but you have the advantage of me,” said my companion quietly.\n“I am Dr. Grimesby Roylott, of Stoke Moran.”\n“Indeed, Doctor,” said Holmes blandly. “Pray take a seat.”\n“I will do nothing of the kind. My stepdaughter has been here. I have traced her. What has she been saying to you?”\n“It is a little cold for the time of the year,” said Holmes.\n“What has she been saying to you?” screamed the old man furiously.\n“But I have heard that the crocuses promise well,” continued my companion imperturbably.\n“Ha! You put me off, do you?” said our new visitor, taking a step forward and shaking his hunting-crop. “I know you, you scoundrel! I have heard of you before. You are Holmes, the meddler.”\nMy friend smiled.\n“Holmes, the busybody!”\nHis smile broadened.\n“Holmes, the Scotland Yard Jack-in-office!”\nHolmes chuckled heartily. “Your conversation is most entertaining,” said he. “When you go out close the door, for there is a decided draught.”\n“I will go when I have had my say. Don’t you dare to meddle with my affairs. I know that Miss Stoner has been here. I traced her! I am a dangerous man to fall foul of! See here.” He stepped swiftly forward, seized the poker, and bent it into a curve with his huge brown hands.\n“See that you keep yourself out of my grip,” he snarled, and hurling the twisted poker into the fireplace he strode out of the room.\n“He seems a very amiable person,” said Holmes, laughing. “I am not quite so bulky, but if he had remained I might have shown him that my grip was not much more feeble than his own.” As he spoke he picked up the steel poker and, with a sudden effort, straightened it out again.\n“Fancy his having the insolence to confound me with the official detective force! This incident gives zest to our investigation, however, and I only trust that our little friend will not suffer from her imprudence in allowing this brute to trace her. And now, Watson, we shall order breakfast, and afterwards I shall walk down to Doctors’ Commons, where I hope to get some data which may help us in this matter.”",

I should at least like to have it firmly established that the gipsy camp with whom the doctor was upon such intimate terms had some movable beast or other in their possession. I have noted, in my experience of crime, that the most commonplace action is often the most mysterious, and that the most mysterious often proves to be commonplace. Hence, I attach great importance to the fact that this lady, who was of a retiring, silent disposition, should have blurted out so singular a phrase. Did it strike you at all?” “I confess that I can make nothing of it.” “Nor I. I confess that my head is completely puzzled by it. It is possible that the words are merely the wild ravings of a dying woman. We must not build too much upon them. But what do you make of the metallic clang, and of the lady’s remark that she heard her sister open the shutter?” “It was a common casement, and I should think that she would very likely open it to bring in her sister when she heard her cry.” “That is possible. But is it probable? When you consider the violence of her scream, the suddenness of her death, and the singular words which she uttered, I do not think that they point to a simple natural cause. And here we come back to the whistles at night.” “What is your theory, then, as to the cause of death?” “I have none. I confess that my mind is utterly bewildered. From the time that I heard the lady’s story I have been conscious of a vague sense of impending misfortune, and of evil lurking near her. I have already told you that I can see a possible connection between the whistles, the gipsies, the man’s violent character, and the lady’s death, but it is a connection which I cannot see my way to prove. At present I can only say that there is a mystery about the matter which I can by no means explain.” “What is to be done, then?” “I shall wire to Dr. Roylott and ask him for an interview.” “But he is a most violent man.” “I know it. But I must see him. I must see him at once. I shall go down to Stoke Moran this afternoon.” “And I?” “You must come with me. I should be glad of your company.” “It is a most serious business.” “It is. I have never had a more difficult case to handle.” “I am glad that I am with you.” “And I am glad that you are with me. We shall go down to Stoke Moran this afternoon. I shall wire to Dr. Roylott at once.” He rose and went to the writing-table. As he did so the door burst open, and a huge man, framed in the doorway, stood before us. His dress was a mixture of the professional and the agricultural. He wore a long black frock-coat, and a high hat, but his trousers were tucked into his high boots, and he carried a hunting-crop in his hand. He was a man of immense size, and of great strength. His face was large, seamed, and hard-featured, with a cruel, sensuous mouth, and a pair of piercing grey eyes, which were sunk deep in his head. He was a man of fifty, but his hair was streaked with grey, and his face was deeply lined. He was a man whom it would be dangerous to cross. “Which of you is Holmes?” he asked in a deep, harsh voice. “My name, sir, is Sherlock Holmes,” said my companion, quietly. “I presume that you are Dr. Grimesby Roylott.” “I am,” said the man, curtly. “I have come to see you, Mr. Holmes, because I hear that you have been prying into my affairs.” “I have been consulted by your stepdaughter, Miss Helen Stoner,” said Holmes. “She has told me that she has been much troubled by you.” “She has, has she?” cried the doctor, furiously. “She has been telling you some of her lies, has she? She has been complaining of me, has she? I will tell you this, Mr. Holmes, that I am a dangerous man to play with. I am a dangerous man to cross. I am a dangerous man to meddle with. Do you hear me?” “I hear you, sir,” said Holmes, calmly. “I have no wish to meddle with you. I have only been consulted by your stepdaughter, and I have given her such advice as I thought best.” “You have, have you?” roared the doctor. “You have been advising her, have you? You have been telling her to leave me, have you? You have been telling her to marry, have you? You have been telling her to claim her money, have you? You have been telling her to defy me, have you? I will tell you this, Mr. Holmes, that if you do not drop this matter at once, you will find that you have made the greatest mistake of your life.” He took a step forward, and shook his hunting-crop at Holmes. “I will not be dictated to by you,” said Holmes. “I will not be threatened by you. I will not be bullied by you. I will not be intimidated by you. I will not be frightened by you. I will not be moved by you. I will not be influenced by you. I will not be persuaded by you. I will not be turned by you. I will not be stopped by you. I will not be prevented by you. I will not be hindered by you. I will not be delayed by you. I will not be kept by you.

          "text_segment": "It was nearly one o’clock when Sherlock Holmes returned from his excursion. He held in his hand a sheet of blue paper, scrawled over with notes and figures.\n“I have seen the will of the deceased wife,” said he. “To determine its exact meaning I have been obliged to work out the present prices of the investments with which it is concerned. The total income, which at the time of the wife’s death was little short of £ 1,100, is now, through the fall in agricultural prices, not more than £ 750. Each daughter can claim an income of £ 250, in case of marriage. It is evident, therefore, that if both girls had married, this beauty would have had a mere pittance, while even one of them would cripple him to a very serious extent. My morning’s work has not been wasted, since it has proved that he has the very strongest motives for standing in the way of anything of the sort. And now, Watson, this is too serious for dawdling, especially as the old man is aware that we are interesting ourselves in his affairs; so if you are ready, we shall call a cab and drive to Waterloo. I should be very much obliged if you would slip your revolver into your pocket. An Eley’s No. 2 is an excellent argument with gentlemen who can twist steel pokers into knots. That and a tooth-brush are, I think, all that we need.”\nAt Waterloo we were fortunate in catching a train for Leatherhead, where we hired a trap at the station inn and drove for four or five miles through the lovely Surrey lanes. It was a perfect day, with a bright sun and a few fleecy clouds in the heavens. The trees and wayside hedges were just throwing out their first green shoots, and the air was full of the pleasant smell of the moist earth. To me at least there was a strange contrast between the sweet promise of the spring and this sinister quest upon which we were engaged. My companion sat in the front of the trap, his arms folded, his hat pulled down over his eyes, and his chin sunk upon his breast, buried in the deepest thought. Suddenly, however, he started, tapped me on the shoulder, and pointed over the meadows.\n“Look there!” said he.\nA heavily timbered park stretched up in a gentle slope, thickening into a grove at the highest point. From amid the branches there jutted out the grey gables and high roof-tree of a very old mansion.\n“Stoke Moran?” said he.\n“Yes, sir, that be the house of Dr. Grimesby Roylott,” remarked the driver.\n“There is some building going on there,” said Holmes; “that is where we are going.”\n“There’s the village,” said the driver, pointing to a cluster of roofs some distance to the left; “but if you want to get to the house, you’ll find it shorter to get over this stile, and so by the footpath over the fields. There it is, where the lady is walking.”\n“And the lady, I fancy, is Miss Stoner,” observed Holmes, shading his eyes. “Yes, I think we had better do as you suggest.”\nWe got off, paid our fare, and the trap rattled back on its way to Leatherhead.\n“I thought it as well,” said Holmes as we climbed the stile, “that this fellow should think we had come here as architects, or on some definite business. It may stop his gossip. Good-afternoon, Miss Stoner. You see that we have been as good as our word.”\nOur client of the morning had hurried forward to meet us with a face which spoke her joy. “I have been waiting so eagerly for you,” she cried, shaking hands with us warmly. “All has turned out splendidly. Dr. Roylott has gone to town, and it is unlikely that he will be back before evening.”\n“We have had the pleasure of making the Doctor’s acquaintance,” said Holmes, and in a few words he sketched out what had occurred. Miss Stoner turned white to the lips as she listened.\n“Good heavens!” she cried, “he has followed me, then.”\n“So it appears.”\n“He is so cunning that I never know when I am safe from him. What will he say when he returns?”\n“He must guard himself, for he may find that there is someone more cunning than himself upon his track. You must lock yourself up from him to-night. If he is violent, we shall take you away to your aunt’s at Harrow. Now, we must make the best use of our time, so kindly take us at once to the rooms which we are to examine.”",

              "simple_agent_extraction": "It was nearly one o’clock when Sherlock Holmes returned from his excursion. He had spent the whole of the morning in the Old Bond Street Registry, and had extracted the will of the deceased wife of Dr. Grimesby Roylott. “Here is the document, Watson,” said he. “I have skimmed the cream from it. You can peruse the rest at your leisure. I may say, however, that from our point of view there is nothing of importance in it save the one clause dealing with the disposition of the lady’s money. It is drawn out in strict accordance with her marriage settlement, which I have also seen, and provides that the considerable income of the estate is to be divided into equal portions, between the mother and the two daughters, and that on the marriage of either daughter the entire income from her share is Dr. Roylott’s. As it is thirty years since this will was made, the lady’s fortune will, of course, be greatly increased during the interval, and a considerable sum of ready money, besides the annual income, had accumulated. It is absolutely certain that a large sum of money is waiting in the bank for this amiable gentleman in the event of the marriage of either of his stepdaughters.”\n“But, my dear Holmes, what a very extraordinary sequence of events! We knew of his violent character, and his high temper, but what in the world could have been his motives for deliberately murdering this poor girl? That he had the knowledge of the poison will only complicate matters, for it proves his guilty knowledge.”\n“Well, my dear Watson, you must not build up a theory in anticipation of the facts. The facts themselves may prove to be quite different from what you imagine. We have not yet got our feet upon the ground in this case. Let us take the will, and see what it says.” He spread it out upon the table, and we both bent over it. “Here you see that the income of the estate is seventy-five hundred pounds. This is divided into three equal parts, and the mother and daughters each have twenty-five hundred. When the mother died, I see that it was provided that the income of the estate should be divided between the daughters, and that on the marriage of either of them, the entire income of her share should go to Dr. Roylott. It is clear, therefore, that if both girls had married, he would have had the full seven thousand five hundred pounds. If one had married, he would have had five thousand pounds, and if neither had married, he would have had only twenty-five hundred pounds. It is evident, therefore, that the more marriages there were, the less money he would have. Now, when the poor girl died, he was left with only one stepdaughter, and her marriage would have cost him twenty-five hundred pounds a year. Was it not natural, therefore, that he should do all that he could to prevent her from marrying?”\n“I see it all now,” I cried. “It is as clear as possible.”\n“Well, then, Watson, we must not lose an instant. This fellow would not hesitate to do the same thing to Miss Helen as he did to her sister. We must be up and doing, or we shall be too late. Have you your revolver?”\n“I have.”\n“Then put it in your pocket. You may find it useful. We are going down to Stoke Moran at once. We shall take the train to Leatherhead, and then hire a trap to drive us to Stoke Moran. We must be careful, for this fellow is a desperate man, and he knows that we are on his track. He will not hesitate to do anything to prevent us from interfering with him.”\nWe were soon in the train, and in little more than an hour we were at Leatherhead. We hired a trap, and drove off through the beautiful Surrey lanes. It was a lovely spring day, and the country was at its best. The hedges were green, and the trees were in full leaf. The air was sweet with the smell of the hawthorn, and the song of the birds was in our ears. But our thoughts were far away from the beauty of the scene. We were on a mission of life and death, and the shadow of the gallows seemed to fall upon us as we drove along.\n“There is Stoke Moran,” said Holmes, pointing to a large house which stood in a park on the side of a hill. “It is a fine old place, but it looks rather dilapidated.”\n“It is a lonely spot,” I said. “There is no other house near it.”\n“That is all the better for us,” said Holmes. “We shall be less likely to be observed.”\nAs we drove up to the gate, a man came out and stood in the road. He was a tall, thin man, with a sallow face and a hooked nose. He had a long, grey beard, and his eyes were small and close together. He was dressed in a suit of black, and he wore a tall hat. He looked like a country doctor.\n“Good morning, gentlemen,” said he. “Are you going to Stoke Moran?”\n“Yes,” said Holmes. “We are going to see Dr. Roylott.”\n“I am Dr. Roylott,” said the man. “What do you want with me?”\n“We have come to see you on business,” said Holmes. “We are architects, and we have been asked to look at the house with a view to making some alterations.”\n“Oh, indeed,” said Dr. Roylott. “Well, you can come in and look at it. But I warn you that I am not going to spend any money on it.”\nHe opened the gate, and we drove in. As we went up the drive, we saw a young lady walking in the garden. She was a tall, graceful girl, with a sweet face and a gentle expression. She was dressed in a light-coloured dress, and she wore a straw hat. She looked like a lady.\n“That is my stepdaughter,” said Dr. Roylott. “She is not very well.”\nWe got out of the trap, and Dr. Roylott led us into the house. It was a large, old-fashioned house, with a wide hall and a broad staircase. The rooms were large and lofty, but they were poorly furnished and looked neglected. There were a number of stuffed animals on the walls, and a large collection of snakes and lizards in glass cases. The air was heavy with the smell of tobacco and the odour of some strong drug.\n“This is the drawing-room,” said Dr. Roylott. “You can look at it if you like.”\nWe went into the drawing-room. It was a large",

But I warn you that I am not going to spend any money on it.”\nHe opened the gate, and we drove in. As we went up the drive, we saw a young lady walking in the garden. She was a tall, graceful girl, with a sweet face and a gentle expression. She was dressed in a light-coloured dress, and she wore a straw hat. She looked like a lady.\n“That is my stepdaughter,” said Dr. Roylott. “She is not very well.”\nWe got out of the trap, and Dr. Roylott led us into the house. It was a large, old-fashioned house, with a wide hall and a broad staircase. The rooms were large and lofty, but they were poorly furnished and looked neglected. There were a number of stuffed animals on the walls, and a large collection of snakes and lizards in glass cases. The air was heavy with the smell of tobacco and the odour of some strong drug.\n“This is the drawing-room,” said Dr. Roylott. “You can look at it if you like.”\nWe went into the drawing-room.

            "prefix-probing": "It was nearly one o’clock when Sherlock Holmes returned from his excursion. I had spent the intervening hours in a state of restless anticipation, pacing the sitting-room and attempting, with little success, to immerse myself in a volume of Carlyle. The case of Miss Mary Sutherland, the unfortunate young woman whose fiancé had vanished on the very morning of their wedding, had taken a peculiar hold upon my imagination. Holmes had left shortly after her departure, promising to make some inquiries, and I knew that his return would bring either the dawn of understanding or a deeper plunge into the perplexing mystery.\n\nHe entered the room with a brisk step, though his face wore a thoughtful, almost abstracted expression. His deerstalker hat was pushed back upon his head, and his coat was dusted with the fine grey powder of the London streets. He carried a small, worn notebook in one hand and a magnifying glass in the other. He threw himself into his armchair, stretched out his long legs, and emitted a sigh that seemed to carry the weight of his morning’s labours.\n\n“Well, Holmes?” I prompted, unable to contain my impatience any longer. “Have you made any progress? Have you discovered the fate of Mr. Hosmer Angel?”\n\nHe closed his eyes for a moment, then opened them and fixed them upon the ceiling. “Progress, my dear Watson, is a relative term. I have certainly gathered information. Whether that information constitutes ‘progress’ towards a satisfactory conclusion remains to be seen.”\n\n“But you have learned something?”\n\n“Oh, undoubtedly. I have learned, for instance, that Mr. Hosmer Angel was a creature of habit, meticulous in his correspondence, and possessed of a handwriting that would do credit to a copperplate engraver. I have learned that he wore boots with square toes and a peculiar patch on the sole of the left one. I have learned that he smoked strong, dark tobacco and that he was, in the opinion of his landlady, a quiet and respectable gentleman, though she saw little of him.”\n\n“These details are interesting, Holmes, but do they shed any light on his disappearance?”\n\n“Every detail, Watson, however seemingly insignificant, may shed light upon a case. The difficulty lies in knowing which details are significant and which are merely part of the background noise of existence. I have also visited the office of Messrs. Cross & Blackwell, the solicitors mentioned by Miss Sutherland. I spoke with the senior partner, a Mr. Windibank, and his stepdaughter, Miss Sutherland herself.”\n\n“You saw Miss Sutherland again?” I asked, surprised.\n\n“Yes. It was necessary to verify certain points. I found her, as before, a most amiable and truthful young woman, though perhaps a trifle naive. Mr. Windibank, on the other hand, is a man of a different stamp. Sharp features, restless eyes, and a certain evasiveness in his manner when the subject of Hosmer Angel was introduced. He professed complete ignorance of the man, save for the fact that he had corresponded with Miss Sutherland through their office.”\n\n“And you believe him?”\n\nHolmes smiled faintly. “My dear Watson, it is seldom wise to believe implicitly the first statement made by anyone involved in a mystery. People have their reasons for concealment. Mr. Windibank’s reasons, I suspect, are connected to his rather stringent views on marriage, particularly for his stepdaughter, who possesses a considerable income from her mother’s estate. He admitted as much to Miss Sutherland, stating that he would prefer her to remain single.”\n\n“So you think he might have somehow prevented the marriage?”\n\n“The thought has certainly crossed my mind. The peculiar circumstances of the courtship – the letters delivered only through the office, the meetings only when Mr. Windibank was away, the thick veil worn by Hosmer Angel – all point to a deliberate effort at concealment. But concealment by whom? And for what purpose? That is the knot we must untangle.”\n\nHe rose and walked to the window, looking out at the bustling street below. “I have also made inquiries at the address given by Hosmer Angel in his letters – 16, Lyon Place. It is a respectable boarding-house. The landlady confirmed that a gentleman named Hosmer Angel had indeed rented a room there for some months. He was, she said, a quiet man who worked as a copyist. He paid his rent regularly, but was rarely in during the day. He left on the morning of the wedding, stating he would be away for a few days, and has not returned.”\n\n“And his belongings?”\n\n“Still there. A trunk, a few books, some clothes. Nothing that gives any immediate clue to his identity or whereabouts. However,” Holmes turned back to me, a spark of excitement in his eyes, “I did find something of interest. Among his papers was a small, folded sheet. It was a receipt from a theatrical costumier for the hire of a suit of clothes – a dark frock-coat, trousers, and a top hat. The date on the receipt is the day before the disappearance.”\n\n“A theatrical costume?” I frowned. “What could that signify?”\n\n“It signifies, Watson, that Mr. Hosmer Angel may not be quite the quiet copyist he presented himself as. It suggests a disguise, a role being played. Coupled with the thick veil, the peculiar hours, the correspondence through the office… it begins to paint a picture, albeit a hazy one, of a man who wished to remain unseen, unknown, perhaps even untraceable.”\n\nHe picked up his magnifying glass again and examined the receipt closely. “The address of the costumier is also noted. I shall pay them a visit this afternoon"

          "text_segment": "The building was of grey, lichen-blotched stone, with a high central portion and two curving wings, like the claws of a crab, thrown out on each side. In one of these wings the windows were broken and blocked with wooden boards, while the roof was partly caved in, a picture of ruin. The central portion was in little better repair, but the right-hand block was comparatively modern, and the blinds in the windows, with the blue smoke curling up from the chimneys, showed that this was where the family resided. Some scaffolding had been erected against the end wall, and the stone-work had been broken into, but there were no signs of any workmen at the moment of our visit. Holmes walked slowly up and down the ill-trimmed lawn and examined with deep attention the outsides of the windows.\n“This, I take it, belongs to the room in which you used to sleep, the centre one to your sister’s, and the one next to the main building to Dr. Roylott’s chamber?”\n“Exactly so. But I am now sleeping in the middle one.”\n“Pending the alterations, as I understand. By the way, there does not seem to be any very pressing need for repairs at that end wall.”\n“There were none. I believe that it was an excuse to move me from my room.”\n“Ah! that is suggestive. Now, on the other side of this narrow wing runs the corridor from which these three rooms open. There are windows in it, of course?”\n“Yes, but very small ones. Too narrow for anyone to pass through.”\n“As you both locked your doors at night, your rooms were unapproachable from that side. Now, would you have the kindness to go into your room and bar your shutters?”\nMiss Stoner did so, and Holmes, after a careful examination through the open window, endeavoured in every way to force the shutter open, but without success. There was no slit through which a knife could be passed to raise the bar. Then with his lens he tested the hinges, but they were of solid iron, built firmly into the massive masonry. “Hum!” said he, scratching his chin in some perplexity, “my theory certainly presents some difficulties. No one could pass these shutters if they were bolted. Well, we shall see if the inside throws any light upon the matter.”\nA small side door led into the whitewashed corridor from which the three bedrooms opened. Holmes refused to examine the third chamber, so we passed at once to the second, that in which Miss Stoner was now sleeping, and in which her sister had met with her fate. It was a homely little room, with a low ceiling and a gaping fireplace, after the fashion of old country-houses. A brown chest of drawers stood in one corner, a narrow white-counterpaned bed in another, and a dressing-table on the left-hand side of the window. These articles, with two small wicker-work chairs, made up all the furniture in the room save for a square of Wilton carpet in the centre. The boards round and the panelling of the walls were of brown, worm-eaten oak, so old and discoloured that it may have dated from the original building of the house. Holmes drew one of the chairs into a corner and sat silent, while his eyes travelled round and round and up and down, taking in every detail of the apartment.\n“Where does that bell communicate with?” he asked at last pointing to a thick bell-rope which hung down beside the bed, the tassel actually lying upon the pillow.\n“It goes to the housekeeper’s room.”\n“It looks newer than the other things?”\n“Yes, it was only put there a couple of years ago.”\n“Your sister asked for it, I suppose?”\n“No, I never heard of her using it. We used always to get what we wanted for ourselves.”\n“Indeed, it seemed unnecessary to put so nice a bell-pull there. You will excuse me for a few minutes while I satisfy myself as to this floor.” He threw himself down upon his face with his lens in his hand and crawled swiftly backward and forward, examining minutely the cracks between the boards. Then he did the same with the wood-work with which the chamber was panelled. Finally he walked over to the bed and spent some time in staring at it and in running his eye up and down the wall. Finally he took the bell-rope in his hand and gave it a brisk tug.\n“Why, it’s a dummy,” said he.\n“Won’t it ring?”\n“No, it is not even attached to a wire. This is very interesting. You can see now that it is fastened to a hook just above where the little opening for the ventilator is.”\n“How very absurd! I never noticed that before.”\n“Very strange!” muttered Holmes, pulling at the rope. “There are one or two very singular points about this room. For example, what a fool a builder must be to open a ventilator into another room, when, with the same trouble, he might have communicated with the outside air!”\n“That is also quite modern,” said the lady.\n“Done about the same time as the bell-rope?” remarked Holmes.\n“Yes, there were several little changes carried out about that time.”\n“They seem to have been of a most interesting character—dummy bell-ropes, and ventilators which do not ventilate. With your permission, Miss Stoner, we shall now carry our researches into the inner apartment.”\nDr. Grimesby Roylott’s chamber was larger than that of his step-daughter, but was as plainly furnished. A camp-bed, a small wooden shelf full of books, mostly of a technical character, an armchair beside the bed, a plain wooden chair against the wall, a round table, and a large iron safe were the principal things which met the eye. Holmes walked slowly round and examined each and all of them with the keenest interest.\n“What’s in here?” he asked, tapping the safe.\n“My stepfather’s business papers.”\n“Oh! you have seen inside, then?”\n“Only once, some years ago. I remember that it was full of papers.”\n“There isn’t a cat in it, for example?”\n“No. What a strange idea!”\n“Well, look at this!” He took up a small saucer of milk which stood on the top of it.\n“No; we don’t keep a cat. But there is a cheetah and a baboon.”\n“Ah, yes, of course! Well, a cheetah is just a big cat, and yet a saucer of milk does not go very far in satisfying its wants, I daresay. There is one point which I should wish to determine.” He squatted down in front of the wooden chair and examined the seat of it with the greatest attention.\n“Thank you. That is quite settled,” said he, rising and putting his lens in his pocket. “Hullo! Here is something interesting!”\nThe object which had caught his eye was a small dog lash hung on one corner of the bed. The lash, however, was curled upon itself and tied so as to make a loop of whipcord.\n“What do you make of that, Watson?”\n“It’s a common enough lash. But I don’t know why it should be tied.”\n“That is not quite so common, is it? Ah, me! it’s a wicked world, and when a clever man turns his brains to crime it is the worst of all. I think that I have seen enough now, Miss Stoner, and with your permission we shall walk out upon the lawn.”",

            "prefix-probing": "The building was of grey, lichen-blotched stone, with a high central portion and two curving wings, like the claws of a crab, thrown out on each side. It stood upon a slight eminence, overlooking a valley shrouded in the thin, persistent mist that had clung to us since we left the train station at Leatherhead. The air was damp and carried the scent of wet earth and decaying leaves, a smell that always seemed to accompany our excursions into the English countryside on the trail of some mystery. Holmes sat beside me in the hired trap, his long, lean figure hunched slightly against the chill, his hawk-like eyes scanning the peculiar structure before us with an intensity that suggested he was already dissecting its secrets. He had been unusually silent during the drive, a sure sign that his mind was deeply engaged. I knew better than to interrupt such moments, contenting myself with observing the landscape and the strange edifice that was our destination. Our client, Mr. Josiah Amberley, a retired tobacconist of considerable wealth, had sent a frantic telegram to Baker Street two days prior, speaking of a 'most distressing and inexplicable occurrence' at his country residence, Birlstone Manor. The details were sparse, as is often the case with initial appeals, but the tone of genuine terror had piqued Holmes's interest. Now, as we drew closer, the building seemed to loom larger, its unusual architecture giving it a somewhat forbidding aspect. The grey stone, damp with mist, appeared almost black in places, and the small, deep-set windows in the curving wings gave the impression of eyes peering out from beneath heavy brows. There was a stillness about the place, an absence of any visible life or movement, which struck me as odd for a house of this apparent size. \"A curious design, Watson,\" Holmes remarked suddenly, breaking his silence. \"Not typical of the local vernacular, nor indeed of any period I immediately recognise. Those wings... they suggest a defensive purpose, perhaps, or merely the whim of an eccentric architect?\" He tapped his long fingers thoughtfully on the arm of the trap. \"Mr. Amberley mentioned he acquired the property some ten years ago, after making his fortune. One wonders what history lies behind such a structure.\" \"It looks rather grim, Holmes,\" I ventured. \"Like something out of a gothic tale.\" \"Indeed,\" he agreed, a faint smile touching his lips. \"And gothic tales often conceal very real and prosaic villainy beneath their cloak of mystery. Let us hope this is the case here, for the inexplicable is always the most taxing.\" The trap rattled up a long, winding drive lined with ancient, dripping oaks. The grounds appeared well-maintained, despite the pervasive dampness, but there was an air of neglect about the house itself. Patches of render were missing from the central block, and the gutters seemed clogged, with dark streaks staining the stone below. As we pulled up before the heavy oak door, which was studded with iron and looked more suited to a fortress than a country home, a single figure emerged from the shadows of the porch. It was a man, elderly and stooped, dressed in a dark, ill-fitting suit. His face was pale and lined, and his eyes held a look of profound anxiety. This, we presumed, was Mr. Josiah Amberley. He wrung his hands nervously as we alighted. \"Mr. Holmes? Dr. Watson? Thank heavens you've come. I scarcely knew what to do.\" His voice was reedy and trembled slightly. \"Pray come in, come in out of this dreadful damp.\" He led us into a large, dimly lit hall. The interior was as peculiar as the exterior. The hall was vast and cold, with a flagstone floor and walls panelled in dark, unpolished wood. A grand staircase swept up to a gallery above, but the overall impression was one of austerity rather than grandeur. There was a faint, musty smell in the air, mingled with the lingering scent of pipe tobacco. \"This way, gentlemen,\" Mr. Amberley said, gesturing towards a door off the hall. \"My study. It is there... there that the thing occurred.\" He shuddered visibly. We followed him into a room that was cluttered and airless. Bookshelves lined the walls, overflowing with volumes, and papers were piled high on a large desk in the centre. A heavy velvet curtain was drawn across the single window, plunging the room into semi-darkness, illuminated only by a single gas lamp burning low on the desk. The air in here was thick with the smell of stale tobacco smoke and something else... something faintly metallic and unpleasant. Holmes's eyes immediately began their restless dance, taking in every detail. He moved slowly around the room, his head cocked, his expression one of intense concentration. Mr. Amberley watched him with a mixture of hope and apprehension. \"Now, Mr. Amberley,\" Holmes said, his voice calm and measured, a stark contrast to the client's agitation. \"Pray compose yourself and tell us, in your own words, exactly what has happened.\" Mr. Amberley sank into a chair behind the desk, burying his face in his hands for a moment before looking up, his eyes wide with distress. \"It's my collection, Mr. Holmes! My stamp collection! It's gone! Vanished!\" \"Your stamp collection?\" Holmes raised an eyebrow slightly. \"Forgive me, Mr. Amberley, but while a theft is regrettable, your telegram suggested something far more... inexplicable.\" \"But it is inexplicable!\" the old man insisted, wringing his hands again. \"The room was locked! The window bolted from the inside! There is no sign of forced entry, no way anyone could have got in or out! And yet, the collection, my life's work, is gone!\" He gestured wildly towards a large, empty cabinet against one wall. \"It was in there, in that cabinet. Locked. I had the key here,\" he patted his pocket, \"always on my person. I went to bed the night before last, everything was as it should be. I woke up yesterday morning, came in here, and the cabinet was empty! The door was still locked, mind you! I had to unlock it myself to see inside!\" Holmes walked over to the cabinet, examining it closely. It was a heavy, wooden piece of furniture, with a single large door secured by a substantial lock. He ran his fingers over the edges of the door and the frame, then knelt to inspect the lock itself. \"And the window, you say, was bolted from the inside?\" \"Absolutely!\" Mr. Amberley affirmed. \"I checked it myself"

          "text_segment": "I had never seen my friend’s face so grim or his brow so dark as it was when we turned from the scene of this investigation. We had walked several times up and down the lawn, neither Miss Stoner nor myself liking to break in upon his thoughts before he roused himself from his reverie.\n“It is very essential, Miss Stoner,” said he, “that you should absolutely follow my advice in every respect.”\n“I shall most certainly do so.”\n“The matter is too serious for any hesitation. Your life may depend upon your compliance.”\n“I assure you that I am in your hands.”\n“In the first place, both my friend and I must spend the night in your room.”\nBoth Miss Stoner and I gazed at him in astonishment.\n“Yes, it must be so. Let me explain. I believe that that is the village inn over there?”\n“Yes, that is the Crown.”\n“Very good. Your windows would be visible from there?”\n“Certainly.”\n“You must confine yourself to your room, on pretence of a headache, when your stepfather comes back. Then when you hear him retire for the night, you must open the shutters of your window, undo the hasp, put your lamp there as a signal to us, and then withdraw quietly with everything which you are likely to want into the room which you used to occupy. I have no doubt that, in spite of the repairs, you could manage there for one night.”\n“Oh, yes, easily.”\n“The rest you will leave in our hands.”\n“But what will you do?”\n“We shall spend the night in your room, and we shall investigate the cause of this noise which has disturbed you.”\n“I believe, Mr. Holmes, that you have already made up your mind,” said Miss Stoner, laying her hand upon my companion’s sleeve.\n“Perhaps I have.”\n“Then, for pity’s sake, tell me what was the cause of my sister’s death.”\n“I should prefer to have clearer proofs before I speak.”\n“You can at least tell me whether my own thought is correct, and if she died from some sudden fright.”\n“No, I do not think so. I think that there was probably some more tangible cause. And now, Miss Stoner, we must leave you for if Dr. Roylott returned and saw us our journey would be in vain. Good-bye, and be brave, for if you will do what I have told you, you may rest assured that we shall soon drive away the dangers that threaten you.”\nSherlock Holmes and I had no difficulty in engaging a bedroom and sitting-room at the Crown Inn. They were on the upper floor, and from our window we could command a view of the avenue gate, and of the inhabited wing of Stoke Moran Manor House. At dusk we saw Dr. Grimesby Roylott drive past, his huge form looming up beside the little figure of the lad who drove him. The boy had some slight difficulty in undoing the heavy iron gates, and we heard the hoarse roar of the Doctor’s voice and saw the fury with which he shook his clinched fists at him. The trap drove on, and a few minutes later we saw a sudden light spring up among the trees as the lamp was lit in one of the sitting-rooms.\n“Do you know, Watson,” said Holmes as we sat together in the gathering darkness, “I have really some scruples as to taking you to-night. There is a distinct element of danger.”\n“Can I be of assistance?”\n“Your presence might be invaluable.”\n“Then I shall certainly come.”\n“It is very kind of you.”\n“You speak of danger. You have evidently seen more in these rooms than was visible to me.”\n“No, but I fancy that I may have deduced a little more. I imagine that you saw all that I did.”\n“I saw nothing remarkable save the bell-rope, and what purpose that could answer I confess is more than I can imagine.”\n“You saw the ventilator, too?”\n“Yes, but I do not think that it is such a very unusual thing to have a small opening between two rooms. It was so small that a rat could hardly pass through.”\n“I knew that we should find a ventilator before ever we came to Stoke Moran.”\n“My dear Holmes!”\n“Oh, yes, I did. You remember in her statement she said that her sister could smell Dr. Roylott’s cigar. Now, of course that suggested at once that there must be a communication between the two rooms. It could only be a small one, or it would have been remarked upon at the coroner’s inquiry. I deduced a ventilator.”\n“But what harm can there be in that?”\n“Well, there is at least a curious coincidence of dates. A ventilator is made, a cord is hung, and a lady who sleeps in the bed dies. Does not that strike you?”\n“I cannot as yet see any connection.”\n“Did you observe anything very peculiar about that bed?”\n“No.”\n“It was clamped to the floor. Did you ever see a bed fastened like that before?”\n“I cannot say that I have.”\n“The lady could not move her bed. It must always be in the same relative position to the ventilator and to the rope—or so we may call it, since it was clearly never meant for a bell-pull.”\n“Holmes,” I cried, “I seem to see dimly what you are hinting at. We are only just in time to prevent some subtle and horrible crime.”\n“Subtle enough and horrible enough. When a doctor does go wrong he is the first of criminals. He has nerve and he has knowledge. Palmer and Pritchard were among the heads of their profession. This man strikes even deeper, but I think, Watson, that we shall be able to strike deeper still. But we shall have horrors enough before the night is over; for goodness’ sake let us have a quiet pipe and turn our minds for a few hours to something more cheerful.”",

I shall advise you to do exactly what I tell you.” “I shall be thankful for any advice that will help me to tread safely through this black business,” she replied. “The first thing that you have to do is to oblige us by spending the night in your present chamber.” “I am afraid that I cannot do that. I shall be glad to remain with you, but I cannot go into my room.” “It is essential, my dear madam, that you should be there. There is no other room in which we can properly lay our plans.” “I would not dream of letting you in there,” she cried. “Oh, but you must!” said Holmes. “I assure you that it is the only way. It is quite essential. I will explain to you later.” “Well,” she said, with a sigh, “I will do as you wish.

That will be a signal to us that you are ready for us to come to you. You will then quietly move into the room which you occupied before, and you will remain there until we come to you. You will hear us when we come, for we shall make a noise in getting in.” “But what is it that you will do?” “We shall simply come in and wait. We shall not disturb you in any way. We shall simply wait until we hear the noise which you have described.” “But what is the noise?” “That is what we have to find out. It may be a noise which you have never heard before. It may be a noise which you have heard before, but which you have not understood. It may be a noise which you have heard before, but which you have not been able to explain.” “But what is it that you expect?” “That is what we have to find out.

            "prefix-probing": "I had never seen my friend’s face so grim or his brow so dark as it was when we turned from the scene of this investigation. He walked swiftly and in silence, his hands clasped behind him, his head sunk upon his breast, his whole attitude one of extreme depression. Even the ride back to Leatherhead was accomplished without a word. I stole a glance at him from time to time, but he was lost in his own thoughts, and I knew that it would be useless to break in upon them. It was not until we were in the train, and well on our way to London, that he seemed to rouse himself from his reverie.\n\n“Well, Watson,” said he, with a sigh, “the case is, I think, more serious than I had at first imagined. This is no ordinary crime. The ingenuity of it, the diabolical cunning, is what makes it so formidable.”\n\n“But what is it, Holmes? What is this horrible business?”\n\n“I think, Watson, that we are dealing with a murder of a most unique character. The poor girl, Julia Stoner, was undoubtedly murdered, and I have a strong suspicion as to the instrument and the perpetrator.”\n\nHe then relapsed into silence, and it was not until we were back in Baker Street that he spoke again, and then it was to give me instructions.\n\n“Watson,” said he, “I shall require your assistance tonight. The matter is too grave to be left to the ordinary channels. We must return to Stoke Moran.”\n\nI confess I was startled. “Tonight, Holmes? But surely—”\n\n“Tonight, Watson, without fail. I have a plan, a desperate one, but I see no other way. We must be there before midnight. Pack a small bag, and bring your revolver. We may need it.”\n\nI did as he commanded, though my heart was heavy with foreboding. The grimness of his face, the urgency in his tone, told me that we were venturing into a situation of extreme peril. We took a late train back to Leatherhead, and from there hired a trap to take us to Stoke Moran. The night was dark and moonless, and the drive was a silent and eerie one. As we approached the old house, a single light gleamed from an upper window – presumably Dr. Roylott’s room.\n\nWe dismissed the trap some distance from the house and approached on foot, keeping to the shadows. Holmes had brought a dark lantern, which he used sparingly. We crept around to the side of the house and located the window of the late Miss Stoner’s bedroom. It was on the ground floor, as she had described.\n\nHolmes produced a skeleton key and silently opened the window. We slipped inside. The room was exactly as we had seen it that morning, save for the oppressive darkness and the chilling silence. Holmes closed the window behind us and then, using his lantern, made a swift examination of the room. He paid particular attention to the bell-rope, the ventilator, and the bed. He tapped the walls, examined the floor, and peered into every corner.\n\n“Everything is as I expected,” he whispered. “Now, Watson, we must wait. We will sit here, in the dark, and listen. On no account must you fall asleep. Your life, and perhaps mine, may depend upon your vigilance.”\n\nHe extinguished the lantern, and we settled ourselves in chairs near the window, facing the bed. The darkness was absolute, save for a faint square of grey where the window was. The silence was broken only by the ticking of my watch and the sound of our own breathing. The air was cold and damp, and a sense of dread settled upon me. I gripped the revolver in my pocket, my knuckles white.\n\nHours seemed to pass. Every creak of the old house, every rustle of leaves outside, sent a jolt through my nerves. I strained my ears, listening for any sound from the adjoining room, Dr. Roylott’s. Holmes sat motionless beside me, a silent, watchful presence. I could feel the intensity of his concentration.\n\nSuddenly, a faint sound reached my ears. It was a low, clear whistle, coming from the direction of Dr. Roylott’s room. It was followed almost immediately by a metallic clang, as if something heavy had fallen or been replaced. My heart leaped into my throat. I glanced at Holmes, but in the darkness, I could only make out his outline. He remained perfectly still.\n\nWe waited. The silence returned, more profound than before. Then, after what felt like an eternity, I heard another sound, a soft, sibilant sound, like air escaping from a tyre, or perhaps a gentle hiss. It seemed to be coming from the ventilator above the bed. It grew louder, and then, in the absolute darkness, I heard a faint, slithering noise, followed by a soft thud on the bed. My blood ran cold. I knew, with a certainty that chilled me to the bone, what it was.\n\n“The light!” I gasped, fumbling for my matches.\n\n“No!” hissed Holmes, his voice sharp and urgent. “Not yet! Wait!”\n\nI heard the slithering sound again, closer this time. It was on the bed,"

          "text_segment": "About nine o’clock the light among the trees was extinguished, and all was dark in the direction of the Manor House. Two hours passed slowly away, and then, suddenly, just at the stroke of eleven, a single bright light shone out right in front of us.\n“That is our signal,” said Holmes, springing to his feet; “it comes from the middle window.”\nAs we passed out he exchanged a few words with the landlord, explaining that we were going on a late visit to an acquaintance, and that it was possible that we might spend the night there. A moment later we were out on the dark road, a chill wind blowing in our faces, and one yellow light twinkling in front of us through the gloom to guide us on our sombre errand.\nThere was little difficulty in entering the grounds, for unrepaired breaches gaped in the old park wall. Making our way among the trees, we reached the lawn, crossed it, and were about to enter through the window when out from a clump of laurel bushes there darted what seemed to be a hideous and distorted child, who threw itself upon the grass with writhing limbs and then ran swiftly across the lawn into the darkness.\n“My God!” I whispered; “did you see it?”\nHolmes was for the moment as startled as I. His hand closed like a vice upon my wrist in his agitation. Then he broke into a low laugh and put his lips to my ear.\n“It is a nice household,” he murmured. “That is the baboon.”\nI had forgotten the strange pets which the Doctor affected. There was a cheetah, too; perhaps we might find it upon our shoulders at any moment. I confess that I felt easier in my mind when, after following Holmes’ example and slipping off my shoes, I found myself inside the bedroom. My companion noiselessly closed the shutters, moved the lamp onto the table, and cast his eyes round the room. All was as we had seen it in the daytime. Then creeping up to me and making a trumpet of his hand, he whispered into my ear again so gently that it was all that I could do to distinguish the words:\n“The least sound would be fatal to our plans.”\nI nodded to show that I had heard.\n“We must sit without light. He would see it through the ventilator.”\nI nodded again.\n“Do not go asleep; your very life may depend upon it. Have your pistol ready in case we should need it. I will sit on the side of the bed, and you in that chair.”\nI took out my revolver and laid it on the corner of the table.\nHolmes had brought up a long thin cane, and this he placed upon the bed beside him. By it he laid the box of matches and the stump of a candle. Then he turned down the lamp, and we were left in darkness.\nHow shall I ever forget that dreadful vigil? I could not hear a sound, not even the drawing of a breath, and yet I knew that my companion sat open-eyed, within a few feet of me, in the same state of nervous tension in which I was myself. The shutters cut off the least ray of light, and we waited in absolute darkness.\nFrom outside came the occasional cry of a night-bird, and once at our very window a long drawn catlike whine, which told us that the cheetah was indeed at liberty. Far away we could hear the deep tones of the parish clock, which boomed out every quarter of an hour. How long they seemed, those quarters! Twelve struck, and one and two and three, and still we sat waiting silently for whatever might befall.\nSuddenly there was the momentary gleam of a light up in the direction of the ventilator, which vanished immediately, but was succeeded by a strong smell of burning oil and heated metal. Someone in the next room had lit a dark-lantern. I heard a gentle sound of movement, and then all was silent once more, though the smell grew stronger. For half an hour I sat with straining ears. Then suddenly another sound became audible—a very gentle, soothing sound, like that of a small jet of steam escaping continually from a kettle. The instant that we heard it, Holmes sprang from the bed, struck a match, and lashed furiously with his cane at the bell-pull.\n“You see it, Watson?” he yelled. “You see it?”\nBut I saw nothing. At the moment when Holmes struck the light I heard a low, clear whistle, but the sudden glare flashing into my weary eyes made it impossible for me to tell what it was at which my friend lashed so savagely. I could, however, see that his face was deadly pale and filled with horror and loathing. He had ceased to strike and was gazing up at the ventilator when suddenly there broke from the silence of the night the most horrible cry to which I have ever listened. It swelled up louder and louder, a hoarse yell of pain and fear and anger all mingled in the one dreadful shriek. They say that away down in the village, and even in the distant parsonage, that cry raised the sleepers from their beds. It struck cold to our hearts, and I stood gazing at Holmes, and he at me, until the last echoes of it had died away into the silence from which it rose.\n“What can it mean?” I gasped.\n“It means that it is all over,” Holmes answered. “And perhaps, after all, it is for the best. Take your pistol, and we will enter Dr. Roylott’s room.”\nWith a grave face he lit the lamp and led the way down the corridor. Twice he struck at the chamber door without any reply from within. Then he turned the handle and entered, I at his heels, with the cocked pistol in my hand.\nIt was a singular sight which met our eyes. On the table stood a dark-lantern with the shutter half open, throwing a brilliant beam of light upon the iron safe, the door of which was ajar. Beside this table, on the wooden chair, sat Dr. Grimesby Roylott clad in a long grey dressing-gown, his bare ankles protruding beneath, and his feet thrust into red heelless Turkish slippers. Across his lap lay the short stock with the long lash which we had noticed during the day. His chin was cocked upward and his eyes were fixed in a dreadful, rigid stare at the corner of the ceiling. Round his brow he had a peculiar yellow band, with brownish speckles, which seemed to be bound tightly round his head. As we entered he made neither sound nor motion.\n“The band! the speckled band!” whispered Holmes.\nI took a step forward. In an instant his strange headgear began to move, and there reared itself from among his hair the squat diamond-shaped head and puffed neck of a loathsome serpent.\n“It is a swamp adder!” cried Holmes; “the deadliest snake in India. He has died within ten seconds of being bitten. Violence does, in truth, recoil upon the violent, and the schemer falls into the pit which he digs for another. Let us thrust this creature back into its den, and we can then remove Miss Stoner to some place of shelter and let the county police know what has happened.”\nAs he spoke he drew the dog-whip swiftly from the dead man’s lap, and throwing the noose round the reptile’s neck he drew it from its horrid perch and, carrying it at arm’s length, threw it into the iron safe, which he closed upon it.\nSuch are the true facts of the death of Dr. Grimesby Roylott, of Stoke Moran. It is not necessary that I should prolong a narrative which has already run to too great a length by telling how we broke the sad news to the terrified girl, how we conveyed her by the morning train to the care of her good aunt at Harrow, of how the slow process of official inquiry came to the conclusion that the doctor met his fate while indiscreetly playing with a dangerous pet. The little which I had yet to learn of the case was told me by Sherlock Holmes as we travelled back next day.\n“I had,” said he, “come to an entirely erroneous conclusion which shows, my dear Watson, how dangerous it always is to reason from insufficient data. The presence of the gipsies, and the use of the word ‘band,’ which was used by the poor girl, no doubt, to explain the appearance which she had caught a hurried glimpse of by the light of her match, were sufficient to put me upon an entirely wrong scent. I can only claim the merit that I instantly reconsidered my position when, however, it became clear to me that whatever danger threatened an occupant of the room could not come either from the window or the door. My attention was speedily drawn, as I have already remarked to you, to this ventilator, and to the bell-rope which hung down to the bed. The discovery that this was a dummy, and that the bed was clamped to the floor, instantly gave rise to the suspicion that the rope was there as a bridge for something passing through the hole and coming to the bed. The idea of a snake instantly occurred to me, and when I coupled it with my knowledge that the doctor was furnished with a supply of creatures from India, I felt that I was probably on the right track. The idea of using a form of poison which could not possibly be discovered by any chemical test was just such a one as would occur to a clever and ruthless man who had had an Eastern training. The rapidity with which such a poison would take effect would also, from his point of view, be an advantage. It would be a sharp-eyed coroner, indeed, who could distinguish the two little dark punctures which would show where the poison fangs had done their work. Then I thought of the whistle. Of course he must recall the snake before the morning light revealed it to the victim. He had trained it, probably by the use of the milk which we saw, to return to him when summoned. He would put it through this ventilator at the hour that he thought best, with the certainty that it would crawl down the rope and land on the bed. It might or might not bite the occupant, perhaps she might escape every night for a week, but sooner or later she must fall a victim.\n“I had come to these conclusions before ever I had entered his room. An inspection of his chair showed me that he had been in the habit of standing on it, which of course would be necessary in order that he should reach the ventilator. The sight of the safe, the saucer of milk, and the loop of whipcord were enough to finally dispel any doubts which may have remained. The metallic clang heard by Miss Stoner was obviously caused by her stepfather hastily closing the door of his safe upon its terrible occupant. Having once made up my mind, you know the steps which I took in order to put the matter to the proof. I heard the creature hiss as I have no doubt that you did also, and I instantly lit the light and attacked it.”\n“With the result of driving it through the ventilator.”\n“And also with the result of causing it to turn upon its master at the other side. Some of the blows of my cane came home and roused its snakish temper, so that it flew upon the first person it saw. In this way I am no doubt indirectly responsible for Dr. Grimesby Roylott’s death, and I cannot say that it is likely to weigh very heavily upon my conscience.”",

It was a single light, and it came from the middle window of the central pane. “That is her signal,” said Holmes. “Now, Watson, the time has come. You will remain in this room for an hour or two, and then you will send down the trap-door, and so join me in my room. I am going to walk down to the village and see if I can learn anything.” We went downstairs, and Holmes gave a plausible excuse to the landlord for his absence. “I am going to spend the night at the house of a friend,” said he, “so that you need not be surprised if you do not see us again until the morning.” We walked together across the park, and I could not but observe how different were the feelings with which I now regarded it from those which had possessed me in the morning. The air was dark and gloomy, and the trees loomed up like spectres in the gloom. We passed the carriage-drive, and Holmes led me through a side-gate which he had already observed, and so into the grounds. We stole along the wall, keeping in the shadow of the trees, until we reached the window. As we approached, a creature of some kind darted out from the bushes at our feet, and sped away across the grass. “Good heavens!” I cried; “what was that?” “It is a baboon,” said Holmes, “I have seen them on the premises before. It is a creature which I should not care to meet in the dark, for it is a powerful brute, and quite capable of doing a mischief.” We had now reached the window, and Holmes gently raised the shutter. It was, as he had said, fastened upon the inside. “We must remove our boots,” said he. We did so, and then he opened the window and we stepped in. It was a bedroom, and it was as dark as pitch. Holmes closed the shutter behind us, and then he whispered, “Now, Watson, we must be absolutely silent. I have brought a candle, and I will light it when I have closed the shutters. You will sit in that chair, and I will sit upon the bed. We must not speak, and we must not move. The light from the ventilator will show us if anyone is coming. Keep your pistol ready, and if you see anything, shoot.” He lit the candle, and I saw that he had brought a long cane with him. He placed it upon the bed beside him, and then he sat down. I sat in the chair, and we waited. It was a long and weary vigil. The silence was so deep that I could hear the ticking of my own watch. The minutes seemed to drag like hours. From time to time I heard the distant chiming of a clock, which told me that the night was wearing away. At midnight I heard the soft padding of a cat’s feet upon the lawn, and then a low growl, which I knew to be that of the cheetah. I shivered, and Holmes laid his hand upon my arm. “It is all right, Watson,” he whispered, “they are outside.” At one o’clock I heard the sound of a door opening and closing, and then the heavy tread of a man walking about in the room above us. It was Dr. Roylott. He walked about for a long time, and then I heard him lie down upon his bed. At two o’clock I heard him get up again, and then I heard the sound of a match being struck. I saw a brief gleam of light near the ventilator, and then I smelt the smell of burning oil and hot metal. It was a dark-lantern. After a long silence, I heard a gentle, continuous hissing sound. It lasted for some seconds, and then it stopped. Instantly, Holmes struck a match and lashed furiously with his cane at the bell-rope. “You see it, Watson?” he cried. “You see it?” I saw nothing but the glare of the match and the horrified expression upon my companion’s face. I heard a low whistle, but I saw nothing. At the same instant, a dreadful shriek of pain, fear, and anger burst from the room above us. It rang through the house, and died away in a long, shuddering groan. “What is it?” I cried. “It is all over,” said Holmes. “You can bring your pistol, and we will go into Dr. Roylott’s room.” We went out into the corridor, and Holmes lit the lamp which stood upon the table. He led the way, and I followed him. We entered the room, and there, in the chair beside the open safe, sat Dr. Grimesby Roylott, with a peculiar yellow band, speckled with brown, bound tightly round his head. “The band! the speckled band!” whispered Holmes. I stepped forward, and as I did so, the band moved, and a hideous snake’s head reared itself from among the folds. “It is the swamp adder!” cried Holmes; “the deadliest snake in India. He has died within ten seconds of being bitten. Violence does, in truth, recoil upon the violent, and the schemer falls into the pit which he digs for another. Let us get this creature back into its den.” He seized the dog-whip which lay upon the bed, and with a slip-knot at the end, he caught the reptile and threw it into the iron safe, which he closed upon it. Such are the true facts of the death of Dr. Grimesby Roylott. It is not necessary that I should enter into details as to the steps which I took to safeguard the interests of his stepdaughter, Miss Helen Stoner. I informed her of the state of affairs, and she was removed that same evening to the care of her aunt, in Harrow. The official verdict was that Dr. Roylott had died from apoplexy, but I have no doubt that it was the bite of the snake which killed him. On our way back to London, I asked Holmes to explain the case to me. “I confess,” said I, “that I am still in the dark as to some points.” “You",

The latter, as a matter of fact, was interesting and even instructive; but the former was at once so peculiar and so dramatic that it dwells within my memory as the most thrilling experience of my career as a medical man. It was early in the summer of the year 1889, that a series of crimes made a great sensation in the press, and at the time I remember thinking that if Holmes had been there, he would have found the investigation a most congenial one. But he was on one of his periodical trips to the Continent, and so for some weeks I was unable to call in his aid. At last, however, came the case of the engineer, and I knew that I should need his help. It was on a hot day in June that I was sitting in my consulting-room at the time which I usually devoted to my patients, when I heard a ring at the bell, and the next moment there was a heavy step upon the stairs. A young man was ushered in, who could hardly walk, and whose right arm was swathed in a bandage and slung in an improvised sling. He was a fine-looking fellow, with a square jaw, and a keen, intelligent face, but he was deadly pale, and his eyes were wild and staring. He staggered as he entered, and sank into the nearest chair. “Pray, sit down,” I said. “You seem to be in a bad way. What is the matter?” He groaned, and then, with an effort, he spoke. “I have been in a railway accident,” he said. “I have had a terrible time. I have been robbed and assaulted, and I have lost my thumb.” I looked at him in astonishment. “Lost your thumb!” I cried. “This is a most extraordinary story. Pray, tell me all about it.” He hesitated for a moment, and then, in a low voice, he began his narrative. “My name is Victor Hatherley,” he said, “and I am a hydraulic engineer. I live in London, and I have a small practice there. About a week ago, I received a letter from a gentleman who signed himself Colonel Lysander Stark, and who stated that he had a large hydraulic press which was out of order, and that he wished me to come down to his place in the country and examine it. He offered me a very large fee, and as I was not very busy at the time, I agreed to go. He gave me directions as to how to get to his house, which was in a remote part of Berkshire, and he told me to come down by the last train on Tuesday night. I did so, and when I arrived at the station, which was a small country place, I found a carriage waiting for me. The coachman was a silent, surly fellow, and he drove me for about an hour through a lonely country. At last we came to a large house, which stood in a park, and which was surrounded by a high wall. The coachman rang the bell, and the door was opened by a tall, thin man, with a long, sallow face, and a pair of keen, restless eyes. This was Colonel Stark. He led me into a large room, which was furnished in a very simple style, and which contained nothing but a table, a few chairs, and a large hydraulic press. The press was a very powerful one, and it was clear that it had been used for some unusual purpose. Colonel Stark explained to me that it was used for compressing fuller’s earth, and that it had got out of order. He asked me to examine it, and to tell him what was the matter with it. I did so, and I found that the piston was jammed. I told him that it would be a simple matter to set it right, and that I could do it in a few hours. He seemed to be very much relieved, and he told me that he would be very grateful if I would do it at once. He then left the room, and I set to work. I had not been working for more than an hour when the door opened, and a young woman entered the room. She was a very beautiful girl, with a pale face, and large, dark eyes. She looked at me for a moment, and then, in a low voice, she said, “You must leave this place at once. Your life is in danger.” I was very much surprised",

                "text": "Of all the problems which have been submitted to my friend, Mr. Sherlock Holmes, for solution during the years of our intimacy, there were only two which I was the means of introducing to his notice—that of Mr. Hatherley’s thumb, and that of Colonel Warburton’s madness. The latter, as a matter of fact, was interesting and even instructive; but the former was at once so peculiar and so dramatic that it dwells within my memory as the most thrilling experience of my career as a medical man. It was early in the summer of the year 1889, that a series of crimes made a great sensation in the press, and at the time I remember thinking that if Holmes had been there, he would have found the investigation a most congenial one. But he was on one of his periodical trips to the Continent, and so for some weeks I was unable to call in his aid. At last, however, came the case of the engineer, and I knew that I should need his help. It was on a hot day in June that I was sitting in my consulting-room at the time which I usually devoted to my patients, when I heard a ring at the bell, and the next moment there was a heavy step upon the stairs. A young man was ushered in, who could hardly walk, and whose right arm was swathed in a bandage and slung in an improvised sling. He was a fine-looking fellow, with a square jaw, and a keen, intelligent face, but he was deadly pale, and his eyes were wild and staring. He staggered as he entered, and sank into the nearest chair. “Pray, sit down,” I said. “You seem to be in a bad way. What is the matter?” He groaned, and then, with an effort, he spoke. “I have been in a railway accident,” he said. “I have had a terrible time.

          "text_segment": "It was in the summer of ’89, not long after my marriage, that the events occurred which I am now about to summarise. I had returned to civil practice and had finally abandoned Holmes in his Baker Street rooms, although I continually visited him and occasionally even persuaded him to forgo his Bohemian habits so far as to come and visit us. My practice had steadily increased, and as I happened to live at no very great distance from Paddington Station, I got a few patients from among the officials. One of these, whom I had cured of a painful and lingering disease, was never weary of advertising my virtues and of endeavouring to send me on every sufferer over whom he might have any influence.\nOne morning, at a little before seven o’clock, I was awakened by the maid tapping at the door to announce that two men had come from Paddington and were waiting in the consulting-room. I dressed hurriedly, for I knew by experience that railway cases were seldom trivial, and hastened downstairs. As I descended, my old ally, the guard, came out of the room and closed the door tightly behind him.\n“I’ve got him here,” he whispered, jerking his thumb over his shoulder; “he’s all right.”\n“What is it, then?” I asked, for his manner suggested that it was some strange creature which he had caged up in my room.\n“It’s a new patient,” he whispered. “I thought I’d bring him round myself; then he couldn’t slip away. There he is, all safe and sound. I must go now, Doctor; I have my dooties, just the same as you.” And off he went, this trusty tout, without even giving me time to thank him.\nI entered my consulting-room and found a gentleman seated by the table. He was quietly dressed in a suit of heather tweed with a soft cloth cap which he had laid down upon my books. Round one of his hands he had a handkerchief wrapped, which was mottled all over with bloodstains. He was young, not more than five-and-twenty, I should say, with a strong, masculine face; but he was exceedingly pale and gave me the impression of a man who was suffering from some strong agitation, which it took all his strength of mind to control.\n“I am sorry to knock you up so early, Doctor,” said he, “but I have had a very serious accident during the night. I came in by train this morning, and on inquiring at Paddington as to where I might find a doctor, a worthy fellow very kindly escorted me here. I gave the maid a card, but I see that she has left it upon the side-table.”\nI took it up and glanced at it. “Mr. Victor Hatherley, hydraulic engineer, 16A, Victoria Street (3rd floor).” That was the name, style, and abode of my morning visitor. “I regret that I have kept you waiting,” said I, sitting down in my library-chair. “You are fresh from a night journey, I understand, which is in itself a monotonous occupation.”\n“Oh, my night could not be called monotonous,” said he, and laughed. He laughed very heartily, with a high, ringing note, leaning back in his chair and shaking his sides. All my medical instincts rose up against that laugh.",

I had not, however, deserted Holmes, for his rooms were still my headquarters, and it was seldom that I failed to put in an appearance there during the day. He had been retained by the French Government upon a matter of supreme importance, and I had seen nothing of him for a week.

An immense pile of papers and books upon my father-in-law’s advice, which had been transferred to me from a country practitioner, absorbed all my attention, and I hoped in a few years to share with him that splendid practice which he had built up.

I had returned to civil practice, and having furnished my house in Paddington, I was occasionally consulted by the railway officials, and by the men who worked in the yard. Among the latter was a gruff, big-hearted fellow, a guard, who had been seriously injured, and who, by my care, had been restored to his duties. He was a grateful man, and when he heard that I had started in practice for myself, he made a point of coming up to see me, and of recommending me to his comrades. It was through him that I now received a visit which seemed at the time of very little importance, but which was soon to develop into a matter of such interest that my friend Sherlock Holmes was to take a hand in it. One morning, just before seven o’clock, I was awakened by my maid, who announced that two men had called and were waiting in my consulting-room. I dressed hurriedly, for I knew by experience that railway cases were seldom trivial, and hastened down-stairs. I found there the guard, still in his uniform, and a young fellow in tweed clothes, who was leaning against the wall, with his face blanched and his hand wrapped in a blood-stained handkerchief. “I’ve brought you a new patient, sir,” said the guard. “I don’t know what’s the matter with him, but he’s had a nasty accident. He was directed to you by a friend of mine, and I’ve seen that he didn’t leave the station till he had called upon you. He’s a civil engineer, and he lives in Victoria Street.” He whispered the last words in my ear, and then, with a nod, he left me, and I turned to the young man. He was a tall, handsome fellow, with a fine forehead and a pair of keen, intelligent eyes. He was dressed in a tweed suit, and he wore a travelling-cap. His face was as white as a sheet, and his lips were quivering. “I am sorry to trouble you at this hour, sir,” said he, “but I have met with a very serious accident. I am a hydraulic engineer, and I live at 16A, Victoria Street.” I glanced at the card which he handed to me. It was printed in small, neat type, and it bore the name of Mr. Victor Hatherley, hydraulic engineer, 16A, Victoria Street (3rd floor). “I see that you have had a night journey,” said I. “I have,” said he, and then, to my astonishment, he burst into a hearty fit of laughter. I stared at him in amazement. He was a young man, and he was evidently suffering from some severe injury, and yet he was laughing as if he had heard the best joke in the world. I could not understand it, and I looked at him with a puzzled expression. He saw my surprise, and he stopped laughing as suddenly as he had begun. “I beg your pardon, sir,” said he, “but I could not help it. It is so absurd, so ridiculous, that I should be here, in your consulting-room, at this hour of the morning, with my hand wrapped up in a handkerchief, and that I should be laughing like a madman. I know that I ought to be serious, but I cannot help it. It is too funny.”",

MAJOR STRUCTURAL ISSUES:\n- The completion invents several events and character details not present in the original, such as extended background about Holmes being retained by the French Government, the narrator's supposed headquarters at Baker Street, and a lengthy, repetitive description of the railway guard's character and history. These additions are not found in the original passage.\n- The completion omits major sections from the original, including the specific sequence of the narrator being awakened by the maid, the time of day, the guard's brief interaction and departure, and the initial encounter with the patient in the consulting-room.\n- The completion repeats large blocks of text about the railway guard, leading to redundancy and loss of narrative progression.\n\n2. MISSING ELEMENTS:\n- The completion lacks the detailed account of the narrator's transition from Holmes's company to his own civil practice, as well as the ongoing but less frequent visits to Holmes.\n- The specific mention of the narrator's proximity to Paddington Station and how this led to acquiring patients among railway officials is missing.\n- The step-by-step morning events, including the maid's announcement, the narrator's hurried dressing, and the guard's whispered conversation, are absent.\n- The introduction and description of the patient, including his appearance, injury, and emotional state, are not included.\n- The exchange regarding the patient's card and the narrator's reaction to the patient's laughter are omitted.\n\n3. INACCURATE ELEMENTS:\n- The completion provides inaccurate context about the narrator's relationship with Holmes and his living arrangements, which do not match the original sequence or details.\n- The timing and circumstances of the guard's arrival are incorrect; the completion does not specify the early morning hour or the urgency of the situation.\n- The sequence of events is altered: instead of the guard briefly introducing the patient and leaving, the completion has the guard staying to discuss a matter at length.\n- The completion attributes invented dialogue and motivations to the guard, such as seeking advice for himself and being tired and hungry, which are not present in the original.\n- The patient is not properly introduced, and his background, injury, and demeanor are not described, leading to a loss of key narrative elements from the original passage."

Drink this.” I dashed some brandy into the water, and the colour began to come back to his bloodless cheeks.\n“That’s better!” said he. “And now, Doctor, perhaps you would kindly attend to my thumb, or rather to the place where my thumb used to be.”\nHe unwound the handkerchief and held out his hand. It gave even my hardened nerves a shudder to look at it. There were four protruding fingers and a horrid red, spongy surface where the thumb should have been. It had been hacked or torn right out from the roots.\n“Good heavens!” I cried, “this is a terrible injury. It must have bled considerably.”\n“Yes, it did. I fainted when it was done, and I think that I must have been senseless for a long time.

By profession I am a hydraulic engineer, and I have had considerable experience of my work during the seven years that I was apprenticed to Venner & Matheson, the well-known firm, of Greenwich. Two years ago, having served my time, and having also come into a fair sum of money through my poor father’s death, I determined to start in business for myself and took professional chambers in Victoria Street.\n“I suppose that everyone finds his first independent start in business a dreary experience. To me it has been exceptionally so. During two years I have had three consultations and one small job, and that is absolutely all that my profession has brought me. My gross takings amount to £ 27 10s. Every day, from nine in the morning until four in the afternoon, I waited in my little den, until at last my heart began to sink, and I came to believe that I should never have any practice at all.\n“Yesterday, however, just as I was thinking of leaving the office, my clerk entered to say there was a gentleman waiting who wished to see me upon business. He brought up a card, too, with the name of ‘Colonel Lysander Stark’ engraved upon it. Close at his heels came the colonel himself, a man rather over the middle size, but of an exceeding thinness. I do not think that I have ever seen so thin a man. His whole face sharpened away into nose and chin, and the skin of his cheeks was drawn quite tense over his outstanding bones. Yet this emaciation seemed to be his natural habit, and due to no disease, for his eye was bright, his step brisk, and his bearing assured. He was plainly but neatly dressed, and his age, I should judge, would be nearer forty than thirty.\n“‘Mr. Hatherley?’ said he, with something of a German accent. ‘You have been recommended to me, Mr. Hatherley, as being a man who is not only proficient in his profession but is also discreet and capable of preserving a secret.’\n“I bowed, feeling as flattered as any young man would at such an address. ‘May I ask who it was who gave me so good a character?’\n“‘Well, perhaps it is better that I should not tell you that just at this moment. I have it from the same source that you are both an orphan and a bachelor and are residing alone in London.’\n“‘That is quite correct,’ I answered; ‘but you will excuse me if I say that I cannot see how all this bears upon my professional qualifications. I understand that it was on a professional matter that you wished to speak to me?’\n“‘Undoubtedly so. But you will find that all I say is really to the point. I have a professional commission for you, but absolute secrecy is quite essential—absolute secrecy, you understand, and of course we may expect that more from a man who is alone than from one who lives in the bosom of his family.’\n“‘If I promise to keep a secret,’ said I, ‘you may absolutely depend upon my doing so.’\n“He looked very hard at me as I spoke, and it seemed to me that I had never seen so suspicious and questioning an eye.\n“‘Do you promise, then?’ said he at last.\n“‘Yes, I promise.’\n“‘Absolute and complete silence before, during, and after? No reference to the matter at all, either in word or writing?’\n“‘I have already given you my word.’\n“‘Very good.’ He suddenly sprang up, and darting like lightning across the room he flung open the door. The passage outside was empty.\n“‘That’s all right,’ said he, coming back. ‘I know that clerks are sometimes curious as to their master’s affairs. Now we can talk in safety.’ He drew up his chair very close to mine and began to stare at me again with the same questioning and thoughtful look.\n“A feeling of repulsion, and of something akin to fear had begun to rise within me at the strange antics of this fleshless man. Even my dread of losing a client could not restrain me from showing my impatience.\n“‘I beg that you will state your business, sir,’ said I; ‘my time is of value.’ Heaven forgive me for that last sentence, but the words came to my lips.\n“‘How would fifty guineas for a night’s work suit you?’ he asked.\n“‘Most admirably.’\n“‘I say a night’s work, but an hour’s would be nearer the mark. I simply want your opinion about a hydraulic stamping machine which has got out of gear. If you show us what is wrong we shall soon set it right ourselves. What do you think of such a commission as that?’\n“‘The work appears to be light and the pay munificent.’\n“‘Precisely so. We shall want you to come to-night by the last train.’\n“‘Where to?’\n“‘To Eyford, in Berkshire. It is a little place near the borders of Oxfordshire, and within seven miles of Reading. There is a train from Paddington which would bring you there at about 11:15.’\n“‘Very good.’\n“‘I shall come down in a carriage to meet you.’\n“‘There is a drive, then?’\n“‘Yes, our little place is quite out in the country. It is a good seven miles from Eyford Station.’\n“‘Then we can hardly get there before midnight. I suppose there would be no chance of a train back. I should be compelled to stop the night.’\n“‘Yes, we could easily give you a shake-down.’\n“‘That is very awkward. Could I not come at some more convenient hour?’\n“‘We have judged it best that you should come late. It is to recompense you for any inconvenience that we are paying to you, a young and unknown man, a fee which would buy an opinion from the very heads of your profession. Still, of course, if you would like to draw out of the business, there is plenty of time to do so.’\n“I thought of the fifty guineas, and of how very useful they would be to me. ‘Not at all,’ said I, ‘I shall be very happy to accommodate myself to your wishes. I should like, however, to understand a little more clearly what it is that you wish me to do.’\n“‘Quite so. It is very natural that the pledge of secrecy which we have exacted from you should have aroused your curiosity. I have no wish to commit you to anything without your having it all laid before you. I suppose that we are absolutely safe from eavesdroppers?’\n“‘Entirely.’\n“‘Then the matter stands thus. You are probably aware that fuller’s-earth is a valuable product, and that it is only found in one or two places in England?’\n“‘I have heard so.’\n“‘Some little time ago I bought a small place—a very small place—within ten miles of Reading. I was fortunate enough to discover that there was a deposit of fuller’s-earth in one of my fields. On examining it, however, I found that this deposit was a comparatively small one, and that it formed a link between two very much larger ones upon the right and left—both of them, however, in the grounds of my neighbours. These good people were absolutely ignorant that their land contained that which was quite as valuable as a gold-mine. Naturally, it was to my interest to buy their land before they discovered its true value, but unfortunately I had no capital by which I could do this. I took a few of my friends into the secret, however, and they suggested that we should quietly and secretly work our own little deposit and that in this way we should earn the money which would enable us to buy the neighbouring fields. This we have now been doing for some time, and in order to help us in our operations we erected a hydraulic press. This press, as I have already explained, has got out of order, and we wish your advice upon the subject. We guard our secret very jealously, however, and if it once became known that we had hydraulic engineers coming to our little house, it would soon rouse inquiry, and then, if the facts came out, it would be good-bye to any chance of getting these fields and carrying out our plans. That is why I have made you promise me that you will not tell a human being that you are going to Eyford to-night. I hope that I make it all plain?’\n“‘I quite follow you,’ said I. ‘The only point which I could not quite understand was what use you could make of a hydraulic press in excavating fuller’s-earth, which, as I understand, is dug out like gravel from a pit.’\n“‘Ah!’ said he carelessly, ‘we have our own process. We compress the earth into bricks, so as to remove them without revealing what they are. But that is a mere detail. I have taken you fully into my confidence now, Mr. Hatherley, and I have shown you how I trust you.’ He rose as he spoke. ‘I shall expect you, then, at Eyford at 11:15.’\n“‘I shall certainly be there.’\n“‘And not a word to a soul.’ He looked at me with a last long, questioning gaze, and then, pressing my hand in a cold, dank grasp, he hurried from the room.",

By profession I am a hydraulic engineer, and I have had considerable experience of my work during the two years that I was apprenticed to Messrs. Venner & Matheson, the well-known firm, of Greenwich. Last spring, having served my time, and feeling that I was master of my business, I determined to start in on my own account, and I opened rooms in Victoria Street, hoping that by steady work and perseverance I might honestly earn a living. I can’t say that matters have prospered with me at all. My capital was small, and my clientele even smaller. For months I have had such a struggle to keep body and soul together that I have hardly hoped to succeed. “It was bank holiday last Monday, and I had arranged to go to the Crystal Palace with a friend, when just as I was starting the maid of the house came up to say that a gentleman wished to see me upon business. I was very glad to see him, for it was quite by accident that he had heard of me, and I knew that if I could only get a foot in the door I would soon make a name for myself. He was a very thin, cadaverous man, with a sharp nose and eager, bright eyes. I don’t know that I have ever seen anyone who gave me such a singular impression of nervous energy. He was shabbily dressed, but he had a remarkably rich voice, and a very foreign manner. “‘Mr. Victor Hatherley?’ he asked. “‘That is my name, sir.’ “‘I hear that you are a hydraulic engineer. Is that so?’ “‘I am.’ “‘Are you in practice for yourself?’ “‘I am.’ “‘I was recommended to you, Mr. Hatherley, by my friend, Colonel Lysander Stark, who assures me that you are a man who may be entirely trusted.’ “The name was unknown to me. ‘I have never heard of the gentleman,’ said I. “‘He is an elderly man, with a moustache, and lives near Eyford, in Berkshire.’ “‘No, I know no one of the name.’ “Why, bless my soul, don’t you know Stark’s Hydraulic Press? Why, my dear sir, it comes from his invention.’ “‘It is possible that I have had some dealings with the work, but never with the man.’ “‘Well, he knew all about you, at any rate. He told me that you were the very man for my purpose—provided that you are absolutely silent and discreet, and could keep a still tongue.’ “‘I have always made it a point to be so.’ “‘Do you think that I can trust you? Absolutely, on your honour?’ “‘I think you can.’ “‘Well, then, I will take you into my confidence. I am engaged in a matter of a delicate nature, and of extreme importance. The most perfect secrecy and discretion are absolutely necessary.’ He looked round the room as he spoke, and then he moved his chair closer to mine. ‘I was recommended to you, Mr. Hatherley,’ said he, ‘because you are a bachelor, and live alone in town. All my business has been done through agents hitherto, but I have been so cheated by them in the matter of commission that I have determined to deal directly with the expert. I can assure you that this matter is not a commonplace one, and that it will be worth your while to go out of your way for it.’ “‘At present, of course, I know nothing of the matter, except that absolute secrecy is required. Anything more?’ “‘I want you to come out to my house to-night, and to advise me what to do with a hydraulic press which is out of order. I want you to come at once, as we shall not be able to see what is wrong with it until that time. It is a long way out of town, and it is difficult to get back again in the morning. “‘Then I must remain the night?’ “‘Yes, you must remain the night. It is no great hardship, for I assure you I have ample accommodation, and I can give you a splendid dinner into the bargain.’ “‘Well, I really don’t know,’ said I. ‘When do you want me to start?’ “‘I will send a carriage for you, and it will take you to the station. You had better not take any luggage, for we will be back early in the morning. We will be at the station at ten o’clock.’ “‘I am afraid that I cannot manage it. I have an appointment at that hour.’ “‘Well, then, I will make it later. Say at eleven.’ “‘That is rather late.’ “‘Well, then, say at a quarter past eleven. That will be the last train that stops at Eyford, and I will meet you there.’ “‘Very good,’ said I. ‘I will be there.’ “‘And now,’ said he, ‘as to the terms. I am a man of business, and I like to have everything cut and dried. I will give you fifty guineas for your services, provided that you are absolutely silent and discreet.’ “‘That is very handsome,’ said I. “‘I am glad that you think so. It is a matter of great importance, and I am prepared to pay for it. I am a man of my word, and you may rely upon it that I will keep my promise.’ “‘I am sure of it,’ said I. “‘Well, then, that is settled. I will send a carriage for you at a quarter past eleven, and I will meet you at Eyford.’ “‘Very good,’ said I. “‘And now,’ said he, ‘I must be going. I have a great deal to do.’ He rose as he spoke, and I rose also. He held out his hand, and I took it. It was as cold as ice. ‘Remember,’ said he, ‘absolute secrecy and discretion.’ He gave me a long, steady look, and then he turned and left the room. “I stood for a moment where I was, hardly knowing what to do. I was so astonished at the suddenness of the whole affair that I could hardly collect my thoughts. The man was gone, but the fifty guineas were still in my hand. I had never earned so much in my life before. I was a poor man, and I had been struggling for two years to make a living. This was a godsend to me. I determined to go, come what might. I had promised to be silent and discreet, and I would keep my word. “I had a little time to spare, so I went out and bought a few things that I thought I might need. I got a small bag, and put in a clean shirt and a few other necessaries. I had no idea what sort of place I was going to, but I thought it best to be prepared for anything. I went back to my lodgings, and waited for the carriage. “It came at a quarter past eleven, and I got in. It was a closed carriage, and there were no windows. I could not see where I was going, but I knew that I was going in the direction of the station. We drove for about half an hour, and then we stopped. The driver opened the door, and I got out. I was at the station. “The train was just coming in, and I got into a carriage. There were only a few people in the train, and I had a carriage to myself. I sat down and tried to think, but I could not. My mind was in a whirl. I was going on a strange errand, to a strange place, and with a strange man. I did not know what was going to happen, but I was determined to go through with it. “The train started, and I looked out of the window. It was a dark night, and I could not see anything. I sat back in my seat, and tried to compose myself. I had a long journey before me, and I did not know what was at the end of it. “We stopped at several stations, and people got in and out. At last the train began to slow down, and I knew that we were coming to Eyford. I got up and looked out of the window. I could see a few lights in the distance, and I knew that I was at my journey’s end. “The train stopped, and I got out. There was only one man on the platform, and I knew at once that it was the man who had called upon me in the morning. He came up to me, and held out his hand. ‘Mr. Hatherley?’ he said. “‘That is my name,’ said I. “‘I am glad to see you,’ said he. ‘I have been waiting for you.’ “‘I am glad to be here,’ said I. “‘Well, then,’ said he, ‘we must be going. I have a carriage waiting.’ “He led the way out of the station, and I followed him. There was a carriage waiting, and we got in. It was a closed carriage, and there were no windows. I could not see where I was going, but I knew that I was going in the direction of his house. We drove for about half an hour, and then we stopped. The driver opened the door, and I got out. I was at the house. “It was a large, old-fashioned house, with a garden in front. There were no lights in the windows, and the house looked dark and gloomy. I followed the man into the house, and he led the way into a large room. There was a fire in the grate, and the room was well furnished. There were several chairs and a table, and a large sofa. There were also several pictures on the walls. “The man turned to me, and said, ‘This is my house, Mr. Hatherley. I am glad to welcome you to it.’ “‘Thank you,’ said I. “‘Well, then,’ said he, ‘we must be getting",

By profession I am a hydraulic engineer, and I have had considerable experience of my work during the two years that I was apprenticed to Messrs. Venner & Matheson, the well-known firm, of Greenwich. Last spring, having served my time, and feeling that I was master of my business, I determined to start in on my own account, and I opened rooms in Victoria Street, hoping that by steady work and perseverance I might honestly earn a living. I can’t say that matters have prospered with me at all. My capital was small, and my clientele even smaller. For months I have had such a struggle to keep body and soul together that I have hardly hoped to succeed. “It was bank holiday last Monday, and I had arranged to go to the Crystal Palace with a friend, when just as I was starting the maid of the house came up to say that a gentleman wished to see me upon business. I was very glad to see him, for it was quite by accident that he had heard of me, and I knew that if I could only get a foot in the door I would soon make a name for myself. He was a very thin, cadaverous man, with a sharp nose and eager, bright eyes. I don’t know that I have ever seen anyone who gave me such a singular impression of nervous energy. He was shabbily dressed, but he had a remarkably rich voice, and a very foreign manner. “‘Mr. Victor Hatherley?’ he asked. “‘That is my name, sir.’ “‘I hear that you are a hydraulic engineer. Is that so?’ “‘I am.’ “‘Are you in practice for yourself?’ “‘I am.’ “‘I was recommended to you, Mr. Hatherley, by my friend, Colonel Lysander Stark, who assures me that you are a man who may be entirely trusted.’ “The name was unknown to me. ‘I have never heard of the gentleman,’ said I. “‘He is an elderly man, with a moustache, and lives near Eyford, in Berkshire.’ “‘No, I know no one of the name.’ “Why, bless my soul, don’t you know Stark’s Hydraulic Press? Why, my dear sir, it comes from his invention.’ “‘It is possible that I have had some dealings with the work, but never with the man.’ “‘Well, he knew all about you, at any rate.

On the other hand, the face and manner of my patron had made an unpleasant impression upon me, and I could not think that his explanation of the fuller’s-earth was sufficient to explain the necessity for my coming at midnight, and his extreme anxiety lest I should tell anyone of my errand. However, I threw all fears to the winds, ate a hearty supper, drove to Paddington, and started off, having obeyed to the letter the injunction as to holding my tongue.\n“At Reading I had to change not only my carriage but my station. However, I was in time for the last train to Eyford, and I reached the little dim-lit station after eleven o’clock. I was the only passenger who got out there, and there was no one upon the platform save a single sleepy porter with a lantern. As I passed out through the wicket gate, however, I found my acquaintance of the morning waiting in the shadow upon the other side. Without a word he grasped my arm and hurried me into a carriage, the door of which was standing open. He drew up the windows on either side, tapped on the wood-work, and away we went as fast as the horse could go.”\n“One horse?” interjected Holmes.\n“Yes, only one.”\n“Did you observe the colour?”\n“Yes, I saw it by the side-lights when I was stepping into the carriage.

However, what with the money and what with my curiosity, I at last determined to go. I had an early supper, and at a little after seven o’clock started for Paddington. Before I came to the station I called in a single word to my employer, and was answered that I was to take the 11.15 train. I got my ticket, and was shown into a carriage by a porter.

He sat at my side in silence all the time, and I was aware, more than once when I glanced in his direction, that he was looking at me with great intensity. The country roads seem to be not very good in that part of the world, for we lurched and jolted terribly. I tried to look out of the windows to see something of where we were, but they were made of frosted glass, and I could make out nothing save the occasional bright blur of a passing light. Now and then I hazarded some remark to break the monotony of the journey, but the colonel answered only in monosyllables, and the conversation soon flagged. At last, however, the bumping of the road was exchanged for the crisp smoothness of a gravel-drive, and the carriage came to a stand. Colonel Lysander Stark sprang out, and, as I followed after him, pulled me swiftly into a porch which gaped in front of us. We stepped, as it were, right out of the carriage and into the hall, so that I failed to catch the most fleeting glance of the front of the house. The instant that I had crossed the threshold the door slammed heavily behind us, and I heard faintly the rattle of the wheels as the carriage drove away.\n“It was pitch dark inside the house, and the colonel fumbled about looking for matches and muttering under his breath. Suddenly a door opened at the other end of the passage, and a long, golden bar of light shot out in our direction. It grew broader, and a woman appeared with a lamp in her hand, which she held above her head, pushing her face forward and peering at us. I could see that she was pretty, and from the gloss with which the light shone upon her dark dress I knew that it was a rich material. She spoke a few words in a foreign tongue in a tone as though asking a question, and when my companion answered in a gruff monosyllable she gave such a start that the lamp nearly fell from her hand. Colonel Stark went up to her, whispered something in her ear, and then, pushing her back into the room from whence she had come, he walked towards me again with the lamp in his hand.\n“‘Perhaps you will have the kindness to wait in this room for a few minutes,’ said he, throwing open another door. It was a quiet, little, plainly furnished room, with a round table in the centre, on which several German books were scattered. Colonel Stark laid down the lamp on the top of a harmonium beside the door. ‘I shall not keep you waiting an instant,’ said he, and vanished into the darkness.",

His face was quite invisible, for the collar was turned up to his eyes, and a fur cap was pulled down to his collar. I was silent, and he was silent, until I ventured to make some remark about the weather. He answered in a short, gruff fashion, and then relapsed into silence once more. It was one of the gloomiest journeys that I have ever made. The roads were dreadful, and the carriage jolted about in a heart-breaking fashion. For a long time we seemed to be climbing a very steep hill, and then we rattled down the other side at an equal pace. All the way the wind blew keen, and the frost bit shrewdly. There was never a glimmer of light, and no sound save the rattle of the carriage and the clinking of the horses’ hoofs. Twice our driver stopped for a moment and opened the carriage door, when a puff of cold air and a smell of damp earth told me that he had communicated with someone outside. I knew that we had stopped at some house, but what sort of house I could not imagine. We resumed our journey, and had driven for some time when a sudden jolt told me that we were off the main road. A minute later, and we were on soft ground, which told me that we were driving through grass. Then came another jolt, and we were on a gravel drive, and finally the carriage stopped, and I could hear the horses panting. Colonel Stark sprang out, and, as I followed him, pulled me swiftly into a porch which shut out all view on either side. I could just see a glimmer of light to the right, which seemed to come from the fanlight over a door. The Colonel snatched the lamp from someone, and disappeared through this doorway, leaving me in pitch darkness. The door slammed behind us, and I heard the carriage drive away. I stood in the porch, groping about for a handle, and feeling a draft of cold air upon my face. Suddenly a door opened, and a woman appeared, holding a lamp high in her hand. She was a most beautiful woman, with a pale, spiritual face, and large, dark eyes, which gazed at me with a questioning expression. She was richly dressed, and wore a profusion of jewellery. Her dress was of some dark material, and her hair was of a raven blackness, and hung down in a long braid behind her back. She spoke to me in a foreign language, and I could not understand a word that she said. I shook my head, and she repeated her question. I was about to reply, when Colonel Stark appeared at the door, and said something to her in a low voice. She started, and nearly dropped the lamp. He took it from her, and said to me, “Come this way, Mr. Hatherley.” He led me down a long passage, and then into a small room, which was plainly furnished, but comfortable. There was a fire in the grate, and a lamp on the table. On the table were some books, which I saw by the titles were German. There was also a harmonium in the corner. “You can wait here, Mr. Hatherley,” said the Colonel. “I shall not be long.” He left me, and I heard the door lock behind him.",

          "text_segment": "“I glanced at the books upon the table, and in spite of my ignorance of German I could see that two of them were treatises on science, the others being volumes of poetry. Then I walked across to the window, hoping that I might catch some glimpse of the country-side, but an oak shutter, heavily barred, was folded across it. It was a wonderfully silent house. There was an old clock ticking loudly somewhere in the passage, but otherwise everything was deadly still. A vague feeling of uneasiness began to steal over me. Who were these German people, and what were they doing living in this strange, out-of-the-way place? And where was the place? I was ten miles or so from Eyford, that was all I knew, but whether north, south, east, or west I had no idea. For that matter, Reading, and possibly other large towns, were within that radius, so the place might not be so secluded, after all. Yet it was quite certain, from the absolute stillness, that we were in the country. I paced up and down the room, humming a tune under my breath to keep up my spirits and feeling that I was thoroughly earning my fifty-guinea fee.\n“Suddenly, without any preliminary sound in the midst of the utter stillness, the door of my room swung slowly open. The woman was standing in the aperture, the darkness of the hall behind her, the yellow light from my lamp beating upon her eager and beautiful face. I could see at a glance that she was sick with fear, and the sight sent a chill to my own heart. She held up one shaking finger to warn me to be silent, and she shot a few whispered words of broken English at me, her eyes glancing back, like those of a frightened horse, into the gloom behind her.\n“‘I would go,’ said she, trying hard, as it seemed to me, to speak calmly; ‘I would go. I should not stay here. There is no good for you to do.’\n“‘But, madam,’ said I, ‘I have not yet done what I came for. I cannot possibly leave until I have seen the machine.’\n“‘It is not worth your while to wait,’ she went on. ‘You can pass through the door; no one hinders.’ And then, seeing that I smiled and shook my head, she suddenly threw aside her constraint and made a step forward, with her hands wrung together. ‘For the love of Heaven!’ she whispered, ‘get away from here before it is too late!’\n“But I am somewhat headstrong by nature, and the more ready to engage in an affair when there is some obstacle in the way. I thought of my fifty-guinea fee, of my wearisome journey, and of the unpleasant night which seemed to be before me. Was it all to go for nothing? Why should I slink away without having carried out my commission, and without the payment which was my due? This woman might, for all I knew, be a monomaniac. With a stout bearing, therefore, though her manner had shaken me more than I cared to confess, I still shook my head and declared my intention of remaining where I was. She was about to renew her entreaties when a door slammed overhead, and the sound of several footsteps was heard upon the stairs. She listened for an instant, threw up her hands with a despairing gesture, and vanished as suddenly and as noiselessly as she had come.\n“The newcomers were Colonel Lysander Stark and a short thick man with a chinchilla beard growing out of the creases of his double chin, who was introduced to me as Mr. Ferguson.\n“‘This is my secretary and manager,’ said the colonel. ‘By the way, I was under the impression that I left this door shut just now. I fear that you have felt the draught.’\n“‘On the contrary,’ said I, ‘I opened the door myself because I felt the room to be a little close.’\n“He shot one of his suspicious looks at me. ‘Perhaps we had better proceed to business, then,’ said he. ‘Mr. Ferguson and I will take you up to see the machine.’\n“‘I had better put my hat on, I suppose.’\n“‘Oh, no, it is in the house.’\n“‘What, you dig fuller’s-earth in the house?’\n“‘No, no. This is only where we compress it. But never mind that. All we wish you to do is to examine the machine and to let us know what is wrong with it.’",

A half-finished pot of coffee stood by the grate, and a pipe and tobacco lay upon the mantelpiece. Beside the lamp was a pile of paper, with a number of mathematical calculations scrawled upon it in pencil. It was all dull and commonplace, but none the less on a sudden impulse I approached the window and raised the blind. As I expected, a stout shutter barred all passage, and I felt that I was indeed securely trapped. I was not long left to my meditations. A sudden dread came over me, an undefined fear of the unknown. The moonbeams had drifted away, and a shadow lay athwart the room. The silence was profound, broken only by the ticking of the great clock upon the stairs. It increased my uneasiness, and I felt a strong impulse to open the door and escape into the desolate wood. An instant later I dismissed the idea as cowardly and absurd. I had come there to do a professional job, and I should see it through. I reminded myself that I was acting for a client who had given me a considerable fee, and that it was my duty to do what he asked. Colonel Lysander Stark had been frank enough in the matter. He had confessed that he had a machine for compressing fuller’s-earth, that he wished it kept secret for a month, and that he was prepared to pay me a thousand pounds for my knowledge and discretion. I could not imagine what the machine could be, nor why the secrecy should be so important; but I am not of an inquisitive nature, and I was ready to accept the terms he offered. I had brought my tools with me, and now, picking up a lamp, I had my hand upon the door of the room, when, to my astonishment, it opened from without. A woman stood in the opening, a woman young and pale, with a piteous face and eyes of terror. She was in humble dress, and her manner was that of one in despair. “Oh, sir!” she cried, in broken English, “you must go no stay here there is no good for you.” “Why, my good woman,” I asked, “what is the matter?” She wung her hands and implored me in husky, words to leave at once. “But I have not seen the machine,” I said, “nor earned the fee that was promised me.” “Never mind the fee,” she cried, with a desperate gesture. “It is nothing it is less than nothing save yourself, go away from here before it is too late!” “I am sorry, but I cannot go,” I answered. “I have my agreement with the colonel, and I must see it through.” She implored me with renewed earnestness, wringing her hands and showing every sign of the most desperate alarm. “You cannot tell what it means,” she cried. “You are in danger great danger the greatest danger that ever you were in.” I could not help thinking that she was mad. With her wild eyes and her frantic gestures, she was a strange figure. “I can see no danger, my dear madam,” I said. “What is it you fear?” “I fear them I fear him he will kill you in the end. He will kill you as he killed the others. Oh, I hear him coming! Flee, flee, for Heaven’s sake!” She looked wildly round for some place of concealment, and then, hearing footsteps upon the stairs, she vanished as suddenly as she had come. The door closed behind her, and an instant afterwards Colonel Lysander Stark stood upon the threshold. He was a tall, gaunt man, with a harsh, resonant voice and a peculiarly sallow face. A harsh voice, however, can be cultivated, and a sallow face may come from illness, but a man who gives one thousand pounds for so trifling an affair as this, and gives it, too, with such secrecy and mystery, must have some strong reason for his actions. I did not like his eyes, which were sharp and piercing, and were always darting about in a suspiciously furtive manner. He was undoubtedly a gentleman, for his face, though sallow, was well formed, and his bearing was upright and stately. He held a lamp in his hand, and he peered past me into the room. “What is this?” he asked abruptly. “Why are you not in the sitting-room?” “I came in here to look around,” I answered. “I must confess that I was very curious to see what you were doing in this desolate place.” He shot a side glance at me, his sallow face becoming yellower still. “Perhaps you have heard of my little fad,” he said. “Do you find it curious, sure enough? I thought that you engineers were never surprised at anything.” “I was not surprised, Colonel, it was only that I was curious to know what could be done with fuller’s-earth in so large a scale.” “The question is rather what could be done without it,” he answered, with a sardonic smile. “We have had difficulty enough in finding a competent man to fit the machine. It is time, however, that we were at business. If you will come this way, Mr. Hatherley, we shall go down to the workroom.” “I can assure you that I am quite ready to follow you, Colonel Stark,” said I. “You saved me from a nasty fall just now.” “Yes, I was lucky enough to be near enough to catch you,” he said, as he led the way down a long passage. “We have not a power-lift in this house. One would think that you engineers might find some means of lifting people as well as goods.” “What do you mean?” I asked. “Oh, nothing particular,” he answered. He stopped at a door and beckoned me in. It was a large, bare room, with a number of great machines scattered about",

          "text_segment": "“We went upstairs together, the colonel first with the lamp, the fat manager and I behind him. It was a labyrinth of an old house, with corridors, passages, narrow winding staircases, and little low doors, the thresholds of which were hollowed out by the generations who had crossed them. There were no carpets and no signs of any furniture above the ground floor, while the plaster was peeling off the walls, and the damp was breaking through in green, unhealthy blotches. I tried to put on as unconcerned an air as possible, but I had not forgotten the warnings of the lady, even though I disregarded them, and I kept a keen eye upon my two companions. Ferguson appeared to be a morose and silent man, but I could see from the little that he said that he was at least a fellow-countryman.\n“Colonel Lysander Stark stopped at last before a low door, which he unlocked. Within was a small, square room, in which the three of us could hardly get at one time. Ferguson remained outside, and the colonel ushered me in.\n“‘We are now,’ said he, ‘actually within the hydraulic press, and it would be a particularly unpleasant thing for us if anyone were to turn it on. The ceiling of this small chamber is really the end of the descending piston, and it comes down with the force of many tons upon this metal floor. There are small lateral columns of water outside which receive the force, and which transmit and multiply it in the manner which is familiar to you. The machine goes readily enough, but there is some stiffness in the working of it, and it has lost a little of its force. Perhaps you will have the goodness to look it over and to show us how we can set it right.’\n“I took the lamp from him, and I examined the machine very thoroughly. It was indeed a gigantic one, and capable of exercising enormous pressure. When I passed outside, however, and pressed down the levers which controlled it, I knew at once by the whishing sound that there was a slight leakage, which allowed a regurgitation of water through one of the side cylinders. An examination showed that one of the india-rubber bands which was round the head of a driving-rod had shrunk so as not quite to fill the socket along which it worked. This was clearly the cause of the loss of power, and I pointed it out to my companions, who followed my remarks very carefully and asked several practical questions as to how they should proceed to set it right. When I had made it clear to them, I returned to the main chamber of the machine and took a good look at it to satisfy my own curiosity. It was obvious at a glance that the story of the fuller’s-earth was the merest fabrication, for it would be absurd to suppose that so powerful an engine could be designed for so inadequate a purpose. The walls were of wood, but the floor consisted of a large iron trough, and when I came to examine it I could see a crust of metallic deposit all over it. I had stooped and was scraping at this to see exactly what it was when I heard a muttered exclamation in German and saw the cadaverous face of the colonel looking down at me.\n“‘What are you doing there?’ he asked.\n“I felt angry at having been tricked by so elaborate a story as that which he had told me. ‘I was admiring your fuller’s-earth,’ said I; ‘I think that I should be better able to advise you as to your machine if I knew what the exact purpose was for which it was used.’\n“The instant that I uttered the words I regretted the rashness of my speech. His face set hard, and a baleful light sprang up in his grey eyes.\n“‘Very well,’ said he, ‘you shall know all about the machine.’ He took a step backward, slammed the little door, and turned the key in the lock. I rushed towards it and pulled at the handle, but it was quite secure, and did not give in the least to my kicks and shoves.",

              "simple_agent_extraction": "We went upstairs together, the colonel first with the lamp, the fat manager and I behind him. It was a labyrinth of an old house, with bare passages, damp walls, and nothing to see but naked planks and crumbling plaster. I had a most uneasy feeling at heart, and I kept my hand upon my pocket, where my revolver lay. My two companions walked in front of me, silent and solemn, and the lamp cast giant dancing shadows upon the wall. They were powerful men, both of them, and I knew that if they chose to turn upon me I could expect little mercy. Our ascent seemed never-ending, and the house appeared to be deserted. At last, however, we came to a curious low corridor, and at the end of it a small, low door. Stark stopped and unlocked it. Inside was a small, square chamber, which appeared to be empty. Stark entered it himself, and beckoned me in. 'We shall work here,' said he. 'This is the press itself. You can see that the piston comes down in the centre of the metal floor. The side cylinders are where the water enters it, and these levers and valves control the action.' 'But where is the fuller's-earth?' I asked. 'Oh, I have had it removed. It is not necessary to my explanation. I have been experiencing some difficulty with the working of the machine. An india-rubber band which we had in the side cylinder has shrunk, and allows a leak.' 'What you have to do is to find where the water escapes, and to bung it up.' 'By Jove!' said I, looking at the size of the cylinder, 'it will take a piston the size of a man's head to do that!' 'Precisely. This is it. Put it into the low cylinder, pump ten strokes, and then tell me what you think of it.' I took the lamp from him, and I examined the great machine. It was a magnificent piece of engineering, but it was new to me. I was accustomed to my hydraulic presses being worked by steam. 'When do you use steam?' I asked. 'We have no steam here. We use water power.' 'But where do you get your water power?' 'From the stream outside. It is a very powerful stream.' 'And you have a fall?' 'Yes, a fall of thirty feet.' 'But that is not enough to work this machine.' 'We have a reservoir above, and we get a pressure of a thousand pounds to the square inch.' 'By Jove!' said I again. 'You have a magnificent machine, but it is not working efficiently.' 'No,' said he. 'That is why I sent for you. Now, I will show you how it works.' He went outside the chamber, and I heard him operating the levers. The great piston began to descend slowly and silently. 'It is coming down,' said he. 'Now, you can see the leak.' I examined the side cylinder, and I saw that there was a small jet of water spurting out from the top. 'Ah,' said I, 'I see the problem. The india-rubber band has shrunk, and it is allowing the water to escape.' 'Precisely. What do you advise?' 'You must replace the india-rubber band. It is a simple matter.' 'But I have no india-rubber band of that size.' 'Then you must get one.' 'But I cannot get one here.' 'Then you must send for one.' 'But I cannot wait.' 'Then you must stop the leak in some other way.' 'How?' 'You must bung it up.' 'With what?' 'With anything that will fit.' 'But I have nothing that will fit.' 'Then you must make something that will fit.' 'But I have no tools.' 'Then you must use your hands.' 'But I cannot stop it with my hands.' 'Then you must stop the machine.' 'But I cannot stop the machine.' 'Then you must let it leak.' 'But I cannot let it leak.' 'Then you must do something.' 'What?' 'Anything.' 'But I can do nothing.' 'Then you must die.' 'But I do not want to die.' 'Then you must do something.' 'What?' 'Anything.' 'But I can do nothing.' 'Then you must die.' 'But I do not want to die.' 'Then you must do something.' 'What?'

          "text_segment": "‘Hullo!’ I yelled. ‘Hullo! Colonel! Let me out!’\n“And then suddenly in the silence I heard a sound which sent my heart into my mouth. It was the clank of the levers and the swish of the leaking cylinder. He had set the engine at work. The lamp still stood upon the floor where I had placed it when examining the trough. By its light I saw that the black ceiling was coming down upon me, slowly, jerkily, but, as none knew better than myself, with a force which must within a minute grind me to a shapeless pulp. I threw myself, screaming, against the door, and dragged with my nails at the lock. I implored the colonel to let me out, but the remorseless clanking of the levers drowned my cries. The ceiling was only a foot or two above my head, and with my hand upraised I could feel its hard, rough surface. Then it flashed through my mind that the pain of my death would depend very much upon the position in which I met it. If I lay on my face the weight would come upon my spine, and I shuddered to think of that dreadful snap. Easier the other way, perhaps; and yet, had I the nerve to lie and look up at that deadly black shadow wavering down upon me? Already I was unable to stand erect, when my eye caught something which brought a gush of hope back to my heart.\n“I have said that though the floor and ceiling were of iron, the walls were of wood. As I gave a last hurried glance around, I saw a thin line of yellow light between two of the boards, which broadened and broadened as a small panel was pushed backward. For an instant I could hardly believe that here was indeed a door which led away from death. The next instant I threw myself through, and lay half-fainting upon the other side. The panel had closed again behind me, but the crash of the lamp, and a few moments afterwards the clang of the two slabs of metal, told me how narrow had been my escape.\n“I was recalled to myself by a frantic plucking at my wrist, and I found myself lying upon the stone floor of a narrow corridor, while a woman bent over me and tugged at me with her left hand, while she held a candle in her right. It was the same good friend whose warning I had so foolishly rejected.\n“‘Come! come!’ she cried breathlessly. ‘They will be here in a moment. They will see that you are not there. Oh, do not waste the so-precious time, but come!’\n“This time, at least, I did not scorn her advice. I staggered to my feet and ran with her along the corridor and down a winding stair. The latter led to another broad passage, and just as we reached it we heard the sound of running feet and the shouting of two voices, one answering the other from the floor on which we were and from the one beneath. My guide stopped and looked about her like one who is at her wit’s end. Then she threw open a door which led into a bedroom, through the window of which the moon was shining brightly.\n“‘It is your only chance,’ said she. ‘It is high, but it may be that you can jump it.’\n“As she spoke a light sprang into view at the further end of the passage, and I saw the lean figure of Colonel Lysander Stark rushing forward with a lantern in one hand and a weapon like a butcher’s cleaver in the other. I rushed across the bedroom, flung open the window, and looked out. How quiet and sweet and wholesome the garden looked in the moonlight, and it could not be more than thirty feet down. I clambered out upon the sill, but I hesitated to jump until I should have heard what passed between my saviour and the ruffian who pursued me. If she were ill-used, then at any risks I was determined to go back to her assistance. The thought had hardly flashed through my mind before he was at the door, pushing his way past her; but she threw her arms round him and tried to hold him back.\n“‘Fritz! Fritz!’ she cried in English, ‘remember your promise after the last time. You said it should not be again. He will be silent! Oh, he will be silent!’\n“‘You are mad, Elise!’ he shouted, struggling to break away from her. ‘You will be the ruin of us. He has seen too much. Let me pass, I say!’ He dashed her to one side, and, rushing to the window, cut at me with his heavy weapon. I had let myself go, and was hanging by the hands to the sill, when his blow fell. I was conscious of a dull pain, my grip loosened, and I fell into the garden below.\n“I was shaken but not hurt by the fall; so I picked myself up and rushed off among the bushes as hard as I could run, for I understood that I was far from being out of danger yet. Suddenly, however, as I ran, a deadly dizziness and sickness came over me. I glanced down at my hand, which was throbbing painfully, and then, for the first time, saw that my thumb had been cut off and that the blood was pouring from my wound. I endeavoured to tie my handkerchief round it, but there came a sudden buzzing in my ears, and next moment I fell in a dead faint among the rose-bushes.",

I had been so excited by the adventure that I had not given it a thought, but now I remembered that this was what Stark had said was the purpose of his machinery. I shuddered at the thought of it, and yet, in my ignorance, I had not realised its terrors. The thing had started at some distance away, and every instant the smooth, oily piston was sliding further and further into the torture-chamber of which I was the doomed occupant. And every instant it was coming nearer me. I screamed and raved and beat the iron door, but the rattle of the machinery drowned my voice, and the thick iron plates mocked all my efforts. I shrieked as I saw the long piston rod pushing its way remorselessly towards me. I knew that death was coming upon me slowly but surely. Still, for a long time, I hoped that there might be some escape, but as I looked round me I saw that the four walls of the tiny chamber were all of metal, and that the floor, too, was of metal.

            "prefix-probing": "‘Hullo!’ I yelled. ‘Hullo! Colonel! Let me out!’ My voice echoed back at me from the solid oak door, thick and unyielding, that stood between me and the outside world. I hammered upon it with my fists, a futile gesture that only served to bruise my knuckles and deepen my sense of impotent rage. The room was small, sparsely furnished, and utterly devoid of any obvious means of escape. A single window, high up and barred, offered a tantalising glimpse of a grey sky, but was far beyond my reach. The air was stale, carrying the faint, unpleasant odour of damp plaster and something else… something metallic and faintly sweet, like old blood. My mind raced, trying to piece together the events that had led me to this predicament. Only an hour ago, I had been walking down a quiet London street, enjoying the crisp autumn air, when a sudden blow to the back of my head had sent me sprawling into darkness. I awoke here, in this cell-like room, with a throbbing skull and a profound sense of disorientation. Who had done this? And why? I racked my brains, trying to recall any recent encounters, any enemies I might have made, but nothing came to mind. I was a doctor, a quiet man of routine, not one to attract the attention of villains. Unless… unless this had something to do with Holmes. It was always Holmes, wasn’t it? His cases had a way of drawing one into the most extraordinary and often perilous situations. Had I stumbled upon something I shouldn’t have seen? Had I been mistaken for someone else? Or was I merely a pawn in some larger, more sinister game? I paced the small room, my boots echoing on the bare floorboards. Three steps one way, three steps back. It was maddening. I examined the walls, running my hands over the rough surface, searching for any loose bricks, any hidden panels, anything that might offer a way out. There was nothing. The door was solid, the frame set deep into the wall. The lock, though I could not see it, felt substantial, a heavy mechanism designed to keep someone in, or out, with absolute certainty. I pressed my ear against the wood, listening intently. Silence. Absolute, unnerving silence. It was as if the house, indeed the entire world, had fallen silent around this one small room. Where was the Colonel? I had heard his voice just before I lost consciousness, giving orders, sharp and clipped. He was the one responsible for my current predicament, I was certain of it. But why address him now? Perhaps he was still nearby. Perhaps he would hear my cries. Or perhaps, more likely, he was long gone, leaving me to whatever fate he had planned. A cold knot of fear tightened in my stomach. I was trapped, alone, and at the mercy of persons unknown. My thoughts turned to Holmes. What would he do in this situation? He would not panic, that was certain. He would observe, deduce, analyse. He would find the one small detail, the one overlooked clue, that would unlock the mystery. I tried to emulate him, forcing myself to calm down, to look at the room with a detective’s eye. What could I learn from my surroundings? The room was clean, almost sterile, save for the faint dust motes dancing in the single shaft of light from the high window. There was a small, uncomfortable-looking chair in one corner, a bare wooden table in the centre, and a jug of water and a tin mug upon it. I went to the table, my hands trembling slightly. The jug was half full, the water cool and clean. I poured some into the mug and drank, the liquid a welcome relief to my dry throat. As I set the mug down, my eyes fell upon the table itself. It was old, scarred with countless nicks and scratches. But one set of marks caught my eye. Faintly etched into the surface, almost invisible unless you looked closely, were a series of small, irregular lines. They looked almost like… letters? Or perhaps symbols? I leaned closer, my heart beginning to beat faster. They were indeed letters, crudely scratched into the wood, as if by a fingernail or a small, sharp object. I traced them with my finger, trying to make them out. The light was poor, and the scratches were shallow, but I could just discern a pattern. It was a message! Left by a previous occupant, perhaps? A warning? A clue? My mind worked furiously, trying to decipher the cryptic inscription. It was a simple cipher, I realised, a substitution code. Each symbol represented a letter. With renewed hope, I set about the task of cracking it. It took time, my brain still foggy from the blow, but gradually, the message began to reveal itself. It was short, only a few words, but its meaning sent a fresh wave of fear through me. It was a warning, just as I had suspected. A warning about the Colonel, about the house, and about the fate that awaited those who were brought here. The message was stark, chilling in its simplicity. It spoke of a hidden passage, a way out, but also of a terrible danger that lay beyond. It mentioned a specific time, a deadline, after which escape would be impossible. I looked up at the high window, then back at the door. The silence outside seemed heavier now, more menacing. I had to get out. I had to find this hidden passage. And I had to do it before the time ran out. My eyes scanned the room again, searching for anything that might correspond to the cryptic directions in the message. The walls, the floor, the ceiling – where could a hidden passage be concealed in such a small, bare room? The message had mentioned a"

My clothes were all sodden with dew, and my coat-sleeve was drenched with blood from my wounded thumb. The smarting of it recalled in an instant all the particulars of my night’s adventure, and I sprang to my feet with the feeling that I might hardly yet be safe from my pursuers. But to my astonishment, when I came to look round me, neither house nor garden were to be seen. I had been lying in an angle of the hedge close by the high road, and just a little lower down was a long building, which proved, upon my approaching it, to be the very station at which I had arrived upon the previous night. Were it not for the ugly wound upon my hand, all that had passed during those dreadful hours might have been an evil dream.\n“Half dazed, I went into the station and asked about the morning train. There would be one to Reading in less than an hour. The same porter was on duty, I found, as had been there when I arrived. I inquired of him whether he had ever heard of Colonel Lysander Stark. The name was strange to him. Had he observed a carriage the night before waiting for me? No, he had not. Was there a police-station anywhere near? There was one about three miles off.\n“It was too far for me to go, weak and ill as I was. I determined to wait until I got back to town before telling my story to the police. It was a little past six when I arrived, so I went first to have my wound dressed, and then the doctor was kind enough to bring me along here. I put the case into your hands and shall do exactly what you advise.”\nWe both sat in silence for some little time after listening to this extraordinary narrative. Then Sherlock Holmes pulled down from the shelf one of the ponderous commonplace books in which he placed his cuttings.\n“Here is an advertisement which will interest you,” said he. “It appeared in all the papers about a year ago. Listen to this: ‘Lost, on the 9th inst., Mr. Jeremiah Hayling, aged twenty-six, a hydraulic engineer. Left his lodgings at ten o’clock at night, and has not been heard of since. Was dressed in,’ etc., etc. Ha! That represents the last time that the colonel needed to have his machine overhauled, I fancy.”\n“Good heavens!” cried my patient. “Then that explains what the girl said.”\n“Undoubtedly. It is quite clear that the colonel was a cool and desperate man, who was absolutely determined that nothing should stand in the way of his little game, like those out-and-out pirates who will leave no survivor from a captured ship.",

I spent some minutes in trying to recall what had happened. I knew that there had been an accident, and I knew also that some great misfortune had overtaken me.

The door was open, and I passed out into the sweet morning air. There was a garden in front, and beyond it a country road, which wound away into a dense wood. The house was a small one, plainly furnished, and with no pretensions to gentility. As I looked at it I knew that I had never seen it before. Suddenly the door opened, and a little woman came out with a pail in her hand, and stood for a moment blinking in the bright sunlight.

My limbs were cold and stiff, my clothes were wet with dew, and a horrid aching pain shot from my shoulder down my arm. I sat up and felt the bandage round my head. My sleeve was stiff with blood and was torn up to the shoulder. There was no sign of a house near me, nor of any garden. I was in a meadow by the side of the road. A dense wood was on the other side, and a light blue smoke curled up from behind the trees, showing where the house lay. My mind was dazed and confused. I knew that something horrible had happened, and I knew that I had escaped from it. My thumb pained me dreadfully, and instinctively I felt for my hand. There was a broad bandage round it, and, as well as I could feel in the dark, it seemed to be fearfully mangled. I sat up in the meadow, and wrung my hands in despair. I was cold, weary, and in pain, and knew not what to do. I was about to crawl into the wood and conceal myself when I caught sight of the down train steaming in the distance. I remembered the Eyford station, and staggered to my feet. The road was clear, and I tottered along it, hardly able to put one foot before the other. I had not gone more than a hundred yards when I saw a small cottage, and beyond it the railway lines. I tottered on, and at last reached the station. There was a porter on the platform. I knew him again. I had seen him when I arrived the night before. I staggered up to him. “I want to go to London,” I said. “The next train is due in an hour,” he said. “Can I wait here?” I asked. “You can wait in the waiting-room,” he said, looking at me curiously. He was a burly, red-faced fellow, and his eyes were fixed upon my bloody sleeve and my bandaged head. “What has happened to you?” he asked. “I have met with an accident,” I said. “I suppose a carriage was waiting for you last night?” he asked. “No,” I said. “I came by the train.” “Oh, did you?” he said. “I thought I saw a carriage waiting. Well, you can wait in the waiting-room.” He led me into the little room, and I sat down upon the bench. I was so weak and faint that I could hardly speak. I asked him if there was a doctor near. He said that there was one in the village, but that it was three miles away. I asked him if there was a police station. He said that there was one at Reading, but that it was twelve miles away. I saw that I could get no help there, so I resolved to go on to London. I had a few shillings in my pocket, and I knew that I could get a train to Reading, and from there to London. I sat in the waiting-room, and shivered with the cold. At last the train came, and I got into a carriage. I was the only passenger. I lay back in the corner, and closed my eyes. I was in a dreadful state of pain and exhaustion. I reached Reading at six o’clock, and got a train to London. I arrived at Paddington at eight o’clock. I was so weak that I could hardly stand. I took a cab, and drove to Dr. Watson’s house. I rang the bell, and the door was opened by a servant. I asked if Dr. Watson was at home. She said that he was, and I was shown into the consulting-room. Dr. Watson was sitting at his desk. He rose when he saw me. “My dear fellow,” he cried, “what has happened to you?” I told him in a few words what had occurred. He was greatly shocked. He examined my hand, and shook his head. “This is a terrible injury,” he said. “You must have immediate attention.” He rang the bell, and ordered his carriage. “We will go to Mr. Sherlock Holmes,” he said. “He will be able to help you.” We drove to Baker Street, and I was shown into Mr. Holmes’s room. He was sitting in his armchair, with his pipe in his mouth. He rose when he saw me. “My dear Watson,” he said, “you have brought me a patient. What is the matter?” “This is Mr. Hatherley,” said Watson. “He has met with a terrible accident.” Holmes looked at me keenly. “You have been in a bad way,” he said. “Sit down, and tell me all about it.” I sat down, and told him the whole story, from the time that I had left London until I had arrived at Dr. Watson’s house. He listened with the greatest attention, and",

There were Sherlock Holmes, the hydraulic engineer, Inspector Bradstreet, of Scotland Yard, a plain-clothes man, and myself. Bradstreet had spread an ordnance map of the county out upon the seat and was busy with his compasses drawing a circle with Eyford for its centre.\n“There you are,” said he. “That circle is drawn at a radius of ten miles from the village. The place we want must be somewhere near that line. You said ten miles, I think, sir.”\n“It was an hour’s good drive.”\n“And you think that they brought you back all that way when you were unconscious?”\n“They must have done so. I have a confused memory, too, of having been lifted and conveyed somewhere.”\n“What I cannot understand,” said I, “is why they should have spared you when they found you lying fainting in the garden. Perhaps the villain was softened by the woman’s entreaties.”\n“I hardly think that likely. I never saw a more inexorable face in my life.”\n“Oh, we shall soon clear up all that,” said Bradstreet. “Well, I have drawn my circle, and I only wish I knew at what point upon it the folk that we are in search of are to be found.”\n“I think I could lay my finger on it,” said Holmes quietly.\n“Really, now!” cried the inspector, “you have formed your opinion! Come, now, we shall see who agrees with you. I say it is south, for the country is more deserted there.”\n“And I say east,” said my patient.\n“I am for west,” remarked the plain-clothes man. “There are several quiet little villages up there.”\n“And I am for north,” said I, “because there are no hills there, and our friend says that he did not notice the carriage go up any.”\n“Come,” cried the inspector, laughing; “it’s a very pretty diversity of opinion. We have boxed the compass among us. Who do you give your casting vote to?”\n“You are all wrong.”\n“But we can’t all be.”\n“Oh, yes, you can. This is my point.” He placed his finger in the centre of the circle. “This is where we shall find them.”\n“But the twelve-mile drive?” gasped Hatherley.\n“Six out and six back. Nothing simpler. You say yourself that the horse was fresh and glossy when you got in. How could it be that if it had gone twelve miles over heavy roads?”\n“Indeed, it is a likely ruse enough,” observed Bradstreet thoughtfully. “Of course there can be no doubt as to the nature of this gang.”\n“None at all,” said Holmes. “They are coiners on a large scale, and have used the machine to form the amalgam which has taken the place of silver.”\n“We have known for some time that a clever gang was at work,” said the inspector. “They have been turning out half-crowns by the thousand. We even traced them as far as Reading, but could get no farther, for they had covered their traces in a way that showed that they were very old hands. But now, thanks to this lucky chance, I think that we have got them right enough.”",

Inspector Bradstreet, of Scotland Yard, had been summoned, and we had two plain-clothes men in the guard’s van. Mr. Hatherley was deadly pale, and hardly strong enough to support the journey, but his spirit was as brave as ever. In answer to the questions of the inspector, he repeated his statement as he had already made it to Holmes and myself.\n\n“You say that you drove back to the station,” asked Bradstreet.\n\n“Yes, the lady drove me.”\n\n“And how far was it?”\n\n“About twelve miles, I should think.”\n\n“And you returned in about the same time as you went?”\n\n“About the same.”\n\n“Well, it was twelve o’clock when you started, and six in the morning when you arrived. It would not take six hours to drive twelve miles, however bad the roads.”\n\n“The roads were very bad.”\n\n“Even so. And you were unconscious?”\n\n“I felt very sick, and faint, and giddy. I was quite helpless, and knew nothing about it.”\n\n“And yet you say the lady drove you to the station?”\n\n“By the time we reached it my senses were beginning to come back, and I was able to ask the driver to stop.”\n\n“Who then was driving you?”\n\n“A woman.”\n\n“That is strange. Had she been in the box-seat all the time?”\n\n“I really don’t know. I was in no condition to observe.”\n\n“You say that when you returned your senses were returning. Could you tell anything about the woman who was driving you?”\n\n“I was hardly conscious, but I remember the sweep of her dress and the touch of her hand, and felt that she was a woman.”\n\n“Did she speak?”\n\n“No, she never spoke a word.”\n\n“And you have no idea of her appearance?”\n\n“Not the slightest.”\n\n“This is puzzling,” said the inspector, staring at his note-book. “Of course, she might have been the woman you saw in the house, but she might also have been some accomplice.”\n\n“Quite so,” said Holmes. “And now, Mr. Hatherley, as we enter the Eyford district, it would be well that we should look over our map, and see if we can tint the scene of the mystery.” He produced a large ordnance map, and spread it out upon our knees. “What was the name of the nearest village to the house, do you remember?”\n\n“Eyford, I think.”\n\n“Good. You observe this ten-mile circle drawn round Eyford. Now, this ring is twelve miles across, and you said that you drove twelve miles. So, if you really drove from Eyford, and your calculation is correct, the house must be somewhere upon that circle. Can you indicate the point?”\n\n“The road was blocked on the other side of the house,” said Hatherley. “But it may be my memory is at fault, for I was greatly confused.”\n\n“Let us consider the points. You said that the drive was an hour long, and the distance twelve miles.”\n\n“Yes, I think so.”\n\n“And you returned in about the same time?”\n\n“Yes.”\n\n“Then the house is twelve miles out.”\n\n“I think so.”\n\n“Now, look at the map. You see that the road from Eyford runs north, and then curves round to the west. Is that the road you took?”\n\n“I think so. I am not sure.”\n\n“Well, at any rate, the house is twelve miles out. Now, can you give us any idea of the direction?”\n\n“I think it was to the east.”\n\n“To the east! That is strange. The road runs north and west.”\n\n“I am not sure. I was so confused.”\n\n“Well, we shall soon clear it up,” said Bradstreet. “We have a man at the station, and he will make inquiries. Meanwhile, let us look at the map again. You say the house is twelve miles out. Now, where on this circle do you think it",

As we rolled into Eyford Station we saw a gigantic column of smoke which streamed up from behind a small clump of trees in the neighbourhood and hung like an immense ostrich feather over the landscape.\n“A house on fire?” asked Bradstreet as the train steamed off again on its way.\n“Yes, sir!” said the station-master.\n“When did it break out?”\n“I hear that it was during the night, sir, but it has got worse, and the whole place is in a blaze.”\n“Whose house is it?”\n“Dr. Becher’s.”\n“Tell me,” broke in the engineer, “is Dr. Becher a German, very thin, with a long, sharp nose?”\nThe station-master laughed heartily. “No, sir, Dr. Becher is an Englishman, and there isn’t a man in the parish who has a better-lined waistcoat.

That second window is the one that I jumped from.”\n“Well, at least,” said Holmes, “you have had your revenge upon them. There can be no question that it was your oil-lamp which, when it was crushed in the press, set fire to the wooden walls, though no doubt they were too excited in the chase after you to observe it at the time.

            "prefix-probing": "But the inspector was mistaken, for those criminals were not destined to fall into the hands of justice. Inspector Gregson, a man of considerable energy but limited imagination, had been so certain of his quarry. He had surrounded the dilapidated warehouse on the riverside with a cordon of constables, convinced that the notorious 'River Rats' gang, responsible for a string of audacious dockside robberies, were trapped within. He had even brought a small boat to intercept any attempt to escape by water. Yet, as dawn broke and the order to storm the building was given, they found it empty, save for a few scattered crates and the lingering smell of cheap tobacco.\n\nHolmes, whom I had accompanied at Gregson's reluctant request, merely smiled faintly as the inspector fumed. \"They were here, Gregson, of that I have no doubt,\" he remarked, examining a faint scuff mark on the floor. \"But they are not here now. Your net, while wide, had a hole in it.\" He pointed out subtle signs that Gregson had overlooked – a peculiar arrangement of ropes near a high window, a faint trail of mud leading not towards the river, but inland, towards a disused railway siding. The gang had not attempted a frontal escape or a river dash; they had used their intimate knowledge of the area to slip away through an unexpected route, perhaps even before the cordon was fully established, disguised amongst the early morning workers or hidden in a passing goods wagon.\n\nThe inspector was crestfallen. Another case, seemingly solved, had slipped through his fingers. The 'River Rats' remained at large, their ill-gotten gains secure, at least for the time being. Holmes offered a few more observations on the gang's methods and potential future movements, but the trail was cold, the opportunity lost. It was a stark reminder that even the most careful police work could be undone by the cunning and local knowledge of determined criminals, a fact that Holmes understood perhaps better than anyone at Scotland Yard."

Early that morning a peasant had met a cart containing several people and some very bulky boxes driving rapidly in the direction of Reading, but there all traces of the fugitives disappeared, and even Holmes’ ingenuity failed ever to discover the least clue as to their whereabouts.\nThe firemen had been much perturbed at the strange arrangements which they had found within, and still more so by discovering a newly severed human thumb upon a window-sill of the second floor. About sunset, however, their efforts were at last successful, and they subdued the flames, but not before the roof had fallen in, and the whole place been reduced to such absolute ruin that, save some twisted cylinders and iron piping, not a trace remained of the machinery which had cost our unfortunate acquaintance so dearly. Large masses of nickel and of tin were discovered stored in an out-house, but no coins were to be found, which may have explained the presence of those bulky boxes which have been already referred to.\nHow our hydraulic engineer had been conveyed from the garden to the spot where he recovered his senses might have remained forever a mystery were it not for the soft mould, which told us a very plain tale. He had evidently been carried down by two persons, one of whom had remarkably small feet and the other unusually large ones. On the whole, it was most probable that the silent Englishman, being less bold or less murderous than his companion, had assisted the woman to bear the unconscious man out of the way of danger.\n“Well,” said our engineer ruefully as we took our seats to return once more to London, “it has been a pretty business for me! I have lost my thumb and I have lost a fifty-guinea fee, and what have I gained?”\n“Experience,” said Holmes, laughing. “Indirectly it may be of value, you know; you have only to put it into words to gain the reputation of being excellent company for the remainder of your existence.”",

With that instinct of the chase which is so strong in him, he did not hesitate an instant, but, boarding a special train, we were soon speeding down to Reading. We hired a trap at the station, and in a little over an hour were at the scene of the fire. A county policeman was on guard, and was evidently much puzzled by the turn which affairs had taken. Of course, he had no idea as to the original cause of the fire, but he knew that a farmer had reported to him, early in the morning, that flames were breaking from the back of the old house on the elm-shaded hill. He had spread the alarm, and had hastened to the spot with several constables and a fire-engine. By the time they arrived, the blaze was so fierce that they could not approach the back of the building, and they had some difficulty in preventing it from spreading to the adjacent wood. By ten o’clock, however, they had mastered it, and the danger was over. It appears that a countryman had seen a cart, containing several people and some very bulky boxes, driving at a furious pace down the lane to the station, and he had reported the matter to the police. On examining the ruins, however, there was nothing to show the destination of the fugitives, or to throw any light upon the matter. There were the charred beams and blackened walls, and about them the débris of the fire, but nothing more. It was at the corner of the second floor that the policeman in charge had made his discovery. There, on the window-sill, was the dried pool of blood, and beside it the severed thumb. He shuddered as he held it up, for the bony away of the thumb was protruding from the fleshy pad. We examined it at our leisure and Holmes pronounced it to have been severed by a heavy cleaver or chisel. “This is all that is left of my hand,” said Hatherley, and he sank back in a dead faint. We bore him to the trap, and drove to the inn at Reading, where he was carefully attended to. On our return to the house, we examined the ruins more closely. The machinery was all destroyed, but the fire had not reached the outhouse, and there we found the large quantities of nickel and tin. It was evident that the coins had been removed in the bulky boxes which the countryman had seen upon the cart. We also found the footprints of two men and a woman in the soft earth near the garden bed, and we concluded that the woman and one of the men had carried the unconscious Hatherley to the roadside. “It is a pity,” said Holmes, as we drove back to town, “that we have not been able to lay our hands upon these rascals. It is probable that the woman and the Englishman, being less ruthless than the German, had some compunction, and so helped you to safety. But, at any rate, you have had a most remarkable experience, and you have gained a story which will make you famous for life.” “I have lost my thumb, and I have lost fifty guineas,” said Hatherley. “But I have gained experience,” said Holmes, with a smile. “And that, after all, is the main thing. When you tell your story, you will be the most sought-after man in London. You will be a lion, Mr. Hatherley, a perfect lion.” And so, indeed, he was. For years afterwards, I heard of him as the man who had lost his thumb and gained a fortune, not in money, but in fame.",

                "text": "And Holmes’ fears came to be realised, for from that day to this no word has ever been heard either of the beautiful woman, the sinister German, or the morose Englishman. With that instinct of the chase which is so strong in him, he did not hesitate an instant, but, boarding a special train, we were soon speeding down to Reading. We hired a trap at the station, and in a little over an hour were at the scene of the fire. A county policeman was on guard, and was evidently much puzzled by the turn which affairs had taken. Of course, he had no idea as to the original cause of the fire, but he knew that a farmer had reported to him, early in the morning, that flames were breaking from the back of the old house on the elm-shaded hill. He had spread the alarm, and had hastened to the spot with several constables and a fire-engine. By the time they arrived, the blaze was so fierce that they could not approach the back of the building, and they had some difficulty in preventing it from spreading to the adjacent wood. By ten o’clock, however, they had mastered it, and the danger was over. It appears that a countryman had seen a cart, containing several people and some very bulky boxes, driving at a furious pace down the lane to the station, and he had reported the matter to the police. On examining the ruins, however, there was nothing to show the destination of the fugitives, or to throw any light upon the matter. There were the charred beams and blackened walls, and about them the débris of the fire, but nothing more. It was at the corner of the second floor that the policeman in charge had made his discovery. There, on the window-sill, was the dried pool of blood, and beside it the severed thumb. He shuddered as he held it up, for the bony away of the thumb was protruding from the fleshy pad. We examined it at our leisure and Holmes pronounced it to have been severed by a heavy cleaver or chisel. “This is all that is left of my hand,” said Hatherley, and he sank back in a dead faint. We bore him to the trap, and drove to the inn at Reading, where he was carefully attended to. On our return to the house, we examined the ruins more closely. The machinery was all destroyed, but the fire had not reached the outhouse, and there we found the large quantities of nickel and tin. It was evident that the coins had been removed in the bulky boxes which the countryman had seen upon the cart. We also found the footprints of two men and a woman in the soft earth near the garden bed, and we concluded that the woman and one of the men had carried the unconscious Hatherley to the roadside. “It is a pity,” said Holmes, as we drove back to town, “that we have not been able to lay our hands upon these rascals.

Fresh scandals have eclipsed it, and their more piquant details have drawn the gossips away from this four-year-old drama. As I have reason to believe, however, that the full facts have never been revealed to the general public, and as my friend Sherlock Holmes had a considerable share in clearing the matter up, I feel that no memoir of him would be complete without some little sketch of this remarkable episode.\nIt was a few weeks before my own marriage, during the days when I was still sharing rooms with Holmes in Baker Street, that he came home from an afternoon stroll to find a letter on the table waiting for him. I had remained indoors all day, for the weather had taken a sudden turn to rain, with high autumnal winds, and the jezail bullet which I had brought back in one of my limbs as a relic of my Afghan campaign throbbed with dull persistence. With my body in one easy-chair and my legs upon another, I had surrounded myself with a cloud of newspapers until at last, saturated with the news of the day, I tossed them all aside and lay listless, watching the huge crest and monogram upon the envelope upon the table and wondering lazily who my friend’s noble correspondent could be.\n“Here is a very fashionable epistle,” I remarked as he entered. “Your morning letters, if I remember right, were from a fish-monger and a tide-waiter.”\n“Yes, my correspondence has certainly the charm of variety,” he answered, smiling, “and the humbler are usually the more interesting. This looks like one of those unwelcome social summonses which call upon a man either to be bored or to lie.”\nHe broke the seal and glanced over the contents.\n“Oh, come, it may prove to be something of interest, after all.”\n“Not social, then?”\n“No, distinctly professional.”\n“And from a noble client?”\n“One of the highest in England.”\n“My dear fellow, I congratulate you.”\n“I assure you, Watson, without affectation, that the status of my client is a matter of less moment to me than the interest of his case. It is just possible, however, that that also may not be wanting in this new investigation. You have been reading the papers diligently of late, have you not?”\n“It looks like it,” said I ruefully, pointing to a huge bundle in the corner. “I have had nothing else to do.”\n“It is fortunate, for you will perhaps be able to post me up. I read nothing except the criminal news and the agony column. The latter is always instructive. But if you have followed recent events so closely you must have read about Lord St. Simon and his wedding?”\n“Oh, yes, with the deepest interest.”",

Fresh scandals have eclipsed it, and fresh sensations have caused it to be forgotten. Very brief was the period during which the public interest was universally aroused. Rarely had so dramatic a romance come our way. It fell, however, into my hands, as did my friend Sherlock Holmes’s memoirs, from time to time; and, by his permission, I add it to the strange cases which it has been my lot to chronicle. A few weeks before the date of my marriage, Sherlock Holmes and I had settled down to the quiet routine of our life together at Baker Street. I had had a severe bout of illness, and was still weak from the attack; but the spring was warming into summer, and a few days of genial weather would restore me to my strength. For a week or two I was confined to the house, and had no other amusement than that which Holmes could furnish me, by his incursion into the strange problems which were submitted to him. One Tuesday afternoon we were sitting in our little sitting-room, the blinds drawn, and the fire lit, for it was an exceptionally cold spring day. From the window I could see the wet, muddy street, and the yellow fog which hung thickly over the housetops, descending in an occasional drizzle upon the grimy sidewalks. My convalescence appeared to be retarded by the dreariness of my surroundings. “Well, Watson, you balance the accounts very neatly,” said Holmes, laying down his pen and leaning back in his chair. “I should not have thought a feckless soldier was capable of it.” “I have always had a turn for figures,” I answered. “You remember that I pushed my calculations to a unit, and discovered the amount of your tradesman’s account in the year ’82.” Holmes gave a laugh and threw his cigar into the fire. “From a number of delicate little deductions of the kind, my dear Watson, I fancy that I have garnered the idea that you have some slight turn for figures—a turn, too, which I never suspected with regard to women. Here is an instance which is quite to the point. Pray, can you tell me what has happened to the letter which began with ‘A’ and which came by the eleven o’clock post?” “I was about to ring for the maid when you entered,” I said. “You mean the one with the coronet upon it?” “Precisely. When I saw the coronet I was very much afraid that you were about to plunge into some new aristocratic tangle. These devilish coronets are always bringing trouble upon us.” “You say that before you have even seen the letter,” I answered. “Ah, my dear Watson, I can see letters by the метр. So long as they are legibly addressed, I can tell you a good deal about them. For example, by the colour of the paper, and the quality of the paper, I can say at a glance whether the writer is doing well in the world, or the reverse. Again, the scent tells me a tale, and even the shape of the flap or the way the gum is spread is often enough to give me a clue. Here is an envelope with a coronet, and with the Dacre stamp upon the outside. That is a ninepenny stamp, and, as you are aware, they are only used upon letters of importance. The address, too, is in a lady’s hand, and very firm and clear it is. But, apart from all this, the very fact that a lady of rank should write to me and of her own accord, too, without any prior correspondence, shows that it is no ordinary matter. But here is the letter itself. I have no doubt that it is the Duchess of Dacre, and that it is about the disappearance of her son, the Duke, who was last seen at the Carlton Club on Tuesday night.” “No, no, my dear fellow, you are all wrong this time,” said I, triumphantly. “It is not a lady’s hand at all; it is a gentleman’s, and you can see the coronet is that of a marquis, not a duke. It is Lord St. Simon’s paper, and I have no doubt that it is about the disappearance of his bride.” Holmes glanced at the envelope, and then at the letter. “By Jove, Watson, you are right!” said he. “It is Lord St. Simon’s paper, and it is a gentleman’s hand. I confess that I am surprised. I had no idea that he was a client of mine.” “You have had no communication with him, then?” “None whatever. I have been following the case in the newspapers, and I confess that I have been very much interested in it. That a man should marry a woman one day, and that she should disappear the next, is a romance which is quite to my taste. The bride, too, is an American, which makes it the more curious. I confess that I am very much afraid that it is a case which will be beyond my powers.” “You have no doubt that it is the same case?” “None whatever. The date, the coronet, the name, the stamp, all correspond. It is the Lord St. Simon marriage, and I have no doubt that it is about the disappearance of his bride.”",

I will read it to you, and in return you must turn over these papers and let me have whatever bears upon the matter. This is what he says:\n“‘MY DEAR MR. SHERLOCK HOLMES,—Lord Backwater tells me that I may place implicit reliance upon your judgment and discretion. I have determined, therefore, to call upon you and to consult you in reference to the very painful event which has occurred in connection with my wedding. Mr. Lestrade, of Scotland Yard, is acting already in the matter, but he assures me that he sees no objection to your co-operation, and that he even thinks that it might be of some assistance. I will call at four o’clock in the afternoon, and, should you have any other engagement at that time, I hope that you will postpone it, as this matter is of paramount importance. Yours faithfully,\n“‘ROBERT ST. SIMON.’\n“It is dated from Grosvenor Mansions, written with a quill pen, and the noble lord has had the misfortune to get a smear of ink upon the outer side of his right little finger,” remarked Holmes as he folded up the epistle.\n“He says four o’clock. It is three now. He will be here in an hour.”\n“Then I have just time, with your assistance, to get clear upon the subject. Turn over those papers and arrange the extracts in their order of time, while I take a glance as to who our client is.” He picked a red-covered volume from a line of books of reference beside the mantelpiece. “Here he is,” said he, sitting down and flattening it out upon his knee. “‘Lord Robert Walsingham de Vere St. Simon, second son of the Duke of Balmoral.’ Hum! ‘Arms: Azure, three caltrops in chief over a fess sable. Born in 1846.’ He’s forty-one years of age, which is mature for marriage. Was Under-Secretary for the colonies in a late administration. The Duke, his father, was at one time Secretary for Foreign Affairs. They inherit Plantagenet blood by direct descent, and Tudor on the distaff side. Ha! Well, there is nothing very instructive in all this. I think that I must turn to you Watson, for something more solid.”\n“I have very little difficulty in finding what I want,” said I, “for the facts are quite recent, and the matter struck me as remarkable. I feared to refer them to you, however, as I knew that you had an inquiry on hand and that you disliked the intrusion of other matters.”\n“Oh, you mean the little problem of the Grosvenor Square furniture van. That is quite cleared up now—though, indeed, it was obvious from the first. Pray give me the results of your newspaper selections.”\n“Here is the first notice which I can find. It is in the personal column of the Morning Post, and dates, as you see, some weeks back: ‘A marriage has been arranged,’ it says, ‘and will, if rumour is correct, very shortly take place, between Lord Robert St. Simon, second son of the Duke of Balmoral, and Miss Hatty Doran, the only daughter of Aloysius Doran. Esq., of San Francisco, Cal., U.S.A.’ That is all.”\n“Terse and to the point,” remarked Holmes, stretching his long, thin legs towards the fire.\n“There was a paragraph amplifying this in one of the society papers of the same week. Ah, here it is: ‘There will soon be a call for protection in the marriage market, for the present free-trade principle appears to tell heavily against our home product. One by one the management of the noble houses of Great Britain is passing into the hands of our fair cousins from across the Atlantic. An important addition has been made during the last week to the list of the prizes which have been borne away by these charming invaders. Lord St. Simon, who has shown himself for over twenty years proof against the little god’s arrows, has now definitely announced his approaching marriage with Miss Hatty Doran, the fascinating daughter of a California millionaire. Miss Doran, whose graceful figure and striking face attracted much attention at the Westbury House festivities, is an only child, and it is currently reported that her dowry will run to considerably over the six figures, with expectancies for the future. As it is an open secret that the Duke of Balmoral has been compelled to sell his pictures within the last few years, and as Lord St. Simon has no property of his own save the small estate of Birchmoor, it is obvious that the Californian heiress is not the only gainer by an alliance which will enable her to make the easy and common transition from a Republican lady to a British peeress.’”\n“Anything else?” asked Holmes, yawning.\n“Oh, yes; plenty. Then there is another note in the Morning Post to say that the marriage would be an absolutely quiet one, that it would be at St. George’s, Hanover Square, that only half a dozen intimate friends would be invited, and that the party would return to the furnished house at Lancaster Gate which has been taken by Mr. Aloysius Doran. Two days later—that is, on Wednesday last—there is a curt announcement that the wedding had taken place, and that the honeymoon would be passed at Lord Backwater’s place, near Petersfield. Those are all the notices which appeared before the disappearance of the bride.”\n“Before the what?” asked Holmes with a start.\n“The vanishing of the lady.”\n“When did she vanish, then?”\n“At the wedding breakfast.”\n“Indeed. This is more interesting than it promised to be; quite dramatic, in fact.”\n“Yes; it struck me as being a little out of the common.”\n“They often vanish before the ceremony, and occasionally during the honeymoon; but I cannot call to mind anything quite so prompt as this. Pray let me have the details.”",

              "simple_agent_extraction": "That is well. The letter is from Lord Robert St. Simon. I can see his crest on the envelope. You know the name, no doubt, and the circumstances. The wedding took place yesterday. ‘Dear Mr. Holmes,’ it says, ‘I have no doubt that you have seen the account in the papers of the singular and painful occurrence which has darkened my life. If you will drop me a line I shall be happy to call upon you at four o’clock to-morrow, and to furnish you with every detail which may be of assistance to you in forming an opinion upon the matter. Believe me to be, with high esteem, yours faithfully, Robert St. Simon.’ Hum! This gentleman disappears upon his wedding-day. He is an elderly man, but the bride is young. ‘Extremely painful occurrence, and singular.’ That is the word. I fancy that the singular and painful part of it is that the lady should have disappeared. Was there anything in the papers about it? I perceive that you have them all there.’ He passed one of his long, thin fingers down a column. ‘“The marriage of Lord Robert St. Simon with Miss Hatty Doran was solemnised,”’ he read. ‘Hum! This must be the fellow who is just engaged.’ ‘No,’ said I, ‘this is the very man. I have here three papers, all of which contain accounts of the wedding.’ ‘Indeed! That is very important. Excuse me for a moment.’ He pushed the papers over to me, and I glanced at them while he hurried to his desk and came back with a great red-covered book. ‘“Lord Robert St. Simon, second son of the Duke of Balmoral,”’ he read. ‘“He was born in 1845. Was Under-Secretary for the Colonies in a former Administration. The Duke, his father, was at one time Privy Seal. The family of Balmoral has been one of the most ancient in the kingdom, though poverty has compelled the present Duke to sell the greater part of the estates. Lord Robert has never married, and it is rumoured that he is considerably in debt. Hum! This is all I can find. Do you see anything else, Watson?’ I had been glancing over the papers which he had passed over to me. ‘Yes,’ I said, ‘there is a good deal about it here. Lord Robert St. Simon married Miss Hatty Doran, the only daughter of Aloysius Doran, Esq., of San Francisco, U.S.A. The wedding took place at St. George’s, Hanover Square. The bride was given away by the Right Hon. Lord Bellamy, K.C.S.I. The bridegroom was attended by the Hon. Philip Forrester. Sir Archibald Forbes and Mr. Forgie were among the company. Afterwards the company proceeded to the residence of Mr. Aloysius Doran, 10, Lancaster Gate, where the wedding breakfast took place. Dancing followed. This account is from the Morning Post.’ ‘Ah, the Morning Post is indiscreet, but usually accurate,’ said Holmes. ‘And what do the others say?’ ‘The Daily Telegraph remarks that in this age of democracy and equality it is interesting to note that the representatives of our old aristocracy are still able to command the fairest maidens and the largest fortunes. Miss Doran, being the only child of a Californian millionaire, is expected to have a very large fortune, and it is rumoured that she will inherit an even larger one at the death of her father. She is a sweet little lady, with a beautiful face and a very graceful figure. There is a charming little portrait of her in the paper. “The Duke of Balmoral, who was unable to be present, owing to indisposition, was represented by his eldest son, Lord Balmoral.”’ ‘Hum! He seems to be a sickly Duke,’ said Holmes. ‘And now the third paper?’ ‘The Pall Mall Gazette has just half a column, and ends with a curt notice that Lord Robert St. Simon and his bride started for Petersfield, Hants, that same afternoon, and it is believed that their honeymoon will be spent at some country-seat in that neighbourhood. That is all.’ ‘And these papers are ten days old.’ ‘Yes, ten days old.’ ‘Then this disappearance of the bride took place ten days ago?’ ‘Yes, about that date.’ ‘And you say that she disappeared from the wedding breakfast?’ ‘Yes, that is so.’ ‘She simply vanished away from the face of the earth?’ ‘Well, that hardly expresses it. She was there at the wedding breakfast.’ ‘And afterwards?’ ‘The bridegroom went down to the grounds to smoke a cigarette and when he came back she was gone.’ ‘Exactly. Gone from the wedding breakfast, and ten days have elapsed. During that time the bridegroom has made no sign?’ ‘There has been a fresh development. To-day’s papers are full of it.’ ‘Indeed! What is it?’ ‘An American gentleman named Aloysius Doran called upon the Yard last night and reported a complete failure in recovering his daughter. He has instituted inquiries in every direction without result.’ ‘And the Yard?’ ‘Well, Lestrade is on the case. He was round here at ten o’clock this morning.’ ‘You didn’t mention it.’ ‘Well, I didn’t know that you would take any particular interest in it. But, however, I may tell you that he looked upon the matter as a simple disappearance, and was inclined to think that the lady had suddenly altered her mind upon the brink of marriage, and had simply walked off to amuse herself.’ ‘Excellent, Lestrade! Excellent!’ said Holmes. ‘When the bride vanishes from the wedding breakfast, and the bridegroom is a peer, the thing may develop into something of interest. What else had he to say?’ ‘He would not admit that it was anything more than an ordinary disappearance. He seemed to be much annoyed that anyone should imagine that it was anything else. I asked him if he had seen the bridegroom. He said that he had just come from him. He did not see any trace of excitement or agitation in him. He seemed to be taking the matter very quietly, though he was, of course, very much concerned. He was a man of about forty, middle-sized, and with a clean-shaven, thoughtful face. He was dressed in a dark suit, and wore a black tie. He was a man of considerable wealth, and had a large house in Lancaster Gate.

                "text": "That is well. The letter is from Lord Robert St. Simon. I can see his crest on the envelope. You know the name, no doubt, and the circumstances. The wedding took place yesterday. ‘Dear Mr. Holmes,’ it says, ‘I have no doubt that you have seen the account in the papers of the singular and painful occurrence which has darkened my life. If you will drop me a line I shall be happy to call upon you at four o’clock to-morrow, and to furnish you with every detail which may be of assistance to you in forming an opinion upon the matter. Believe me to be, with high esteem, yours faithfully, Robert St. Simon.’ Hum! This gentleman disappears upon his wedding-day. He is an elderly man, but the bride is young. ‘Extremely painful occurrence, and singular.’ That is the word. I fancy that the singular and painful part of it is that the lady should have disappeared. Was there anything in the papers about it? I perceive that you have them all there.’ He passed one of his long, thin fingers down a column. ‘“The marriage of Lord Robert St. Simon with Miss Hatty Doran was solemnised,”’ he read. ‘Hum! This must be the fellow who is just engaged.’ ‘No,’ said I, ‘this is the very man. I have here three papers, all of which contain accounts of the wedding.’ ‘Indeed! That is very important. Excuse me for a moment.’ He pushed the papers over to me, and I glanced at them while he hurried to his desk and came back with a great red-covered book. ‘“Lord Robert St. Simon, second son of the Duke of Balmoral,”’ he read. ‘“He was born in 1845. Was Under-Secretary for the Colonies in a former Administration. The Duke, his father, was at one time Privy Seal. The family of Balmoral has been one of the most ancient in the kingdom, though poverty has compelled the present Duke to sell the greater part of the estates. Lord Robert has never married, and it is rumoured that he is considerably in debt. Hum! This is all I can find. Do you see anything else, Watson?’ I had been glancing over the papers which he had passed over to me. ‘Yes,’ I said, ‘there is a good deal about it here. Lord Robert St. Simon married Miss Hatty Doran, the only daughter of Aloysius Doran, Esq., of San Francisco, U.S.A. The wedding took place at St. George’s, Hanover Square. The bride was given away by the Right Hon. Lord Bellamy, K.C.S.I. The bridegroom was attended by the Hon. Philip Forrester. Sir Archibald Forbes and Mr. Forgie were among the company. Afterwards the company proceeded to the residence of Mr. Aloysius Doran, 10, Lancaster Gate, where the wedding breakfast took place. Dancing followed. This account is from the Morning Post.’ ‘Ah, the Morning Post is indiscreet, but usually accurate,’ said Holmes. ‘And what do the others say?’ ‘The Daily Telegraph remarks that in this age of democracy and equality it is interesting to note that the representatives of our old aristocracy are still able to command the fairest maidens and the largest fortunes. Miss Doran, being the only child of a Californian millionaire, is expected to have a very large fortune, and it is rumoured that she will inherit an even larger one at the death of her father. She is a sweet little lady, with a beautiful face and a very graceful figure. There is a charming little portrait of her in the paper. “The Duke of Balmoral, who was unable to be present, owing to indisposition, was represented by his eldest son, Lord Balmoral.”’ ‘Hum! He seems to be a sickly Duke,’ said Holmes. ‘And now the third paper?’ ‘The Pall Mall Gazette has just half a column, and ends with a curt notice that Lord Robert St. Simon and his bride started for Petersfield, Hants, that same afternoon, and it is believed that their honeymoon will be spent at some country-seat in that neighbourhood. That is all.’ ‘And these papers are ten days old.’ ‘Yes, ten days old.’ ‘Then this disappearance of the bride took place ten days ago?’ ‘Yes, about that date.’ ‘And you say that she disappeared from the wedding breakfast?’ ‘Yes, that is so.’ ‘She simply vanished away from the face of the earth?’ ‘Well, that hardly expresses it. She was there at the wedding breakfast.’ ‘And afterwards?’ ‘The bridegroom went down to the grounds to smoke a cigarette and when he came back she was gone.’ ‘Exactly. Gone from the wedding breakfast, and ten days have elapsed. During that time the bridegroom has made no sign?’ ‘There has been a fresh development. To-day’s papers are full of it.’ ‘Indeed! What is it?’ ‘An American gentleman named Aloysius Doran called upon the Yard last night and reported a complete failure in recovering his daughter. He has instituted inquiries in every direction without result.’ ‘And the Yard?’ ‘Well, Lestrade is on the case. He was round here at ten o’clock this morning.’ ‘You didn’t mention it.’ ‘Well, I didn’t know that you would take any particular interest in it. But, however, I may tell you that he looked upon the matter as a simple disappearance, and was inclined to think that the lady had suddenly altered her mind upon the brink of marriage, and had simply walked off to amuse herself.’ ‘Excellent, Lestrade!

It is headed, ‘Singular Occurrence at a Fashionable Wedding’:\n“‘The family of Lord Robert St. Simon has been thrown into the greatest consternation by the strange and painful episodes which have taken place in connection with his wedding. The ceremony, as shortly announced in the papers of yesterday, occurred on the previous morning; but it is only now that it has been possible to confirm the strange rumours which have been so persistently floating about. In spite of the attempts of the friends to hush the matter up, so much public attention has now been drawn to it that no good purpose can be served by affecting to disregard what is a common subject for conversation.\n“‘The ceremony, which was performed at St. George’s, Hanover Square, was a very quiet one, no one being present save the father of the bride, Mr. Aloysius Doran, the Duchess of Balmoral, Lord Backwater, Lord Eustace and Lady Clara St. Simon (the younger brother and sister of the bridegroom), and Lady Alicia Whittington. The whole party proceeded afterwards to the house of Mr. Aloysius Doran, at Lancaster Gate, where breakfast had been prepared. It appears that some little trouble was caused by a woman, whose name has not been ascertained, who endeavoured to force her way into the house after the bridal party, alleging that she had some claim upon Lord St. Simon. It was only after a painful and prolonged scene that she was ejected by the butler and the footman. The bride, who had fortunately entered the house before this unpleasant interruption, had sat down to breakfast with the rest, when she complained of a sudden indisposition and retired to her room. Her prolonged absence having caused some comment, her father followed her, but learned from her maid that she had only come up to her chamber for an instant, caught up an ulster and bonnet, and hurried down to the passage. One of the footmen declared that he had seen a lady leave the house thus apparelled, but had refused to credit that it was his mistress, believing her to be with the company. On ascertaining that his daughter had disappeared, Mr. Aloysius Doran, in conjunction with the bridegroom, instantly put themselves in communication with the police, and very energetic inquiries are being made, which will probably result in a speedy clearing up of this very singular business. Up to a late hour last night, however, nothing had transpired as to the whereabouts of the missing lady. There are rumours of foul play in the matter, and it is said that the police have caused the arrest of the woman who had caused the original disturbance, in the belief that, from jealousy or some other motive, she may have been concerned in the strange disappearance of the bride.’”\n“And is that all?”\n“Only one little item in another of the morning papers, but it is a suggestive one.”\n“And it is—”\n“That Miss Flora Millar, the lady who had caused the disturbance, has actually been arrested. It appears that she was formerly a danseuse at the Allegro, and that she has known the bridegroom for some years. There are no further particulars, and the whole case is in your hands now—so far as it has been set forth in the public press.”\n“And an exceedingly interesting case it appears to be.",

Pray read me the account in the paper.”\nI picked up the Daily Telegraph, which was the first of the papers which had been handed to me. “Here is the account,” I said, and I read it aloud to him:\n\n“SINGULAR OCCURRENCE AT A FASHIONABLE WEDDING.\n\n“The quiet wedding of Lord Robert St. Simon, second son of the Duke of Balmoral, with Miss Hatty Doran, the only daughter of Aloysius Doran, Esq., of San Francisco, whose regrettable absence from the ceremony, owing to sudden indisposition, was so much deplored, was celebrated at St. George’s, Hanover Square, yesterday. The ceremony was long overdue, but it is well known that difficulties of a legal nature and in connection with settlements have delayed it in the past. Both families are of great wealth, and the union is one of the most important of the year from a social point of view. It was observed that only five of the fashionable guests invited were present, and it is believed that some misunderstanding at the eleventh hour has occurred. The noble bridegroom was accompanied by his father, the Duke of Balmoral, and supported by the Honourable Philip Green, while the bride was given away by Lord Backwater, who brought a note from the indisposed father. The bridegroom and his best man drove straight to the church from Lord Backwater’s house, where they had spent the morning. A small knot of the bride’s friends waited at the corner of Haunch of Venison Yard, but were dispersed as soon as the carriage passed. The happy pair then drove to Lord Backwater’s house, where a déjeuner was served. An entirely unexpected and painful incident occurred at the door of the house. Lord St. Simon’s carriage had driven up, and the company were descending, when a woman suddenly dashed out of the crowd, which had assembled outside, and rushed in among the little group of ladies who were alighting. She endeavoured to force her way into the house, but was held back by the butler and one of the footmen. She was loudly asserting that she held a claim upon Lord St. Simon, and that he had done her a great injury. There was a terrible scene, which was increased by her violent struggles and her piercing screams. Many of the gentlemen came out upon the steps to see what was the matter, and among them was the noble bridegroom. The woman pointed him out, and went off into a fresh paroxysm of screaming, shaking her fists at him and calling him many vile names. Eventually she was dragged away by the attendants, and disappeared in the crowd. The déjeuner was a most melancholy affair, and the bride was evidently suffering from the effects of the disagreeable scene. In the afternoon Lord St. Simon went down to the City to the office of the firm of Merridew, Son, and Linton, the famous lawyers, with whom his father has long had business relations. In the meantime the bride had remained at Lord Backwater’s house. After resting in her room for a short time, she came down dressed to go out, and, leaving the house, called a cab, and drove away. There is no doubt that she had not intended to do this, for she had ordered her carriage to be at the door at four o’clock. She had evidently acted upon some sudden impulse. As it was raining heavily and was exceedingly cold, she had flung a crimson-lined ulster, which belonged to Lord Backwater, over her untidy dress. She had no hat or bonnet, but wore a red silk muffler over her head. In this guise she was seen by several people to drive away in a four-wheeler with a grey horse. Lord St. Simon returned to the house at half-past four. When he heard that the bride had gone out alone in a cab, his face blanched, and he appeared to be on the point of fainting.

Do not dream of going, Watson, for I very much prefer having a witness, if only as a check to my own memory.”\n“Lord Robert St. Simon,” announced our page-boy, throwing open the door. A gentleman entered, with a pleasant, cultured face, high-nosed and pale, with something perhaps of petulance about the mouth, and with the steady, well-opened eye of a man whose pleasant lot it had ever been to command and to be obeyed. His manner was brisk, and yet his general appearance gave an undue impression of age, for he had a slight forward stoop and a little bend of the knees as he walked. His hair, too, as he swept off his very curly-brimmed hat, was grizzled round the edges and thin upon the top. As to his dress, it was careful to the verge of foppishness, with high collar, black frock-coat, white waistcoat, yellow gloves, patent-leather shoes, and light-coloured gaiters. He advanced slowly into the room, turning his head from left to right, and swinging in his right hand the cord which held his golden eyeglasses.\n“Good-day, Lord St. Simon,” said Holmes, rising and bowing. “Pray take the basket-chair. This is my friend and colleague, Dr. Watson. Draw up a little to the fire, and we will talk this matter over.”\n“A most painful matter to me, as you can most readily imagine, Mr. Holmes. I have been cut to the quick. I understand that you have already managed several delicate cases of this sort, sir, though I presume that they were hardly from the same class of society.”\n“No, I am descending.”\n“I beg pardon.”\n“My last client of the sort was a king.”\n“Oh, really! I had no idea. And which king?”\n“The King of Scandinavia.”\n“What! Had he lost his wife?”\n“You can understand,” said Holmes suavely, “that I extend to the affairs of my other clients the same secrecy which I promise to you in yours.”\n“Of course! Very right! very right! I’m sure I beg pardon. As to my own case, I am ready to give you any information which may assist you in forming an opinion.”\n“Thank you. I have already learned all that is in the public prints, nothing more. I presume that I may take it as correct—this article, for example, as to the disappearance of the bride.”\nLord St. Simon glanced over it. “Yes, it is correct, as far as it goes.”\n“But it needs a great deal of supplementing before anyone could offer an opinion. I think that I may arrive at my facts most directly by questioning you.”\n“Pray do so.”\n“When did you first meet Miss Hatty Doran?”\n“In San Francisco, a year ago.”\n“You were travelling in the States?”\n“Yes.”\n“Did you become engaged then?”\n“No.”\n“But you were on a friendly footing?”\n“I was amused by her society, and she could see that I was amused.”\n“Her father is very rich?”\n“He is said to be the richest man on the Pacific slope.”\n“And how did he make his money?”\n“In mining. He had nothing a few years ago. Then he struck gold, invested it, and came up by leaps and bounds.”\n“Now, what is your own impression as to the young lady’s—your wife’s character?”\nThe nobleman swung his glasses a little faster and stared down into the fire. “You see, Mr. Holmes,” said he, “my wife was twenty before her father became a rich man. During that time she ran free in a mining camp and wandered through woods or mountains, so that her education has come from Nature rather than from the schoolmaster. She is what we call in England a tomboy, with a strong nature, wild and free, unfettered by any sort of traditions. She is impetuous—volcanic, I was about to say. She is swift in making up her mind and fearless in carrying out her resolutions. On the other hand, I would not have given her the name which I have the honour to bear”—he gave a little stately cough—“had I not thought her to be at bottom a noble woman. I believe that she is capable of heroic self-sacrifice and that anything dishonourable would be repugnant to her.”\n“Have you her photograph?”\n“I brought this with me.” He opened a locket and showed us the full face of a very lovely woman. It was not a photograph but an ivory miniature, and the artist had brought out the full effect of the lustrous black hair, the large dark eyes, and the exquisite mouth. Holmes gazed long and earnestly at it. Then he closed the locket and handed it back to Lord St. Simon.\n“The young lady came to London, then, and you renewed your acquaintance?”\n“Yes, her father brought her over for this last London season. I met her several times, became engaged to her, and have now married her.”\n“She brought, I understand, a considerable dowry?”\n“A fair dowry. Not more than is usual in my family.”\n“And this, of course, remains to you, since the marriage is a fait accompli?”\n“I really have made no inquiries on the subject.”\n“Very naturally not. Did you see Miss Doran on the day before the wedding?”\n“Yes.”\n“Was she in good spirits?”\n“Never better. She kept talking of what we should do in our future lives.”\n“Indeed! That is very interesting. And on the morning of the wedding?”\n“She was as bright as possible—at least until after the ceremony.”\n“And did you observe any change in her then?”\n“Well, to tell the truth, I saw then the first signs that I had ever seen that her temper was just a little sharp. The incident however, was too trivial to relate and can have no possible bearing upon the case.”\n“Pray let us have it, for all that.”\n“Oh, it is childish. She dropped her bouquet as we went towards the vestry. She was passing the front pew at the time, and it fell over into the pew. There was a moment’s delay, but the gentleman in the pew handed it up to her again, and it did not appear to be the worse for the fall. Yet when I spoke to her of the matter, she answered me abruptly; and in the carriage, on our way home, she seemed absurdly agitated over this trifling cause.”\n“Indeed! You say that there was a gentleman in the pew. Some of the general public were present, then?”\n“Oh, yes. It is impossible to exclude them when the church is open.”\n“This gentleman was not one of your wife’s friends?”\n“No, no; I call him a gentleman by courtesy, but he was quite a common-looking person. I hardly noticed his appearance. But really I think that we are wandering rather far from the point.”\n“Lady St. Simon, then, returned from the wedding in a less cheerful frame of mind than she had gone to it. What did she do on re-entering her father’s house?”",

His manner was easy and elegant, and he offered his hand with a frank smile. \"Good-evening, Mr. Holmes,\" said he. \"I am afraid I am a little late, but I hope that you will make every allowance for me in the most terrible strait in which a man could find himself.\"\n\n\"I have read something of it, my lord,\" said Holmes. \"I understand that you are Lord Robert St. Simon.\"\n\n\"A bachelor, as you perceive,\" said the client, with a wry face. \"And it is my bachelorhood which I hope that you will preserve.\"\n\n\"You are very welcome to my services, whether you are a bachelor or not, my lord,\" said Holmes. \"Pray sit down and tell me what has occurred. I may tell you that I have had a wire from Lady Francis Carfax, your mother, to say that you are coming. We are at your service.\"\n\n\"It is a very extraordinary affair, this disappearance of my bride,\" said Lord Robert, sinking into the armchair. \"You will understand that I am not a man who is given to panic, but when I tell you that I have not the faintest idea what has become of her, and that there is no possible clue, you will allow that my position is an alarming one.\"\n\n\"I have seen the account in the papers,\" said Holmes. \"Pray tell me the facts in your own words.\"\n\n\"Well, then, I must begin by telling you that I am not a rich man,\" said Lord Robert. \"I am the second son of the Duke of Balmoral, but I have no expectations beyond the allowance which my father makes me, and which is, I may say, a very liberal one. I have been engaged for some years to Lady Clara St. Clair, the daughter of the Earl of Durham, but the engagement was broken off by mutual consent about six months ago. I was very much cut up about it, and I went abroad to try and forget it. I travelled in America, and I was in San Francisco when I met Miss Hatty Doran.\"\n\n\"You interest me extremely,\" said Holmes. \"Pray give me some particulars about this young lady.\"\n\n\"She was the daughter of Aloysius Doran, who is a great Californian millionaire,\" said Lord Robert. \"He made his money in the mines, and he is a rough, uneducated man, but he is as good as gold. His daughter is a very beautiful girl, and she is as good as she is beautiful. She is a little wild and unconventional, perhaps, but she is as pure as a lily, and as true as steel. We met at a ball, and I was very much struck by her. We saw a good deal of each other, and I fell in love with her. I proposed to her, and she accepted me. Her father was very much pleased, and he gave his consent. We were married in London yesterday.\"\n\n\"I have read that,\" said Holmes. \"Pray continue.\"\n\n\"We were married at St. George's, Hanover Square,\" said Lord Robert. \"It was a very quiet wedding, as we had no relatives in London. There were only a few friends present. After the ceremony, we drove to the station, and we were going to spend our honeymoon at my place in the country. But when we got to the station, my wife was not there.\"\n\n\"Not there!\" cried Holmes.\n\n\"No, sir, she was not there. I waited for her for an hour, but she did not come. I made inquiries, but no one had seen her. I went back to the church, but it was empty. I went to her father's house, but she was not there either. I have not seen her since.\"\n\n\"This is a very strange story,\" said Holmes. \"Pray tell me all that you can remember about the wedding.\"\n\n\"Well, sir,\" said Lord Robert, \"everything went off very well until we came to the church. As we were going in, there was a little incident which I did not think much of at the time, but which may have some bearing upon the matter. As my wife was getting out of the carriage, she dropped her bouquet. It fell into the pew which was occupied by a man who was sitting there. He was a common-looking fellow, and he picked up the bouquet and handed it to her. She seemed to be a little agitated about it, but I did not pay much attention to it at the time.\"\n\n\"Do you know who the man was?\" asked Holmes.\n\n\"No, sir, I have no idea. He was a stranger to me.\"\n\n\"What did he look like?\"\n\n\"He was a middle-aged man, with a dark beard and a sallow face. He was dressed in a dark suit, and he had a top-hat on.\"\n\n\"Did you see him again?\"\n\n\"No, sir, I did not.\"\n\n\"Did your wife speak to him?\"\n\n\"No, sir, she did not.\"\n\n\"Did she seem to know him?\"\n\n\"I cannot say. She seemed to be a little agitated, as I have said, but I did not notice anything else.\"\n\n\"Very good,\" said Holmes. \"Pray continue your story.\"\n\n\"Well, sir,\" said Lord Robert, \"after the ceremony, we drove to the station, and we were going to take the train to my place in the country. But when we got to the station, my wife was not there.\"\n\n\"You have told me that already,\" said Holmes. \"Pray tell me what happened next.\"\n\n\"Well, sir,\" said Lord Robert, \"I waited for her for an hour, but she did not come.

She is an American and came from California with her.”\n“A confidential servant?”\n“A little too much so. It seemed to me that her mistress allowed her to take great liberties. Still, of course, in America they look upon these things in a different way.”\n“How long did she speak to this Alice?”\n“Oh, a few minutes. I had something else to think of.”\n“You did not overhear what they said?”\n“Lady St. Simon said something about ‘jumping a claim.’ She was accustomed to use slang of the kind. I have no idea what she meant.”\n“American slang is very expressive sometimes. And what did your wife do when she finished speaking to her maid?”\n“She walked into the breakfast-room.”\n“On your arm?”\n“No, alone. She was very independent in little matters like that. Then, after we had sat down for ten minutes or so, she rose hurriedly, muttered some words of apology, and left the room. She never came back.”\n“But this maid, Alice, as I understand, deposes that she went to her room, covered her bride’s dress with a long ulster, put on a bonnet, and went out.”\n“Quite so. And she was afterwards seen walking into Hyde Park in company with Flora Millar, a woman who is now in custody, and who had already made a disturbance at Mr. Doran’s house that morning.”\n“Ah, yes. I should like a few particulars as to this young lady, and your relations to her.”\nLord St. Simon shrugged his shoulders and raised his eyebrows. “We have been on a friendly footing for some years—I may say on a very friendly footing. She used to be at the Allegro. I have not treated her ungenerously, and she had no just cause of complaint against me, but you know what women are, Mr. Holmes. Flora was a dear little thing, but exceedingly hot-headed and devotedly attached to me. She wrote me dreadful letters when she heard that I was about to be married, and, to tell the truth, the reason why I had the marriage celebrated so quietly was that I feared lest there might be a scandal in the church. She came to Mr. Doran’s door just after we returned, and she endeavoured to push her way in, uttering very abusive expressions towards my wife, and even threatening her, but I had foreseen the possibility of something of the sort, and I had two police fellows there in private clothes, who soon pushed her out again. She was quiet when she saw that there was no good in making a row.”\n“Did your wife hear all this?”\n“No, thank goodness, she did not.”\n“And she was seen walking with this very woman afterwards?”\n“Yes. That is what Mr. Lestrade, of Scotland Yard, looks upon as so serious. It is thought that Flora decoyed my wife out and laid some terrible trap for her.”\n“Well, it is a possible supposition.”\n“You think so, too?”\n“I did not say a probable one. But you do not yourself look upon this as likely?”\n“I do not think Flora would hurt a fly.”\n“Still, jealousy is a strange transformer of characters. Pray what is your own theory as to what took place?”\n“Well, really, I came to seek a theory, not to propound one. I have given you all the facts. Since you ask me, however, I may say that it has occurred to me as possible that the excitement of this affair, the consciousness that she had made so immense a social stride, had the effect of causing some little nervous disturbance in my wife.”\n“In short, that she had become suddenly deranged?”\n“Well, really, when I consider that she has turned her back—I will not say upon me, but upon so much that many have aspired to without success—I can hardly explain it in any other fashion.”\n“Well, certainly that is also a conceivable hypothesis,” said Holmes, smiling. “And now, Lord St. Simon, I think that I have nearly all my data. May I ask whether you were seated at the breakfast-table so that you could see out of the window?”\n“We could see the other side of the road and the Park.”\n“Quite so. Then I do not think that I need to detain you longer. I shall communicate with you.”",

I was in my bedroom, when I heard her voice and her maid's. I thought she was giving directions about her boxes. I heard her say, 'I'll be back in ten minutes. Don't speak to anyone about my having gone.' And then I heard the maid say, 'All right, madam. You can depend upon my keeping mum.' Lord St. Simon flushed a little as he repeated the last words. 'It seemed to me that there was an unnecessary air of secrecy about it, and I confess that I was a little hurt that she should arrange matters in this way without consulting me. I said nothing, however, but came straight down to the breakfast-room. She was not there, so I waited for her. Presently I heard a footman enter the hall and heard him say, 'Mr. Lestrade, sir, and Mr. Sherlock Holmes.' I had no idea that anyone was coming, and I confess that I was considerably startled when they walked in. You have heard the rest of the story from them. They have no doubt told you about the note.' 'Yes, I have heard about the note. It seems to me to complicate matters exceedingly. Kindly tell us a little more about this American lady, Lord St. Simon. Besides this maid, Alice, are you aware that she had any female acquaintances in London?' 'She had fewer acquaintances of any sort than any woman I ever knew,' said Lord St. Simon.

'Did she know anyone named Flora Millar?' 'No, I cannot say that she did.' 'A woman who was in the hall when the carriage drove away, and who was so violent that the police had to be sent for. Did she know her?' 'It is impossible that she could. The woman was a stranger to me.' 'Well, at least she knew her by sight,' said Lestrade.

Don't speak to anyone about my having gone.' And then I heard the maid say, 'All right, madam. You can depend upon my keeping mum.' Lord St. Simon flushed a little as he repeated the last words. 'It seemed to me that there was an unnecessary air of secrecy about it, and I confess that I was a little hurt that she should arrange matters in this way without consulting me. I said nothing, however, but came straight down to the breakfast-room. She was not there, so I waited for her. Presently I heard a footman enter the hall and heard him say, 'Mr. Lestrade, sir, and Mr. Sherlock Holmes.' I had no idea that anyone was coming, and I confess that I was considerably startled when they walked in. You have heard the rest of the story from them. They have no doubt told you about the note.' 'Yes, I have heard about the note. It seems to me to complicate matters exceedingly. Kindly tell us a little more about this American lady, Lord St. Simon. Besides this maid, Alice, are you aware that she had any female acquaintances in London?' 'She had fewer acquaintances of any sort than any woman I ever knew,' said Lord St. Simon. 'She was not universally popular, for she had very decided opinions of her own, and a rather quick temper. On the other hand, she was of a most warm-hearted and generous nature.' 'Did she know anyone named Flora Millar?' 'No, I cannot say that she did.' 'A woman who was in the hall when the carriage drove away, and who was so violent that the police had to be sent for. Did she know her?' 'It is impossible that she could. The woman was a stranger to me.' 'Well, at least she knew her by sight,' said Lestrade. 'For she was seen talking to her in the street on the day before the wedding.' 'What?' cried Lord St. Simon, starting from his chair. 'That is impossible! She could not have known that I knew the woman.' 'Excuse me, Lord St. Simon,' said Holmes, 'but I think you are mistaken. I have the best reasons for believing that she did know this woman, and that she had a very strong reason for wishing to avoid her.' 'And what was that reason?' 'That is just what I want to find out,' said Holmes. 'But I have no doubt that it is connected with the note which she left behind her.' 'But what could she have to do with this woman?' 'That is just what we have to discover. But I have no doubt that she was in communication with her, and that this woman was the cause of her disappearance.' 'I cannot believe it,' said Lord St. Simon. 'She was a woman of the highest character, and she had no secrets from me.' 'I am afraid that you are mistaken, Lord St. Simon,' said Holmes. 'I have the best reasons for believing that she had a secret, and that this woman was the confidante of it.' 'But what could the secret be?' 'That is just what we have to find out,' said Holmes. 'But I have no doubt that it is connected with the note which she left behind her.' 'But what could she have to do with this woman?' 'That is just what we have to discover.

            "prefix-probing": "“I saw her in conversation with her maid.” Holmes leaned back in his chair, his eyes half-closed, a thin curl of smoke rising from the cigarette he held between his long, sensitive fingers. “And what did you gather from that simple tableau, Watson?” he murmured, his voice a low drone that seemed to emanate from the depths of his contemplation. I shifted in my seat, feeling the familiar prickle of inadequacy under his gaze, even when it was not directly upon me. “Little enough, Holmes, I confess. It was merely a glimpse through the drawing-room window as we passed. The maid seemed agitated, wringing her hands, while the mistress – Mrs. Abernathy herself – stood stiffly, her face pale and set. There was an intensity about their exchange that struck me, but the words were inaudible.” Holmes opened his eyes, fixing them upon the ceiling. “Intensity, you say? Agitation on the part of the servant, rigidity on the part of the employer. A common enough dynamic, perhaps, in moments of domestic crisis. But in the context of the disappearance of the Abernathy diamonds, it takes on a rather more pointed significance, would you not agree?” “Certainly, Holmes. It suggests a shared secret, or perhaps a disagreement over something vital.” “Precisely. Or it suggests that the maid knows something that the mistress finds deeply troubling. Consider the positions. The mistress, the injured party, ostensibly distraught over the loss of her priceless jewels. The maid, a trusted member of the household staff, privy to the intimate goings-on within the house. If the maid were merely offering comfort, the mistress would likely be less composed, more openly distressed. If they were discussing the theft itself, one might expect a shared anxiety, a mutual brainstorming of possibilities. But you describe rigidity and pallor in the mistress, and agitation in the maid. This inversion of expected roles is, to say the least, suggestive.” He paused, taking a slow drag from his cigarette. “Tell me again about the maid, Watson. Your impressions.” “A young woman, perhaps five-and-twenty. Plainly dressed, as one would expect. Dark hair, pulled back severely. Her features were sharp, almost bird-like, and her eyes seemed unusually bright, even from a distance.” “Bright eyes,” Holmes repeated softly. “A sign of intelligence, perhaps, or of heightened emotion. Did you notice her hands?” “Yes, as I said, she was wringing them.” “Anything else? Any peculiarity?” I thought back, trying to conjure the fleeting image more clearly. “Her nails, perhaps. They seemed… short. Almost bitten.” Holmes sat up abruptly, his eyes gleaming with sudden interest. “Bitten nails! Excellent, Watson, excellent! A small detail, perhaps, but potentially a significant one. It speaks of nervousness, of anxiety, yes, but also perhaps of a habit born of long-standing stress or even guilt. A person wringing their hands is agitated in the moment. A person with bitten nails carries their anxiety with them, a constant companion.” He rose and began to pace the room, his hands clasped behind his back. “So, we have a mistress who is unnaturally composed in the face of ruin, and a maid who is visibly distressed, wringing her hands, and bears the marks of chronic anxiety. And you saw them in earnest conversation, a conversation that left the mistress pale and rigid. What does this suggest to you, Watson?” I considered the facts, trying to follow his line of reasoning. “That the maid knows something about the diamonds, something the mistress wishes she did not know?” “Getting warmer, Watson, warmer. But let us refine it further. If the maid stole the diamonds, why would the mistress be merely pale and rigid? One would expect fury, accusation, perhaps even a physical confrontation. If someone else stole them, and the maid merely has a theory, why the extreme agitation on her part, and the mistress’s frozen demeanour? No, Watson, I suspect the truth is more complex, and perhaps more tragic. I suspect that the maid knows who took the diamonds, and that the identity of the thief is someone the mistress is desperate to protect. And the conversation you witnessed was the maid, perhaps, wrestling with her conscience, or perhaps even attempting a form of blackmail, while the mistress was confronted with a terrible dilemma – the loss of her jewels versus the exposure of someone she holds dear. The bitten nails, the wringing hands, the sharp, bright eyes – they all point to a woman under immense pressure, caught between loyalty, fear, and perhaps a desperate need for money. The mistress’s pallor and rigidity suggest a dawning horror, a realization that the truth, if revealed, will shatter her world far more completely than the mere loss of property. Yes, Watson, that brief glimpse through the window has provided us with a most promising avenue of inquiry. The maid, my dear fellow, the maid holds the key to this entire perplexing affair.” He stopped pacing and turned to me, a look of keen anticipation on his face. “We must speak to this young woman at once.”"

I had formed my conclusions as to the case before our client came into the room.”\n“My dear Holmes!”\n“I have notes of several similar cases, though none, as I remarked before, which were quite as prompt. My whole examination served to turn my conjecture into a certainty. Circumstantial evidence is occasionally very convincing, as when you find a trout in the milk, to quote Thoreau’s example.”\n“But I have heard all that you have heard.”\n“Without, however, the knowledge of pre-existing cases which serves me so well. There was a parallel instance in Aberdeen some years back, and something on very much the same lines at Munich the year after the Franco-Prussian War. It is one of these cases—but, hullo, here is Lestrade! Good-afternoon, Lestrade! You will find an extra tumbler upon the sideboard, and there are cigars in the box.”\nThe official detective was attired in a pea-jacket and cravat, which gave him a decidedly nautical appearance, and he carried a black canvas bag in his hand. With a short greeting he seated himself and lit the cigar which had been offered to him.\n“What’s up, then?” asked Holmes with a twinkle in his eye. “You look dissatisfied.”\n“And I feel dissatisfied. It is this infernal St. Simon marriage case. I can make neither head nor tail of the business.”\n“Really! You surprise me.”\n“Who ever heard of such a mixed affair? Every clue seems to slip through my fingers. I have been at work upon it all day.”\n“And very wet it seems to have made you,” said Holmes laying his hand upon the arm of the pea-jacket.\n“Yes, I have been dragging the Serpentine.”\n“In Heaven’s name, what for?”\n“In search of the body of Lady St. Simon.”\nSherlock Holmes leaned back in his chair and laughed heartily.\n“Have you dragged the basin of Trafalgar Square fountain?” he asked.\n“Why? What do you mean?”\n“Because you have just as good a chance of finding this lady in the one as in the other.”\nLestrade shot an angry glance at my companion. “I suppose you know all about it,” he snarled.\n“Well, I have only just heard the facts, but my mind is made up.”\n“Oh, indeed! Then you think that the Serpentine plays no part in the matter?”\n“I think it very unlikely.”\n“Then perhaps you will kindly explain how it is that we found this in it?” He opened his bag as he spoke, and tumbled onto the floor a wedding-dress of watered silk, a pair of white satin shoes and a bride’s wreath and veil, all discoloured and soaked in water. “There,” said he, putting a new wedding-ring upon the top of the pile. “There is a little nut for you to crack, Master Holmes.”",

Her father the day after to-morrow returns to New York. The lady is with him, presumably. Case solved.” Lord St. Simon stared at Holmes with a countenance in which amazement and indignation were equally blended. “I am afraid that your humour is a little upon the elephantine side, my dear Mr. Holmes,” said he, rising. “The case is a perfectly serious one with me.” “My dear Lord St. Simon,” said Holmes, laughing, “what step is there which you could take which I have not already considered?” “What is that you propose, then?” “That you return to your father-in-law and assure him that all is well, and that I have solved the case.” “And that you will wire him when the lady is found?” “That I will wire him when the lady is found.—But I am convinced that she is already found.” “And where?” “That is a detail which I hope to supply in a very few minutes.” Lord St. Simon shrugged his shoulders and walked out of the room. “That’s a man who had better be supplied with a first-class custodian,” said Holmes, as he lit his pipe. “If I am mistaken he is a most unfortunate man, and a most long-suffering one, so far as I can see. I am not mistaken, however. No, I feel perfectly confident that I am acting in the best interests of all concerned, and that everyone will thank me in the end. In half an hour I shall call upon Mr. Aloysius Doran.” I was still lost in amazement, but I knew Holmes’s methods too well to shake his confidence. “You appeared to be taking it very easily,” said I. “I am convinced that it is an easy case,” he replied. “I have been searching for some time for a case at once simple and sensational, and here it is.” “You are sure that she is not dead?” “I should say at this moment that there has been no tragedy at all.” “You don’t think that she came to the Serpentine?” “No. I do not.” “What makes you so sure?” “I feel it in my bones.

His face was dark and troubled, and his clothes were all draggled and wet. “I can’t make head or tail of it, Mr. Holmes,” said he. “Look at my clothes, sir—they tell their own tale. I have been dragging the Serpentine for the last four hours, and what do you think I have found? Nothing, sir, nothing!” “Did you expect to find anything?” “Well, I did, Mr. Holmes. I really did. It seemed to me to be the most likely place. “You dragged the four hours,” said Holmes. “As I understand it, you might have dragged for four years with as much result. Have you tried the pond in Trafalgar Square?” “I’ve made every possible search, Mr. Holmes—except the right one,” he added, with a bitter smile. “Well, you can’t expect to get your man every time, Lestrade,” said Holmes, banteringly. “I thought I had him once. He was arrested and taken to the station, but a good alibi proved that he could have nothing to do with it. However, I expect that I shall be able to lay my hands upon him in the course of the day.

You had better change.” “I have had enough of wet clothes,” said Lestrade, gruffly. “I have had enough of this case, too.” “You have not had enough of the Serpentine, apparently,” said Holmes, laughing. “I have had quite enough of the Serpentine, Mr. Holmes. I have had enough of the whole business. I have been at it all day, and I am no nearer the end than when I started. I have had enough of the Serpentine, and I have had enough of you, too.” “You have had enough of me, Lestrade?” “Yes, Mr. Holmes, I have.

I congratulate you warmly.”\nLestrade rose in his triumph and bent his head to look. “Why,” he shrieked, “you’re looking at the wrong side!”\n“On the contrary, this is the right side.”\n“The right side? You’re mad! Here is the note written in pencil over here.”\n“And over here is what appears to be the fragment of a hotel bill, which interests me deeply.”\n“There’s nothing in it. I looked at it before,” said Lestrade. “‘Oct. 4th, rooms 8s., breakfast 2s. 6d., cocktail 1s., lunch 2s. 6d., glass sherry, 8d.’ I see nothing in that.”\n“Very likely not. It is most important, all the same. As to the note, it is important also, or at least the initials are, so I congratulate you again.”\n“I’ve wasted time enough,” said Lestrade, rising. “I believe in hard work and not in sitting by the fire spinning fine theories. Good-day, Mr. Holmes, and we shall see which gets to the bottom of the matter first.” He gathered up the garments, thrust them into the bag, and made for the door.",

They were picked up by a river-man on the Chiswick side, a little above the bridge.”\n\n“And we may take it, then, that there was no body in the dress?”\n\n“None, sir, none.”\n\n“Then it is most extraordinary. Pray what explanation do you put upon it?”\n\nLestrade rubbed his hands. “An explanation which very well fits the facts. It was undoubtedly an attempt to commit suicide. The poor lady threw her clothes into the river, with some vague idea of making it appear that she had drowned herself. It is, of course, the merest affectation, for it is an obvious thing that a real suicide does not take her clothes off before she plunges in. Besides,” here Lestrade lowered his voice and looked round him, “we have further evidence that she had no intention of ending her days.”\n\n“Indeed? You surprise me.”\n\n“Yes, we have been able to trace her since then.”\n\n“But if she is in hiding, why should she do such extraordinary things as these?”\n\n“Well, that is only a blind,” said Lestrade.\n\n“Still, it seems rather an absurd blind—a theatrical piece of nonsense,” said Holmes, shrugging his shoulders.\n\n“Ah, it is easy to criticize,” said Lestrade, in a nettled voice. “Perhaps you would do a little better yourself. But I rather fancy that I am on the right track this time. You know what the papers say about Flora Millar, the daughter of the old poacher. You remember her?”\n\n“I can’t say that I do.”\n\n“She was a wild girl, and known to be on the worst of terms with her lady. She had, as you remember, some reason for hating her. Now, sir, I consider that Flora Millar is concerned in the disappearance of Lady St. Simon.”\n\n“I should be exceedingly glad to hear you say so,” said Holmes.\n\n“Why, bless you, sir, it is obvious on the face of it! Look at this!” He fumbled in the pocket of his coat, and produced a small card-case. “This was found in the pocket of the dress. Look at it.”\n\nA small note was folded up and placed in the case. Holmes drew it out and flattened it upon his knee. He then handed it to Watson and me. It was written in pencil upon half a sheet of grey paper, with a jagged edge, which seemed to have been torn from a notebook. It ran:\n\n“You will see me when all is ready. Come at once. F. H. M.”\n\n“It is Flora Millar’s undoubted writing,” said Lestrade, triumphantly. “I thought we should get to the bottom of it at last. This woman knew of Lady St. Simon’s elopement, and she helped her. Let her only prove that she was elsewhere at the time that the clothes were thrown into the river, and she is free. Otherwise, I apprehend that we shall have a very clear case against her.”\n\n“But this is excellent!” said Holmes. “Excellent! Pray let me have a look at the note again.”\n\nHe took the scrap of paper in his hand and held it up to the light. “It is, as you say, exceedingly important,” said he, “and I congratulate you heartily upon your success.”\n\n“The paper was found in the dress, you say?”\n\n“Precisely.”\n\n“It is a note from Flora Millar, with her initials upon it. You will see me when all is ready. Come at once. F. H. M. Now my theory is—”\n\n“That she helped her to get away. Excellent!” said Holmes. “You are sure it is Flora Millar’s writing?”\n\n“I know it to be so.”\n\n“It is convincing,” said Holmes, looking at the note again. “There is one point which you have missed, however.”\n\n“Missed!” cried Lestrade, with a start. “What is that?”\n\n“The back of the note.”\n\n“The back!” echoed Lestrade, staring. “There is nothing on the back.”\n\n“Quite so. And what do you deduce from that?”\n\n“Nothing at all.”\n\n“Ah, you are not a trained observer,” said Holmes. “You see, there is a fragment of a hotel bill upon the back. Oct. 4th, rooms 8s., breakfast 2s. 6d., dinner 11s., wines 8s., sundries 3s. 6d. Total £1 13s. Od. I am deeply interested in that bill. It is most important.”\n\n“Good heavens, Mr. Holmes, what can it matter where the lady spent a few pounds? The note is what I go upon.”\n\n“Well, well, you are perfectly right, Mr. Lestrade. It is the note which is of importance. But the bill is also of importance. It is a pity that you have not had some training in the more exact sciences. A little chemistry, now, or a little knowledge of botany, might have been of use to you in this case. You see that the paper is torn from a notebook. It is a common paper, but it is a common paper with a difference. It is a paper which is used—”\n\n“Well, well, Mr. Holmes, you are very ingenious,” said Lestrade, laughing. “But I think that I can manage this matter without either chemistry or botany.

            "prefix-probing": "“Oh, indeed!” said my friend, blowing blue rings into the air. “And what, pray, do you deduce from that, Watson?” He leaned back in his chair, his eyes half-closed, a picture of languid contentment that belied the razor-sharp intellect perpetually at work beneath the surface. I had just finished recounting the curious incident of the missing umbrella and the subsequent discovery of a single muddy footprint on the doorstep of our neighbour, Mr. Henderson, a man known for his meticulous habits and aversion to anything remotely resembling disorder. It was a trifle, perhaps, but one that had piqued my interest, and I had presented it to Holmes with a certain air of triumph, hoping to elicit a spark of that extraordinary analytical power. “Well, Holmes,” I began, feeling slightly deflated by his seemingly indifferent response, “it seems clear that someone, presumably Mr. Henderson himself, went out in the rain without his umbrella, which is most unlike him. And the footprint suggests he returned shortly after, tracking mud into his otherwise spotless entrance.” Holmes chuckled softly, the rings of smoke dissolving into the morning light filtering through the bay window. “My dear Watson, you observe, but you do not deduce. You see the facts, but you fail to grasp their significance. Consider the footprint. You say it is muddy. Is it merely mud, or is there something more?” I peered at the mental image of the footprint I had examined. “It was dark mud, Holmes, rather sticky.” “Precisely. And where in this immediate vicinity would one find dark, sticky mud of that particular consistency?” He paused, allowing me time to consider. My mind raced over the local geography – the park, the street, the small patch of garden behind our own dwelling. “The patch by the old oak tree at the corner of the square,” I ventured. “It remains damp and muddy there long after the rest has dried.” “Excellent, Watson! A step in the right direction. Now, consider the umbrella. You say it is missing. Was it merely forgotten, or deliberately left behind?” “I assumed forgotten, given the sudden shower.” “An assumption based on probability, not evidence. Let us assume, for a moment, it was deliberate. Why would a man like Mr. Henderson, who abhors disorder and is known for his foresight, deliberately leave his umbrella behind on a day when rain was forecast?” I confessed myself at a loss. “Exactly. The simple explanation, while appealing in its directness, often obscures a more complex truth. The footprint, the missing umbrella, the uncharacteristic behaviour – they are not isolated incidents, but threads in a larger tapestry. The mud from the oak tree suggests a specific route taken. The missing umbrella, coupled with that route, suggests a purpose beyond merely stepping out for a breath of air. Perhaps he did not *forget* the umbrella, Watson. Perhaps he *could not* take it with him.” Holmes’s eyes were now fully open, gleaming with that familiar intensity. “The game, as they say, is afoot, though on a rather miniature scale this time. Nevertheless, even the smallest pebble can reveal the contours of the shore.” He rose from his chair, his languor instantly replaced by restless energy. “Come, Watson, let us pay a call on our fastidious neighbour. I have a sudden fancy to examine his umbrella stand.”"

          "text_segment": "“Just one hint to you, Lestrade,” drawled Holmes before his rival vanished; “I will tell you the true solution of the matter. Lady St. Simon is a myth. There is not, and there never has been, any such person.”\nLestrade looked sadly at my companion. Then he turned to me, tapped his forehead three times, shook his head solemnly, and hurried away.\nHe had hardly shut the door behind him when Holmes rose to put on his overcoat. “There is something in what the fellow says about outdoor work,” he remarked, “so I think, Watson, that I must leave you to your papers for a little.”\nIt was after five o’clock when Sherlock Holmes left me, but I had no time to be lonely, for within an hour there arrived a confectioner’s man with a very large flat box. This he unpacked with the help of a youth whom he had brought with him, and presently, to my very great astonishment, a quite epicurean little cold supper began to be laid out upon our humble lodging-house mahogany. There were a couple of brace of cold woodcock, a pheasant, a pâté de foie gras pie with a group of ancient and cobwebby bottles. Having laid out all these luxuries, my two visitors vanished away, like the genii of the Arabian Nights, with no explanation save that the things had been paid for and were ordered to this address.\nJust before nine o’clock Sherlock Holmes stepped briskly into the room. His features were gravely set, but there was a light in his eye which made me think that he had not been disappointed in his conclusions.\n“They have laid the supper, then,” he said, rubbing his hands.\n“You seem to expect company. They have laid for five.”\n“Yes, I fancy we may have some company dropping in,” said he. “I am surprised that Lord St. Simon has not already arrived. Ha! I fancy that I hear his step now upon the stairs.”\nIt was indeed our visitor of the afternoon who came bustling in, dangling his glasses more vigorously than ever, and with a very perturbed expression upon his aristocratic features.\n“My messenger reached you, then?” asked Holmes.\n“Yes, and I confess that the contents startled me beyond measure. Have you good authority for what you say?”\n“The best possible.”\nLord St. Simon sank into a chair and passed his hand over his forehead.\n“What will the Duke say,” he murmured, “when he hears that one of the family has been subjected to such humiliation?”\n“It is the purest accident. I cannot allow that there is any humiliation.”\n“Ah, you look on these things from another standpoint.”\n“I fail to see that anyone is to blame. I can hardly see how the lady could have acted otherwise, though her abrupt method of doing it was undoubtedly to be regretted. Having no mother, she had no one to advise her at such a crisis.”\n“It was a slight, sir, a public slight,” said Lord St. Simon, tapping his fingers upon the table.\n“You must make allowance for this poor girl, placed in so unprecedented a position.”\n“I will make no allowance. I am very angry indeed, and I have been shamefully used.”\n“I think that I heard a ring,” said Holmes. “Yes, there are steps on the landing. If I cannot persuade you to take a lenient view of the matter, Lord St. Simon, I have brought an advocate here who may be more successful.” He opened the door and ushered in a lady and gentleman. “Lord St. Simon,” said he “allow me to introduce you to Mr. and Mrs. Francis Hay Moulton. The lady, I think, you have already met.”\nAt the sight of these newcomers our client had sprung from his seat and stood very erect, with his eyes cast down and his hand thrust into the breast of his frock-coat, a picture of offended dignity. The lady had taken a quick step forward and had held out her hand to him, but he still refused to raise his eyes. It was as well for his resolution, perhaps, for her pleading face was one which it was hard to resist.\n“You’re angry, Robert,” said she. “Well, I guess you have every cause to be.”\n“Pray make no apology to me,” said Lord St. Simon bitterly.\n“Oh, yes, I know that I have treated you real bad and that I should have spoken to you before I went; but I was kind of rattled, and from the time when I saw Frank here again I just didn’t know what I was doing or saying. I only wonder I didn’t fall down and do a faint right there before the altar.”\n“Perhaps, Mrs. Moulton, you would like my friend and me to leave the room while you explain this matter?”\n“If I may give an opinion,” remarked the strange gentleman, “we’ve had just a little too much secrecy over this business already. For my part, I should like all Europe and America to hear the rights of it.” He was a small, wiry, sunburnt man, clean-shaven, with a sharp face and alert manner.\n“Then I’ll tell our story right away,” said the lady. “Frank here and I met in ’84, in McQuire’s camp, near the Rockies, where Pa was working a claim. We were engaged to each other, Frank and I; but then one day father struck a rich pocket and made a pile, while poor Frank here had a claim that petered out and came to nothing. The richer Pa grew the poorer was Frank; so at last Pa wouldn’t hear of our engagement lasting any longer, and he took me away to ’Frisco. Frank wouldn’t throw up his hand, though; so he followed me there, and he saw me without Pa knowing anything about it. It would only have made him mad to know, so we just fixed it all up for ourselves. Frank said that he would go and make his pile, too, and never come back to claim me until he had as much as Pa. So then I promised to wait for him to the end of time and pledged myself not to marry anyone else while he lived. ‘Why shouldn’t we be married right away, then,’ said he, ‘and then I will feel sure of you; and I won’t claim to be your husband until I come back?’ Well, we talked it over, and he had fixed it all up so nicely, with a clergyman all ready in waiting, that we just did it right there; and then Frank went off to seek his fortune, and I went back to Pa.\n“The next I heard of Frank was that he was in Montana, and then he went prospecting in Arizona, and then I heard of him from New Mexico. After that came a long newspaper story about how a miners’ camp had been attacked by Apache Indians, and there was my Frank’s name among the killed. I fainted dead away, and I was very sick for months after. Pa thought I had a decline and took me to half the doctors in ’Frisco. Not a word of news came for a year and more, so that I never doubted that Frank was really dead. Then Lord St. Simon came to ’Frisco, and we came to London, and a marriage was arranged, and Pa was very pleased, but I felt all the time that no man on this earth would ever take the place in my heart that had been given to my poor Frank.\n“Still, if I had married Lord St. Simon, of course I’d have done my duty by him. We can’t command our love, but we can our actions. I went to the altar with him with the intention to make him just as good a wife as it was in me to be. But you may imagine what I felt when, just as I came to the altar rails, I glanced back and saw Frank standing and looking at me out of the first pew. I thought it was his ghost at first; but when I looked again there he was still, with a kind of question in his eyes, as if to ask me whether I were glad or sorry to see him. I wonder I didn’t drop. I know that everything was turning round, and the words of the clergyman were just like the buzz of a bee in my ear. I didn’t know what to do. Should I stop the service and make a scene in the church? I glanced at him again, and he seemed to know what I was thinking, for he raised his finger to his lips to tell me to be still. Then I saw him scribble on a piece of paper, and I knew that he was writing me a note. As I passed his pew on the way out I dropped my bouquet over to him, and he slipped the note into my hand when he returned me the flowers. It was only a line asking me to join him when he made the sign to me to do so. Of course I never doubted for a moment that my first duty was now to him, and I determined to do just whatever he might direct.\n“When I got back I told my maid, who had known him in California, and had always been his friend. I ordered her to say nothing, but to get a few things packed and my ulster ready. I know I ought to have spoken to Lord St. Simon, but it was dreadful hard before his mother and all those great people. I just made up my mind to run away and explain afterwards. I hadn’t been at the table ten minutes before I saw Frank out of the window at the other side of the road. He beckoned to me and then began walking into the Park. I slipped out, put on my things, and followed him. Some woman came talking something or other about Lord St. Simon to me—seemed to me from the little I heard as if he had a little secret of his own before marriage also—but I managed to get away from her and soon overtook Frank. We got into a cab together, and away we drove to some lodgings he had taken in Gordon Square, and that was my true wedding after all those years of waiting. Frank had been a prisoner among the Apaches, had escaped, came on to ’Frisco, found that I had given him up for dead and had gone to England, followed me there, and had come upon me at last on the very morning of my second wedding.”\n“I saw it in a paper,” explained the American. “It gave the name and the church but not where the lady lived.”\n“Then we had a talk as to what we should do, and Frank was all for openness, but I was so ashamed of it all that I felt as if I should like to vanish away and never see any of them again—just sending a line to Pa, perhaps, to show him that I was alive. It was awful to me to think of all those lords and ladies sitting round that breakfast-table and waiting for me to come back. So Frank took my wedding-clothes and things and made a bundle of them, so that I should not be traced, and dropped them away somewhere where no one could find them. It is likely that we should have gone on to Paris to-morrow, only that this good gentleman, Mr. Holmes, came round to us this evening, though how he found us is more than I can think, and he showed us very clearly and kindly that I was wrong and that Frank was right, and that we should be putting ourselves in the wrong if we were so secret. Then he offered to give us a chance of talking to Lord St. Simon alone, and so we came right away round to his rooms at once. Now, Robert, you have heard it all, and I am very sorry if I have given you pain, and I hope that you do not think very meanly of me.”",

Lord St. Simon is a deeply wronged man, but he is neither a criminal nor has he ever intended to become one. On the contrary, we are dealing with an absolutely innocent person who is the victim of an exceedingly unfortunate series of misunderstandings.”\n\n“And the lady?”\n\n“Has been cruelly used, but not with deliberate intent.”\n\n“In what way?”\n\n“She has been subjected to a most unnatural strain upon her nerves.”\n\n“May I ask, Mr. Holmes, who has subjected her to it?”\n\n“Someone who had a prior claim upon her energies, her affections, and her person.”\n\nThe inspector looked puzzled. “You say that Lord St. Simon is innocent, and that the lady is innocent, and yet that there has been a crime.”\n\n“Precisely. I have never said that there has been a crime.”\n\n“The disappearance of the lady, then?”\n\n“An unfortunate accident, as I have ventured to call it. This gentleman, Mr. Lestrade, is perfectly correct in his deductions. I am afraid that they take us to an entirely different point from the one which he has reached. But if you will kindly leave the case in my hands, I promise that you shall hear a full account of the matter from my lips. I have no doubt that I can lay my hands upon the lady this very night.”\n\n“But where is she?”\n\n“That is just what I am about to find out.”\n\n“I shall be very glad to hear from you, Mr. Holmes. I hope that the lady is safe and well.”\n\n“I have no doubt of it. I have no doubt of it. And now, Mr. Lestrade, I must ask you to excuse me, for I have a little work to do.”\n\nThe inspector bowed and left us.

          "text_segment": "Lord St. Simon had by no means relaxed his rigid attitude, but had listened with a frowning brow and a compressed lip to this long narrative.\n“Excuse me,” he said, “but it is not my custom to discuss my most intimate personal affairs in this public manner.”\n“Then you won’t forgive me? You won’t shake hands before I go?”\n“Oh, certainly, if it would give you any pleasure.” He put out his hand and coldly grasped that which she extended to him.\n“I had hoped,” suggested Holmes, “that you would have joined us in a friendly supper.”\n“I think that there you ask a little too much,” responded his Lordship. “I may be forced to acquiesce in these recent developments, but I can hardly be expected to make merry over them. I think that with your permission I will now wish you all a very good-night.” He included us all in a sweeping bow and stalked out of the room.\n“Then I trust that you at least will honour me with your company,” said Sherlock Holmes. “It is always a joy to meet an American, Mr. Moulton, for I am one of those who believe that the folly of a monarch and the blundering of a minister in far-gone years will not prevent our children from being some day citizens of the same world-wide country under a flag which shall be a quartering of the Union Jack with the Stars and Stripes.”\n“The case has been an interesting one,” remarked Holmes when our visitors had left us, “because it serves to show very clearly how simple the explanation may be of an affair which at first sight seems to be almost inexplicable. Nothing could be more natural than the sequence of events as narrated by this lady, and nothing stranger than the result when viewed, for instance, by Mr. Lestrade of Scotland Yard.”\n“You were not yourself at fault at all, then?”\n“From the first, two facts were very obvious to me, the one that the lady had been quite willing to undergo the wedding ceremony, the other that she had repented of it within a few minutes of returning home. Obviously something had occurred during the morning, then, to cause her to change her mind. What could that something be? She could not have spoken to anyone when she was out, for she had been in the company of the bridegroom. Had she seen someone, then? If she had, it must be someone from America because she had spent so short a time in this country that she could hardly have allowed anyone to acquire so deep an influence over her that the mere sight of him would induce her to change her plans so completely. You see we have already arrived, by a process of exclusion, at the idea that she might have seen an American. Then who could this American be, and why should he possess so much influence over her? It might be a lover; it might be a husband. Her young womanhood had, I knew, been spent in rough scenes and under strange conditions. So far I had got before I ever heard Lord St. Simon’s narrative. When he told us of a man in a pew, of the change in the bride’s manner, of so transparent a device for obtaining a note as the dropping of a bouquet, of her resort to her confidential maid, and of her very significant allusion to claim-jumping—which in miners’ parlance means taking possession of that which another person has a prior claim to—the whole situation became absolutely clear. She had gone off with a man, and the man was either a lover or was a previous husband—the chances being in favour of the latter.”\n“And how in the world did you find them?”\n“It might have been difficult, but friend Lestrade held information in his hands the value of which he did not himself know. The initials were, of course, of the highest importance, but more valuable still was it to know that within a week he had settled his bill at one of the most select London hotels.”\n“How did you deduce the select?”\n“By the select prices. Eight shillings for a bed and eightpence for a glass of sherry pointed to one of the most expensive hotels. There are not many in London which charge at that rate. In the second one which I visited in Northumberland Avenue, I learned by an inspection of the book that Francis H. Moulton, an American gentleman, had left only the day before, and on looking over the entries against him, I came upon the very items which I had seen in the duplicate bill. His letters were to be forwarded to 226 Gordon Square; so thither I travelled, and being fortunate enough to find the loving couple at home, I ventured to give them some paternal advice and to point out to them that it would be better in every way that they should make their position a little clearer both to the general public and to Lord St. Simon in particular. I invited them to meet him here, and, as you see, I made him keep the appointment.”\n“But with no very good result,” I remarked. “His conduct was certainly not very gracious.”\n“Ah, Watson,” said Holmes, smiling, “perhaps you would not be very gracious either, if, after all the trouble of wooing and wedding, you found yourself deprived in an instant of wife and of fortune.

            "prefix-probing": "Lord St. Simon had by no means relaxed his rigid attitude, but had listened with a frowning brow and a compressed lip to this long narrative. “And your explanation, madam, is that you were a married woman, and knew it, at the moment that you attempted to marry me?” he asked at last, in a cold, hard voice. “I did not attempt to marry you. I did no more than follow the wishes of my father and of my friends. I knew that it was not right, that it was not just. Yet I had come to love you, and I hoped that perhaps my old life was gone for ever. It is hard for a woman to break away entirely from her past. But I should not have done it, and God knows that I have suffered for it.” “The lady’s explanation is both full and clear,” said Holmes, rising and bowing to the American lady. “It only remains for us to know what the gentleman did and why he did it. Come, Mr. Moulton, we should be glad to hear your account of the matter.” The man who had been leaning against the wall came forward, and took his stand beside his wife. He was a tall, handsome, sunburnt fellow, clean-shaven, save for a long, drooping moustache. He wore an old and frayed tweed suit, and his boots were cracked, but he had a careless, free and easy air which in no way resembled that of a professional ruffian. “I can explain it all, gentlemen,” said he. “If I am to blame in the matter, it is only because I over-calculated my own strength, and thought that I could hold out against my fate. I am a Californian miner, a lucky one. I have been working for some years past in the Stanislau diggings, and I made a pile by striking a pocket. I was coming home to marry my second sweetheart—I may say that, since the first is here—but as I came down from the mountains I was jumped by four rascals and robbed of all that I had. They tied me to a tree, and were cutting my throat, when my cousin, who had me in tow, shot two of them, and the others bolted. I was cut to pieces, but he saved my life. He took me to his cabin, and nursed me for a month. It was a long time before I was able to get about again. When I did, I found that my cousin had gone, and I was left without a cent in the world. I had to work my passage back to San Francisco, and then to get a fresh start. It was a hard struggle, and it was two years before I was able to get together the money for my passage to England. I had written to my wife, but had got no answer, and I was afraid that she was dead. I came to England, and I found that she was alive, and that she was going to be married. I saw the announcement in the paper, and I went to the church. I saw her come out, and I saw her face. I knew that she was my wife, and I went to her. I told her who I was, and I told her that I had come for her. She came with me, and we went away together. We have been together ever since. I have been trying to get a fresh start, but it is hard to do in a strange country. I have been working as a labourer, but I have not been able to get enough to keep us both. I have been trying to get back to California, but I have not been able to get the money. I have been hoping that something would turn up, but it has not. I am sorry if I have caused any trouble, but I could not help it. I could not leave my wife to marry another man.” “The case is clear,” said Holmes. “Mr. Moulton, I presume, you have your marriage certificate and other documents?” “I have everything here,” said the man, producing a packet from his breast pocket. Holmes glanced at them. “These appear to be in order,” said he. “Well, Lord St. Simon, I think that this concludes our investigation.” Lord St. Simon had listened to this fresh statement with the same rigid attention as before. His face was pale, and his eyes were fixed upon the ground. When Holmes finished, he raised his head, and looked at the American couple. “I have nothing to say,” said he. “You are free to go. I wish you well.” He turned away, and walked to the window, where he stood with his back to them. Holmes motioned to the others to withdraw. “I think that we may leave them to settle their own affairs,” said he. “Mr. Lestrade, I think that you may consider the case closed.” “Quite so, Mr. Holmes,” said Lestrade, with a shrug. “It is not a police matter, after all. It is a private affair.” He gathered up his papers, and prepared to depart. Watson and I followed him out of the room. As we passed through the hall, we saw Lord St. Simon still standing at the window, a solitary and dejected figure. We left the house, and walked together down the street. “Well, Watson,” said Holmes, “what do you think of it all?” “It is a strange story,” I answered. “A very strange story. And a sad one for Lord St. Simon.” “It is sad, no doubt,” said Holmes. “But it is also a lesson. It shows us how little we know of the lives of those around us. And it shows us that even in the most conventional of lives, there may be hidden depths and unexpected turns.” We walked on in silence for"

It seems rather sad that his relatives should allow him to come out alone.”\nMy friend rose lazily from his armchair and stood with his hands in the pockets of his dressing-gown, looking over my shoulder. It was a bright, crisp February morning, and the snow of the day before still lay deep upon the ground, shimmering brightly in the wintry sun. Down the centre of Baker Street it had been ploughed into a brown crumbly band by the traffic, but at either side and on the heaped-up edges of the footpaths it still lay as white as when it fell. The grey pavement had been cleaned and scraped, but was still dangerously slippery, so that there were fewer passengers than usual. Indeed, from the direction of the Metropolitan Station no one was coming save the single gentleman whose eccentric conduct had drawn my attention.\nHe was a man of about fifty, tall, portly, and imposing, with a massive, strongly marked face and a commanding figure. He was dressed in a sombre yet rich style, in black frock-coat, shining hat, neat brown gaiters, and well-cut pearl-grey trousers. Yet his actions were in absurd contrast to the dignity of his dress and features, for he was running hard, with occasional little springs, such as a weary man gives who is little accustomed to set any tax upon his legs. As he ran he jerked his hands up and down, waggled his head, and writhed his face into the most extraordinary contortions.\n“What on earth can be the matter with him?” I asked. “He is looking up at the numbers of the houses.”\n“I believe that he is coming here,” said Holmes, rubbing his hands.\n“Here?”\n“Yes; I rather think he is coming to consult me professionally. I think that I recognise the symptoms. Ha! did I not tell you?” As he spoke, the man, puffing and blowing, rushed at our door and pulled at our bell until the whole house resounded with the clanging.\nA few moments later he was in our room, still puffing, still gesticulating, but with so fixed a look of grief and despair in his eyes that our smiles were turned in an instant to horror and pity. For a while he could not get his words out, but swayed his body and plucked at his hair like one who has been driven to the extreme limits of his reason. Then, suddenly springing to his feet, he beat his head against the wall with such force that we both rushed upon him and tore him away to the centre of the room. Sherlock Holmes pushed him down into the easy-chair and, sitting beside him, patted his hand and chatted with him in the easy, soothing tones which he knew so well how to employ.",

He is a remarkably fine-looking man, too, if it were not for the wild eyes and the way in which he throws his arms about. Really, with his violent convulsions, he reminds me of a Burmese dancer.”\n\nI had been standing for some minutes looking at the vast sea of humanity which surges up against the windows of our cheery room in Baker Street when Holmes joined me. He had been engaged in some scientific work of his own, and his face was smeared with some vile-smelling chemical. He peered over my shoulder at the spectacle which had attracted my attention.\n\n“Some great trouble,” said he. “Yet, I fancy, a purely physical one.”\n\n“Why so?”\n\n“Look at the man’s gait. He is coming along this side of the street, and his movements are erratic, grotesque, but not those of a madman. That he is in a state of intense mental agitation, however, is clear. Why, Watson, look at his face! Could you convulse your face like that?”\n\nI could not, for I am a man of iron nerve, but the fellow was certainly making the most extraordinary grimaces. He was a middle-sized, dark-haired man, and his flushed, distended face was convulsed with an agony which was dreadful to look upon. He was dressed in the very best fashion, however, and his clean-cut, firm chin and clear, brown eyes would speak of a strong nature, were it not for the wild, frantic look which overspread everything. He was wringing his hands, and every now and then he would give a convulsive sob. As he came nearer he quickened his pace, and finally broke into a run. Just as he reached our door he stopped, gave a deep groan, and threw up his hands at the sky. As he did so a paper fell from his hand and was blown by the wind to the other side of the road. It was a bitter morning, the sleet was beating down, and the wind seemed to blow through one’s very bones. Still, however, the man did not seem to feel the cold, but stood as if he were in a dream, with his eyes fixed upon the iron railings. Then, with a start, he seemed to remember himself, and darted across the road to recover the paper. As he stooped, however, I could see that a small, dark object had fallen from his breast into the snow. He did not seem to notice it, and after picking up his paper he hurried on towards our door. He was, I take it, a man of fifty, tall, portly, and imposing, with a massive head, and a countenance which would be handsome were it not for the expression of grief and agony which overspread it. He was dressed in a long, black frock-coat, and a high hat, and he carried a large, black bag in his hand. As he came up the steps I could see that his face was as white as a sheet, and his lips were quivering. He rang the bell, and then, as if he could not wait, he rang it again and again with frantic violence. Then he began to beat upon the door with his fists. I could hear Mrs. Hudson running up the stairs, and I knew that she would be in a state of alarm. I was about to go down myself when the door was opened, and the man rushed in. He was a perfect stranger to me, but I could see at a glance that he was a gentleman. His face was ghastly white, and his eyes were starting from his head. He was panting for breath, and his whole body was trembling. He looked wildly around him, and then, seeing Holmes, he staggered towards him. “Mr. Holmes,” he cried, “I am ruined! Ruined!” He fell into a chair, and covered his face with his hands. His whole body was convulsed with sobs, and he rocked himself to and fro like a man in agony. Holmes stood over him, and laid his hand upon his shoulder. “My dear sir,” said he, “pray compose yourself. I am sure that we shall be able to set matters right.”\n\nThe man took his hands from his face, and looked up at Holmes. His eyes were wild and staring, and his face was a ghastly sight. “It is impossible,” he cried. “Impossible! I am ruined! Ruined!” He sprang from his chair, and began to pace up and down the room. He wrung his hands, and tore his hair. He was like a man distraught. Holmes watched him with a calm, impassive face. “Pray, sir,” said he, “let me beg you to be calm. You are in a state of great agitation, and you will do yourself harm if you do not compose yourself. Pray sit down, and tell me what is the matter.”\n\nThe man stopped in his pacing, and looked at Holmes. His eyes were still wild, but there was a gleam of hope in them. “You think that you can help me?” he cried. “You think that you can help me?”\n\n“I am sure that I can,” said Holmes. “Pray sit down, and tell me all about it.”\n\nThe man looked at Holmes for a moment longer, and then, as if he had made up his mind, he sat down in the chair which Holmes",

He wrung his hands, and tore his hair. He was like a man distraught. Holmes watched him with a calm, impassive face. “Pray, sir,” said he, “let me beg you to be calm. You are in a state of great agitation, and you will do yourself harm if you do not compose yourself. Pray sit down, and tell me what is the matter.”\n\nThe man stopped in his pacing, and looked at Holmes. His eyes were still wild, but there was a gleam of hope in them. “You think that you can help me?” he cried. “You think that you can help me?”\n\n“I am sure that I can,” said Holmes. “Pray sit down, and tell me all about it.”\n\nThe man looked at Holmes for a moment longer, and then, as if he had made up his mind, he sat down in the chair which Holmes",

Pray wait until you have recovered yourself, and then I shall be most happy to look into any little problem which you may submit to me.”\nThe man sat for a minute or more with a heaving chest, fighting against his emotion. Then he passed his handkerchief over his brow, set his lips tight, and turned his face towards us.\n“No doubt you think me mad?” said he.\n“I see that you have had some great trouble,” responded Holmes.\n“God knows I have!—a trouble which is enough to unseat my reason, so sudden and so terrible is it. Public disgrace I might have faced, although I am a man whose character has never yet borne a stain. Private affliction also is the lot of every man; but the two coming together, and in so frightful a form, have been enough to shake my very soul. Besides, it is not I alone. The very noblest in the land may suffer unless some way be found out of this horrible affair.”\n“Pray compose yourself, sir,” said Holmes, “and let me have a clear account of who you are and what it is that has befallen you.”\n“My name,” answered our visitor, “is probably familiar to your ears. I am Alexander Holder, of the banking firm of Holder & Stevenson, of Threadneedle Street.”\nThe name was indeed well known to us as belonging to the senior partner in the second largest private banking concern in the City of London. What could have happened, then, to bring one of the foremost citizens of London to this most pitiable pass? We waited, all curiosity, until with another effort he braced himself to tell his story.\n“I feel that time is of value,” said he; “that is why I hastened here when the police inspector suggested that I should secure your co-operation. I came to Baker Street by the Underground and hurried from there on foot, for the cabs go slowly through this snow. That is why I was so out of breath, for I am a man who takes very little exercise. I feel better now, and I will put the facts before you as shortly and yet as clearly as I can.\n“It is, of course, well known to you that in a successful banking business as much depends upon our being able to find remunerative investments for our funds as upon our increasing our connection and the number of our depositors. One of our most lucrative means of laying out money is in the shape of loans, where the security is unimpeachable. We have done a good deal in this direction during the last few years, and there are many noble families to whom we have advanced large sums upon the security of their pictures, libraries, or plate.\n“Yesterday morning I was seated in my office at the bank when a card was brought in to me by one of the clerks. I started when I saw the name, for it was that of none other than—well, perhaps even to you I had better say no more than that it was a name which is a household word all over the earth—one of the highest, noblest, most exalted names in England. I was overwhelmed by the honour and attempted, when he entered, to say so, but he plunged at once into business with the air of a man who wishes to hurry quickly through a disagreeable task.\n“‘Mr. Holder,’ said he, ‘I have been informed that you are in the habit of advancing money.’\n“‘The firm does so when the security is good.’ I answered.\n“‘It is absolutely essential to me,’ said he, ‘that I should have £ 50,000 at once. I could, of course, borrow so trifling a sum ten times over from my friends, but I much prefer to make it a matter of business and to carry out that business myself. In my position you can readily understand that it is unwise to place one’s self under obligations.’\n“‘For how long, may I ask, do you want this sum?’ I asked.\n“‘Next Monday I have a large sum due to me, and I shall then most certainly repay what you advance, with whatever interest you think it right to charge. But it is very essential to me that the money should be paid at once.’\n“‘I should be happy to advance it without further parley from my own private purse,’ said I, ‘were it not that the strain would be rather more than it could bear. If, on the other hand, I am to do it in the name of the firm, then in justice to my partner I must insist that, even in your case, every businesslike precaution should be taken.’\n“‘I should much prefer to have it so,’ said he, raising up a square, black morocco case which he had laid beside his chair. ‘You have doubtless heard of the Beryl Coronet?’\n“‘One of the most precious public possessions of the empire,’ said I.\n“‘Precisely.’ He opened the case, and there, imbedded in soft, flesh-coloured velvet, lay the magnificent piece of jewellery which he had named. ‘There are thirty-nine enormous beryls,’ said he, ‘and the price of the gold chasing is incalculable. The lowest estimate would put the worth of the coronet at double the sum which I have asked. I am prepared to leave it with you as my security.’\n“I took the precious case into my hands and looked in some perplexity from it to my illustrious client.\n“‘You doubt its value?’ he asked.\n“‘Not at all. I only doubt—’\n“‘The propriety of my leaving it. You may set your mind at rest about that. I should not dream of doing so were it not absolutely certain that I should be able in four days to reclaim it. It is a pure matter of form. Is the security sufficient?’\n“‘Ample.’\n“‘You understand, Mr. Holder, that I am giving you a strong proof of the confidence which I have in you, founded upon all that I have heard of you. I rely upon you not only to be discreet and to refrain from all gossip upon the matter but, above all, to preserve this coronet with every possible precaution because I need not say that a great public scandal would be caused if any harm were to befall it. Any injury to it would be almost as serious as its complete loss, for there are no beryls in the world to match these, and it would be impossible to replace them. I leave it with you, however, with every confidence, and I shall call for it in person on Monday morning.’\n“Seeing that my client was anxious to leave, I said no more but, calling for my cashier, I ordered him to pay over fifty £ 1000 notes. When I was alone once more, however, with the precious case lying upon the table in front of me, I could not but think with some misgivings of the immense responsibility which it entailed upon me. There could be no doubt that, as it was a national possession, a horrible scandal would ensue if any misfortune should occur to it. I already regretted having ever consented to take charge of it. However, it was too late to alter the matter now, so I locked it up in my private safe and turned once more to my work.\n“When evening came I felt that it would be an imprudence to leave so precious a thing in the office behind me. Bankers’ safes had been forced before now, and why should not mine be? If so, how terrible would be the position in which I should find myself! I determined, therefore, that for the next few days I would always carry the case backward and forward with me, so that it might never be really out of my reach. With this intention, I called a cab and drove out to my house at Streatham, carrying the jewel with me. I did not breathe freely until I had taken it upstairs and locked it in the bureau of my dressing-room.\n“And now a word as to my household, Mr. Holmes, for I wish you to thoroughly understand the situation. My groom and my page sleep out of the house, and may be set aside altogether. I have three maid-servants who have been with me a number of years and whose absolute reliability is quite above suspicion. Another, Lucy Parr, the second waiting-maid, has only been in my service a few months. She came with an excellent character, however, and has always given me satisfaction. She is a very pretty girl and has attracted admirers who have occasionally hung about the place. That is the only drawback which we have found to her, but we believe her to be a thoroughly good girl in every way.\n“So much for the servants. My family itself is so small that it will not take me long to describe it. I am a widower and have an only son, Arthur. He has been a disappointment to me, Mr. Holmes—a grievous disappointment. I have no doubt that I am myself to blame. People tell me that I have spoiled him. Very likely I have. When my dear wife died I felt that he was all I had to love. I could not bear to see the smile fade even for a moment from his face. I have never denied him a wish. Perhaps it would have been better for both of us had I been sterner, but I meant it for the best.\n“It was naturally my intention that he should succeed me in my business, but he was not of a business turn. He was wild, wayward, and, to speak the truth, I could not trust him in the handling of large sums of money. When he was young he became a member of an aristocratic club, and there, having charming manners, he was soon the intimate of a number of men with long purses and expensive habits. He learned to play heavily at cards and to squander money on the turf, until he had again and again to come to me and implore me to give him an advance upon his allowance, that he might settle his debts of honour. He tried more than once to break away from the dangerous company which he was keeping, but each time the influence of his friend, Sir George Burnwell, was enough to draw him back again.\n“And, indeed, I could not wonder that such a man as Sir George Burnwell should gain an influence over him, for he has frequently brought him to my house, and I have found myself that I could hardly resist the fascination of his manner. He is older than Arthur, a man of the world to his finger-tips, one who had been everywhere, seen everything, a brilliant talker, and a man of great personal beauty. Yet when I think of him in cold blood, far away from the glamour of his presence, I am convinced from his cynical speech and the look which I have caught in his eyes that he is one who should be deeply distrusted. So I think, and so, too, thinks my little Mary, who has a woman’s quick insight into character.\n“And now there is only she to be described. She is my niece; but when my brother died five years ago and left her alone in the world I adopted her, and have looked upon her ever since as my daughter. She is a sunbeam in my house—sweet, loving, beautiful, a wonderful manager and housekeeper, yet as tender and quiet and gentle as a woman could be. She is my right hand. I do not know what I could do without her. In only one matter has she ever gone against my wishes. Twice my boy has asked her to marry him, for he loves her devotedly, but each time she has refused him.",

My lips are as dry as – as dry as I don’t know what.” I poured him out a glass, and he drank it down. “At least you shall not lack a listener,” said my friend. “Tell me what this dreadful business is, and I promise you that I will spare no pains upon it.” The man sat up in his chair and looked wildly about him. “You will think that I am mad,” said he. “No, I am not mad, although I have gone through enough to drive me so. The thing is so absolutely fresh to me, and so utterly incredible, that I can hardly realise it yet. For forty years of my life I have been a partner in the great banking house of Holder & Stevenson, of Threadneedle Street. The name of the firm is a household word. I am the senior partner. I have always had the reputation of being a man of absolute integrity and of rather ascetic habits. So much so that the thirty years of loan business which have been conducted by the firm have been principally committed to my care. It’s my boast that, in all that time, not one shilling of principal or interest has been lost by the firm. I hope to God I may still say the same after this blessed day. “It was yesterday morning about half-past ten that the trouble began. I have an account of my own at the bank, and was cashing a cheque at the moment, when the cashier came down to my room and informed me that a gentleman wished to see me upon a matter of the utmost importance. He had refused to give his name, but he was a man of great power and of the highest position. Well, I went down to see him. He was a tall, dark, official-looking man, with a most austere face and a manner of great dignity. He was, I believe, exceedingly well known in political circles. I will not mention his name, for it is not necessary in connection with your inquiry, and it could only serve to embarrass him. I begged him to take a seat, and he stated that he had come upon a matter of delicate nature which he desired to keep out of the papers, and which involved the sum of fifty thousand pounds. He had occasion for that amount that very day. He had not the money in his bankers’, and it was absolutely essential that he should have it that night. “As you know, we are not moneylenders, but we are bankers, and have an immense deposit business. If any great nobleman or man of wealth desires a loan, he can always have it from us upon an adequate security. The Duke of Holdernesse, for example, has at present fifty thousand in the bank upon the security of his coronet. The Prince of Wales has thirty thousand upon his mortgages. The man’s name and the sum that he wanted were alike new to me, and I told him so, and that our transactions were usually of a much larger description. He smiled at this, and said that he had no doubt that, if he had had time, he could have made arrangements elsewhere, but that it was absolutely essential that he should get the money that day, and that he had been recommended to come to us. He then added that he had brought a security with him, and he produced a small chamois-leather bag. He handed it to me, and I opened it. “Inside there was a most beautiful coronet. It was a magnificent piece of work, and it was studded with thirty-nine enormous beryls, which blazed and sparkled with a quite extraordinary radiance. I have never seen so fine a collection. I knew that they must be of immense value. The gentleman explained that he was a collector of rare stones, and that he had been fortunate enough to secure this coronet from the Russian Imperial family. He had brought it with him to England, and he desired to raise fifty thousand pounds upon it for four days. At the end of that time he would redeem it for fifty-five thousand – five thousand pounds being the interest for the loan. He added that the coronet was of such national importance that he would not have parted with it for a day save that he had the most urgent need for the money. He begged me to be very careful of it, and to keep it in my own safe, and not to let anyone know that I had it. I assured him that it would be perfectly safe in our hands, and that we would take every precaution. He then signed the necessary papers, and I handed him the fifty thousand pounds in notes. “I felt a great weight upon my mind when he was gone. I knew that I had a great responsibility upon me, and I was anxious to get the coronet into a place of safety. I did not like to leave it in the bank safe, for it was a very large sum, and I was afraid that some accident might happen. I therefore determined to take it home with me and to keep it in my own safe. I live at Streatham, and I took the Underground to get there. It was snowing hard, and I had to walk from the station. I was very anxious, and I hurried on as fast as I could. I got home about half-past six, and I went straight to my dressing-room. I have a large bureau there, and I opened it and put the coronet inside. I locked it up and put the key in my pocket. “I have a large household, but I have very few servants.

Lucy Parr, who had brought in the coffee, had, I am sure, left the room; but I cannot swear that the door was closed. Mary and Arthur were much interested and wished to see the famous coronet, but I thought it better not to disturb it.\n“‘Where have you put it?’ asked Arthur.\n“‘In my own bureau.’\n“‘Well, I hope to goodness the house won’t be burgled during the night.’ said he.\n“‘It is locked up,’ I answered.\n“‘Oh, any old key will fit that bureau. When I was a youngster I have opened it myself with the key of the box-room cupboard.’\n“He often had a wild way of talking, so that I thought little of what he said. He followed me to my room, however, that night with a very grave face.\n“‘Look here, dad,’ said he with his eyes cast down, ‘can you let me have £ 200?’\n“‘No, I cannot!’ I answered sharply. ‘I have been far too generous with you in money matters.’\n“‘You have been very kind,’ said he, ‘but I must have this money, or else I can never show my face inside the club again.’\n“‘And a very good thing, too!’ I cried.\n“‘Yes, but you would not have me leave it a dishonoured man,’ said he. ‘I could not bear the disgrace. I must raise the money in some way, and if you will not let me have it, then I must try other means.’\n“I was very angry, for this was the third demand during the month. ‘You shall not have a farthing from me,’ I cried, on which he bowed and left the room without another word.\n“When he was gone I unlocked my bureau, made sure that my treasure was safe, and locked it again. Then I started to go round the house to see that all was secure—a duty which I usually leave to Mary but which I thought it well to perform myself that night. As I came down the stairs I saw Mary herself at the side window of the hall, which she closed and fastened as I approached.\n“‘Tell me, dad,’ said she, looking, I thought, a little disturbed, ‘did you give Lucy, the maid, leave to go out to-night?’\n“‘Certainly not.’\n“‘She came in just now by the back door. I have no doubt that she has only been to the side gate to see someone, but I think that it is hardly safe and should be stopped.’\n“‘You must speak to her in the morning, or I will if you prefer it. Are you sure that everything is fastened?’\n“‘Quite sure, dad.’\n“‘Then, good-night.’ I kissed her and went up to my bedroom again, where I was soon asleep.\n“I am endeavouring to tell you everything, Mr. Holmes, which may have any bearing upon the case, but I beg that you will question me upon any point which I do not make clear.”\n“On the contrary, your statement is singularly lucid.”\n“I come to a part of my story now in which I should wish to be particularly so. I am not a very heavy sleeper, and the anxiety in my mind tended, no doubt, to make me even less so than usual. About two in the morning, then, I was awakened by some sound in the house. It had ceased ere I was wide awake, but it had left an impression behind it as though a window had gently closed somewhere. I lay listening with all my ears. Suddenly, to my horror, there was a distinct sound of footsteps moving softly in the next room. I slipped out of bed, all palpitating with fear, and peeped round the corner of my dressing-room door.\n“‘Arthur!’ I screamed, ‘you villain! you thief! How dare you touch that coronet?’\n“The gas was half up, as I had left it, and my unhappy boy, dressed only in his shirt and trousers, was standing beside the light, holding the coronet in his hands. He appeared to be wrenching at it, or bending it with all his strength. At my cry he dropped it from his grasp and turned as pale as death. I snatched it up and examined it. One of the gold corners, with three of the beryls in it, was missing.\n“‘You blackguard!’ I shouted, beside myself with rage. ‘You have destroyed it! You have dishonoured me forever! Where are the jewels which you have stolen?’\n“‘Stolen!’ he cried.\n“‘Yes, thief!’ I roared, shaking him by the shoulder.\n“‘There are none missing. There cannot be any missing,’ said he.\n“‘There are three missing. And you know where they are. Must I call you a liar as well as a thief? Did I not see you trying to tear off another piece?’\n“‘You have called me names enough,’ said he, ‘I will not stand it any longer. I shall not say another word about this business, since you have chosen to insult me. I will leave your house in the morning and make my own way in the world.’\n“‘You shall leave it in the hands of the police!’ I cried half-mad with grief and rage. ‘I shall have this matter probed to the bottom.’\n“‘You shall learn nothing from me,’ said he with a passion such as I should not have thought was in his nature. ‘If you choose to call the police, let the police find what they can.’\n“By this time the whole house was astir, for I had raised my voice in my anger. Mary was the first to rush into my room, and, at the sight of the coronet and of Arthur’s face, she read the whole story and, with a scream, fell down senseless on the ground. I sent the housemaid for the police and put the investigation into their hands at once. When the inspector and a constable entered the house, Arthur, who had stood sullenly with his arms folded, asked me whether it was my intention to charge him with theft. I answered that it had ceased to be a private matter, but had become a public one, since the ruined coronet was national property. I was determined that the law should have its way in everything.\n“‘At least,’ said he, ‘you will not have me arrested at once. It would be to your advantage as well as mine if I might leave the house for five minutes.’\n“‘That you may get away, or perhaps that you may conceal what you have stolen,’ said I. And then, realising the dreadful position in which I was placed, I implored him to remember that not only my honour but that of one who was far greater than I was at stake; and that he threatened to raise a scandal which would convulse the nation. He might avert it all if he would but tell me what he had done with the three missing stones.\n“‘You may as well face the matter,’ said I; ‘you have been caught in the act, and no confession could make your guilt more heinous. If you but make such reparation as is in your power, by telling us where the beryls are, all shall be forgiven and forgotten.’\n“‘Keep your forgiveness for those who ask for it,’ he answered, turning away from me with a sneer. I saw that he was too hardened for any words of mine to influence him. There was but one way for it. I called in the inspector and gave him into custody. A search was made at once not only of his person but of his room and of every portion of the house where he could possibly have concealed the gems; but no trace of them could be found, nor would the wretched boy open his mouth for all our persuasions and our threats. This morning he was removed to a cell, and I, after going through all the police formalities, have hurried round to you to implore you to use your skill in unravelling the matter. The police have openly confessed that they can at present make nothing of it. You may go to any expense which you think necessary. I have already offered a reward of £ 1000. My God, what shall I do! I have lost my honour, my gems, and my son in one night. Oh, what shall I do!”",

I told them after dinner that I had a very valuable treasure in my keeping, and that I was so nervous about it that I could hardly sleep. I did not tell them what it was, but I showed them the bureau in which I had locked it, and I said that I should be easy if I thought that everyone in the house was as careful as I was. Arthur was lounging against the mantelpiece at the time, and he had some slight dispute with Mary. I had told them that I had been to the bank that day, and Arthur said, ‘Why did you not leave it at the bank?’ I answered that I did not wish to do so for private reasons, and Arthur laughed and said that it would be safer in my bureau than anywhere else. While he was speaking I noticed Mary turning pale, and she fainted right away. I put it down to her being excited and worried by the quarrel, and I helped Arthur to carry her to her room. The maid, Lucy Parr, had started at the same moment to go to her supper, and I remember that I thought it was clumsy of her to stumble against the doorpost as she went out. I was then left alone. Arthur went off to his room, and I went back to my study. I locked the door, and as a further precaution I got out the coronet and examined it. It seemed to be quite safe, and the twenty-one beryls were all in their places. Then I locked it up again and sat down to my papers. It was nearly eleven o’clock when I heard the door open, and Arthur came in. He looked very pale and disturbed. ‘Father,’ he said, ‘give me a hundred pounds.’ I was surprised, for I give him a fairly liberal allowance, and there are no extra expenses that I know of. I told him that I had no hundred pounds to give him, and that I had only fifty in the whole house. ‘Then you must get it for me somehow,’ said he. ‘I have debts at the club which must be paid to-morrow, and if they are not there will be a scandal.’ ‘My dear boy,’ I said, ‘you really must not get into debt. I cannot help you, for I have bills to meet myself.’ ‘You must help me!’ he cried. ‘You shall help me! I won’t be ruined for want of a hundred pounds. I swear I won’t! By heaven, if you don’t act like a father to me, I shall remember that you are only a guardian!’ I was exceedingly angry, as you can imagine, for I am not a hard man, but I have my own liabilities, and the thought that he should treat me so after all that I have done for him exasperated me. I answered him hotly, for I am quick-tempered, and we said some bitter words to each other. It ended in his going out slamming the door, and my sitting down again to my papers, half angry and half sorry that I should have been so harsh. It was twelve o’clock before I thought of going to bed. I always take the precaution of going round the house myself and seeing that everything is safe. I think it is the anxiety about the coronet which has made me so careful. As I went round the hall, I saw Mary’s light still burning, and I stopped to ask her if she was feeling better. ‘Dear father,’ she cried, ‘come in and close the door. I want to speak to you.’ I came in, and she was sitting up in bed with her head in her hands. ‘Oh, father,’ she cried, ‘I have something so dreadful to tell you! It is about Lucy Parr.’ ‘Your maid?’ ‘Yes, father. You know that she is engaged to a young fellow in the neighbourhood. Well, she goes out to see him. I thought it was back-door work, father, and I thought also that I would break her of it. I knew that they met somewhere near the shrubbery, and I was determined to find out if they did it when they should be in their beds. So I waited up, and when I heard the door close I came down and peeped out of the hall window. It was dark, so I could not see the man’s face, but I saw them together quite plainly, and she was whispering to him. She stood there for at least ten minutes, and then she slipped in again.’ ‘You should not encourage her to do such things, Mary.’ ‘No, father, I know I should not, but I was so interested in this that I forgot everything else. Look here, father, I have been all round to see that all was safe, and I found this window open.’ It was the hall window which she pointed to. I remember now that being a French window, which reaches down to the ground, it could be opened from the outside. I have afterwards doubted whether Mary closed it again. It would have been more natural for her to fasten the two bolts at the bottom, but I afterwards found that they were not fastened. My mind, however, was at ease that night, and I remember that I answered her, ‘You should not go unfastening windows at night, child. It is dangerous.’ ‘It was not fastened, father,’ said she. ‘Well, you should fasten it before you go to bed.’ ‘I will, father, and I will lock the door as well.’ So it appears that they were both open. She assured me now that she had fastened them both, and thinking that my house was perfectly secure, I went to my room and threw myself upon my bed. I could not sleep, however, for the words and looks of my son kept coming back to my mind, and I knew that something dreadful was hanging over us. I lay awake until about two in the morning, when I heard a slight sound coming from the dressing-room which opens into my bedroom. I got up at once, and creeping to the door, I pepped through the crack, and there, in the dim light of the early morning, I saw my son, Arthur, standing by the bureau with the coronet in his hands. He was working at it, and I could see that he was wrenching at it. I rushed into the room and cried, ‘Arthur, you villain! You have stolen the coronet!’ He dropped it at once, and it rolled upon the floor. I picked it up and saw at a glance that the corner of it was broken, and that three of the beryls were missing. ‘You have broken it! You have broken it!’ I cried. ‘And you have taken three of the stones. You have ruined me and disgraced me for ever!’ ‘Father,’ he cried, ‘don’t speak to me like that. I am not a thief. I did not take the stones. I have not broken it.’ ‘You lie, you villain!’ I shouted. ‘You have done it! You have ruined me! Give me the stones! Give me the stones!’ I was so mad with rage that I could hardly speak. I seized him by the collar and shook him. ‘Give me the stones!’ I cried. ‘We are ruined if you do not. Give me the stones, and I will forgive you everything!’ He looked at me with a white, set face, and he said, ‘I have nothing to give you. I have not got the stones.’ I could not believe him, for his whole manner showed that he was guilty. I was beside myself with rage, and I would have struck him if he had not broken away from me and rushed out of the room. I followed him, and we stood in the hall, he pale and defiant, and I mad with rage. ‘I will have the police in,’ I cried. ‘I will have you arrested. I will have you searched.’ ‘Do what you like,’ said he. ‘I have nothing to fear. I have not got the stones.’ It was at this moment that the whole house was aroused. Mary rushed out of her room, and the maid and the man-servant were at the top of the stairs. We were a dreadful group, I can tell you, father, the son with the broken coronet, the father mad with rage, and the others staring at us with white faces. Mary saw the coronet in my hands, and she screamed and fainted. I had to leave Arthur and attend to her. When she came to, she implored me to forgive him, but I was deaf to her entreaties. I called the police in at once. They came, a sergeant and a constable, and I told them what had happened. Arthur was standing by the window, and he said, ‘You are going to charge me, father?’ ‘Yes,’ I said, ‘I am going to charge you. It is a public matter now. It is a national treasure.’ ‘You will allow me five minutes in my room alone,’ said he. ‘No,’ I said, ‘not a moment. What do you want to do",

We neither of us care for it.”\n“That is unusual in a young girl.”\n“She is of a quiet nature. Besides, she is not so very young.

You are doing what you can for him and for me. But it is too heavy a task. What was he doing there at all? If his purpose were innocent, why did he not say so?”\n“Precisely. And if it were guilty, why did he not invent a lie? His silence appears to me to cut both ways. There are several singular points about the case. What did the police think of the noise which awoke you from your sleep?”\n“They considered that it might be caused by Arthur’s closing his bedroom door.”\n“A likely story! As if a man bent on felony would slam his door so as to wake a household. What did they say, then, of the disappearance of these gems?”\n“They are still sounding the planking and probing the furniture in the hope of finding them.”\n“Have they thought of looking outside the house?”\n“Yes, they have shown extraordinary energy. The whole garden has already been minutely examined.”\n“Now, my dear sir,” said Holmes, “is it not obvious to you now that this matter really strikes very much deeper than either you or the police were at first inclined to think? It appeared to you to be a simple case; to me it seems exceedingly complex. Consider what is involved by your theory. You suppose that your son came down from his bed, went, at great risk, to your dressing-room, opened your bureau, took out your coronet, broke off by main force a small portion of it, went off to some other place, concealed three gems out of the thirty-nine, with such skill that nobody can find them, and then returned with the other thirty-six into the room in which he exposed himself to the greatest danger of being discovered. I ask you now, is such a theory tenable?”\n“But what other is there?” cried the banker with a gesture of despair. “If his motives were innocent, why does he not explain them?”\n“It is our task to find that out,” replied Holmes; “so now, if you please, Mr. Holder, we will set off for Streatham together, and devote an hour to glancing a little more closely into details.”\nMy friend insisted upon my accompanying them in their expedition, which I was eager enough to do, for my curiosity and sympathy were deeply stirred by the story to which we had listened. I confess that the guilt of the banker’s son appeared to me to be as obvious as it did to his unhappy father, but still I had such faith in Holmes’ judgment that I felt that there must be some grounds for hope as long as he was dissatisfied with the accepted explanation. He hardly spoke a word the whole way out to the southern suburb, but sat with his chin upon his breast and his hat drawn over his eyes, sunk in the deepest thought. Our client appeared to have taken fresh heart at the little glimpse of hope which had been presented to him, and he even broke into a desultory chat with me over his business affairs.",

          "text_segment": "A short railway journey and a shorter walk brought us to Fairbank, the modest residence of the great financier.\nFairbank was a good-sized square house of white stone, standing back a little from the road. A double carriage-sweep, with a snow-clad lawn, stretched down in front to two large iron gates which closed the entrance. On the right side was a small wooden thicket, which led into a narrow path between two neat hedges stretching from the road to the kitchen door, and forming the tradesmen’s entrance. On the left ran a lane which led to the stables, and was not itself within the grounds at all, being a public, though little used, thoroughfare. Holmes left us standing at the door and walked slowly all round the house, across the front, down the tradesmen’s path, and so round by the garden behind into the stable lane. So long was he that Mr. Holder and I went into the dining-room and waited by the fire until he should return. We were sitting there in silence when the door opened and a young lady came in. She was rather above the middle height, slim, with dark hair and eyes, which seemed the darker against the absolute pallor of her skin. I do not think that I have ever seen such deadly paleness in a woman’s face. Her lips, too, were bloodless, but her eyes were flushed with crying. As she swept silently into the room she impressed me with a greater sense of grief than the banker had done in the morning, and it was the more striking in her as she was evidently a woman of strong character, with immense capacity for self-restraint. Disregarding my presence, she went straight to her uncle and passed her hand over his head with a sweet womanly caress.\n“You have given orders that Arthur should be liberated, have you not, dad?” she asked.\n“No, no, my girl, the matter must be probed to the bottom.”\n“But I am so sure that he is innocent. You know what woman’s instincts are. I know that he has done no harm and that you will be sorry for having acted so harshly.”\n“Why is he silent, then, if he is innocent?”\n“Who knows? Perhaps because he was so angry that you should suspect him.”\n“How could I help suspecting him, when I actually saw him with the coronet in his hand?”\n“Oh, but he had only picked it up to look at it. Oh, do, do take my word for it that he is innocent. Let the matter drop and say no more. It is so dreadful to think of our dear Arthur in prison!”\n“I shall never let it drop until the gems are found—never, Mary! Your affection for Arthur blinds you as to the awful consequences to me. Far from hushing the thing up, I have brought a gentleman down from London to inquire more deeply into it.”\n“This gentleman?” she asked, facing round to me.\n“No, his friend. He wished us to leave him alone. He is round in the stable lane now.”\n“The stable lane?” She raised her dark eyebrows. “What can he hope to find there? Ah! this, I suppose, is he. I trust, sir, that you will succeed in proving, what I feel sure is the truth, that my cousin Arthur is innocent of this crime.”\n“I fully share your opinion, and I trust, with you, that we may prove it,” returned Holmes, going back to the mat to knock the snow from his shoes. “I believe I have the honour of addressing Miss Mary Holder. Might I ask you a question or two?”\n“Pray do, sir, if it may help to clear this horrible affair up.”\n“You heard nothing yourself last night?”\n“Nothing, until my uncle here began to speak loudly. I heard that, and I came down.”\n“You shut up the windows and doors the night before. Did you fasten all the windows?”\n“Yes.”\n“Were they all fastened this morning?”\n“Yes.”\n“You have a maid who has a sweetheart? I think that you remarked to your uncle last night that she had been out to see him?”\n“Yes, and she was the girl who waited in the drawing-room, and who may have heard uncle’s remarks about the coronet.”\n“I see. You infer that she may have gone out to tell her sweetheart, and that the two may have planned the robbery.”\n“But what is the good of all these vague theories,” cried the banker impatiently, “when I have told you that I saw Arthur with the coronet in his hands?”\n“Wait a little, Mr. Holder. We must come back to that. About this girl, Miss Holder. You saw her return by the kitchen door, I presume?”\n“Yes; when I went to see if the door was fastened for the night I met her slipping in. I saw the man, too, in the gloom.”\n“Do you know him?”\n“Oh, yes! he is the greengrocer who brings our vegetables round. His name is Francis Prosper.”\n“He stood,” said Holmes, “to the left of the door—that is to say, farther up the path than is necessary to reach the door?”\n“Yes, he did.”\n“And he is a man with a wooden leg?”\nSomething like fear sprang up in the young lady’s expressive black eyes. “Why, you are like a magician,” said she. “How do you know that?” She smiled, but there was no answering smile in Holmes’ thin, eager face.\n“I should be very glad now to go upstairs,” said he. “I shall probably wish to go over the outside of the house again. Perhaps I had better take a look at the lower windows before I go up.”\nHe walked swiftly round from one to the other, pausing only at the large one which looked from the hall onto the stable lane. This he opened and made a very careful examination of the sill with his powerful magnifying lens. “Now we shall go upstairs,” said he at last.",

              "simple_agent_extraction": "A short railway journey and a shorter walk brought us to Fairbank, the modest residence of the great financier. Fairbank is a good-sized square house of brick, standing back a little from the road, with a few evergreen bushes in the front garden. To the right there is a stable-block and coach-house, and to the left a fine old wood, which flanks the meadow-land for some distance. We had passed the lodge gates, and were walking up the drive, when I saw a man standing by the door with his hands in his pockets, and his shoulders hunched up, as if he felt the cold. He was a powerfully built fellow, with a ruddy, weather-beaten face, all roughened and lined and scarred with his fifty years of anxious work. His eyes were eager, but anxious, and he had ruffled his hair up until it stood on end. He was our client, Mr. Alexander Holder, the great banker. As we approached he came down to meet us, and held out a trembling hand.\n\n“It is good of you to come, Mr. Holmes,” said he. “It is really essential that I should have your advice, and I was never more glad to see anyone in my life. You are just in time, for our police are in the house now, examining into everything.”\n\n“Let us go in, then.”\n\n“I had an urgent telegram from my son Arthur,” said Watson, “imploring me to come down.”\n\n“He was arrested this morning,” said the banker, his voice husky with emotion. “It was at four o’clock that the police came.”\n\n“Good heavens! Upon what charge?”\n\n“Upon the charge of having stolen the Beryl Coronet, which was deposited at my bank.”\n\n“This is very dreadful, indeed,” said I, as we walked up the drive. “So young, too, and with such prospects before him! I can hardly believe it.”\n\n“It is a dreadful thing for a father to have to say,” said Holder, “but I fear that the evidence against him is so strong that there can be no doubt. He was taken in the act.”\n\n“How? In the act?”\n\n“I will tell you all about it when we are in the house. My brother is with him now, but I fear that it is useless to attempt to comfort him. Let us go in, Mr. Holmes, and I will explain the whole matter to you.”\n\nWe were ushered into a large, comfortable dining-room, with a bright fire blazing in the grate. Mr. Holder motioned us to our chairs, and then, standing upon the hearth-rug, he told us the story of the Beryl Coronet.\n\n“It is a story which I would not tell to anyone but you, Mr. Holmes,” said he. “It is a story which touches my honour, and the honour of my family. But I have no choice. I must tell you everything.”\n\nHe then proceeded to relate the events which I have already described, and which led to the arrest of his son. When he had finished, he sank into a chair, and covered his face with his hands.\n\n“This is a terrible blow to me, Mr. Holmes,” said he. “My son, my only son, accused of such a crime! It is more than I can bear.”\n\n“Let us hope that he is innocent,” said I.\n\n“I fear that there can be no doubt,” said Holder. “The evidence is too strong.”\n\n“Let us examine the evidence,” said Holmes. “It is not always what it seems.”\n\n“I have told you all that I know,” said Holder. “I saw him with my own eyes.”\n\n“That is certainly a strong point,” said Holmes. “But let us not despair. There may be some explanation.”\n\n“I can think of none,” said Holder. “It is a mystery to me.”\n\n“Let us go upstairs and see the room,” said Holmes. “Perhaps we may find some clue there.”\n\nWe went upstairs, and Mr. Holder led us into the room where the coronet had been kept. It was a large, handsomely furnished room, with a writing-table in the centre, and a number of chairs and sofas scattered about. Upon the writing-table lay the coronet, or rather, what was left of it. It was a magnificent piece of work, a circle of gold, with thirty-nine beryls of the finest quality, and a number of smaller stones. But three of the beryls were missing, and the gold was bent and twisted in several places.\n\n“You see,” said Holder, “it has been broken. And three of the stones are gone.”\n\n“Who could have done this?” said I.\n\n“That is what I want to know,” said Holder. “I fear that it was my son.”\n\n“But why should he do such a thing?”\n\n“I cannot imagine. He has always been a good son to me.”\n\n“Let us examine the room,” said Holmes. “Perhaps we may find some clue.”\n\nHe went over to the window, and examined the fastenings. “The window was not opened,” said he. “And the door was locked from the inside. It is clear that the person who did this was in the room when the door was locked.”\n\n“That is what I thought,” said Holder. “And my son was in the room.”\n\n“That is certainly a strong point,” said Holmes. “But let us not despair. There may be some explanation.”\n\n“I can think of none,” said Holder. “It is a mystery to me.”\n\n“Let us go downstairs and examine the house,” said Holmes. “Perhaps we may find some clue there.”\n\nWe went downstairs, and Holmes began his examination of the house. He went from room to room, examining everything with the greatest care. He paid particular attention to the windows and doors, and to the locks and fastenings. He also examined the grounds, walking all round the house, and paying particular attention to the tradesmen’s path and the stable lane. Mr. Holder and I waited in the dining-room while he conducted his investigation.\n\nA young lady entered the room. She was a striking figure, tall and graceful, with a pale, drawn face, and eyes that were red with weeping. She was dressed in black, and her hair was simply arranged. I had never seen a face which was more expressive of grief, and yet of a strong character and self-restraint. She went directly to Mr. Holder, and laying her hand upon his head, she said, “Uncle, has Arthur been liberated?”\n\n“No, my dear, not yet,” said he. “The matter must be investigated fully.”\n\n“But he is innocent, Uncle! I know he is innocent!” she cried, with a passion which surprised me. “You must believe me! You must drop this matter! It is killing him to be in prison!”\n\n“My dear Mary,” said Holder, “I fear that there can be no doubt. The evidence is too strong.”\n\n“But you must find the gems, Uncle! You must find the gems!” she cried. “Then he will be free!”\n\n“I am doing my best, my dear,” said he. “I have brought down a gentleman from London to investigate the matter further.”\n\nShe turned her eyes upon Holmes, who had just entered the room. “Is this the gentleman?” she asked. “Oh, sir, I implore you to prove my cousin’s innocence! I know that he is innocent!”\n\n“I am of the same opinion, madam,” said Holmes. “And I will do my best to prove it. Now, I must ask you a few questions.”\n\n“I will answer anything,” she said.\n",

Mr. Holder motioned us to our chairs, and then, standing upon the hearth-rug, he told us the story of the Beryl Coronet.\n\n“It is a story which I would not tell to anyone but you, Mr. Holmes,” said he. “It is a story which touches my honour, and the honour of my family. But I have no choice. I must tell you everything.”\n\nHe then proceeded to relate the events which I have already described, and which led to the arrest of his son. When he had finished, he sank into a chair, and covered his face with his hands.\n\n“This is a terrible blow to me, Mr. Holmes,” said he. “My son, my only son, accused of such a crime! It is more than I can bear.”\n\n“Let us hope that he is innocent,” said I.\n\n“I fear that there can be no doubt,” said Holder. “The evidence is too strong.”\n\n“Let us examine the evidence,” said Holmes. “It is not always what it seems.”\n\n“I have told you all that I know,” said Holder. “I saw him with my own eyes.”\n\n“That is certainly a strong point,” said Holmes. “But let us not despair. There may be some explanation.”\n\n“I can think of none,” said Holder. “It is a mystery to me.”\n\n“Let us go upstairs and see the room,” said Holmes. “Perhaps we may find some clue there.”\n\nWe went upstairs, and Mr. Holder led us into the room where the coronet had been kept. It was a large, handsomely furnished room, with a writing-table in the centre, and a number of chairs and sofas scattered about. Upon the writing-table lay the coronet, or rather, what was left of it. It was a magnificent piece of work, a circle of gold, with thirty-nine beryls of the finest quality, and a number of smaller stones. But three of the beryls were missing, and the gold was bent and twisted in several places.\n\n“You see,” said Holder, “it has been broken. And three of the stones are gone.”\n\n“Who could have done this?” said I.\n\n“That is what I want to know,” said Holder. “I fear that it was my son.”\n\n“But why should he do such a thing?”\n\n“I cannot imagine. He has always been a good son to me.”\n\n“Let us examine the room,” said Holmes. “Perhaps we may find some clue.”\n\nHe went over to the window, and examined the fastenings. “The window was not opened,” said he. “And the door was locked from the inside. It is clear that the person who did this was in the room when the door was locked.”\n\n“That is what I thought,” said Holder. “And my son was in the room.”\n\n“That is certainly a strong point,” said Holmes. “But let us not despair. There may be some explanation.”\n\n“I can think of none,” said Holder. “It is a mystery to me.”\n\n“Let us go downstairs and examine the house,” said Holmes. “Perhaps we may find some clue there.”\n\nWe went downstairs, and Holmes began his examination of the house. He went from room to room, examining everything with the greatest care. He paid particular attention to the windows and doors, and to the locks and fastenings. He also examined the grounds, walking all round the house, and paying particular attention to the tradesmen’s path and the stable lane. Mr. Holder and I waited in the dining-room while he conducted his investigation.\n\nA young lady entered the room. She was a striking figure, tall and graceful, with a pale, drawn face, and eyes that were red with weeping. She was dressed in black, and her hair was simply arranged. I had never seen a face which was more expressive of grief, and yet of a strong character and self-restraint. She went directly to Mr. Holder, and laying her hand upon his head, she said, “Uncle, has Arthur been liberated?”\n\n“No, my dear, not yet,” said he. “The matter must be investigated fully.”\n\n“But he is innocent, Uncle! I know he is innocent!” she cried, with a passion which surprised me. “You must believe me! You must drop this matter! It is killing him to be in prison!”\n\n“My dear Mary,” said Holder, “I fear that there can be no doubt. The evidence is too strong.”\n\n“But you must find the gems, Uncle! You must find the gems!” she cried. “Then he will be free!”\n\n“I am doing my best, my dear,” said he. “I have brought down a gentleman from London to investigate the matter further.”\n\nShe turned her eyes upon Holmes, who had just entered the room. “Is this the gentleman?” she asked. “Oh, sir, I implore you to prove my cousin’s innocence! I know that he is innocent!”\n\n“I am of the same opinion, madam,” said Holmes. “And I will do my best to prove it. Now, I must ask you a few questions.”\n\n“I will answer anything,” she said.\n",

          "text_segment": "The banker’s dressing-room was a plainly furnished little chamber, with a grey carpet, a large bureau, and a long mirror. Holmes went to the bureau first and looked hard at the lock.\n“Which key was used to open it?” he asked.\n“That which my son himself indicated—that of the cupboard of the lumber-room.”\n“Have you it here?”\n“That is it on the dressing-table.”\nSherlock Holmes took it up and opened the bureau.\n“It is a noiseless lock,” said he. “It is no wonder that it did not wake you. This case, I presume, contains the coronet. We must have a look at it.” He opened the case, and taking out the diadem he laid it upon the table. It was a magnificent specimen of the jeweller’s art, and the thirty-six stones were the finest that I have ever seen. At one side of the coronet was a cracked edge, where a corner holding three gems had been torn away.\n“Now, Mr. Holder,” said Holmes, “here is the corner which corresponds to that which has been so unfortunately lost. Might I beg that you will break it off.”\nThe banker recoiled in horror. “I should not dream of trying,” said he.\n“Then I will.” Holmes suddenly bent his strength upon it, but without result. “I feel it give a little,” said he; “but, though I am exceptionally strong in the fingers, it would take me all my time to break it. An ordinary man could not do it. Now, what do you think would happen if I did break it, Mr. Holder? There would be a noise like a pistol shot. Do you tell me that all this happened within a few yards of your bed and that you heard nothing of it?”\n“I do not know what to think. It is all dark to me.”\n“But perhaps it may grow lighter as we go. What do you think, Miss Holder?”\n“I confess that I still share my uncle’s perplexity.”\n“Your son had no shoes or slippers on when you saw him?”\n“He had nothing on save only his trousers and shirt.”\n“Thank you. We have certainly been favoured with extraordinary luck during this inquiry, and it will be entirely our own fault if we do not succeed in clearing the matter up. With your permission, Mr. Holder, I shall now continue my investigations outside.”\nHe went alone, at his own request, for he explained that any unnecessary footmarks might make his task more difficult. For an hour or more he was at work, returning at last with his feet heavy with snow and his features as inscrutable as ever.\n“I think that I have seen now all that there is to see, Mr. Holder,” said he; “I can serve you best by returning to my rooms.”\n“But the gems, Mr. Holmes. Where are they?”\n“I cannot tell.”\nThe banker wrung his hands. “I shall never see them again!” he cried. “And my son? You give me hopes?”\n“My opinion is in no way altered.”\n“Then, for God’s sake, what was this dark business which was acted in my house last night?”\n“If you can call upon me at my Baker Street rooms to-morrow morning between nine and ten I shall be happy to do what I can to make it clearer. I understand that you give me carte blanche to act for you, provided only that I get back the gems, and that you place no limit on the sum I may draw.”\n“I would give my fortune to have them back.”\n“Very good. I shall look into the matter between this and then. Good-bye; it is just possible that I may have to come over here again before evening.”\nIt was obvious to me that my companion’s mind was now made up about the case, although what his conclusions were was more than I could even dimly imagine. Several times during our homeward journey I endeavoured to sound him upon the point, but he always glided away to some other topic, until at last I gave it over in despair. It was not yet three when we found ourselves in our rooms once more.",

Holmes went at once to the bureau, and carefully examined the lock. “This is a writing bureau,” he remarked. “It is of English manufacture of the time of George IV. What do you keep in it?” “My papers of importance.” “Have you a duplicate key?” “No.” “Upon my word, you must be a very trustful man,” said Holmes, smiling. “Of course, I have a strong safe down-stairs, but I really don’t know why I should not keep my papers in this bureau.” “No doubt, no doubt. I have half a dozen of these little instruments, Mr. Holder,” he said, producing a small bunch of keys. “They are exceedingly handy.” He tried one or two of them, but without success. “No,” said he, “this is a special lock. It would take a clever man to open this bureau without the proper key; and it was opened last night.” “How do you know that, Mr. Holmes?” “How do I know it? Why, look at it yourself. There is a scratch beside the hole which could only be caused by someone fumbling at the lock with a picklock. This has not been picked, however. The two edges of the wooden hole are quite clean. This work has been done, and done again, by someone who had the proper key.” “The proper key is on my chain, and it never leaves my possession,” said the banker. “Indeed,” said Holmes. “Then it was not opened with your key.” “Who could have opened it? ” “Ah, that is the question! Let us examine this coronet. He had taken a small case from the drawer, and now he laid a mass of shining metal upon the table. Our eyes were dazzled by the blaze of thirty-six enormous beryls, glowing with a rich blue light. “There are thirty-six,” said Holmes, as he counted them. “That is twelve on each side of the three arms. How many were missing?” “Three.” “And you say that they were on this arm?” He pointed to the jagged end where a piece of the coronet was broken. “Yes.” “Now, of course, we must take it for granted that the man who took the stones was the man who broke the coronet.” “Yes.” “And he broke it in the struggle to get the stones out?” “He must have done so. My boy was not strong enough to break it.” “Well, I am not so sure of that,” said Holmes. “Let me see. He took the coronet from the drawer. He rushed out of the room. He was pursued, and he struggled. That is your theory, is it not?” “It is mine, and it is the only one which will explain the facts.” “Well, now, let me test it. In the first place, is it possible for a man to break this coronet with his hands?” “Yes, I am sure that he could, if he exerted his full strength.” “Let me see.” Holmes took the coronet in his hands, and he tried to bend it. He exerted his full strength, but he could not bend it. “It is very strong,” he said. “It is made of the finest gold, and it is very thick. It would take a very strong man to break it.” “I am sure that Arthur could do it,” said the banker. “He is a very strong young man.” “I have no doubt that he is strong, but I am not sure that he could break this coronet. Let me see. He took the coronet from the drawer. He rushed out of the room. He was pursued, and he struggled.

You are a powerful man.” The banker shrank back in horror. “I should as soon break off a piece of my own flesh,” said he. “Well, then, I will try myself.” Holmes took the coronet in his hands again, and he exerted his strength. He could not break it, but I observed that he bent it slightly. “Well,” said he, “I have no doubt that a man of great strength could break it, but it would take a very strong man, and it would make a very loud noise. It would be like the crack of a pistol. How could such a thing happen here, close to your bed, and you hear nothing?” “I am sure that I do not know. I was asleep.” “I have no doubt that you were. And Mary, did you hear nothing?” “No, I heard nothing,” said she. “And Arthur, did he wear shoes or slippers when he was found?” “No, he was barefooted.” “Well, that is very important. Now, Mr. Holder, I have seen all that I need to see in this room. I shall go outside and look about.” “There are no footprints in the snow,” said the banker. “I have seen to that myself.” “Well, I shall see for myself,” said Holmes.

            "prefix-probing": "The banker’s dressing-room was a plainly furnished little chamber, with a grey carpet, a large bureau, and a long mirror. There were two doors, one leading, as we imagined, to the bedroom, and the other to a passage. Holmes’s first action was to shut the door which opened into the passage, and then to produce a strong magnifying glass and a coil of measuring tape. The carpet was grey and worn, but it was clean. Holmes dropped upon his knees, and with the glass in his hand he examined the floor all round the edges of the room, and especially round the legs of the great bureau. Presently he got up and looked at the walls, then he went over to the window, and finally he took a tap with his stick upon the carpet. He smiled to himself, and then he walked over to the bureau and examined it with the greatest attention. He measured the width and depth of it, and then he measured the distance from the wall on either side of it. ‘In every case,’ said he, ‘the measurement is the same. This bureau is four feet three inches wide, and it is exactly four feet three inches from the wall on either side. It is a fixture, you see, and it has not been moved for years.’\n\nHe then went over to the window, and, after a long look, he turned away with a frown. ‘I confess that I am not quite satisfied, Watson,’ said he. ‘However, it is as I expected. Come, let us go.’\n\nWe went out into the passage, and Holmes locked the door behind us. ‘Now, Mr. Wilson,’ said he, ‘I think that we have done enough for to-day. I shall be able to give you a definite answer to-morrow morning. It is a case of considerable interest, and I shall be glad to have a little time to turn it over in my mind.’\n\nMr. Jabez Wilson was clearly disappointed, but he made no remark and we left him at his door. As we walked down the street, Holmes stopped suddenly and struck the pavement with his stick. ‘Aha!’ said he. ‘My dear Watson, I have it! It is the bank! The City and Suburban Bank is next door to the pawnbroker’s shop. That is the meaning of the tunnel. They are digging from the pawnbroker’s cellar into the bank vault.’\n\n‘But how did you know?’ I asked.\n\n‘You remember that I examined the knees of my trousers when I came back from the pawnbroker’s? I had a little chalk upon them. It was the chalk from the pavement. I had been tapping upon the pavement to see if the cellar extended out to the street. It does not. It is a small cellar. But the dressing-room is at the back of the house, and the bank is next door. The tunnel must run from the cellar, under the garden, and into the bank.’\n\n‘But why the Red-Headed League?’\n\n‘Ah, that was the bait! The advertisement was a blind. It was to get this man Wilson out of the way for a few hours every day, so that they could work in his cellar without interruption. They knew that he was a pawnbroker, and that he had a cellar. They did not know that he was a member of the Red-Headed League. That was a piece of luck for them. They invented the League, and the vacancy, and the salary, and the work, all to get him out of the house.’\n\n‘But why stop now?’\n"

          "text_segment": "He hurried to his chamber and was down again in a few minutes dressed as a common loafer. With his collar turned up, his shiny, seedy coat, his red cravat, and his worn boots, he was a perfect sample of the class.\n“I think that this should do,” said he, glancing into the glass above the fireplace. “I only wish that you could come with me, Watson, but I fear that it won’t do. I may be on the trail in this matter, or I may be following a will-o’-the-wisp, but I shall soon know which it is. I hope that I may be back in a few hours.” He cut a slice of beef from the joint upon the sideboard, sandwiched it between two rounds of bread, and thrusting this rude meal into his pocket he started off upon his expedition.\nI had just finished my tea when he returned, evidently in excellent spirits, swinging an old elastic-sided boot in his hand. He chucked it down into a corner and helped himself to a cup of tea.\n“I only looked in as I passed,” said he. “I am going right on.”\n“Where to?”\n“Oh, to the other side of the West End. It may be some time before I get back. Don’t wait up for me in case I should be late.”\n“How are you getting on?”\n“Oh, so so. Nothing to complain of. I have been out to Streatham since I saw you last, but I did not call at the house. It is a very sweet little problem, and I would not have missed it for a good deal. However, I must not sit gossiping here, but must get these disreputable clothes off and return to my highly respectable self.”\nI could see by his manner that he had stronger reasons for satisfaction than his words alone would imply. His eyes twinkled, and there was even a touch of colour upon his sallow cheeks. He hastened upstairs, and a few minutes later I heard the slam of the hall door, which told me that he was off once more upon his congenial hunt.\nI waited until midnight, but there was no sign of his return, so I retired to my room. It was no uncommon thing for him to be away for days and nights on end when he was hot upon a scent, so that his lateness caused me no surprise. I do not know at what hour he came in, but when I came down to breakfast in the morning there he was with a cup of coffee in one hand and the paper in the other, as fresh and trim as possible.\n“You will excuse my beginning without you, Watson,” said he, “but you remember that our client has rather an early appointment this morning.”\n“Why, it is after nine now,” I answered. “I should not be surprised if that were he. I thought I heard a ring.”\nIt was, indeed, our friend the financier. I was shocked by the change which had come over him, for his face which was naturally of a broad and massive mould, was now pinched and fallen in, while his hair seemed to me at least a shade whiter. He entered with a weariness and lethargy which was even more painful than his violence of the morning before, and he dropped heavily into the armchair which I pushed forward for him.\n“I do not know what I have done to be so severely tried,” said he. “Only two days ago I was a happy and prosperous man, without a care in the world. Now I am left to a lonely and dishonoured age. One sorrow comes close upon the heels of another. My niece, Mary, has deserted me.”\n“Deserted you?”\n“Yes. Her bed this morning had not been slept in, her room was empty, and a note for me lay upon the hall table. I had said to her last night, in sorrow and not in anger, that if she had married my boy all might have been well with him. Perhaps it was thoughtless of me to say so. It is to that remark that she refers in this note:\n“‘MY DEAREST UNCLE,—I feel that I have brought trouble upon you, and that if I had acted differently this terrible misfortune might never have occurred. I cannot, with this thought in my mind, ever again be happy under your roof, and I feel that I must leave you forever. Do not worry about my future, for that is provided for; and, above all, do not search for me, for it will be fruitless labour and an ill-service to me. In life or in death, I am ever your loving,\n“‘MARY.’\n“What could she mean by that note, Mr. Holmes? Do you think it points to suicide?”\n“No, no, nothing of the kind. It is perhaps the best possible solution. I trust, Mr. Holder, that you are nearing the end of your troubles.”\n“Ha! You say so! You have heard something, Mr. Holmes; you have learned something! Where are the gems?”\n“You would not think £ 1000 apiece an excessive sum for them?”\n“I would pay ten.”\n“That would be unnecessary. Three thousand will cover the matter. And there is a little reward, I fancy. Have you your cheque-book? Here is a pen. Better make it out for £ 4000.”\nWith a dazed face the banker made out the required check. Holmes walked over to his desk, took out a little triangular piece of gold with three gems in it, and threw it down upon the table.\nWith a shriek of joy our client clutched it up.\n“You have it!” he gasped. “I am saved! I am saved!”\nThe reaction of joy was as passionate as his grief had been, and he hugged his recovered gems to his bosom.\n“There is one other thing you owe, Mr. Holder,” said Sherlock Holmes rather sternly.\n“Owe!” He caught up a pen. “Name the sum, and I will pay it.”\n“No, the debt is not to me. You owe a very humble apology to that noble lad, your son, who has carried himself in this matter as I should be proud to see my own son do, should I ever chance to have one.”\n“Then it was not Arthur who took them?”\n“I told you yesterday, and I repeat to-day, that it was not.”\n“You are sure of it! Then let us hurry to him at once to let him know that the truth is known.”\n“He knows it already. When I had cleared it all up I had an interview with him, and finding that he would not tell me the story, I told it to him, on which he had to confess that I was right and to add the very few details which were not yet quite clear to me. Your news of this morning, however, may open his lips.”",

With his collar turned up, his shiny seedy coat, his frayed trousers, and his battered hat, he had transformed himself into the tramp of the streets, with a stoop of the shoulders and the shuffle of the feet which he cultivated so successfully that I could hardly believe that it was my old friend. “I can’t stop, my dear Watson,” said he; “I am off upon the trail which I hope will lead me to the heart of the mystery. It may be the right one, and it may be the wrong. I’ll know before many hours have passed.” He snatched a crust from the sideboard, buttoned it inside his waistcoat, and was gone. I waited all day, with a restless anxiety for news, but in the evening he returned with an elastic step and a beaming face. He had a boot in one hand and a whip in the other. “I’ve had a satisfactory day,” said he; “very satisfactory. It is true that I have had the advantage of a flying start by the kindness of Mr. Alexander Holder, who provided me with the exact details of the case, but I should be blamable had I not made the most of them. I think that I may say without an overplus of self-praise that I have even improved upon his data. A long walk, you see, Watson.” He held out his boot, which was chalked all over the sole and heel. “My movements have been remarkably erratic. I have been to Streatham, to Norwood, to Dulwich, to Sydenham, and to Forest Hill. The peculiarity of the case,” he remarked, “is that at every point where Mary Evans has passed she has left a track, and yet it is invisible to the eye. You understand?” “Not quite.” “Well, then, I understand that you are much puzzled by this knowledge of mine that she has taken a long walk which you cannot see.” “I confess that I am.” “You are still on the trail of the beryl coronet, then?” I asked. “Yes. I have reason to hope that I am very near the solution.” “That is good news.” “Well, so-so. I can’t say that it is sweet to my taste, Watson. For it is tinged with tragedy, that beryl coronet.” “But the gems, have you recovered them?” “No, not yet. I am only at the beginning of the end. But I have a clue, a thread which will lead me to the truth. I have no doubt of it.” He seemed to be in excellent spirits, and I could see that he was on the verge of a great discovery. He was humming a tune to himself, and his eyes were sparkling with excitement. He threw the boot and the whip into a corner and sat down to his supper. “I have been on my feet all day,” said he, “and I am as hungry as a hunter. I have had nothing but that crust since morning.” He ate a hearty meal, and then, lighting his pipe, he settled down to a long smoke. He was silent for a time, and I did not disturb him, for I knew that he was thinking deeply. Presently he looked up and said, “Watson, I have a little problem for you. Suppose that you were a man who had committed a crime, and that you were trying to escape detection. What would be the first thing that you would do?” “I should try to get as far away as possible,” I said. “Exactly. And how would you do that?” “By train, or by ship, or by any other means of conveyance.” “Precisely. Now, suppose that you had a confederate who was helping you. What would be the first thing that you would do with the plunder?” “I should divide it with him,” I said. “Quite so. Now, suppose that you had a valuable article, such as a beryl coronet, which you had stolen. What would be the first thing that you would do with it?” “I should try to sell it,” I said. “Right again. Now, suppose that you had a confederate who was helping you to sell it. What would be the first thing that you would do with the money?” “I should divide it with him,” I said. “Excellent, Watson. You are coming on famously. Now, suppose that you had a confederate who was a woman. What would be the first thing that you would do with her?” I was puzzled by this question. “I don’t know,” I said. “What would you do?” “Ah, that is the question,” said he. “What would I do? Well, I should try to get rid of her as soon as possible. For a woman is always a source of danger in a criminal enterprise.” He smoked in silence for a few minutes, and then he said, “Watson, I have a theory. It is only a theory, mind you, but I think that it will prove to be correct. I believe that the beryl coronet was stolen by a woman, and that she had a confederate who was a man.” “But who could it have been?” I asked. “Ah, that is the question,” said he. “Who could it have been? Well, I have a suspicion, but I will not mention it yet. I must have more proof.” He smoked on, and I sat in silence, wondering who the woman could be. Presently he looked at his watch. “It is nearly midnight,” said he. “I must be off.” “Where are you going?” I asked. “To the West End,” said he. “I have a little matter to attend to there.” He rose and put on his coat. “Don’t wait up for me, Watson,” said he. “I may be late.” He left the room, and I heard the front door close behind him. I sat by the fire for a long time, thinking over what he had said. I was more puzzled than ever. Who could the woman be? And who was her confederate? I could not imagine. At last I went to bed, but I could not sleep. My mind was full of the beryl coronet and the mysterious woman. I tossed and turned, and it was not until the early hours of the morning that I fell into a troubled sleep. When I awoke, the sun was shining brightly, and I heard Holmes’s voice in the next room. I rose and dressed, and went into the sitting-room. Holmes was sitting at the table, with a cup of coffee beside him, and a newspaper in his hand. He looked as fresh and trim as possible. “You are early, Watson,” said he. “Our client will be here directly.” In a few minutes I heard the front door open, and the heavy tread of Mr. Holder upon the stairs. He entered the room with a face which was even paler and more drawn than before. “You will excuse my coming so early, Mr. Holmes,” said he. “But I was up all night, and I could not rest until I had seen you. I have a new misfortune.” “An additional one?” asked Holmes. “Yes, Mr. Holmes, an additional one. My daughter Mary has disappeared.” “Disappeared!” “Yes, Mr. Holmes. She is gone. Her bed was not slept in, and her room was empty. She left a note upon the hall table.” “What did it say?” asked Holmes. He handed the note to Holmes. It was written in a clear, firm hand. “My dearest father,” it said, “I feel that I have brought disgrace upon you, and that I can never be happy again under your roof. I have therefore decided to leave you. Do not search for me, for it will be in vain. My future is provided for. Your unhappy daughter, Mary.” “What do you think of that, Mr. Holmes?” said Mr. Holder. “It is a clear case of suicide,” said he. “No, no, Mr. Holder. Not so bad as that,” said Holmes. “It is a clear case of flight, but not of suicide.” “But where can she have gone?” “Ah, that is the question,” said Holmes. “Where can she have gone? Well, I think that I can tell you that. She has gone to the person who was her confederate in the theft of the beryl coronet.” Mr. Holder stared at him with a blank face. “Her confederate!” he cried. “But who could it have been?” “Ah, that is the question,” said Holmes. “Who could it have been? Well, I think that I can tell you that too. It was Sir George Burnwell.” Mr. Holder sank back in his chair with a groan. “Sir George Burnwell!” he cried. “But he is a friend of the family.” “So I understand,” said Holmes. “But he is also a scoundrel.” “But how did you find out?” “Ah, that is my secret,” said Holmes. “But I can assure you that I am right.

            "They struggled; Arthur struck Burnwell over the eye. The coronet snapped, Arthur regained the main part, rushed back inside, closed the window, went to Holder's room, and was trying to straighten the twisted coronet when Holder discovered him.",
            "Holder's accusations angered Arthur, who felt he deserved thanks.",

And let me say to you, first, that which it is hardest for me to say and for you to hear: there has been an understanding between Sir George Burnwell and your niece Mary. They have now fled together.”\n“My Mary? Impossible!”\n“It is unfortunately more than possible; it is certain. Neither you nor your son knew the true character of this man when you admitted him into your family circle. He is one of the most dangerous men in England—a ruined gambler, an absolutely desperate villain, a man without heart or conscience. Your niece knew nothing of such men. When he breathed his vows to her, as he had done to a hundred before her, she flattered herself that she alone had touched his heart. The devil knows best what he said, but at least she became his tool and was in the habit of seeing him nearly every evening.”\n“I cannot, and I will not, believe it!” cried the banker with an ashen face.\n“I will tell you, then, what occurred in your house last night. Your niece, when you had, as she thought, gone to your room, slipped down and talked to her lover through the window which leads into the stable lane. His footmarks had pressed right through the snow, so long had he stood there. She told him of the coronet. His wicked lust for gold kindled at the news, and he bent her to his will. I have no doubt that she loved you, but there are women in whom the love of a lover extinguishes all other loves, and I think that she must have been one. She had hardly listened to his instructions when she saw you coming downstairs, on which she closed the window rapidly and told you about one of the servants’ escapade with her wooden-legged lover, which was all perfectly true.\n“Your boy, Arthur, went to bed after his interview with you but he slept badly on account of his uneasiness about his club debts. In the middle of the night he heard a soft tread pass his door, so he rose and, looking out, was surprised to see his cousin walking very stealthily along the passage until she disappeared into your dressing-room. Petrified with astonishment, the lad slipped on some clothes and waited there in the dark to see what would come of this strange affair. Presently she emerged from the room again, and in the light of the passage-lamp your son saw that she carried the precious coronet in her hands. She passed down the stairs, and he, thrilling with horror, ran along and slipped behind the curtain near your door, whence he could see what passed in the hall beneath. He saw her stealthily open the window, hand out the coronet to someone in the gloom, and then closing it once more hurry back to her room, passing quite close to where he stood hid behind the curtain.\n“As long as she was on the scene he could not take any action without a horrible exposure of the woman whom he loved. But the instant that she was gone he realised how crushing a misfortune this would be for you, and how all-important it was to set it right. He rushed down, just as he was, in his bare feet, opened the window, sprang out into the snow, and ran down the lane, where he could see a dark figure in the moonlight. Sir George Burnwell tried to get away, but Arthur caught him, and there was a struggle between them, your lad tugging at one side of the coronet, and his opponent at the other. In the scuffle, your son struck Sir George and cut him over the eye. Then something suddenly snapped, and your son, finding that he had the coronet in his hands, rushed back, closed the window, ascended to your room, and had just observed that the coronet had been twisted in the struggle and was endeavouring to straighten it when you appeared upon the scene.”\n“Is it possible?” gasped the banker.\n“You then roused his anger by calling him names at a moment when he felt that he had deserved your warmest thanks. He could not explain the true state of affairs without betraying one who certainly deserved little enough consideration at his hands. He took the more chivalrous view, however, and preserved her secret.”\n“And that was why she shrieked and fainted when she saw the coronet,” cried Mr. Holder. “Oh, my God! what a blind fool I have been! And his asking to be allowed to go out for five minutes! The dear fellow wanted to see if the missing piece were at the scene of the struggle. How cruelly I have misjudged him!”\n“When I arrived at the house,” continued Holmes, “I at once went very carefully round it to observe if there were any traces in the snow which might help me. I knew that none had fallen since the evening before, and also that there had been a strong frost to preserve impressions. I passed along the tradesmen’s path, but found it all trampled down and indistinguishable. Just beyond it, however, at the far side of the kitchen door, a woman had stood and talked with a man, whose round impressions on one side showed that he had a wooden leg. I could even tell that they had been disturbed, for the woman had run back swiftly to the door, as was shown by the deep toe and light heel marks, while Wooden-leg had waited a little, and then had gone away. I thought at the time that this might be the maid and her sweetheart, of whom you had already spoken to me, and inquiry showed it was so. I passed round the garden without seeing anything more than random tracks, which I took to be the police; but when I got into the stable lane a very long and complex story was written in the snow in front of me.\n“There was a double line of tracks of a booted man, and a second double line which I saw with delight belonged to a man with naked feet. I was at once convinced from what you had told me that the latter was your son. The first had walked both ways, but the other had run swiftly, and as his tread was marked in places over the depression of the boot, it was obvious that he had passed after the other. I followed them up and found they led to the hall window, where Boots had worn all the snow away while waiting. Then I walked to the other end, which was a hundred yards or more down the lane. I saw where Boots had faced round, where the snow was cut up as though there had been a struggle, and, finally, where a few drops of blood had fallen, to show me that I was not mistaken. Boots had then run down the lane, and another little smudge of blood showed that it was he who had been hurt. When he came to the high road at the other end, I found that the pavement had been cleared, so there was an end to that clue.\n“On entering the house, however, I examined, as you remember, the sill and framework of the hall window with my lens, and I could at once see that someone had passed out. I could distinguish the outline of an instep where the wet foot had been placed in coming in. I was then beginning to be able to form an opinion as to what had occurred. A man had waited outside the window; someone had brought the gems; the deed had been overseen by your son; he had pursued the thief; had struggled with him; they had each tugged at the coronet, their united strength causing injuries which neither alone could have effected. He had returned with the prize, but had left a fragment in the grasp of his opponent. So far I was clear. The question now was, who was the man, and who was it brought him the coronet?\n“It is an old maxim of mine that when you have excluded the impossible, whatever remains, however improbable, must be the truth. Now, I knew that it was not you who had brought it down, so there only remained your niece and the maids. But if it were the maids, why should your son allow himself to be accused in their place? There could be no possible reason. As he loved his cousin, however, there was an excellent explanation why he should retain her secret—the more so as the secret was a disgraceful one. When I remembered that you had seen her at that window, and how she had fainted on seeing the coronet again, my conjecture became a certainty.\n“And who could it be who was her confederate? A lover evidently, for who else could outweigh the love and gratitude which she must feel to you? I knew that you went out little, and that your circle of friends was a very limited one. But among them was Sir George Burnwell. I had heard of him before as being a man of evil reputation among women. It must have been he who wore those boots and retained the missing gems. Even though he knew that Arthur had discovered him, he might still flatter himself that he was safe, for the lad could not say a word without compromising his own family.\n“Well, your own good sense will suggest what measures I took next. I went in the shape of a loafer to Sir George’s house, managed to pick up an acquaintance with his valet, learned that his master had cut his head the night before, and, finally, at the expense of six shillings, made all sure by buying a pair of his cast-off shoes. With these I journeyed down to Streatham and saw that they exactly fitted the tracks.”\n“I saw an ill-dressed vagabond in the lane yesterday evening,” said Mr. Holder.\n“Precisely. It was I. I found that I had my man, so I came home and changed my clothes. It was a delicate part which I had to play then, for I saw that a prosecution must be avoided to avert scandal, and I knew that so astute a villain would see that our hands were tied in the matter. I went and saw him. At first, of course, he denied everything. But when I gave him every particular that had occurred, he tried to bluster and took down a life-preserver from the wall. I knew my man, however, and I clapped a pistol to his head before he could strike. Then he became a little more reasonable. I told him that we would give him a price for the stones he held—£ 1000 apiece. That brought out the first signs of grief that he had shown. ‘Why, dash it all!’ said he, ‘I’ve let them go at six hundred for the three!’ I soon managed to get the address of the receiver who had them, on promising him that there would be no prosecution. Off I set to him, and after much chaffering I got our stones at £ 1000 apiece. Then I looked in upon your son, told him that all was right, and eventually got to my bed about two o’clock, after what I may call a really hard day’s work.”",

Why did she faint exactly at that moment, and not before?”\n“Well, why?”\n“Because it was her supreme danger. She knew that the coronet was gone, that you had discovered its absence, and that you were about to accuse Arthur. Her one hope was to distract your attention, and she did it by a feigned attack of hysteria. But she was too slow. You had already said the words which she dreaded.”\n“And Arthur?”\n“Arthur was innocent. He was, however, imprudent. He should have told you all that he saw.”\n“What did he see?”\n“He saw his cousin, Mary, slip out of her room, steal down the stairs, and go into the dressing-room where the coronet was kept. He saw her return with the coronet in her hand, and he saw her pass it out of the window to someone who was waiting in the garden. He was so thunderstruck at the sight that he could not move for a moment, and then, fearing to expose her, he waited until she had gone back to her room. He then rushed down himself, and found that the person in the garden had gone. He ran down the lane, and he saw a dark figure disappearing over the wall into the road. He pursued, and in the struggle which followed he recovered the coronet, but it was broken, and he only got the larger part. The other three gems remained with the thief. He then returned, and was trying to straighten the coronet when you discovered him.”\n“And the thief?”\n“Was Sir George Burnwell. Mary Holder is his accomplice, and has been for some time. They have fled together. I have traced them as far as the Continent.”\nThe banker sank back in his chair, a ghastly figure of misery. “My God!” he cried. “My God! To think of it! To think of it! She whom I trusted, whom I loved as my own child! It is too terrible to believe!”\n“It is terrible, and yet it is true. I have the evidence here,” said Holmes, tapping his breast. “I have the three gems which were missing. I have recovered them from the receiver to whom Sir George Burnwell sold them. He got six hundred pounds for them, and I have paid a thousand apiece to get them back. The coronet is now complete once more.”\nThe banker could not speak, but he held out his hand, and Holmes placed the three glittering stones in his palm.\n“You have saved my honour, Mr. Holmes,” he stammered. “You have saved my life.”\n“Not at all. I have only done my duty. I have also done a little detective work on my own account. I have traced Sir George Burnwell, and I have recovered the gems. I have also had a little chat with Arthur, and I have explained everything to him. He is a brave lad, though a foolish one. He should have told you all that he saw. But he was afraid of exposing his cousin.”\n“And Mary?”\n“She is gone, and she will not trouble you again. Sir George Burnwell is a ruined man, and he will not trouble anyone again. I have seen to that.”\n“You have been a good friend to me, Mr. Holmes,” said the banker. “I shall never forget it.”\n“It is all in the day’s work,” said Holmes. “I have had a busy day, and I am tired. I shall go home and rest.”\nHe rose as he spoke, and I followed him out. We walked in silence to the station, and we did not speak again until we were in the train. Holmes was sunk in thought, and I did not care to interrupt him. It was past two o’clock when we reached Baker Street, and I was glad to get to bed.

You told me that in the train.”\n“No, I married her mother. She is my stepdaughter.”\n“Quite so. It is possible, therefore, that she may have interests in the world which are unknown to you. She was aware of the immense value of these stones?”\n“I am sure she was. We have all talked of them.”\n“You say that you went down to the library at quarter past ten, and that you had been there about a quarter of an hour when Arthur joined you. His bedroom, you say, is the second from the front, both of them opening into the passage. This passage is floored with wood for the most part, but ends in a few steps which lead down to the stone-flagged hall. You then, as I understand, went together from the library, escorted by the footman with his lamp, to the dressing-room, which opens out of your bedroom. It was there that you took out the coronet and placed it upon the mantelpiece.”\n“That is correct.”\n“I suppose that your niece was not aware of the exact spot where you had placed the coronet, but she knew that it was in the dressing-room?”\n“Yes, she did.”\n“And she knew also that the door of the dressing-room was not locked?”\n“Yes.”\n“Then, when you went to bed, she was aware that she had only to slip down, open the door, take out the coronet, and return to her room. She could have done this without anyone seeing her.”\n“I cannot believe it.”\n“The facts, my dear sir, are against you. I have examined the snow in the garden, and I have seen the marks of her feet going to and from the dressing-room window. There is a small window there which opens on to the stable lane. She has been in the habit of meeting someone there.”\n“Meeting someone! Who?”\n“Sir George Burnwell.”\nThe banker groaned. “Oh, the villain! The villain! I know the man. He is a ruined gambler and a profligate. He was introduced to us by Arthur, who thought he was a friend. He has been here several times. I never liked him.”\n“I have heard of him,” said Holmes. “He is a dangerous man. He has been the ruin of many a woman. Your niece, I am sorry to say, has fallen under his influence. She is a young and inexperienced girl, and he has played upon her feelings. He has persuaded her to help him in this matter.”\n“To help him to rob me?”\n“Yes, to rob you. She told him where the coronet was, and she arranged to meet him at the window. She slipped down after you were in bed, and she opened the window. He was waiting outside. He has been waiting there for some time, for I have seen the marks of his feet in the snow. They are deep and clear.”\n“And then?”\n“Then she told him about the coronet, and he persuaded her to hand it out to him. She was about to do so when she heard you coming downstairs. She quickly closed the window and ran back to her room. She met you in the passage, and she pretended to be surprised at seeing you. She asked you what was the matter, and she tried to distract your attention by telling you about Lucy and her wooden-legged lover.”\n“My God! My God! It is all clear now. But Arthur! What about Arthur?”\n“Arthur was awake. He had been unable to sleep on account of his debts. He heard his cousin slip out of her room, and he heard her go downstairs. He was curious, and he followed her. He saw her go into the dressing-room, and he saw her come out with the coronet in her hand. He saw her go to the window and open it. He saw her pass the coronet out to someone outside. He was so thunderstruck at the sight that he could not move for a moment. Then, fearing to expose her, he waited until she had gone back to her room. He then rushed down himself, and he found that the person in the garden had gone.

He was a foolish lad, but a brave one.”\n“And the thief?”\n“Was Sir George Burnwell. I have traced him. I have seen him.

His face, so recently haggard with despair, was now alight with profound relief. \"Mr. Holmes,\" he continued, his voice trembling slightly with emotion, \"I cannot adequately express my gratitude. You have not only restored my honour and my family's good name but have also averted a catastrophe that would have shaken the very foundations of public trust. The recovery of the coronet, intact and gleaming, feels like a miracle. To think that I almost accused my own son! The weight that has been lifted from my soul is immeasurable. You are indeed a remarkable man, a true benefactor to the nation.\" Holmes merely inclined his head, his eyes twinkling with quiet satisfaction. Watson felt a surge of pride for his friend's extraordinary intellect and dedication. The morning sun, now streaming through the window, seemed to reflect the renewed hope in the room."

It is pleasant to me to observe, Watson, that you have so far grasped this truth that in these little records of our cases which you have been good enough to draw up, and, I am bound to say, occasionally to embellish, you have given prominence not so much to the many causes célèbres and sensational trials in which I have figured but rather to those incidents which may have been trivial in themselves, but which have given room for those faculties of deduction and of logical synthesis which I have made my special province.”\n“And yet,” said I, smiling, “I cannot quite hold myself absolved from the charge of sensationalism which has been urged against my records.”\n“You have erred, perhaps,” he observed, taking up a glowing cinder with the tongs and lighting with it the long cherry-wood pipe which was wont to replace his clay when he was in a disputatious rather than a meditative mood—“you have erred perhaps in attempting to put colour and life into each of your statements instead of confining yourself to the task of placing upon record that severe reasoning from cause to effect which is really the only notable feature about the thing.”\n“It seems to me that I have done you full justice in the matter,” I remarked with some coldness, for I was repelled by the egotism which I had more than once observed to be a strong factor in my friend’s singular character.\n“No, it is not selfishness or conceit,” said he, answering, as was his wont, my thoughts rather than my words. “If I claim full justice for my art, it is because it is an impersonal thing—a thing beyond myself. Crime is common. Logic is rare. Therefore it is upon the logic rather than upon the crime that you should dwell. You have degraded what should have been a course of lectures into a series of tales.”\nIt was a cold morning of the early spring, and we sat after breakfast on either side of a cheery fire in the old room at Baker Street. A thick fog rolled down between the lines of dun-coloured houses, and the opposing windows loomed like dark, shapeless blurs through the heavy yellow wreaths. Our gas was lit and shone on the white cloth and glimmer of china and metal, for the table had not been cleared yet. Sherlock Holmes had been silent all the morning, dipping continuously into the advertisement columns of a succession of papers until at last, having apparently given up his search, he had emerged in no very sweet temper to lecture me upon my literary shortcomings.",

But in avoiding the sensational, I fear that you may have bordered on the trivial.”\n“The end may have been so,” I answered, “but the methods I hold to have been novel and of interest.”\n“Pshaw, my dear fellow, what do the public, the great unobservant public, who could hardly tell a weaver by his tooth or a compositor by his left thumb, care about the finer shades of analysis and deduction! But, indeed, if you are trivial, I cannot blame you, for the days of the great cases are past. Man, or at least criminal man, has lost all enterprise and originality.

Yours faithfully,\n“VIOLET HUNTER.”\n“Do you know the young lady?” I asked.\n“Not I.”\n“It is half-past ten now.”\n“Yes, and I have no doubt that is her ring.”\n“It may turn out to be of more interest than you think. You remember that the affair of the blue carbuncle, which appeared to be a mere whim at first, developed into a serious investigation. It may be so in this case, also.”\n“Well, let us hope so. But our doubts will very soon be solved, for here, unless I am much mistaken, is the person in question.”\nAs he spoke the door opened and a young lady entered the room.",

They are concerned, rather, with the odd, the bizarre, the tragicomic aspects of human existence that seldom find their way into the police gazette. Consider, for instance, the singular affair of the red-headed League, a matter of elaborate deception and attempted fraud, certainly, but hardly a capital offence. Or the case of the man with the twisted lip, a question of disguise and begging, a moral failing perhaps, but not a felony that would bring him before the assizes. Then there are the purely domestic tragedies, the strange disappearances rooted in family secrets, the matters of inheritance complicated by peculiar wills, the instances of blackmail that never reach the ears of the official force because the victims prefer silence to scandal. These are the problems that come to me, Watson, not because they are crimes in the eyes of the law, but because they are problems in the eyes of the individual who is perplexed, distressed, or ruined by them. They represent the infinite variety of human motive and circumstance, the subtle shades of wrong-doing and misfortune that lie outside the blunt categories of the criminal code. You have, in your chronicles, captured this broader spectrum. You have shown that the work of detection is not merely the pursuit of felons, but the unraveling of knots in the fabric of life, the restoration of balance where it has been disturbed, the bringing of light into dark and confused corners, regardless of whether a policeman would take cognisance of the matter. It is this human element, this insight into the complexities and eccentricities of our fellow men, that gives your narratives their peculiar value, quite apart from the intellectual exercise of the puzzle itself. You have documented the strange, the sad, and the merely unusual, providing a truer picture of the world as it is experienced by those who find themselves caught in its less conventional snares.”"

I shall be happy to do anything that I can to serve you.”\nI could see that Holmes was favourably impressed by the manner and speech of his new client. He looked her over in his searching fashion, and then composed himself, with his lids drooping and his finger-tips together, to listen to her story.\n“I have been a governess for five years,” said she, “in the family of Colonel Spence Munro, but two months ago the colonel received an appointment at Halifax, in Nova Scotia, and took his children over to America with him, so that I found myself without a situation. I advertised, and I answered advertisements, but without success. At last the little money which I had saved began to run short, and I was at my wit’s end as to what I should do.\n“There is a well-known agency for governesses in the West End called Westaway’s, and there I used to call about once a week in order to see whether anything had turned up which might suit me. Westaway was the name of the founder of the business, but it is really managed by Miss Stoper. She sits in her own little office, and the ladies who are seeking employment wait in an anteroom, and are then shown in one by one, when she consults her ledgers and sees whether she has anything which would suit them.\n“Well, when I called last week I was shown into the little office as usual, but I found that Miss Stoper was not alone. A prodigiously stout man with a very smiling face and a great heavy chin which rolled down in fold upon fold over his throat sat at her elbow with a pair of glasses on his nose, looking very earnestly at the ladies who entered. As I came in he gave quite a jump in his chair and turned quickly to Miss Stoper.\n“‘That will do,’ said he; ‘I could not ask for anything better. Capital! capital!’ He seemed quite enthusiastic and rubbed his hands together in the most genial fashion. He was such a comfortable-looking man that it was quite a pleasure to look at him.\n“‘You are looking for a situation, miss?’ he asked.\n“‘Yes, sir.’\n“‘As governess?’\n“‘Yes, sir.’\n“‘And what salary do you ask?’\n“‘I had £ 4 a month in my last place with Colonel Spence Munro.’\n“‘Oh, tut, tut! sweating—rank sweating!’ he cried, throwing his fat hands out into the air like a man who is in a boiling passion. ‘How could anyone offer so pitiful a sum to a lady with such attractions and accomplishments?’\n“‘My accomplishments, sir, may be less than you imagine,’ said I. ‘A little French, a little German, music, and drawing—’\n“‘Tut, tut!’ he cried. ‘This is all quite beside the question. The point is, have you or have you not the bearing and deportment of a lady? There it is in a nutshell. If you have not, you are not fitted for the rearing of a child who may some day play a considerable part in the history of the country. But if you have, why, then, how could any gentleman ask you to condescend to accept anything under the three figures? Your salary with me, madam, would commence at £ 100 a year.’\n“You may imagine, Mr. Holmes, that to me, destitute as I was, such an offer seemed almost too good to be true. The gentleman, however, seeing perhaps the look of incredulity upon my face, opened a pocket-book and took out a note.\n“‘It is also my custom,’ said he, smiling in the most pleasant fashion until his eyes were just two little shining slits amid the white creases of his face, ‘to advance to my young ladies half their salary beforehand, so that they may meet any little expenses of their journey and their wardrobe.’\n“It seemed to me that I had never met so fascinating and so thoughtful a man. As I was already in debt to my tradesmen, the advance was a great convenience, and yet there was something unnatural about the whole transaction which made me wish to know a little more before I quite committed myself.\n“‘May I ask where you live, sir?’ said I.\n“‘Hampshire. Charming rural place. The Copper Beeches, five miles on the far side of Winchester. It is the most lovely country, my dear young lady, and the dearest old country-house.’\n“‘And my duties, sir? I should be glad to know what they would be.’\n“‘One child—one dear little romper just six years old. Oh, if you could see him killing cockroaches with a slipper! Smack! smack! smack! Three gone before you could wink!’ He leaned back in his chair and laughed his eyes into his head again.\n“I was a little startled at the nature of the child’s amusement, but the father’s laughter made me think that perhaps he was joking.\n“‘My sole duties, then,’ I asked, ‘are to take charge of a single child?’\n“‘No, no, not the sole, not the sole, my dear young lady,’ he cried. ‘Your duty would be, as I am sure your good sense would suggest, to obey any little commands my wife might give, provided always that they were such commands as a lady might with propriety obey. You see no difficulty, heh?’\n“‘I should be happy to make myself useful.’\n“‘Quite so. In dress now, for example. We are faddy people, you know—faddy but kind-hearted. If you were asked to wear any dress which we might give you, you would not object to our little whim. Heh?’\n“‘No,’ said I, considerably astonished at his words.\n“‘Or to sit here, or sit there, that would not be offensive to you?’\n“‘Oh, no.’\n“‘Or to cut your hair quite short before you come to us?’\n“I could hardly believe my ears. As you may observe, Mr. Holmes, my hair is somewhat luxuriant, and of a rather peculiar tint of chestnut. It has been considered artistic. I could not dream of sacrificing it in this offhand fashion.\n“‘I am afraid that that is quite impossible,’ said I. He had been watching me eagerly out of his small eyes, and I could see a shadow pass over his face as I spoke.\n“‘I am afraid that it is quite essential,’ said he. ‘It is a little fancy of my wife’s, and ladies’ fancies, you know, madam, ladies’ fancies must be consulted. And so you won’t cut your hair?’\n“‘No, sir, I really could not,’ I answered firmly.\n“‘Ah, very well; then that quite settles the matter. It is a pity, because in other respects you would really have done very nicely. In that case, Miss Stoper, I had best inspect a few more of your young ladies.’\n“The manageress had sat all this while busy with her papers without a word to either of us, but she glanced at me now with so much annoyance upon her face that I could not help suspecting that she had lost a handsome commission through my refusal.\n“‘Do you desire your name to be kept upon the books?’ she asked.\n“‘If you please, Miss Stoper.’\n“‘Well, really, it seems rather useless, since you refuse the most excellent offers in this fashion,’ said she sharply. ‘You can hardly expect us to exert ourselves to find another such opening for you. Good-day to you, Miss Hunter.’ She struck a gong upon the table, and I was shown out by the page.",

The name was Mr. Jephro Rucastle, of The Copper Beeches, near Winchester. I saw Mr. Rucastle here in town, and he seemed at once to take a fancy to me. I thought that he was a very genial and kindly man, but exceedingly stout and florid in the face. He actually laughed when he saw me, and said: ‘Well, if you have come farther, you might have fared worse,’ and then he asked me a lot of questions about my history and my talents, and he did it all in such a kindly way that I soon felt quite at home with him.\n\n“‘You can paint, can you not?’ asked he.\n\n“‘Oh, yes,’ said I. ‘I am fond of painting.’\n\n“‘But you can do something else too,’ said he. ‘You can teach the child to observe.’\n\n“‘I hope so,’ I answered.\n\n“‘Well, I think you will suit me,’ said he. ‘I hope so. But we will not decide it quite at once.’ He then told me that he was a widower with one child—a lad of six. There were no other children. The place was a fine old country-house, and he was himself a retired manufacturer, and very well-to-do. There were many servants, and they all lived very comfortably. The only thing that was against it was that the place was lonely, and that from the windows one could see nothing but the tops of the trees.\n\n“‘I was not much afraid of loneliness, however, and asked if I could see the child. He said that his wife was away from home, and that he did not like to show the child to strangers. He said that he was sure that I should like the place, and that he would give me a salary of a hundred pounds a year, which was a very large sum, as you know, Mr. Holmes, for a governess. I had never had more than forty pounds a year in my life, and I was so glad that I could hardly speak. I asked him if there were any other duties, and he said that there were none, except that I should have to look after the child, and that I should have to obey his wife’s little commands. He said that his wife was a very peculiar woman, and that she had some strange fancies, and that I should have to humour her in them. He said that she liked to have everything her own way, and that I should have to do whatever she told me. He said that she might ask me to wear certain dresses, or to sit in certain places, or to do other things that might seem strange to me, but that I must do them all the same. He said that she was a very kind lady, but that she had some strange fancies, and that I must not cross her in them.\n\n“‘He then told me that he had one other condition, and that was that I should cut off my hair. I was very much surprised at this, and I told him that I did not like to do it. I have always been proud of my hair, for it is very long and thick, and of a beautiful chestnut colour. I told him that I did not like to cut it off, and that I would rather not take the place if I had to do it. He said that it was a very important matter, and that his wife had set her heart upon it. He said that she had a fancy for having a governess with short hair, and that she would not be satisfied unless I did it. I told him that I would rather not do it, and that I would rather lose the place. He said that he was very sorry, but that he could not help it, and that if I would not cut off my hair, he could not engage me. I was very much disappointed, but I would not give in, and I told him that I would rather not take the place. He said that he was very sorry, and that he hoped that I would find a better place, and then he shook hands with me and went away.\n\n“Well, Mr. Holmes, you may think that I was very foolish to refuse such a good offer, but I assure you that I could not help it. I have always been proud of my hair, and I could not bear to cut it off. I am sure that you will understand me, for you are a man who has a sense of beauty.

After all, if these people had strange fads and expected obedience on the most extraordinary matters, they were at least ready to pay for their eccentricity. Very few governesses in England are getting £ 100 a year. Besides, what use was my hair to me? Many people are improved by wearing it short and perhaps I should be among the number. Next day I was inclined to think that I had made a mistake, and by the day after I was sure of it. I had almost overcome my pride so far as to go back to the agency and inquire whether the place was still open when I received this letter from the gentleman himself. I have it here and I will read it to you:\n“‘The Copper Beeches, near Winchester.\n“‘DEAR MISS HUNTER,—Miss Stoper has very kindly given me your address, and I write from here to ask you whether you have reconsidered your decision. My wife is very anxious that you should come, for she has been much attracted by my description of you. We are willing to give £ 30 a quarter, or £ 120 a year, so as to recompense you for any little inconvenience which our fads may cause you. They are not very exacting, after all. My wife is fond of a particular shade of electric blue and would like you to wear such a dress indoors in the morning. You need not, however, go to the expense of purchasing one, as we have one belonging to my dear daughter Alice (now in Philadelphia), which would, I should think, fit you very well. Then, as to sitting here or there, or amusing yourself in any manner indicated, that need cause you no inconvenience. As regards your hair, it is no doubt a pity, especially as I could not help remarking its beauty during our short interview, but I am afraid that I must remain firm upon this point, and I only hope that the increased salary may recompense you for the loss. Your duties, as far as the child is concerned, are very light. Now do try to come, and I shall meet you with the dog-cart at Winchester. Let me know your train. Yours faithfully,\n“‘JEPHRO RUCASTLE.’\n“That is the letter which I have just received, Mr. Holmes, and my mind is made up that I will accept it. I thought, however, that before taking the final step I should like to submit the whole matter to your consideration.”\n“Well, Miss Hunter, if your mind is made up, that settles the question,” said Holmes, smiling.\n“But you would not advise me to refuse?”\n“I confess that it is not the situation which I should like to see a sister of mine apply for.”\n“What is the meaning of it all, Mr. Holmes?”\n“Ah, I have no data. I cannot tell. Perhaps you have yourself formed some opinion?”\n“Well, there seems to me to be only one possible solution. Mr. Rucastle seemed to be a very kind, good-natured man. Is it not possible that his wife is a lunatic, that he desires to keep the matter quiet for fear she should be taken to an asylum, and that he humours her fancies in every way in order to prevent an outbreak?”\n“That is a possible solution—in fact, as matters stand, it is the most probable one. But in any case it does not seem to be a nice household for a young lady.”\n“But the money, Mr. Holmes, the money!”\n“Well, yes, of course the pay is good—too good. That is what makes me uneasy. Why should they give you £ 120 a year, when they could have their pick for £ 40? There must be some strong reason behind.”\n“I thought that if I told you the circumstances you would understand afterwards if I wanted your help. I should feel so much stronger if I felt that you were at the back of me.”\n“Oh, you may carry that feeling away with you. I assure you that your little problem promises to be the most interesting which has come my way for some months. There is something distinctly novel about some of the features. If you should find yourself in doubt or in danger—”\n“Danger! What danger do you foresee?”\nHolmes shook his head gravely. “It would cease to be a danger if we could define it,” said he. “But at any time, day or night, a telegram would bring me down to your help.”\n“That is enough.” She rose briskly from her chair with the anxiety all swept from her face. “I shall go down to Hampshire quite easy in my mind now. I shall write to Mr. Rucastle at once, sacrifice my poor hair to-night, and start for Winchester to-morrow.” With a few grateful words to Holmes she bade us both good-night and bustled off upon her way.\n“At least,” said I as we heard her quick, firm steps descending the stairs, “she seems to be a young lady who is very well able to take care of herself.”\n“And she would need to be,” said Holmes gravely. “I am much mistaken if we do not hear from her before many days are past.”",

If you can come at once, we shall be very glad to receive you, and you will find all arrangements very comfortable. An answer by return will oblige.\n\n“Yours faithfully,\n“JEPHRO RUCASTLE.”\n\n“Hum! That’s terse and to the point,” said Holmes. “Apparently his wife has weakened.”\n\n“Yes, I think she has, and after I had slept over it I felt that I really could not afford to refuse it. So I wrote the acceptance yesterday, and told him that I should be glad to come at once. Then this morning I received this second letter, which he wrote after he had had my note.”\n\n“Hello! Here we are!” said Holmes, critically. “This is certainly rather novel.”\n\nIt proved to be a hurrying note, written in pencil upon half a sheet of notepaper, and dated in that morning’s post. “Please ignore my last letter,” it said. “My wife has since that been down with a slight attack of illness, and I have not been able to consult her. She has now revived, and begs me to say that she confirms in every way my offer of yesterday, and adds that she is quite impatient to see you. She begs, however, that when you come, you will be so kind as to cut your hair of the length that you were thinking of, and to wear the dress which I described. Mr. Rucastle presents his compliments, and hopes that you are not inconvenienced by the delay.”\n\n“That seems all right, except the cutting,” said I.\n\n“Why, I am not so sure about it,” said Miss Hunter. “I have arranged to go, and to go at once, but if you think that there is danger I am free to admit that the idea makes me nervous.”\n\n“I can see no danger yet,” said Holmes. “It would be rash to say more. I confess that the note is very extraordinary, and I am inclined to think that it may be the prelude to something queer. But what can it be? You say that you are quite alone and friendless, and that your salary will be a hundred a year.”\n\n“Not a hundred, Mr. Holmes. It is a hundred and twenty—thirty pounds a quarter.”\n\n“And the duties, you say, are light?”\n\n“Principally to be companion to the child, and to sit in a certain place when she is there.”\n\n“And the cutting of the hair and the wearing of the dress are the only conditions?”\n\n“They are the only ones which he mentioned in the first interview, and again repeated in his letters.”\n\n“I hardly know what to advise you to do,” said Holmes, shrugging his shoulders. “It is a very extraordinary request, and whether you can comply with it is a matter for your own conscience and good sense. Well, at least I have the satisfaction of knowing that you are going to a £120 a year situation, and that you are not accepting a hundred as you said at first. You were quite right to insist upon that point, Miss Hunter.”\n\n“Indeed, I feel that I have done a rather bold thing in accepting a position which is so entirely removed from all my previous experience. But you see, Mr. Holmes, when you have hunted about for twelve months and found nothing, you are at last willing to take anything that comes your way, however questionable it may be. But I thought that you would like to hear the details of it, since you were interested in the matter when I first spoke to you.”\n\n“Certainly. I should feel very much concerned if you were to come to any harm. I will turn the thing over in my mind, and let you know if I come to any conclusion. Don’t hesitate to wire to me at once if you find anything amiss or should become uncomfortable.”\n\n“That I will do, Mr. Holmes.”\n\n“And now, good-bye, and good luck!” said Holmes. “I fear that you will find it a queer place, but at least you are going to a good salary.”\n\nShe half rose, but sat down again.\n\n“I am not quite easy about it, Mr. Holmes,” she said. “I should be very glad if you would give me your real opinion as to what you think is the meaning of it.”\n\n“Well, my dear madam, I have said all that I can say until I have more data. I confess that your story is, as far as I know, absolutely unique. It is true that there are some very eccentric people in the world. I have had dealings with several, but your experience has been, as far as I can recall, more strange than any that I have ever listened to. I cannot at the moment form any definite opinion about it. Perhaps you yourself have some theory which would fit the facts.”\n\n“It has occurred to me,” she said, “that the real object may be to do Mrs. Rucastle good. I think that her husband may have become alarmed at her fancies, and that he desires to humour her, lest she should do something which he should regret, or lest she should be confined. She had a breakdown some little time ago, and was placed in a private asylum. It is quite possible that her husband prefers to have a stranger about the house than a professional nurse, and that for some reason she takes a fancy to my appearance—that is to say, to my hair and my dress. You know that often happens with insane people. They take violent likes and dislikes without any reason. If so, then the conditions are reasonable enough.”\n\n“Well, at least it is a possible theory,” said Holmes. “The danger would be if this poor lady should take a violent dislike to you, and should attack you in one of her fits. It is true",

                "text": "Well, Mr. Holmes, when I got back to my lodgings and found little enough in the cupboard, and two or three bills upon the table, I began to ask myself whether I had not done a very foolish thing. After all, if these people are kind and pleasant, I might have tolerated their queer ways for a few months, and pulled myself together a little. Then, just as I was fretting over my folly, I fell into a trap, Mr. Holmes, which proved too strong for my resolution. I received this letter, and here it is.”\n\nShe handed over a note to Holmes, and he read it aloud to me. It was dated from “The Copper Beeches, near Winchester,” and ran thus:\n\n“MADAM,—Mrs. Rucastle is so pleased at the description which I have given her of you, that she begs me to write and say that you will suit us both. If you can come at once, we shall be very glad to receive you, and you will find all arrangements very comfortable. An answer by return will oblige.\n\n“Yours faithfully,\n“JEPHRO RUCASTLE.”\n\n“Hum! That’s terse and to the point,” said Holmes. “Apparently his wife has weakened.”\n\n“Yes, I think she has, and after I had slept over it I felt that I really could not afford to refuse it. So I wrote the acceptance yesterday, and told him that I should be glad to come at once. Then this morning I received this second letter, which he wrote after he had had my note.”\n\n“Hello! Here we are!” said Holmes, critically. “This is certainly rather novel.”\n\nIt proved to be a hurrying note, written in pencil upon half a sheet of notepaper, and dated in that morning’s post. “Please ignore my last letter,” it said. “My wife has since that been down with a slight attack of illness, and I have not been able to consult her. She has now revived, and begs me to say that she confirms in every way my offer of yesterday, and adds that she is quite impatient to see you. She begs, however, that when you come, you will be so kind as to cut your hair of the length that you were thinking of, and to wear the dress which I described. Mr. Rucastle presents his compliments, and hopes that you are not inconvenienced by the delay.”\n\n“That seems all right, except the cutting,” said I.\n\n“Why, I am not so sure about it,” said Miss Hunter. “I have arranged to go, and to go at once, but if you think that there is danger I am free to admit that the idea makes me nervous.”\n\n“I can see no danger yet,” said Holmes. “It would be rash to say more. I confess that the note is very extraordinary, and I am inclined to think that it may be the prelude to something queer. But what can it be? You say that you are quite alone and friendless, and that your salary will be a hundred a year.”\n\n“Not a hundred, Mr. Holmes.

          "text_segment": "It was not very long before my friend’s prediction was fulfilled. A fortnight went by, during which I frequently found my thoughts turning in her direction and wondering what strange side-alley of human experience this lonely woman had strayed into. The unusual salary, the curious conditions, the light duties, all pointed to something abnormal, though whether a fad or a plot, or whether the man were a philanthropist or a villain, it was quite beyond my powers to determine. As to Holmes, I observed that he sat frequently for half an hour on end, with knitted brows and an abstracted air, but he swept the matter away with a wave of his hand when I mentioned it. “Data! data! data!” he cried impatiently. “I can’t make bricks without clay.” And yet he would always wind up by muttering that no sister of his should ever have accepted such a situation.\nThe telegram which we eventually received came late one night just as I was thinking of turning in and Holmes was settling down to one of those all-night chemical researches which he frequently indulged in, when I would leave him stooping over a retort and a test-tube at night and find him in the same position when I came down to breakfast in the morning. He opened the yellow envelope, and then, glancing at the message, threw it across to me.\n“Just look up the trains in Bradshaw,” said he, and turned back to his chemical studies.\nThe summons was a brief and urgent one.\n“Please be at the Black Swan Hotel at Winchester at midday to-morrow,” it said. “Do come! I am at my wit’s end.\n“HUNTER.”\n“Will you come with me?” asked Holmes, glancing up.\n“I should wish to.”\n“Just look it up, then.”\n“There is a train at half-past nine,” said I, glancing over my Bradshaw. “It is due at Winchester at 11:30.”\n“That will do very nicely. Then perhaps I had better postpone my analysis of the acetones, as we may need to be at our best in the morning.”\nBy eleven o’clock the next day we were well upon our way to the old English capital. Holmes had been buried in the morning papers all the way down, but after we had passed the Hampshire border he threw them down and began to admire the scenery. It was an ideal spring day, a light blue sky, flecked with little fleecy white clouds drifting across from west to east. The sun was shining very brightly, and yet there was an exhilarating nip in the air, which set an edge to a man’s energy. All over the countryside, away to the rolling hills around Aldershot, the little red and grey roofs of the farm-steadings peeped out from amid the light green of the new foliage.\n“Are they not fresh and beautiful?” I cried with all the enthusiasm of a man fresh from the fogs of Baker Street.\nBut Holmes shook his head gravely.\n“Do you know, Watson,” said he, “that it is one of the curses of a mind with a turn like mine that I must look at everything with reference to my own special subject. You look at these scattered houses, and you are impressed by their beauty. I look at them, and the only thought which comes to me is a feeling of their isolation and of the impunity with which crime may be committed there.”\n“Good heavens!” I cried. “Who would associate crime with these dear old homesteads?”\n“They always fill me with a certain horror. It is my belief, Watson, founded upon my experience, that the lowest and vilest alleys in London do not present a more dreadful record of sin than does the smiling and beautiful countryside.”\n“You horrify me!”\n“But the reason is very obvious. The pressure of public opinion can do in the town what the law cannot accomplish. There is no lane so vile that the scream of a tortured child, or the thud of a drunkard’s blow, does not beget sympathy and indignation among the neighbours, and then the whole machinery of justice is ever so close that a word of complaint can set it going, and there is but a step between the crime and the dock. But look at these lonely houses, each in its own fields, filled for the most part with poor ignorant folk who know little of the law. Think of the deeds of hellish cruelty, the hidden wickedness which may go on, year in, year out, in such places, and none the wiser. Had this lady who appeals to us for help gone to live in Winchester, I should never have had a fear for her. It is the five miles of country which makes the danger. Still, it is clear that she is not personally threatened.”\n“No. If she can come to Winchester to meet us she can get away.”\n“Quite so. She has her freedom.”\n“What can be the matter, then? Can you suggest no explanation?”\n“I have devised seven separate explanations, each of which would cover the facts as far as we know them. But which of these is correct can only be determined by the fresh information which we shall no doubt find waiting for us. Well, there is the tower of the cathedral, and we shall soon learn all that Miss Hunter has to tell.”",

A fortnight had passed, during which I had heard nothing of my unfortunate client, and had vainly endeavoured to convince myself that she had found her position more bearable than she had anticipated. I was sitting one evening in my armchair in a reverie, with my feet upon the fender, when my door opened and Holmes stepped in. Before I had time to ask the result of his inquiries, he answered with a gesture which showed that he had none. “Well, I confess that I am as far off as ever.” “Is it possible?” I cried. “You can surely not have failed, then, to discover the address of the young lady’s employer?” “Certainly not. I have it in my pocket. But I have a great deal more than that. I have been at infinite pains, and I believe that I have secured every possible fact which has any bearing upon the matter. But the difficulty is that we have not yet got a clue which will enable us to connect our facts with the great problem which they are intended to solve. Until we have that clue we are foundering about in the dark with all this material. We know, for example, that though Miss Hunter has a smooth face and blonde hair, she has very dark eyebrows and eyelashes. We know that she was born in eighteen fifty-six. We know that she can do shorthand and typewriter. We know that she writes a good hand, and that she has a most amiable disposition. But what use is it?” “It is true,” said I. “We know nothing about the people she has gone to.” “Ah, that is just the gap which I have tried in vain to fill,” cried Holmes. “It is true that I have caused inquiries to be made as to the owners of The Copper Beeches, but I find that the place has only been purchased within the last few years, and that the former proprietor was a retired manufacturer of the name of Rucastle. It is an old house, and stands upon ten acres of parkland. Those are all the facts which I have been able to obtain, save that he is a man of fifty, very wealthy, and of an amiable disposition. Pray what use can I make of them?” “Beyond stating that her employer seems a desirable person, I confess that I can see none.” “It is provoking, Watson, very provoking,” said Holmes, ramming his hands into his pockets and pacing petulantly up and down the room. “We are facing a deliberate conspiracy to cut this girl off from all the world. That is clear to me. And her own acquiescence in it is equally clear. Yet, complaisant as she is, she has taken that precaution which I suggested to her, and only communicates with us through a single post-office box. You see how difficult it is. If this man were a villain, it would be simple; but though he is clearly doing something unfair—” “Why do you say so?” “Because he offered Miss Hunter a salary of one hundred pounds a year, and she only gets twenty. Because he made her cut off her hair. Because he insisted upon her wearing that ridiculous blue dress. They are all distinctive and odd in themselves. What then, when you put them all together? It points, I consider, to some deep secret. The lady’s disinclination to explain them, and her readiness to comply with conditions so strange, furnish us with as good a proof as we can wish that she is herself not only aware of the secret, but is interested in keeping it. I can see difficulties, Watson, in the way of our solving this problem, and I look upon it as one of the most singular which I have ever been called upon to face.” Holmes walked up and down for some time with his brows knitted and his head sunk upon his breast, his hands still thrust into his trousers pockets. Suddenly he raised his head with the air of a man who has come to a definite conclusion. “Perhaps, after all, the best system is to work backwards,” said he. “It is at least worth trying. Let us suppose that Miss Hunter has agreed to some curious and inexplicable compact, which is against her own interests, and against her own conscience. What would she do then? She would fly to someone for advice and assistance. To whom would she fly? To those whom she knew to be intelligent, discreet, and reliable; those who would not divulge her secrets, and yet would not shrink from taking action on her behalf. In short, she would fly to us.” “Then,” said I, “you think that this odd conduct, so unlike her usual self, means that she is conscious of some guilty knowledge.” “Well, Watson,” said Holmes, “the lady may be putting us in possession of the facts which may point to a guilty knowledge, but the guilty knowledge is, I believe, her employer’s and not hers. On the contrary, I think that she is a very innocent and ill-used young lady. I consider that it is of the utmost importance that a fitting recognition should be given to her courage and discretion. She would not tell us what the exact nature of her position was, and it is evident that she was loyal to her employer in spite of her discontent. However, it is my opinion that, in accepting so large a salary for so trifling an occupation, she had some idea that there were other duties which would prove more exacting. Your words, Watson, have given me a fresh starting-point. I will make some fresh inquiries. It is possible that we may hear from Miss Hunter at any moment.” We did hear from Miss Hunter at the very next moment, for just as Holmes had finished his sentence there came a tap at the door, and a telegram was handed in. Holmes tore it open, and burst out laughing. “Well, Watson, what do you think of this? Just as I was saying that we were likely to hear from her. Here she is, right on time.” The telegram was dated from Winchester, and ran in this way: “Please be at the Black Swan Hotel, Winchester, at midday to-morrow. Have important fresh facts. Am at my wit’s end. VIOLET HUNTER.” “Hum!” said Holmes, “this promises to be interesting. This woman sends for help, and yet is so discreet as to keep us in ignorance of the precise nature of her trouble. She can write to us, but she will not tell us what it is. There is some reason for this. Can you suggest any?” “It is possible that she is afraid to write, lest her letter should be intercepted.” “Oh, that is it,” said Holmes, “do you think so? Well, it is possible. If she has to be so discreet, the matter must be serious. Come, Watson, we will go. How about",

          "text_segment": "The Black Swan is an inn of repute in the High Street, at no distance from the station, and there we found the young lady waiting for us. She had engaged a sitting-room, and our lunch awaited us upon the table.\n“I am so delighted that you have come,” she said earnestly. “It is so very kind of you both; but indeed I do not know what I should do. Your advice will be altogether invaluable to me.”\n“Pray tell us what has happened to you.”\n“I will do so, and I must be quick, for I have promised Mr. Rucastle to be back before three. I got his leave to come into town this morning, though he little knew for what purpose.”\n“Let us have everything in its due order.” Holmes thrust his long thin legs out towards the fire and composed himself to listen.\n“In the first place, I may say that I have met, on the whole, with no actual ill-treatment from Mr. and Mrs. Rucastle. It is only fair to them to say that. But I cannot understand them, and I am not easy in my mind about them.”\n“What can you not understand?”\n“Their reasons for their conduct. But you shall have it all just as it occurred. When I came down, Mr. Rucastle met me here and drove me in his dog-cart to the Copper Beeches. It is, as he said, beautifully situated, but it is not beautiful in itself, for it is a large square block of a house, whitewashed, but all stained and streaked with damp and bad weather. There are grounds round it, woods on three sides, and on the fourth a field which slopes down to the Southampton high road, which curves past about a hundred yards from the front door. This ground in front belongs to the house, but the woods all round are part of Lord Southerton’s preserves. A clump of copper beeches immediately in front of the hall door has given its name to the place.\n“I was driven over by my employer, who was as amiable as ever, and was introduced by him that evening to his wife and the child. There was no truth, Mr. Holmes, in the conjecture which seemed to us to be probable in your rooms at Baker Street. Mrs. Rucastle is not mad. I found her to be a silent, pale-faced woman, much younger than her husband, not more than thirty, I should think, while he can hardly be less than forty-five. From their conversation I have gathered that they have been married about seven years, that he was a widower, and that his only child by the first wife was the daughter who has gone to Philadelphia. Mr. Rucastle told me in private that the reason why she had left them was that she had an unreasoning aversion to her stepmother. As the daughter could not have been less than twenty, I can quite imagine that her position must have been uncomfortable with her father’s young wife.\n“Mrs. Rucastle seemed to me to be colourless in mind as well as in feature. She impressed me neither favourably nor the reverse. She was a nonentity. It was easy to see that she was passionately devoted both to her husband and to her little son. Her light grey eyes wandered continually from one to the other, noting every little want and forestalling it if possible. He was kind to her also in his bluff, boisterous fashion, and on the whole they seemed to be a happy couple. And yet she had some secret sorrow, this woman. She would often be lost in deep thought, with the saddest look upon her face. More than once I have surprised her in tears. I have thought sometimes that it was the disposition of her child which weighed upon her mind, for I have never met so utterly spoiled and so ill-natured a little creature. He is small for his age, with a head which is quite disproportionately large. His whole life appears to be spent in an alternation between savage fits of passion and gloomy intervals of sulking. Giving pain to any creature weaker than himself seems to be his one idea of amusement, and he shows quite remarkable talent in planning the capture of mice, little birds, and insects. But I would rather not talk about the creature, Mr. Holmes, and, indeed, he has little to do with my story.”\n“I am glad of all details,” remarked my friend, “whether they seem to you to be relevant or not.”\n“I shall try not to miss anything of importance. The one unpleasant thing about the house, which struck me at once, was the appearance and conduct of the servants. There are only two, a man and his wife. Toller, for that is his name, is a rough, uncouth man, with grizzled hair and whiskers, and a perpetual smell of drink. Twice since I have been with them he has been quite drunk, and yet Mr. Rucastle seemed to take no notice of it. His wife is a very tall and strong woman with a sour face, as silent as Mrs. Rucastle and much less amiable. They are a most unpleasant couple, but fortunately I spend most of my time in the nursery and my own room, which are next to each other in one corner of the building.\n“For two days after my arrival at the Copper Beeches my life was very quiet; on the third, Mrs. Rucastle came down just after breakfast and whispered something to her husband.\n“‘Oh, yes,’ said he, turning to me, ‘we are very much obliged to you, Miss Hunter, for falling in with our whims so far as to cut your hair. I assure you that it has not detracted in the tiniest iota from your appearance. We shall now see how the electric-blue dress will become you. You will find it laid out upon the bed in your room, and if you would be so good as to put it on we should both be extremely obliged.’\n“The dress which I found waiting for me was of a peculiar shade of blue. It was of excellent material, a sort of beige, but it bore unmistakable signs of having been worn before. It could not have been a better fit if I had been measured for it. Both Mr. and Mrs. Rucastle expressed a delight at the look of it, which seemed quite exaggerated in its vehemence. They were waiting for me in the drawing-room, which is a very large room, stretching along the entire front of the house, with three long windows reaching down to the floor. A chair had been placed close to the central window, with its back turned towards it. In this I was asked to sit, and then Mr. Rucastle, walking up and down on the other side of the room, began to tell me a series of the funniest stories that I have ever listened to. You cannot imagine how comical he was, and I laughed until I was quite weary. Mrs. Rucastle, however, who has evidently no sense of humour, never so much as smiled, but sat with her hands in her lap, and a sad, anxious look upon her face. After an hour or so, Mr. Rucastle suddenly remarked that it was time to commence the duties of the day, and that I might change my dress and go to little Edward in the nursery.\n“Two days later this same performance was gone through under exactly similar circumstances. Again I changed my dress, again I sat in the window, and again I laughed very heartily at the funny stories of which my employer had an immense répertoire, and which he told inimitably. Then he handed me a yellow-backed novel, and moving my chair a little sideways, that my own shadow might not fall upon the page, he begged me to read aloud to him. I read for about ten minutes, beginning in the heart of a chapter, and then suddenly, in the middle of a sentence, he ordered me to cease and to change my dress.\n“You can easily imagine, Mr. Holmes, how curious I became as to what the meaning of this extraordinary performance could possibly be. They were always very careful, I observed, to turn my face away from the window, so that I became consumed with the desire to see what was going on behind my back. At first it seemed to be impossible, but I soon devised a means. My hand-mirror had been broken, so a happy thought seized me, and I concealed a piece of the glass in my handkerchief. On the next occasion, in the midst of my laughter, I put my handkerchief up to my eyes, and was able with a little management to see all that there was behind me. I confess that I was disappointed. There was nothing. At least that was my first impression. At the second glance, however, I perceived that there was a man standing in the Southampton Road, a small bearded man in a grey suit, who seemed to be looking in my direction. The road is an important highway, and there are usually people there. This man, however, was leaning against the railings which bordered our field and was looking earnestly up. I lowered my handkerchief and glanced at Mrs. Rucastle to find her eyes fixed upon me with a most searching gaze. She said nothing, but I am convinced that she had divined that I had a mirror in my hand and had seen what was behind me. She rose at once.\n“‘Jephro,’ said she, ‘there is an impertinent fellow upon the road there who stares up at Miss Hunter.’\n“‘No friend of yours, Miss Hunter?’ he asked.\n“‘No, I know no one in these parts.’\n“‘Dear me! How very impertinent! Kindly turn round and motion to him to go away.’\n“‘Surely it would be better to take no notice.’\n“‘No, no, we should have him loitering here always. Kindly turn round and wave him away like that.’\n“I did as I was told, and at the same instant Mrs. Rucastle drew down the blind. That was a week ago, and from that time I have not sat again in the window, nor have I worn the blue dress, nor seen the man in the road.”\n“Pray continue,” said Holmes. “Your narrative promises to be a most interesting one.”\n“You will find it rather disconnected, I fear, and there may prove to be little relation between the different incidents of which I speak. On the very first day that I was at the Copper Beeches, Mr. Rucastle took me to a small outhouse which stands near the kitchen door. As we approached it I heard the sharp rattling of a chain, and the sound as of a large animal moving about.\n“‘Look in here!’ said Mr. Rucastle, showing me a slit between two planks. ‘Is he not a beauty?’\n“I looked through and was conscious of two glowing eyes, and of a vague figure huddled up in the darkness.\n“‘Don’t be frightened,’ said my employer, laughing at the start which I had given. ‘It’s only Carlo, my mastiff. I call him mine, but really old Toller, my groom, is the only man who can do anything with him. We feed him once a day, and not too much then, so that he is always as keen as mustard. Toller lets him loose every night, and God help the trespasser whom he lays his fangs upon. For goodness’ sake don’t you ever on any pretext set your foot over the threshold at night, for it’s as much as your life is worth.’\n“The warning was no idle one, for two nights later I happened to look out of my bedroom window about two o’clock in the morning. It was a beautiful moonlight night, and the lawn in front of the house was silvered over and almost as bright as day. I was standing, rapt in the peaceful beauty of the scene, when I was aware that something was moving under the shadow of the copper beeches. As it emerged into the moonshine I saw what it was. It was a giant dog, as large as a calf, tawny tinted, with hanging jowl, black muzzle, and huge projecting bones. It walked slowly across the lawn and vanished into the shadow upon the other side. That dreadful sentinel sent a chill to my heart which I do not think that any burglar could have done.\n“And now I have a very strange experience to tell you. I had, as you know, cut off my hair in London, and I had placed it in a great coil at the bottom of my trunk. One evening, after the child was in bed, I began to amuse myself by examining the furniture of my room and by rearranging my own little things. There was an old chest of drawers in the room, the two upper ones empty and open, the lower one locked. I had filled the first two with my linen, and as I had still much to pack away I was naturally annoyed at not having the use of the third drawer. It struck me that it might have been fastened by a mere oversight, so I took out my bunch of keys and tried to open it. The very first key fitted to perfection, and I drew the drawer open. There was only one thing in it, but I am sure that you would never guess what it was. It was my coil of hair.\n“I took it up and examined it. It was of the same peculiar tint, and the same thickness. But then the impossibility of the thing obtruded itself upon me. How could my hair have been locked in the drawer? With trembling hands I undid my trunk, turned out the contents, and drew from the bottom my own hair. I laid the two tresses together, and I assure you that they were identical. Was it not extraordinary? Puzzle as I would, I could make nothing at all of what it meant. I returned the strange hair to the drawer, and I said nothing of the matter to the Rucastles as I felt that I had put myself in the wrong by opening a drawer which they had locked.",

She had ordered lunch, and we were soon seated at a table with a substantial cold meat. “I am so glad that you have come,” she said, earnestly. “It is so very kind of you, but I feel as if I can hardly express my relief. You cannot imagine how I have been looking forward to you. There will be no difficulty about paying your expenses, I assure you. Mr. Rucastle has acted very handsomely in that matter. I thought it best that you should be paid at once, for you can hardly start upon your great undertaking without money.” “Quite so,” said Holmes. “And now, Miss Hunter, the sooner you tell us what you have to tell the better. That will just give us time to turn it over by three o’clock, when you must be off.” “I will tell you the whole story,” said our client. “You will judge if I have been indiscreet in coming to you and exposing myself to the censure of the gentleman who has entrusted me with this position. I have had a miserable time, Mr. Holmes. I can stand it no longer. I am going back to-day, but never again will I enter that door.” “I am sorry to hear you say so.” “It is only what I expected. You have not yet heard my story, Mr. Holmes. If you had, you would not wonder that I will not go back.” “Pray continue. I am all attention.” “Mr. Holmes, you can imagine how exasperated I was by the way in which I had been treated. I had never in my life been so insulted. I could not endure the thought of staying for another hour under that roof, and yet I had nowhere else to go. I was mad with rage, and I don’t know what I might have done if I had not suddenly thought of you. I remembered what you had said about coming to you if ever I should be in trouble, and I determined that I would do so. I packed my box, and I came straight to Winchester, leaving a note for Mr. Rucastle to say that I would not be back. I have no doubt that he will be very angry, but I don’t care. I have been so unhappy that I don’t mind what happens.” “That is all very well,” said Holmes, “but we must not be precipitate. Let us hear the facts of the case. I understand that you have not been ill-treated.” “Oh, no, sir. I am well fed and well housed. It is the living of the life that is so dreadful. You can’t imagine how dreadful it is.” “Perhaps I can, if you will tell me all about it.” “Well, sir, I will begin at the beginning. I told you about the house, Copper Beeches, did I not? It is a large, square country house, standing in a considerable park, and it is damp-stained and dingy, as I told you. But the park is a beautiful one, and there are some magnificent old trees in it, especially the copper beeches from which the place gets its name. The house stands in a hollow, and the ground slopes down to the road. There is a large field in front of the house, and beyond that is the road. The house is a very lonely one, and there are no neighbours near. The nearest village is about two miles away.” “And the family?” asked Holmes. “Mr. Rucastle is a man of about forty, I should say. He is a tall, fair man, with a red face and a bald head. He has a loud, booming voice, and he is always laughing. He is a very strange man, Mr. Holmes. I don’t know what to make of him. He is very kind to me in some ways, and in others he is very cruel. He is a very difficult man to understand.” “And Mrs. Rucastle?” “Mrs. Rucastle is a pale, silent woman, younger than her husband, but I should not think she is more than thirty. She is a very sad-looking woman, and she never smiles. She is passionately devoted to her husband and her son. She is not mad, Mr. Holmes. I am sure of that. But she has some secret sorrow, and I have seen her in tears more than once.” “And the child?” “The child is a boy of six. He is a spoiled, ill-natured child, with a disproportionately large head. He is always in a rage or a sulk, and he delights in cruelty to weaker creatures. He is a dreadful child, Mr. Holmes. I have never seen such a child.” “You have painted a grim picture, Miss Hunter. Pray tell us all the details, however trivial they may seem. You can never tell what may be of importance.” “Well, sir, I will tell you everything. The servants are a man and his wife, Toller and his wife. Toller is a rough, drunken fellow, and his wife is a tall, strong, sour-faced woman. They are not pleasant people, Mr. Holmes. I don’t like them at all.” “And what about the strange requests?” “Ah, yes, sir. That is the strangest part of all. For the first two days I was there, nothing happened. Then, on the third day, Mrs. Rucastle said to her husband, ‘John, I think it is time.’ And he said, ‘Very well, my dear. I will speak to Miss Hunter.’ And then he came to me and said, ‘Miss Hunter, I have a little favour to ask of you. I want you to wear this dress.’ He held out a dress of electric blue. It was a very beautiful dress, and it fitted me perfectly. But it had been worn before. I could see that.” “And you wore it?” “Yes, sir. I put it on, and I went down to the drawing-room. Mr. and Mrs. Rucastle were there, and they both expressed the greatest delight at the sight of me. Mr. Rucastle said, ‘My dear Miss Hunter, you look charming! You are a perfect picture!’ And Mrs. Rucastle said, ‘Indeed you do, Miss Hunter. You are quite lovely.’ They made me sit in a particular chair in the drawing-room, facing away from the central window. And then Mr. Rucastle began to tell me funny stories. He told me story after story for an hour, and he made me laugh heartily. Mrs. Rucastle sat there all the time, looking sad and anxious.” “And then?” “Then, two days later, the same thing happened again. I was asked to wear the blue dress, and I sat in the same chair, and Mr. Rucastle told me funny stories. This time, however, he ended by asking me to read aloud from a novel for ten minutes. I did so, and then he abruptly told me to stop.” “This is very strange,” said Holmes. “And you have no idea what it means?” “None at all, sir. But I was consumed with curiosity. I could not understand why they should want me to do these things. And I was particularly curious about what was happening outside the window. I felt sure that there was something going on that they did not want me to see.” “And what did you do?” “I determined to find out. The next time I was asked to perform, I took a piece of broken mirror with me, which I concealed in my handkerchief. While I was pretending to laugh at Mr. Rucastle’s stories, I held the mirror in such a way that I could see what was happening outside the window.” “And what did you see?” “I saw a man standing on the road, leaning on the railings. He was a small man, with a beard, and he was dressed in grey. He was looking towards the house.” “And did he see you?” “I don’t know, sir. But I saw Mrs. Rucastle watching me intently. I am sure that she saw the mirror in my hand. She pointed out the man to her husband, and he came to the window and looked out. Then he turned to me and said, ‘Miss Hunter, will you be so good as to motion that impertinent fellow away?’ I did as he asked, and the man walked away. As soon as he was gone, Mrs. Rucastle drew the blind.” “And when was this?” “That was a week ago, sir. I have not worn the dress or sat in the window since, nor have I seen the man.” “This is indeed a most singular story,” said Holmes. “But you mentioned another strange incident.” “Ah, yes, sir. That was about the dog. Mr. Rucastle has a large, fierce mastiff, which is kept chained up near the kitchen. He showed it to me one day, and he said, ‘Miss Hunter, I must warn you never to go out at night. Toller lets the dog loose then, and it is fed very little, so it is always keen.’ I have seen the dog myself, sir. It is a dreadful creature. One night, I saw it prowling about the lawn in the moonlight. It is a most dangerous animal.” “And the locked drawer?” “Yes, sir. That is the strangest thing of all. In my room, there is a chest of drawers, and one of the drawers is locked. I tried to open it, but I could not. Then I remembered that I had a number of keys on my bunch, and I tried them one after another. At last, I found one that fitted, and I opened the drawer.” “And what did you find?” “I found a coil of hair, sir. It was a coil of chestnut hair, and it was exactly the same colour as my own hair. I was very much surprised, and I took it out and looked at it. Then I went to my trunk and looked at my own hair, which I had cut off some time ago. It was still there, so the coil in the drawer was not mine. I could not understand it at all. I put the hair back in the drawer and locked it again. I have not said anything about it to anyone.”",

While I was pretending to laugh at Mr. Rucastle’s stories, I held the mirror in such a way that I could see what was happening outside the window.” “And what did you see?” “I saw a man standing on the road, leaning on the railings. He was a small man, with a beard, and he was dressed in grey. He was looking towards the house.” “And did he see you?” “I don’t know, sir. But I saw Mrs. Rucastle watching me intently. I am sure that she saw the mirror in my hand. She pointed out the man to her husband, and he came to the window and looked out. Then he turned to me and said, ‘Miss Hunter, will you be so good as to motion that impertinent fellow away?’ I did as he asked, and the man walked away. As soon as he was gone, Mrs. Rucastle drew the blind.” “And when was this?” “That was a week ago, sir. I have not worn the dress or sat in the window since, nor have I seen the man.” “This is indeed a most singular story,” said Holmes. “But you mentioned another strange incident.” “Ah, yes, sir. That was about the dog. Mr. Rucastle has a large, fierce mastiff, which is kept chained up near the kitchen. He showed it to me one day, and he said, ‘Miss Hunter, I must warn you never to go out at night. Toller lets the dog loose then, and it is fed very little, so it is always keen.’ I have seen the dog myself, sir. It is a dreadful creature. One night, I saw it prowling about the lawn in the moonlight. It is a most dangerous animal.” “And the locked drawer?” “Yes, sir. That is the strangest thing of all. In my room, there is a chest of drawers, and one of the drawers is locked. I tried to open it, but I could not. Then I remembered that I had a number of keys on my bunch, and I tried them one after another. At last, I found one that fitted, and I opened the drawer.” “And what did you find?” “I found a coil of hair, sir. It was a coil of chestnut hair, and it was exactly the same colour as my own hair. I was very much surprised, and I took it out and looked at it. Then I went to my trunk and looked at my own hair, which I had cut off some time ago. It was still there, so the coil in the drawer was not mine. I could not understand it at all. I put the hair back in the drawer and locked it again. I have not said anything about it to anyone.”",

          "text_segment": "“I am naturally observant, as you may have remarked, Mr. Holmes, and I soon had a pretty good plan of the whole house in my head. There was one wing, however, which appeared not to be inhabited at all. A door which faced that which led into the quarters of the Tollers opened into this suite, but it was invariably locked. One day, however, as I ascended the stair, I met Mr. Rucastle coming out through this door, his keys in his hand, and a look on his face which made him a very different person to the round, jovial man to whom I was accustomed. His cheeks were red, his brow was all crinkled with anger, and the veins stood out at his temples with passion. He locked the door and hurried past me without a word or a look.\n“This aroused my curiosity, so when I went out for a walk in the grounds with my charge, I strolled round to the side from which I could see the windows of this part of the house. There were four of them in a row, three of which were simply dirty, while the fourth was shuttered up. They were evidently all deserted. As I strolled up and down, glancing at them occasionally, Mr. Rucastle came out to me, looking as merry and jovial as ever.\n“‘Ah!’ said he, ‘you must not think me rude if I passed you without a word, my dear young lady. I was preoccupied with business matters.’\n“I assured him that I was not offended. ‘By the way,’ said I, ‘you seem to have quite a suite of spare rooms up there, and one of them has the shutters up.’\n“He looked surprised and, as it seemed to me, a little startled at my remark.\n“‘Photography is one of my hobbies,’ said he. ‘I have made my dark room up there. But, dear me! what an observant young lady we have come upon. Who would have believed it? Who would have ever believed it?’ He spoke in a jesting tone, but there was no jest in his eyes as he looked at me. I read suspicion there and annoyance, but no jest.\n“Well, Mr. Holmes, from the moment that I understood that there was something about that suite of rooms which I was not to know, I was all on fire to go over them. It was not mere curiosity, though I have my share of that. It was more a feeling of duty—a feeling that some good might come from my penetrating to this place. They talk of woman’s instinct; perhaps it was woman’s instinct which gave me that feeling. At any rate, it was there, and I was keenly on the lookout for any chance to pass the forbidden door.\n“It was only yesterday that the chance came. I may tell you that, besides Mr. Rucastle, both Toller and his wife find something to do in these deserted rooms, and I once saw him carrying a large black linen bag with him through the door. Recently he has been drinking hard, and yesterday evening he was very drunk; and when I came upstairs there was the key in the door. I have no doubt at all that he had left it there. Mr. and Mrs. Rucastle were both downstairs, and the child was with them, so that I had an admirable opportunity. I turned the key gently in the lock, opened the door, and slipped through.\n“There was a little passage in front of me, unpapered and uncarpeted, which turned at a right angle at the farther end. Round this corner were three doors in a line, the first and third of which were open. They each led into an empty room, dusty and cheerless, with two windows in the one and one in the other, so thick with dirt that the evening light glimmered dimly through them. The centre door was closed, and across the outside of it had been fastened one of the broad bars of an iron bed, padlocked at one end to a ring in the wall, and fastened at the other with stout cord. The door itself was locked as well, and the key was not there. This barricaded door corresponded clearly with the shuttered window outside, and yet I could see by the glimmer from beneath it that the room was not in darkness. Evidently there was a skylight which let in light from above. As I stood in the passage gazing at the sinister door and wondering what secret it might veil, I suddenly heard the sound of steps within the room and saw a shadow pass backward and forward against the little slit of dim light which shone out from under the door. A mad, unreasoning terror rose up in me at the sight, Mr. Holmes. My overstrung nerves failed me suddenly, and I turned and ran—ran as though some dreadful hand were behind me clutching at the skirt of my dress. I rushed down the passage, through the door, and straight into the arms of Mr. Rucastle, who was waiting outside.\n“‘So,’ said he, smiling, ‘it was you, then. I thought that it must be when I saw the door open.’\n“‘Oh, I am so frightened!’ I panted.\n“‘My dear young lady! my dear young lady!’—you cannot think how caressing and soothing his manner was—‘and what has frightened you, my dear young lady?’\n“But his voice was just a little too coaxing. He overdid it. I was keenly on my guard against him.\n“‘I was foolish enough to go into the empty wing,’ I answered. ‘But it is so lonely and eerie in this dim light that I was frightened and ran out again. Oh, it is so dreadfully still in there!’\n“‘Only that?’ said he, looking at me keenly.\n“‘Why, what did you think?’ I asked.\n“‘Why do you think that I lock this door?’\n“‘I am sure that I do not know.’\n“‘It is to keep people out who have no business there. Do you see?’ He was still smiling in the most amiable manner.\n“‘I am sure if I had known—’\n“‘Well, then, you know now. And if you ever put your foot over that threshold again’—here in an instant the smile hardened into a grin of rage, and he glared down at me with the face of a demon—‘I’ll throw you to the mastiff.’\n“I was so terrified that I do not know what I did. I suppose that I must have rushed past him into my room. I remember nothing until I found myself lying on my bed trembling all over. Then I thought of you, Mr. Holmes. I could not live there longer without some advice. I was frightened of the house, of the man, of the woman, of the servants, even of the child. They were all horrible to me. If I could only bring you down all would be well. Of course I might have fled from the house, but my curiosity was almost as strong as my fears. My mind was soon made up. I would send you a wire. I put on my hat and cloak, went down to the office, which is about half a mile from the house, and then returned, feeling very much easier. A horrible doubt came into my mind as I approached the door lest the dog might be loose, but I remembered that Toller had drunk himself into a state of insensibility that evening, and I knew that he was the only one in the household who had any influence with the savage creature, or who would venture to set him free. I slipped in in safety and lay awake half the night in my joy at the thought of seeing you. I had no difficulty in getting leave to come into Winchester this morning, but I must be back before three o’clock, for Mr. and Mrs. Rucastle are going on a visit, and will be away all the evening, so that I must look after the child. Now I have told you all my adventures, Mr. Holmes, and I should be very glad if you could tell me what it all means, and, above all, what I should do.”",

There was the long, low house, with the great roof, the gravel drive, and the copper beeches beyond. The rooms on the ground floor were the dining-room and Mr. Rucastle’s study. On the floor above was my bedroom, the governess’s, and that of the little chap, with the two spare rooms, and a long corridor leading to the nursery and the servants’ quarters. There were no less than seven doors in this corridor, and my attention was especially drawn to one of them, which was the last in the line, and which was always locked upon the inside. There was no bell or other means of communication, and nothing was ever heard to issue from it. I had frequently seen Mr. Rucastle himself on the landing outside this door, and once or twice he had been there when my little charge, Edward, had wanted to pass along the passage. He always instantly ordered him back, and seemed to be very angry at his approaching it. I have heard him tell his wife that it was not safe for anyone to go down the corridor, and I have often remarked that he was exceedingly careful to keep the door locked. There were windows from this passage, and I could see three of them from my own bedroom window. They were heavily curtained, however, and I could make out nothing within them. One day, as I was walking in the grounds near the house, I observed that one of these windows was open, and I distinctly saw a young woman sitting by it, reading. Her face was turned towards me, and I could see that she was young and beautiful, with dark hair and eyes. She seemed to be very sad, and her face was pale and thin. I had never seen her before, and I wondered who she could be. I mentioned the matter to Mrs. Rucastle, but she seemed to be very much annoyed, and told me that I was mistaken. She said that there was no young woman in the house except myself, and that the window must have been open for ventilation. I did not press the matter further, but I was not satisfied with her explanation. I felt sure that I had seen someone, and I was determined to find out who it was. I had noticed that Mr. Rucastle was very particular about the locking of the door, and I suspected that there was some mystery connected with it. I had also observed that Toller, the butler, and his wife, who was the housekeeper, sometimes went into this part of the house. I once saw Toller carrying a large black bag, which seemed to be very heavy, and he went into the locked wing. I was more than ever convinced that there was something strange going on.

I was overcome with terror, and fled back into the passage. As I did so, I ran straight into Mr. Rucastle, who was waiting outside the door. He initially spoke soothingly, asking me what I was doing there. His tone was overly coaxing, however, and it put me on my guard. I claimed that the empty wing’s eerie stillness had frightened me.

My friend rose now and paced up and down the room, his hands in his pockets, and an expression of the most profound gravity upon his face.\n“Is Toller still drunk?” he asked.\n“Yes. I heard his wife tell Mrs. Rucastle that she could do nothing with him.”\n“That is well. And the Rucastles go out to-night?”\n“Yes.”\n“Is there a cellar with a good strong lock?”\n“Yes, the wine-cellar.”\n“You seem to me to have acted all through this matter like a very brave and sensible girl, Miss Hunter. Do you think that you could perform one more feat? I should not ask it of you if I did not think you a quite exceptional woman.”\n“I will try. What is it?”\n“We shall be at the Copper Beeches by seven o’clock, my friend and I. The Rucastles will be gone by that time, and Toller will, we hope, be incapable. There only remains Mrs. Toller, who might give the alarm. If you could send her into the cellar on some errand, and then turn the key upon her, you would facilitate matters immensely.”\n“I will do it.”\n“Excellent! We shall then look thoroughly into the affair. Of course there is only one feasible explanation. You have been brought there to personate someone, and the real person is imprisoned in this chamber. That is obvious. As to who this prisoner is, I have no doubt that it is the daughter, Miss Alice Rucastle, if I remember right, who was said to have gone to America. You were chosen, doubtless, as resembling her in height, figure, and the colour of your hair. Hers had been cut off, very possibly in some illness through which she has passed, and so, of course, yours had to be sacrificed also. By a curious chance you came upon her tresses. The man in the road was undoubtedly some friend of hers—possibly her fiancé—and no doubt, as you wore the girl’s dress and were so like her, he was convinced from your laughter, whenever he saw you, and afterwards from your gesture, that Miss Rucastle was perfectly happy, and that she no longer desired his attentions. The dog is let loose at night to prevent him from endeavouring to communicate with her. So much is fairly clear. The most serious point in the case is the disposition of the child.”\n“What on earth has that to do with it?” I ejaculated.\n“My dear Watson, you as a medical man are continually gaining light as to the tendencies of a child by the study of the parents. Don’t you see that the converse is equally valid. I have frequently gained my first real insight into the character of parents by studying their children. This child’s disposition is abnormally cruel, merely for cruelty’s sake, and whether he derives this from his smiling father, as I should suspect, or from his mother, it bodes evil for the poor girl who is in their power.”\n“I am sure that you are right, Mr. Holmes,” cried our client. “A thousand things come back to me which make me certain that you have hit it. Oh, let us lose not an instant in bringing help to this poor creature.”\n“We must be circumspect, for we are dealing with a very cunning man. We can do nothing until seven o’clock. At that hour we shall be with you, and it will not be long before we solve the mystery.”",

The great detective sat, however, with an absolutely impassive face, his eyes fixed steadily upon the fire. When his young client had tailed off into silence he continued for some time in the same thoughtful attitude. Then a long, thin curl of blue smoke ascended from the chemical paper which he was burning in the grate. “I confess that you have entirely justified my hopes,” he remarked. “Your tale is most interesting, and I shall be greatly surprised if we do not finish it in a most dramatic manner. The great thing is, of course, to secure the lady, and then we can easily get the truth from her. By the way, I suppose you know where the wine-cellar is?” “Yes, sir, we have dined in it once when the dining-room was being painted.” “You are sure that you can get the key?” “Yes, sir, the butler keeps it.” “Surely that is rather careless of him?” “He is usually very careful with it. I know that he keeps it in the drawer of the pantry table. It was sure to be there.” “Excellent! Now, you are aware that I am a busy man, and that my time is a good deal occupied. If you will kindly give me your attention for a few minutes I shall endeavour to show you that we are really much nearer a solution than you may at first imagine. I may call your attention to the fact that the curious incident of the hair was two days ago. Now, you were engaged, as I understand, to take the place of some one else. It is most probable that she was an invalid, whose hair had been cut off by her illness, and that you were engaged because your hair was of the same colour as hers. We will suppose that this lady was confined to her room for some reason, and that for this reason she desired to have her presence kept a secret from her neighbours. You will observe that she was in her own house, and yet she was not permitted either to come down stairs or to show herself at the window. These, then, were clearly the reasons why you were employed.” “I see it all now!” I cried. “And the man in the road – the lover, no doubt – who was deceived in the dusk by the resemblance between you, and who was forced to go away heartbroken at the thought that she had ceased to love him.” “Exactly. You see the force of it, Miss Hunter? Then the child, who was sent in to see you, was clearly for the purpose of ascertaining whether your hair was of the exact colour. And the dog would be kept in the room to prevent her from making any attempt to communicate with the outside. The facts all fit together admirably.” “But the key?” I asked. “The key to the mystery, my dear Watson, is, as I suspected, in the cellar. The lady is in the cellar.” “Of course! The locked room, the secrecy, the child, the dog – it is all as clear as possible!” “The child’s cruelty,” said Holmes, “is a more serious matter. It suggests an abnormal vindictiveness in the child, which seems to be an echo of the parents. Small sins are like straws upon the surface of the water; he who would search for pearls must dive below. That child’s spirit is a sign of a foul soul in the father or mother. But what is the object of this elaborate deception, Miss Hunter?” “To prevent her from inheriting her fortune, no doubt,” I suggested. “Precisely. You see, Miss Hunter, the lady is clearly of age, since her fortune is mentioned. It is equally clear that she is not allowed to dispose of it, or she would not be kept in this fashion. If she is of age, then she can only be kept in durance by force or fraud. The former is out of the question where there are no guards or walls. It is, therefore, fraud which keeps her in bondage. You are the fraud, my dear young lady, and a very successful fraud you have been. You have played your part admirably. It is clear that the daughter, Alice Rucastle, was to be married, and that this was to be the occasion upon which she was to enter into possession of her fortune. They desired to postpone this marriage, it would seem, and so, since they could not persuade her, they took this means of keeping her out of the way. That is my reconstruction of the case, and I commend it to your notice.” “But Alice is in America,” I cried. “We had a letter from her yesterday.” “Excellent, my dear Watson! That is the finishing touch. I challenge you to show me a more perfect case of what I may call a floating population. What does it all mean? It means that she is in the cellar, and that no one knows it save her parents. If you had not come, she would probably have remained there until her marriage or death had made some change in her position.” “But how did they get her there?” “Ah, there is the question. I fancy that it was done by force. The lady may have been ill, and when she recovered her senses she found herself a prisoner.” “But the child?” “The child is a creature of impulse, and her cruelty",

                "text": "Holmes and I had listened spellbound to this extraordinary story. The great detective sat, however, with an absolutely impassive face, his eyes fixed steadily upon the fire. When his young client had tailed off into silence he continued for some time in the same thoughtful attitude. Then a long, thin curl of blue smoke ascended from the chemical paper which he was burning in the grate. “I confess that you have entirely justified my hopes,” he remarked. “Your tale is most interesting, and I shall be greatly surprised if we do not finish it in a most dramatic manner. The great thing is, of course, to secure the lady, and then we can easily get the truth from her. By the way, I suppose you know where the wine-cellar is?” “Yes, sir, we have dined in it once when the dining-room was being painted.” “You are sure that you can get the key?” “Yes, sir, the butler keeps it.” “Surely that is rather careless of him?” “He is usually very careful with it. I know that he keeps it in the drawer of the pantry table. It was sure to be there.” “Excellent! Now, you are aware that I am a busy man, and that my time is a good deal occupied. If you will kindly give me your attention for a few minutes I shall endeavour to show you that we are really much nearer a solution than you may at first imagine. I may call your attention to the fact that the curious incident of the hair was two days ago. Now, you were engaged, as I understand, to take the place of some one else. It is most probable that she was an invalid, whose hair had been cut off by her illness, and that you were engaged because your hair was of the same colour as hers. We will suppose that this lady was confined to her room for some reason, and that for this reason she desired to have her presence kept a secret from her neighbours. You will observe that she was in her own house, and yet she was not permitted either to come down stairs or to show herself at the window. These, then, were clearly the reasons why you were employed.” “I see it all now!” I cried. “And the man in the road – the lover, no doubt – who was deceived in the dusk by the resemblance between you, and who was forced to go away heartbroken at the thought that she had ceased to love him.” “Exactly. You see the force of it, Miss Hunter? Then the child, who was sent in to see you, was clearly for the purpose of ascertaining whether your hair was of the exact colour. And the dog would be kept in the room to prevent her from making any attempt to communicate with the outside.

The group of trees, with their dark leaves shining like burnished metal in the light of the setting sun, were sufficient to mark the house even had Miss Hunter not been standing smiling on the door-step.\n“Have you managed it?” asked Holmes.\nA loud thudding noise came from somewhere downstairs. “That is Mrs. Toller in the cellar,” said she. “Her husband lies snoring on the kitchen rug. Here are his keys, which are the duplicates of Mr. Rucastle’s.”\n“You have done well indeed!” cried Holmes with enthusiasm. “Now lead the way, and we shall soon see the end of this black business.”\nWe passed up the stair, unlocked the door, followed on down a passage, and found ourselves in front of the barricade which Miss Hunter had described. Holmes cut the cord and removed the transverse bar. Then he tried the various keys in the lock, but without success. No sound came from within, and at the silence Holmes’ face clouded over.\n“I trust that we are not too late,” said he. “I think, Miss Hunter, that we had better go in without you. Now, Watson, put your shoulder to it, and we shall see whether we cannot make our way in.”\nIt was an old rickety door and gave at once before our united strength. Together we rushed into the room. It was empty. There was no furniture save a little pallet bed, a small table, and a basketful of linen. The skylight above was open, and the prisoner gone.\n“There has been some villainy here,” said Holmes; “this beauty has guessed Miss Hunter’s intentions and has carried his victim off.”\n“But how?”\n“Through the skylight. We shall soon see how he managed it.” He swung himself up onto the roof. “Ah, yes,” he cried, “here’s the end of a long light ladder against the eaves. That is how he did it.”\n“But it is impossible,” said Miss Hunter; “the ladder was not there when the Rucastles went away.”\n“He has come back and done it. I tell you that he is a clever and dangerous man. I should not be very much surprised if this were he whose step I hear now upon the stair. I think, Watson, that it would be as well for you to have your pistol ready.”",

Mrs. Toller has been out all day at Aldershot, and has only just returned. She is not well, and has gone to her room. The others are all in bed, and I am sure I can get the keys of the South wing without anyone knowing.” She showed us into a dim-lit dining-room, and we waited in silence while she noiselessly ascended the stairs and returned in a few minutes with a ring of keys in her hand. “Here they are,” she said. “The key of the passage is the one with the square handle; the second is my own bedroom, and the third is the door you want. There is no other lock upon it from the inside, but it is barred at night.” “Thank you,” said Holmes. “We are much indebted to you, Miss Hunter. And now it is time that we went to work.” We stole out into the silent passage, into which a dim lamp threw a feeble light. There was the white door before us. We eagerly and silently approached it. The key was a rusty one, and turned with difficulty in the lock. We pushed the door open, and before us was a long, bare passage, with the moonlight streaming in through a single window at the farther end. We closed our door behind us, and passed down the corridor, Holmes leading the way, with the candle which he had brought with him. Here and there were wicker chairs upon the uncarpeted floor, and a disused organ stood glumly in a corner. Then we came to a second door, the fourth from the end. Holmes paused, and held up the candle to examine it. “I am not surprised that Mr. Rucastle is very anxious that no one should enter this room,” he said. “It is barred twice on the inside, as you can see. It was not bolted last night when I examined it.” He tried a key from the bunch, but it would not turn the lock. “An inner bolt,” said he. “I am afraid, Watson, that we shall have to break it down.” “A stout door,” I remarked. “Ay, and a stout thing behind it, I fear. Look at the size of the bar! It is perfectly enormous.” He paused with his hand upon the knob. “I am convinced that the woman is there,” he said. “I am convinced that Rucastle has carried out his threat, and that she is now a prisoner.” As he spoke, there came a low sound from within, a sort of groan, and then a sharp cry of pain. “She is there!” cried Holmes, in a voice of horror. “She is there, and she is suffering! We must break down the door!” He put his shoulder to it, and I did the same. It was a solid oaken door, and it resisted our united efforts. “The bar! The bar!” he cried. “If we can but remove the bar, the door will open.” We worked at it with our hands and with the candle, but it was useless. The bar was a massive one, and it was firmly fixed. “We must get help,” said Holmes. “Miss Hunter, can you not find us a tool of some kind?” She was standing behind us, pale and trembling. “I will try,” she said, and hurried away. In a few minutes she returned with a small axe. “It is the only thing I can find,” she said. “It is the woodman’s axe.” “Excellent!” cried Holmes. “This will do.” He took the axe, and with a few vigorous blows, he severed the bar. The door flew open, and we rushed in. The room was empty. There was a bed, a chair, and a table, and that was all. The window was open, and the moonlight streamed in. “She is gone!” cried Holmes. “She has escaped!” “But how?” I asked. “Through the window,” he answered. “Look!” He pointed to the window. It was a long, narrow window, and it opened outwards. “She could not have got through there,” I said. “It is too narrow.” “Look again,” he said. “There is a ladder against the wall.” I looked, and saw that there was indeed a long ladder against the wall,",

I have my revolver.\" \"He will be down directly,\" said Holmes. \"We shall hear him. Stand back to the wall!\" We stood in the angle of the corridor, and in a few seconds we heard the heavy tread of Rucastle upon the stairs. He was coming down with a rush, and we could hear the rattle of a chain. \"The dog!\" cried Holmes. \"He has got the dog!\" We heard a savage growl, and then a scream of agony, followed by a horrible worrying sound. \"He's got him!\" cried Holmes. \"He's got him!\" We rushed down the stairs, and as we turned the corner we saw a sight which I shall never forget. Rucastle was lying upon the ground, and a huge, savage mastiff was standing over him, its muzzle buried in his throat. The dog was tearing at him, and the blood was spurting out in a stream. \"Shoot him, Watson! Shoot him!\" cried Holmes. I raised my revolver and fired. The dog gave a convulsive shudder and rolled over upon its side. Rucastle was still alive, but he was horribly mangled. We dragged the dog off him, and carried him into the drawing-room. He was a dreadful sight, with his throat torn open and his face covered with blood. Watson did what he could to stop the bleeding, and then we sent Toller, who had staggered out from a side door, a red-faced, elderly man, to inform his wife. \"Someone loosed the dog,\" he cried. \"It's been two days since it was fed. I told him it was dangerous.\" He was",

          "text_segment": "We were all assembled round him when the door opened, and a tall, gaunt woman entered the room.\n“Mrs. Toller!” cried Miss Hunter.\n“Yes, miss. Mr. Rucastle let me out when he came back before he went up to you. Ah, miss, it is a pity you didn’t let me know what you were planning, for I would have told you that your pains were wasted.”\n“Ha!” said Holmes, looking keenly at her. “It is clear that Mrs. Toller knows more about this matter than anyone else.”\n“Yes, sir, I do, and I am ready enough to tell what I know.”\n“Then, pray, sit down, and let us hear it for there are several points on which I must confess that I am still in the dark.”\n“I will soon make it clear to you,” said she; “and I’d have done so before now if I could ha’ got out from the cellar. If there’s police-court business over this, you’ll remember that I was the one that stood your friend, and that I was Miss Alice’s friend too.\n“She was never happy at home, Miss Alice wasn’t, from the time that her father married again. She was slighted like and had no say in anything, but it never really became bad for her until after she met Mr. Fowler at a friend’s house. As well as I could learn, Miss Alice had rights of her own by will, but she was so quiet and patient, she was, that she never said a word about them but just left everything in Mr. Rucastle’s hands. He knew he was safe with her; but when there was a chance of a husband coming forward, who would ask for all that the law would give him, then her father thought it time to put a stop on it. He wanted her to sign a paper, so that whether she married or not, he could use her money. When she wouldn’t do it, he kept on worrying her until she got brain-fever, and for six weeks was at death’s door. Then she got better at last, all worn to a shadow, and with her beautiful hair cut off; but that didn’t make no change in her young man, and he stuck to her as true as man could be.”\n“Ah,” said Holmes, “I think that what you have been good enough to tell us makes the matter fairly clear, and that I can deduce all that remains. Mr. Rucastle then, I presume, took to this system of imprisonment?”\n“Yes, sir.”\n“And brought Miss Hunter down from London in order to get rid of the disagreeable persistence of Mr. Fowler.”\n“That was it, sir.”\n“But Mr. Fowler being a persevering man, as a good seaman should be, blockaded the house, and having met you succeeded by certain arguments, metallic or otherwise, in convincing you that your interests were the same as his.”\n“Mr. Fowler was a very kind-spoken, free-handed gentleman,” said Mrs. Toller serenely.\n“And in this way he managed that your good man should have no want of drink, and that a ladder should be ready at the moment when your master had gone out.”\n“You have it, sir, just as it happened.”\n“I am sure we owe you an apology, Mrs. Toller,” said Holmes, “for you have certainly cleared up everything which puzzled us. And here comes the country surgeon and Mrs. Rucastle, so I think, Watson, that we had best escort Miss Hunter back to Winchester, as it seems to me that our locus standi now is rather a questionable one.”\nAnd thus was solved the mystery of the sinister house with the copper beeches in front of the door. Mr. Rucastle survived, but was always a broken man, kept alive solely through the care of his devoted wife. They still live with their old servants, who probably know so much of Rucastle’s past life that he finds it difficult to part from them. Mr. Fowler and Miss Rucastle were married, by special license, in Southampton the day after their flight, and he is now the holder of a government appointment in the island of Mauritius. As to Miss Violet Hunter, my friend Holmes, rather to my disappointment, manifested no further interest in her when once she had ceased to be the centre of one of his problems, and she is now the head of a private school at Walsall, where I believe that she has met with considerable success.",

This is your doing, Mr. Holmes, I suppose?” “Yes. We have rather freed the prisoner and secured the person who shut her up.” “Then it was you who shut me up as well. I hear the key turn in the lock.” “It was a necessary precaution. We were not sure what part you might have in the matter.” “I nothing at all. I knew of it, of course. I knew all about it. But I could do little, for I am but a poor woman. When he brought that girl here as governess it did seem to me that some good might come of it. It was you, miss, who saved her. God bless you for it! It is a pity that you did not come a little sooner, and save me the trouble of getting to let out myself.” “You mean that you had a key?” “Yes, miss, I have the key of every lock in the house. As to that, I could not let myself out, for he had the key in his pocket, but I got it from him.” “You mean that you searched him?” “I waited till he was asleep, and then I took the key. He always sleeps heavily after drink, and he had been drinking hard. She had been out three days when you came, miss. I waited and waited to see if I could get a word with you, but that woman was always after you. Then I thought that if I put you to the trouble of getting to her it would show you how near she was. But I began to think that you were afraid, and that we should have to make the best of it. Oh, miss, I did love her so, and she would have loved me if she had had her way. It is a pity that she was not strong enough to fight her own battle. But she was not, and so she had to be saved by others.” “She is safe now, at any rate,” said Holmes. “And the man who wronged her is punished.” “He is punished, sure enough,” said Mrs. Toller. “He will carry the mark of it to his grave.” “But you, Mrs. Toller,” said Holmes. “What about you? You have been an accomplice in this matter.” “I have been an accomplice in this matter,” she said, “but I have not been a willing one. I have been forced into it. I have been a slave in this house for twenty years, and I have been treated worse than a slave. I have been beaten and starved and insulted. I have been made to do things that I hated. I have been made to lie and to deceive. I have been made to help in this wickedness. But I have not been a willing accomplice. I have been forced into it.” “Well, well,” said Holmes. “I am not here to judge you. I am here to find out the truth. You say that you were forced into it. Who forced you?” “He did,” she said, pointing to the prostrate figure. “He forced me. He threatened me. He beat me. He starved me. He made my life a hell upon earth. And that woman, his wife, she was worse than he was. She was a devil. She was a fiend. She was a monster.” She stopped and seemed to choke. “I cannot speak of her,” she said. “She is too horrible.” “Well, then,” said Holmes, “let us hear about this young lady, Alice Rucastle. You say that she was forced into this marriage.” “No,” said Mrs. Toller. “She was not forced into it. She was not married at all. She was engaged to be married to a young gentleman, Mr. Fowler, who is a very worthy young man. But her father did not like him, and he would not let her marry him. He wanted her to marry a man of his own choosing, a man with a great deal of money. But she would not. She loved Mr. Fowler, and she would not give him up. So her father shut her up in this house, and he kept her a prisoner. He wanted to break her spirit, and to make her marry the man he had chosen. But he could not. She was too strong for him. She would not give in.” “And how long has she been shut up?” asked Holmes. “She has been shut up for three years,” said Mrs. Toller. “Three years! And you have been here all the time?” “Yes, I have been here all the time. I have seen it all. I have seen her suffer. I have seen her pine away. I have seen her grow thin and pale. I have seen her hair cut off. I have seen her treated like a dog. And I could do nothing. I could do nothing.” She began to weep bitterly. “Well, well,” said Holmes. “Do not distress yourself. It is all over now. She is safe, and you are safe. And as for this man, he will trouble no one any more. But tell me, Mrs. Toller, how did you manage to get the key from him?” “I told you,” she said. “I waited till he",
