                "refinement_prompt": "IMPROVEMENT GUIDANCE:\n1. MAJOR STRUCTURAL ISSUES:\n- The completion omits the final exchange between the two characters, specifically the dialogue and instructions that occur after Holmes reassures his companion. This results in the passage ending prematurely and missing a key transition to the next event.\n\n2. MISSING ELEMENTS:\n- The completion does not include the brief discussion about the client, which is present in the original. This missing exchange is important for establishing the context and the reason for the companion to remain present.\n- The instruction given by Holmes regarding where the companion should sit and what he should do is also absent. This is a notable omission as it sets up the scene for the arrival of the next character.\n\n3. INACCURATE ELEMENTS:\n- The sequence of events is mostly preserved, but the omission of the final lines leads to an incomplete representation of the original passage's progression. There are no invented events or perspectives, but the lack of the closing dialogue and instructions affects the overall accuracy and flow."

                "refinement_prompt": "IMPROVEMENT GUIDANCE:\n1. MAJOR STRUCTURAL ISSUES:\n- Early in the passage, the completion invents a conversation where Holmes claims not to have met Irene Adler and comments on her singing, which does not occur in the original. This invented dialogue replaces a key section where Holmes instructs Watson to consult his index and where Watson finds Adler's biography.\n- The completion omits the entire process of Holmes referencing his personal index and Watson locating Adler's biography among other entries. This is a significant structural omission, as it establishes Holmes's methodical approach and the context for the information about Adler.\n\n2. MISSING ELEMENTS:\n- The completion lacks the description of Holmes's system for cataloging information and the specific placement of Adler's biography between other figures. This missing step removes important characterization and context.\n- The summary of Adler's background is missing the step-by-step review Holmes performs, including her birthplace, year, and career milestones, which are present in the original.\n\n3. INACCURATE ELEMENTS:\n- The completion introduces inaccurate details, such as Holmes claiming to have heard Adler sing at La Scala and discussing her residence at a specific address, which are not part of the original passage at this point.\n- The sequence of events is altered: the invented conversation about Holmes's knowledge of Adler and her address occurs before the discussion of the compromising letters, disrupting the original order.\n- The rest of the exchange about the letters and evidence is mostly accurate in sequence, but the earlier inaccuracies and omissions affect the overall fidelity to the original passage."

Our acquaintance was at first of the most casual nature, but it soon ripened into something more intimate. I found her to be a woman of rare intelligence and resource, and, though I was at all times on my guard, I could not help but admire her spirit and her cleverness. It was during this period that I became aware of her connection with several persons of influence, and I realized that she was a woman who could hold her own in any company.\n\nIt was not long before I discovered that she possessed a photograph of myself, taken under circumstances which, if made public, would be exceedingly compromising. I made several attempts to recover this photograph, but she was always one step ahead of me. Her ingenuity in evading my efforts only increased my respect for her abilities. Eventually, I was forced to abandon my pursuit, and I returned to England, hoping that the matter would be forgotten.\n\nHowever, it seems that Miss Adler has not forgotten me, and I have reason to believe that she intends to use the photograph for her own purposes. That is why I have come to you, Mr. Holmes. I am in need of your assistance to recover the photograph and to ensure that my reputation remains intact."

I made my way to the offices of the firm, and, under the pretext of business, I managed to see Mr. Duncan Ross, the red-headed gentleman who had engaged me. He was, if possible, more flaming than ever in his attire, and his hair seemed to glow with a deeper shade of red. I asked him a few questions about the nature of the work, and he replied with a geniality that was almost excessive. He assured me that the duties were exactly as described, and that I would find the work both easy and remunerative. I left the office with my mind in a whirl, but determined to continue my employment and see what would come of it.\n\nFor the next eight weeks I worked steadily at the copying, arriving at the office at ten o’clock each morning and leaving at two. Mr. Ross was always there to greet me, and he would often drop in to see how I was getting on. The work itself was monotonous, but the pay was excellent, and I began to feel that I had stumbled upon a rare piece of good fortune. However, one morning, upon arriving at the office, I found the door locked and a notice affixed to it. The Red-Headed League had been dissolved. I stood there in the street, bewildered and angry, not knowing what to do. I made inquiries in the neighbourhood, but no one had ever heard of the League, nor of Mr. Duncan Ross. It was as if they had vanished into thin air. In my perplexity, I turned to my friend, Mr. Sherlock Holmes, for advice and assistance."

I have seldom heard him mention her under any other name. In his eyes she eclipses and predominates the whole of her sex. It was not that he felt any emotion akin to love for Irene Adler. All emotions, and that one particularly, were abhorrent to his cold, precise but admirably balanced mind. He was, I take it, the most perfect reasoning and observing machine that the world has seen, but as a lover he would have placed himself in a false position. He never spoke of the softer passions, save with a gibe and a sneer. They were admirable things for the observer—excellent for drawing the veil from men’s motives and actions. But for the trained reasoner to admit such intrusions into his own delicate and finely adjusted temperament was to introduce a distracting factor which might throw a doubt upon all his mental results. Grit in a sensitive instrument, or a crack in one of his own high-power lenses, would not be more disturbing than a strong emotion in a nature such as his. And yet there was but one woman to him, and that woman was the late Irene Adler, of dubious and questionable memory.\n\nI had seen little of Holmes lately. My marriage had drifted us away from each other. My own complete happiness, and the home-centred interests which rise up around the man who first finds himself master of his own establishment, were sufficient to absorb all my attention, while Holmes, who loathed every form of society with his whole Bohemian soul, remained in our lodgings in Baker Street, buried among his old books, and alternating from week to week between cocaine and ambition, the drowsiness of the drug, and the fierce energy of his own keen nature."

Holmes advanced along it, and, at the third door, he paused and knocked in a peculiar fashion—three quick taps, followed by two slow ones.\n\nThe door was opened instantly by a small, wizened man with a shrewd, wrinkled face and keen, grey eyes. He peered at us suspiciously for a moment, then, recognizing Holmes, his manner changed at once to one of deference.\n\n\"Ah, Mr. Holmes! You are expected. The gentleman is within.\"\n\nHolmes nodded and motioned for me to follow. We entered a small, comfortably furnished room, where a tall, distinguished-looking man rose to greet us. He was dressed in the fashion of the previous decade, with a high collar and a black frock coat, and his manner was one of quiet dignity.\n\n\"Mr. Holmes,\" he said, \"I am glad that you have come. I have been most anxious to consult you.\"\n\n\"Pray be seated, sir,\" said Holmes, indicating a chair. \"This is my friend and colleague, Dr. Watson, upon whose discretion you may entirely rely.\"\n\nThe stranger bowed to me and resumed his seat. Holmes took a chair opposite him, and I sat beside my friend, notebook in hand.\n\n\"You may speak freely before Dr. Watson,\" Holmes continued. \"He has assisted me in many of my most important cases.\"\n\nThe gentleman inclined his head. \"My name is Lord St. Simon,\" he said. \"You may have heard of me.\"\n\nHolmes smiled. \"Your lordship's name is familiar to me, and I am aware of the recent events which have brought you into the public eye.\"\n\nLord St. Simon sighed. \"It is a most distressing affair, Mr. Holmes. I have come to you as a last resort.\"\n\n\"I shall be happy to serve you in any way that I can.\"\n\n\"You are doubtless aware of the facts, but perhaps I had better state them in my own words.\"\n\n\"If you would be so good.\"\n\n\"I was married yesterday, Mr. Holmes, to Miss Hatty Doran, the daughter of a wealthy American. The ceremony was performed at St. George's, Hanover Square, and was attended by a large and fashionable company. After the wedding breakfast, my wife and I drove to my house in Park Lane. There, in the drawing-room, she excused herself for a moment, saying that she wished to see her maid. She left the room, and that was the last I saw of her.\"\n\nHolmes leaned forward, his eyes shining with interest. \"And she has not been seen since?\"\n\n\"No, sir. I have made every inquiry. The police have been informed, and every effort has been made to trace her, but without success.\"\n\n\"Was there anything in her manner during the day to suggest that she was unhappy or unwilling?\"\n\n\"Nothing whatever. She was in excellent spirits, and appeared to be looking forward to our new life together.\"\n\n\"And you can suggest no possible cause for her disappearance?\"\n\nLord St. Simon hesitated. \"There was one incident, Mr. Holmes, which may or may not have a bearing upon the case. Shortly before the wedding, a man called at the house and asked to see Miss Doran. He was a stranger, and gave no name. He was refused admittance, but I saw him from the window. He was a tall, dark man, with a military bearing.\"\n\nHolmes made a note. \"And you have no idea who he was?\"\n\n\"None whatever.\"\n\n\"Did Miss Doran seem agitated after this visit?\"\n\n\"She was a little pale, but she said nothing.\"\n\n\"Thank you, Lord St. Simon. I think I have all the information I need for the present. I shall make it my business to look into the matter at once.\"\n\nLord St. Simon rose. \"I am deeply obliged to you, Mr. Holmes. If you should learn anything, I beg that you will communicate with me at once.\"\n\n\"You may rely upon it. Good evening, my lord.\"\n\nWhen he had gone, Holmes turned to me with a smile. \"Well, Watson, what do you make of it?\"\n\n\"It is a most singular case,\" I replied. \"The sudden disappearance of the bride, the mysterious stranger—there are elements of romance and intrigue.\"\n\n\"Precisely. And yet, I have a feeling that the explanation may be a simple one. Come, let us see what we can learn.\""

My respect for his powers of analysis increased wondrously. There was, however, no time for comment, for the street door had opened, and a heavy step was heard upon the stairs. With a quick motion, Holmes pulled me back into the darkest corner of the room. Presently we heard the creak of the boots as the man crossed the passage, and the sharp click of the key as he entered. He closed the door behind him, and then, to our amazement, he lit the lamp and threw himself down into an armchair, with the air of a man who is thoroughly at home. Holmes’s eyes were fixed upon me, and I could read in them a warning not to move. A minute later the man’s attention was attracted by a slight noise, and he sprang to his feet, looking about him in every direction. ‘Who’s there?’ he cried. ‘Who’s in this room with me?’”"

I do not know what to do.”\n\nHolmes leaned forward and patted her hand reassuringly. “Compose yourself, madam, and tell us your story.”\n\nShe seemed to gather herself together, and her voice became more steady as she began her narrative. “My name is Helen Stoner, and I am living with my stepfather, who is the last survivor of one of the oldest Saxon families in England, the Roylotts of Stoke Moran, on the western border of Surrey.”\n\nHolmes nodded his head. “Pray proceed,” said he.\n\n“My stepfather, Dr. Grimesby Roylott, was the last member of his family, save myself and my sister Julia, who died under most mysterious circumstances two years ago. It is about her death that I wish to speak to you.”"

            "prefix-probing": "I think, too, that I may safely promise that the matter will pass out of your life. You will be none the worse for the adventure. As for the photograph, I am sure that if Miss Adler had it in her possession she would have let me have it. Since she has not, I can only conclude that it is in a place where she is herself unable to lay hands upon it.\"\n\n\"But what will you do, Mr. Holmes?\"\n\n\"I shall do nothing. I have already done all that is necessary. The case is finished.\"\n\nAnd thus it was that the great scandal threatened to affect the kingdom of Bohemia, and how the best plans of Mr. Sherlock Holmes were beaten by a woman's wit. He used to make merry over the cleverness of women, but I have heard him say that he would never take the woman’s name in vain again. And when he speaks of Irene Adler, or when he refers to her photograph, it is always under the honourable title of 'the woman.'\n\nI trust that I have made the sequence of events clear. The King of Bohemia, having been threatened with the exposure of a compromising photograph, had sought the aid of Sherlock Holmes. Holmes, with his usual acumen, had traced the photograph to Irene Adler, and by a clever ruse had discovered its hiding place. Yet, in the end, it was Irene Adler herself who outwitted Holmes, escaping with her new husband and leaving behind a letter and a photograph as a token of her respect for the great detective.\n\nHolmes, for his part, bore no ill-will. On the contrary, he admired her resourcefulness and intelligence. \"She is indeed a remarkable woman, Watson,\" he said to me as we walked back to Baker Street. \"I have seldom been so taken aback.\"\n\n\"You have been foiled, Holmes,\" I remarked.\n\n\"Yes, Watson, I have been foiled. But what a worthy opponent! I can only hope that I may meet her again, though I doubt she will ever cross my path.\"\n\nThe King, for his part, was relieved that the photograph would not be used against him. He expressed his gratitude to Holmes in the most lavish terms, and pressed upon him a ring of great value. Holmes, however, refused all reward save the photograph of Irene Adler herself, which he placed in his private collection.\n\nThus ends the adventure of the photograph, and with it, the tale of the woman who bested Sherlock Holmes. It is a story I have often recounted, for it shows that even the greatest of men may be outwitted, and that the keenest intellect may sometimes be matched by a woman's wit and courage."

Then God help us all!” she whispered. For a moment she stood motionless, her hands clasped before her, and then, with a sudden effort, she seemed to recover her self-control. “You must come in, sir,” she said. “My mistress will see you. She is expecting you.”\n\nI followed her through a dimly lit passage, the air heavy with the scent of old wood and faded flowers. The house was silent, save for the faint ticking of a clock somewhere in the distance. At the end of the corridor, she paused before a door and knocked softly. A low voice bade us enter, and I found myself in a small, plainly furnished sitting-room. By the window, a woman sat in a high-backed chair, her face pale and drawn, her hands tightly clasped in her lap. She looked up as we entered, and I saw at once that she had been weeping.\n\n“Dr. Watson?” she said, her voice trembling. “You have come from the police?”\n\n“I have come from Mr. Holmes,” I replied gently. “He asked me to see you at once.”\n\nShe gave a little sigh of relief. “Then you know—about my poor husband?”\n\n“I know that he has met with a terrible fate,” I said. “Mr. Holmes is doing all in his power to discover the truth.”\n\nShe bowed her head. “It is all so sudden—so dreadful. I cannot believe that he is gone. Only this morning he was with me, laughing and talking as usual. And now—” Her voice broke, and she covered her face with her hands.\n\nI waited in silence until she had regained her composure. Presently she looked up again. “You will help us, Dr. Watson? You and Mr. Holmes?”\n\n“Indeed, madam, you may rely upon us,” I assured her. “But I must ask you to tell me all you can remember of what happened.”\n\nShe nodded. “I will try. It was just after breakfast when my husband went out. He said he had some business in the city, and that he would return before luncheon. I did not see him again until—until they brought him home.”\n\nHer voice faltered, and I saw the tears glistening in her eyes. I waited patiently, knowing that it was best to let her tell her story in her own way."

They laid me on a couch, I motioned for air, they were compelled to open the window, and you had your chance.”\n“How did that help you?”\n“It was all-important. When a woman thinks that her house is on fire, her instinct is at once to rush to the thing which she values most. It is a perfectly overpowering impulse, and I have more than once taken advantage of it. In the case of the Darlington Substitution Scandal it was of use to me, and also in the Arnsworth Castle business. A married woman grabs at her baby; an unmarried one reaches for her jewel-box. Now it was clear to me that our lady of to-day had nothing in the house more precious to her than what we are in quest of. She would rush to secure it. The alarm of fire was admirably done. The smoke and shouting were enough to shake nerves of steel. She responded beautifully. The photograph is in a recess behind a sliding panel just above the right bell-pull. She was there in an instant, and I caught a glimpse of it as she half drew it out. When I cried out that it was a false alarm, she replaced it, glanced at the rocket, rushed from the room, and I have not seen her since. I rose, and, making my excuses, escaped from the house. I hesitated whether to attempt to secure the photograph at once; but the coachman had come in, and as he was watching me narrowly, it seemed safer to wait. A little over-precipitance may ruin all.”\n“And now?” I asked.\n“Our quest is practically finished. I shall call with the King to-morrow, and with you, if you care to come with us. We will be shown into the sitting-room to wait for the lady, but it is probable that when she comes she may find neither us nor the photograph. It might be a satisfaction to his Majesty to regain it with his own hands.”\n“And when will you call?”\n“At eight in the morning. She will not be up, so that we shall have a clear field. Besides, we must be prompt, for this marriage may mean a complete change in her life and habits. I must wire to the King without delay.”",

The gas-lamps, spaced at intervals along the pavement, cast their yellow pools of light upon the wet flagstones, and the distant rumble of carriages was muffled by the thick, moist air. Holmes strode on with his long, nervous steps, his head sunk upon his chest and his sharp eyes darting from side to side as he noted every detail of our surroundings.\n\nPresently, he halted abruptly before a low, unpretentious house, the windows of which were closely curtained. He glanced at the number upon the door, and then, with a quick gesture, beckoned me to follow him up the steps. He rang the bell, and we waited in silence until the door was opened by a small, elderly woman, whose face was wrinkled and anxious.\n\n\"Mr. Holmes?\" she inquired in a low voice.\n\n\"Yes,\" he replied, \"and this is my friend, Dr. Watson. We have come in response to your message.\"\n\nShe nodded and led us down a narrow passage, the walls of which were adorned with faded prints and a few dusty china ornaments. At the end of the passage she opened a door and ushered us into a small sitting-room, where a single lamp burned upon the table, casting strange shadows upon the walls. A man sat in an armchair by the fire, his face pale and drawn, his hands nervously clasped together.\n\n\"This is my husband, Mr. Holmes,\" said the woman. \"He is the one who has suffered so much.\"\n\nHolmes advanced and took the man's hand in his own, examining it closely. \"You have been through a great deal, sir,\" he said gently. \"But I hope that we may be able to help you.\"\n\nThe man looked up with a start, his eyes wide and fearful. \"It is the most extraordinary thing, Mr. Holmes,\" he said in a trembling voice. \"I have never known such terror.\"\n\n\"Perhaps you will tell us the whole story,\" Holmes suggested, seating himself opposite the man and motioning for me to do the same.\n\nThe man hesitated for a moment, then began to speak in a low, hurried tone. \"It began about a week ago. I was returning home late at night, and as I turned the corner into this street, I had the distinct impression that I was being followed. I glanced back, but could see no one. Still, the feeling persisted, and I quickened my pace. When I reached my door, I turned once more, and for an instant I thought I saw a shadow slip into the alley across the way.\"\n\nHe paused, shuddering. \"Since then, I have been haunted by the same sensation. At times, I have caught glimpses of a figure lurking in the darkness, always just out of sight. My nerves are quite unstrung, Mr. Holmes. I scarcely dare to leave the house.\"\n\nHolmes listened intently, his keen eyes fixed upon the man's face. \"You have noticed nothing else unusual? No letters, no messages, no threats?\"\n\n\"Nothing, sir. Only this dreadful sense of being watched.\"\n\nHolmes nodded thoughtfully. \"We shall do our best to get to the bottom of the matter. Dr. Watson and I will remain here tonight, if you have no objection.\"\n\nThe man and his wife exchanged glances of relief. \"We should be most grateful, Mr. Holmes.\"\n\n\"Very good. Now, if you will permit me, I should like to examine the house and the immediate neighbourhood. Dr. Watson, perhaps you will accompany me.\"\n\nI rose at once, and together we stepped out into the night, the mystery deepening with every shadow that flickered across the silent street."

This narrative reflection and description of their behavior during the drive is not present in the original passage and constitutes an invented segment.\n\n2. MISSING ELEMENTS:\n- The completion omits the brief exchange that clarifies the mode of transportation, specifically the statement that the brougham is waiting and the resulting simplification of their plans. While the brougham is mentioned, the explicit acknowledgment of how it simplifies matters is missing.\n- The transition from the breakfast scene to their departure is less direct, lacking the concise movement from the room to the street as in the original.\n\n3. INACCURATE ELEMENTS:\n- The completion inaccurately describes the group as being in a cab, whereas the original specifies a different vehicle.\n- The sequence of events is slightly altered: the conversation about Irene Adler's marriage occurs after the invented introspective scene, rather than immediately upon departure as in the original.\n- The completion refers to \"Miss Adler\" and \"Mr. Godfrey Norton\" in the marriage announcement, whereas the original uses different forms of address and does not include the full name in this context.\n- The phrase \"interfere with Your Majesty's plans\" is used instead of the original's wording, which changes the nuance of the King's concerns.\n- The King's reaction and the flow of dialogue are generally preserved, but the insertion of invented narrative and minor shifts in dialogue attribution affect the accuracy of the sequence and tone."

I have a small shop at Coburg Square, near the City. It is not a very large affair, and of late years the business has been rather slack. I used to be able to keep two assistants, but now I only have one; and I would not have him if it were not for the fact that he is willing to come for half wages.\"\n\n\"That would be Mr. Vincent Spaulding?\" said Holmes.\n\n\"Yes, that is the name—the best assistant I ever had, though I have had a dozen. He is quick and willing, and I am much obliged to him.\"\n\n\"How long has he been with you?\" asked Holmes.\n\n\"About a year and a half.\"\n\n\"How did he come?\"\n\n\"In answer to an advertisement. I advertised for an assistant, and he came. He was a small, white-faced, clean-shaven young man, with a very quick way of speaking. He is not such a youth as you might fancy, for his hair is almost white, though his age cannot be more than thirty.\"\n\n\"Has he any faults?\"\n\n\"None whatever. I never saw such a fellow for photography. Always snapping away with a camera when he is not working, and then diving down into the cellar like a rabbit into its hole to develop his pictures. That is his only fault, but on the whole he is a very good worker.\"\n\n\"He is still with you, I presume?\"\n\n\"Yes, sir. He and a girl of fourteen, who does a bit of simple cooking and keeps the place clean—that is all I have in the house, for I am a widower and never had any family. We live very quietly, sir, the three of us; and we keep a roof over our heads and pay our way, if we do not get rich.\"\n\n\"I must ask you to be a little more precise as to the details,\" said Holmes. \"When did this curious business begin?\"\n\n\"It was about eight weeks ago. I had a small bill to pay, so I went down to the City to get the money. I was coming back about one o'clock, when I saw a little crowd gathered in front of the office. I pushed my way in, and found that the door was locked, and that there was a notice pasted in the window. I had never seen it before, and I could not imagine what it meant.\""

As he glanced down the advertisement column, with his head thrust forward and the paper flattened out upon his knee, I took a good look at the man and endeavoured, after the fashion of my companion, to read the indications which might be presented by his dress or appearance.\nI did not gain very much, however, by my inspection. Our visitor bore every mark of being an average commonplace British tradesman, obese, pompous, and slow. He wore rather baggy grey shepherd’s check trousers, a not over-clean black frock-coat, unbuttoned in the front, and a drab waistcoat with a heavy brassy Albert chain, and a square pierced bit of metal dangling down as an ornament. A frayed top-hat and a faded brown overcoat with a wrinkled velvet collar lay upon a chair beside him. Altogether, look as I would, there was nothing remarkable about the man save his blazing red head, and the expression of extreme chagrin and discontent upon his features.\nSherlock Holmes’ quick eye took in my occupation, and he shook his head with a smile as he noticed my questioning glances. “Beyond the obvious facts that he has at some time done manual labour, that he takes snuff, that he is a Freemason, that he has been in China, and that he has done a considerable amount of writing lately, I can deduce nothing else.”\nMr. Jabez Wilson started up in his chair, with his forefinger upon the paper, but his eyes upon my companion.\n“How, in the name of good-fortune, did you know all that, Mr. Holmes?” he asked. “How did you know, for example, that I did manual labour. It’s as true as gospel, for I began as a ship’s carpenter.”\n“Your hands, my dear sir. Your right hand is quite a size larger than your left. You have worked with it, and the muscles are more developed.”\n“Well, the snuff, then, and the Freemasonry?”\n“I won’t insult your intelligence by telling you how I read that, especially as, rather against the strict rules of your order, you use an arc-and-compass breastpin.”\n“Ah, of course, I forgot that. But the writing?”\n“What else can be indicated by that right cuff so very shiny for five inches, and the left one with the smooth patch near the elbow where you rest it upon the desk?”\n“Well, but China?”\n“The fish that you have tattooed immediately above your right wrist could only have been done in China. I have made a small study of tattoo marks and have even contributed to the literature of the subject. That trick of staining the fishes’ scales of a delicate pink is quite peculiar to China.

It ran in this way:\n\n'TO THE RED-HEADED LEAGUE.—On account of the bequest of the late Ezekiah Hopkins, of Lebanon, Pennsylvania, U.S.A., there is now another vacancy open which entitles a member of the League to a salary of four pounds a week for purely nominal services.

It seemed to me to be a wonderful opportunity, for I am a man of small means, and the salary was a considerable one. All red-headed men, it said, and I have a fine head of hair, though it has begun to fade a trifle with age. I had a business, and I could not leave it, but my assistant, Vincent Spaulding, was very eager that I should apply.'\n\n'He seemed to take a great interest in the matter, did he?' said Holmes.\n\n'Yes, sir, he did, indeed. He was very keen upon it, and he made light of my objections. \"Why should you not apply?\" said he. \"There is no harm done. You might get the place, and if not, there is no harm done. It is a little extra money every week, and you might as well have it as another.\"'\n\n'Well, I thought it over, Mr. Holmes, and at last I determined to apply. I did so, and that was how I came to be connected with the Red-Headed League.'\n\n'And what was the result of your application?' asked Holmes.\n\n'Well, sir, I went to the address given, and I found a queue of men with red hair stretching down the street. Never have I seen such a sight. There were men of every shade of red, from the fiery red of the Irishman to the brick-dust red of the Scotchman. I was almost disheartened, but my assistant encouraged me, and at last my turn came.'"

MISSING ELEMENTS:\n- Early in the passage, the completion does not include Mr. Wilson's action of mopping his forehead, which is a descriptive detail that sets the scene.\n- In the final part, the completion leaves out the information about Mr. Wilson being a widower and never having had any family, as well as the description of their modest lifestyle and financial situation.\n\n3. INACCURATE ELEMENTS:\n- Early in the completion, Mr. Wilson refers to himself as a bachelor, which is inaccurate; the original provides a different marital status.\n- The phrase \"have no family\" is used at the end, which is a simplification and does not accurately reflect the original's more nuanced explanation of his family situation.\n- The sequence of information about the household staff and Mr. Wilson's personal circumstances is slightly altered, with some details condensed or omitted, affecting the flow and completeness of the narrative."

            "prefix-probing": "Looking at the date, I see that it is just over a year ago. The article to which I refer appears to be a short paragraph in the social column, and it runs in this way:\n\n‘Our readers will remember how last year the celebrated Mr. Sherlock Holmes was instrumental in bringing to justice the notorious Colonel Lysander Stark, who had so long eluded the vigilance of the police. The case, which excited so much interest at the time, was remarkable for the ingenuity of the criminal and the singular methods by which he sought to conceal his identity. We are glad to learn that Mr. Holmes, whose services to the public are so well known, has been able to add another laurel to his already distinguished career.’\n\nHolmes smiled as he read the paragraph aloud. ‘You see, Watson, how the press can sometimes be both accurate and yet so very vague. They mention the case, but not the details, and my name, but not the method. It is as if they wish to praise, but not to inform.’\n\nI nodded, recalling the events of that memorable case. ‘It was indeed a singular affair, Holmes. I remember how you traced the Colonel by the peculiar mud on his boots, and how you deduced his hiding place from the pattern of the dust on the floor.’\n\nHolmes leaned back in his chair, folding the newspaper. ‘It is often the smallest details, Watson, that lead to the solution. The press may overlook them, but we must not. That is the difference between the chronicler and the detective.’\n\nHe rose and placed the paper on the mantelpiece. ‘Now, let us see what the day brings. There is always another mystery waiting to be solved in the streets of London.’\n\nAs he spoke, there came a sharp rap at the door, and Mrs. Hudson entered with a card upon a tray. Holmes glanced at it, his keen eyes lighting up with interest.\n\n‘A new client, Watson. Let us see what adventure awaits us now.’\n\nWith that, we prepared ourselves for another of those strange and fascinating cases which have made the name of Sherlock Holmes a byword wherever men speak of the science of deduction."

Spaulding, he came down into the office just this day eight weeks, with this very paper in his hand, and he says:\n“‘I wish to the Lord, Mr. Wilson, that I was a red-headed man.’\n“‘Why that?’ I asks.\n“‘Why,’ says he, ‘here’s another vacancy on the League of the Red-headed Men. It’s worth quite a little fortune to any man who gets it, and I understand that there are more vacancies than there are men, so that the trustees are at their wits’ end what to do with the money. If my hair would only change colour, here’s a nice little crib all ready for me to step into.’\n“‘Why, what is it, then?’ I asked. You see, Mr. Holmes, I am a very stay-at-home man, and as my business came to me instead of my having to go to it, I was often weeks on end without putting my foot over the door-mat. In that way I didn’t know much of what was going on outside, and I was always glad of a bit of news.\n“‘Have you never heard of the League of the Red-headed Men?’ he asked with his eyes open.\n“‘Never.’\n“‘Why, I wonder at that, for you are eligible yourself for one of the vacancies.’\n“‘And what are they worth?’ I asked.\n“‘Oh, merely a couple of hundred a year, but the work is slight, and it need not interfere very much with one’s other occupations.’\n“Well, you can easily think that that made me prick up my ears, for the business has not been over good for some years, and an extra couple of hundred would have been very handy.\n“‘Tell me all about it,’ said I.\n“‘Well,’ said he, showing me the advertisement, ‘you can see for yourself that the League has a vacancy, and there is the address where you should apply for particulars. As far as I can make out, the League was founded by an American millionaire, Ezekiah Hopkins, who was very peculiar in his ways. He was himself red-headed, and he had a great sympathy for all red-headed men; so, when he died, it was found that he had left his enormous fortune in the hands of trustees, with instructions to apply the interest to the providing of easy berths to men whose hair is of that colour. From all I hear it is splendid pay and very little to do.’\n“‘But,’ said I, ‘there would be millions of red-headed men who would apply.’\n“‘Not so many as you might think,’ he answered. ‘You see it is really confined to Londoners, and to grown men. This American had started from London when he was young, and he wanted to do the old town a good turn. Then, again, I have heard it is no use your applying if your hair is light red, or dark red, or anything but real bright, blazing, fiery red. Now, if you cared to apply, Mr. Wilson, you would just walk in; but perhaps it would hardly be worth your while to put yourself out of the way for the sake of a few hundred pounds.’\n“Now, it is a fact, gentlemen, as you may see for yourselves, that my hair is of a very full and rich tint, so that it seemed to me that if there was to be any competition in the matter I stood as good a chance as any man that I had ever met. Vincent Spaulding seemed to know so much about it that I thought he might prove useful, so I just ordered him to put up the shutters for the day and to come right away with me. He was very willing to have a holiday, so we shut the business up and started off for the address that was given us in the advertisement.\n“I never hope to see such a sight as that again, Mr. Holmes. From north, south, east, and west every man who had a shade of red in his hair had tramped into the city to answer the advertisement. Fleet Street was choked with red-headed folk, and Pope’s Court looked like a coster’s orange barrow. I should not have thought there were so many in the whole country as were brought together by that single advertisement. Every shade of colour they were—straw, lemon, orange, brick, Irish-setter, liver, clay; but, as Spaulding said, there were not many who had the real vivid flame-coloured tint. When I saw how many were waiting, I would have given it up in despair; but Spaulding would not hear of it. How he did it I could not imagine, but he pushed and pulled and butted until he got me through the crowd, and right up to the steps which led to the office. There was a double stream upon the stair, some going up in hope, and some coming back dejected; but we wedged in as well as we could and soon found ourselves in the office.”",

INACCURATE ELEMENTS:\n- The sequence of events is altered: the completion suggests a delay before visiting the address, rather than an immediate departure as in the original.\n- The dialogue is condensed, and some questions and responses are omitted or merged, which changes the flow and pacing of the conversation.\n- The narrator's internal reasoning and decision-making process are abbreviated, leading to a less detailed and less accurate portrayal of his motivations.\n- The description of the crowd and the process of getting through it is mostly accurate, but the lead-up to this scene is missing key steps and context from earlier in the passage."

            "prefix-probing": "It was so peculiarly worded, and so unlike anything that one would expect to see in a respectable paper, that it at once attracted our attention. The very phrasing of it, with its curious mixture of urgency and secrecy, seemed to suggest that there was something more behind it than met the eye. Holmes, with his usual keen perception, was the first to point out the oddity of the language. He read it aloud to me, his eyes twinkling with interest as he did so.\n\n'Look at this, Watson,' he said, handing me the paper. 'What do you make of it?'\n\nI took the advertisement and read it carefully. It ran as follows:\n\n'WANTED—A young man, sound of limb and mind, willing to undertake a singular and not unpleasant duty. Must be of good character and ready to begin at once. Apply in person between the hours of ten and eleven at 221B Baker Street.'\n\n'It is certainly unusual,' I remarked. 'The address is our own, Holmes!'\n\n'Precisely,' he replied. 'And that is what makes it so interesting. Someone wishes to draw us into a case, but wishes to do so in a manner that will not attract undue attention. The advertisement is a signal, Watson—a signal to us.'\n\n'But who could have placed it? And for what purpose?'\n\n'Ah, that is the question. We shall soon find out, for I have no doubt that we shall have a visitor this morning.'\n\nAs if in answer to his words, there came a sharp rap at the door. Mrs. Hudson entered a moment later, her face wearing an expression of mild curiosity.\n\n'A young man to see you, Mr. Holmes,' she announced.\n\n'Show him in, please, Mrs. Hudson.'\n\nA moment later, a young man of about twenty-five entered the room. He was well-dressed, but there was a nervousness in his manner that betrayed his agitation. He glanced from Holmes to myself, and then back again, as if uncertain which of us was the master of the house.\n\n'Pray take a seat,' said Holmes kindly. 'You have come in answer to the advertisement?'\n\n'Yes, sir,' the young man replied. 'My name is John Mason. I saw the notice in the paper this morning, and I thought I would inquire.'\n\n'Quite right, Mr. Mason. May I ask what led you to believe that you would be suitable for the position?'\n\n'I am strong and healthy, sir, and I have always tried to do my duty. I have no family, and I am willing to undertake any honest work.'\n\nHolmes regarded him thoughtfully for a moment. 'You say you have no family. May I ask where you reside?'\n\n'I have lodgings in Camden Town, sir.'\n\n'And your occupation?'\n\n'I am a clerk, sir, but my employer has recently gone out of business, and I am looking for a new position.'\n\n'You have references, I suppose?'\n\n'Yes, sir. I can provide them if you wish.'\n\n'Excellent. Now, Mr. Mason, I must ask you a few questions of a rather personal nature. You will, I hope, forgive my curiosity.'\n\n'Of course, sir.'\n\n'Have you ever been in trouble with the law?'\n\n'No, sir. Never.'\n\n'Are you in debt?'\n\n'No, sir.'\n\n'Good. Now, can you tell me if you have noticed anything unusual in your life recently? Any strangers following you, or any odd occurrences?'\n\nThe young man looked surprised. 'No, sir. Nothing of the sort.'\n\nHolmes nodded. 'Very well. I think you will do, Mr. Mason. The duty I require of you is simple, but it may involve some danger. Are you prepared for that?'\n\n'I am, sir.'\n\n'Excellent. I shall give you further instructions in due course. For now, I must ask you to keep this matter entirely to yourself. Not a word to anyone, do you understand?'\n\n'I do, sir.'\n\n'Good. That will be all for now. I shall send for you when I require your services.'\n\nThe young man rose, thanked Holmes, and took his leave. As soon as the door had closed behind him, I turned to my friend.\n\n'What do you make of it, Holmes?'\n\n'It is precisely as I suspected, Watson. Someone wishes to use us as a means to an end, but they are going about it in a most roundabout fashion. We must be on our guard.'\n\n'But what is the purpose of it all?'\n\n'Patience, my dear Watson. All will be revealed in time. For now, we must wait and watch.'\n\nAnd so began one of the most curious cases that ever came to us at Baker Street—a case that would test both our wits and our courage to the utmost."

He said a few words to each candidate as he came up, and then he always managed to find some fault in them which would disqualify them. Getting a vacancy did not seem to be such a very easy matter, after all. However, when our turn came the little man was much more favourable to me than to any of the others, and he closed the door as we entered, so that he might have a private word with us.\n“‘This is Mr. Jabez Wilson,’ said my assistant, ‘and he is willing to fill a vacancy in the League.’\n“‘And he is admirably suited for it,’ the other answered. ‘He has every requirement. I cannot recall when I have seen anything so fine.’ He took a step backward, cocked his head on one side, and gazed at my hair until I felt quite bashful. Then suddenly he plunged forward, wrung my hand, and congratulated me warmly on my success.\n“‘It would be injustice to hesitate,’ said he. ‘You will, however, I am sure, excuse me for taking an obvious precaution.’ With that he seized my hair in both his hands, and tugged until I yelled with the pain. ‘There is water in your eyes,’ said he as he released me. ‘I perceive that all is as it should be. But we have to be careful, for we have twice been deceived by wigs and once by paint. I could tell you tales of cobbler’s wax which would disgust you with human nature.’ He stepped over to the window and shouted through it at the top of his voice that the vacancy was filled. A groan of disappointment came up from below, and the folk all trooped away in different directions until there was not a red-head to be seen except my own and that of the manager.\n“‘My name,’ said he, ‘is Mr. Duncan Ross, and I am myself one of the pensioners upon the fund left by our noble benefactor. Are you a married man, Mr. Wilson? Have you a family?’\n“I answered that I had not.\n“His face fell immediately.\n“‘Dear me!’ he said gravely, ‘that is very serious indeed! I am sorry to hear you say that. The fund was, of course, for the propagation and spread of the red-heads as well as for their maintenance. It is exceedingly unfortunate that you should be a bachelor.’\n“My face lengthened at this, Mr. Holmes, for I thought that I was not to have the vacancy after all; but after thinking it over for a few minutes he said that it would be all right.\n“‘In the case of another,’ said he, ‘the objection might be fatal, but we must stretch a point in favour of a man with such a head of hair as yours. When shall you be able to enter upon your new duties?’\n“‘Well, it is a little awkward, for I have a business already,’ said I.\n“‘Oh, never mind about that, Mr. Wilson!’ said Vincent Spaulding. ‘I should be able to look after that for you.’\n“‘What would be the hours?’ I asked.\n“‘Ten to two.’\n“Now a pawnbroker’s business is mostly done of an evening, Mr. Holmes, especially Thursday and Friday evening, which is just before pay-day; so it would suit me very well to earn a little in the mornings. Besides, I knew that my assistant was a good man, and that he would see to anything that turned up.\n“‘That would suit me very well,’ said I. ‘And the pay?’\n“‘Is £ 4 a week.’\n“‘And the work?’\n“‘Is purely nominal.’\n“‘What do you call purely nominal?’\n“‘Well, you have to be in the office, or at least in the building, the whole time.

You don’t comply with the conditions if you budge from the office during that time.’\n“‘It’s only four hours a day, and I should not think of leaving,’ said I.\n“‘No excuse will avail,’ said Mr. Duncan Ross; ‘neither sickness nor business nor anything else. There you must stay, or you lose your billet.’\n“‘And the work?’\n“‘Is to copy out the Encyclopædia Britannica. There is the first volume of it in that press. You must find your own ink, pens, and blotting-paper, but we provide this table and chair. Will you be ready to-morrow?’\n“‘Certainly,’ I answered.\n“‘Then, good-bye, Mr. Jabez Wilson, and let me congratulate you once more on the important position which you have been fortunate enough to gain.’ He bowed me out of the room and I went home with my assistant, hardly knowing what to say or do, I was so pleased at my own good fortune.",

So you can imagine my surprise when Vincent Spaulding, who is now with me, came down into the office one morning with this very paper in his hand and said:\n\n‘“I wish to the Lord, Mr. Wilson, that I was a red-headed man.”\n\n‘“Why that?” I asks.\n\n‘“Why,” says he, “here’s another vacancy on the League, and what is it worth? Two hundred a year. But the work is slight, and it need not interfere very much with one’s other occupations.”\n\n‘Well, I was doing nothing myself at the time, and I thought I might as well look into the matter. If there was a chance of getting it, I had as good a right to it as any other red-headed man. So, as Spaulding seemed to know all about it, he offered to go with me, and we started off together.\n\n‘When we reached the address given, we found a long line of men with red hair, waiting their turn. Some of them were as red as a fox, but few had the real vivid flame-colour. When I saw how many were waiting, I would have given it up in despair; but Spaulding would not hear of it. How he did it I could not imagine, but he pushed and pulled and butted until he got me through the crowd and right up to the steps, which led to the office. There was a double stream of applicants, some going up in hope, and some coming back dejected; but at last we were in front of the door and knocked. We were at once admitted into the office by a little man in a velvet coat, with a head that was even redder than mine.

MISSING ELEMENTS:\n- The early part of the passage omits the description of the office's contents and the behavior of the man behind the table toward other candidates, including his tendency to find faults and disqualify them. This context is important for understanding the protagonist's experience.\n- The moment when the little man closes the door for a private conversation is not included, which is a key transition in the original narrative.\n- The assistant's introduction of the protagonist to the little man is missing, as is the little man's initial favorable reaction and his physical gesture of stepping back to examine the protagonist's hair.\n- The original includes a brief internal reflection by the protagonist about his concern over not getting the position due to his bachelor status, which is only partially represented in the completion.\n- The specific instructions about the need to provide one's own writing materials are less detailed in the completion, and the original's emphasis on the nominal nature of the work and the consequences of leaving the office are not fully captured.\n\n3. INACCURATE ELEMENTS:\n- The invented dialogue about the client's personal details (name, address, age) is inaccurate and not present in the original.\n- The sequence of events is altered: the questioning about personal details precedes the examination of the protagonist's hair, whereas in the original, the focus is on the hair and the suitability for the position.\n- The conditions for the job are inaccurately expanded in the completion, including invented restrictions such as not receiving letters or telegrams and not walking about, which are not specified in the original passage.\n- The description of the work to be done is altered, with the completion specifying that the protagonist must begin at the beginning of the first volume and continue through the whole set, and describing the task as dry and monotonous, which is not the focus in the original.\n- The completion repeats the pay amount and the nature of the work in a way that differs from the original's structure and emphasis.\n- The closing of the passage is generally accurate in terms of the protagonist's reaction, but the invented and reordered elements throughout affect the overall fidelity to the source."

            "prefix-probing": "“Your experience has been a most entertaining one,” remarked Holmes as his client paused and refreshed his memory with a huge pinch of snuff.\n\n“I am glad to have furnished you with amusement, Mr. Holmes,” said he, with a slight sneer. “But I must ask you what you intend to do about it. I have given you all the facts.”\n\n“My dear sir,” said Holmes, “your case is most interesting, and I shall be happy to look into it. From what you have told me, I gather that you have been the victim of a singular fraud, and that the matter is not yet ended. I shall be glad to make inquiries, and I have little doubt that we shall arrive at a satisfactory solution.”\n\nThe client rose, with a look of satisfaction upon his face. “I am much obliged to you, Mr. Holmes. You will let me know the result?”\n\n“Certainly. In the meantime, I should be glad if you would let me have any further details which may occur to you.”\n\n“I will do so. Good-morning.”\n\nHe bowed and left the room.\n\nHolmes sat for some time in silence, with his chin upon his hands, lost in thought. Then he lit his pipe, and leaned back in his chair.\n\n“It is a curious case, Watson,” said he at last. “Very curious indeed. I think that we may safely take it that our client has not told us quite all that he knows. There are points in his story which suggest that he is keeping something back.”\n\n“Do you think so?” I asked.\n\n“I am sure of it. But we must work with the materials which we have. I think, Watson, that we shall do well to make a few inquiries in the neighbourhood of Saxe-Coburg Square.”\n\n“And what do you propose to do?”\n\n“To smoke,” he answered. “It is quite a three-pipe problem, and I beg that you won’t speak to me for fifty minutes.”\n\nHe curled himself up in his chair, with his thin knees drawn up to his hawk-like nose, and there he sat with his eyes closed and his black clay pipe thrusting out like the bill of some strange bird. I had come to the conclusion that he had dropped asleep, and indeed was nodding myself, when he suddenly sprang out of his chair with the gesture of a man who has made up his mind and put his pipe down upon the mantelpiece.\n\n“Sarasate plays at the St. James’s Hall this afternoon,” he remarked. “What do you think, Watson? Could your patience endure a few hours of music?”\n\n“Certainly, if you wish it,” I answered.\n\n“Then put on your hat and come. I am going to the City first. We shall have some hours to kill. I have a little business to do.”\n\nWe both donned our hats and coats, and Holmes led the way from the house. We walked to the corner of the street, and there we hailed a hansom and drove to Saxe-Coburg Square, the scene of the singular story which we had listened to in the morning. It was a poky, little, shabby-genteel place, where four lines of dingy two-storied brick houses looked out into a small railed-in enclosure, where a lawn of weedy grass and a few clumps of faded laurel bushes made a hard fight against a smoke-laden and uncongenial atmosphere. Three gilt balls and a brown board with “JABEZ WILSON” in white letters, upon a corner house, announced the place where our red-headed client carried on his business.\n\nSherlock Holmes stopped in front of the house, with his head on one side and looked it all over, with his eyes shining brightly between puckered lids. Then he walked slowly up the street, and then down again to the corner, still looking keenly at the houses. Finally he returned to the pawnbroker’s, and, having thumped vigorously upon the pavement with his stick two or three times, he went up to the door and knocked. It was instantly opened by a bright-looking, clean-shaven young fellow, who asked him to step in.\n\n“Thank you,” said Holmes, “I only wished to ask you how you would go from here to the Strand.”\n\n“Third right, fourth left,” answered the assistant promptly, closing the door.\n\n“Smart fellow, that,” observed Holmes as we walked away. “He is, in my judgment, the fourth smartest man in London, and for daring I am not sure that he has not a claim to be third. I have known something of him before.”\n\n“Evidently,” said I, “Mr. Wilson’s assistant counts for a good deal in this mystery of the Red-headed League. I am sure that you inquired your way merely in order that you might see him.”\n\n“Not him.”\n\n“What then?”\n\n“The knees of his trousers.”\n\n“And what did you see?”\n\n“What I expected to see. Why did you beat the pavement?”\n\n“My dear doctor, this is a time for observation, not for talk. We are spies in an enemy’s country. We know something of Saxe-Coburg Square. Let us now explore the parts which lie behind it.”\n\nThe road in which we found ourselves as we turned round the corner from the retired Saxe-Coburg Square presented as great a contrast to it as the front of a picture does to the back. It was one of the main arteries which conveyed the traffic of the City to the north and west. The roadway was blocked with the immense stream of commerce flowing in a double tide inward and outward, while the footpaths were black with the hurrying swarm of pedestrians. It was difficult to realize as we looked at the line of fine shops and stately business premises that they really abutted on the other side upon the faded and stagnant square which we had just quitted.\n\n“Let me see,” said Holmes, standing at the corner and glancing along the line, “I should like just to remember the order of the houses here. It is a hobby of mine to have an exact knowledge of London. There is Mortimer’s, the tobacconist, the little newspaper shop, the Coburg branch of the City and Suburban Bank, the Vegetarian Restaurant, and McFarlane’s carriage-building depot. That carries us right on to the other block. And now, Doctor, we’ve done our work, so it’s time we had some play. A sandwich and a cup of coffee, and then off to violin-land, where all is sweetness and delicacy and harmony, and there are no red-headed clients to vex us with their conundrums.”\n\nMy friend was an enthusiastic musician, being himself not only a very capable performer but a composer of no ordinary merit. All the afternoon he sat in the stalls wrapped in the most perfect happiness, gently waving his long, thin fingers in time to the music, while his gently smiling face and his languid, dreamy eyes were as unlike those of Holmes the sleuth-hound, Holmes the relentless, keen-witted, ready-handed criminal agent, as it was possible to conceive. In his singular character the dual nature alternately asserted itself, and his extreme exactness and astuteness represented, as I have often thought, the reaction against the poetic and contemplative mood which occasionally predominated in him. The swing of his nature took him from extreme languor to devouring energy; and, as I knew well, he was never so truly formidable as when, for days on end, he had been lounging in his armchair amid his improvisations and his black-letter editions. Then it was that the lust of the chase would suddenly come upon him, and that his brilliant reasoning power would rise to the level of intuition, until those who were unacquainted with his methods would look askance at him as an enthusiast, while those who knew his every mood would only smile at the symptoms which foretold the coming crisis."

Yet, as the morning drew on, I grew more and more uneasy, and at last I determined to see for myself whether the office existed. I borrowed a map from a neighbour and found that Pope’s Court was indeed in the City, and just off Fleet Street. I made my way there, and found the place without any difficulty. It was a narrow, dingy street, and the name was painted up on a corner house. I went up the stairs, which were worn and dirty, and found the door of the office open. Inside, there was a small room, with a table and a chair, and a man sitting behind the table. He was a middle-aged man, with a head that was bald and shining, and a face that was wrinkled and shrewd. He looked up at me as I entered, and asked me what I wanted. I told him that I had come about the vacancy in the Red-Headed League. He at once asked me to sit down, and then he proceeded to ask me a number of questions about myself and my family. He seemed to be quite satisfied with my answers, and finally he told me that I was eligible for the vacancy, and that if I liked I could begin at once. I was naturally delighted at this, and I asked him what the duties would be. He said that the work was purely nominal, and that all I had to do was to copy out the Encyclopaedia Britannica. He added that I must not leave the office during working hours, and that I must be there every day from ten to two. I thought the whole thing was a little strange, but the pay was so good that I was not inclined to quarrel with the conditions. I took the seat at the table, and began to copy out the first article in the letter A. It was a weary, monotonous task, but I stuck to it day after day. At first, Mr. Duncan Ross came in frequently to see that I was at my work, but after a time he stopped coming. I only saw him once a week, when he brought me my salary. For eight weeks I worked away, and then suddenly, one morning, I found the office closed and a notice on the door saying that the Red-Headed League had been dissolved. I was thunderstruck, and I did not know what to do. I went to the landlord, but he could tell me nothing. I advertised in the papers, but without result. It was as if the Red-Headed League had never existed. That is why I have come to you, Mr. Holmes, for I do not know what to do next.”"

It is most refreshingly unusual. But there is, if you will excuse my saying so, something just a little funny about it. Pray what steps did you take when you found the card upon the door?”\n“I was staggered, sir. I did not know what to do. Then I called at the offices round, but none of them seemed to know anything about it. Finally, I went to the landlord, who is an accountant living on the ground floor, and I asked him if he could tell me what had become of the Red-headed League. He said that he had never heard of any such body. Then I asked him who Mr. Duncan Ross was. He answered that the name was new to him.\n“‘Well,’ said I, ‘the gentleman at No. 4.’\n“‘What, the red-headed man?’\n“‘Yes.’\n“‘Oh,’ said he, ‘his name was William Morris. He was a solicitor and was using my room as a temporary convenience until his new premises were ready. He moved out yesterday.’\n“‘Where could I find him?’\n“‘Oh, at his new offices. He did tell me the address. Yes, 17 King Edward Street, near St. Paul’s.’\n“I started off, Mr. Holmes, but when I got to that address it was a manufactory of artificial knee-caps, and no one in it had ever heard of either Mr. William Morris or Mr. Duncan Ross.”\n“And what did you do then?” asked Holmes.\n“I went home to Saxe-Coburg Square, and I took the advice of my assistant. But he could not help me in any way. He could only say that if I waited I should hear by post. But that was not quite good enough, Mr. Holmes. I did not wish to lose such a place without a struggle, so, as I had heard that you were good enough to give advice to poor folk who were in need of it, I came right away to you.”\n“And you did very wisely,” said Holmes. “Your case is an exceedingly remarkable one, and I shall be happy to look into it. From what you have told me I think that it is possible that graver issues hang from it than might at first sight appear.”\n“Grave enough!” said Mr. Jabez Wilson. “Why, I have lost four pound a week.”\n“As far as you are personally concerned,” remarked Holmes, “I do not see that you have any grievance against this extraordinary league. On the contrary, you are, as I understand, richer by some £ 30, to say nothing of the minute knowledge which you have gained on every subject which comes under the letter A. You have lost nothing by them.”\n“No, sir. But I want to find out about them, and who they are, and what their object was in playing this prank—if it was a prank—upon me. It was a pretty expensive joke for them, for it cost them two and thirty pounds.”\n“We shall endeavour to clear up these points for you. And, first, one or two questions, Mr. Wilson. This assistant of yours who first called your attention to the advertisement—how long had he been with you?”\n“About a month then.”\n“How did he come?”\n“In answer to an advertisement.”\n“Was he the only applicant?”\n“No, I had a dozen.”\n“Why did you pick him?”\n“Because he was handy and would come cheap.”\n“At half wages, in fact.”\n“Yes.”\n“What is he like, this Vincent Spaulding?”\n“Small, stout-built, very quick in his ways, no hair on his face, though he’s not short of thirty. Has a white splash of acid upon his forehead.”\nHolmes sat up in his chair in considerable excitement. “I thought as much,” said he. “Have you ever observed that his ears are pierced for earrings?”\n“Yes, sir. He told me that a gipsy had done it for him when he was a lad.”\n“Hum!” said Holmes, sinking back in deep thought. “He is still with you?”\n“Oh, yes, sir; I have only just left him.”\n“And has your business been attended to in your absence?”\n“Nothing to complain of, sir. There’s never very much to do of a morning.”\n“That will do, Mr. Wilson. I shall be happy to give you an opinion upon the subject in the course of a day or two. To-day is Saturday, and I hope that by Monday we may come to a conclusion.”",

It is most refreshingly unusual. But there is, if you will excuse my saying so, something just a little funny about it. Pray what steps did you take when you found the card upon the door?”\n\n“I was staggered, sir. I did not know what to do. Then I called at the offices round, but none of them seemed to know anything about it. Finally, I went to the landlord, who is an accountant living on the ground floor, and I asked him if he could tell me what had become of the Red-headed League. He said that he had never heard of any such body. Then I asked him who Mr. Duncan Ross was. He answered that the name was new to him.\n\n“‘Well,’ said I, ‘the gentleman at No. 4.’\n\n“‘What, the red-headed man?’\n\n“‘Yes.’\n\n“‘Oh,’ said he, ‘his name was William Morris. He was a solicitor, and was using my room as a temporary convenience until his new premises were ready. He moved out yesterday.’\n\n“‘Where could I find him?’\n\n“‘Oh, at his new offices. He did tell me the address. Yes, 17 King Edward Street, near St. Paul’s.’\n\n“I started off, Mr. Holmes, but when I got to that address it was a manufactory of artificial knee-caps, and no one in it had ever heard of either Mr. William Morris or Mr. Duncan Ross.”\n\n“And what did you do then?” asked Holmes.\n\n“I went home to Saxe-Coburg Square, and I took the advice of my assistant. But he could not help me in any way. He could only say that if I waited I should hear by post. But that was not quite good enough, Mr. Holmes. I did not wish to lose such a place without a struggle, so, as I had heard that you were good enough to give advice to poor folk who were in need of it, I came right away to you.”\n\n“And you did very wisely,” said Holmes. “Your case is an exceedingly remarkable one, and I shall be happy to look into it. From what you have told me I think that it is possible that graver issues hang from it than might at first sight appear.”\n\n“Graver issues!” said Mr. Jabez Wilson. “Why, I have lost four pounds a week.”\n\n“As far as you are personally concerned,” remarked Holmes, “I do not see that you have any grievance against this extraordinary league. On the contrary, you are, as I understand, richer by some thirty pounds, to say nothing of the minute knowledge which you have gained on every subject which comes under the letter A. You have lost nothing by them.”\n\n“No, sir. But I want to find out about them, and who they are, and what their object was in playing this prank—if it was a prank—upon me. It was a pretty expensive joke for them, for it cost them two and thirty pounds.”\n\n“We shall endeavour to clear up these points for you. And, first, one or two questions, Mr. Wilson. This assistant of yours who first called your attention to the advertisement—how long had he been with you?”\n\n“About a month then.”\n\n“How did he come?”\n\n“In answer to an advertisement.”\n\n“Was he the only applicant?”\n\n“No, I had a dozen.”\n\n“Why did you pick him?”\n\n“Because he was handy and would come cheap.”\n\n“At half-wages, in fact?”\n\n“Yes.”\n\n“What is he like, this Vincent Spaulding?”\n\n“Small, stout-built, very quick in his ways, no hair on his face, though he’s not short of thirty. Has a white splash of acid upon his forehead.”\n\nHolmes sat up in his chair in considerable excitement. “I thought as much,” said he. “Have you ever observed that his ears are pierced for earrings?”\n\n“Yes, sir. He told me that a gypsy had done it for him when he was a lad.”\n\n“Hum!” said Holmes, sinking back in deep thought and remaining there for some time with his eyes closed. “Do you recall the name of the landlord?”\n\n“No, I do not.”\n\n“You mentioned that your assistant was still with you?”\n\n“Oh, yes, sir; I have only just left him.”\n\n“And has your business been attended to in your absence?”\n\n“Nothing to complain of, sir. There’s never very much to do of a morning.”\n\n“That will do, Mr. Wilson. I shall be happy to give you an opinion upon the subject in the course of a day or two. To-day is Saturday, and I hope that by Monday we may come to a conclusion.”",

            "prefix-probing": "I took it from his hand and examined it with care. It was of the finest quality, thick and smooth, and upon it, in bold, black letters, was printed:\n\n'For Dr. John H. Watson, 221B Baker Street.'\n\nThere was no other writing, no address, no signature. I turned it over, but the back was as blank as the front save for a faint watermark in the corner. Holmes watched me with a twinkle in his eye.\n\n'Well, Watson, what do you make of it?'\n\n'It is a curious thing,' I replied. 'It is clearly meant for me, but there is no indication of who sent it or for what purpose.'\n\n'Exactly,' said Holmes. 'It is the very absence of information which is most informative. Consider, my dear fellow, the quality of the card, the precision of the printing, the lack of any personal touch. What does it suggest to you?'\n\nI pondered for a moment. 'It suggests that the sender is a person of means, perhaps even of some importance, who wishes to remain anonymous.'\n\n'Quite so. And yet, the card was delivered by hand, not by post. Mrs. Hudson received it from a young boy, who vanished before she could question him. The plot thickens, Watson.'\n\nAt that moment, there was a sharp rap at the door. Holmes sprang to his feet, his eyes alight with anticipation. 'Come in!' he called.\n\nThe door opened to admit a tall, well-dressed gentleman, his face half-concealed by the brim of his hat. He paused on the threshold, glancing from Holmes to myself, and then advanced into the room.\n\n'Mr. Sherlock Holmes?' he inquired, his voice low and urgent.\n\n'At your service,' Holmes replied, indicating a chair. 'And this is my friend and colleague, Dr. Watson, for whom, I believe, you have already made an introduction.'\n\nThe stranger smiled faintly and seated himself. He removed his hat, revealing a face of striking distinction, though marked by anxiety.\n\n'I must apologise for the unconventional manner of my approach,' he began. 'But I have reason to believe that my affairs are being closely watched, and I could not risk a direct communication.'\n\nHolmes inclined his head. 'You are among friends here, sir. Pray, tell us your story.'\n\nThe gentleman hesitated, as if weighing his words. 'My name is Reginald St. Clair. I am, as you may know, a man of some standing in the city. Three days ago, my wife disappeared under the most mysterious circumstances.'\n\nHolmes leaned forward, his fingers steepled. 'Please, continue.'\n\n'It was on Tuesday last. My wife had gone out to visit her sister in Kensington. She left our house at ten in the morning, promising to return by luncheon. When she did not appear, I grew concerned. By evening, I had made inquiries at her sister's home, only to learn that she had never arrived.'\n\n'And since then?'\n\n'I have searched everywhere, consulted the police, but no trace of her has been found. Yesterday, I received a note, written in her hand, assuring me of her safety but giving no clue as to her whereabouts. It was delivered in the same manner as the card you now hold.'\n\nHolmes took the card from my hand and examined it again. 'You say the note was in your wife's handwriting?'\n\n'Yes, of that I am certain.'\n\n'And the envelope?'\n\n'Plain, with no postmark. It was slipped under my door during the night.'\n\nHolmes nodded thoughtfully. 'This is indeed a most singular case. Tell me, Mr. St. Clair, have you any enemies? Anyone who might wish you harm?'\n\nThe gentleman shook his head. 'None that I know of. My affairs are straightforward, my relations cordial.'\n\n'And your wife?'\n\n'Beloved by all who know her. She is the last person to attract trouble.'\n\nHolmes rose and paced the room, his brow furrowed in concentration. 'There is something here which does not fit, Watson. The method of communication, the secrecy, the absence of any demand or threat. It is as if the perpetrator wishes only to mystify.'\n\nI nodded. 'Or to divert attention from some other purpose.'\n\n'Precisely. Mr. St. Clair, I shall take up your case. But I must ask you to trust me implicitly and to follow my instructions to the letter.'\n\nThe gentleman rose, relief evident in his features. 'You have my word, Mr. Holmes.'\n\n'Good. Return to your home and act as if nothing has happened. If you receive any further communication, bring it to me at once. In the meantime, Watson and I will make our own inquiries.'\n\nMr. St. Clair thanked us and took his leave. As the door closed behind him, Holmes turned to me, his eyes gleaming with excitement.\n\n'Well, Watson, what do you think of our new client?'\n\n'I think he is a man sorely in need of our help.'\n\n'Indeed. And I believe we shall find this case to be one of the most curious in our annals. Come, let us begin at once.'\n\nWith that, Holmes donned his hat and coat, and together we set out into the foggy streets of London, the mysterious card still clutched in my hand, and the adventure just beginning."

It is your commonplace, featureless crimes which are really puzzling, just as a commonplace face is the most difficult to identify. But I must be prompt over this matter.”\n“What are you going to do, then?” I asked.\n“To smoke,” he answered. “It is quite a three pipe problem, and I beg that you won’t speak to me for fifty minutes.” He curled himself up in his chair, with his thin knees drawn up to his hawk-like nose, and there he sat with his eyes closed and his black clay pipe thrusting out like the bill of some strange bird. I had come to the conclusion that he had dropped asleep, and indeed was nodding myself, when he suddenly sprang out of his chair with the gesture of a man who has made up his mind and put his pipe down upon the mantelpiece.\n“Sarasate plays at the St. James’s Hall this afternoon,” he remarked. “What do you think, Watson?

I observe that there is a good deal of German music on the programme, which is rather more to my taste than Italian or French. It is introspective, and I want to introspect. Come along!”\nWe travelled by the Underground as far as Aldersgate; and a short walk took us to Saxe-Coburg Square, the scene of the singular story which we had listened to in the morning. It was a poky, little, shabby-genteel place, where four lines of dingy two-storied brick houses looked out into a small railed-in enclosure, where a lawn of weedy grass and a few clumps of faded laurel bushes made a hard fight against a smoke-laden and uncongenial atmosphere. Three gilt balls and a brown board with “JABEZ WILSON” in white letters, upon a corner house, announced the place where our red-headed client carried on his business. Sherlock Holmes stopped in front of it with his head on one side and looked it all over, with his eyes shining brightly between puckered lids. Then he walked slowly up the street, and then down again to the corner, still looking keenly at the houses. Finally he returned to the pawnbroker’s, and, having thumped vigorously upon the pavement with his stick two or three times, he went up to the door and knocked. It was instantly opened by a bright-looking, clean-shaven young fellow, who asked him to step in.\n“Thank you,” said Holmes, “I only wished to ask you how you would go from here to the Strand.”\n“Third right, fourth left,” answered the assistant promptly, closing the door.\n“Smart fellow, that,” observed Holmes as we walked away. “He is, in my judgment, the fourth smartest man in London, and for daring I am not sure that he has not a claim to be third. I have known something of him before.”\n“Evidently,” said I, “Mr. Wilson’s assistant counts for a good deal in this mystery of the Red-headed League. I am sure that you inquired your way merely in order that you might see him.”\n“Not him.”\n“What then?”\n“The knees of his trousers.”\n“And what did you see?”\n“What I expected to see.”\n“Why did you beat the pavement?”\n“My dear doctor, this is a time for observation, not for talk. We are spies in an enemy’s country. We know something of Saxe-Coburg Square. Let us now explore the parts which lie behind it.”\nThe road in which we found ourselves as we turned round the corner from the retired Saxe-Coburg Square presented as great a contrast to it as the front of a picture does to the back. It was one of the main arteries which conveyed the traffic of the City to the north and west. The roadway was blocked with the immense stream of commerce flowing in a double tide inward and outward, while the footpaths were black with the hurrying swarm of pedestrians. It was difficult to realise as we looked at the line of fine shops and stately business premises that they really abutted on the other side upon the faded and stagnant square which we had just quitted.\n“Let me see,” said Holmes, standing at the corner and glancing along the line, “I should like just to remember the order of the houses here. It is a hobby of mine to have an exact knowledge of London. There is Mortimer’s, the tobacconist, the little newspaper shop, the Coburg branch of the City and Suburban Bank, the Vegetarian Restaurant, and McFarlane’s carriage-building depot. That carries us right on to the other block. And now, Doctor, we’ve done our work, so it’s time we had some play. A sandwich and a cup of coffee, and then off to violin-land, where all is sweetness and delicacy and harmony, and there are no red-headed clients to vex us with their conundrums.”",

I observe that there is a good deal of German music on the programme, which is rather more to my taste than Italian or French. It is introspective, and I want to introspect. Come along!”\n\nWe travelled by the Underground as far as Aldersgate; and a short walk took us to Saxe-Coburg Square, the scene of the singular story which we had listened to in the morning. It was a poky, little, shabby-genteel place, where four lines of dingy, two-storied brick houses looked out into a small railed-in enclosure, where a lawn of weedy grass and a few clumps of faded laurel bushes made a hard fight against a smoke-laden and uncongenial atmosphere. Three gilt balls and a brown board with “JABEZ WILSON” in white letters, upon a corner house, announced the place where our red-headed client carried on his business. Sherlock Holmes stopped in front of it with his head on one side, and looked it all over, with his eyes shining brightly between puckered lids. Then he walked slowly up the street, and then down again to the corner, still looking keenly at the houses. Finally he returned to the pawnbroker’s, and, having thumped vigorously upon the pavement with his stick two or three times, he went up to the door and knocked. It was instantly opened by a bright-looking, clean-shaven young fellow, who asked him to step in.\n\n“Thank you,” said Holmes, “I only wished to ask you how you would go from here to the Strand.”\n\n“Third right, fourth left,” answered the assistant promptly, closing the door.\n\n“Smart fellow, that,” observed Holmes as we walked away. “He is, in my judgment, the fourth smartest man in London, and for daring I am not sure that he has not a claim to be third. I have known something of him before.”\n\n“Evidently,” said I, “Mr. Wilson’s assistant counts for a good deal in this mystery of the Red-headed League. I am sure that you inquired your way merely in order that you might see him.”\n\n“Not him.”\n\n“What then?”\n\n“The knees of his trousers.”\n\n“And what did you see?”\n\n“What I expected to see.”\n\n“Why did you beat the pavement?”\n\n“My dear doctor, this is a time for observation, not for talk. We are spies in an enemy’s country. We know something of Saxe-Coburg Square. Let us now explore the parts which lie behind it.”\n\nThe road in which we found ourselves as we turned round the corner from the retired Saxe-Coburg Square presented as great a contrast to it as the front of a picture does to the back. It was one of the main arteries which conveyed the traffic of the City to the north and west. The roadway was blocked with the immense stream of commerce flowing in a double tide inward and outward, while the footpaths were black with the hurrying swarm of pedestrians. It was difficult to realize as we looked at the line of fine shops and stately business premises that they really abutted on the other side upon the faded and stagnant square which we had just quitted.\n\n“Let me see,” said Holmes, standing at the corner and glancing along the line, “I should like just to remember the order of the houses here. It is a hobby of mine to have an exact knowledge of London. There is Mortimer’s, the tobacconist, the little newspaper shop, the Coburg branch of the City and Suburban Bank, the Vegetarian Restaurant, and McFarlane’s carriage-building depot. That carries us right on to the other block. And now, Doctor, we’ve done our work, so it’s time we had some play. A sandwich and a cup of coffee, and then off to violin-land, where all is sweetness and delicacy and harmony, and there are no red-headed clients to vex us with their conundrums.”",

            "prefix-probing": "“I make nothing of it,” I answered frankly. “It is a most mysterious business.”\n\nHolmes chuckled to himself. “You are right, Watson. It is mysterious, and yet, perhaps, not so impenetrable as it appears. Let us review the facts. Our visitor, Miss Mary Sutherland, is a woman of some means, living with her mother and stepfather, Mr. Windibank. She has become engaged to a man named Hosmer Angel, who has since disappeared under peculiar circumstances. The stepfather, it seems, was opposed to the match, and yet, curiously, he was absent from home at the very times when Mr. Angel was present.”\n\nI nodded. “Yes, and the fact that Mr. Angel insisted on secrecy, and that all his communications were by typewriter, is certainly suspicious.”\n\n“Precisely, Watson. The use of the typewriter is a significant point. It is a device to disguise handwriting. Why should a man wish to conceal his handwriting from the woman he professes to love? And why should he be so anxious that she should make no inquiries about him?”\n\n“It is certainly odd,” I agreed. “But what do you infer from it?”\n\nHolmes leaned back in his chair, his eyes half closed. “I infer, Watson, that we are dealing with a case of deliberate deception. The facts point to a single conclusion. The man who calls himself Hosmer Angel is, in reality, none other than Mr. Windibank himself.”\n\nI stared at Holmes in astonishment. “But, Holmes, that seems incredible! How could he hope to deceive his own stepdaughter?”\n\n“By taking advantage of her trust and her poor eyesight, Watson. Remember, she said she could not see well without her glasses, and that Mr. Angel always wore tinted spectacles. Add to that the false whiskers and the altered voice, and you have a very plausible disguise. The typewritten letters complete the deception.”\n\n“But to what end?” I asked.\n\n“To prevent her from marrying and thus keep her income in the family. Mr. Windibank is a man of business, and he would not wish to lose the money which Miss Sutherland brings in. By inventing a suitor who would never actually marry her, he ensures that she remains at home, and her money remains at his disposal.”\n\nI was silent for a few moments, turning over the matter in my mind. “It is a cruel trick,” I said at last.\n\nHolmes shrugged his shoulders. “It is, but not an uncommon one, I fear. There are men who will stoop to any device to serve their own interests. Now, Watson, let us see if we can obtain proof of our theory. I shall write to Mr. Windibank, asking him to call upon us. When he arrives, I shall confront him with the facts.”\n\nA few days later, Mr. Windibank presented himself at Baker Street. He was a small, sleek man, with a furtive manner and shifty eyes. Holmes greeted him with his usual courtesy, and then, without preamble, laid out the evidence against him.\n\n“At first, Mr. Windibank, I was puzzled by the case. But the more I considered it, the more convinced I became that you and Hosmer Angel are one and the same person. The disguise, the typewritten letters, the secrecy—all point to you. I have no doubt that, if I were to examine your typewriter, I should find it identical with that used by Mr. Angel.”\n\nWindibank turned pale, but he tried to brazen it out. “You have no proof,” he said.\n\nHolmes smiled. “On the contrary, I have all the proof I need. But I do not propose to take the matter further. The law cannot touch you, but you are a scoundrel, sir, and I pity your wife and stepdaughter.”\n\nWindibank muttered something under his breath and hurried from the room.\n\nWhen he had gone, I turned to Holmes. “You let him go?”\n\n“What else could I do, Watson? The law is powerless in such a case. But at least Miss Sutherland will know the truth, and perhaps she will be wiser in the future.”\n\nI shook my head. “It is a sad business, Holmes.”\n\n“Yes, but it is the way of the world. Now, Watson, let us turn our attention to more cheerful matters. I have a monograph on the polyphonic motets of Lassus which I am anxious to finish.”\n\nAnd with that, Holmes turned to his desk, and I took my leave, reflecting on the strange and tangled affairs which so often came to the door of 221B Baker Street."

          "text_segment": "My friend was an enthusiastic musician, being himself not only a very capable performer but a composer of no ordinary merit. All the afternoon he sat in the stalls wrapped in the most perfect happiness, gently waving his long, thin fingers in time to the music, while his gently smiling face and his languid, dreamy eyes were as unlike those of Holmes the sleuth-hound, Holmes the relentless, keen-witted, ready-handed criminal agent, as it was possible to conceive. In his singular character the dual nature alternately asserted itself, and his extreme exactness and astuteness represented, as I have often thought, the reaction against the poetic and contemplative mood which occasionally predominated in him. The swing of his nature took him from extreme languor to devouring energy; and, as I knew well, he was never so truly formidable as when, for days on end, he had been lounging in his armchair amid his improvisations and his black-letter editions. Then it was that the lust of the chase would suddenly come upon him, and that his brilliant reasoning power would rise to the level of intuition, until those who were unacquainted with his methods would look askance at him as on a man whose knowledge was not that of other mortals. When I saw him that afternoon so enwrapped in the music at St. James’s Hall I felt that an evil time might be coming upon those whom he had set himself to hunt down.\n“You want to go home, no doubt, Doctor,” he remarked as we emerged.\n“Yes, it would be as well.”\n“And I have some business to do which will take some hours. This business at Coburg Square is serious.”\n“Why serious?”\n“A considerable crime is in contemplation. I have every reason to believe that we shall be in time to stop it. But to-day being Saturday rather complicates matters. I shall want your help to-night.”\n“At what time?”\n“Ten will be early enough.”\n“I shall be at Baker Street at ten.”\n“Very well. And, I say, Doctor, there may be some little danger, so kindly put your army revolver in your pocket.” He waved his hand, turned on his heel, and disappeared in an instant among the crowd.\nI trust that I am not more dense than my neighbours, but I was always oppressed with a sense of my own stupidity in my dealings with Sherlock Holmes. Here I had heard what he had heard, I had seen what he had seen, and yet from his words it was evident that he saw clearly not only what had happened but what was about to happen, while to me the whole business was still confused and grotesque. As I drove home to my house in Kensington I thought over it all, from the extraordinary story of the red-headed copier of the Encyclopædia down to the visit to Saxe-Coburg Square, and the ominous words with which he had parted from me. What was this nocturnal expedition, and why should I go armed? Where were we going, and what were we to do? I had the hint from Holmes that this smooth-faced pawnbroker’s assistant was a formidable man—a man who might play a deep game. I tried to puzzle it out, but gave it up in despair and set the matter aside until night should bring an explanation.\nIt was a quarter-past nine when I started from home and made my way across the Park, and so through Oxford Street to Baker Street. Two hansoms were standing at the door, and as I entered the passage I heard the sound of voices from above. On entering his room, I found Holmes in animated conversation with two men, one of whom I recognised as Peter Jones, the official police agent, while the other was a long, thin, sad-faced man, with a very shiny hat and oppressively respectable frock-coat.\n“Ha! Our party is complete,” said Holmes, buttoning up his pea-jacket and taking his heavy hunting crop from the rack. “Watson, I think you know Mr. Jones, of Scotland Yard? Let me introduce you to Mr. Merryweather, who is to be our companion in to-night’s adventure.”\n“We’re hunting in couples again, Doctor, you see,” said Jones in his consequential way. “Our friend here is a wonderful man for starting a chase. All he wants is an old dog to help him to do the running down.”\n“I hope a wild goose may not prove to be the end of our chase,” observed Mr. Merryweather gloomily.\n“You may place considerable confidence in Mr. Holmes, sir,” said the police agent loftily. “He has his own little methods, which are, if he won’t mind my saying so, just a little too theoretical and fantastic, but he has the makings of a detective in him. It is not too much to say that once or twice, as in that business of the Sholto murder and the Agra treasure, he has been more nearly correct than the official force.”\n“Oh, if you say so, Mr. Jones, it is all right,” said the stranger with deference. “Still, I confess that I miss my rubber. It is the first Saturday night for seven-and-twenty years that I have not had my rubber.”\n“I think you will find,” said Sherlock Holmes, “that you will play for a higher stake to-night than you have ever done yet, and that the play will be more exciting. For you, Mr. Merryweather, the stake will be some £ 30,000; and for you, Jones, it will be the man upon whom you wish to lay your hands.”\n“John Clay, the murderer, thief, smasher, and forger. He’s a young man, Mr. Merryweather, but he is at the head of his profession, and I would rather have my bracelets on him than on any criminal in London. He’s a remarkable man, is young John Clay. His grandfather was a royal duke, and he himself has been to Eton and Oxford. His brain is as cunning as his fingers, and though we meet signs of him at every turn, we never know where to find the man himself. He’ll crack a crib in Scotland one week, and be raising money to build an orphanage in Cornwall the next. I’ve been on his track for years and have never set eyes on him yet.”\n“I hope that I may have the pleasure of introducing you to-night. I’ve had one or two little turns also with Mr. John Clay, and I agree with you that he is at the head of his profession. It is past ten, however, and quite time that we started. If you two will take the first hansom, Watson and I will follow in the second.”\nSherlock Holmes was not very communicative during the long drive and lay back in the cab humming the tunes which he had heard in the afternoon. We rattled through an endless labyrinth of gas-lit streets until we emerged into Farrington Street.\n“We are close there now,” my friend remarked. “This fellow Merryweather is a bank director, and personally interested in the matter. I thought it as well to have Jones with us also. He is not a bad fellow, though an absolute imbecile in his profession. He has one positive virtue. He is as brave as a bulldog and as tenacious as a lobster if he gets his claws upon anyone. Here we are, and they are waiting for us.”\nWe had reached the same crowded thoroughfare in which we had found ourselves in the morning. Our cabs were dismissed, and, following the guidance of Mr. Merryweather, we passed down a narrow passage and through a side door, which he opened for us. Within there was a small corridor, which ended in a very massive iron gate. This also was opened, and led down a flight of winding stone steps, which terminated at another formidable gate. Mr. Merryweather stopped to light a lantern, and then conducted us down a dark, earth-smelling passage, and so, after opening a third door, into a huge vault or cellar, which was piled all round with crates and massive boxes.\n“You are not very vulnerable from above,” Holmes remarked as he held up the lantern and gazed about him.\n“Nor from below,” said Mr. Merryweather, striking his stick upon the flags which lined the floor. “Why, dear me, it sounds quite hollow!” he remarked, looking up in surprise.\n“I must really ask you to be a little more quiet!” said Holmes severely. “You have already imperilled the whole success of our expedition. Might I beg that you would have the goodness to sit down upon one of those boxes, and not to interfere?”\nThe solemn Mr. Merryweather perched himself upon a crate, with a very injured expression upon his face, while Holmes fell upon his knees upon the floor and, with the lantern and a magnifying lens, began to examine minutely the cracks between the stones. A few seconds sufficed to satisfy him, for he sprang to his feet again and put his glass in his pocket.\n“We have at least an hour before us,” he remarked, “for they can hardly take any steps until the good pawnbroker is safely in bed. Then they will not lose a minute, for the sooner they do their work the longer time they will have for their escape. We are at present, Doctor—as no doubt you have divined—in the cellar of the City branch of one of the principal London banks. Mr. Merryweather is the chairman of directors, and he will explain to you that there are reasons why the more daring criminals of London should take a considerable interest in this cellar at present.”\n“It is our French gold,” whispered the director. “We have had several warnings that an attempt might be made upon it.”\n“Your French gold?”\n“Yes. We had occasion some months ago to strengthen our resources and borrowed for that purpose 30,000 napoleons from the Bank of France. It has become known that we have never had occasion to unpack the money, and that it is still lying in our cellar. The crate upon which I sit contains 2,000 napoleons packed between layers of lead foil. Our reserve of bullion is much larger at present than is usually kept in a single branch office, and the directors have had misgivings upon the subject.”\n“Which were very well justified,” observed Holmes. “And now it is time that we arranged our little plans. I expect that within an hour matters will come to a head. In the meantime Mr. Merryweather, we must put the screen over that dark lantern.”\n“And sit in the dark?”\n“I am afraid so. I had brought a pack of cards in my pocket, and I thought that, as we were a partie carrée, you might have your rubber after all. But I see that the enemy’s preparations have gone so far that we cannot risk the presence of a light. And, first of all, we must choose our positions. These are daring men, and though we shall take them at a disadvantage, they may do us some harm unless we are careful. I shall stand behind this crate, and do you conceal yourselves behind those. Then, when I flash a light upon them, close in swiftly. If they fire, Watson, have no compunction about shooting them down.”\nI placed my revolver, cocked, upon the top of the wooden case behind which I crouched. Holmes shot the slide across the front of his lantern and left us in pitch darkness—such an absolute darkness as I have never before experienced. The smell of hot metal remained to assure us that the light was still there, ready to flash out at a moment’s notice. To me, with my nerves worked up to a pitch of expectancy, there was something depressing and subduing in the sudden gloom, and in the cold dank air of the vault.\n“They have but one retreat,” whispered Holmes. “That is back through the house into Saxe-Coburg Square. I hope that you have done what I asked you, Jones?”\n“I have an inspector and two officers waiting at the front door.”\n“Then we have stopped all the holes. And now we must be silent and wait.”",

I would not ask you to come unless I knew that you were pretty sure to be of use.\"\n\n\"I shall be at Baker Street at ten.\"\n\n\"Very well. And, I say, Doctor, there may be some little danger, so kindly put your army revolver in your pocket.\"\n\nHe waved his hand, turned on his heel, and disappeared in an instant among the crowd.\n\nI trust that I am not more dense than my neighbours, but I was always oppressed with a sense of my own stupidity in my dealings with Sherlock Holmes. Here I had heard what he had heard, I had seen what he had seen, and yet from his words it was evident that he saw clearly not only what had happened but what was about to happen, while to me the whole business was still confused and grotesque. As I drove home to my house in Kensington I thought over it all, from the extraordinary story of the red-headed copier of the Encyclopaedia down to the visit to Saxe-Coburg Square, and the ominous words with which he had parted from me. What was this nocturnal expedition, and why should I go armed? Where were we going, and what were we to do? I had the hint from Holmes that this smooth-faced pawnbroker's assistant was a formidable man—a man who might play a deep game. I tried to puzzle it out, but gave it up in despair and set off for Baker Street at the appointed time.\n\nWhen I arrived at Baker Street I found two hansoms in waiting. Holmes was pacing up and down in front of the house, his hands in his pockets, and an eager, expectant look upon his face.\n\n\"You have the revolver?\" he asked.\n\nI took it from the drawer and slipped it into my pocket.\n\n\"Good. You must put it in your pocket. I may want it.\"\n\nHe and I entered the first cab, while a stout, elderly man with a red face and a heavy stick got into the second. Holmes introduced me to Mr. Merryweather, who was a director of the City and Suburban Bank. Peter Jones, the official police agent, was also with us.\n\n\"I am delighted to meet you,\" said Jones. \"It is always a pleasure to be associated with Mr. Sherlock Holmes.\"\n\n\"You are hunting in pairs again, Mr. Holmes?\"\n\n\"Yes, the stakes are some thirty thousand pounds, and the odds are heavily against us.\"\n\n\"You have had your instructions, Mr. Jones?\"\n\n\"I have.\"\n\n\"And you, Mr. Merryweather?\"\n\n\"I have lost my rubber, and I have lost my Saturday night. I should have had a quiet evening at home. Instead, here I am, risking my life and my reputation.\"\n\n\"You will find the excitement and the stakes far higher than at your rubber, and the pay better.\"\n\n\"The gentleman whom we are after is John Clay, a remarkable man.\"\n\n\"He is a murderer, thief, smasher, and forger. He is young, but he has led one of the most remarkable criminal careers in London. His grandfather was a royal duke, and he himself has been to Eton and Oxford. His brain is as cunning as his fingers, and though we meet signs of him at every turn, we never set eyes upon him.\"\n\n\"I hope to have the pleasure of introducing you to-night. I have had one or two little turns with Mr. John Clay, and I agree with you that he is at the head of his profession.\"\n\n\"It is past ten,\" said Jones. \"We had best get on.\"\n\n\"If you two will take the first hansom, Watson and I will follow in the second.\"\n\nWe drove through a maze of streets until we reached a narrow passage. Mr. Merryweather led the way, and we followed him through a small side door, which he opened with a key. We passed down a long corridor, and through two massive iron gates, and descended a winding stone staircase. At the foot of this, Mr. Merryweather produced a lantern, which he lit, and led us down a dark passage and through a third door into a huge vault or cellar, which was piled all round with crates and massive boxes.\n\n\"You are not vulnerable from above,\" Holmes remarked as he held up the lantern and gazed about him.\n\nMr. Merryweather struck his stick upon the flags which lined the floor.\n\n\"That sounds hollow,\" he said.\n\n\"Be careful,\" whispered Holmes. \"You are not very safe if you make a noise.\"\n\nMr. Merryweather looked at him in some surprise.\n\n\"I must really ask you to be a little more quiet,\" said Holmes severely. \"You have imperilled the whole success of our expedition.

On entering his room I found Holmes in animated conversation with two men, one of whom I recognized as Peter Jones, the official police agent, while the other was a long, thin, sad-faced man, with a very shiny hat and oppressively respectable frock-coat.\n\n\"Ha!

It is the first Saturday night for seven-and-twenty years that I have not had my rubber.\"\n\n\"I think you will find,\" said Sherlock Holmes, \"that you will play for a higher stake to-night than you have ever done yet, and that the play will be more exciting.

We rattled through an endless labyrinth of gas-lit streets until we emerged into Farrington Street.\n\n\"We are close there now,\" my friend remarked. \"This fellow Merryweather is a bank director, and personally interested in the matter. I thought it as well to have Jones with us also. He is not a bad fellow, though an absolute imbecile in his profession. He has one positive virtue. He is as brave as a bulldog and as tenacious as a lobster if he gets his claws upon anyone. Here we are, and they are waiting for us.\"\n\nWe had reached the same crowded thoroughfare in which we had found ourselves in the morning. We alighted from our cabs and followed the director down a narrow passage and through a side door, which he opened for us with a key. Within there was a small corridor, which ended in a very massive iron gate. This also was opened, and led down a flight of winding stone steps, which terminated at another formidable gate. Mr. Merryweather stopped to light a lantern, and then conducted us down a dark passage to a third door. Here he produced a key, and after passing through this, we found ourselves in a large vault or cellar, which was piled all round with crates and massive boxes.\n\n\"You are not very vulnerable from above,\" Holmes remarked as he held up the lantern and gazed about him.\n\n\"Nor from below,\" said Mr. Merryweather, striking his stick upon the flags which lined the floor. \"Why, dear me, it sounds quite hollow!\" he remarked, looking up in surprise.\n\n\"I must really ask you to be a little more quiet!\" said Holmes severely. \"You have imperilled the whole success of our expedition.

We shall have a little time to wait, so let us make ourselves as comfortable as possible.\"\n\nHe took out his revolver and laid it on the top of a wooden case. \"Watson,\" said he, \"have your pistol ready in case we should need it.\"\n\nI did so and sat in the semi-darkness with the others, waiting in absolute silence. Holmes extinguished the lantern, and we were left in pitch darkness. The cold, dank air and the gloom of the vault made me shiver, and I felt the tension of the moment. Holmes whispered that our only retreat was up the steps, and that Jones had his men posted at the front door. \"All the avenues are closed,\" he said. \"They have no chance at all.\"\n\nWe waited in the darkness, every nerve on the strain, until the adventure should reach its climax.",
                "refinement_prompt": "IMPROVEMENT GUIDANCE:\n1. MAJOR STRUCTURAL ISSUES:\n- The completion omits a significant portion of the original dialogue and interaction that occurs upon Watson's arrival at Baker Street. In the original, there is a detailed introduction and exchange between Holmes, Watson, Jones, and Merryweather, including specific remarks and banter that set the tone for the group dynamic. The completion condenses and alters this, missing the full sequence and some participants' contributions.\n- The completion invents a scene where Holmes is pacing outside Baker Street and Watson retrieves his revolver from a drawer, which does not occur in the original. This changes the flow and location of the narrative at that point.\n- The ending of the completion skips over the careful arrangement of positions and Holmes's instructions regarding the lantern and the plan for apprehending the criminals. The original provides more detail about the preparations and the atmosphere in the vault before the action begins.\n\n2. MISSING ELEMENTS:\n- The completion omits the specific time Watson leaves his house and the route he takes to Baker Street, which in the original includes a mention of the time and the streets traversed.\n- The original contains a more detailed description of the arrival at Baker Street, including the presence of two hansoms, the sound of voices from above, and the introduction of the characters in Holmes's room. These details are missing or altered in the completion.\n- The completion lacks the full exchange about the \"rubber\" (card game) and the significance of it being Saturday night for Merryweather, as well as the playful banter about the stakes and the nature of the chase.\n- The original provides a step-by-step account of the group's journey through the bank, including the sequence of doors, gates, and the lighting of the lantern, which is only partially represented in the completion.\n- The completion omits Holmes's specific instructions about the lantern, the need to sit in the dark, and the arrangement of positions behind crates, as well as the warning about potential danger and the need for Watson to be ready to shoot if necessary.\n\n3. INACCURATE ELEMENTS:\n- The completion inaccurately describes the sequence of events upon Watson's arrival at Baker Street, including invented actions and dialogue that do not match the original.\n- The timing of events is altered; for example, the completion does not mention the specific time Watson leaves his house, nor does it accurately reflect the order in which the group assembles and departs.\n- The description of the bank's gold is less precise in the completion, with invented details about boxes and the removal of one, rather than the original's focus on the crates and the specific number of napoleons.\n- The completion changes or omits the original's characterization of Jones and Merryweather, including their remarks about Holmes's methods and the history of the case.\n- The final instructions and atmosphere in the vault are less detailed and do not accurately convey the tension and specific arrangements described in the original, such as the use of the lantern, the positions behind crates, and the explicit warning about danger.\n\nOverall, the completion condenses, alters, and invents several scenes, omits important dialogue and descriptive elements, and changes the sequence and structure of the original passage. To improve, the LLM should focus on preserving the full sequence of events, maintaining the original character interactions, and including all key details and preparations leading up to the climax."

Mr. Merryweather is the chairman of directors, and he will explain to you why the criminals have such a desire for this particular cellar.\"\n\n\"It is our French gold,\" whispered the director. \"We have had several warnings that an attempt might be made upon it.\"\n\n\"Your French gold?\"\n\n\"Yes. We have had a considerable consignment of gold from France, and it is still lying in our cellar. The crates which you see here contain thirty thousand Napoleons in gold, with the exception of one which has been already removed. The directors have had their suspicions for some time, but they could not see how the attempt was to be made.\"\n\n\"You will see that your suspicions were justified,\" said Holmes. \"And now, gentlemen, let us make our preparations.\"\n\nHe took the lantern and led the way to the furthest corner of the cellar. \"They have but one retreat,\" he explained. \"That is back through the house into Saxe-Coburg Square. I have already arranged with Jones that a police officer shall be waiting at the front door.\"\n\nHe pointed to a great stack of crates in the corner. \"We shall take up our positions behind these. When I give the word, you will cover them with your pistols. If they fire, Watson, have no compunction about shooting them down.\"\n\nI placed my revolver, cocked, upon the top of the wooden case behind which I crouched. Holmes covered the lantern, and we were left in absolute darkness. The smell of hot metal remained to assure us that the light was still there, ready to flash out at a moment's notice. My nerves were tense and strung like wires, and the gloom and deathly silence added to the strain. Even Jones's breathing seemed to grow softer as we waited in the blackness for the coming of the criminals.",
                "refinement_prompt": "IMPROVEMENT GUIDANCE:\n1. MAJOR STRUCTURAL ISSUES:\n- The completion omits a significant portion of the original's dialogue and planning in the cellar, especially the detailed instructions Holmes gives about positioning, the use of the lantern, and the explicit warning about potential danger and the need to shoot if necessary.\n- The completion invents a scene where Holmes leads the group to the furthest corner of the cellar and makes statements about the criminals coming through two feet of earth, which is not present in the original at this point.\n- The ending of the completion introduces invented summary statements about waiting for the adventure's climax, which are not part of the original passage.\n\n2. MISSING ELEMENTS:\n- The completion omits the specific mention of the crate containing a certain number of coins and the details about the bullion reserve being larger than usual, as explained by Mr. Merryweather.\n- The original's detailed instructions from Holmes about covering the lantern, sitting in the dark, and the plan for ambushing the criminals are missing.\n- The completion does not include Holmes's suggestion about playing cards and the reason for not doing so.\n- The original's description of the darkness, the smell of hot metal, and Watson's emotional response to the situation are only partially represented.\n- The explicit confirmation from Jones about having police officers stationed at the front door is not fully included.\n\n3. INACCURATE ELEMENTS:\n- The completion inaccurately summarizes the arrangement of the gold and the directors' suspicions, rather than presenting the step-by-step explanation found in the original.\n- There is an inaccurate sequence regarding Holmes's instructions and the group's preparations; the completion condenses and reorders these events, losing the original's careful buildup.\n- The completion attributes some invented lines and actions to Holmes, such as leading the group to a corner and making statements about the criminals' approach, which do not occur in the original at this stage.\n- The completion's summary of the waiting period and the closing remarks about \"all the avenues are closed\" and \"they have no chance at all\" are not present in the original and misrepresent the tone and content of the passage's conclusion."

            "prefix-probing": "He would sit for hours, with his violin across his knee, composing or improvising melodies that would alternately soothe or excite the listener. His love for music was as keen as his passion for deduction, and often the two would intermingle in the most curious fashion. I have seen him, after a long day spent in unraveling some intricate problem, take up his violin and lose himself in a rhapsody of sound, his mind clearly working through the complexities of the case even as his fingers danced across the strings. It was in these moments that I realized how deeply intertwined were the faculties of observation and imagination in my friend, Sherlock Holmes.\n\nOur rooms at 221B Baker Street were often filled with the strains of his music, sometimes soft and contemplative, at other times wild and passionate. I, for my part, found these interludes both a comfort and a source of inspiration, for they seemed to clear the air of the tension that so often accompanied our investigations. Holmes himself would sometimes pause in the midst of a piece, his eyes distant, as if some new insight had come to him through the medium of sound.\n\nIt was during one such evening, as the last notes of a haunting melody faded into the London fog outside our window, that a knock came at the door. Mrs. Hudson, our long-suffering landlady, entered with a card upon a tray. Holmes glanced at it, his expression sharpening with interest.\n\n\"A visitor, Watson,\" he said, handing me the card. \"Pray, read the name.\"\n\nI took the card and read aloud: \"Miss Mary Sutherland.\"\n\n\"Ah! I have no recollection of the name. Place her in the sitting-room, Mrs. Hudson, and ask her to wait a few moments.\"\n\nHolmes turned to me with a smile. \"You will, I am sure, Watson, find this case to be of some interest. Miss Sutherland is, I believe, a young lady of considerable means, and her problem, if I am not mistaken, will present us with a puzzle worthy of our attention.\"\n\nI had by this time come to recognize the signs of excitement in my friend, and I settled myself in my chair, eager to observe his methods once more. Holmes, meanwhile, busied himself with his violin, carefully placing it in its case before turning his full attention to the matter at hand.\n\n\"Shall we see the young lady now?\" I asked.\n\n\"By all means, Watson. Let us not keep her waiting.\"\n\nA few moments later, Miss Sutherland was shown into the room. She was a large, well-dressed woman of thirty or so, with a florid complexion and a nervous manner. Her eyes darted about the room, taking in every detail, before finally settling on Holmes.\n\n\"Pray, be seated, Miss Sutherland,\" he said kindly. \"I see that you have come to consult me. May I ask how you heard of my services?\"\n\n\"I was recommended by Mrs. Etherege, sir. She said that you were so clever in finding out things.\"\n\n\"I am happy to be of service. Please, tell me your story.\"\n\nMiss Sutherland took a deep breath and began to relate her tale. As she spoke, Holmes listened intently, his keen eyes never leaving her face. I, too, followed her narrative with interest, noting the details that might prove significant.\n\nShe explained that she lived with her mother and her stepfather, Mr. Windibank, a man much younger than her mother. Her father had died some years before, leaving her a comfortable income. Recently, she had become engaged to a man named Hosmer Angel, a quiet and reserved gentleman who had appeared in her life quite suddenly. Their courtship had been brief, and their meetings always took place in the presence of her mother or in public places. On the day of their wedding, Hosmer Angel had disappeared without a trace, leaving Miss Sutherland distraught and bewildered.\n\nHolmes asked a series of pointed questions, eliciting further details about Mr. Angel's appearance, habits, and the circumstances of his disappearance. Miss Sutherland answered as best she could, though it was clear that she was still deeply affected by the loss.\n\nWhen she had finished, Holmes sat back in his chair, steepling his fingers and closing his eyes in thought. For several minutes, the only sound in the room was the ticking of the clock on the mantelpiece.\n\nAt last, Holmes spoke. \"Your case is not, I think, as complicated as it appears, Miss Sutherland. I believe I can offer you an explanation that will set your mind at rest.\"\n\nHe proceeded to outline his reasoning, drawing upon the facts she had provided and his own remarkable powers of deduction. As he spoke, I marveled once again at the clarity and precision of his thought, and at the way in which he was able to see through the confusion of events to the underlying truth.\n\nMiss Sutherland listened in astonishment as Holmes revealed the solution to her problem. When he had finished, she thanked him profusely and took her leave, her spirits much improved.\n\nAs the door closed behind her, I turned to Holmes. \"That was a most curious case,\" I remarked. \"Your solution was as ingenious as ever.\"\n\nHolmes smiled. \"It was, perhaps, not so difficult as it seemed. The facts were all there, if one only knew where to look.\"\n\nHe reached for his violin once more, and as the first notes filled the room, I reflected on the extraordinary talents of my friend, and on the many adventures that still awaited us in the days to come."

          "text_segment": "What a time it seemed! From comparing notes afterwards it was but an hour and a quarter, yet it appeared to me that the night must have almost gone, and the dawn be breaking above us. My limbs were weary and stiff, for I feared to change my position; yet my nerves were worked up to the highest pitch of tension, and my hearing was so acute that I could not only hear the gentle breathing of my companions, but I could distinguish the deeper, heavier in-breath of the bulky Jones from the thin, sighing note of the bank director. From my position I could look over the case in the direction of the floor. Suddenly my eyes caught the glint of a light.\nAt first it was but a lurid spark upon the stone pavement. Then it lengthened out until it became a yellow line, and then, without any warning or sound, a gash seemed to open and a hand appeared, a white, almost womanly hand, which felt about in the centre of the little area of light. For a minute or more the hand, with its writhing fingers, protruded out of the floor. Then it was withdrawn as suddenly as it appeared, and all was dark again save the single lurid spark which marked a chink between the stones.\nIts disappearance, however, was but momentary. With a rending, tearing sound, one of the broad, white stones turned over upon its side and left a square, gaping hole, through which streamed the light of a lantern. Over the edge there peeped a clean-cut, boyish face, which looked keenly about it, and then, with a hand on either side of the aperture, drew itself shoulder-high and waist-high, until one knee rested upon the edge. In another instant he stood at the side of the hole and was hauling after him a companion, lithe and small like himself, with a pale face and a shock of very red hair.\n“It’s all clear,” he whispered. “Have you the chisel and the bags? Great Scott! Jump, Archie, jump, and I’ll swing for it!”\nSherlock Holmes had sprung out and seized the intruder by the collar. The other dived down the hole, and I heard the sound of rending cloth as Jones clutched at his skirts. The light flashed upon the barrel of a revolver, but Holmes’ hunting crop came down on the man’s wrist, and the pistol clinked upon the stone floor.\n“It’s no use, John Clay,” said Holmes blandly. “You have no chance at all.”\n“So I see,” the other answered with the utmost coolness. “I fancy that my pal is all right, though I see you have got his coat-tails.”\n“There are three men waiting for him at the door,” said Holmes.\n“Oh, indeed! You seem to have done the thing very completely. I must compliment you.”\n“And I you,” Holmes answered. “Your red-headed idea was very new and effective.”\n“You’ll see your pal again presently,” said Jones. “He’s quicker at climbing down holes than I am. Just hold out while I fix the derbies.”\n“I beg that you will not touch me with your filthy hands,” remarked our prisoner as the handcuffs clattered upon his wrists. “You may not be aware that I have royal blood in my veins. Have the goodness, also, when you address me always to say ‘sir’ and ‘please.’”\n“All right,” said Jones with a stare and a snigger. “Well, would you please, sir, march upstairs, where we can get a cab to carry your Highness to the police-station?”\n“That is better,” said John Clay serenely. He made a sweeping bow to the three of us and walked quietly off in the custody of the detective.\n“Really, Mr. Holmes,” said Mr. Merryweather as we followed them from the cellar, “I do not know how the bank can thank you or repay you. There is no doubt that you have detected and defeated in the most complete manner one of the most determined attempts at bank robbery that have ever come within my experience.”\n“I have had one or two little scores of my own to settle with Mr. John Clay,” said Holmes. “I have been at some small expense over this matter, which I shall expect the bank to refund, but beyond that I am amply repaid by having had an experience which is in many ways unique, and by hearing the very remarkable narrative of the Red-headed League.”\n“You see, Watson,” he explained in the early hours of the morning as we sat over a glass of whisky and soda in Baker Street, “it was perfectly obvious from the first that the only possible object of this rather fantastic business of the advertisement of the League, and the copying of the Encyclopædia, must be to get this not over-bright pawnbroker out of the way for a number of hours every day. It was a curious way of managing it, but, really, it would be difficult to suggest a better. The method was no doubt suggested to Clay’s ingenious mind by the colour of his accomplice’s hair. The £ 4 a week was a lure which must draw him, and what was it to them, who were playing for thousands? They put in the advertisement, one rogue has the temporary office, the other rogue incites the man to apply for it, and together they manage to secure his absence every morning in the week. From the time that I heard of the assistant having come for half wages, it was obvious to me that he had some strong motive for securing the situation.”\n“But how could you guess what the motive was?”\n“Had there been women in the house, I should have suspected a mere vulgar intrigue. That, however, was out of the question. The man’s business was a small one, and there was nothing in his house which could account for such elaborate preparations, and such an expenditure as they were at. It must, then, be something out of the house. What could it be? I thought of the assistant’s fondness for photography, and his trick of vanishing into the cellar. The cellar! There was the end of this tangled clue. Then I made inquiries as to this mysterious assistant and found that I had to deal with one of the coolest and most daring criminals in London. He was doing something in the cellar—something which took many hours a day for months on end. What could it be, once more? I could think of nothing save that he was running a tunnel to some other building.\n“So far I had got when we went to visit the scene of action. I surprised you by beating upon the pavement with my stick. I was ascertaining whether the cellar stretched out in front or behind. It was not in front. Then I rang the bell, and, as I hoped, the assistant answered it. We have had some skirmishes, but we had never set eyes upon each other before. I hardly looked at his face. His knees were what I wished to see. You must yourself have remarked how worn, wrinkled, and stained they were. They spoke of those hours of burrowing. The only remaining point was what they were burrowing for. I walked round the corner, saw the City and Suburban Bank abutted on our friend’s premises, and felt that I had solved my problem. When you drove home after the concert I called upon Scotland Yard and upon the chairman of the bank directors, with the result that you have seen.”\n“And how could you tell that they would make their attempt to-night?” I asked.\n“Well, when they closed their League offices that was a sign that they cared no longer about Mr. Jabez Wilson’s presence—in other words, that they had completed their tunnel. But it was essential that they should use it soon, as it might be discovered, or the bullion might be removed. Saturday would suit them better than any other day, as it would give them two days for their escape. For all these reasons I expected them to come to-night.”\n“You reasoned it out beautifully,” I exclaimed in unfeigned admiration. “It is so long a chain, and yet every link rings true.”\n“It saved me from ennui,” he answered, yawning. “Alas! I already feel it closing in upon me. My life is spent in one long effort to escape from the commonplaces of existence. These little problems help me to do so.”\n“And you are a benefactor of the race,” said I.\nHe shrugged his shoulders. “Well, perhaps, after all, it is of some little use,” he remarked. “‘L’homme c’est rien—l’œuvre c’est tout,’ as Gustave Flaubert wrote to George Sand.”",

He made a sweeping bow to the three of us and walked quietly off in the custody of the detective.\n\n\"Really, Mr. Holmes,\" said Mr. Merryweather, as we followed them from the cellar, \"I do not know how the bank can thank you or repay you. There is no doubt that you have detected and defeated in the most complete manner one of the most determined attempts at bank robbery that has ever come within my experience.\"\n\n\"I have had one or two little scores of my own to settle with Mr. John Clay,\" said Holmes. \"I have been at some small expense over this matter, which I shall expect the bank to refund, but beyond that I am amply repaid by having had an experience which is in many ways unique, and by hearing the very remarkable narrative of the Red-headed League.\"\n\n\"You see, Watson,\" he explained in the early hours of the morning as we sat over a glass of whisky and soda in Baker Street, \"it was perfectly obvious from the first that the only possible object of this rather fantastic business of the advertisement of the League, and the copying of the Encyclopaedia, must be to get this not over-bright pawnbroker out of the way for a number of hours every day.

                "text": "What a time it seemed! Deeper and deeper grew the feeling of suspense, and my nerves seemed to be stretched across my forehead. I could hear the gentle breathing of my companions, the occasional crisp sound of Jones’s handcuffs, and the dull, heavy ticking of the great clock above us. It must have been an hour and a quarter, but it seemed to me that the night must have gone by and the day have broken above us. My limbs were weary and stiff, for I feared to change my position; yet my senses were extraordinarily acute, and every little sound seemed to be magnified.\n\nSuddenly my eyes caught the glint of a light upon the floor. At first it was but a lurid spark upon the stone pavement. Then it lengthened out until it became a yellow line, and then, without any warning or sound, a hand appeared out of the centre of the line, and a white, almost womanly hand, which felt about in the centre of the little area of light. For a minute or more the hand, with its writhing fingers, protruded out of the floor. Then it was withdrawn as suddenly as it appeared, and all was dark again save the single lurid spark which marked a chink between the stones.\n\nIts disappearance, however, was but momentary. With a rending, tearing sound, one of the broad, white stones turned over upon its side, and left a square, gaping hole, through which streamed the light of a lantern. Over the edge there peeped a clean-cut, boyish face, which was afterwards described to me as that of John Clay, the murderer, thief, smasher, and forger. He was a remarkable man, this John Clay, with a face as keen as a razor and a brain as quick as a whip. He looked keenly about him, and then he rose slowly, and, climbing out of the hole, he drew after him a companion, a man with a shock of red hair. Both were dressed in dirty, greyish smocks, with dust upon their faces.\n\n\"It's all clear,\" whispered Clay. \"Have you the chisel and the bags? Quick, Archie, quick!\"\n\nHolmes sprang out and seized the intruder by the collar. The other dived down the hole, and I heard the sound of Jones's voice and the flash of his lantern as he followed him. \"The game's up, Clay,\" said Holmes, quietly. \"You have no chance at all.\"\n\n\"So I see,\" the other answered, with the utmost coolness. \"I fancy that my pal is all right, though I see you have got his coat-tails.\"\n\n\"There are three men waiting for him at the door,\" said Holmes.\n\n\"Oh, indeed! You seem to have done the thing very completely.

            "prefix-probing": "What a time it seemed! The hours passed with a strange mixture of anticipation and dread, as the shadows lengthened across the sitting-room at Baker Street. Holmes, ever the embodiment of composure, sat in his armchair, his long, thin fingers steepled beneath his chin, his keen eyes fixed upon the flickering fire. I, for my part, found it impossible to settle. I paced the room, glancing now and then at the clock upon the mantelpiece, and then at the window, half-expecting to see the figure of our visitor emerge from the fog-laden street below.\n\nIt was in such moments that the true nature of Holmes’s genius became apparent to me. While I fretted and speculated, he remained silent, his mind, I knew, working ceaselessly over the details of the case. The letter which had arrived that morning lay open upon the table, its contents still fresh in my mind:\n\n\"My dear Mr. Holmes,\n\nI am in the gravest distress and know not where to turn. I have heard of your remarkable powers and beg you to grant me an interview at your earliest convenience. Matters of the utmost delicacy and danger are at stake. I shall call upon you at half-past seven this evening.\n\nYours most sincerely,\n\nViolet Hunter.\"\n\nThe name was unfamiliar to me, but Holmes had merely raised an eyebrow upon reading it, and then, with a slight smile, had returned to his morning paper. Now, as the appointed hour drew near, I could not help but wonder what manner of trouble had brought Miss Hunter to our door.\n\nAt last, the bell rang. Holmes sprang to his feet, his whole manner alert and eager. \"That will be our client, Watson. Pray compose yourself.\"\n\nMrs. Hudson ushered in a young woman, plainly but neatly dressed, her face pale and anxious. She glanced nervously about the room before taking the seat Holmes indicated.\n\n\"Miss Violet Hunter, I presume?\" said Holmes, with his most reassuring air. \"Pray, tell us how we may be of service.\"\n\nShe hesitated for a moment, gathering her thoughts. \"Mr. Holmes, I have come to you because I am at my wits’ end. I am a governess by profession, and until recently I was employed by a family in Walsall. Unfortunately, they were obliged to reduce their household, and I found myself without a position.\"\n\nHolmes nodded encouragingly. \"Please continue.\"\n\n\"I advertised, and soon received a reply from a Mr. Rucastle of the Copper Beeches, near Winchester. He offered me a most generous salary—much more than I had ever received before—but there were certain conditions attached to the post which struck me as most peculiar.\"\n\n\"Peculiar in what way?\" Holmes interjected.\n\n\"He asked if I would be willing to cut my hair short. I was taken aback, but he assured me it was a mere whim of his wife’s, who disliked the sight of long hair. I hesitated, but the salary was so tempting that I agreed.\"\n\n\"And was that the only condition?\" Holmes asked.\n\n\"No, sir. There were others. I was to wear a particular dress each evening, and to sit in a certain chair by the window, with my back to the road. I was not to look out of the window, nor to leave the grounds without permission.\"\n\nHolmes’s eyes gleamed with interest. \"Most singular. And did you comply with these requests?\"\n\n\"I did, Mr. Holmes. But after a few days, I became convinced that something was amiss. I heard strange noises at night, and once, when I glanced in the mirror, I saw a face at the window—a face that vanished as soon as I turned.\"\n\nHolmes leaned forward. \"Did you mention this to Mr. Rucastle?\"\n\n\"I did, but he laughed it off, saying it was my imagination. But I am certain that there is some secret in that house, and I fear for my safety.\"\n\nHolmes rose and paced the room. \"Your instincts do you credit, Miss Hunter. Watson, what do you make of it?\"\n\nI considered for a moment. \"It seems to me that Miss Hunter is being used as a decoy. The insistence on her appearance and position by the window suggests that someone is meant to see her and mistake her for another.\"\n\n\"Precisely, Watson!\" Holmes exclaimed. \"Miss Hunter, you have done well to come to us. I believe you are in grave danger, and we must act at once.\"\n\nHe turned to me. \"Pack your bag, Watson. We leave for Winchester by the first train in the morning.\"\n\nThe following day found us speeding through the Hampshire countryside, Miss Hunter seated opposite us in the railway carriage. She seemed much relieved to have unburdened herself, and Holmes, in his quiet way, did his best to reassure her.\n\nUpon our arrival at Winchester, we made our way to the Copper Beeches, a large, rambling house set amidst gloomy trees. Mr. Rucastle, a stout, jovial man with a hearty laugh, greeted us effusively, but I could not shake the feeling that his geniality was but a mask.\n\nHolmes, as ever, was all politeness, but I could see that he was observing every detail—the arrangement of the furniture, the locks upon the doors, the heavy curtains drawn across certain windows.\n\nMiss Hunter showed us to her room, and there, in a low voice, she confided her suspicions. \"There is a wing of the house which is always kept locked. I have never seen inside it, but I am certain that it holds the key to the mystery.\"\n\nHolmes nodded. \"We must find a way to gain access. In the meantime, you must be on your guard.\"\n\nThat night, as the house slept, Holmes and I crept silently through the corridors, guided by the faint light of a lantern. We found the locked door, and with a deft movement, Holmes produced a set of tools from his pocket and set to work upon the lock.\n\nWithin moments, the door swung open, revealing a small, sparsely furnished room. In the corner sat a young woman, her face pale and drawn, her eyes wide with fear.\n\n\"My God!\" I exclaimed. \"Who are you?\"\n\nShe shrank back, but Holmes spoke gently. \"Do not be afraid. We are here to help you.\"\n\nAt that moment, a commotion arose behind us. Mr. Rucastle, his face contorted with rage, burst into the room, brandishing a heavy stick.\n\n\"You meddling fools!\" he shouted. \"Get out of here!\"\n\nHolmes stood his ground. \"We know your secret, Rucastle. This young lady is your daughter, whom you have kept prisoner in order to force her to give up her inheritance.\"\n\nRucastle lunged at Holmes, but I sprang forward and grappled with him. In the struggle, he slipped and fell, striking his head upon the floor. He lay still, and for a moment, I feared the worst. But Holmes, after a quick examination, pronounced him merely stunned.\n\nWe turned our attention to the young woman, who, with Miss Hunter’s help, soon recovered her composure. She told us her story in a trembling voice—how her father had sought to force her into a marriage she abhorred, and when she refused, had locked her away, hoping to break her will.\n\nWith the truth revealed, we summoned the authorities, and Mr. Rucastle was taken into custody. Miss Hunter, her courage and resourcefulness amply demonstrated, was offered a new position by a grateful relative of the young woman we had rescued.\n\nAs we made our way back to Baker Street, Holmes was uncharacteristically silent. At last, he turned to me with a smile. \"You see, Watson, how even the most seemingly trivial details may conceal a tale of the deepest significance.\"\n\nI nodded, reflecting upon the strange events we had witnessed. \"Indeed, Holmes. What a time it seemed!\""

There is, of course, the other woman, the drink, the push, the blow, the bruise, the sympathetic sister or landlady. The crudest of writers could invent nothing more crude.”\n“Indeed, your example is an unfortunate one for your argument,” said Holmes, taking the paper and glancing his eye down it. “This is the Dundas separation case, and, as it happens, I was engaged in clearing up some small points in connection with it. The husband was a teetotaler, there was no other woman, and the conduct complained of was that he had drifted into the habit of winding up every meal by taking out his false teeth and hurling them at his wife, which, you will allow, is not an action likely to occur to the imagination of the average story-teller.

If we could fly out of that window hand in hand, hover over this great city, gently remove the roofs, and peep in at the queer things which are going on, the strange coincidences, the plannings, the cross-purposes, the wonderful chains of events, working through generations, and leading to the most outré results, it would make all fiction with its conventionalities and foreseen conclusions most stale and unprofitable.”\n\n“And yet I am not convinced of it,” I answered. “The cases which come to light in the papers are, as a rule, bald enough and vulgar enough. We have in our police reports realism pushed to its extreme limits, and yet the result is, it must be confessed, neither fascinating nor artistic.”\n\n“A certain selection and discretion must be used in producing a realistic effect,” remarked Holmes. “This is wanting in the police report, where more stress is laid, perhaps, upon the platitudes of the magistrate than upon the details, which to an observer contain the vital essence of the whole matter. Depend upon it, there is nothing so unnatural as the commonplace.”\n\nI smiled and shook my head. “I can quite understand your thinking so,” I said. “Of course, in your position of unofficial adviser and helper to everybody who is absolutely puzzled, throughout three continents, you are brought in contact with all that is strange and bizarre. But here,” I picked up the morning paper from the table, “let us put it to a practical test. Here is the first heading upon which I come. ‘A husband’s cruelty to his wife.’ There is half a column of print, but I know without reading it that it is all perfectly familiar to me. There is, of course, the other woman, the drink, the push, the blow, the bruise, the sympathetic sister or landlady. The crudest of writers could invent nothing more crude.”\n\n“Indeed, your example is an unfortunate one for your argument,” said Holmes, taking the paper and glancing his eye down it. “This is the Dundas separation case, and, as it happens, I was engaged in clearing up some small points in connection with it. The husband was a teetotaller, there was no other woman, and the cruelty consisted in the fact that, as the woman lay in bed at night, he would get into the habit of winding up his artificial limb and hurling it at her to interrupt her sleep. It is a singular instance of the ingenuity of man’s cruelty. The case has, as you see, a certain element of grotesqueness about it.”\n\n“My dear Holmes!” I exclaimed.\n\n“I am sure that you will agree with me that the facts are stranger than any fiction.”\n\n“Indeed, if you state it, I must accept it,” said I.\n\n“And now, Watson, let us have a little snuff, for we are going to call upon our client.”",

These do not appear in the original passage and alter the structure and flow of the conversation.\n- The completion also adds a fabricated detail about an artificial limb being thrown at night to interrupt sleep, which is not present in the original. This is a significant invention that changes the nature of the described incident.\n\n2. MISSING ELEMENTS:\n- The completion omits the original's specific description of the husband's unusual behavior at meals, which is a key detail in the passage.\n- The original's invitation to \"take a pinch of snuff\" and the playful acknowledgment of Holmes scoring a point are not fully preserved in the completion, with the snuff reference only partially retained and the competitive tone diminished.\n\n3.

The morning was cold and gray, the air heavy with the promise of rain, and the street below bustled with the usual traffic of hansom cabs and hurried pedestrians. Holmes’s keen eyes seemed to pierce the fog, searching for something unseen by ordinary men.\n\nFor several minutes, he remained thus, silent and absorbed, before finally turning away from the window. His sharp, hawk-like features were set in an expression of intense concentration. He moved to the fireplace, where he picked up his long clay pipe and began to fill it with tobacco, his slender fingers working with practiced precision.\n\n\"You see, but you do not observe,\" he remarked suddenly, breaking the silence. \"That is the distinction, Watson.\"\n\nI looked at him in some surprise. \"What do you mean, Holmes?\"\n\nHe smiled faintly, lighting his pipe and sending a thin wisp of smoke curling toward the ceiling. \"Take the steps which lead up to this room, for example. How often have you seen them?\"\n\n\"Hundreds of times,\" I replied.\n\n\"And how many are there?\"\n\nI confessed my ignorance.\n\n\"You see, but you do not observe. To observe is to remember. I know that there are seventeen steps, because I have both seen and observed.\"\n\nHe paced the room, his mind clearly occupied with some problem. The morning’s post lay unopened on the table, but Holmes seemed uninterested in the ordinary affairs of the day. Instead, he was preoccupied with the subtle clues that only he could perceive, clues that would soon draw us both into another of his remarkable adventures.\n\nAt that moment, a sharp rap sounded at the door, and Mrs. Hudson entered, bearing a letter on a silver tray. Holmes took it with a nod, his eyes already alight with anticipation."

My father used to say that I had a head for figures and puzzles. When I was a child, I would amuse myself by memorizing long lists or passages from books. It is a habit that has served me well.”\n\nHolmes nodded approvingly. “It is a most useful talent, Miss Hunter. And so, you are able to write the dictated letters without glancing at the copy?”\n\n“Quite so. After the first few times, I found that I could recall the words and their order. It made the work much easier.”\n\n“Excellent. Now, tell me, did you ever notice anything unusual about the contents of the letters you were asked to copy?”\n\nShe hesitated for a moment. “They were all rather strange, Mr. Holmes. The sentences did not seem to make much sense, and the words were often repeated. I thought perhaps they were in some sort of code.”\n\nHolmes’s eyes sparkled. “A code, you say? That is most interesting. Did you ever try to decipher it?”\n\n“I did, but I could make nothing of it. The words seemed random, and there was no pattern that I could see.”\n\n“Very good, Miss Hunter. You have done well to observe so much. Now, one more question: did you ever see anyone else in the house while you were at your work?”\n\nShe shook her head. “No, Mr. Holmes. I was always alone in the room, except for Mr. Rucastle when he came to give me instructions.”\n\nHolmes leaned back in his chair, his fingers steepled. “Thank you, Miss Hunter. Your information has been most valuable. I believe we are a step closer to solving this little mystery.”"

I wasn’t best pleased, Mr. Holmes, when she married again so soon after father’s death, and a man who was nearly fifteen years younger than herself. Father was a plumber in the Tottenham Court Road, and he left a tidy business behind him, which mother carried on with Mr. Hardy, the foreman; but when Mr. Windibank came he made her sell the business, for he was very superior, being a traveller in wines. They got £ 4700 for the goodwill and interest, which wasn’t near as much as father could have got if he had been alive.”\nI had expected to see Sherlock Holmes impatient under this rambling and inconsequential narrative, but, on the contrary, he had listened with the greatest concentration of attention.\n“Your own little income,” he asked, “does it come out of the business?”\n“Oh, no, sir. It is quite separate and was left me by my uncle Ned in Auckland. It is in New Zealand stock, paying 4½ per cent. Two thousand five hundred pounds was the amount, but I can only touch the interest.”\n“You interest me extremely,” said Holmes. “And since you draw so large a sum as a hundred a year, with what you earn into the bargain, you no doubt travel a little and indulge yourself in every way. I believe that a single lady can get on very nicely upon an income of about £ 60.”\n“I could do with much less than that, Mr. Holmes, but you understand that as long as I live at home I don’t wish to be a burden to them, and so they have the use of the money just while I am staying with them. Of course, that is only just for the time. Mr. Windibank draws my interest every quarter and pays it over to mother, and I find that I can do pretty well with what I earn at typewriting. It brings me twopence a sheet, and I can often do from fifteen to twenty sheets in a day.”\n“You have made your position very clear to me,” said Holmes. “This is my friend, Dr. Watson, before whom you can speak as freely as before myself.

Pray, continue.”\n\nHelen Stoner clasped her hands nervously. “My mother was a widow when she married Dr. Roylott, who was my stepfather. My sister Julia and I were quite young at the time. We moved to his ancestral home in Surrey, Stoke Moran, which is a rather gloomy old house. My stepfather is a man of violent temper, and after some trouble with the law in India, he became even more irascible.”\n\nHolmes nodded. “I am aware of Dr. Roylott’s reputation. Please, tell me about your sister.”\n\n“My sister Julia was two years older than I. She was of a sensitive disposition, and the atmosphere at Stoke Moran did not suit her. About two years ago, she became engaged to be married. But just before the wedding, a terrible event occurred.”\n\nHolmes leaned forward. “Go on.”\n\n“One night, Julia came to my room, pale and trembling.

Did you ever discover what she meant?”\n\n“No, sir. We searched her room, but found nothing. The coroner’s verdict was death by natural causes, but I have always suspected foul play.”\n\n“And now you fear for your own safety?”\n\n“Yes, Mr. Holmes. I am to be married soon, and last night, I heard the same low whistle that Julia described. I am terrified that the same fate awaits me.”\n\nHolmes rose and paced the room. “Your case presents some singular features. I shall do all in my power to help you. Dr. Watson and I will visit Stoke Moran today. Please return home and await us.”\n\nHelen Stoner thanked Holmes and departed.

          "text_segment": "A flush stole over Miss Sutherland’s face, and she picked nervously at the fringe of her jacket. “I met him first at the gasfitters’ ball,” she said. “They used to send father tickets when he was alive, and then afterwards they remembered us, and sent them to mother. Mr. Windibank did not wish us to go. He never did wish us to go anywhere. He would get quite mad if I wanted so much as to join a Sunday-school treat. But this time I was set on going, and I would go; for what right had he to prevent? He said the folk were not fit for us to know, when all father’s friends were to be there. And he said that I had nothing fit to wear, when I had my purple plush that I had never so much as taken out of the drawer. At last, when nothing else would do, he went off to France upon the business of the firm, but we went, mother and I, with Mr. Hardy, who used to be our foreman, and it was there I met Mr. Hosmer Angel.”\n“I suppose,” said Holmes, “that when Mr. Windibank came back from France he was very annoyed at your having gone to the ball.”\n“Oh, well, he was very good about it. He laughed, I remember, and shrugged his shoulders, and said there was no use denying anything to a woman, for she would have her way.”\n“I see. Then at the gasfitters’ ball you met, as I understand, a gentleman called Mr. Hosmer Angel.”\n“Yes, sir. I met him that night, and he called next day to ask if we had got home all safe, and after that we met him—that is to say, Mr. Holmes, I met him twice for walks, but after that father came back again, and Mr. Hosmer Angel could not come to the house any more.”\n“No?”\n“Well, you know father didn’t like anything of the sort. He wouldn’t have any visitors if he could help it, and he used to say that a woman should be happy in her own family circle. But then, as I used to say to mother, a woman wants her own circle to begin with, and I had not got mine yet.”\n“But how about Mr. Hosmer Angel? Did he make no attempt to see you?”\n“Well, father was going off to France again in a week, and Hosmer wrote and said that it would be safer and better not to see each other until he had gone. We could write in the meantime, and he used to write every day. I took the letters in in the morning, so there was no need for father to know.”\n“Were you engaged to the gentleman at this time?”\n“Oh, yes, Mr. Holmes. We were engaged after the first walk that we took. Hosmer—Mr. Angel—was a cashier in an office in Leadenhall Street—and—”\n“What office?”\n“That’s the worst of it, Mr. Holmes, I don’t know.”\n“Where did he live, then?”\n“He slept on the premises.”\n“And you don’t know his address?”\n“No—except that it was Leadenhall Street.”\n“Where did you address your letters, then?”\n“To the Leadenhall Street Post Office, to be left till called for. He said that if they were sent to the office he would be chaffed by all the other clerks about having letters from a lady, so I offered to typewrite them, like he did his, but he wouldn’t have that, for he said that when I wrote them they seemed to come from me, but when they were typewritten he always felt that the machine had come between us. That will just show you how fond he was of me, Mr. Holmes, and the little things that he would think of.”\n“It was most suggestive,” said Holmes. “It has long been an axiom of mine that the little things are infinitely the most important. Can you remember any other little things about Mr. Hosmer Angel?”\n“He was a very shy man, Mr. Holmes. He would rather walk with me in the evening than in the daylight, for he said that he hated to be conspicuous. Very retiring and gentlemanly he was. Even his voice was gentle. He’d had the quinsy and swollen glands when he was young, he told me, and it had left him with a weak throat, and a hesitating, whispering fashion of speech. He was always well dressed, very neat and plain, but his eyes were weak, just as mine are, and he wore tinted glasses against the glare.”",

We were engaged after the first walk that we took. Mr. Angel was going away to France for a fortnight, and he said that he would write every day. He did write every day, and I answered every letter. Then he came back again, and we met him once or twice, but Mr. Windibank was very strict, and he would not let me go out. So Mr. Angel said that it would be better for us not to meet until he had gone.”\n\n“Mr. Angel was going away again?”\n\n“Yes, sir, he was going to France again. He said that he would write every day, and he did. He wrote every day, and I answered every letter.

                "refinement_prompt": "IMPROVEMENT GUIDANCE:\n1. MAJOR STRUCTURAL ISSUES:\n- The completion introduces invented background details about Miss Sutherland’s family, such as her father’s occupation, her inheritance, and her feelings of loneliness, which are not present in the original passage.\n- The completion omits a significant portion of the dialogue between Holmes and Miss Sutherland that occurs after the initial recounting of the ball, particularly the discussion about Mr. Windibank’s reaction upon returning from France, the sequence of meetings with Mr. Hosmer Angel, and the engagement timeline.\n\n2. MISSING ELEMENTS:\n- Early in the passage, the completion does not include the specific sequence of how tickets to the ball were received after her father’s death, nor does it mention the transition of ticket-sending from father to mother.\n- The middle section is missing the detailed exchange about Mr. Windibank’s reaction to their attendance at the ball, including his response and Holmes’s follow-up questions.\n- The progression of events regarding Miss Sutherland’s meetings with Mr. Hosmer Angel, including the number of meetings and the circumstances under which they stopped, is not fully represented.\n- The discussion about the engagement, including the timing and the details of their correspondence, is condensed and lacks the step-by-step development found in the original.\n- The completion omits the explanation about why Mr. Hosmer Angel preferred not to meet while her stepfather was present and the arrangement for writing letters.\n\n3. INACCURATE ELEMENTS:\n- The completion inaccurately attributes certain attitudes and actions to Miss Sutherland’s stepfather, such as his general kindness and the frequency of his absences, which are not specified in the original.\n- There is an inaccurate sequence regarding the order of events: the completion blends background information with the recounting of the ball, rather than following the original’s clear chronological structure.\n- The completion omits Holmes’s interjections and clarifying questions that help structure the conversation and clarify the timeline.\n- The engagement is mentioned abruptly without the context of the walks and the return of the stepfather, which disrupts the original sequence of events.\n- Some dialogue is condensed or paraphrased in a way that loses the nuance and progression of the original exchange, particularly regarding the correspondence and the reasons for not typewriting letters."

            "prefix-probing": "“I shall not be happy until I have it back,” she said. “If it were lost, I should be broken-hearted. I could not bear to think of it.”\n\nHolmes smiled gently. “You may set your mind at rest, Miss Sutherland. I have every hope that we shall recover your property. But first, let us be sure that we have all the facts. You say that the letter was in the envelope when you left the house?”\n\n“Yes, Mr. Holmes. I am quite certain of it. I remember distinctly sealing it myself, and I put it in my bag before I left for the post.”\n\n“And you did not open your bag again until you reached the post office?”\n\n“No, sir. I went straight there, and when I opened it, the envelope was gone.”\n\nHolmes steepled his fingers and regarded her thoughtfully. “And you are sure that no one could have taken it from your bag on the way?”\n\n“I am quite sure. I met no one, and I did not stop anywhere.”\n\n“Very good. Now, Miss Sutherland, you mentioned that your stepfather, Mr. Windibank, was opposed to your correspondence with Mr. Hosmer Angel?”\n\nShe nodded, her cheeks still flushed. “He did not approve, Mr. Holmes. He said it was not proper for a young lady to be writing to a gentleman.”\n\n“And yet you persisted?”\n\n“I could not help it. Mr. Angel was so kind, and I felt I could trust him.”\n\nHolmes glanced at Watson, who was busily taking notes. “And this Mr. Angel—did you ever meet him outside of your correspondence?”\n\n“Oh yes, sir. We met several times. He was always very respectful, and he never came to the house when my stepfather was at home.”\n\n“Curious,” murmured Holmes. “And what of your stepfather? Was he aware of these meetings?”\n\n“I do not think so. I was always careful.”\n\nHolmes leaned back in his chair. “Miss Sutherland, I must ask you a delicate question. Do you trust your stepfather?”\n\nShe hesitated, her fingers twisting the fringe of her jacket. “I—I do not know, Mr. Holmes. He has always been kind to me, but sometimes I feel as though he is keeping something from me.”\n\nHolmes nodded. “Thank you for your candour. Now, let us return to the matter of the letter. You say it contained a sum of money?”\n\n“Yes, sir. Ten pounds. It was to be a gift for Mr. Angel, as he was in some difficulty.”\n\n“Did anyone else know of this?”\n\n“No, sir. Only Mr. Angel and myself.”\n\nHolmes tapped his fingers together. “Very well, Miss Sutherland. I believe I have all the information I require for the moment. If you will leave your address with Dr. Watson, I shall communicate with you as soon as I have news.”\n\nShe rose, gathering her things. “Thank you, Mr. Holmes. I do hope you can help me.”\n\n“I shall do my utmost, Miss Sutherland. Good day.”\n\nWhen she had gone, Holmes turned to me with a gleam in his eye. “Well, Watson, what do you make of it?”\n\n“It is a curious case,” I replied. “The missing letter, the secret meetings, the stepfather’s opposition—it all seems rather tangled.”\n\nHolmes smiled. “Not so tangled as it appears. Consider, Watson: a young lady, an overbearing stepfather, a mysterious suitor who vanishes at the crucial moment. What does it suggest to you?”\n\nI shook my head. “I confess, Holmes, I am at a loss.”\n\nHe rose and paced the room. “It suggests, my dear Watson, that we are dealing with a case of deception. The question is, who is deceiving whom?”\n\nI watched as he paused by the window, his keen eyes scanning the street below. “You suspect the stepfather?”\n\n“I suspect everyone, until I have proof to the contrary. But consider: Mr. Windibank’s opposition to the match, his frequent absences, the secrecy surrounding Mr. Angel. It is all highly suggestive.”\n\n“And the missing letter?”\n\n“Ah, the letter. That is the key, Watson. If we can discover what became of it, we may unravel the whole affair.”\n\nHe turned abruptly. “Come, Watson. Let us pay a visit to Mr. Windibank. I have a few questions I should like to put to him.”\n\nI donned my hat and followed Holmes into the street, my mind whirling with speculation. As we made our way to the address Miss Sutherland had provided, I could not help but marvel at Holmes’s methodical approach. He seemed to see connections where I saw only confusion.\n\nWhen we arrived, Mr. Windibank received us with a mixture of surprise and suspicion. Holmes wasted no time in stating our business.\n\n“Mr. Windibank, we are investigating the disappearance of a letter belonging to your stepdaughter. May I ask if you have any knowledge of the matter?”\n\nHe shook his head, his expression guarded. “I know nothing of it, Mr. Holmes. My stepdaughter is prone to fancies. I am sure the letter will turn up.”\n\nHolmes regarded him steadily. “You are certain you have not seen it?”\n\n“Quite certain.”\n\nHolmes nodded. “Very well. Thank you for your time.”\n\nAs we left, Holmes turned to me. “There is more to this than meets the eye, Watson. I believe we are on the verge of a discovery.”\n\nI could only nod, eager to see where Holmes’s deductions would lead us next."

He was in dreadful earnest and made me swear, with my hands on the Testament, that whatever happened I would always be true to him. Mother said he was quite right to make me swear, and that it was a sign of his passion. Mother was all in his favour from the first and was even fonder of him than I was. Then, when they talked of marrying within the week, I began to ask about father; but they both said never to mind about father, but just to tell him afterwards, and mother said she would make it all right with him. I didn’t quite like that, Mr. Holmes. It seemed funny that I should ask his leave, as he was only a few years older than me; but I didn’t want to do anything on the sly, so I wrote to father at Bordeaux, where the company has its French offices, but the letter came back to me on the very morning of the wedding.”\n“It missed him, then?”\n“Yes, sir; for he had started to England just before it arrived.”\n“Ha! that was unfortunate. Your wedding was arranged, then, for the Friday. Was it to be in church?”\n“Yes, sir, but very quietly. It was to be at St. Saviour’s, near King’s Cross, and we were to have breakfast afterwards at the St. Pancras Hotel. Hosmer came for us in a hansom, but as there were two of us he put us both into it and stepped himself into a four-wheeler, which happened to be the only other cab in the street. We got to the church first, and when the four-wheeler drove up we waited for him to step out, but he never did, and when the cabman got down from the box and looked there was no one there! The cabman said that he could not imagine what had become of him, for he had seen him get in with his own eyes. That was last Friday, Mr. Holmes, and I have never seen or heard anything since then to throw any light upon what became of him.”\n“It seems to me that you have been very shamefully treated,” said Holmes.\n“Oh, no, sir! He was too good and kind to leave me so. Why, all the morning he was saying to me that, whatever happened, I was to be true; and that even if something quite unforeseen occurred to separate us, I was always to remember that I was pledged to him, and that he would claim his pledge sooner or later. It seemed strange talk for a wedding-morning, but what has happened since gives a meaning to it.”\n“Most certainly it does. Your own opinion is, then, that some unforeseen catastrophe has occurred to him?”\n“Yes, sir. I believe that he foresaw some danger, or else he would not have talked so. And then I think that what he foresaw happened.”\n“But you have no notion as to what it could have been?”\n“None.”\n“One more question. How did your mother take the matter?”\n“She was angry, and said that I was never to speak of the matter again.”\n“And your father? Did you tell him?”\n“Yes; and he seemed to think, with me, that something had happened, and that I should hear of Hosmer again. As he said, what interest could anyone have in bringing me to the doors of the church, and then leaving me? Now, if he had borrowed my money, or if he had married me and got my money settled on him, there might be some reason, but Hosmer was very independent about money and never would look at a shilling of mine. And yet, what could have happened? And why could he not write? Oh, it drives me half-mad to think of it, and I can’t sleep a wink at night.” She pulled a little handkerchief out of her muff and began to sob heavily into it.",

I had to obey him, but within a week of his return, the gentleman who used to call for me—Mr. Hosmer Angel—came to the house and asked if I would walk out with him. My mother was very fond of him, and she said that she was quite willing for us to go. We walked together several times, always in the evening, and he was always very kind and attentive. He was a very shy man, Mr. Holmes, and he would rather walk with me in the evening than in the daylight, for he said that he hated to be seen in a crowd. He was very respectful and always wore tinted glasses and had a soft, weak voice. He told me that he had had a bad attack of tonsillitis and that it had left him with a weak throat and a hesitating, whispering fashion of speech. He was always well dressed, but his clothes were rather old-fashioned. He was a very respectable man, Mr. Holmes, and he was very attentive to me. I was never quite sure whether he was a bachelor or a widower, for he spoke of his life as though it had been a very lonely one. He was a cashier in an office in Leadenhall Street, and he always came to see me in a cab, and he would never let me know where he lived. He said that he had only two friends in the world, and that he did not wish them to know of his visits to me.\n\n\"One day, just before my stepfather's return, Mr. Hosmer Angel asked me if I would marry him. My mother was very much in favour of it, but my stepfather was very angry, and he said that he would not have it. He said that he did not wish me to marry anyone, and that he would not give his consent. Mr. Angel said that he would wait until I was of age, and then we could be married without my stepfather's consent. I was very much attached to Mr. Angel, and I agreed to wait. We continued to see each other, but always in the same quiet way, and always in the evening. My stepfather was very much opposed to the match, and he did all he could to prevent us from meeting. He even went so far as to forbid me to write to Mr. Angel, and he said that if I did, he would turn me out of the house. I was very unhappy, Mr. Holmes, for I loved Mr. Angel very dearly, and I could not bear to be parted from him.\n\n\"At last, the time came when I was to be of age, and Mr. Angel said that he would marry me as soon as I was twenty-one. My stepfather was away in France at the time, and my mother was very much in favour of the marriage. We arranged to be married at St. Saviour's Church, near King's Cross, at eight o'clock in the morning. Mr. Angel came for us in a cab, and we drove to the church together. My mother went with us, and we were all very happy. When we got to the church, Mr. Angel said that he had forgotten something, and he asked me to wait for him while he went back to the cab. He never came back, Mr. Holmes. I waited and waited, but he never returned. At last, the cabman came in and asked if there was anything the matter, and I told him what had happened. We waited for more than an hour, but there was no sign of Mr. Angel. I have never seen or heard from him since that day.”\n\nSherlock Holmes had been listening with the deepest attention to this strange story. He now sat up in his chair, and I could see that he was deeply interested. “Your statement is most interesting,” he said. “Has it occurred to you that your stepfather’s opposition to your marriage might have some connection with Mr. Angel’s disappearance?”"

Then he took down from the rack the old and oily clay pipe, which was to him as a counsellor, and, having lit it, he leaned back in his chair, with the thick blue cloud-wreaths spinning up from him, and a look of infinite languor in his face.\n“Quite an interesting study, that maiden,” he observed. “I found her more interesting than her little problem, which, by the way, is rather a trite one. You will find parallel cases, if you consult my index, in Andover in ’77, and there was something of the sort at The Hague last year. Old as is the idea, however, there were one or two details which were new to me. But the maiden herself was most instructive.”\n“You appeared to read a good deal upon her which was quite invisible to me,” I remarked.\n“Not invisible but unnoticed, Watson. You did not know where to look, and so you missed all that was important. I can never bring you to realise the importance of sleeves, the suggestiveness of thumb-nails, or the great issues that may hang from a boot-lace. Now, what did you gather from that woman’s appearance? Describe it.”\n“Well, she had a slate-coloured, broad-brimmed straw hat, with a feather of a brickish red. Her jacket was black, with black beads sewn upon it, and a fringe of little black jet ornaments. Her dress was brown, rather darker than coffee colour, with a little purple plush at the neck and sleeves. Her gloves were greyish and were worn through at the right forefinger. Her boots I didn’t observe. She had small round, hanging gold earrings, and a general air of being fairly well-to-do in a vulgar, comfortable, easy-going way.”\nSherlock Holmes clapped his hands softly together and chuckled.\n“’Pon my word, Watson, you are coming along wonderfully. You have really done very well indeed. It is true that you have missed everything of importance, but you have hit upon the method, and you have a quick eye for colour. Never trust to general impressions, my boy, but concentrate yourself upon details. My first glance is always at a woman’s sleeve. In a man it is perhaps better first to take the knee of the trouser. As you observe, this woman had plush upon her sleeves, which is a most useful material for showing traces. The double line a little above the wrist, where the typewritist presses against the table, was beautifully defined. The sewing-machine, of the hand type, leaves a similar mark, but only on the left arm, and on the side of it farthest from the thumb, instead of being right across the broadest part, as this was. I then glanced at her face, and, observing the dint of a pince-nez at either side of her nose, I ventured a remark upon short sight and typewriting, which seemed to surprise her.”\n“It surprised me.”\n“But, surely, it was obvious. I was then much surprised and interested on glancing down to observe that, though the boots which she was wearing were not unlike each other, they were really odd ones; the one having a slightly decorated toe-cap, and the other a plain one. One was buttoned only in the two lower buttons out of five, and the other at the first, third, and fifth. Now, when you see that a young lady, otherwise neatly dressed, has come away from home with odd boots, half-buttoned, it is no great deduction to say that she came away in a hurry.”\n“And what else?” I asked, keenly interested, as I always was, by my friend’s incisive reasoning.\n“I noted, in passing, that she had written a note before leaving home but after being fully dressed. You observed that her right glove was torn at the forefinger, but you did not apparently see that both glove and finger were stained with violet ink. She had written in a hurry and dipped her pen too deep. It must have been this morning, or the mark would not remain clear upon the finger. All this is amusing, though rather elementary, but I must go back to business, Watson. Would you mind reading me the advertised description of Mr. Hosmer Angel?”",

Then he took down from the rack the old and oily clay pipe, which was to him as a counsellor, and, having lit it, he leaned back in his chair, with the thick blue cloud-wreaths spinning up from him, and a look of infinite languor in his face.\n\n\"Quite an interesting study, that maiden,\" he observed. \"I found her more interesting than her little problem, which, by the way, is rather a trite one. You will find parallel cases, if you consult my index, in Andover in '77, and at The Hague in '84. A mere matter of detail, but the woman herself was most instructive.\"\n\n\"You appeared to read a good deal upon her which was quite invisible to me,\" I remarked.\n\n\"Not invisible but unnoticed, Watson. You did not know where to look, and so you missed all that was important. I dare say, but you saw more than you thought.\"\n\n\"I saw nothing remarkable save that she was very plainly dressed, and that she wore a remarkably broad-brimmed hat with a feather of a brickish red. Her jacket was black, with black beads sewn upon it, and a fringe of little black jet ornaments. Her dress was brown, rather darker than coffee colour, with a little purple plush at the collar and cuffs. Her boots I noticed were a little above the usual size, and she wore them square-toed. Gloves were grayish and worn at the right forefinger. Her earrings were of dangle type, and she carried a black handbag.\"\n\n\"Excellent!\" said Holmes. \"Your description is not far out. You have, at least, the great virtue of accuracy. It is not your fault that you have not observed more. Rather, it is your habit to give only a general impression, while you leave the details to be filled in by your imagination. Now, in this case, I did not see as much as you did, but I saw more. I saw that her plush was a little worn, and that the double line a little above the wrist showed that she had recently written at a typewriter. The mark is never seen except in typewriting, and it is always seen in that occupation. The left forefinger was stained with violet ink. The boots, as you say, were square-toed, but also odd, the one having a slightly different cap from its fellow. They were also but half laced up, as if she had been in a hurry to dress.\"\n\n\"And her glasses?\" I asked.\n\n\"You observed no doubt the impression left by the pince-nez upon the side of her nose. I could not but remark upon the short sight and typewriting, which together suggested the identity of the person.\"\n\n\"I was surprised to see that you knew so much.\"\n\n\"It was a trifle, but there is nothing so important as trifles. You have missed everything of importance by not having enough attention to details.

A few moments later, a boy in buttons entered the room.\n\n\"Go down to the cab-stand, Wiggins,\" said Holmes, \"and bring a couple of the sharpest lads with you.\"\n\n\"Yes, sir,\" said the boy, and disappeared with a cheerful grin.\n\nHolmes picked up his hat and cane. \"I am going out, Watson,\" said he. \"I have some business to attend to which cannot be delayed. I shall be back in an hour or two. If you should have occasion to write, address the letter to Baker Street.\"\n\nI nodded, and Holmes left the room with his usual briskness. I sat for some time musing over the strange events of the morning, and wondering what new development would arise from Holmes's investigations. The case had certainly assumed a most remarkable aspect, and I felt that my friend's keen intellect would soon unravel the tangled skein.\n\nPresently, I heard the sound of wheels and footsteps in the street below, and, looking out of the window, I saw Holmes hurrying along the pavement, followed by a group of ragged urchins. He was evidently on the track of some clue, and I could not help admiring the energy and resourcefulness with which he pursued his inquiries.\n\nAn hour passed, and then another, but there was no sign of Holmes. I began to grow uneasy, and was just about to set out in search of him when the door opened and he entered, looking as calm and composed as ever.\n\n\"Well, Watson,\" said he, \"I think we have made some progress. I have discovered the whereabouts of our man, and I hope to have him in custody before nightfall.\"\n\n\"You astonish me,\" I exclaimed. \"How did you manage it?\"\n\nHolmes smiled. \"It is a simple matter of observation and deduction. I followed up the clue which we obtained this morning, and it led me straight to the right quarter. Our friend is not so clever as he thinks himself, and he has left traces which a blind man could follow.\"\n\nI could not but marvel at the confidence with which Holmes spoke, and I felt that the mystery was as good as solved. We sat down to a hasty meal, and then Holmes rose and prepared to go out again.\n\n\"I shall not be long, Watson,\" said he. \"If I am not back by midnight, you may expect me early in the morning. In the meantime, I would advise you to remain indoors, as there may be danger abroad.\"\n\nI promised to follow his instructions, and Holmes departed with a nod and a smile. Left to myself, I tried to occupy my mind with a book, but my thoughts kept wandering to the strange case in which we were engaged. The hours dragged slowly by, and I was just beginning to doze in my chair when I was roused by a sharp knock at the door.\n\nIt was Holmes, looking a little pale but triumphant.\n\n\"It is done, Watson,\" said he. \"The man is in custody, and the case is at an end.\"\n\nI sprang to my feet. \"You have succeeded, then?\"\n\n\"Yes, thanks to the assistance of our young friends. The man made a desperate attempt to escape, but we were too quick for him.\"\n\n\"And the motive?\" I asked eagerly.\n\nHolmes smiled. \"Ah, that is a story in itself. But come, Watson, let us sit down and I will tell you all that has occurred.\"\n\nWe drew our chairs up to the fire, and Holmes began his narrative, his keen eyes shining with the excitement of the chase. As I listened to his clear and logical account of the events, I could not help feeling once more the fascination of his extraordinary powers, and the strange charm which surrounded the life of Sherlock Holmes."

Holmes stuck his feet up on the corner of the mantelpiece and, leaning back with his hands in his pockets, began talking, rather to himself, as it seemed, than to us.\n“The man married a woman very much older than himself for her money,” said he, “and he enjoyed the use of the money of the daughter as long as she lived with them. It was a considerable sum, for people in their position, and the loss of it would have made a serious difference. It was worth an effort to preserve it. The daughter was of a good, amiable disposition, but affectionate and warm-hearted in her ways, so that it was evident that with her fair personal advantages, and her little income, she would not be allowed to remain single long. Now her marriage would mean, of course, the loss of a hundred a year, so what does her stepfather do to prevent it? He takes the obvious course of keeping her at home and forbidding her to seek the company of people of her own age. But soon he found that that would not answer forever. She became restive, insisted upon her rights, and finally announced her positive intention of going to a certain ball. What does her clever stepfather do then? He conceives an idea more creditable to his head than to his heart. With the connivance and assistance of his wife he disguised himself, covered those keen eyes with tinted glasses, masked the face with a moustache and a pair of bushy whiskers, sunk that clear voice into an insinuating whisper, and doubly secure on account of the girl’s short sight, he appears as Mr. Hosmer Angel, and keeps off other lovers by making love himself.”\n“It was only a joke at first,” groaned our visitor. “We never thought that she would have been so carried away.”\n“Very likely not. However that may be, the young lady was very decidedly carried away, and, having quite made up her mind that her stepfather was in France, the suspicion of treachery never for an instant entered her mind. She was flattered by the gentleman’s attentions, and the effect was increased by the loudly expressed admiration of her mother. Then Mr. Angel began to call, for it was obvious that the matter should be pushed as far as it would go if a real effect were to be produced. There were meetings, and an engagement, which would finally secure the girl’s affections from turning towards anyone else. But the deception could not be kept up forever. These pretended journeys to France were rather cumbrous. The thing to do was clearly to bring the business to an end in such a dramatic manner that it would leave a permanent impression upon the young lady’s mind and prevent her from looking upon any other suitor for some time to come. Hence those vows of fidelity exacted upon a Testament, and hence also the allusions to a possibility of something happening on the very morning of the wedding. James Windibank wished Miss Sutherland to be so bound to Hosmer Angel, and so uncertain as to his fate, that for ten years to come, at any rate, she would not listen to another man. As far as the church door he brought her, and then, as he could go no farther, he conveniently vanished away by the old trick of stepping in at one door of a four-wheeler and out at the other. I think that was the chain of events, Mr. Windibank!”",

But I am fairly certain that you are not aware of all the facts. Let me reconstruct this case for you, for my own edification, if not for yours. Mr. Windibank, married to a woman older than himself, found that as long as her daughter remained single and at home, he enjoyed the use of her income—some hundred a year, I believe. It was a considerable sum for people in their position, and the loss of it would have been a serious matter. The daughter, amiable and affectionate, with every advantage of person and position, was not likely to remain single long. A marriage would mean the loss of the income, so what does her stepfather do? He takes the obvious course—he keeps her at home and prevents her from meeting people. But soon she becomes restive, insists upon her rights, and is determined to go to a ball. What does her clever stepfather do then? With the connivance of his wife, he disguises himself, using tinted glasses, a false moustache, and a voice altered by a laryngeal affection. He is a man of resource, and he takes advantage of the girl's short sight and trusting nature. He appears as Mr. Hosmer Angel, woos her, and, to make sure that no other suitor has a chance, he keeps the courtship secret. The girl is flattered by the attention of a man whom her mother approves, and the stepfather, as Mr. Angel, is always at her elbow. The engagement is made, and the stepfather finds himself in a dilemma. He cannot keep up the deception for ever, so he arranges for a dramatic disappearance, which will leave a lasting impression upon the girl's mind, and prevent her from looking at any other man for years to come. He takes her to the church door, and then, by the old trick of entering one door of a four-wheeler and out at the other, he disappears utterly from her life.\"\n\nHolmes leaned back in his chair with a look of satisfaction. \"It is as well,\" he said, \"that we should do business with men of this sort.

            "prefix-probing": "“It may be so, Mr. Holmes,” said he, “but you can do nothing. I beg you to excuse me.”\n\nWith a bow, he turned on his heel and strode from the room.\n\n“So much for your client, Dr. Watson,” said Holmes when the door had closed behind him. “He is a man of strong character, and he is not likely to be turned from his purpose. But, pray, sit down, and let us talk it over.”\n\nI obeyed, and Holmes drew up his chair to mine.\n\n“The case,” said he, “is one where the facts are, to some extent, obvious, but the motives are somewhat obscure. That is always the case with crimes of this class. The question is, what does this man hope to gain by his conduct? What is at the root of it?”\n\nI shook my head. “I cannot imagine.”\n\n“Nor can I, at present. But we have not yet all the facts. It is possible that by a careful examination of the circumstances we may arrive at some conclusion. Let us review the case, as far as we know it.”\n\nHe leaned back in his chair, and his eyes half closed as he began to talk, more to himself than to me.\n\n“Mr. Hosmer Angel, as he calls himself, appears to have been a man of singular habits. He came into Miss Sutherland’s life in a mysterious way, and he has left it in an equally mysterious manner. We have no proof that he is dead, or that he is alive. The only thing we know for certain is that he has disappeared. The question is, why?”\n\nI ventured to suggest that perhaps he had tired of the young lady’s company.\n\n“No, no, Watson,” said Holmes. “That would be too simple. Besides, the man’s conduct does not bear out such a supposition. He was evidently deeply interested in her, and he took every precaution to keep their relations secret. Why should he do that if he meant to desert her? No, there is something deeper in this case.”\n\nHe paused, and then continued:\n\n“Let us consider the facts. Miss Sutherland is a young lady of means. She has a considerable sum of money coming to her at her majority. Her stepfather, Mr. Windibank, is a man of business, but he is not, I think, a man of large means. He is, however, a man of strong will and determined character. He has, as we have seen, a great dislike to Miss Sutherland’s marrying. Why? Because, as long as she remains single, he has the use of her money. That is the motive which I read in this case. It is as clear as daylight.”\n\n“But how could he prevent her from marrying?”\n\n“By inventing a fictitious lover, and by keeping her heart engaged, he could prevent her from accepting any other suitor. When the time came for her to inherit her money, he could still keep her under his influence. It is a bold and ingenious scheme, Watson, and it has succeeded—up to a point.”\n\n“But the man himself—Hosmer Angel?”\n\n“Ah! That is the point. Hosmer Angel is none other than Mr. Windibank himself. It is a very common trick, and it is astonishing that so clever a man as Mr. Windibank should have risked it. But he counted on the girl’s innocence and on the secrecy of the correspondence. He wore tinted glasses and a false moustache, and he wrote typewritten letters so that his handwriting should not be recognized. It was all very well contrived.”\n\nI could not help laughing at the simplicity of the device.\n\n“It is one of the most singular cases that I have ever encountered,” said Holmes, closing his notebook. “And now, Watson, let us go and have some lunch.”"

Among these he rummaged and read, with intervals of note-taking and of meditation, until we were past Reading. Then he suddenly rolled them all into a gigantic ball and tossed them up onto the rack.\n“Have you heard anything of the case?” he asked.\n“Not a word. I have not seen a paper for some days.”\n“The London press has not had very full accounts. I have just been looking through all the recent papers in order to master the particulars. It seems, from what I gather, to be one of those simple cases which are so extremely difficult.”\n“That sounds a little paradoxical.”\n“But it is profoundly true. Singularity is almost invariably a clue. The more featureless and commonplace a crime is, the more difficult it is to bring it home. In this case, however, they have established a very serious case against the son of the murdered man.”\n“It is a murder, then?”\n“Well, it is conjectured to be so. I shall take nothing for granted until I have the opportunity of looking personally into it. I will explain the state of things to you, as far as I have been able to understand it, in a very few words.\n“Boscombe Valley is a country district not very far from Ross, in Herefordshire. The largest landed proprietor in that part is a Mr. John Turner, who made his money in Australia and returned some years ago to the old country. One of the farms which he held, that of Hatherley, was let to Mr. Charles McCarthy, who was also an ex-Australian. The men had known each other in the colonies, so that it was not unnatural that when they came to settle down they should do so as near each other as possible. Turner was apparently the richer man, so McCarthy became his tenant but still remained, it seems, upon terms of perfect equality, as they were frequently together. McCarthy had one son, a lad of eighteen, and Turner had an only daughter of the same age, but neither of them had wives living. They appear to have avoided the society of the neighbouring English families and to have led retired lives, though both the McCarthys were fond of sport and were frequently seen at the race-meetings of the neighbourhood. McCarthy kept two servants—a man and a girl. Turner had a considerable household, some half-dozen at the least. That is as much as I have been able to gather about the families. Now for the facts.\n“On June 3rd, that is, on Monday last, McCarthy left his house at Hatherley about three in the afternoon and walked down to the Boscombe Pool, which is a small lake formed by the spreading out of the stream which runs down the Boscombe Valley. He had been out with his serving-man in the morning at Ross, and he had told the man that he must hurry, as he had an appointment of importance to keep at three. From that appointment he never came back alive.\n“From Hatherley Farmhouse to the Boscombe Pool is a quarter of a mile, and two people saw him as he passed over this ground. One was an old woman, whose name is not mentioned, and the other was William Crowder, a game-keeper in the employ of Mr. Turner. Both these witnesses depose that Mr. McCarthy was walking alone. The game-keeper adds that within a few minutes of his seeing Mr. McCarthy pass he had seen his son, Mr. James McCarthy, going the same way with a gun under his arm. To the best of his belief, the father was actually in sight at the time, and the son was following him. He thought no more of the matter until he heard in the evening of the tragedy that had occurred.\n“The two McCarthys were seen after the time when William Crowder, the game-keeper, lost sight of them. The Boscombe Pool is thickly wooded round, with just a fringe of grass and of reeds round the edge. A girl of fourteen, Patience Moran, who is the daughter of the lodge-keeper of the Boscombe Valley estate, was in one of the woods picking flowers. She states that while she was there she saw, at the border of the wood and close by the lake, Mr. McCarthy and his son, and that they appeared to be having a violent quarrel. She heard Mr. McCarthy the elder using very strong language to his son, and she saw the latter raise up his hand as if to strike his father. She was so frightened by their violence that she ran away and told her mother when she reached home that she had left the two McCarthys quarrelling near Boscombe Pool, and that she was afraid that they were going to fight. She had hardly said the words when young Mr. McCarthy came running up to the lodge to say that he had found his father dead in the wood, and to ask for the help of the lodge-keeper. He was much excited, without either his gun or his hat, and his right hand and sleeve were observed to be stained with fresh blood. On following him they found the dead body stretched out upon the grass beside the pool. The head had been beaten in by repeated blows of some heavy and blunt weapon. The injuries were such as might very well have been inflicted by the butt-end of his son’s gun, which was found lying on the grass within a few paces of the body. Under these circumstances the young man was instantly arrested, and a verdict of ‘wilful murder’ having been returned at the inquest on Tuesday, he was on Wednesday brought before the magistrates at Ross, who have referred the case to the next Assizes. Those are the main facts of the case as they came out before the coroner and the police-court.”",

Well, then, I shall just have to go over the ground again.\n\n“Boscombe Valley is a country district not very far from Ross, in Herefordshire. The largest landed proprietor in that part is a Mr. John Turner, who made his money in Australia and returned some years ago to the old country. One of the farms which he held, that of Hatherley, was let to Mr. Charles McCarthy, who was also an ex-Australian. The men had known each other in the colonies, so that it was not unnatural that they should be friends. McCarthy was a widower, and he had an only son of eighteen, with a daughter of the same age, old Turner. They lived in retired fashion, and were supposed to have few friends, but they were fond of sport, and their chief society was found among the people who came down to the races.\n\n“McCarthy left his house at Hatherley about three in the afternoon of Monday, the 3rd of June, and walked down to the Boscombe Pool, which is a small lake formed by the spreading out of the stream which runs down the Boscombe Valley. He had been out with his serving-man in the morning at Ross, and he had told the man that he must hurry, as he had an appointment of importance to keep at three. From that appointment he never came back alive.\n\n“From Hatherley Farmhouse to the Boscombe Pool is a quarter of a mile, and two people saw him as he passed over this ground. One was an old woman, whose name is not mentioned, and the other was William Crowder, a game-keeper in the employ of Mr. Turner. Both these witnesses depose that Mr. McCarthy was walking alone. The game-keeper adds that within a few minutes of his seeing Mr. McCarthy pass, he had seen his son, Mr. James McCarthy, going the same way with a gun under his arm. To the best of his belief, the father was actually in sight at the time, and the son was following him. He thought no more of the matter until he heard in the evening of the tragedy that had occurred.\n\n“The two McCarthys were seen after the time when William Crowder, the game-keeper, lost sight of them. The Boscombe Pool is thickly wooded round, with just a fringe of grass and of reeds round the edge. A girl of fourteen, Patience Moran, daughter of the lodge-keeper, was in the woods at this point. She states that while she was there she saw, at the border of the wood and close by the lake, Mr. McCarthy and his son, and that they appeared to be having a violent quarrel. She heard Mr. McCarthy the elder using very strong language to his son, and she saw the latter raise up his hand as if to strike his father. She was so frightened by their violence that she ran away and told her mother when she reached home that she had left the two McCarthys quarrelling near Boscombe Pool, and that she was afraid that they were going to fight. She had hardly said the words when young Mr. McCarthy came running up to the lodge to say that he had found his father dead in the wood, and to ask for the help of the lodge-keeper. He was much excited, without either his gun or his hat, and his right hand and sleeve were observed to be stained with fresh blood. On following him, they found the dead body stretched out upon the grass beside the pool. The head had been beaten in by repeated blows of some heavy and blunt weapon. The injuries were such as might very well have been inflicted by the butt-end of his son’s gun, which was found lying on the grass within a few paces of the body. Under these circumstances the young man was instantly arrested, and a verdict of ‘wilful murder’ having been returned at the inquest on Tuesday, he was on Wednesday brought before the magistrates at Ross, who have referred the case to the next Assizes.”",

One of the farms which he held, that of Hatherley, was let to Mr. Charles McCarthy, who was also an ex-Australian. The men had known each other in the colonies, so that it was not unnatural that they should be friends. Turner was a widower, but he had an only daughter of the same age as McCarthy’s only son. Neither of them had any other relatives in England. They lived in a retired fashion, avoiding the society of the neighbouring English families, and keeping to themselves. McCarthy kept two servants—a man and a girl. Turner had a considerable household, some half-dozen at the least. Their chief interest in life appeared to be the turf. They were frequently seen at the races, and had a horse or two in training. To all appearance they led a quiet and retired life, but the fact that they were both ex-Australians and had known each other in the colonies was the bond between them.\n\n“Now for the facts. On Monday, the 3rd of June, McCarthy left his house at Hatherley about three in the afternoon, and walked down to the Boscombe Pool, which is a small lake formed by the spreading out of the stream which runs down the Boscombe Valley. He had been out with his serving-man in the morning at Ross, and he had told the man that he must hurry, as he had an appointment of importance to keep at three.

                "refinement_prompt": "IMPROVEMENT GUIDANCE:\n1. MAJOR STRUCTURAL ISSUES:\n- The completion omits a significant explanatory transition where Holmes clarifies that he will explain the state of things as far as he understands them, in a concise manner. This sets up the summary of the case and is important for the narrative flow.\n- The completion invents a brief exchange where Watson says, \"I should like to hear it,\" and Holmes responds, \"That is very easily done. You have heard no details yet? Well, then, I shall just have to go over the ground again.\" This exchange is not present in the original and alters the structure of the dialogue.\n\n2. MISSING ELEMENTS:\n- The completion omits the detail that neither McCarthy nor Turner had wives living, which is relevant to the family background.\n- It does not mention that Turner had an only daughter of the same age as McCarthy's son, which is a key parallel in the family structures.\n- The completion leaves out the information about the McCarthys and Turners avoiding the society of neighboring English families and leading retired lives, which provides context for their social situation.\n- The number and roles of servants in each household are not fully described; specifically, the completion does not mention that McCarthy kept two servants (a man and a girl) and that Turner had a larger household, estimated at half a dozen or more.\n- The completion omits the explicit statement that Holmes is about to move from background information to the facts of the case, which helps organize the narrative.\n\n3. INACCURATE ELEMENTS:\n- There is a misattribution in the family structure: the completion suggests that McCarthy had a son and Turner had a daughter, but the phrasing is unclear and could be interpreted as McCarthy having both a son and a daughter, which is inaccurate.\n- The completion inaccurately summarizes the relationship between Turner and McCarthy, suggesting only that they \"should be friends,\" rather than specifying the nature of their acquaintance and the terms of their relationship.\n- The sequence of events is slightly altered in the transition from the press coverage to the summary of the case, with the invented dialogue changing the flow.\n- The completion omits the precise timing of the inquest and the magistrate hearing, which are important chronological details in the original.\n- The completion does not specify that the verdict of 'wilful murder' was returned at the inquest on Tuesday, and that the magistrate hearing was on Wednesday, thus losing the clear timeline.\n\nOverall, the completion would be improved by restoring the missing family and household details, correcting the invented dialogue, clarifying the relationships, and ensuring the sequence and timing of events match the original structure."

Local aid is always either worthless or else biased. If you will keep the two corner seats I shall get the tickets.”\n\nWe had the carriage to ourselves save for an immense litter of papers which Holmes had brought with him. Among his talk, as the train rattled on, he would pause to glance at a note or to compare a document, and I could see that his mind was working with that eager and yet controlled intensity which I had only observed when he was hot upon a scent. I had not seen him so deeply absorbed since the famous study of the \"Scarlet Thread of Murder,\" and the case of the \"Trepoff Murder in Odessa.\" For a long time he remained silent, but at last, throwing down the paper, he leaned back in his seat and looked at me with the kind of languid good-humour which I knew so well.\n\n\"Watson,\" said he, \"you have a grand gift of silence. It makes you quite invaluable as a companion. 'Pon my word, it is a great thing for me to have someone to talk to, for my own thoughts are not over-pleasant. I was wondering what to do with myself to-day, when I received this telegram from Miss Mary Sutherland.\"\n\nHe took a folded paper from his pocket and handed it to me. It ran thus:\n\n'Please be at my house at a quarter to eight to-night. I have something of the utmost importance to communicate to you. MARY SUTHERLAND.'\n\n\"I have no doubt,\" said Holmes, as I returned the paper, \"that she will call upon me. She is a lady of considerable means, and her case is certainly a most remarkable one.\"\n\n\"You have already formed an opinion?\" I asked.\n\n\"As to the main facts, yes. But as to the details, I am still in the dark.\"\n\n\"But why will she not come to you at Baker Street?\"\n\n\"She is, I fancy, a little nervous and prefers to see me in her own home.\"\n\n\"And what is the case?\"\n\n\"You remember the story of the 'Noble Bachelor'?\"\n\n\"Perfectly.\"\n\n\"It is something of the same kind. A young lady has lost her fiancé under circumstances which point to foul play.\"\n\n\"You suspect murder?\"\n\n\"I suspect nothing. I have only the facts. But here we are at our station, and I see a cab waiting.\"\n\nA short drive brought us to a large, sombre house in a quiet street. The door was opened by a middle-aged woman, who ushered us into a well-furnished drawing-room. Miss Sutherland was a woman of large frame, with a heavy face and a slow, stolid manner. She rose as we entered.\n\n\"Mr. Holmes?\" she asked.\n\n\"Yes. This is my friend and colleague, Dr. Watson. Pray be seated. Now, Miss Sutherland, I am all attention.\"\n\nShe seemed to find it difficult to begin, and at last, with a sudden effort, she burst out:\n\n\"I have lost my fiancé, Mr. Holmes. He has disappeared without a word.\"\n\n\"When did you see him last?\"\n\n\"On the morning of our wedding.\"\n\n\"And since then?\"\n\n\"Not a word.\"\n\n\"And his name?\"\n\n\"Hosmer Angel.\"\n\nHolmes made a note of the name.\n\n\"Describe him.\"\n\nShe gave a fairly detailed account of the man, his appearance, his habits, and the circumstances of their engagement. Holmes listened with his eyes half closed, and when she had finished, he asked a few more questions, then sat for a few moments in silence.\n\n\"Your story is most interesting,\" he said at last. \"I shall do what I can to help you.\"\n\nShe thanked him and left, and Holmes turned to me with a smile.\n\n\"Well, Watson, what do you make of it?\"\n\n\"It is a curious case,\" I replied. \"The man seems to have vanished completely.\"\n\n\"Yes, and the curious thing is that nobody but Miss Sutherland seems to have seen much of him. Her stepfather, Mr. Windibank, was always away when Hosmer Angel called.\"\n\n\"You think there is something suspicious in that?\"\n\n\"I do. I have already sent a telegram to Mr. Windibank, asking him to call upon me.\"\n\n\"And you expect him?\"\n\n\"I do.\"\n\nAs we spoke, there was a knock at the door, and a man entered. He was a small, shifty-eyed man, with a nervous manner.\n\n\"Mr. Windibank?\" said Holmes.\n\n\"Yes.\"\n\n\"Pray be seated. I wish to ask you a few questions about your stepdaughter's fiancé, Mr. Hosmer Angel.\"\n\nWindibank shifted uneasily in his chair. \"I know nothing about him,\" he said. \"I was always away on business when he called.\"\n\n\"That is very singular,\" said Holmes. \"You never saw him at all?\"\n\n\"Never.\"\n\nHolmes looked at him keenly. \"You are sure of that?\"\n\n\"Quite sure.\"\n\n\"Thank you. That will do for the present.\"\n\nWindibank rose and left the room. Holmes turned to me with a smile.\n\n\"Well, Watson, what do you think now?\"\n\n\"I think the case is becoming more complicated.\"\n\n\"On the contrary, it is becoming more simple. I have almost solved it.\"\n\n\"You have?\"\n\n\"Yes. I have only to confirm a few details.\"\n\nHe took up his hat and coat. \"Come, Watson, we must pay a visit to a certain typewriting office.\"\n\nWe found the office in a side street, and Holmes made some inquiries. Presently he returned to me, his face alight with satisfaction.\n\n\"It is as I thought,\" he said. \"The typewriting of the letters matches exactly.\"\n\n\"You mean—\"\n\n\"I mean that Mr. Hosmer Angel and Mr. Windibank are one and the same person.\"\n\nI stared at him in astonishment.\n\n\"But why—\"\n\n\"It is simple. Mr. Windibank wished to prevent his stepdaughter from marrying, so he invented a suitor who would disappear at the critical moment.\"\n\n\"And Miss Sutherland?\"\n\n\"She will recover in time.\"\n\nWe returned to Baker Street, and Holmes wrote a brief note to Miss Sutherland, explaining the case. As he finished, he turned to me with a smile.\n\n\"You see, Watson, how easy it is to deceive the innocent.\"\n\nI nodded, marvelling once more at the subtlety of my friend's mind."

It must be confessed, however, that the case looks exceedingly grave against the young man, and it is very possible that he is indeed the culprit. There are several people in the neighbourhood, however, and among them Miss Turner, the daughter of the neighbouring landowner, who believe in his innocence, and who have retained Lestrade, whom you may recollect in connection with the Study in Scarlet, to work out the case in his interest. Lestrade, being rather puzzled, has referred the case to me, and hence it is that two middle-aged gentlemen are flying westward at fifty miles an hour instead of quietly digesting their breakfasts at home.”\n“I am afraid,” said I, “that the facts are so obvious that you will find little credit to be gained out of this case.”\n“There is nothing more deceptive than an obvious fact,” he answered, laughing. “Besides, we may chance to hit upon some other obvious facts which may have been by no means obvious to Mr. Lestrade. You know me too well to think that I am boasting when I say that I shall either confirm or destroy his theory by means which he is quite incapable of employing, or even of understanding. To take the first example to hand, I very clearly perceive that in your bedroom the window is upon the right-hand side, and yet I question whether Mr. Lestrade would have noted even so self-evident a thing as that.”\n“How on earth—”\n“My dear fellow, I know you well. I know the military neatness which characterises you. You shave every morning, and in this season you shave by the sunlight; but since your shaving is less and less complete as we get farther back on the left side, until it becomes positively slovenly as we get round the angle of the jaw, it is surely very clear that that side is less illuminated than the other. I could not imagine a man of your habits looking at himself in an equal light and being satisfied with such a result. I only quote this as a trivial example of observation and inference. Therein lies my métier, and it is just possible that it may be of some service in the investigation which lies before us.",

            "prefix-probing": "“I could hardly imagine a more damning case,” I remarked.\n\nSherlock Holmes leaned back in his chair and regarded me with that mixture of amusement and patience which I had come to know so well. “You are quick to form conclusions, Watson,” said he. “But you will remember that it is a capital mistake to theorize before one has data. Insensibly one begins to twist facts to suit theories, instead of theories to suit facts.”\n\n“But the evidence seems so conclusive,” I protested. “The footprints, the letter, the motive—everything points in one direction.”\n\nHolmes smiled. “It is precisely when everything appears to point in one direction that we must be most on our guard. The art of detection, my dear Watson, is not to be misled by the obvious. Let us review the facts once more.”\n\nHe took up the sheet of paper upon which he had jotted down the salient points of the case. “We have, first, the disappearance of Mr. Hosmer Angel. Second, the testimony of Miss Mary Sutherland. Third, the curious behaviour of her stepfather, Mr. Windibank. And finally, the letter, typewritten and unsigned, which summoned Miss Sutherland to the church.”\n\nI nodded. “And yet, Holmes, you must admit that the stepfather’s conduct is highly suspicious.”\n\n“Indeed it is, Watson. But let us not forget that suspicion is not proof. We must seek for the one fact which cannot be explained away. Now, consider: why should Mr. Hosmer Angel insist upon all correspondence being typewritten? Why should he wear tinted glasses and speak in a muffled voice?”\n\n“To conceal his identity, obviously.”\n\n“Precisely. But from whom? Not from Miss Sutherland, who was devoted to him, but from someone else. From Mr. Windibank, perhaps? Or is it possible that Mr. Windibank and Mr. Hosmer Angel are, in fact, the same person?”\n\nI started in my chair. “You mean—?”\n\nHolmes held up a hand. “Let us not jump to conclusions. But the possibility must be considered. The typewritten letters, the disguise, the secrecy—all point to a deliberate attempt to mislead. And who would benefit most from preventing Miss Sutherland’s marriage?”\n\n“Her stepfather, of course. He would lose her income if she married.”\n\n“Exactly. Now, let us see if the facts fit this theory. If Mr. Windibank is indeed Mr. Hosmer Angel, then all the peculiarities of the case are explained. The typewriting, the disguise, the sudden disappearance—all are part of a carefully constructed deception.”\n\nI sat in silence, marvelling at the subtlety of my friend’s reasoning. “Holmes,” I said at last, “you have once again unraveled the mystery where I saw only confusion.”\n\nHe smiled. “It is, perhaps, a singular case, but not, I think, an insoluble one. Shall we call upon Miss Sutherland and lay the matter before her?”\n\n“With pleasure,” I replied, and together we set out to bring the truth to light."

On the inspector of constabulary informing him that he was a prisoner, he remarked that he was not surprised to hear it, and that it was no more than his deserts. This observation of his had the natural effect of removing any traces of doubt which might have remained in the minds of the coroner’s jury.”\n“It was a confession,” I ejaculated.\n“No, for it was followed by a protestation of innocence.”\n“Coming on the top of such a damning series of events, it was at least a most suspicious remark.”\n“On the contrary,” said Holmes, “it is the brightest rift which I can at present see in the clouds. However innocent he might be, he could not be such an absolute imbecile as not to see that the circumstances were very black against him. Had he appeared surprised at his own arrest, or feigned indignation at it, I should have looked upon it as highly suspicious, because such surprise or anger would not be natural under the circumstances, and yet might appear to be the best policy to a scheming man. His frank acceptance of the situation marks him as either an innocent man, or else as a man of considerable self-restraint and firmness. As to his remark about his deserts, it was also not unnatural if you consider that he stood beside the dead body of his father, and that there is no doubt that he had that very day so far forgotten his filial duty as to bandy words with him, and even, according to the little girl whose evidence is so important, to raise his hand as if to strike him. The self-reproach and contrition which are displayed in his remark appear to me to be the signs of a healthy mind rather than of a guilty one.”\nI shook my head. “Many men have been hanged on far slighter evidence,” I remarked.\n“So they have. And many men have been wrongfully hanged.”\n“What is the young man’s own account of the matter?”\n“It is, I am afraid, not very encouraging to his supporters, though there are one or two points in it which are suggestive. You will find it here, and may read it for yourself.”\nHe picked out from his bundle a copy of the local Herefordshire paper, and having turned down the sheet he pointed out the paragraph in which the unfortunate young man had given his own statement of what had occurred. I settled myself down in the corner of the carriage and read it very carefully. It ran in this way:\n“Mr. James McCarthy, the only son of the deceased, was then called and gave evidence as follows: ‘I had been away from home for three days at Bristol, and had only just returned upon the morning of last Monday, the 3rd. My father was absent from home at the time of my arrival, and I was informed by the maid that he had driven over to Ross with John Cobb, the groom. Shortly after my return I heard the wheels of his trap in the yard, and, looking out of my window, I saw him get out and walk rapidly out of the yard, though I was not aware in which direction he was going. I then took my gun and strolled out in the direction of the Boscombe Pool, with the intention of visiting the rabbit warren which is upon the other side. On my way I saw William Crowder, the game-keeper, as he had stated in his evidence; but he is mistaken in thinking that I was following my father. I had no idea that he was in front of me. When about a hundred yards from the pool I heard a cry of “Cooee!” which was a usual signal between my father and myself. I then hurried forward, and found him standing by the pool. He appeared to be much surprised at seeing me and asked me rather roughly what I was doing there. A conversation ensued which led to high words and almost to blows, for my father was a man of a very violent temper. Seeing that his passion was becoming ungovernable, I left him and returned towards Hatherley Farm. I had not gone more than 150 yards, however, when I heard a hideous outcry behind me, which caused me to run back again. I found my father expiring upon the ground, with his head terribly injured. I dropped my gun and held him in my arms, but he almost instantly expired. I knelt beside him for some minutes, and then made my way to Mr. Turner’s lodge-keeper, his house being the nearest, to ask for assistance. I saw no one near my father when I returned, and I have no idea how he came by his injuries. He was not a popular man, being somewhat cold and forbidding in his manners, but he had, as far as I know, no active enemies. I know nothing further of the matter.’\n“The Coroner: Did your father make any statement to you before he died?\n“Witness: He mumbled a few words, but I could only catch some allusion to a rat.\n“The Coroner: What did you understand by that?\n“Witness: It conveyed no meaning to me. I thought that he was delirious.\n“The Coroner: What was the point upon which you and your father had this final quarrel?\n“Witness: I should prefer not to answer.\n“The Coroner: I am afraid that I must press it.\n“Witness: It is really impossible for me to tell you. I can assure you that it has nothing to do with the sad tragedy which followed.\n“The Coroner: That is for the court to decide. I need not point out to you that your refusal to answer will prejudice your case considerably in any future proceedings which may arise.\n“Witness: I must still refuse.\n“The Coroner: I understand that the cry of ‘Cooee’ was a common signal between you and your father?\n“Witness: It was.\n“The Coroner: How was it, then, that he uttered it before he saw you, and before he even knew that you had returned from Bristol?\n“Witness (with considerable confusion): I do not know.\n“A Juryman: Did you see nothing which aroused your suspicions when you returned on hearing the cry and found your father fatally injured?\n“Witness: Nothing definite.\n“The Coroner: What do you mean?\n“Witness: I was so disturbed and excited as I rushed out into the open, that I could think of nothing except of my father. Yet I have a vague impression that as I ran forward something lay upon the ground to the left of me. It seemed to me to be something grey in colour, a coat of some sort, or a plaid perhaps. When I rose from my father I looked round for it, but it was gone.\n“‘Do you mean that it disappeared before you went for help?’\n“‘Yes, it was gone.’\n“ ‘You cannot say what it was?’\n“‘No, I had a feeling something was there.’\n“‘How far from the body?’\n“‘A dozen yards or so.’\n“‘And how far from the edge of the wood?’\n“‘About the same.’\n“‘Then if it was removed it was while you were within a dozen yards of it?’\n“‘Yes, but with my back towards it.’\n“This concluded the examination of the witness.”\n“I see,” said I as I glanced down the column, “that the coroner in his concluding remarks was rather severe upon young McCarthy. He calls attention, and with reason, to the discrepancy about his father having signalled to him before seeing him, also to his refusal to give details of his conversation with his father, and his singular account of his father’s dying words. They are all, as he remarks, very much against the son.”\nHolmes laughed softly to himself and stretched himself out upon the cushioned seat. “Both you and the coroner have been at some pains,” said he, “to single out the very strongest points in the young man’s favour. Don’t you see that you alternately give him credit for having too much imagination and too little? Too little, if he could not invent a cause of quarrel which would give him the sympathy of the jury; too much, if he evolved from his own inner consciousness anything so outré as a dying reference to a rat, and the incident of the vanishing cloth. No, sir, I shall approach this case from the point of view that what this young man says is true, and we shall see whither that hypothesis will lead us. And now here is my pocket Petrarch, and not another word shall I say of this case until we are on the scene of action. We lunch at Swindon, and I see that we shall be there in twenty minutes.”",

My father was absent from home at the time of my arrival, and I was informed by the maid that he had driven over to the Boscombe Arms to meet a friend. I waited about half an hour, and then, seeing him drive past, I went out to meet him, as I wished to speak to him. On the way I was told by the crowder that he was going down to the pool, and as I had not seen him for some days, I naturally wished to see him again. I therefore followed him. On the way to the pool I saw William Crowder, who was in the fields, but he did not speak to me. I then walked on, and within a hundred yards of the pool I heard a cry of ‘Cooee!’ which was a usual signal between my father and myself. I then hurried forward, and found him standing by the pool.

I was so excited and horrified at the time that I cannot be certain of anything.”\n\nA severe cross-examination followed, but nothing additional was elicited.\n\n“Did you notice,” remarked Holmes, “that the evidence of the coroner was especially severe upon the points which seemed to tell against the accused? The signal, the refusal to state the cause of the quarrel, the allusion to a rat, and the impression of something grey in the wood—all these were considered as points against him.”\n\n“I did,” said I. “But I cannot help thinking that the coroner and the jury were right. Did you not think so?”\n\n“Not at all. I think that they are all points in his favour. I would ask you to note the curious contradiction to which your own remarks have drawn my attention. You say that he has no imagination, and yet he invents a reason for the quarrel which he refuses to state. You say, again, that he has too much imagination, and that he invents a rat and a vanishing cloth. I am sure that you will agree with me that the statement is a very bald and uncoloured account of the facts. It is not to be wondered at that the coroner should have come to the conclusion that the young man was guilty, especially as he refused to give the reason for the quarrel, and as the evidence of his guilt is so strong. But I am not convinced. I shall take the liberty of assuming that his statement is true, and see where that assumption leads us. And now, my dear Watson, let us for a time turn our attention to a less momentous matter. I have a paper here which I shall glance over while we are on our journey.”",

On the inspector of constabulary informing him that he was a prisoner, he remarked that he was not surprised to hear it, and that it was no more than his deserts. This observation of his had the natural effect of removing any traces of doubt which might have remained in the minds of the coroner’s jury.”\n\n“It was a confession,” I ejaculated.\n\n“No, for it was followed by a protestation of innocence.”\n\n“Coming on the top of such a damning series of events, it was at least a most suspicious remark.”\n\n“On the contrary,” said Holmes, “it is the brightest rift which I can at present see in the clouds. However innocent he might be, he could not be such an absolute imbecile as not to see that the circumstances were very black against him. Had he appeared surprised at his own arrest, or feigned indignation at it, I should have looked upon it as highly suspicious, because such surprise or anger would not be natural under the circumstances, and yet might appear to be the best policy to a scheming man. His frank acceptance of the situation marks him as either an innocent man, or else as a man of considerable self-restraint and firmness. As to his remark about his deserts, it was also not unnatural if you consider that he stood beside the dead body of his father, and that there is no doubt that he had that very day so far forgotten his filial duty as to bandy words with him, and even, according to the little girl whose evidence is so important, to raise his hand as if to strike him. The self-reproach and contrition which are displayed in his remark appear to me to be the signs of a healthy mind rather than of a guilty one.”\n\nI shook my head. “Many men have been hanged on far slighter evidence,” I remarked.\n\n“So they have. And many men have been wrongfully hanged.”\n\n“What is the young man’s own account of the matter?”\n\n“It is, I am afraid, not very encouraging to his supporters, though there are one or two points in it which are suggestive. You will find it here, and may read it for yourself.”\n\nHe picked out from his bundle a copy of the local Herefordshire paper, and having turned down the sheet he pointed out the paragraph in which the unfortunate young man had given his own statement of what had occurred. I settled myself down in the corner of the carriage and read it very carefully. It ran in this way:\n\n“Mr. James McCarthy, the only son of the deceased, was then called and gave evidence as follows:—‘I had been away from home for three days at Bristol, and had only just returned upon the morning of last Monday, the 3rd. My father was absent from home at the time of my arrival, and I was informed by the maid that he had driven over to Ross with John Cobb, the groom. Shortly after my return I heard the wheels of his trap in the yard, and, looking out of my window, I saw him get out and walk rapidly out of the yard, though I was not aware in which direction he was going. I then took my gun and strolled out in the direction of the Boscombe Pool, with the intention of visiting the rabbit warren which is upon the other side. On the way I saw William Crowder, the game-keeper, as he has stated in his evidence, but he is mistaken in thinking that I was following my father. I had no idea that he was in front of me. When about a hundred yards from the pool I heard a cry of “Cooee!” which was a usual signal between my father and myself. I then hurried forward, and found him standing by the pool. He appeared to be surprised to see me and asked me rather roughly what I was doing there. A conversation ensued which led to high words and almost to blows, for my father was a man of a very violent temper. Seeing that his passion was becoming ungovernable, I left him and returned towards Hatherley Farm. I had not gone more than 150 yards, however, when I heard a hideous outcry behind me, which caused me to run back again. I found my father expiring upon the ground, with his head terribly injured. I dropped my gun and held him in my arms, but he could not say anything except some few incoherent words. I carried him to the nearest lodge, and then returned with help, but he was quite dead.’\n\n“The Coroner: Did your father say anything to you before he died?\n\n“Witness: He mumbled a few words, but I could only catch some allusion to a rat.\n\n“The Coroner: What did you understand by that?\n\n“Witness: It conveyed no meaning to me.

            "prefix-probing": "In the first place, I should like to ask you whether you have observed anything which may account for the dog’s strange behaviour on the night of the tragedy?”\n\nThe question seemed to puzzle the inspector. “I can’t say that I have, Mr. Holmes. The dog was always a quiet animal, and I never heard of its showing any signs of violence before.”\n\n“Was it in the habit of barking at strangers?”\n\n“Never, sir. It was as gentle as a lamb with everyone.”\n\nHolmes leaned back in his chair, his eyes half closed, and his long, thin fingers pressed together. “It is curious,” he remarked, “very curious. You will remember, Watson, that the evidence at the inquest showed that the dog was found crouching beside the body, whining piteously, but that there was no sign of any struggle or of the animal having attempted to defend its master.”\n\n“That is so,” I replied. “It was mentioned by several witnesses.”\n\n“Now, if the dog had been in the habit of attacking strangers, or even of barking at them, we might have supposed that it had been silenced by the murderer. But if, as you say, it was always gentle, then its behaviour on that night becomes all the more remarkable. It is as if it had recognised the intruder, or at least had not regarded him as a stranger.”\n\nThe inspector nodded thoughtfully. “That is a point, Mr. Holmes. I had not considered it in that light.”\n\n“There is another point,” Holmes continued. “The evidence showed that the window of the study was open, and that there were marks on the sill as if someone had entered or left by that means. Yet the ground beneath the window was soft, and there were no footprints.”\n\n“That is true, sir. We examined it carefully.”\n\n“Then we must suppose that the person who entered or left by the window did so with great care, or else that the marks were made by someone inside the room.”\n\nThe inspector looked perplexed. “It is a puzzling case, Mr. Holmes, and no mistake.”\n\nHolmes smiled. “It is, indeed. But I have a theory which may account for some of these peculiarities. I should like to visit the scene of the crime, if you have no objection.”\n\n“None at all, sir. I shall be glad of your assistance.”\n\n“Then let us lose no time. Come, Watson, we have work to do.”\n\nWe set out at once for the house where the tragedy had occurred. It was a gloomy, old-fashioned building, standing in its own grounds, and surrounded by a high wall. The study, where the murder had taken place, was a small room at the back of the house, with a single window opening on to the garden.\n\nHolmes examined the window carefully. “You see, Watson,” he said, “the marks on the sill are quite distinct. But there are no corresponding marks on the ground outside. That suggests that the window was opened from within, and that the marks were made by someone inside the room.”\n\nHe turned to the inspector. “Was anything missing from the room?”\n\n“Nothing, sir. Everything was in its place.”\n\n“And the door was locked on the inside?”\n\n“Yes, sir. We had to break it open.”\n\nHolmes nodded. “That is significant. It suggests that the murderer was someone whom the victim knew and admitted willingly, or else that he had a key.”\n\nThe inspector looked impressed. “You have a wonderful way of putting things, Mr. Holmes.”\n\nHolmes smiled. “It is merely a matter of observation and deduction. Now, let us see if we can find any further clues.”\n\nHe examined the carpet, the furniture, and the fireplace with the utmost care, but found nothing to throw light on the mystery. At last he turned to the inspector. “I should like to see the dog,” he said.\n\nThe animal was brought in, a large, handsome retriever, with a gentle expression in its eyes. Holmes patted it kindly, and it wagged its tail in response.\n\n“You see, Watson,” he said, “there is nothing savage about this creature. It is as gentle as a child. Yet on the night of the murder it was found crouching beside the body, whining piteously. That suggests that it was frightened, not by the presence of a stranger, but by something else.”\n\nHe turned to the inspector. “Has the dog shown any signs of fear or excitement since the tragedy?”\n\n“None at all, sir. It has been perfectly quiet.”\n\nHolmes nodded. “That is as I expected. The dog was not alarmed by the murderer, but by something else—perhaps by the suddenness of the crime, or by the sight of its master lying dead.”\n\nHe turned to me. “What do you think, Watson?”\n\n“I think you are right, Holmes. The dog’s behaviour is easily explained if we suppose that it was frightened by the tragedy itself, and not by the presence of a stranger.”\n\n“Exactly. And that brings us back to the question of the window. If the murderer did not enter or leave by the window, then he must have come in by the door. And if the door was locked on the inside, then he must have had a key, or else have been admitted by the victim.”\n\nThe inspector looked thoughtful. “That narrows the field, Mr. Holmes. There are only a few people who had keys to the house.”\n\n“Precisely. And if we can find out who those people were, and what their movements were on the night of the crime, we may be able to solve the mystery.”\n\nWe spent the rest of the day making inquiries among the servants and the members of the household. It soon became clear that only three people had keys to the house: the victim himself, his brother, and the housekeeper. The brother had been away from home on the night of the murder, and the housekeeper had been in her own room, which was at the other end of the house.\n\nHolmes questioned them both closely, but could find nothing to arouse his suspicions. At last he turned to me with a sigh. “It is a most perplexing case, Watson. There are one or two minor points which are worth considering, but the main facts seem to defy explanation.”\n\n“Perhaps something will turn up,” I suggested.\n\nHolmes smiled. “Perhaps. In the meantime, we must keep our eyes and ears open, and be ready to act when the opportunity arises.”\n\nWe returned to Baker Street late that evening, tired and disappointed. But Holmes was not discouraged. “We have made some progress, Watson,” he said. “We have eliminated several possibilities, and we have narrowed the field of inquiry. That is always something.”\n\nHe sat down at his desk and began to make notes in his notebook. I watched him in silence, marvelling at his patience and his powers of deduction. At last he looked up.\n\n“There is one point which still puzzles me, Watson,” he said. “The behaviour of the dog. It is the key to the whole mystery, I am sure of it. If we can only understand what frightened the animal, we shall be on the right track.”\n\nI nodded. “It is certainly a curious point.”\n\nHolmes smiled. “Curious, but not inexplicable. I have a theory, Watson, and I mean to test it. But first, I must make a few inquiries. Will you come with me?”\n\n“Of course, Holmes. Where are we going?”\n\n“To the house of the victim’s brother. I have a suspicion that he may be able to throw some light on the matter.”\n\nWe set out at once, and soon arrived at the brother’s house. He received us politely, but seemed nervous and ill at ease. Holmes questioned him closely about his movements on the night of the murder, and about his relations with the victim. He answered all our questions readily, but I could not help feeling that he was concealing something.\n\nAt last Holmes rose to go. “Thank you for your courtesy,” he said. “I may have to trouble you again.”\n\nThe brother bowed, and we took our leave. As soon as we were outside, Holmes turned to me.\n\n“Well, Watson, what do you think?”\n\n“I think he is hiding something, Holmes.”\n\n“So do I. And I mean to find out what it is. Come, let us return to Baker Street. I have work to do.”\n\nFor the next two days Holmes was busy with his investigations. He visited the house several times, questioned the servants, and examined the scene of the crime with the utmost care. At last he announced that he was ready to act.\n\n“Watson,” he said, “I have solved the mystery. The key to the whole case lies in the behaviour of the dog. Come, and I will show you how it was done.”\n\nWe set out once more for the house. Holmes led the way to the study, and pointed to the window.\n\n“You see, Watson, the marks on the sill were made by the dog, not by the murderer. The animal jumped up in its excitement, and left the marks with its paws. That is why there were no footprints outside.”\n\nI stared at him in amazement. “But the door was locked on the inside. How did the murderer escape?”\n\nHolmes smiled. “He did not escape. He was never in the room at all. The murder was committed from outside the window. The victim was sitting at his desk, with his back to the window. The murderer crept up in the darkness, and shot him through the open window. Then he closed the window, and the dog, in its excitement, jumped up and left the marks on the sill.”\n\nI gasped. “But who was the murderer?”\n\nHolmes’s eyes gleamed. “The brother. He had a motive, and he had the opportunity. He was not at home on the night of the murder, as he claimed. He was here, in the garden, waiting for his chance. He knew that his brother always sat at his desk at that hour, and he took advantage of the open window to commit the crime.”\n\nThe inspector, who had been listening in silence, nodded. “It fits the facts, Mr. Holmes. I will have him arrested at once.”\n\nHolmes smiled. “You will find that he cannot account for his movements on the night of the murder. And you will find the weapon hidden in his room.”\n\nThe case was soon brought to a conclusion. The brother was arrested, and the evidence against him was overwhelming. He confessed to the crime, and was brought to justice.\n\nAs we left the house, Holmes turned to me with a smile. “You see, Watson, it is always the little things that are most important. The behaviour of the dog was the key to the whole mystery.”\n\nI nodded. “You were right, Holmes. As always.”\n\nAnd so another case was added to the long list of Holmes’s triumphs, and I was once more reminded of the extraordinary powers of observation and deduction which made him the greatest detective of his age."

In spite of the light brown dustcoat and leather-leggings which he wore in deference to his rustic surroundings, I had no difficulty in recognising Lestrade, of Scotland Yard. With him we drove to the Hereford Arms where a room had already been engaged for us.\n“I have ordered a carriage,” said Lestrade as we sat over a cup of tea. “I knew your energetic nature, and that you would not be happy until you had been on the scene of the crime.”\n“It was very nice and complimentary of you,” Holmes answered. “It is entirely a question of barometric pressure.”\nLestrade looked startled. “I do not quite follow,” he said.\n“How is the glass? Twenty-nine, I see. No wind, and not a cloud in the sky. I have a caseful of cigarettes here which need smoking, and the sofa is very much superior to the usual country hotel abomination. I do not think that it is probable that I shall use the carriage to-night.”\nLestrade laughed indulgently. “You have, no doubt, already formed your conclusions from the newspapers,” he said. “The case is as plain as a pikestaff, and the more one goes into it the plainer it becomes. Still, of course, one can’t refuse a lady, and such a very positive one, too. She has heard of you, and would have your opinion, though I repeatedly told her that there was nothing which you could do which I had not already done. Why, bless my soul! here is her carriage at the door.”\nHe had hardly spoken before there rushed into the room one of the most lovely young women that I have ever seen in my life. Her violet eyes shining, her lips parted, a pink flush upon her cheeks, all thought of her natural reserve lost in her overpowering excitement and concern.\n“Oh, Mr. Sherlock Holmes!” she cried, glancing from one to the other of us, and finally, with a woman’s quick intuition, fastening upon my companion, “I am so glad that you have come. I have driven down to tell you so. I know that James didn’t do it. I know it, and I want you to start upon your work knowing it, too. Never let yourself doubt upon that point. We have known each other since we were little children, and I know his faults as no one else does; but he is too tender-hearted to hurt a fly. Such a charge is absurd to anyone who really knows him.”\n“I hope we may clear him, Miss Turner,” said Sherlock Holmes. “You may rely upon my doing all that I can.”\n“But you have read the evidence. You have formed some conclusion? Do you not see some loophole, some flaw? Do you not yourself think that he is innocent?”\n“I think that it is very probable.”\n“There, now!” she cried, throwing back her head and looking defiantly at Lestrade. “You hear! He gives me hopes.”\nLestrade shrugged his shoulders. “I am afraid that my colleague has been a little quick in forming his conclusions,” he said.\n“But he is right. Oh! I know that he is right. James never did it. And about his quarrel with his father, I am sure that the reason why he would not speak about it to the coroner was because I was concerned in it.”\n“In what way?” asked Holmes.\n“It is no time for me to hide anything. James and his father had many disagreements about me. Mr. McCarthy was very anxious that there should be a marriage between us. James and I have always loved each other as brother and sister; but of course he is young and has seen very little of life yet, and—and—well, he naturally did not wish to do anything like that yet. So there were quarrels, and this, I am sure, was one of them.”\n“And your father?” asked Holmes. “Was he in favour of such a union?”\n“No, he was averse to it also. No one but Mr. McCarthy was in favour of it.” A quick blush passed over her fresh young face as Holmes shot one of his keen, questioning glances at her.\n“Thank you for this information,” said he. “May I see your father if I call to-morrow?”\n“I am afraid the doctor won’t allow it.”\n“The doctor?”\n“Yes, have you not heard? Poor father has never been strong for years back, but this has broken him down completely. He has taken to his bed, and Dr. Willows says that he is a wreck and that his nervous system is shattered. Mr. McCarthy was the only man alive who had known dad in the old days in Victoria.”\n“Ha! In Victoria! That is important.”\n“Yes, at the mines.”\n“Quite so; at the gold-mines, where, as I understand, Mr. Turner made his money.”\n“Yes, certainly.”\n“Thank you, Miss Turner. You have been of material assistance to me.”\n“You will tell me if you have any news to-morrow. No doubt you will go to the prison to see James. Oh, if you do, Mr. Holmes, do tell him that I know him to be innocent.”\n“I will, Miss Turner.”\n“I must go home now, for dad is very ill, and he misses me so if I leave him. Good-bye, and God help you in your undertaking.” She hurried from the room as impulsively as she had entered, and we heard the wheels of her carriage rattle off down the street.",

            "prefix-probing": "The countryside was bathed in the mellow light of the afternoon, and the air was fresh with the scent of early summer. Holmes, who had been silent for much of the journey, now roused himself and looked about with keen interest as the train drew up at the small station. We alighted, and our luggage was quickly transferred to a waiting fly, which was to convey us to the residence of Dr. Mortimer, whose letter had so urgently summoned us from London.\n\nAs we drove through the winding lanes, Holmes leaned forward, his sharp eyes taking in every detail of the landscape. The hedgerows were thick with wildflowers, and the distant hills rolled away in gentle undulations. Presently, we turned into a gravelled drive, at the end of which stood a modest but comfortable-looking house, half-covered in climbing roses.\n\nDr. Mortimer himself met us at the door, a tall, thin man with a gentle, scholarly air. He greeted us warmly, though his manner was tinged with a certain nervousness, as though the burden of his mysterious problem weighed heavily upon him.\n\n\"Mr. Holmes, Dr. Watson, I cannot tell you how grateful I am that you have come,\" he said, ushering us into a cosy sitting-room. \"The matter is of the utmost urgency, and I fear that every hour may be of consequence.\"\n\nHolmes seated himself in an armchair, steepling his fingers and regarding our host with his usual air of quiet concentration. \"Pray, Dr. Mortimer, let us come at once to the point. You spoke in your letter of a singular occurrence which has greatly disturbed you.\"\n\nDr. Mortimer nodded, and after a moment's hesitation, he produced a folded document from his pocket. \"It is this, Mr. Holmes. I received it three days ago, and since then I have scarcely known a moment's peace.\"\n\nHe handed the paper to Holmes, who unfolded it and examined it closely. It was a sheet of plain, unmarked paper, upon which a few words had been printed in rough, uneven characters:\n\n\"If you value your life or your reason, keep away from the moor.\"\n\nHolmes read the message aloud, then turned it over in his hands. \"There is no signature, no indication of the sender?\"\n\n\"None whatever. It was delivered by the morning post, and the envelope bore the Ross postmark.\"\n\nHolmes nodded thoughtfully. \"And what, may I ask, is the significance of the moor in this context?\"\n\nDr. Mortimer hesitated, glancing nervously at the window as though half-expecting to see some shadowy figure lurking outside. \"The moor, Mr. Holmes, is the scene of the recent tragedy which has so unsettled us all. It was there that Sir Charles Baskerville met his untimely end.\"\n\nAt the mention of the name, Holmes's eyes gleamed with interest. \"Ah, yes, the Baskerville case. I have read something of it in the papers. A most peculiar affair.\"\n\n\"Peculiar indeed,\" said Dr. Mortimer gravely. \"Sir Charles was a man of robust constitution, yet he was found dead upon the path leading to the old yew alley, his features contorted in an expression of the utmost terror. The coroner returned a verdict of death from natural causes, but there are those who believe that something more sinister was at work.\"\n\nHolmes leaned forward, his interest evidently aroused. \"You yourself, Dr. Mortimer, do you share that belief?\"\n\nDr. Mortimer hesitated. \"I am a man of science, Mr. Holmes, and yet I cannot dismiss the strange circumstances which attended Sir Charles's death. There were footprints—footprints of a gigantic hound—found near the body. And then there is the legend of the Baskerville family, which has cast a shadow over the house for generations.\"\n\nHolmes smiled faintly. \"You refer, I presume, to the story of the spectral hound which is said to haunt the moor?\"\n\n\"Precisely. I know it sounds fantastic, but the people here believe it implicitly. And now, with this warning, I fear that the danger is not yet past. Sir Henry Baskerville, the heir, is due to arrive from Canada, and I dread to think what may befall him if he takes up residence at Baskerville Hall.\"\n\nHolmes was silent for a moment, his gaze fixed upon the cryptic message. At length he spoke. \"You have done wisely in consulting me, Dr. Mortimer. There are certainly elements in this case which call for the most careful investigation. I shall be pleased to place myself at your disposal.\"\n\nDr. Mortimer's face brightened. \"Thank you, Mr. Holmes. I feel sure that with your help we may yet avert a tragedy.\"\n\nHolmes rose and paced the room, his hands clasped behind his back. \"There are several points which require clarification. First, the nature of the warning. It is clearly intended to frighten Sir Henry away from the moor. Second, the circumstances of Sir Charles's death, and the evidence of the hound. Third, the legend itself, and its possible bearing upon the present situation.\"\n\nHe turned to Dr. Mortimer. \"I should like to visit the scene of the tragedy, and to examine any evidence which may have been overlooked.\"\n\n\"Of course, Mr. Holmes. I shall be happy to accompany you.\"\n\n\"Excellent. And now, Dr. Mortimer, I should be glad if you would give me a full account of the events leading up to Sir Charles's death, and of any incidents which may have occurred since.\"\n\nDr. Mortimer nodded, and began his narrative, his voice low and earnest as he recounted the strange happenings which had brought us to this quiet corner of the countryside. Holmes listened intently, his keen mind already at work upon the tangled threads of the mystery."

We have still time to take a train to Hereford and see him to-night?”\n“Ample.”\n“Then let us do so. Watson, I fear that you will find it very slow, but I shall only be away a couple of hours.”\nI walked down to the station with them, and then wandered through the streets of the little town, finally returning to the hotel, where I lay upon the sofa and tried to interest myself in a yellow-backed novel. The puny plot of the story was so thin, however, when compared to the deep mystery through which we were groping, and I found my attention wander so continually from the action to the fact, that I at last flung it across the room and gave myself up entirely to a consideration of the events of the day. Supposing that this unhappy young man’s story were absolutely true, then what hellish thing, what absolutely unforeseen and extraordinary calamity could have occurred between the time when he parted from his father, and the moment when, drawn back by his screams, he rushed into the glade? It was something terrible and deadly. What could it be? Might not the nature of the injuries reveal something to my medical instincts? I rang the bell and called for the weekly county paper, which contained a verbatim account of the inquest. In the surgeon’s deposition it was stated that the posterior third of the left parietal bone and the left half of the occipital bone had been shattered by a heavy blow from a blunt weapon. I marked the spot upon my own head. Clearly such a blow must have been struck from behind. That was to some extent in favour of the accused, as when seen quarrelling he was face to face with his father. Still, it did not go for very much, for the older man might have turned his back before the blow fell. Still, it might be worth while to call Holmes’ attention to it. Then there was the peculiar dying reference to a rat. What could that mean? It could not be delirium. A man dying from a sudden blow does not commonly become delirious. No, it was more likely to be an attempt to explain how he met his fate. But what could it indicate? I cudgelled my brains to find some possible explanation. And then the incident of the grey cloth seen by young McCarthy. If that were true the murderer must have dropped some part of his dress, presumably his overcoat, in his flight, and must have had the hardihood to return and to carry it away at the instant when the son was kneeling with his back turned not a dozen paces off. What a tissue of mysteries and improbabilities the whole thing was! I did not wonder at Lestrade’s opinion, and yet I had so much faith in Sherlock Holmes’ insight that I could not lose hope as long as every fresh fact seemed to strengthen his conviction of young McCarthy’s innocence.",

It was clear, however, that the blow had been struck from behind, and yet there was the evidence of the people who had seen father and son together, and who had heard the father's dying words. What did they mean? Had he, in his last delirium, tried to name his murderer? Or was it a mere incoherent babble? I turned to the medical evidence, as given in the inquest report. There was a strong presumption that the blow had been struck from behind. The injury was on the left side, and behind the ear.

Another point which was made clear in the inquest was the singular dying reference to a rat. What could that mean? It could not be delirium. A sudden blow does not produce delirium.

            "prefix-probing": "“I am ashamed of you, Holmes,” said Lestrade with dignity after a few minutes’ silence. “Why should you be, Lestrade?” Holmes asked, his tone mild but his eyes glinting with amusement. “Because you make a mockery of the police force. You treat this investigation as if it were a game, and yet you expect us to take your word for everything.”\n\nHolmes smiled, unperturbed. “My dear Lestrade, I assure you, I have the greatest respect for the police force. But you must admit, there are times when a little imagination is required.”\n\nLestrade sniffed. “Imagination is all very well, but it won’t stand up in court. We need facts, Holmes. Facts and evidence.”\n\n“Quite so,” Holmes agreed. “And I believe you will find that the facts, when properly examined, will point in the direction I have indicated.”\n\nLestrade shook his head. “You’re too clever by half, Holmes. One day you’ll go too far.”\n\nHolmes only smiled again, and turned his attention back to the small object he held in his hand. It was a curious thing, a piece of twisted metal, no larger than a coin, but with a peculiar pattern etched into its surface. He examined it closely, turning it over and over between his long, slender fingers.\n\nWatson, who had been watching the exchange in silence, now spoke up. “Holmes, do you really believe this is the key to the whole affair?”\n\n“I do, Watson,” Holmes replied. “It is often the smallest detail that unlocks the greatest mystery. Consider, for example, the curious incident of the dog in the night-time.”\n\nLestrade frowned. “What dog? There was no dog.”\n\n“Precisely,” said Holmes, with a twinkle in his eye. “The absence of the dog’s bark is itself a fact, and a most significant one.”\n\nLestrade looked unconvinced, but Watson nodded thoughtfully. “I see what you mean, Holmes. Sometimes what does not happen is as important as what does.”\n\n“Exactly, my dear Watson. Now, if you will permit me, I believe we should pay a visit to Mr. Jabez Wilson. There are one or two questions I should like to put to him.”\n\nLestrade sighed, but he knew better than to argue with Holmes when he was in this mood. “Very well, Holmes. Lead the way.”\n\nThe three men left the small office and made their way through the bustling streets of London. The fog was thick, and the gas lamps cast long, wavering shadows on the pavement. Holmes walked briskly, his keen eyes darting from side to side, taking in every detail.\n\nAt last they arrived at the pawnbroker’s shop. Mr. Wilson greeted them nervously, his round face pale and anxious.\n\n“Mr. Holmes! Have you discovered anything?”\n\nHolmes smiled reassuringly. “I believe I have, Mr. Wilson. But I must ask you a few more questions. Tell me, did you notice anything unusual about your assistant, Mr. Spaulding, in the days leading up to the incident?”\n\nWilson thought for a moment. “Well, now that you mention it, he did seem rather preoccupied. He was always in the cellar, you know, working on some project or other.”\n\n“Indeed,” said Holmes. “And did you ever see what he was doing down there?”\n\nWilson shook his head. “No, he always said it was private business.”\n\nHolmes nodded. “Thank you, Mr. Wilson. That will be all for now.”\n\nAs they left the shop, Lestrade turned to Holmes. “Well, Holmes? What do you make of it?”\n\nHolmes smiled. “I think, Lestrade, that we are very close to the solution. All that remains is to catch the criminals in the act.”\n\nLestrade looked skeptical, but he followed Holmes and Watson as they set off into the foggy night, ready to bring the case to its dramatic conclusion."

He came back alone, for Lestrade was staying in lodgings in the town.\n“The glass still keeps very high,” he remarked as he sat down. “It is of importance that it should not rain before we are able to go over the ground. On the other hand, a man should be at his very best and keenest for such nice work as that, and I did not wish to do it when fagged by a long journey. I have seen young McCarthy.”\n“And what did you learn from him?”\n“Nothing.”\n“Could he throw no light?”\n“None at all. I was inclined to think at one time that he knew who had done it and was screening him or her, but I am convinced now that he is as puzzled as everyone else. He is not a very quick-witted youth, though comely to look at and, I should think, sound at heart.”\n“I cannot admire his taste,” I remarked, “if it is indeed a fact that he was averse to a marriage with so charming a young lady as this Miss Turner.”\n“Ah, thereby hangs a rather painful tale. This fellow is madly, insanely, in love with her, but some two years ago, when he was only a lad, and before he really knew her, for she had been away five years at a boarding-school, what does the idiot do but get into the clutches of a barmaid in Bristol and marry her at a registry office? No one knows a word of the matter, but you can imagine how maddening it must be to him to be upbraided for not doing what he would give his very eyes to do, but what he knows to be absolutely impossible. It was sheer frenzy of this sort which made him throw his hands up into the air when his father, at their last interview, was goading him on to propose to Miss Turner. On the other hand, he had no means of supporting himself, and his father, who was by all accounts a very hard man, would have thrown him over utterly had he known the truth. It was with his barmaid wife that he had spent the last three days in Bristol, and his father did not know where he was. Mark that point. It is of importance. Good has come out of evil, however, for the barmaid, finding from the papers that he is in serious trouble and likely to be hanged, has thrown him over utterly and has written to him to say that she has a husband already in the Bermuda Dockyard, so that there is really no tie between them. I think that that bit of news has consoled young McCarthy for all that he has suffered.”\n“But if he is innocent, who has done it?”\n“Ah! who? I would call your attention very particularly to two points. One is that the murdered man had an appointment with someone at the pool, and that the someone could not have been his son, for his son was away, and he did not know when he would return. The second is that the murdered man was heard to cry ‘Cooee!’ before he knew that his son had returned. Those are the crucial points upon which the case depends. And now let us talk about George Meredith, if you please, and we shall leave all minor matters until to-morrow.”",

He had been out alone, and I was surprised at seeing him so, for I had expected that he would be accompanied by Lestrade. “Oh, he is insatiable in his curiosity,” remarked Holmes, as he threw himself into an armchair. “He has had me at it all day. He is not a bad fellow, though an absolute imbecile in his profession. I have had to come back alone, for I have a few lines of thought to work out by myself. The atmosphere tonight is exceptionally clear, and I am glad of it, for tomorrow will be a critical day in our investigation.”\n\nI asked him if he had seen young McCarthy. “Yes, I saw him for a moment,” said Holmes. “I found that he had nothing to add to the statements he has already made. He is not a very quick-witted youth, though comely to look at and, I should think, sound at heart.”\n\n“I cannot admire his taste,” I remarked, “if it is indeed true that he was averse to a marriage with so charming a young lady as Miss Turner.”\n\n“Ah, Watson,” said Holmes, “this is a very deep business. There are a string of strange circumstances, and many things are to be taken into consideration. Young McCarthy does not wish to marry Miss Turner, and for a very good reason. He is already married.”\n\nMy astonishment was unfeigned. “Already married?”\n\n“Yes. He married a barmaid at Bristol when he was little more than a lad. It was a secret and foolish affair, and he has bitterly repented it. The girl’s father was a man of some position, and the marriage was kept secret. Miss Turner was at school at the time, and he did not know her. When she returned, he fell in love with her, but the existence of his wife made any proposal impossible. His father’s insistence upon the match drove him almost to distraction, and that was the cause of the scene which was witnessed by the gamekeeper. He could not tell his father the truth, for he was entirely dependent upon him. Mark that point. It is of the utmost importance.

He came back in a very different mood from that which he had left us. It had been a bright, clear day, and the little barometer was rising steadily. “It is a capital night for our purpose,” he said, as he glanced at the sky. “I shall be able to see tomorrow what the ground has to show. I could not do it tonight, for I was too weary. I have seen young McCarthy.”\n\n“And what did you learn from him?”\n\n“Nothing.”\n\n“Could he throw no light?”\n\n“None at all.

He is not a very quick-witted youth, though comely to look at and, I should think, sound at heart.”\n\n“I cannot admire his taste,” I remarked, “if it is indeed true that he was averse to a marriage with so charming a young lady as Miss Turner.”\n\n“Ah, Watson, that is the only point in his favour. He would have been a great fool if he had not been, for Miss Turner is a very charming young lady. But the matter is more serious than I thought. Young McCarthy had been secretly married to a barmaid at Bristol. The marriage took place two years ago, when he was little more than a lad, and before he knew Miss Turner, who had been away at school. His father’s insistence upon the match made him desperate. He could not tell his father the truth, for he was entirely dependent upon him. Mark that point. It is of the utmost importance. He had spent three days in Bristol with his wife before the murder, and his father did not know where he was. Now, mark that again. His father did not know where he was.”\n\n“But how was the secret marriage discovered?”\n\n“The barmaid, seeing the reports in the papers, wrote to him to say that she had a husband living, and that their marriage was therefore void.

I was sitting in my armchair by the fire, reading the evening paper, when he entered, looking more worn and haggard than I had ever seen him. His keen eyes, however, were as bright as ever, and there was a suppressed excitement in his manner which told me that he was on the track of the solution.\n\n\"You have been to the scene of the crime, Holmes?\" I asked, laying aside my paper.\n\n\"Yes, Watson. I have been to Brixton Road, and I have made some progress. The case is a singular one, and I confess that it has presented more difficulties than I anticipated. But I think we are on the right scent now.\"\n\nHe threw himself into a chair and stretched his long legs out before him. For a few moments he was silent, his eyes fixed on the glowing embers in the grate. Then he turned to me with a sudden energy.\n\n\"You remember the details of the case, Watson?\"\n\n\"Perfectly. The murdered man, Enoch Drebber, was found in an empty house in Brixton Road. There were no signs of robbery, and the word 'RACHE' was written in blood upon the wall.\"\n\n\"Exactly. And what do you make of it?\"\n\nI hesitated. \"It is a most mysterious affair. The writing on the wall seems to point to some secret society, perhaps something German.\"\n\nHolmes smiled. \"That is the obvious conclusion, and yet I am not satisfied. There are other factors to be considered. For instance, the ring which was found at the scene.\"\n\n\"The wedding ring?\"\n\n\"Yes. It is a woman's ring, and it is of some importance. I have made inquiries, and I believe I have traced its owner.\"\n\n\"Indeed! That is a step forward.\"\n\n\"It is. But there is more. I have also discovered that Drebber was being followed on the night of his death.\"\n\n\"By whom?\"\n\n\"That is what I am trying to ascertain. I have a theory, but I need more evidence.\"\n\nHe rose and began to pace the room, his hands clasped behind his back.\n\n\"The case is complicated by the presence of Drebber's companion, Joseph Stangerson. He has disappeared, and the police are searching for him.\"\n\n\"Do you think he is implicated?\"\n\n\"It is possible. But I am not convinced. There are too many unexplained details. For example, the manner in which Drebber was killed. There was no wound, no sign of violence, and yet he is dead.\"\n\n\"Poison, perhaps?\"\n\n\"That is my belief. But the method is unusual. I have sent for a chemical analysis of the stains found at the scene.\"\n\nHe paused and looked at me intently.\n\n\"Watson, I have a feeling that we are dealing with a case of revenge. The word 'RACHE' means 'revenge' in German. But I do not think it was written by a German. It was meant to mislead.\"\n\n\"Then who wrote it?\"\n\n\"That is what we must discover. I have a plan, Watson. Tomorrow, I shall set a trap. If my suspicions are correct, we shall have our man before the day is out.\"\n\nHe sat down again, his face alight with anticipation. I could see that the chase was on, and that Sherlock Holmes was in his element."

At nine o’clock Lestrade called for us with the carriage, and we set off for Hatherley Farm and the Boscombe Pool.\n“There is serious news this morning,” Lestrade observed. “It is said that Mr. Turner, of the Hall, is so ill that his life is despaired of.”\n“An elderly man, I presume?” said Holmes.\n“About sixty; but his constitution has been shattered by his life abroad, and he has been in failing health for some time. This business has had a very bad effect upon him. He was an old friend of McCarthy’s, and, I may add, a great benefactor to him, for I have learned that he gave him Hatherley Farm rent free.”\n“Indeed! That is interesting,” said Holmes.\n“Oh, yes! In a hundred other ways he has helped him. Everybody about here speaks of his kindness to him.”\n“Really! Does it not strike you as a little singular that this McCarthy, who appears to have had little of his own, and to have been under such obligations to Turner, should still talk of marrying his son to Turner’s daughter, who is, presumably, heiress to the estate, and that in such a very cocksure manner, as if it were merely a case of a proposal and all else would follow? It is the more strange, since we know that Turner himself was averse to the idea. The daughter told us as much. Do you not deduce something from that?”\n“We have got to the deductions and the inferences,” said Lestrade, winking at me. “I find it hard enough to tackle facts, Holmes, without flying away after theories and fancies.”\n“You are right,” said Holmes demurely; “you do find it very hard to tackle the facts.”\n“Anyhow, I have grasped one fact which you seem to find it difficult to get hold of,” replied Lestrade with some warmth.\n“And that is—”\n“That McCarthy senior met his death from McCarthy junior and that all theories to the contrary are the merest moonshine.”\n“Well, moonshine is a brighter thing than fog,” said Holmes, laughing. “But I am very much mistaken if this is not Hatherley Farm upon the left.”\n“Yes, that is it.” It was a widespread, comfortable-looking building, two-storied, slate-roofed, with great yellow blotches of lichen upon the grey walls. The drawn blinds and the smokeless chimneys, however, gave it a stricken look, as though the weight of this horror still lay heavy upon it. We called at the door, when the maid, at Holmes’ request, showed us the boots which her master wore at the time of his death, and also a pair of the son’s, though not the pair which he had then had. Having measured these very carefully from seven or eight different points, Holmes desired to be led to the court-yard, from which we all followed the winding track which led to Boscombe Pool.\nSherlock Holmes was transformed when he was hot upon such a scent as this. Men who had only known the quiet thinker and logician of Baker Street would have failed to recognise him. His face flushed and darkened. His brows were drawn into two hard black lines, while his eyes shone out from beneath them with a steely glitter. His face was bent downward, his shoulders bowed, his lips compressed, and the veins stood out like whipcord in his long, sinewy neck. His nostrils seemed to dilate with a purely animal lust for the chase, and his mind was so absolutely concentrated upon the matter before him that a question or remark fell unheeded upon his ears, or, at the most, only provoked a quick, impatient snarl in reply. Swiftly and silently he made his way along the track which ran through the meadows, and so by way of the woods to the Boscombe Pool. It was damp, marshy ground, as is all that district, and there were marks of many feet, both upon the path and amid the short grass which bounded it on either side. Sometimes Holmes would hurry on, sometimes stop dead, and once he made quite a little detour into the meadow. Lestrade and I walked behind him, the detective indifferent and contemptuous, while I watched my friend with the interest which sprang from the conviction that every one of his actions was directed towards a definite end.\nThe Boscombe Pool, which is a little reed-girt sheet of water some fifty yards across, is situated at the boundary between the Hatherley Farm and the private park of the wealthy Mr. Turner. Above the woods which lined it upon the farther side we could see the red, jutting pinnacles which marked the site of the rich landowner’s dwelling. On the Hatherley side of the pool the woods grew very thick, and there was a narrow belt of sodden grass twenty paces across between the edge of the trees and the reeds which lined the lake. Lestrade showed us the exact spot at which the body had been found, and, indeed, so moist was the ground, that I could plainly see the traces which had been left by the fall of the stricken man. To Holmes, as I could see by his eager face and peering eyes, very many other things were to be read upon the trampled grass. He ran round, like a dog who is picking up a scent, and then turned upon my companion.\n“What did you go into the pool for?” he asked.\n“I fished about with a rake. I thought there might be some weapon or other trace. But how on earth—”\n“Oh, tut, tut! I have no time! That left foot of yours with its inward twist is all over the place. A mole could trace it, and there it vanishes among the reeds. Oh, how simple it would all have been had I been here before they came like a herd of buffalo and wallowed all over it. Here is where the party with the lodge-keeper came, and they have covered all tracks for six or eight feet round the body. But here are three separate tracks of the same feet.” He drew out a lens and lay down upon his waterproof to have a better view, talking all the time rather to himself than to us. “These are young McCarthy’s feet. Twice he was walking, and once he ran swiftly, so that the soles are deeply marked and the heels hardly visible. That bears out his story. He ran when he saw his father on the ground. Then here are the father’s feet as he paced up and down. What is this, then? It is the butt-end of the gun as the son stood listening. And this? Ha, ha! What have we here? Tiptoes! tiptoes! Square, too, quite unusual boots! They come, they go, they come again—of course that was for the cloak. Now where did they come from?” He ran up and down, sometimes losing, sometimes finding the track until we were well within the edge of the wood and under the shadow of a great beech, the largest tree in the neighbourhood. Holmes traced his way to the farther side of this and lay down once more upon his face with a little cry of satisfaction. For a long time he remained there, turning over the leaves and dried sticks, gathering up what seemed to me to be dust into an envelope and examining with his lens not only the ground but even the bark of the tree as far as he could reach. A jagged stone was lying among the moss, and this also he carefully examined and retained. Then he followed a pathway through the wood until he came to the high road, where all traces were lost.\n“It has been a case of considerable interest,” he remarked, returning to his natural manner. “I fancy that this grey house on the right must be the lodge. I think that I will go in and have a word with Moran, and perhaps write a little note. Having done that, we may drive back to our luncheon. You may walk to the cab, and I shall be with you presently.”",

At nine o’clock Lestrade called for us with the carriage, and we set off for Hatherley Farm and the Boscombe Pool. \n\n“There is serious news this morning,” Lestrade observed. “Mr. Turner is so ill that his doctor fears he may not live. He was an old friend of McCarthy’s, and, I may add, a great benefactor to him, for I have learned that he gave him Hatherley Farm rent free.”\n\n“Indeed! That is interesting,” said Holmes.\n\n“Oh, yes! In a hundred other ways he has helped him. Everybody about here speaks of his kindness to him.”\n\n“Yet, I suppose, that McCarthy was none the less anxious to get his son married to Miss Turner, and that he pressed the matter on more than one occasion?”\n\n“Yes, he did,” said Lestrade. “I have learned that from several sources. But, however that may be, I think that the facts are pretty clear as they stand.”\n\n“And yet, for all that, the case is not clear to me,” said Holmes.\n\n“The fact is,” remarked Lestrade, “that you are like a dog with a bone. You will not let it go.”\n\n“Now, Mr. Lestrade, I really have no time for this. I have to be at the farm by ten o’clock, and I want to have a look at the boots which McCarthy wore and at his son’s boots as well.”\n\nWe drove to the farm, and Holmes made a very careful examination of the boots, measuring them with the tape which he always carried. Then we set off along the path to the Boscombe Pool. Holmes was transformed when he was hot upon such a scent as this. He was so swift, silent, and furtive in his movements, like a bloodhound picking out a scent, that I could not but think what a terrible criminal he would have made had he turned his energy and sagacity against the law instead of exerting them in its defence. He ran up and down, sometimes stopping, sometimes whirling round, sometimes crouching as if to engage in a wrestling match with the ground, with his long, thin nose only a few inches from the surface, and his keen, grey eyes darting to right and left. The rest of us stood watching him in silence, for we had no part in what he was doing. The Maid had come up with us, and she stood with her hands clasped, watching the strange proceedings.\n\nAt the edge of the pool Lestrade pointed out the exact spot where the body had been found, and Holmes, after a long and minute examination, began to walk slowly round the edge of the water. He stopped once or twice and made a few notes in his notebook. Then he turned to Lestrade.\n\n“Did you, by any chance, move the body before the police arrived?”\n\n“No, I waited until they came.”\n\n“Did you see any marks on the ground?”\n\n“Nothing of any importance.”\n\n“I am afraid there are a good many marks of boots about here,” he said, “but since the police have been here, there have probably been a good many people on the ground.”\n\n“Yes, there are a good many tracks,” Lestrade admitted. “But I think that we can disregard all the footprints of those who came after the police.”\n\nHolmes gave a little cry of satisfaction, and, bending down, he examined the ground with his lens. “This is quite a pretty demonstration,” he said. “There are three sets of tracks clearly marked. One is the track of McCarthy himself, going to the pool. The second is that of his son, coming and going. The third is a peculiar one, with square-toed boots. I have seen the same tracks at the hall door. Now, Watson, let us see who else has been here.”\n\nHe ran along, stooping and peering, and then turned suddenly into the wood. “Here are the tracks again,” he said, pointing to the ground. “He seems to have come in this direction.”\n\nHe followed the path through the wood, and then, under a great beech tree, he stopped and examined the ground and the bark of the tree. “I have seen all I wish,” said he. “Now we can go back to the house.”\n\n“By the way, Lestrade,” he added, as we walked back, “I suppose you have no objection to my having a look at the stone which struck McCarthy?”\n\n“Not at all. It is in the office.”\n\n“Show me to it.”\n\nWe went together to the office, and Holmes examined the jagged stone with great attention. “Thank you,” said he. “May I keep this stone for a little?”\n\n“Certainly.”\n\n“Come, Watson, I think that we have done all that we can here. I would like to have a word with Moran at the lodge before we go back to lunch.”",

            "prefix-probing": "Everywhere the birds were singing, and there was a cheerfulness in the air which set the last seal upon the nature of a perfect English spring day. Holmes and I had breakfasted, and he was already deep in the study of the morning papers, when a knock sounded at the door. It was our client, Miss Mary Sutherland, who had come to hear the result of our investigations. She was looking pale and anxious, and her eyes were red with weeping.\n\n\"Good-morning, Miss Sutherland,\" said Holmes, rising and bowing with that easy courtesy for which he was remarkable. \"Pray take a seat. Have you any news for us?\"\n\n\"No, Mr. Holmes; I have heard nothing since I saw you last.\"\n\n\"I have some news for you, then. I have solved your case.\"\n\nMiss Sutherland started and looked at him with an expression of mingled hope and fear. \"You have found him?\" she gasped.\n\n\"Yes, I have found him.\"\n\n\"Oh, Mr. Holmes, can you bring him back to me?\"\n\n\"I am afraid that is quite out of the question.\"\n\n\"But why should he have done this cruel thing?\"\n\n\"Because he loved you, Miss Sutherland. If he had not loved you, he would not have run away.\"\n\nShe looked at him in bewilderment. \"I do not understand.\"\n\nHolmes leaned forward and laid his long, thin fingers together. \"It is a very simple case, Miss Sutherland, very simple indeed. You will excuse me for not taking you into my confidence earlier, but I feared that I might raise hopes which could never be realized.\"\n\n\"But how did you find out?\"\n\n\"I have my own methods. But let us go over the facts once more. Your stepfather, Mr. Windibank, objected to your marriage with Mr. Hosmer Angel. He was a man of strong character, and he had his own reasons for wishing you to remain at home.\"\n\n\"Yes, he always said that he could not bear to part with me.\"\n\n\"Exactly. Now, when Mr. Hosmer Angel appeared upon the scene, your stepfather was away in France. He returned, and at once Mr. Angel disappeared.\"\n\n\"Yes, but I do not see—\"\n\n\"You do not see because you are not looking in the right direction. The person who disappeared was not Mr. Hosmer Angel, but Mr. Windibank himself.\"\n\nShe stared at him in amazement. \"But Mr. Windibank was at home.\"\n\n\"He was at home, but he was also Mr. Hosmer Angel. It was a clever disguise, but not clever enough. The glasses, the whiskers, the voice—all were intended to mislead you. But I saw through it from the first.\"\n\nMiss Sutherland sank back in her chair, her hands clasped together. \"Oh, it is impossible!\" she cried. \"It cannot be!\"\n\n\"It is true, nevertheless. I have written to Mr. Windibank, and I have no doubt that he will confirm what I say.\"\n\nThere was a silence, broken only by the ticking of the clock upon the mantelpiece. At last Miss Sutherland rose and took her leave, her face pale but resolute. Holmes watched her go with a look of mingled pity and admiration.\n\n\"She will be all right,\" he said, turning to me. \"There is a spirit in that woman which will carry her through anything. She will never marry now, for she has had her heart broken, but she will be a better woman for it.\"\n\nI could not but admire the way in which Holmes had unravelled the tangled skein of this strange case. It was a triumph of his peculiar method, and I felt that I had been privileged to witness a master at work.\n\nAs we sat together in the quiet of our rooms, I could not help but reflect upon the curious nature of human affairs, and the strange twists and turns which fate can take. Holmes, for his part, seemed content to let the matter rest, and soon turned his attention to other cases which demanded his unique talents.\n\nThus ended the case of the disappearing bridegroom, one of the most singular and interesting of all the adventures which I have had the privilege of sharing with my remarkable friend, Sherlock Holmes."

The cab rattled over the uneven road, and I could not help but notice the intensity with which my friend examined his find, turning it over and over in his slender fingers. The countryside slipped by, the hedgerows and fields bathed in the golden light of late afternoon, but Holmes seemed oblivious to all but the object in his hand.\n\nAt last, as we approached the outskirts of the town, Holmes spoke. \"You observed, Watson, the peculiar markings upon this stone?\" he asked, holding it up for my inspection. I leaned forward, peering at the surface, and saw faint scratches and a curious indentation along one edge.\n\n\"I confess, Holmes, that I see nothing remarkable,\" I replied. \"It appears to be an ordinary stone, perhaps chipped by some farm implement.\"\n\nHolmes smiled faintly. \"That is precisely what one might think at first glance. But consider, Watson, the position in which it was found, and the circumstances surrounding our case. This stone did not arrive in the wood by accident.\"\n\nHe slipped the stone into his pocket as the cab drew up before the inn where we had taken rooms. We alighted, and Holmes led the way inside, his manner brisk and purposeful. Once in our sitting-room, he placed the stone upon the table and fetched his magnifying lens from his satchel.\n\n\"Now, Watson, let us see what secrets you conceal,\" he murmured, bending over the stone. I watched as he examined it minutely, his brow furrowed in concentration. After several minutes, he straightened and looked at me with a gleam in his eye.\n\n\"As I suspected,\" he said. \"This is no ordinary stone, but a fragment of granite from the very quarry which supplied the foundation of the manor. Note the lichen upon its surface, and the manner in which it has been struck. It was used, Watson, as a weapon.\"\n\nI started in surprise. \"A weapon? But against whom?\"\n\nHolmes tapped the stone thoughtfully. \"That, my dear Watson, is what we must now determine. But I believe we are one step closer to the truth.\""

His slow, limping step and bowed shoulders gave the appearance of decrepitude, and yet his hard, deep-lined, craggy features, and his enormous limbs showed that he was possessed of unusual strength of body and of character. His tangled beard, grizzled hair, and outstanding, drooping eyebrows combined to give an air of dignity and power to his appearance, but his face was of an ashen white, while his lips and the corners of his nostrils were tinged with a shade of blue. It was clear to me at a glance that he was in the grip of some deadly and chronic disease.\n“Pray sit down on the sofa,” said Holmes gently. “You had my note?”\n“Yes, the lodge-keeper brought it up. You said that you wished to see me here to avoid scandal.”\n“I thought people would talk if I went to the Hall.”\n“And why did you wish to see me?” He looked across at my companion with despair in his weary eyes, as though his question was already answered.\n“Yes,” said Holmes, answering the look rather than the words. “It is so. I know all about McCarthy.”\nThe old man sank his face in his hands. “God help me!” he cried. “But I would not have let the young man come to harm. I give you my word that I would have spoken out if it went against him at the Assizes.”\n“I am glad to hear you say so,” said Holmes gravely.\n“I would have spoken now had it not been for my dear girl. It would break her heart—it will break her heart when she hears that I am arrested.”\n“It may not come to that,” said Holmes.\n“What?”\n“I am no official agent. I understand that it was your daughter who required my presence here, and I am acting in her interests. Young McCarthy must be got off, however.”\n“I am a dying man,” said old Turner. “I have had diabetes for years. My doctor says it is a question whether I shall live a month. Yet I would rather die under my own roof than in a gaol.”\nHolmes rose and sat down at the table with his pen in his hand and a bundle of paper before him. “Just tell us the truth,” he said. “I shall jot down the facts. You will sign it, and Watson here can witness it. Then I could produce your confession at the last extremity to save young McCarthy. I promise you that I shall not use it unless it is absolutely needed.”\n“It’s as well,” said the old man; “it’s a question whether I shall live to the Assizes, so it matters little to me, but I should wish to spare Alice the shock. And now I will make the thing clear to you; it has been a long time in the acting, but will not take me long to tell.\n“You didn’t know this dead man, McCarthy. He was a devil incarnate. I tell you that. God keep you out of the clutches of such a man as he. His grip has been upon me these twenty years, and he has blasted my life. I’ll tell you first how I came to be in his power.\n“It was in the early ’60’s at the diggings. I was a young chap then, hot-blooded and reckless, ready to turn my hand at anything; I got among bad companions, took to drink, had no luck with my claim, took to the bush, and in a word became what you would call over here a highway robber. There were six of us, and we had a wild, free life of it, sticking up a station from time to time, or stopping the wagons on the road to the diggings. Black Jack of Ballarat was the name I went under, and our party is still remembered in the colony as the Ballarat Gang.\n“One day a gold convoy came down from Ballarat to Melbourne, and we lay in wait for it and attacked it. There were six troopers and six of us, so it was a close thing, but we emptied four of their saddles at the first volley. Three of our boys were killed, however, before we got the swag. I put my pistol to the head of the wagon-driver, who was this very man McCarthy. I wish to the Lord that I had shot him then, but I spared him, though I saw his wicked little eyes fixed on my face, as though to remember every feature. We got away with the gold, became wealthy men, and made our way over to England without being suspected. There I parted from my old pals and determined to settle down to a quiet and respectable life. I bought this estate, which chanced to be in the market, and I set myself to do a little good with my money, to make up for the way in which I had earned it. I married, too, and though my wife died young she left me my dear little Alice. Even when she was just a baby her wee hand seemed to lead me down the right path as nothing else had ever done. In a word, I turned over a new leaf and did my best to make up for the past. All was going well when McCarthy laid his grip upon me.\n“I had gone up to town about an investment, and I met him in Regent Street with hardly a coat to his back or a boot to his foot.\n“‘Here we are, Jack,’ says he, touching me on the arm; ‘we’ll be as good as a family to you. There’s two of us, me and my son, and you can have the keeping of us. If you don’t—it’s a fine, law-abiding country is England, and there’s always a policeman within hail.’\n“Well, down they came to the west country, there was no shaking them off, and there they have lived rent free on my best land ever since. There was no rest for me, no peace, no forgetfulness; turn where I would, there was his cunning, grinning face at my elbow. It grew worse as Alice grew up, for he soon saw I was more afraid of her knowing my past than of the police. Whatever he wanted he must have, and whatever it was I gave him without question, land, money, houses, until at last he asked a thing which I could not give. He asked for Alice.\n“His son, you see, had grown up, and so had my girl, and as I was known to be in weak health, it seemed a fine stroke to him that his lad should step into the whole property. But there I was firm. I would not have his cursed stock mixed with mine; not that I had any dislike to the lad, but his blood was in him, and that was enough. I stood firm. McCarthy threatened. I braved him to do his worst. We were to meet at the pool midway between our houses to talk it over.\n“When I went down there I found him talking with his son, so I smoked a cigar and waited behind a tree until he should be alone. But as I listened to his talk all that was black and bitter in me seemed to come uppermost. He was urging his son to marry my daughter with as little regard for what she might think as if she were a slut from off the streets. It drove me mad to think that I and all that I held most dear should be in the power of such a man as this. Could I not snap the bond? I was already a dying and a desperate man. Though clear of mind and fairly strong of limb, I knew that my own fate was sealed. But my memory and my girl! Both could be saved if I could but silence that foul tongue. I did it, Mr. Holmes. I would do it again. Deeply as I have sinned, I have led a life of martyrdom to atone for it. But that my girl should be entangled in the same meshes which held me was more than I could suffer. I struck him down with no more compunction than if he had been some foul and venomous beast. His cry brought back his son; but I had gained the cover of the wood, though I was forced to go back to fetch the cloak which I had dropped in my flight. That is the true story, gentlemen, of all that occurred.”",

I came to the hotel at once. I heard that you had been down to the scene of the tragedy.\"\n\n\"Yes,\" said Holmes; \"I have seen everything which I could see.\"\n\n\"I have been closely questioned by the police, but they seem to have no evidence. I hope that you have formed a definite opinion?\"\n\n\"I have.\"\n\n\"May I ask what it is?\"\n\n\"It is that you are not the murderer.\"\n\nHe started violently, and his face turned ashen grey. A terrible convulsion passed over it, and he clutched the sides of the chair with his bony hands.\n\n\"What do you mean?\" he gasped. \"Who, then, is the murderer?\"\n\n\"I was hoping that you could tell me.\"\n\nHe groaned and sank his face in his hands. \"God help me! God help me!\" he muttered; but I would have confessed had it not been for my girl. If it were not for her, I would have gone to the police and told them everything.\"\n\n\"It was to save her from sorrow that you concealed the truth?\"\n\n\"Yes, yes, it was to save her.\"\n\n\"But you must see that if her son is convicted, or her lover, it will be a far greater blow to her than if you yourself were arrested.\"\n\n\"God knows it would. But I could not bear to see her heart broken.\"\n\n\"You are the last man in the world whom I would wish to injure,\" said Holmes. \"But I must use every means at my disposal to clear this young man, and you know that I will not hesitate to use your confession if it should prove necessary.\"\n\n\"You are right. I will give it to you now. I am a dying man. I have but a month to live. I am dying of diabetes, and I have not the strength to resist you. I will tell you all.\"\n\nHe leaned back in his chair, and began his story in a low, broken voice.\n\n\"It is as well,\" he said. \"You have been very kind to me, Mr. Holmes. I will tell you the truth. I was a wild and reckless youth in Australia, a member of the Ballarat gang. I was known as Black Jack of Ballarat. We attacked a gold convoy, and I held a pistol to the driver’s head. That driver was McCarthy. I spared his life, but he recognized me. We escaped with the gold, and I returned to England, bought my estate, and tried to live a respectable life. I married, and my daughter Alice was born. I thought I had left my past behind me.\n\n\"Years later, McCarthy turned up in London, penniless. He recognized me, and from that day he held my life in his hands. He blackmailed me, forced me to give him land and money, and finally demanded that his son should marry my daughter. I refused. He threatened to expose me. We agreed to meet at Boscombe Pool to discuss it. I arrived early and overheard him urging his son to marry Alice, caring nothing for her feelings. I was mad with rage. I struck him down. His cry brought his son back, but I escaped into the woods. I returned only to retrieve my grey cloak, which I had dropped.\"\n\nHe sank back, exhausted. Holmes took down his statement, promising to use it only if necessary to save James. Turner thanked him, saying he would not live to see the Assizes, and only wished to spare his daughter the shock.",

Holmes had written a note to him that morning, asking him to call at the hotel, and he had come as requested, evidently in the greatest agitation.\n\n\"I received your note, Mr. Holmes,\" he said, in a low, quavering voice. \"I have come. I—I lost no time.\"\n\n\"Thank you,\" said Holmes. \"I wanted to avoid a scene at the police-station. It was as well that you should come here. I have been waiting for you.\"\n\nHe sank into the chair, and I could see that he was suffering from intense internal agitation. A look of despair and hopelessness came over his face, and he passed his hand over his forehead as though to brush away some haunting thought.\n\n\"I know everything, Mr. Turner,\" said Holmes, in a very grave voice. \"I know it all.\"\n\nThe old man started violently, and his face became of a deathly hue. For a moment he sat in silent amazement, then he groaned, and sank his face in his hands. \"God help me! God help me!\" he murmured. \"But I would have confessed had it not been for my dear girl. It would break her heart—it will break her heart when she hears that I am arrested.\"\n\n\"It may not come to that,\" said Holmes.\n\n\"What?\"\n\n\"I am no official agent. I do not represent the police. I am acting in the interests of your daughter. James must be cleared, and I am here to help you.\"\n\n\"God bless you!\" he cried. \"If you could only see how the agony of this business has been killing me! Year by year I have lived in terror, dreading the day when the secret would be discovered. I am a dying man, Mr. Holmes. I have but a short time to live. I am suffering from diabetes, and it has already weakened me terribly. I have not long to go. But before I die I wish to free my mind. My daughter—she is all I have left in the world. She will hear nothing from me. If I can but clear the lad, I care not what becomes of me.\"\n\nHolmes took out a notebook and pencil. \"I will take down your statement,\" said he. \"I will use it if it is necessary to save young McCarthy. If not, it shall never be seen by mortal eye.\"\n\n\"God bless you!\" said the old man. \"I shall have to make a clean breast of it. I am dying, as I said. I may not live to be brought to trial. I would rather die in my own house than in a gaol. But I will tell you the whole truth.\"\n\nHe leaned back in his chair, and began his confession in a low, broken voice.\n\n\"It is a wild story, but it is true.

            "prefix-probing": "Tall, gaunt, and with a haggard face, he wore a long, dark cloak that seemed to envelop his entire frame, giving him an almost spectral appearance as he stepped into the warmly lit sitting-room at Baker Street. His eyes, deep-set and piercing, darted quickly from Holmes to myself, and then back again, as if weighing us both in an instant. His hands, long-fingered and nervous, clutched at the brim of his hat, which he held before him like a shield.\n\nHolmes, who had been lounging in his armchair with that air of languid indifference which he could so well assume, sat up at once, his keen gaze fixed upon our visitor. \"Pray, take a seat, sir,\" he said, indicating the chair opposite. \"You have come to consult me, I perceive.\"\n\nThe man hesitated for a moment, then seated himself, still holding his hat. \"You are Mr. Sherlock Holmes?\" he asked, his voice low and tremulous.\n\n\"I am. This is my friend and colleague, Dr. Watson. You may speak freely before him.\"\n\nThe visitor inclined his head in acknowledgment, but his eyes never left Holmes's face. \"I have heard of your powers, Mr. Holmes,\" he said. \"They are said to be remarkable. I trust that you will be able to assist me in a matter of the utmost delicacy and importance.\"\n\nHolmes steepled his fingers and regarded the man with interest. \"I shall do my best. May I ask your name?\"\n\nThe man hesitated again, then seemed to come to a decision. \"My name is John Openshaw,\" he said. \"But I beg you, do not let that name go beyond these walls.\"\n\n\"You may rely upon our discretion,\" Holmes assured him. \"Now, Mr. Openshaw, I beg you to lay your case before us.\"\n\nOur visitor drew a deep breath, as if to steady himself, and began his tale. \"My story is a strange one, Mr. Holmes, and I fear you may find it difficult to believe. It concerns my family, and a series of events which have brought me to the brink of despair.\"\n\nHe paused, and Holmes nodded encouragingly. \"Pray continue.\"\n\n\"My father, Joseph Openshaw, was the younger brother of my uncle, Elias Openshaw. My uncle spent many years in America, in Florida, where he acquired a considerable fortune. He returned to England some years ago, and took up residence at Horsham, in Sussex. He was a man of peculiar habits, solitary and reserved, and he seldom left his estate.\"\n\n\"I lived with him for a time, after my father's death. He was kind to me, but there was always an air of mystery about him. He kept his affairs to himself, and I soon learned not to question him.\"\n\n\"One morning, about four years ago, my uncle received a letter. It was a plain envelope, with a foreign stamp, and the postmark was from Pondicherry, in India. Inside were five little orange pips, and a single sheet of paper with the letters 'K.K.K.' scrawled upon it.\"\n\nHolmes sat up with sudden interest. \"Five orange pips, you say? And the letters 'K.K.K.'? Most curious. Pray, go on.\"\n\n\"My uncle was greatly agitated by the letter. He locked himself in his room for the rest of the day, and when he emerged, he was a changed man. He burned a number of papers in the fireplace, and from that day forward, he lived in constant fear. He would start at every sound, and he took to carrying a revolver at all times.\"\n\n\"A few weeks later, he was found dead in the garden pond. The coroner returned a verdict of suicide, but I have always believed that he was driven to his death by some unknown terror.\"\n\nHolmes nodded thoughtfully. \"And what became of the estate?\"\n\n\"It passed to my father, who took up residence at Horsham. For a time, all was well. But then, two years ago, my father received a letter, identical to the one my uncle had received. Five orange pips, and the letters 'K.K.K.'\"\n\n\"He, too, was greatly disturbed. He made inquiries, but could learn nothing. A week later, he was found dead, his head dashed against the rocks at the foot of a chalk-pit near the house. Again, the coroner returned a verdict of accidental death, but I am convinced that it was no accident.\"\n\n\"And now, Mr. Holmes, the same fate has befallen me. Three days ago, I received a letter, postmarked from Dundee, with five orange pips enclosed, and the letters 'K.K.K.' written on the paper.\"\n\nHe drew a crumpled envelope from his pocket and handed it to Holmes, who examined it carefully.\n\n\"You have, of course, kept the envelope and its contents?\" Holmes asked.\n\n\"Yes, here they are.\"\n\nHolmes took the envelope and the five shriveled pips, turning them over in his long, slender fingers. \"Most interesting,\" he murmured. \"And what steps have you taken since receiving this warning?\"\n\n\"I have done all I can think of. I have informed the police, but they can make nothing of it. I have searched the house and grounds, but found nothing suspicious. I have even considered leaving England, but I fear that would be of no avail.\"\n\nHolmes was silent for a moment, his brows knitted in thought. \"You have told me all you know?\"\n\n\"Yes, everything.\"\n\n\"And you have no enemies? No one who might wish you harm?\"\n\n\"None that I know of.\"\n\nHolmes rose and paced the room, deep in thought. At last, he turned to our visitor. \"Mr. Openshaw, I believe you are in grave danger. The letters you have received are no idle threats. The 'K.K.K.' is the symbol of a secret society, the Ku Klux Klan, which originated in America after the Civil War. They are known for their acts of vengeance against those who have crossed them.\"\n\nOpenshaw shuddered. \"But what have I done? I have never set foot in America.\"\n\n\"It is not you, but your uncle, who has incurred their wrath. The papers he burned may have contained evidence of their activities. They are relentless in their pursuit of those they consider enemies.\"\n\n\"What am I to do, Mr. Holmes?\"\n\n\"You must act at once. Return home, and place this letter and the pips in a safe place. Write a note stating that you have handed them over to the authorities, and that you are prepared to give evidence if necessary. Post this note to the address given in the letter.\"\n\nOpenshaw nodded, his face pale but resolute. \"I will do as you say.\"\n\n\"And be on your guard. Do not go out alone, and keep your doors and windows securely fastened. I will make further inquiries, and will communicate with you as soon as I have any news.\"\n\nOpenshaw rose and shook Holmes's hand. \"Thank you, Mr. Holmes. I feel better already, knowing that you are on the case.\"\n\nWhen he had gone, Holmes turned to me. \"This is a most singular affair, Watson. The use of the orange pips as a warning, the connection to the Ku Klux Klan, the deaths of both uncle and father—there is a pattern here, if we can but discern it.\"\n\n\"Do you think Openshaw is in real danger?\" I asked.\n\n\"I fear so. The Klan is not known for idle threats. We must act quickly if we are to save him.\"\n\nHolmes spent the rest of the evening poring over maps and directories, making notes and sending telegrams. I could see that his mind was fully engaged with the case, and I did my best to assist him where I could.\n\nThe next morning, we received a telegram from Openshaw. It read: \"Have followed your instructions. All quiet so far. Will keep you informed.\"\n\nHolmes nodded grimly. \"Let us hope that it is not too late.\"\n\nFor the next two days, we heard nothing. Then, on the third morning, the newspaper brought terrible news. John Openshaw had been found dead in the River Thames, his body recovered near Waterloo Bridge. The verdict was accidental death, but Holmes and I knew better.\n\nHolmes was deeply affected by the tragedy. \"I have failed, Watson,\" he said bitterly. \"I should have foreseen this. I should have acted more swiftly.\"\n\n\"You did all you could,\" I said, trying to comfort him.\n\n\"It is not enough. The men who did this must be brought to justice.\"\n\nHolmes redoubled his efforts, tracing the movements of the ship from which the letter had been posted, and eventually identifying the men responsible. He sent a message to the authorities in America, and in time, word came that the perpetrators had met their fate at sea, their ship lost in a storm.\n\nHolmes received the news with grim satisfaction. \"Justice has been done, Watson, though not by my hand. Let us hope that the shadow of the orange pips has been lifted from the Openshaw family forever.\""

Some, too, have baffled his analytical skill, and would be, as narratives, beginnings without an ending, while others have been but partially cleared up, and their explanations were, as far as I could make them, rather unsatisfactory. Still, I have preserved notes of all these cases, and it is my intention at some future date to make them public. In the meantime, I shall restrict myself to those cases in which Holmes himself has furnished me with the materials, and which are likely to afford the reader some new and perhaps unexpected insight into his methods.\n\nFor the present, I will content myself with a single example of his reasoning powers, which may be taken as a fair sample of his work. Among the many cases which he has handled, I have selected that of Mr. Jabez Wilson’s adventure with the Red-Headed League. This case, although in itself trivial, presents those unusual and even grotesque features which are so dear to Holmes, and which have enabled him more than once to demonstrate the value of his singular powers of observation and deduction.\n\nThe facts of the case, as far as I have been able to ascertain them, are these. Mr. Jabez Wilson is a pawnbroker in Coburg Square, near the City. He is a man of a very stout build, with fiery red hair, and a florid face. He came to us one morning in a state of great excitement, with a newspaper in his hand, and with the following extraordinary story, which he had hurriedly written down for our benefit. Holmes was lounging upon the sofa in his dressing-gown, reading the agony column of The Times, and he looked up with a languid interest as our visitor entered."

MAJOR STRUCTURAL ISSUES:\n- The completion invents a scene where Holmes is described as lounging in his dressing-gown, reading a newspaper column, and instructing the narrator to move the lamp. These actions and details are not present in the original passage.\n- The completion omits the original's depiction of Holmes cross-indexing his records of crime at the fireplace, which is a significant activity in the scene.\n\n2. MISSING ELEMENTS:\n- The completion does not include the original's specific description of the narrator reading a particular sea-story, nor does it capture the way the storm outside is described as blending with the text and evoking the sensation of sea waves.\n- The transition from the storm's intensity to the evening's progression is less detailed, missing the escalation of the storm and the specific emotional atmosphere created in the original.\n- The completion omits the detail about the wind's sound in the chimney and the comparison to a child's cry, which adds to the mood in the original.\n- The sequence of the bell ringing, the step in the passage, and the tapping at the door is condensed and partially replaced with invented details about footsteps and a \"sharp and imperative\" knock.\n\n3. INACCURATE ELEMENTS:\n- The completion inaccurately describes Holmes's activities and attire, introducing elements not found in the original (e.g., reading the agony column, wearing a dressing-gown).\n- The sequence of events is altered: the original has Holmes turning the lamp toward the visitor's chair before inviting the person in, while the completion changes the order and adds a gesture for the narrator to move the lamp.\n- The description of the narrator's reading material is inaccurate; the original specifies a particular author and genre, while the completion generalizes it as a \"naval treatise.\"\n- The completion changes the nature of the knock at the door, describing it as \"sharp and imperative,\" which is not present in the original.\n\nTo improve, focus on accurately representing the characters' actions and the sequence of events, avoid inventing new scenes or details, and ensure that the atmospheric and emotional elements from the original are preserved."

I, for my part, had taken up my medical journal, but my attention wandered, drawn by the restless energy that seemed to radiate from my companion.\n\nSuddenly, there came a sharp rap at the door. Mrs. Hudson entered, bearing a card upon a silver tray. Holmes glanced at it, his brows arching in interest.\n\n\"A visitor, Watson,\" he remarked. \"Pray, let us see what the storm has blown to our threshold.\"\n\nThe door opened to admit a tall, cloaked figure, water streaming from his hat and shoulders.

Pray lay your case before us.”\n\nThe young man drew a long breath. “I cannot imagine that you have ever listened to a more extraordinary case.”\n\n“I am all attention,” said Holmes. “Pray give us the essential facts from the commencement, and I can afterwards question you as to those details which seem to me to be most important.”",

He took the seat which my companion had indicated, and, with a slight gesture of apology, drew from his pocket a letter, which he laid upon the table.\n\n\"You will excuse me, I am sure, for troubling you,\" said he, \"but I have had a most singular experience, and, as I have heard that you are the one man in London who can help me, I have come straight to you.\"\n\nHolmes leaned forward and surveyed our visitor with keen interest. \"Pray tell me what has happened to you,\" said he.\n\n\"I have been the recipient of several most mysterious letters, Mr. Holmes. They are unsigned, and the handwriting is disguised. The contents are vague, but they hint at some danger which threatens me if I do not comply with certain conditions. I have no enemies that I know of, and I cannot imagine who could wish me harm.\"\n\nHolmes took up the letter from the table and examined it closely. \"You say you have received several of these?\"\n\n\"Yes, three in all. This is the latest. The others I have left at home, but they are much the same in tone.\"\n\nHolmes turned the letter over in his long, thin fingers, holding it up to the light and scrutinizing the paper and the writing. \"It is certainly curious,\" he remarked. \"The paper is of a common quality, but the ink is of a peculiar bluish tint. The handwriting, as you say, is disguised, but there are certain characteristics which may help us.\"\n\nHe handed the letter to me, and I read it aloud. The message was brief and to the point:\n\n\"If you value your life or your honour, keep away from the Oakley Arms at midnight.\"\n\nThere was no signature, no clue as to the sender. Holmes sat for a few moments in silence, his brows knitted in thought.\n\n\"You have no idea who could have sent this?\" he asked at last.\n\n\"None whatever. I have racked my brains, but I can think of no one who would wish to threaten me in this way.\""

MISSING ELEMENTS:\n- In the final section, the completion leaves out the explicit statement about the boy's attempts to see inside the locked room and the limitation of only being able to see a collection of trunks and bundles, as would be expected in such a room. The original also emphasizes the exclusivity of the prohibition (no one else allowed), which is not fully conveyed.\n\n3. INACCURATE ELEMENTS:\n- The completion inaccurately attributes a reason for the locked room (used as a store-room for papers), which is not provided in the original. This is an invented detail.\n- The description of the boy's access to the house is slightly altered: the original specifies that he could go anywhere and do anything as long as he did not disturb his uncle's privacy, while the completion simplifies this to being able to go anywhere except the locked room, omitting the condition about not disturbing his uncle.\n- The sequence and emphasis of the boy's increasing responsibility and trust in the household are slightly condensed, losing some of the progression present in the original.\n- The completion does not fully capture the original's description of the uncle's reclusiveness and the extent to which he avoided society, including his own brother, though this is a minor structural compression rather than a major omission."

I even examined the fireplace, the waste-paper basket, the very floorboards. But there was no trace of the document.\"\n\nHolmes was silent for a moment, his gaze fixed upon the young man's face.

It was not a common thing for him to receive letters, for his bills were all paid in ready money, and he had no friends of any sort. ‘From India!’ said he as he took it up, ‘Pondicherry postmark! What can this be?’ Opening it hurriedly, out there jumped five little dried orange pips, which pattered down upon his plate. I began to laugh at this, but the laugh was struck from my lips at the sight of his face. His lip had fallen, his eyes were protruding, his skin the colour of putty, and he glared at the envelope which he still held in his trembling hand, ‘K. K. K.!’ he shrieked, and then, ‘My God, my God, my sins have overtaken me!’\n“‘What is it, uncle?’ I cried.\n“‘Death,’ said he, and rising from the table he retired to his room, leaving me palpitating with horror. I took up the envelope and saw scrawled in red ink upon the inner flap, just above the gum, the letter K three times repeated. There was nothing else save the five dried pips. What could be the reason of his overpowering terror? I left the breakfast-table, and as I ascended the stair I met him coming down with an old rusty key, which must have belonged to the attic, in one hand, and a small brass box, like a cashbox, in the other.\n“‘They may do what they like, but I’ll checkmate them still,’ said he with an oath. ‘Tell Mary that I shall want a fire in my room to-day, and send down to Fordham, the Horsham lawyer.’\n“I did as he ordered, and when the lawyer arrived I was asked to step up to the room. The fire was burning brightly, and in the grate there was a mass of black, fluffy ashes, as of burned paper, while the brass box stood open and empty beside it. As I glanced at the box I noticed, with a start, that upon the lid was printed the treble K which I had read in the morning upon the envelope.\n“‘I wish you, John,’ said my uncle, ‘to witness my will. I leave my estate, with all its advantages and all its disadvantages, to my brother, your father, whence it will, no doubt, descend to you. If you can enjoy it in peace, well and good! If you find you cannot, take my advice, my boy, and leave it to your deadliest enemy. I am sorry to give you such a two-edged thing, but I can’t say what turn things are going to take. Kindly sign the paper where Mr. Fordham shows you.’\n“I signed the paper as directed, and the lawyer took it away with him. The singular incident made, as you may think, the deepest impression upon me, and I pondered over it and turned it every way in my mind without being able to make anything of it. Yet I could not shake off the vague feeling of dread which it left behind, though the sensation grew less keen as the weeks passed and nothing happened to disturb the usual routine of our lives. I could see a change in my uncle, however. He drank more than ever, and he was less inclined for any sort of society. Most of his time he would spend in his room, with the door locked upon the inside, but sometimes he would emerge in a sort of drunken frenzy and would burst out of the house and tear about the garden with a revolver in his hand, screaming out that he was afraid of no man, and that he was not to be cooped up, like a sheep in a pen, by man or devil. When these hot fits were over, however, he would rush tumultuously in at the door and lock and bar it behind him, like a man who can brazen it out no longer against the terror which lies at the roots of his soul. At such times I have seen his face, even on a cold day, glisten with moisture, as though it were new raised from a basin.\n“Well, to come to an end of the matter, Mr. Holmes, and not to abuse your patience, there came a night when he made one of those drunken sallies from which he never came back. We found him, when we went to search for him, face downward in a little green-scummed pool, which lay at the foot of the garden. There was no sign of any violence, and the water was but two feet deep, so that the jury, having regard to his known eccentricity, brought in a verdict of ‘suicide.’ But I, who knew how he winced from the very thought of death, had much ado to persuade myself that he had gone out of his way to meet it. The matter passed, however, and my father entered into possession of the estate, and of some £ 14,000, which lay to his credit at the bank.”\n“One moment,” Holmes interposed, “your statement is, I foresee, one of the most remarkable to which I have ever listened. Let me have the date of the reception by your uncle of the letter, and the date of his supposed suicide.”\n“The letter arrived on March 10, 1883. His death was seven weeks later, upon the night of May 2nd.”\n“Thank you. Pray proceed.”",

'And what have I to do with India?' he murmured, and then, opening the envelope, he shook out five little dried orange pips, which fell upon his plate. I began to laugh at this, but the laugh was struck from my lips at the sight of his face. His lip had fallen, his eyes were protruding, his skin the colour of putty, and he glared at the envelope which he still held in his trembling hand. 'K. K. K.!' he shrieked, and then, 'My God, my God, my sins have overtaken me!' 'What is it, uncle?' I cried. 'Death,' said he, and rising from the table he retired to his room, leaving me palpitating with horror. I took up the envelope and saw scrawled in red ink upon the inner flap, just above the gum, the letters K K K repeated three times. There was nothing else save the five dried pips. What could be the reason of his overpowering terror? I left the breakfast-table, and as I ascended the stair I met him coming down with an old rusty key, and a small brass box, which, as I afterwards found, contained a number of papers. 'John,' said he, 'I am going to checkmate them yet. I’ll see that you are right, John. Go to the lawyer’s and ask him to come up at once. Bring him here, and I’ll do what I can for you.' I did as he asked, and when we returned he was sitting at his table with a mass of papers in front of him, and a fire blazing in the grate. The lawyer was a very old man, and he and my uncle talked together for some time. I was sent for to witness the will, which was very short and to the effect that all his property was to be left to my father, with certain legal formalities, and that in case of his death all advantages and disadvantages were to go to him. 'If you cannot enjoy it, give it to your worst enemy,' he said. 'I’ll have nothing more to do with it.' I signed the paper as a witness, and the lawyer took it away with him. The fire was burning fiercely, and the brass box was open and empty beside it. As I glanced at the lid, I saw with a start that the letters K K K were engraved upon it, as upon the envelope. I could not sleep that night for thinking of it, and next day I began to question my uncle. But he would only say, 'Leave it alone, John; it will do no good.' As the days passed, however, he became more and more morose, and would drink heavily, and at times he would be in a state of wild excitement, and would rush about the house with a revolver in his hand, calling out that he was ready for them, and that he would checkmate them yet. Then at other times he would lie in a sort of stupor, and I have seen him, for hours on end, sitting with a bottle of brandy and a revolver in front of him, staring at the fire. On one occasion he went out, and was absent all night. We found him in the morning in the shrubbery, face downwards, with the water of a little pond soaking his clothes. He was quite dead, and there was no sign of violence. The verdict was that he had committed suicide, but I, who knew how he had feared death, and who understood the terror which had come upon him, could not doubt for a moment that he had been hounded to his death by some deep and secret agency. The estate passed at once, by the terms of the will, to my father. He was a very honest man, but a very unimaginative one, and he laughed at what he called the cock-and-bull story of the colonel’s death. 'I have come into eleven thousand pounds,' he said, 'and that is all I have to thank the K K K for.' I asked Holmes if he would like the dates of the letters, and he nodded. 'The first letter,' I said, 'arrived on March 10th, 1883. My uncle died seven weeks later, on the 2nd of May.' Holmes took notes of the dates. 'Thank you. Pray proceed.'",

There were only some ashes left in the grate, and the box was empty. ‘There, John,’ said he, as he turned round, ‘all that I have is yours. If you cannot enjoy it, give it to your worst enemy.

That night I could not sleep for thinking of it, and a vague, undefined dread hung over me for many days. The old man’s behaviour became more and more extraordinary. He would shut himself up in his room with a bottle of brandy and a revolver. He would emerge for a few hours, and then return to his seclusion. He would sometimes, in the middle of the night, rush out into the garden with a revolver in his hand, screaming out that he was ready to face them. But then he would cower in his room, and I have seen him, for hours on end, sitting with a bottle of brandy and a revolver in front of him, staring at the fire. On one occasion he went out, and was absent all night. We found him in the morning in the garden pool, face downward, the water green with scum. There was no sign of violence, and the jury, having regard to his known eccentricity, brought in a verdict of ‘suicide.’ But I, who knew how he had recoiled from death, and who was aware of the secret terror which gnawed at his heart, was utterly at a loss to explain the tragedy. My father inherited the estate, and about £14,000, which lay to his credit at the bank.\n\n“‘One moment,’ Holmes interposed. ‘Your statement is, I foresee, one of the most remarkable to which I have ever listened.

            "prefix-probing": "He had risen early and was already at breakfast when the post arrived. I remember the morning well, for the wind was sharp and the sky overcast, and the fire in the grate was burning cheerily. The colonel, a tall, spare man with a military bearing, took up the letter and examined it with some curiosity. The handwriting was unfamiliar, and the stamp bore the mark of India. He broke the seal and read the contents with a frown gathering on his brow. For a moment he sat motionless, the letter trembling slightly in his hand. Then, with a sudden gesture, he thrust it into the pocket of his dressing-gown and continued his breakfast in silence.\n\nI could see that something had disturbed him, but he made no remark, and I did not venture to question him. After breakfast, he retired to his study, and I heard the key turn in the lock. He remained there for some hours, and when he emerged, his face was pale and set, and there was a look in his eyes which I had never seen before. He went out for a long walk, and when he returned, he seemed to have regained his composure, but he was unusually silent for the rest of the day.\n\nThat evening, as we sat together in the drawing-room, he suddenly turned to me and said, \"I have received a letter from India, Watson. It concerns a matter which I had hoped was long buried. I cannot tell you more at present, but I may have need of your assistance.\"\n\nI assured him of my willingness to help in any way I could, and he thanked me with a grave nod. The subject was not mentioned again, and I retired to bed with a sense of foreboding. The next morning, however, the colonel seemed more himself, and the incident of the letter was, for the time, forgotten.\n\nA week passed without further incident, but on the eighth day, a second letter arrived, bearing the same foreign stamp. This time, the colonel opened it in my presence. As he read, his face grew ashen, and he let out a low exclamation. Without a word, he handed the letter to me. It was brief and to the point:\n\n\"If you value your life, keep your promise. The time is at hand.\"\n\nThere was no signature, but the handwriting was the same as before. I looked at the colonel in alarm. \"What does it mean?\" I asked.\n\nHe shook his head. \"It is a warning, Watson. A warning from the past. I must go to London at once. Will you accompany me?\"\n\nI agreed without hesitation, and we made preparations to leave that very afternoon. The journey was uneventful, and we arrived in London late in the evening. The colonel took lodgings in a quiet street off Baker Street, and I returned to my own rooms.\n\nThe next morning, I called upon Sherlock Holmes and related the events to him. He listened with keen interest, his eyes gleaming with anticipation.\n\n\"This is a most singular case, Watson,\" he said. \"A letter from India, a mysterious warning, and a colonel with a secret. We must see your friend at once.\"\n\nWe found the colonel in his lodgings, pacing the floor with restless energy. Holmes introduced himself, and the colonel greeted him with a mixture of relief and apprehension.\n\n\"Mr. Holmes,\" he said, \"I am in need of your services. I have reason to believe that my life is in danger.\"\n\nHolmes nodded. \"I have heard something of your case from Dr. Watson. May I ask you to tell me the whole story, from the beginning?\"\n\nThe colonel hesitated for a moment, then began his tale. \"I served for many years in India, Mr. Holmes. During my time there, I became involved in a matter which, though I acted with the best of intentions, has haunted me ever since. There was a native uprising, and in the confusion, a great deal of treasure was lost. I was accused, unjustly, of having taken a portion of it for myself. Though I was exonerated by the authorities, there were those who believed me guilty. I received threats, but I thought the matter was at an end when I returned to England.\"\n\n\"And now you have received these letters?\" Holmes asked.\n\n\"Yes. The first was a reminder of the past, the second a direct threat. I do not know who is behind them, but I fear that someone has followed me from India.\"\n\nHolmes considered this for a moment. \"Have you noticed anyone watching you, or any strangers in your vicinity?\"\n\n\"No, but I have been careful. I have not gone out alone, and I have kept my movements secret.\"\n\n\"Very wise,\" Holmes said. \"I would like to examine the letters, if I may.\"\n\nThe colonel handed them over, and Holmes studied them intently. \"The handwriting is distinctive,\" he remarked. \"And the paper is of a kind not commonly found in England. I believe we are dealing with someone who has only recently arrived in this country.\"\n\nHe turned to the colonel. \"You must be on your guard, sir. I will make some inquiries and see what I can discover. In the meantime, do not go out alone, and inform me at once if you receive any further communication.\"\n\nThe colonel thanked Holmes, and we took our leave. As we walked back to Baker Street, Holmes was silent, deep in thought. At last, he spoke. \"This case has all the elements of a classic mystery, Watson. We must be vigilant, for I fear that the danger is very real.\""

For the rest, there was nothing of much importance in the attic save a great many scattered papers and note-books bearing upon my uncle’s life in America. Some of them were of the war time and showed that he had done his duty well and had borne the repute of a brave soldier. Others were of a date during the reconstruction of the Southern states, and were mostly concerned with politics, for he had evidently taken a strong part in opposing the carpet-bag politicians who had been sent down from the North.\n“Well, it was the beginning of ’84 when my father came to live at Horsham, and all went as well as possible with us until the January of ’85. On the fourth day after the new year I heard my father give a sharp cry of surprise as we sat together at the breakfast-table. There he was, sitting with a newly opened envelope in one hand and five dried orange pips in the outstretched palm of the other one. He had always laughed at what he called my cock-and-bull story about the colonel, but he looked very scared and puzzled now that the same thing had come upon himself.\n“‘Why, what on earth does this mean, John?’ he stammered.\n“My heart had turned to lead. ‘It is K. K. K.,’ said I.\n“He looked inside the envelope. ‘So it is,’ he cried. ‘Here are the very letters. But what is this written above them?’\n“‘Put the papers on the sundial,’ I read, peeping over his shoulder.\n“‘What papers? What sundial?’ he asked.\n“‘The sundial in the garden. There is no other,’ said I; ‘but the papers must be those that are destroyed.’\n“‘Pooh!’ said he, gripping hard at his courage. ‘We are in a civilised land here, and we can’t have tomfoolery of this kind. Where does the thing come from?’\n“‘From Dundee,’ I answered, glancing at the postmark.\n“‘Some preposterous practical joke,’ said he. ‘What have I to do with sundials and papers? I shall take no notice of such nonsense.’\n“‘I should certainly speak to the police,’ I said.\n“‘And be laughed at for my pains. Nothing of the sort.’\n“‘Then let me do so?’\n“‘No, I forbid you. I won’t have a fuss made about such nonsense.’\n“It was in vain to argue with him, for he was a very obstinate man. I went about, however, with a heart which was full of forebodings.\n“On the third day after the coming of the letter my father went from home to visit an old friend of his, Major Freebody, who is in command of one of the forts upon Portsdown Hill. I was glad that he should go, for it seemed to me that he was farther from danger when he was away from home. In that, however, I was in error. Upon the second day of his absence I received a telegram from the major, imploring me to come at once. My father had fallen over one of the deep chalk-pits which abound in the neighbourhood, and was lying senseless, with a shattered skull. I hurried to him, but he passed away without having ever recovered his consciousness. He had, as it appears, been returning from Fareham in the twilight, and as the country was unknown to him, and the chalk-pit unfenced, the jury had no hesitation in bringing in a verdict of ‘death from accidental causes.’ Carefully as I examined every fact connected with his death, I was unable to find anything which could suggest the idea of murder. There were no signs of violence, no footmarks, no robbery, no record of strangers having been seen upon the roads. And yet I need not tell you that my mind was far from at ease, and that I was well-nigh certain that some foul plot had been woven round him.\n“In this sinister way I came into my inheritance. You will ask me why I did not dispose of it? I answer, because I was well convinced that our troubles were in some way dependent upon an incident in my uncle’s life, and that the danger would be as pressing in one house as in another.",

Others were of a date during the reconstruction of the Southern States, and were mostly concerned with politics, for he had evidently taken a strong part in opposing the carpet-bag politicians who had been sent down from the North.\n\nWell, it was the beginning of '84 when my father took over the Horsham property, but we lived there as before, and nothing occurred to disturb the usual routine of our lives. In January, '85, a little more than a year after the death of the Colonel, my father received a letter from Dundee. It was addressed in the handwriting of the Colonel, and the envelope contained five little dried orange pips. My father laughed at it at first, but I noticed that after he had examined the writing, and above all after he had read a short message scrawled above the initials K.K.K., he seemed greatly perturbed. The message was: \"Put the papers on the sundial.\" I could not understand what this meant, but my father seemed to know. He became very thoughtful, and for some days he was much preoccupied. He made no allusion to the matter to any of us, but he told me afterwards that he had thought of destroying the papers, but that he had not done so, as he could not bring himself to do it. He said that he had locked them up in the safe, and that he would take care that no harm came to them.\n\nAbout a week after the letter arrived, my father went out to visit an old friend, Major Freebody, who lives near Portsdown Hill. I was glad that he should go, for it seemed to me that he would be safer away from home. In the evening, however, he returned earlier than usual, and I heard him go up to his room. As I was passing his door, I heard him talking loudly to himself. I knocked, but he made no answer, and I found the door locked. I could hear him walking up and down, and I distinctly heard him say, \"What shall I do? What shall I do?\" I tried to enter, but he would not open the door. That night he did not come down to dinner, and the next morning I found that he had been up all night, and that he was very haggard and pale. His manner was altered, and he seemed to be always on the watch. He spoke little, and he would start at the least noise. Such a state of terror was pitiful to see.\n\nWe tried to persuade him to go to the police, but he would not hear of it. \"It is nothing,\" he said, \"nothing at all. I am not frightened, but I will not have my private affairs made public.

I was glad that he should go, for it seemed to me that he would be safer away from home. In the evening, however, he returned earlier than usual, and I heard him go up to his room. As I was passing his door, I heard him talking loudly to himself. I knocked, but he made no answer, and I found the door locked. I could hear him walking up and down, and I distinctly heard him say, \"What shall I do? What shall I do?\" I tried to enter, but he would not open the door. That night he did not come down to dinner, and the next morning I found that he had been up all night, and that he was very haggard and pale.

He made no allusion to the matter to any of us, but he told me afterwards that he had thought of destroying the papers, but that he had not done so, as he could not bring himself to do it.

I suppose it is some poor lunatic. Let us ignore it.\"\n\nHe had always laughed at what he called my cock-and-bull story about the Colonel, but he looked very scared and puzzled all the same. \"What does it mean, John?\" he stammered. \"It means,\" said I, \"that someone knows the secret of the papers, and that you are in danger.\"\n\n\"Nonsense!\" said he. \"What harm can they do me?\"\n\n\"They have done harm to others, father.\"\n\n\"Well, I shall not be frightened out of my wits by a pack of children.\"\n\nIt was in this way that he tried to laugh the matter off, but I could see that he was badly frightened.

            "prefix-probing": "To our surprise, we found the lock rusty and the hinges stiff, as though it had not been opened for many years. The key, which hung on a nail in my father’s study, turned with difficulty, and the door creaked ominously as we pushed it open. The air inside was thick with dust, and the only light came from a small, grimy window at the far end. My father held up his lantern, and together we stepped inside, our footsteps muffled by the thick layer of dust on the floor.\n\nThe attic was filled with old trunks, boxes, and pieces of furniture draped in yellowing sheets. Cobwebs hung from the rafters, and the air was heavy with the scent of age and neglect. We began our search methodically, opening each trunk and box in turn. Most contained nothing but moth-eaten clothes, faded letters, and the detritus of a long-forgotten past. Yet, in the farthest corner, beneath a pile of rotting newspapers, we discovered a small, iron-bound chest.\n\nThe chest was locked, but the key was tied to its handle with a piece of frayed string. My father inserted the key and turned it with a click. The lid creaked open, revealing a collection of papers, a faded photograph, and a small, velvet pouch. The photograph was of a young woman, her features delicate and her eyes hauntingly familiar. The papers were letters, written in a neat, feminine hand, and addressed to my grandfather. As we read through them, a story began to emerge—a story of love, betrayal, and a secret that had been hidden away for decades.\n\nAmong the letters was one that stood out. It was sealed with red wax and marked ‘To be opened only in the event of my death.’ My father hesitated, but at my urging, he broke the seal and unfolded the letter. The contents were shocking. It revealed that my grandfather had been involved in a scandal that had threatened to ruin the family name. The woman in the photograph was not only his lover but also the mother of a child he had never acknowledged. The letter begged for forgiveness and pleaded that the truth be kept secret to protect the family’s reputation.\n\nMy father was deeply shaken by the revelation. He sat in silence for a long time, the letter trembling in his hands. At last, he spoke. ‘We must decide what to do with this knowledge,’ he said. ‘It is a heavy burden, but perhaps it is better that the truth is known, rather than hidden away forever.’\n\nWe spent the rest of the afternoon in the attic, sorting through the remaining contents of the chest. There were more letters, some from the woman to my grandfather, others from him to her. There was also a small locket, containing a lock of hair and a miniature portrait. The evidence was undeniable. My grandfather had led a double life, and the consequences of his actions had been carefully concealed for years.\n\nAs we left the attic, I felt a strange mixture of emotions—shock, sadness, and a sense of relief that the truth had finally come to light. My father locked the attic door behind us, and we returned to the study to discuss what should be done. In the end, we decided to keep the letters and the photograph in a safe place, but to tell the rest of the family what we had discovered. It was not an easy conversation, but it was necessary. The truth, once revealed, brought a sense of closure and understanding that had been missing for so long.\n\nLooking back, I realize that the discovery in the attic changed everything. It altered the way I saw my family, and it gave me a new appreciation for the complexities of human nature. Secrets, no matter how well hidden, have a way of coming to light. And when they do, they can either destroy or heal, depending on how we choose to face them.\n\nThat is the story of what we found in the attic at Horsham. It is a story of love and loss, of secrets and forgiveness. And it is a reminder that the past is never truly gone—it lives on in the memories we keep, and in the truths we are brave enough to uncover."

I had begun to take comfort too soon, however; yesterday morning the blow fell in the very shape in which it had come upon my father.”\nThe young man took from his waistcoat a crumpled envelope, and turning to the table he shook out upon it five little dried orange pips.\n“This is the envelope,” he continued. “The postmark is London—eastern division. Within are the very words which were upon my father’s last message: ‘K. K. K.’; and then ‘Put the papers on the sundial.’”\n“What have you done?” asked Holmes.\n“Nothing.”\n“Nothing?”\n“To tell the truth”—he sank his face into his thin, white hands—“I have felt helpless. I have felt like one of those poor rabbits when the snake is writhing towards it. I seem to be in the grasp of some resistless, inexorable evil, which no foresight and no precautions can guard against.”\n“Tut! tut!” cried Sherlock Holmes. “You must act, man, or you are lost. Nothing but energy can save you. This is no time for despair.”\n“I have seen the police.”\n“Ah!”\n“But they listened to my story with a smile. I am convinced that the inspector has formed the opinion that the letters are all practical jokes, and that the deaths of my relations were really accidents, as the jury stated, and were not to be connected with the warnings.”\nHolmes shook his clenched hands in the air. “Incredible imbecility!” he cried.\n“They have, however, allowed me a policeman, who may remain in the house with me.”\n“Has he come with you to-night?”\n“No. His orders were to stay in the house.”\nAgain Holmes raved in the air.\n“Why did you come to me?” he said, “and, above all, why did you not come at once?”\n“I did not know. It was only to-day that I spoke to Major Prendergast about my troubles and was advised by him to come to you.”\n“It is really two days since you had the letter. We should have acted before this. You have no further evidence, I suppose, than that which you have placed before us—no suggestive detail which might help us?”\n“There is one thing,” said John Openshaw. He rummaged in his coat pocket, and, drawing out a piece of discoloured, blue-tinted paper, he laid it out upon the table. “I have some remembrance,” said he, “that on the day when my uncle burned the papers I observed that the small, unburned margins which lay amid the ashes were of this particular colour. I found this single sheet upon the floor of his room, and I am inclined to think that it may be one of the papers which has, perhaps, fluttered out from among the others, and in that way has escaped destruction. Beyond the mention of pips, I do not see that it helps us much. I think myself that it is a page from some private diary. The writing is undoubtedly my uncle’s.”\nHolmes moved the lamp, and we both bent over the sheet of paper, which showed by its ragged edge that it had indeed been torn from a book. It was headed, “March, 1869,” and beneath were the following enigmatical notices:\n“4th. Hudson came. Same old platform.\n“7th.

MAJOR STRUCTURAL ISSUES:\n- The completion invents a breakfast scene and the presence of a maid delivering the letter, which are not present in the original. This adds unnecessary narrative detail and alters the sequence of events.\n- The completion omits the initial action of the young man taking the envelope from his waistcoat and shaking out the orange pips onto the table, which is a key visual moment early in the passage.\n- The completion introduces a dialogue with Watson about the postmark and the possibility of the letter being sent from the house, which does not occur in the original passage.\n\n2. MISSING ELEMENTS:\n- The completion does not include the specific mention of the elapsed time since the father’s death and the period of happiness at Horsham, which sets the context for the current events.\n- The completion omits the detail that the envelope contains the same words as the father’s last message, which is important for establishing the threat’s continuity.\n- The completion leaves out Holmes’s repeated urging for immediate action and his frustration at the delay, which is a key part of the middle section.\n- The completion does not include the detail about the policeman being assigned to stay in the house and the question of whether he accompanied the young man that night.\n- The completion misses the specific process of John Openshaw rummaging in his coat pocket for the blue-tinted paper and the observation about the unburned margins among the ashes.\n- The completion omits the description of Holmes moving the lamp and both characters bending over the sheet, which provides atmosphere and focus on the evidence.\n\n3. INACCURATE ELEMENTS:\n- The completion inaccurately describes the envelope as coarse and heavy, and adds details about the handwriting and red ink that are not present in the original.\n- The sequence of events is altered: the breakfast scene and the maid’s delivery of the letter are inventions, and the order of presenting the envelope and pips is changed.\n- The completion attributes a wry smile and a sheep/wolves metaphor to the young man, which are not present in the original; the original uses a different animal metaphor and emotional description.\n- The completion has Holmes ask for the envelope later than in the original, and the details about the envelope’s appearance and postmark are inaccurate.\n- The completion has John Openshaw claim to have told Holmes everything before producing the blue-tinted paper, whereas in the original, he specifically remembers and produces it as an afterthought.\n- The completion’s description of the blue-tinted paper and its discovery is less precise and omits the connection to the unburned margins and the possibility of it fluttering out from the others.\n- The completion’s presentation of the diary entries is mostly accurate, but the lead-in and context are less detailed than in the original."

            "prefix-probing": "I was at that time twenty-three years of age, and had been living with my father at our little place in Stoke Moran. We were a family of some wealth and position, and my father, who had been a soldier in India, retired with a comfortable fortune. My mother died when I was but two years old, and my only companion was my twin sister, Julia. We were twins, and so close in age and affection that we were rarely apart. Our stepfather, Dr. Grimesby Roylott, was a man of violent temper and eccentric habits, but he had always treated us with a certain rough kindness, and we had no reason to fear him until after our father’s death.\n\nAfter that, however, his temper became more and more violent, and he seemed to take a particular dislike to Julia and myself. He shut us up in the house, forbade us to see our friends, and kept a close watch upon all our movements. It was a lonely and unhappy life, and we often spoke of leaving him and setting up a home of our own. But we had no money of our own, and he held the purse-strings tightly.\n\nIt was about two years ago that the first strange incident occurred. Julia had become engaged to be married to a young man of good family, and the wedding was to take place in the spring. One night, about a fortnight before the wedding, she came to my room, pale and trembling, and told me that she had heard a low, whistling sound in the dead of night. She could not tell where it came from, but it seemed to be just outside her window. I tried to reassure her, but she was so agitated that I could not help feeling uneasy myself.\n\nThe next night, the same thing happened again. Julia heard the whistling sound, and this time she was so frightened that she locked her door and sat up all night. In the morning, she was pale and haggard, and begged me to let her sleep in my room for the rest of the week. I agreed, and for several nights nothing happened. But on the night before her wedding, she went back to her own room, saying that she did not wish to disturb me. That was the last time I saw her alive.\n\nIn the middle of the night, I was awakened by a terrible scream. I rushed to Julia’s room and found her standing in the doorway, her face white with terror. She tried to speak, but only managed to gasp out, “The speckled band!” before she fell to the floor and died in my arms. The doctors could find no cause for her death, and the coroner’s jury returned a verdict of death by misadventure. But I have never believed that my sister died a natural death, and I have always suspected that my stepfather had something to do with it.\n\nSince then, I have lived in constant fear for my own life. Dr. Roylott’s temper has grown worse, and he has become more and more violent. I have heard the whistling sound myself on several occasions, and I am convinced that it is connected with my sister’s death. That is why I have come to you, Mr. Holmes. I am afraid, and I do not know what to do.”\n\nSherlock Holmes listened attentively to the young woman’s story, his keen eyes fixed upon her face. “You have done wisely in coming to me, Miss Stoner,” he said. “If we can only unravel this mystery before it is too late, we may be able to save your life as well as to avenge your sister’s death.”"

You must put this piece of paper which you have shown us into the brass box which you have described. You must also put in a note to say that all the other papers were burned by your uncle, and that this is the only one which you have preserved. You must assert that in such words as will carry conviction with them. Having done this, you must at once put the box out upon the sundial, as directed. Do you understand?”\n\n“Entirely.”\n\n“Do not think of revenge, or anything of the sort, at present. I think that we may gain that by means of the law; but we have our web to weave, while theirs is already woven. The first consideration is to remove the pressing danger which threatens you. The second is to clear up the mystery, and to punish the guilty parties.”\n\n“I thank you,” said the young man, rising, and pulling on his overcoat. “You have given me fresh life and hope.

I was to sit in that little back room from ten to two, with the exception of Saturday, and to copy out the Encyclopaedia Britannica. That was my duty, Mr. Holmes.”\n\n“Entirely so.

Then he lit his pipe, and leaning back in his chair he watched the blue smoke-rings as they chased each other up to the ceiling.\n“I think, Watson,” he remarked at last, “that of all our cases we have had none more fantastic than this.”\n“Save, perhaps, the Sign of Four.”\n“Well, yes. Save, perhaps, that. And yet this John Openshaw seems to me to be walking amid even greater perils than did the Sholtos.”\n“But have you,” I asked, “formed any definite conception as to what these perils are?”\n“There can be no question as to their nature,” he answered.\n“Then what are they? Who is this K. K. K., and why does he pursue this unhappy family?”\nSherlock Holmes closed his eyes and placed his elbows upon the arms of his chair, with his finger-tips together. “The ideal reasoner,” he remarked, “would, when he had once been shown a single fact in all its bearings, deduce from it not only all the chain of events which led up to it but also all the results which would follow from it. As Cuvier could correctly describe a whole animal by the contemplation of a single bone, so the observer who has thoroughly understood one link in a series of incidents should be able to accurately state all the other ones, both before and after. We have not yet grasped the results which the reason alone can attain to. Problems may be solved in the study which have baffled all those who have sought a solution by the aid of their senses. To carry the art, however, to its highest pitch, it is necessary that the reasoner should be able to utilise all the facts which have come to his knowledge; and this in itself implies, as you will readily see, a possession of all knowledge, which, even in these days of free education and encyclopædias, is a somewhat rare accomplishment. It is not so impossible, however, that a man should possess all knowledge which is likely to be useful to him in his work, and this I have endeavoured in my case to do. If I remember rightly, you on one occasion, in the early days of our friendship, defined my limits in a very precise fashion.”\n“Yes,” I answered, laughing. “It was a singular document. Philosophy, astronomy, and politics were marked at zero, I remember. Botany variable, geology profound as regards the mud-stains from any region within fifty miles of town, chemistry eccentric, anatomy unsystematic, sensational literature and crime records unique, violin-player, boxer, swordsman, lawyer, and self-poisoner by cocaine and tobacco. Those, I think, were the main points of my analysis.”\nHolmes grinned at the last item. “Well,” he said, “I say now, as I said then, that a man should keep his little brain-attic stocked with all the furniture that he is likely to use, and the rest he can put away in the lumber-room of his library, where he can get it if he wants it. Now, for such a case as the one which has been submitted to us to-night, we need certainly to muster all our resources. Kindly hand me down the letter K of the American Encyclopædia which stands upon the shelf beside you. Thank you. Now let us consider the situation and see what may be deduced from it. In the first place, we may start with a strong presumption that Colonel Openshaw had some very strong reason for leaving America. Men at his time of life do not change all their habits and exchange willingly the charming climate of Florida for the lonely life of an English provincial town. His extreme love of solitude in England suggests the idea that he was in fear of someone or something, so we may assume as a working hypothesis that it was fear of someone or something which drove him from America. As to what it was he feared, we can only deduce that by considering the formidable letters which were received by himself and his successors. Did you remark the postmarks of those letters?”\n“The first was from Pondicherry, the second from Dundee, and the third from London.”\n“From East London. What do you deduce from that?”\n“They are all seaports. That the writer was on board of a ship.”\n“Excellent. We have already a clue. There can be no doubt that the probability—the strong probability—is that the writer was on board of a ship. And now let us consider another point. In the case of Pondicherry, seven weeks elapsed between the threat and its fulfilment, in Dundee it was only some three or four days. Does that suggest anything?”\n“A greater distance to travel.”\n“But the letter had also a greater distance to come.”\n“Then I do not see the point.”\n“There is at least a presumption that the vessel in which the man or men are is a sailing-ship. It looks as if they always send their singular warning or token before them when starting upon their mission. You see how quickly the deed followed the sign when it came from Dundee. If they had come from Pondicherry in a steamer they would have arrived almost as soon as their letter. But, as a matter of fact, seven weeks elapsed. I think that those seven weeks represented the difference between the mail-boat which brought the letter and the sailing vessel which brought the writer.”\n“It is possible.”\n“More than that. It is probable. And now you see the deadly urgency of this new case, and why I urged young Openshaw to caution. The blow has always fallen at the end of the time which it would take the senders to travel the distance. But this one comes from London, and therefore we cannot count upon delay.”\n“Good God!” I cried. “What can it mean, this relentless persecution?”\n“The papers which Openshaw carried are obviously of vital importance to the person or persons in the sailing-ship. I think that it is quite clear that there must be more than one of them. A single man could not have carried out two deaths in such a way as to deceive a coroner’s jury. There must have been several in it, and they must have been men of resource and determination. Their papers they mean to have, be the holder of them who it may. In this way you see K. K. K. ceases to be the initials of an individual and becomes the badge of a society.”\n“But of what society?”\n“Have you never—” said Sherlock Holmes, bending forward and sinking his voice—“have you never heard of the Ku Klux Klan?”",

The flickering light of the fire played upon his keen, eager face, throwing into sharp relief the aquiline features and the piercing eyes which had become so familiar to me during our long association. For a few moments, he remained thus, lost in thought, while I, seated opposite him, watched in silence, unwilling to disturb the current of his reflections.\n\nAt length, Holmes spoke, his voice low and measured, yet carrying a note of suppressed excitement. \"Watson,\" he said, \"have you ever considered how curious it is that the most commonplace events may, upon closer inspection, reveal the most singular mysteries?\"\n\nI smiled, accustomed as I was to Holmes's habit of extracting profound meaning from the trivial. \"You have often demonstrated as much to me, Holmes,\" I replied. \"Is there some particular event which has set your mind to work this evening?\"\n\nHe nodded, his eyes never leaving the fire. \"Indeed, there is. You recall, perhaps, the letter which arrived this morning? The one bearing the curious seal?\"\n\nI cast my mind back to the morning's post. \"Yes, I remember it well. You seemed much interested in it.\"\n\nHolmes reached to the table beside him and picked up a folded sheet of paper. He handed it to me without a word. I unfolded it and read as follows:\n\n'221B Baker Street,\nLondon.\n\nDear Mr. Holmes,\n\nI am in the most desperate need of your assistance. A matter of the utmost delicacy and importance has arisen, and I can think of no one but yourself to whom I might turn. I beg you to grant me an interview at your earliest convenience. I shall call upon you at half-past seven this evening.\n\nYours faithfully,\nViolet Hunter.'\n\nI looked up from the letter. \"A lady in distress, Holmes?\"\n\nHe smiled faintly. \"So it would appear. The handwriting is firm and clear, betraying a certain strength of character. Yet the tone of the letter suggests anxiety, perhaps even fear.\"\n\n\"And the seal?\" I inquired.\n\n\"Ah, the seal is most interesting. It is not the crest of any noble family with which I am acquainted, nor does it bear the mark of any institution. It is, rather, a simple device—a sprig of heather, pressed in wax.\"\n\nI pondered this for a moment. \"Does it signify anything to you?\"\n\nHolmes shook his head. \"Not as yet. But I have no doubt that Miss Hunter will enlighten us when she arrives.\"\n\nAs if in answer to his words, there came a sharp rap at the door. Mrs. Hudson entered, bearing a card upon a salver. Holmes took it and glanced at the name.\n\n\"Show the lady in, Mrs. Hudson.\"\n\nA moment later, a young woman entered the room. She was plainly dressed, but there was an air of quiet dignity about her which commanded respect. Her face was pale, and her eyes betrayed a nervous apprehension.\n\nHolmes rose and bowed. \"Miss Violet Hunter, I presume? Pray, be seated. This is my friend and colleague, Dr. Watson.\"\n\nShe acknowledged the introduction with a slight inclination of her head, then turned to Holmes. \"Mr. Holmes, I thank you for seeing me at such short notice.\"\n\n\"It is my pleasure, Miss Hunter. You mentioned in your letter that you are in need of assistance. Will you be so good as to tell us the nature of your difficulty?\"\n\nShe hesitated for a moment, as if collecting her thoughts. \"I am—or rather, I was—governess to the children of Colonel Spence Munro, of Casterbridge. But the family has recently gone abroad, and I found myself in need of a new position.\"\n\nHolmes nodded encouragingly. \"Pray, continue.\"\n\n\"I answered an advertisement in the Morning Chronicle, seeking a governess for a single child. The terms offered were most generous—far more so than is usual for such a post. I was to receive one hundred pounds a year, with all found.\"\n\nI could not help but exclaim, \"That is indeed a handsome salary!\"\n\nMiss Hunter smiled faintly. \"So I thought, Dr. Watson. I applied for the position and was summoned to an interview at the offices of Mr. Rucastle, of Copper Beeches, near Winchester.\"\n\nHolmes leaned forward, his interest evidently aroused. \"And what manner of man is this Mr. Rucastle?\"\n\n\"He is a stout, florid man, with a hearty manner and a loud laugh. He seemed most amiable, and his wife, though reserved, was polite. There was also a child, a boy of about six, who appeared healthy and well cared for.\"\n\n\"And yet you are uneasy?\"\n\nMiss Hunter hesitated. \"It was not so much the family as the conditions attached to the post which troubled me. Mr. Rucastle made certain peculiar requests. For example, he asked if I would be willing to cut my hair short.\"\n\nI could not suppress a start of surprise. \"To cut your hair? But why?\"\n\n\"He gave no reason, save that his wife had taken a fancy to short hair, and that the last governess had worn hers so. I was reluctant, but the salary was so generous that I agreed.\"\n\nHolmes's eyes gleamed. \"Were there any other unusual conditions?\"\n\n\"Yes. I was told that I must wear a particular dress each evening, and sit in a certain chair by the window, with the lamp beside me. I was not to move or speak, but simply to sit there for an hour.\"\n\nHolmes exchanged a glance with me. \"Most singular! And did you comply?\"\n\n\"I did, Mr. Holmes. But after a few days, I became increasingly uneasy. There were locked doors, whispered conversations, and a sense of something concealed. I began to fear that I was being used for some purpose of which I was unaware.\"\n\nHolmes nodded gravely. \"You were wise to seek advice. Tell me, Miss Hunter, did you observe anything else of note?\"\n\nShe hesitated. \"Once, I caught a glimpse of a face at an upper window—a pale, frightened face, which vanished as soon as I looked up. I am convinced that there is some secret at Copper Beeches, and I fear for my safety.\"\n\nHolmes rose and paced the room, his hands clasped behind his back. \"Your story is most intriguing, Miss Hunter. I believe that you have indeed stumbled upon a mystery. Watson, what do you make of it?\"\n\nI shook my head. \"It is most perplexing. The conditions are so unusual as to suggest some hidden motive.\"\n\nHolmes turned to Miss Hunter. \"Would you be willing to return to Copper Beeches, if I were to accompany you?\"\n\nShe hesitated, then nodded. \"If you think it safe, Mr. Holmes.\"\n\n\"I believe that with proper precautions, we may uncover the truth. Watson, will you join us?\"\n\n\"Of course, Holmes.\"\n\nHolmes smiled. \"Then it is settled. Miss Hunter, you have shown great courage. Rest assured that we shall do all in our power to assist you.\"\n\nShe rose and thanked us, her face showing a glimmer of hope. As she departed, Holmes turned to me, his eyes alight with anticipation.\n\n\"Come, Watson,\" he said. \"The game is afoot!\""

A name derived from the fanciful resemblance to the sound produced by cocking a rifle. This terrible secret society was formed by some ex-Confederate soldiers in the Southern states after the Civil War, and it rapidly formed local branches in different parts of the country, notably in Tennessee, Louisiana, the Carolinas, Georgia, and Florida. Its power was used for political purposes, principally for the terrorising of the negro voters and the murdering and driving from the country of those who were opposed to its views. Its outrages were usually preceded by a warning sent to the marked man in some fantastic but generally recognised shape—a sprig of oak-leaves in some parts, melon seeds or orange pips in others. On receiving this the victim might either openly abjure his former ways, or might fly from the country. If he braved the matter out, death would unfailingly come upon him, and usually in some strange and unforeseen manner. So perfect was the organisation of the society, and so systematic its methods, that there is hardly a case upon record where any man succeeded in braving it with impunity, or in which any of its outrages were traced home to the perpetrators. For some years the organisation flourished in spite of the efforts of the United States government and of the better classes of the community in the South. Eventually, in the year 1869, the movement rather suddenly collapsed, although there have been sporadic outbreaks of the same sort since that date.’\n“You will observe,” said Holmes, laying down the volume, “that the sudden breaking up of the society was coincident with the disappearance of Openshaw from America with their papers. It may well have been cause and effect. It is no wonder that he and his family have some of the more implacable spirits upon their track. You can understand that this register and diary may implicate some of the first men in the South, and that there may be many who will not sleep easy at night until it is recovered.”\n“Then the page we have seen—”\n“Is such as we might expect. It ran, if I remember right, ‘sent the pips to A, B, and C’—that is, sent the society’s warning to them. Then there are successive entries that A and B cleared, or left the country, and finally that C was visited, with, I fear, a sinister result for C. Well, I think, Doctor, that we may let some light into this dark place, and I believe that the only chance young Openshaw has in the meantime is to do what I have told him. There is nothing more to be said or to be done to-night, so hand me over my violin and let us try to forget for half an hour the miserable weather and the still more miserable ways of our fellow men.”",

The morning was bright, and the air was filled with the clatter of horses’ hooves and the rumble of wheels. Holmes stood for a moment in silence, his keen eyes following the movements of the passers-by, before he turned back to me.\n\n“You see, Watson,” he said, “the world is full of obvious things which nobody by any chance ever observes. But to the trained reasoner, every fact is valuable. The little things are infinitely the most important.”\n\nI nodded, recalling the many occasions on which Holmes had deduced the most remarkable conclusions from the smallest of clues. It was this very faculty which had drawn me to him from the first, and which had made our adventures together so memorable.\n\nAt that moment, there was a sharp rap at the door, and Mrs. Hudson entered, bearing a card upon a silver tray. Holmes took it up and glanced at it.\n\n“Ah, Watson, we are to have a visitor. Pray compose yourself. This promises to be interesting.”\n\nHe handed me the card. It bore the name of Miss Mary Sutherland.\n\n“Show the lady in, Mrs. Hudson,” said Holmes.\n\nA moment later, our client entered. She was a large woman, with a heavy step and a resolute expression. Her eyes, however, betrayed a certain nervousness, and she glanced about the room as though uncertain of her reception.\n\n“Pray take a seat, Miss Sutherland,” said Holmes, with that mixture of courtesy and briskness which always put his clients at their ease. “This is my friend and colleague, Dr. Watson. You may speak freely before him.”\n\nMiss Sutherland seated herself, and after a moment’s hesitation, began her story. As she spoke, Holmes leaned back in his chair, his long, thin fingers pressed together, his eyes half closed. I could see that he was following every word with the closest attention.\n\n“My father died some years ago, Mr. Holmes,” she began, “and I live with my mother and my stepfather, Mr. James Windibank. My stepfather is a very reserved man, and he is often away from home on business. It was at one of these times, when he was in France, that I met Mr. Hosmer Angel.”\n\nShe paused, and a faint flush came to her cheeks. Holmes nodded encouragingly.\n\n“I met Mr. Angel at a gasfitters’ ball. He was a quiet, gentlemanly man, and he seemed to take a great interest in me. We saw each other several times, always when my stepfather was away. He was very particular that our meetings should be kept secret, and he would never come to the house when my stepfather was at home.”\n\nShe hesitated again, and Holmes leaned forward.\n\n“Pray continue, Miss Sutherland. I assure you, your confidence is not misplaced.”\n\nShe drew a deep breath. “We became engaged, Mr. Holmes. But on the very morning of our wedding, as we were on our way to the church, Mr. Angel disappeared. I have not seen or heard from him since.”\n\nHolmes’s eyes gleamed with interest. “A most singular case,” he murmured. “Pray, give me all the details.”"

How was it done?” He spoke calmly, but I could see that he was deeply moved.\n“My eye caught the name of Openshaw, and the heading ‘Tragedy Near Waterloo Bridge.’ Here is the account:\n“‘Between nine and ten last night Police-Constable Cook, of the H Division, on duty near Waterloo Bridge, heard a cry for help and a splash in the water. The night, however, was extremely dark and stormy, so that, in spite of the help of several passers-by, it was quite impossible to effect a rescue. The alarm, however, was given, and, by the aid of the water-police, the body was eventually recovered. It proved to be that of a young gentleman whose name, as it appears from an envelope which was found in his pocket, was John Openshaw, and whose residence is near Horsham. It is conjectured that he may have been hurrying down to catch the last train from Waterloo Station, and that in his haste and the extreme darkness he missed his path and walked over the edge of one of the small landing-places for river steamboats. The body exhibited no traces of violence, and there can be no doubt that the deceased had been the victim of an unfortunate accident, which should have the effect of calling the attention of the authorities to the condition of the riverside landing-stages.’”\nWe sat in silence for some minutes, Holmes more depressed and shaken than I had ever seen him.\n“That hurts my pride, Watson,” he said at last. “It is a petty feeling, no doubt, but it hurts my pride. It becomes a personal matter with me now, and, if God sends me health, I shall set my hand upon this gang. That he should come to me for help, and that I should send him away to his death—!” He sprang from his chair and paced about the room in uncontrollable agitation, with a flush upon his sallow cheeks and a nervous clasping and unclasping of his long thin hands.\n“They must be cunning devils,” he exclaimed at last. “How could they have decoyed him down there? The Embankment is not on the direct line to the station. The bridge, no doubt, was too crowded, even on such a night, for their purpose. Well, Watson, we shall see who will win in the long run.

            "prefix-probing": "Holmes was already at breakfast when I entered the room, his keen eyes glancing up from the morning paper as I took my seat opposite him. The familiar clutter of our sitting-room at Baker Street was illuminated by the gentle sunlight, which picked out the motes of dust in the air and cast a golden hue upon the worn armchairs and the scattered paraphernalia of Holmes’s many pursuits. The air was tinged with the faint aroma of coffee and the more pungent scent of tobacco, for Holmes had already lit his pipe and was drawing upon it thoughtfully.\n\n“Good morning, Watson,” he said, folding the paper and setting it aside. “You observe the weather has taken a turn for the better. I daresay it will bring out the crowds in Hyde Park.”\n\nI nodded, helping myself to a cup of coffee. “It is a welcome change after the dreariness of the past week. I trust you have not been idle?”\n\nHolmes smiled, a glint of amusement in his eyes. “On the contrary, I have been most industrious. I have already received two clients this morning, and I expect a third before noon. The city never sleeps, and neither, it seems, do its mysteries.”\n\nAs he spoke, there came a sharp rap at the door, and Mrs. Hudson entered, bearing a card upon a silver tray. Holmes took it, glanced at the inscription, and handed it to me. It read:\n\nMr. Jabez Wilson\n\n“Show the gentleman up, Mrs. Hudson,” Holmes said. A moment later, our visitor entered—a stout, florid-faced man with fiery red hair and a look of perplexity upon his features. He bowed awkwardly and took the seat Holmes indicated.\n\n“I have come to you, Mr. Holmes, because I have been sorely puzzled by a most singular affair,” he began, his voice betraying both anxiety and hope. “I have heard of your powers, sir, and I trust you may be able to shed some light upon my difficulty.”\n\nHolmes steepled his fingers and regarded our visitor with that air of quiet concentration which I had come to know so well. “Pray, proceed, Mr. Wilson. I am at your service.”\n\nThus began the curious case of the Red-Headed League, one of the most remarkable adventures in which I had the privilege to assist my friend. As Mr. Wilson recounted the strange events that had befallen him—the mysterious advertisement, the peculiar employment, and the sudden dissolution of the League—Holmes listened intently, interjecting only the occasional question to clarify some point of detail.\n\nWhen at last Mr. Wilson had finished his narrative, Holmes leaned back in his chair, his eyes half-closed and his fingers drumming upon the armrest. “A most singular business, indeed,” he murmured. “Watson, what do you make of it?”\n\nI confessed that I was as much at a loss as our client, for the affair seemed to me to be utterly inexplicable. Holmes, however, appeared to be in high spirits, and I could see that his mind was already at work, piecing together the fragments of the puzzle.\n\n“Mr. Wilson,” he said at length, “I believe I may be able to assist you. But first, I must ask you a few more questions.”\n\nAnd so, as the morning sunlight streamed through the window, illuminating the dust motes and casting long shadows across the room, we set about unraveling the mystery that had brought Mr. Jabez Wilson to our door."

He will find it as sure a precursor of his fate as Openshaw did before him.”\n“And who is this Captain Calhoun?”\n“The leader of the gang. I shall have the others, but he first.”\n“How did you trace it, then?”\nHe took a large sheet of paper from his pocket, all covered with dates and names.\n“I have spent the whole day,” said he, “over Lloyd’s registers and files of the old papers, following the future career of every vessel which touched at Pondicherry in January and February in ’83. There were thirty-six ships of fair tonnage which were reported there during those months. Of these, one, the Lone Star, instantly attracted my attention, since, although it was reported as having cleared from London, the name is that which is given to one of the states of the Union.”\n“Texas, I think.”\n“I was not and am not sure which; but I knew that the ship must have an American origin.”\n“What then?”\n“I searched the Dundee records, and when I found that the barque Lone Star was there in January, ’85, my suspicion became a certainty. I then inquired as to the vessels which lay at present in the port of London.”\n“Yes?”\n“The Lone Star had arrived here last week. I went down to the Albert Dock and found that she had been taken down the river by the early tide this morning, homeward bound to Savannah. I wired to Gravesend and learned that she had passed some time ago, and as the wind is easterly I have no doubt that she is now past the Goodwins and not very far from the Isle of Wight.”\n“What will you do, then?”\n“Oh, I have my hand upon him. He and the two mates, are as I learn, the only native-born Americans in the ship. The others are Finns and Germans. I know, also, that they were all three away from the ship last night. I had it from the stevedore who has been loading their cargo. By the time that their sailing-ship reaches Savannah the mail-boat will have carried this letter, and the cable will have informed the police of Savannah that these three gentlemen are badly wanted here upon a charge of murder.”",

It had escaped my memory. I have had nothing since breakfast.”\n\n“Nothing?”\n\n“Not a bite. I had no time to think of it.”\n\n“And the success?” I asked.\n\nHolmes smiled, and drew a large sheet of paper from his pocket, covered with dates and names. “It is all here,” he said. “I have them in the hollow of my hand. Young Openshaw shall not long remain unavenged.”\n\nHe took an orange from the cupboard, and tearing it open, squeezed out the five pips upon the table. He placed them in an envelope. On the inside of the flap he wrote, “S. H. for J. O.” Then he sealed it, addressed it to “Captain James Calhoun, Barque ‘Lone Star,’ Savannah, Georgia,” and laid it upon the table.\n\n“That will await him when he enters port,” said he. “It will give him something to think about. I have put their own devilish trade-mark upon them, and I can afford to sit back and await the result.”\n\n“How did you trace it, then?” I asked.\n\nHe sat down and unfolded the paper. “I spent the day at Lloyd’s. By examining the list of ships which were in Pondicherry in January and February, 1883, and in Dundee in January, 1885, I found that only the ‘Lone Star’ was present at both times.”\n\n“And the name?”\n\n“The name suggested an American origin. I was not sure which state, but the ‘Lone Star’ is the emblem of Texas.”\n\n“I see.”\n\n“She had cleared from London last week, bound for Savannah. I went down to the Albert Dock and found she had already sailed that morning. A wire to Gravesend showed that she had passed some time ago, and with this easterly wind she is now past the Goodwins and not far from the Isle of Wight.”\n\n“What will you do?”\n\n“I have already done it. The three men—Calhoun and his two mates—are the only Americans on board; the rest are Finns and Germans. I learned from the stevedore that they were all ashore last night. By the time the ‘Lone Star’ reaches Savannah, the mail-boat will have carried this letter, and a cable will have informed the police that the three men are wanted in London for murder.”\n\n---\n\n**End of Segment**",
                "refinement_prompt": "IMPROVEMENT GUIDANCE:\n1. MAJOR STRUCTURAL ISSUES:\n- The completion omits a significant portion of the original dialogue, particularly the back-and-forth questioning between the two characters about Holmes's progress and the details of his investigation. Some of the original's stepwise revelations and clarifications are compressed or skipped.\n- The completion introduces a reflective moment where Holmes stretches out in his chair and makes a general statement about his day, which is not present in the original passage.\n\n2. MISSING ELEMENTS:\n- Early in the passage, the completion does not include the full sequence of dialogue that clarifies Holmes's lack of food and the reason for it, as well as the repeated questioning about whether he has eaten.\n- The step-by-step recounting of Holmes's investigative process is condensed. The original includes a detailed enumeration of the ships, the specific months, and the process of elimination, which is only briefly summarized in the completion.\n- The completion omits the explicit mention of Holmes taking out a large sheet of paper covered with dates and names, which is a key visual and procedural detail in the original.\n- The original contains a more detailed exchange about the American origin of the ship's name and Watson's uncertainty about which state is referenced, which is missing in the completion.\n- The completion does not include the explicit question and answer format regarding Holmes's tracing of the ship and the sequence of his investigation.\n\n3. INACCURATE ELEMENTS:\n- The completion inaccurately presents the sequence of Holmes's actions and explanations, sometimes combining or rearranging events (such as the preparation of the envelope and the explanation of the investigation).\n- There is an invented reflection by Holmes about not leaving a clue behind, which is not present in the original.\n- The completion attributes certain lines and actions to Holmes that are not in the original, such as the statement about being able to \"afford to laugh at them now.\"\n- The completion omits or alters the order of Holmes's investigative steps, such as the process of checking Lloyd's registers, examining the ships, and confirming the Lone Star's movements, which in the original are presented in a specific, logical sequence.\n- The completion does not accurately represent the final explanation about the composition of the ship's crew and the information obtained from the stevedore, which in the original is more detailed and precise."

            "prefix-probing": "As I entered our familiar sitting-room, I found Holmes lounging upon the sofa, his long, thin form stretched out in characteristic indolence. The lamp upon the table cast a mellow glow over the scattered papers and chemical apparatus that littered the room. Holmes glanced up as I entered, his keen eyes bright with anticipation.\n\n\"Ah, Watson, you have returned at last,\" he remarked, waving me to my usual chair. \"I trust your day has been productive?\"\n\n\"As much as can be expected,\" I replied, settling into my seat. \"But I confess, Holmes, my mind has been occupied with the curious case you mentioned this morning. Have you made any progress?\"\n\nHolmes smiled enigmatically, steepling his fingers beneath his chin. \"Indeed, I have. While you were engaged in your rounds, I have been piecing together the various threads of our client's narrative. The matter is not without its complexities, but I believe we are on the verge of a solution.\"\n\nHe gestured to a sheaf of notes upon the table. \"You recall, of course, the singular circumstances under which Miss Mary Sutherland sought our assistance? Her stepfather, Mr. Windibank, and the mysterious disappearance of her fiancé, Mr. Hosmer Angel?\"\n\nI nodded, the details of the case returning to me. \"It is a most perplexing affair. The manner in which Mr. Angel vanished, leaving no trace, is quite extraordinary.\"\n\n\"Extraordinary, perhaps, to the untrained observer,\" Holmes replied, his eyes twinkling. \"But to the student of human nature, the solution is elementary. Consider, Watson, the peculiarities of Mr. Angel's behaviour—the secrecy, the insistence upon correspondence, the avoidance of daylight meetings. What does this suggest to you?\"\n\nI pondered for a moment. \"It suggests a man with something to hide. Perhaps he feared discovery by a rival or an enemy.\"\n\nHolmes shook his head gently. \"Not a rival, Watson, but rather a man with a dual identity. I have reason to believe that Mr. Hosmer Angel and Mr. Windibank are one and the same.\"\n\nI stared at him in astonishment. \"But how can that be? Miss Sutherland would surely have recognised her own stepfather.\"\n\n\"Not necessarily,\" Holmes replied. \"Consider the use of tinted glasses, the false whiskers, the peculiar voice. All are devices to disguise one's appearance. Moreover, Mr. Windibank's frequent absences provided the perfect opportunity for him to assume the role of Mr. Angel. His motive is clear: to prevent Miss Sutherland from marrying and thus retain control of her income.\"\n\nI was silent for a moment, marvelling at the ingenuity of Holmes's reasoning. \"It is a most ingenious scheme,\" I admitted. \"But how can you be certain?\"\n\nHolmes smiled. \"I have written to Mr. Windibank, requesting his presence here tomorrow. I have little doubt that, when confronted with the evidence, he will be unable to maintain his deception.\"\n\nAs Holmes spoke, I felt once again the thrill of admiration for his remarkable powers of deduction. The case, which had seemed so baffling, was now laid bare by the clarity of his intellect. I resolved to be present at the interview on the morrow, eager to witness the final unmasking of the villain.\n\nThus, the evening passed in quiet conversation, Holmes expounding upon the subtleties of the case, while I listened with growing respect for my friend's extraordinary abilities. As the clock struck midnight, I retired to my room, my mind still occupied with the strange events of the day and the promise of further revelations to come."

He found, as so many more have done, that the practice is easier to attain than to get rid of, and for many years he continued to be a slave to the drug, an object of mingled horror and pity to his friends and relatives. I can see him now, with yellow, pasty face, drooping lids, and pin-point pupils, all huddled in a chair, the wreck and ruin of a noble man.\nOne night—it was in June, ’89—there came a ring to my bell, about the hour when a man gives his first yawn and glances at the clock. I sat up in my chair, and my wife laid her needle-work down in her lap and made a little face of disappointment.\n“A patient!” said she. “You’ll have to go out.”\nI groaned, for I was newly come back from a weary day.\nWe heard the door open, a few hurried words, and then quick steps upon the linoleum.

How you startled me, Kate! I had not an idea who you were when you came in.”\n“I didn’t know what to do, so I came straight to you.” That was always the way. Folk who were in grief came to my wife like birds to a lighthouse.\n“It was very sweet of you to come. Now, you must have some wine and water, and sit here comfortably and tell us all about it. Or should you rather that I sent James off to bed?”\n“Oh, no, no! I want the doctor’s advice and help, too. It’s about Isa. He has not been home for two days.

We soothed and comforted her by such words as we could find. Did she know where her husband was? Was it possible that we could bring him back to her?\nIt seems that it was. She had the surest information that of late he had, when the fit was on him, made use of an opium den in the farthest east of the City. Hitherto his orgies had always been confined to one day, and he had come back, twitching and shattered, in the evening. But now the spell had been upon him eight-and-forty hours, and he lay there, doubtless among the dregs of the docks, breathing in the poison or sleeping off the effects. There he was to be found, she was sure of it, at the Bar of Gold, in Upper Swandam Lane. But what was she to do? How could she, a young and timid woman, make her way into such a place and pluck her husband out from among the ruffians who surrounded him?\nThere was the case, and of course there was but one way out of it. Might I not escort her to this place? And then, as a second thought, why should she come at all? I was Isa Whitney’s medical adviser, and as such I had influence over him. I could manage it better if I were alone. I promised her on my word that I would send him home in a cab within two hours if he were indeed at the address which she had given me.

            "prefix-probing": "I had heard of his addiction from Holmes, who had, on more than one occasion, been consulted by the family in an effort to reclaim the unfortunate man from the clutches of the drug. It was, therefore, with no great surprise that I received a hurried note from Mrs. Whitney, imploring me to come to her aid. Her husband, she said, had been missing for two days, and she feared that he had once more fallen into the hands of his old associates in the opium den near the docks.\n\nHolmes was out upon one of his cases, and so I set forth alone, making my way through the misty streets of London to the squalid quarter where such dens were to be found. The air was thick with the sickly-sweet odour of the drug, and the faces that peered at me from the shadows were those of men and women who had long since abandoned hope. I made inquiries at several establishments before I found the one to which I had been directed by Mrs. Whitney’s anxious letter.\n\nThe place was a low, ill-lit room, filled with the forms of men stretched out upon wooden bunks, their faces pale and drawn, their eyes glazed with the effects of the opiate. The proprietor, a sinister-looking fellow with a yellow face and a perpetual grin, eyed me with suspicion as I entered.\n\n“I am looking for Mr. Isa Whitney,” I said, showing him the note I had received. “He is a tall man, with a thin face and a slight stoop. Have you seen him here?”\n\nThe man nodded slowly, his grin widening. “He comes here often, sir. He is in the back room now, I believe. You may go in and see for yourself.”\n\nI thanked him and made my way through the maze of sleeping and half-conscious figures, my heart heavy with the thought of the misery that surrounded me. In the farthest corner of the room, I found Isa Whitney, lying upon a narrow pallet, his eyes closed and his breathing slow and regular. I shook him gently by the shoulder, and after a moment he opened his eyes and stared at me in bewilderment.\n\n“Watson!” he murmured. “Is it really you? What brings you to this place?”\n\n“I have come to take you home, Whitney,” I replied. “Your wife is anxious about you. You have been away for two days.”\n\nHe sat up slowly, rubbing his eyes. “Two days? Is it so long? I had no idea. The time passes so strangely here. I meant to go home, but I could not tear myself away.”\n\nI helped him to his feet and led him out into the fresh air, where he seemed to revive somewhat. As we walked together through the foggy streets, he told me in broken sentences of his struggles with the drug, and of the despair that had driven him to seek its oblivion once more.\n\nWhen at last I had seen him safely into a cab and on his way home, I turned my steps back toward Baker Street, my mind filled with thoughts of the strange and tragic cases that Holmes and I had encountered in our years together. Little did I know that this night’s adventure was but the prelude to a far more mysterious and dangerous affair, one that would test all of Holmes’s powers of deduction and bring us face to face with one of the most cunning adversaries we had ever encountered.\n\nAs I entered our rooms, I found Holmes seated by the fire, his keen eyes fixed upon the flames. He looked up as I entered, a faint smile playing about his lips.\n\n“Ah, Watson,” he said. “I see you have been out upon an errand of mercy. How is our friend Whitney?”\n\n“He is safe at home, thanks to your timely warning,” I replied. “But I fear that his struggle is far from over.”\n\nHolmes nodded gravely. “The bonds of habit are not easily broken, my dear Watson. But we must do what we can. Now, if you are not too fatigued, I have a matter of some urgency to discuss with you. It concerns a most singular case, one which I believe will interest you greatly.”\n\nI seated myself opposite him, eager as always to hear of a new mystery. Holmes drew from his pocket a letter, which he handed to me without a word. I unfolded it and read the following:\n\n‘My dear Mr. Holmes,\n\nI am in the gravest distress, and beg for your immediate assistance. My husband has disappeared under the most inexplicable circumstances, and I fear that some terrible fate has befallen him. I implore you to come to my aid at once.\n\nYours faithfully,\nMary St. Clair’\n\nHolmes watched me closely as I finished reading. “Well, Watson, what do you make of it?”\n\n“It is certainly a most curious case,” I replied. “What do you propose to do?”\n\n“I propose that we go at once to the lady’s residence and see what light she can throw upon the matter. There is not a moment to be lost.”\n\nAnd so, within the hour, we found ourselves speeding through the London streets in a hansom cab, bound for the home of Mrs. St. Clair and the beginning of one of the most remarkable adventures in the annals of Sherlock Holmes."

Upper Swandam Lane is a vile alley lurking behind the high wharves which line the north side of the river to the east of London Bridge. Between a slop-shop and a gin-shop, approached by a steep flight of steps leading down to a black gap like the mouth of a cave, I found the den of which I was in search. Ordering my cab to wait, I passed down the steps, worn hollow in the centre by the ceaseless tread of drunken feet; and by the light of a flickering oil-lamp above the door I found the latch and made my way into a long, low room, thick and heavy with the brown opium smoke, and terraced with wooden berths, like the forecastle of an emigrant ship.\nThrough the gloom one could dimly catch a glimpse of bodies lying in strange fantastic poses, bowed shoulders, bent knees, heads thrown back, and chins pointing upward, with here and there a dark, lack-lustre eye turned upon the newcomer. Out of the black shadows there glimmered little red circles of light, now bright, now faint, as the burning poison waxed or waned in the bowls of the metal pipes. The most lay silent, but some muttered to themselves, and others talked together in a strange, low, monotonous voice, their conversation coming in gushes, and then suddenly tailing off into silence, each mumbling out his own thoughts and paying little heed to the words of his neighbour. At the farther end was a small brazier of burning charcoal, beside which on a three-legged wooden stool there sat a tall, thin old man, with his jaw resting upon his two fists, and his elbows upon his knees, staring into the fire.\nAs I entered, a sallow Malay attendant had hurried up with a pipe for me and a supply of the drug, beckoning me to an empty berth.\n“Thank you. I have not come to stay,” said I. “There is a friend of mine here, Mr. Isa Whitney, and I wish to speak with him.”\nThere was a movement and an exclamation from my right, and peering through the gloom, I saw Whitney, pale, haggard, and unkempt, staring out at me.\n“My God! It’s Watson,” said he. He was in a pitiable state of reaction, with every nerve in a twitter. “I say, Watson, what o’clock is it?”\n“Nearly eleven.”\n“Of what day?”\n“Of Friday, June 19th.”\n“Good heavens! I thought it was Wednesday. It is Wednesday. What d’you want to frighten a chap for?” He sank his face onto his arms and began to sob in a high treble key.\n“I tell you that it is Friday, man. Your wife has been waiting this two days for you. You should be ashamed of yourself!”\n“So I am. But you’ve got mixed, Watson, for I have only been here a few hours, three pipes, four pipes—I forget how many. But I’ll go home with you. I wouldn’t frighten Kate—poor little Kate. Give me your hand! Have you a cab?”\n“Yes, I have one waiting.”\n“Then I shall go in it. But I must owe something. Find what I owe, Watson. I am all off colour. I can do nothing for myself.”\nI walked down the narrow passage between the double row of sleepers, holding my breath to keep out the vile, stupefying fumes of the drug, and looking about for the manager. As I passed the tall man who sat by the brazier I felt a sudden pluck at my skirt, and a low voice whispered, “Walk past me, and then look back at me.” The words fell quite distinctly upon my ear. I glanced down. They could only have come from the old man at my side, and yet he sat now as absorbed as ever, very thin, very wrinkled, bent with age, an opium pipe dangling down from between his knees, as though it had dropped in sheer lassitude from his fingers. I took two steps forward and looked back. It took all my self-control to prevent me from breaking out into a cry of astonishment. He had turned his back so that none could see him but I. His form had filled out, his wrinkles were gone, the dull eyes had regained their fire, and there, sitting by the fire and grinning at my surprise, was none other than Sherlock Holmes. He made a slight motion to me to approach him, and instantly, as he turned his face half round to the company once more, subsided into a doddering, loose-lipped senility.\n“Holmes!” I whispered, “what on earth are you doing in this den?”\n“As low as you can,” he answered; “I have excellent ears. If you would have the great kindness to get rid of that sottish friend of yours I should be exceedingly glad to have a little talk with you.”\n“I have a cab outside.”\n“Then pray send him home in it. You may safely trust him, for he appears to be too limp to get into any mischief. I should recommend you also to send a note by the cabman to your wife to say that you have thrown in your lot with me. If you will wait outside, I shall be with you in five minutes.”",

            "prefix-probing": "I had no difficulty in finding the house, nor in making my observations. The house was a large, old-fashioned, red-brick building, standing back from the road, with a curving drive running up to the front door. It was surrounded by a high brick wall topped with broken glass, and the only entrance was a small iron gate, which was closed but not locked. I strolled up and down the road, looking at the house and its surroundings, and trying to form some idea of the people who lived there. There was a well-kept lawn in front of the house, and a number of flower-beds, which showed that someone took an interest in gardening. The windows were large and well-cleaned, and there were white curtains behind them. Altogether, the house had an air of quiet respectability, and I could see nothing to suggest that anything out of the ordinary had ever happened there.\n\nI walked past the house several times, and at last I saw a man come out of the front door and walk down the drive. He was a tall, thin man, with a long, sallow face and a black moustache. He was dressed in a dark suit, and he wore a black bowler hat. He walked with a quick, nervous step, and he glanced up and down the road as if he were afraid of being followed. I watched him until he turned the corner and disappeared from sight. Then I walked up to the gate and looked in. There was no one in sight, so I opened the gate and walked up the drive.\n\nAs I approached the house, I saw that the front door was open, and a woman was standing in the doorway. She was a middle-aged woman, with a kind, motherly face and a neat, black dress. She looked at me with some surprise, but she did not seem alarmed.\n\n\"Can I help you, sir?\" she asked.\n\n\"I am looking for Mr. Hosmer Angel,\" I said. \"I was told that he lived here.\"\n\nThe woman looked at me in surprise. \"Mr. Hosmer Angel?\" she repeated. \"There is no one of that name living here, sir.\"\n\n\"Are you quite sure?\" I asked. \"I was given this address.\"\n\n\"Quite sure, sir. I have lived here for twenty years, and I have never heard of anyone called Hosmer Angel.\"\n\nI thanked her and walked back down the drive. I was puzzled, but I was not discouraged. I knew that Holmes would not have sent me on a wild-goose chase, and I was determined to get to the bottom of the mystery. I walked back to the main road and stood for a few minutes, thinking over what I had learned. It was clear that Mr. Hosmer Angel did not live at the address I had been given, but that did not mean that he had never been there. It was possible that he had used the address for some purpose of his own, or that he had some connection with the people who lived there.\n\nI decided to make some further inquiries. I walked down the road to the nearest shop and went in. The shopkeeper was a friendly, talkative man, and I soon got into conversation with him. I asked him if he knew anything about Mr. Hosmer Angel, or if he had ever seen a man answering to his description. The shopkeeper shook his head.\n\n\"No, sir,\" he said. \"I don't know anyone of that name, and I don't think I've ever seen a man like that around here.\"\n\nI thanked him and went out. I made several other inquiries in the neighborhood, but I could find no one who had ever heard of Mr. Hosmer Angel. It was becoming clear to me that the address I had been given was a blind, and that Mr. Angel had never lived there. I began to see the outlines of a very clever plot, and I was more than ever determined to get to the bottom of it.\n\nI returned to Baker Street and reported my findings to Holmes. He listened attentively, and when I had finished, he smiled.\n\n\"You have done very well, Watson,\" he said. \"You have confirmed my suspicions. The address was a blind, and Mr. Hosmer Angel never lived there. But we are getting closer to the truth.\"\n\nHe took a sheet of paper from his desk and handed it to me. \"Look at this,\" he said.\n\nI looked at the paper. It was a letter, written in a peculiar, angular handwriting. The letter was addressed to Miss Mary Sutherland, and it was signed \"Hosmer Angel.\"\n\n\"Notice anything peculiar about the handwriting?\" Holmes asked.\n\nI examined the letter carefully. The handwriting was certainly unusual, but I could not see anything particularly remarkable about it.\n\n\"It is written in a disguised hand,\" Holmes said. \"And if you look closely, you will see that the letters are formed in a way that suggests the writer was trying to conceal his identity.\"\n\nI looked again, and I saw that Holmes was right. The letters were oddly shaped, and there was a curious stiffness about them, as if the writer had been using his left hand instead of his right.\n\n\"Exactly,\" said Holmes. \"The writer was trying to disguise his handwriting. And now, Watson, let us consider what we know. We have a man who calls himself Hosmer Angel, who writes in a disguised hand, who gives a false address, and who disappears mysteriously on the day of his wedding. What does that suggest to you?\"\n\n\"It suggests that he was not what he seemed,\" I said. \"That he was playing a part for some reason.\"\n\n\"Precisely,\" said Holmes. \"And now, let us see if we can discover what that reason was.\""

Then, glancing quickly round, he straightened himself out and burst into a hearty fit of laughter.\n“I suppose, Watson,” said he, “that you imagine that I have added opium-smoking to cocaine injections, and all the other little weaknesses on which you have favoured me with your medical views.”\n“I was certainly surprised to find you there.”\n“But not more so than I to find you.”\n“I came to find a friend.”\n“And I to find an enemy.”\n“An enemy?”\n“Yes; one of my natural enemies, or, shall I say, my natural prey. Briefly, Watson, I am in the midst of a very remarkable inquiry, and I have hoped to find a clue in the incoherent ramblings of these sots, as I have done before now. Had I been recognised in that den my life would not have been worth an hour’s purchase; for I have used it before now for my own purposes, and the rascally Lascar who runs it has sworn to have vengeance upon me. There is a trap-door at the back of that building, near the corner of Paul’s Wharf, which could tell some strange tales of what has passed through it upon the moonless nights.”\n“What! You do not mean bodies?”\n“Ay, bodies, Watson. We should be rich men if we had £ 1000 for every poor devil who has been done to death in that den. It is the vilest murder-trap on the whole riverside, and I fear that Neville St. Clair has entered it never to leave it more. But our trap should be here.” He put his two forefingers between his teeth and whistled shrilly—a signal which was answered by a similar whistle from the distance, followed shortly by the rattle of wheels and the clink of horses’ hoofs.\n“Now, Watson,” said Holmes, as a tall dog-cart dashed up through the gloom, throwing out two golden tunnels of yellow light from its side lanterns. “You’ll come with me, won’t you?”\n“If I can be of use.”\n“Oh, a trusty comrade is always of use; and a chronicler still more so. My room at The Cedars is a double-bedded one.”\n“The Cedars?”\n“Yes; that is Mr. St. Clair’s house. I am staying there while I conduct the inquiry.”\n“Where is it, then?”\n“Near Lee, in Kent. We have a seven-mile drive before us.”\n“But I am all in the dark.”\n“Of course you are. You’ll know all about it presently. Jump up here. All right, John; we shall not need you. Here’s half a crown. Look out for me to-morrow, about eleven. Give her her head. So long, then!”\nHe flicked the horse with his whip, and we dashed away through the endless succession of sombre and deserted streets, which widened gradually, until we were flying across a broad balustraded bridge, with the murky river flowing sluggishly beneath us. Beyond lay another dull wilderness of bricks and mortar, its silence broken only by the heavy, regular footfall of the policeman, or the songs and shouts of some belated party of revellers. A dull wrack was drifting slowly across the sky, and a star or two twinkled dimly here and there through the rifts of the clouds. Holmes drove in silence, with his head sunk upon his breast, and the air of a man who is lost in thought, while I sat beside him, curious to learn what this new quest might be which seemed to tax his powers so sorely, and yet afraid to break in upon the current of his thoughts. We had driven several miles, and were beginning to get to the fringe of the belt of suburban villas, when he shook himself, shrugged his shoulders, and lit up his pipe with the air of a man who has satisfied himself that he is acting for the best.\n“You have a grand gift of silence, Watson,” said he. “It makes you quite invaluable as a companion. ’Pon my word, it is a great thing for me to have someone to talk to, for my own thoughts are not over-pleasant. I was wondering what I should say to this dear little woman to-night when she meets me at the door.”\n“You forget that I know nothing about it.”\n“I shall just have time to tell you the facts of the case before we get to Lee. It seems absurdly simple, and yet, somehow I can get nothing to go upon. There’s plenty of thread, no doubt, but I can’t get the end of it into my hand. Now, I’ll state the case clearly and concisely to you, Watson, and maybe you can see a spark where all is dark to me.”\n“Proceed, then.”\n“Some years ago—to be definite, in May, 1884—there came to Lee a gentleman, Neville St. Clair by name, who appeared to have plenty of money. He took a large villa, laid out the grounds very nicely, and lived generally in good style. By degrees he made friends in the neighbourhood, and in 1887 he married the daughter of a local brewer, by whom he now has two children. He had no occupation, but was interested in several companies and went into town as a rule in the morning, returning by the 5:14 from Cannon Street every night. Mr. St. Clair is now thirty-seven years of age, is a man of temperate habits, a good husband, a very affectionate father, and a man who is popular with all who know him. I may add that his whole debts at the present moment, as far as we have been able to ascertain, amount to £ 88 10s., while he has £ 220 standing to his credit in the Capital and Counties Bank. There is no reason, therefore, to think that money troubles have been weighing upon his mind.\n“Last Monday Mr. Neville St. Clair went into town rather earlier than usual, remarking before he started that he had two important commissions to perform, and that he would bring his little boy home a box of bricks. Now, by the merest chance, his wife received a telegram upon this same Monday, very shortly after his departure, to the effect that a small parcel of considerable value which she had been expecting was waiting for her at the offices of the Aberdeen Shipping Company. Now, if you are well up in your London, you will know that the office of the company is in Fresno Street, which branches out of Upper Swandam Lane, where you found me to-night. Mrs. St. Clair had her lunch, started for the City, did some shopping, proceeded to the company’s office, got her packet, and found herself at exactly 4:35 walking through Swandam Lane on her way back to the station. Have you followed me so far?”\n“It is very clear.”\n“If you remember, Monday was an exceedingly hot day, and Mrs. St. Clair walked slowly, glancing about in the hope of seeing a cab, as she did not like the neighbourhood in which she found herself. While she was walking in this way down Swandam Lane, she suddenly heard an ejaculation or cry, and was struck cold to see her husband looking down at her and, as it seemed to her, beckoning to her from a second-floor window. The window was open, and she distinctly saw his face, which she describes as being terribly agitated. He waved his hands frantically to her, and then vanished from the window so suddenly that it seemed to her that he had been plucked back by some irresistible force from behind. One singular point which struck her quick feminine eye was that although he wore some dark coat, such as he had started to town in, he had on neither collar nor necktie.\n“Convinced that something was amiss with him, she rushed down the steps—for the house was none other than the opium den in which you found me to-night—and running through the front room she attempted to ascend the stairs which led to the first floor. At the foot of the stairs, however, she met this Lascar scoundrel of whom I have spoken, who thrust her back and, aided by a Dane, who acts as assistant there, pushed her out into the street. Filled with the most maddening doubts and fears, she rushed down the lane and, by rare good-fortune, met in Fresno Street a number of constables with an inspector, all on their way to their beat. The inspector and two men accompanied her back, and in spite of the continued resistance of the proprietor, they made their way to the room in which Mr. St. Clair had last been seen. There was no sign of him there. In fact, in the whole of that floor there was no one to be found save a crippled wretch of hideous aspect, who, it seems, made his home there. Both he and the Lascar stoutly swore that no one else had been in the front room during the afternoon. So determined was their denial that the inspector was staggered, and had almost come to believe that Mrs. St. Clair had been deluded when, with a cry, she sprang at a small deal box which lay upon the table and tore the lid from it. Out there fell a cascade of children’s bricks. It was the toy which he had promised to bring home.\n“This discovery, and the evident confusion which the cripple showed, made the inspector realise that the matter was serious. The rooms were carefully examined, and results all pointed to an abominable crime. The front room was plainly furnished as a sitting-room and led into a small bedroom, which looked out upon the back of one of the wharves. Between the wharf and the bedroom window is a narrow strip, which is dry at low tide but is covered at high tide with at least four and a half feet of water. The bedroom window was a broad one and opened from below. On examination traces of blood were to be seen upon the windowsill, and several scattered drops were visible upon the wooden floor of the bedroom. Thrust away behind a curtain in the front room were all the clothes of Mr. Neville St. Clair, with the exception of his coat. His boots, his socks, his hat, and his watch—all were there. There were no signs of violence upon any of these garments, and there were no other traces of Mr. Neville St. Clair. Out of the window he must apparently have gone for no other exit could be discovered, and the ominous bloodstains upon the sill gave little promise that he could save himself by swimming, for the tide was at its very highest at the moment of the tragedy.\n“And now as to the villains who seemed to be immediately implicated in the matter. The Lascar was known to be a man of the vilest antecedents, but as, by Mrs. St. Clair’s story, he was known to have been at the foot of the stair within a very few seconds of her husband’s appearance at the window, he could hardly have been more than an accessory to the crime. His defence was one of absolute ignorance, and he protested that he had no knowledge as to the doings of Hugh Boone, his lodger, and that he could not account in any way for the presence of the missing gentleman’s clothes.\n“So much for the Lascar manager. Now for the sinister cripple who lives upon the second floor of the opium den, and who was certainly the last human being whose eyes rested upon Neville St. Clair. His name is Hugh Boone, and his hideous face is one which is familiar to every man who goes much to the City. He is a professional beggar, though in order to avoid the police regulations he pretends to a small trade in wax vestas. Some little distance down Threadneedle Street, upon the left-hand side, there is, as you may have remarked, a small angle in the wall. Here it is that this creature takes his daily seat, cross-legged with his tiny stock of matches on his lap, and as he is a piteous spectacle a small rain of charity descends into the greasy leather cap which lies upon the pavement beside him. I have watched the fellow more than once before ever I thought of making his professional acquaintance, and I have been surprised at the harvest which he has reaped in a short time. His appearance, you see, is so remarkable that no one can pass him without observing him. A shock of orange hair, a pale face disfigured by a horrible scar, which, by its contraction, has turned up the outer edge of his upper lip, a bulldog chin, and a pair of very penetrating dark eyes, which present a singular contrast to the colour of his hair, all mark him out from amid the common crowd of mendicants and so, too, does his wit, for he is ever ready with a reply to any piece of chaff which may be thrown at him by the passers-by. This is the man whom we now learn to have been the lodger at the opium den, and to have been the last man to see the gentleman of whom we are in quest.”\n“But a cripple!” said I. “What could he have done single-handed against a man in the prime of life?”\n“He is a cripple in the sense that he walks with a limp; but in other respects he appears to be a powerful and well-nurtured man. Surely your medical experience would tell you, Watson, that weakness in one limb is often compensated for by exceptional strength in the others.”\n“Pray continue your narrative.”\n“Mrs. St. Clair had fainted at the sight of the blood upon the window, and she was escorted home in a cab by the police, as her presence could be of no help to them in their investigations. Inspector Barton, who had charge of the case, made a very careful examination of the premises, but without finding anything which threw any light upon the matter. One mistake had been made in not arresting Boone instantly, as he was allowed some few minutes during which he might have communicated with his friend the Lascar, but this fault was soon remedied, and he was seized and searched, without anything being found which could incriminate him. There were, it is true, some blood-stains upon his right shirt-sleeve, but he pointed to his ring-finger, which had been cut near the nail, and explained that the bleeding came from there, adding that he had been to the window not long before, and that the stains which had been observed there came doubtless from the same source. He denied strenuously having ever seen Mr. Neville St. Clair and swore that the presence of the clothes in his room was as much a mystery to him as to the police. As to Mrs. St. Clair’s assertion that she had actually seen her husband at the window, he declared that she must have been either mad or dreaming. He was removed, loudly protesting, to the police-station, while the inspector remained upon the premises in the hope that the ebbing tide might afford some fresh clue.\n“And it did, though they hardly found upon the mud-bank what they had feared to find. It was Neville St. Clair’s coat, and not Neville St. Clair, which lay uncovered as the tide receded. And what do you think they found in the pockets?”\n“I cannot imagine.”\n“No, I don’t think you would guess. Every pocket stuffed with pennies and half-pennies—421 pennies and 270 half-pennies. It was no wonder that it had not been swept away by the tide. But a human body is a different matter. There is a fierce eddy between the wharf and the house. It seemed likely enough that the weighted coat had remained when the stripped body had been sucked away into the river.”\n“But I understand that all the other clothes were found in the room. Would the body be dressed in a coat alone?”\n“No, sir, but the facts might be met speciously enough. Suppose that this man Boone had thrust Neville St. Clair through the window, there is no human eye which could have seen the deed. What would he do then? It would of course instantly strike him that he must get rid of the tell-tale garments. He would seize the coat, then, and be in the act of throwing it out, when it would occur to him that it would swim and not sink. He has little time, for he has heard the scuffle downstairs when the wife tried to force her way up, and perhaps he has already heard from his Lascar confederate that the police are hurrying up the street. There is not an instant to be lost. He rushes to some secret hoard, where he has accumulated the fruits of his beggary, and he stuffs all the coins upon which he can lay his hands into the pockets to make sure of the coat’s sinking. He throws it out, and would have done the same with the other garments had not he heard the rush of steps below, and only just had time to close the window when the police appeared.”\n“It certainly sounds feasible.”\n“Well, we will take it as a working hypothesis for want of a better. Boone, as I have told you, was arrested and taken to the station, but it could not be shown that there had ever before been anything against him. He had for years been known as a professional beggar, but his life appeared to have been a very quiet and innocent one. There the matter stands at present, and the questions which have to be solved—what Neville St. Clair was doing in the opium den, what happened to him when there, where is he now, and what Hugh Boone had to do with his disappearance—are all as far from a solution as ever. I confess that I cannot recall any case within my experience which looked at the first glance so simple and yet which presented such difficulties.”",

            "prefix-probing": "He had a way of making his wishes seem not only reasonable but inevitable, as though the course of action he suggested was the only one that could possibly be taken. On this particular morning, as the pale November light filtered through the curtains of our Baker Street sitting-room, Holmes sat in his usual armchair, his long, thin fingers steepled beneath his chin, and his keen grey eyes fixed upon me with an expression of gentle amusement.\n\n“Watson,” he said, “I find myself in need of your company and your medical expertise. There is a matter which has come to my attention, and I believe your presence may prove invaluable.”\n\nI set aside the newspaper I had been perusing, for I knew from experience that Holmes would not make such a request lightly. “Of course, Holmes,” I replied. “You know you have but to ask.”\n\nHe smiled faintly. “Excellent. I have received a letter this morning from a certain Lady Frances Carfax, who finds herself in a most peculiar predicament. She is currently residing at the Langham Hotel, and she requests my assistance in a matter which she describes as both delicate and urgent.”\n\nI raised my eyebrows. “Lady Frances Carfax? The name is familiar.”\n\n“Indeed,” Holmes replied. “She is the daughter of the late Earl of Rufton, and a woman of considerable means, though her circumstances have become somewhat straitened of late. Her letter is couched in the most careful terms, but I detect a note of genuine distress beneath the surface.”\n\nHe handed me the letter, and I read it with growing interest. Lady Frances wrote of strange occurrences at the hotel: mysterious footsteps in the corridor at night, the disappearance of a valuable brooch, and the persistent feeling that she was being watched. She implored Holmes to come at once, or, if he could not, to send someone in his stead.\n\nHolmes watched me closely as I finished reading. “Well, Watson, what do you make of it?”\n\n“It is certainly a curious case,” I replied. “Do you suspect foul play?”\n\n“I suspect that Lady Frances is in some danger, though the precise nature of that danger is not yet clear. That is why I wish you to accompany me to the Langham. Your medical knowledge may be of use, and your presence will, I am sure, be a comfort to Lady Frances.”\n\nI agreed at once, and within the hour we were on our way to the hotel. Holmes was silent during the cab ride, his mind clearly occupied with the details of the case. I, for my part, could not help but feel a thrill of anticipation. There was always a certain excitement in being drawn into one of Holmes’s investigations, and this case promised to be particularly intriguing.\n\nAt the Langham, we were shown to Lady Frances’s suite, where we found her pacing nervously. She was a tall, elegant woman, with a proud bearing and a face that bore the marks of recent anxiety. She greeted Holmes with obvious relief, and after a few words of introduction, she launched into her story.\n\n“I fear I am in great danger, Mr. Holmes,” she said. “For the past week, I have been plagued by a series of strange events. At first, I thought it was merely my imagination, but now I am convinced that someone means me harm.”\n\nShe described the missing brooch, the footsteps in the night, and the sense of being watched. Holmes listened intently, asking occasional questions, but mostly allowing Lady Frances to speak uninterrupted. When she had finished, he sat back in his chair and regarded her thoughtfully.\n\n“Tell me, Lady Frances, have you any enemies? Anyone who might wish you ill?”\n\nShe shook her head. “None that I know of. I have always tried to live quietly and avoid scandal.”\n\n“And your family? Are there any disputes over your inheritance?”\n\nShe hesitated. “There is my cousin, Sir Reginald Carfax. He has always resented the fact that I inherited the family estate, but I cannot believe he would stoop to such measures.”\n\nHolmes nodded. “I see. And the staff here at the hotel? Have you noticed anything unusual in their behaviour?”\n\n“Not particularly. The maid assigned to my rooms is a quiet, respectable girl, and the other staff seem above reproach.”\n\nHolmes rose and began to pace the room, his hands clasped behind his back. “I should like to examine your rooms, if I may.”\n\nLady Frances assented, and Holmes proceeded to inspect every corner of the suite with his usual thoroughness. He examined the locks on the doors and windows, the contents of the wardrobe, and even the pattern of dust on the mantelpiece. At length, he paused by the window and looked out into the street below.\n\n“Watson,” he said, “come here, if you please.”\n\nI joined him at the window, and he pointed to a man standing on the opposite pavement. The man was tall and thin, with a sallow complexion and a furtive air. He seemed to be watching the hotel intently.\n\n“Have you seen that man before, Lady Frances?” Holmes asked.\n\nShe peered out the window and gasped. “Yes! I have seen him several times in the past few days. He always seems to be lurking nearby.”\n\nHolmes’s eyes gleamed. “I think we may have found the source of your troubles, Lady Frances. Watson, would you be so good as to keep an eye on our friend while I make a few inquiries?”\n\nI agreed, and Holmes slipped quietly from the room. I watched the man across the street, noting his every movement. He seemed nervous, glancing up at the windows of the hotel and shifting from foot to foot. After a few minutes, Holmes returned, his expression grave.\n\n“I have spoken to the hotel manager,” he said. “It seems that our friend has been seen loitering in the vicinity for several days. The staff assumed he was waiting for someone, but no one has ever come to meet him.”\n\nHolmes turned to Lady Frances. “I believe you are in real danger, madam. I would advise you to remain in your rooms and admit no one unless you are certain of their identity. Watson and I will keep watch tonight.”\n\nLady Frances thanked us, and we took up our positions in the sitting-room. The hours passed slowly, and the only sounds were the ticking of the clock and the occasional creak of the floorboards. At midnight, there was a soft tap at the door.\n\nHolmes motioned for silence, and I crept to the door, my revolver in hand. “Who is it?” I called softly.\n\nThere was no answer. Holmes nodded, and I flung open the door. The corridor was empty, but at the far end I caught a glimpse of a shadowy figure disappearing around the corner.\n\nHolmes was after him in an instant, and I followed close behind. We raced down the corridor and out into the street, but the man had vanished. Holmes examined the pavement carefully, searching for any clue that might reveal the man’s identity or destination.\n\nAt last, he straightened up. “He is a clever one, Watson. But he has left us a clue.”\n\nHe pointed to a scrap of paper lying on the ground. I picked it up and saw that it was a torn corner of an envelope, with the words ‘Carfax Estate’ written in a bold hand.\n\nHolmes smiled. “I think we have our answer, Watson. We must pay a visit to the Carfax estate at once.”\n\nWe returned to the hotel to inform Lady Frances of our discovery. She was understandably alarmed, but agreed that it would be best to confront the matter directly. Early the next morning, we set out for the Carfax estate, accompanied by Lady Frances and a constable provided by the local police.\n\nThe estate was a grand old house, set amid rolling lawns and ancient trees. Sir Reginald Carfax greeted us with a mixture of surprise and suspicion. Holmes explained the situation, and Sir Reginald professed complete ignorance of any plot against his cousin.\n\nHolmes was not convinced. He asked to see the household staff, and questioned them closely about the events of the past week. One of the footmen, a nervous young man named Jenkins, seemed particularly ill at ease. Holmes pressed him, and at last he broke down and confessed that he had been approached by a stranger who offered him money to leave a window unlatched at night.\n\nHolmes turned to Sir Reginald. “I think you will find that your cousin’s life has been in real danger. I would advise you to take every precaution.”\n\nSir Reginald, now thoroughly alarmed, promised to do so. Holmes and I returned to London, satisfied that we had averted a tragedy.\n\nAs we sat once more in our Baker Street rooms, Holmes turned to me with a smile. “You see, Watson, it is often the smallest clue that leads to the solution of the greatest mystery.”\n\nI could only agree, marvelling once again at the brilliance of my friend, Sherlock Holmes."

See that light among the trees? That is The Cedars, and beside that lamp sits a woman whose anxious ears have already, I have little doubt, caught the clink of our horse’s feet.”\n“But why are you not conducting the case from Baker Street?” I asked.\n“Because there are many inquiries which must be made out here.

I hate to meet her, Watson, when I have no news of her husband. Here we are. Whoa, there, whoa!”\nWe had pulled up in front of a large villa which stood within its own grounds. A stable-boy had run out to the horse’s head, and springing down, I followed Holmes up the small, winding gravel-drive which led to the house. As we approached, the door flew open, and a little blonde woman stood in the opening, clad in some sort of light mousseline de soie, with a touch of fluffy pink chiffon at her neck and wrists. She stood with her figure outlined against the flood of light, one hand upon the door, one half-raised in her eagerness, her body slightly bent, her head and face protruded, with eager eyes and parted lips, a standing question.\n“Well?” she cried, “well?” And then, seeing that there were two of us, she gave a cry of hope which sank into a groan as she saw that my companion shook his head and shrugged his shoulders.\n“No good news?”\n“None.”\n“No bad?”\n“No.”\n“Thank God for that.

Perhaps.”\n“And on what day did he meet his death?”\n“On Monday.”\n“Then perhaps, Mr. Holmes, you will be good enough to explain how it is that I have received a letter from him to-day.”",

            "prefix-probing": "Presently, the carriage turned from the high road into a narrow lane, deeply rutted, with overhanging hedges of bramble and hawthorn. The air was fresh and sweet with the scent of the fields, and the early morning sun cast long shadows across the winding path. Holmes sat in silence, his keen eyes fixed upon the landscape, while I, still pondering the curious details of the case, could not help but feel a mounting sense of anticipation.\n\nAt length, our vehicle drew up before a low, rambling house of grey stone, half hidden by a tangle of creepers and ancient trees. A gravel path led to the door, where a tall, thin man awaited us, his face pale and anxious. He greeted us with a nervous gesture, glancing from Holmes to myself as though seeking reassurance.\n\n\"You are Mr. Sherlock Holmes?\" he inquired, his voice trembling slightly.\n\n\"I am. And this is my friend and colleague, Dr. Watson. You are Mr. Holder, I presume?\"\n\n\"Yes, yes. Pray come in, gentlemen. I am most grateful for your prompt response.\"\n\nHe led us into a dimly lit drawing-room, where the heavy curtains were still drawn against the morning light. The air was thick with the scent of old books and faded flowers. Mr. Holder motioned us to be seated, then took a chair opposite, wringing his hands in agitation.\n\n\"You must forgive my agitation, Mr. Holmes,\" he began. \"This affair has quite unstrung me. I scarcely know where to begin.\"\n\nHolmes regarded him with his usual calm.\n\n\"Perhaps you would be so good as to recount the events in your own words, Mr. Holder. Omit nothing, however trivial it may seem.\"\n\nMr. Holder drew a deep breath and began his narrative. As he spoke, Holmes listened intently, his fingers steepled beneath his chin, his eyes half closed in concentration. I took careful notes, for I knew from experience that the smallest detail might prove to be of the utmost importance.\n\nThe story was a strange one, involving a missing piece of valuable jewelry, a trusted employee, and a series of inexplicable occurrences. Mr. Holder's distress was evident, and more than once he paused to compose himself before continuing. Holmes asked a few pointed questions, eliciting further details, and I could see by the gleam in his eye that he was already forming his own theories.\n\nWhen Mr. Holder had finished, Holmes rose and paced the room, his hands clasped behind his back.\n\n\"Thank you, Mr. Holder. Your account has been most helpful. I should like to examine the scene of the incident, if you please.\"\n\nMr. Holder led us through a long corridor to a small study at the rear of the house. The room was in some disorder, with papers scattered across the desk and a chair overturned. Holmes moved about the room with swift, silent steps, his gaze darting from object to object. He paused by the window, examining the latch and the sill, then knelt to inspect the carpet near the desk.\n\n\"You say the window was fastened when you entered the room?\" he asked.\n\n\"Yes, quite securely. I am certain of it.\"\n\nHolmes nodded, then turned his attention to the desk. He examined the lock, the drawers, and the scattered papers with meticulous care. At length, he straightened and faced Mr. Holder.\n\n\"I believe I have all the information I require for the present. Dr. Watson and I will take a short walk about the grounds, if you have no objection.\"\n\n\"None at all, Mr. Holmes. I shall await your return here.\"\n\nWe stepped out into the crisp morning air, the dew still glistening on the grass. Holmes strode ahead, his eyes scanning the ground for any sign of disturbance. I followed in silence, marveling as always at his powers of observation.\n\nAfter a few minutes, Holmes paused and pointed to a faint mark in the soft earth beneath the study window.\n\n\"What do you make of this, Watson?\" he asked.\n\nI bent to examine the mark. It was the impression of a boot, sharp and distinct in the damp soil.\n\n\"Someone stood here recently,\" I said.\n\n\"Precisely. And note the direction of the toe—it points away from the house. Our visitor was in a hurry to depart. Come, let us see where these tracks lead.\""

I had left my chair and was gazing at it over his shoulder. The envelope was a very coarse one and was stamped with the Gravesend postmark and with the date of that very day, or rather of the day before, for it was considerably after midnight.\n“Coarse writing,” murmured Holmes. “Surely this is not your husband’s writing, madam.”\n“No, but the enclosure is.”\n“I perceive also that whoever addressed the envelope had to go and inquire as to the address.”\n“How can you tell that?”\n“The name, you see, is in perfectly black ink, which has dried itself. The rest is of the greyish colour, which shows that blotting-paper has been used. If it had been written straight off, and then blotted, none would be of a deep black shade. This man has written the name, and there has then been a pause before he wrote the address, which can only mean that he was not familiar with it. It is, of course, a trifle, but there is nothing so important as trifles. Let us now see the letter. Ha! there has been an enclosure here!”\n“Yes, there was a ring. His signet-ring.”\n“And you are sure that this is your husband’s hand?”\n“One of his hands.”\n“One?”\n“His hand when he wrote hurriedly. It is very unlike his usual writing, and yet I know it well.”\n“‘Dearest do not be frightened. All will come well. There is a huge error which it may take some little time to rectify. Wait in patience.—NEVILLE.’ Written in pencil upon the fly-leaf of a book, octavo size, no water-mark. Hum! Posted to-day in Gravesend by a man with a dirty thumb. Ha! And the flap has been gummed, if I am not very much in error, by a person who had been chewing tobacco. And you have no doubt that it is your husband’s hand, madam?”\n“None. Neville wrote those words.”\n“And they were posted to-day at Gravesend. Well, Mrs. St. Clair, the clouds lighten, though I should not venture to say that the danger is over.”\n“But he must be alive, Mr. Holmes.”\n“Unless this is a clever forgery to put us on the wrong scent. The ring, after all, proves nothing. It may have been taken from him.”\n“No, no; it is, it is his very own writing!”\n“Very well. It may, however, have been written on Monday and only posted to-day.”\n“That is possible.”\n“If so, much may have happened between.”\n“Oh, you must not discourage me, Mr. Holmes. I know that all is well with him. There is so keen a sympathy between us that I should know if evil came upon him. On the very day that I saw him last he cut himself in the bedroom, and yet I in the dining-room rushed upstairs instantly with the utmost certainty that something had happened. Do you think that I would respond to such a trifle and yet be ignorant of his death?”\n“I have seen too much not to know that the impression of a woman may be more valuable than the conclusion of an analytical reasoner. And in this letter you certainly have a very strong piece of evidence to corroborate your view. But if your husband is alive and able to write letters, why should he remain away from you?”\n“I cannot imagine. It is unthinkable.”\n“And on Monday he made no remarks before leaving you?”\n“No.”\n“And you were surprised to see him in Swandam Lane?”\n“Very much so.”\n“Was the window open?”\n“Yes.”\n“Then he might have called to you?”\n“He might.”\n“He only, as I understand, gave an inarticulate cry?”\n“Yes.”\n“A call for help, you thought?”\n“Yes. He waved his hands.”\n“But it might have been a cry of surprise. Astonishment at the unexpected sight of you might cause him to throw up his hands?”\n“It is possible.”\n“And you thought he was pulled back?”\n“He disappeared so suddenly.”\n“He might have leaped back. You did not see anyone else in the room?”\n“No, but this horrible man confessed to having been there, and the Lascar was at the foot of the stairs.”\n“Quite so. Your husband, as far as you could see, had his ordinary clothes on?”\n“But without his collar or tie. I distinctly saw his bare throat.”\n“Had he ever spoken of Swandam Lane?”\n“Never.”\n“Had he ever showed any signs of having taken opium?”\n“Never.”\n“Thank you, Mrs. St. Clair. Those are the principal points about which I wished to be absolutely clear. We shall now have a little supper and then retire, for we may have a very busy day to-morrow.”\nA large and comfortable double-bedded room had been placed at our disposal, and I was quickly between the sheets, for I was weary after my night of adventure. Sherlock Holmes was a man, however, who, when he had an unsolved problem upon his mind, would go for days, and even for a week, without rest, turning it over, rearranging his facts, looking at it from every point of view until he had either fathomed it or convinced himself that his data were insufficient. It was soon evident to me that he was now preparing for an all-night sitting. He took off his coat and waistcoat, put on a large blue dressing-gown, and then wandered about the room collecting pillows from his bed and cushions from the sofa and armchairs. With these he constructed a sort of Eastern divan, upon which he perched himself cross-legged, with an ounce of shag tobacco and a box of matches laid out in front of him. In the dim light of the lamp I saw him sitting there, an old briar pipe between his lips, his eyes fixed vacantly upon the corner of the ceiling, the blue smoke curling up from him, silent, motionless, with the light shining upon his strong-set aquiline features. So he sat as I dropped off to sleep, and so he sat when a sudden ejaculation caused me to wake up, and I found the summer sun shining into the apartment.",

                "refinement_prompt": "IMPROVEMENT GUIDANCE:\n1. MAJOR STRUCTURAL ISSUES:\n- The completion omits a significant portion of the original dialogue and investigation, especially the detailed questioning of Mrs. St. Clair about the events in Swandam Lane, her husband's behavior, and her own perceptions. \n- The completion invents a scene where Holmes and Watson exchange good-nights and Holmes explicitly says he is going to sleep, which does not occur in the original. The original instead describes Holmes preparing for an all-night session and Watson falling asleep while Holmes continues to think.\n\n2. MISSING ELEMENTS:\n- Early in the passage, the completion leaves out the detailed physical description and handling of the envelope and letter, including the specific observations about the ink and the process of deduction regarding the address.\n- The middle section is missing the extended dialogue where Holmes questions Mrs. St. Clair about her last interactions with her husband, the events at Swandam Lane, and her emotional conviction about his wellbeing.\n- The completion omits the discussion about the possibility of forgery, the significance of the ring, and Mrs. St. Clair's account of her intuition regarding her husband's fate.\n- The ending lacks the description of Holmes's methodical preparation for an all-night analysis, including the construction of the divan, his posture, and Watson's observations as he falls asleep and wakes up.\n\n3. INACCURATE ELEMENTS:\n- The completion inaccurately presents Holmes as preparing to sleep and wishing Watson good night, which is the opposite of his behavior in the original, where he stays up to think.\n- The sequence of events is altered: in the original, the investigative dialogue and deductions continue much longer before the transition to the night scene, whereas the completion shortens this and moves to the night prematurely.\n- The completion attributes invented lines and actions to Holmes and Watson that are not present in the original, such as Holmes expressing satisfaction with the results and explicitly stating his intention to sleep.\n- The completion omits the time details about it being after midnight and the summer sun shining in the morning, which are present in the original and help set the scene's chronology."

            "prefix-probing": "Sherlock Holmes sprang out of his chair as if he had been galvanised. The expression of languor had vanished from his face, and his eyes were bright and eager. He leaned forward with a keen, alert interest, his long, thin fingers steepled together in front of him. \n\n\"Pray continue,\" he said. \"You have aroused my curiosity.\"\n\nThe visitor, a nervous young woman, glanced anxiously at Holmes and then at me. She seemed to gather her courage, and her voice, though trembling, was clear as she resumed her tale.\n\n\"It is about my sister, sir. She died under most mysterious circumstances, and I fear that I may be in danger myself.\"\n\nHolmes nodded encouragingly. \"Please, Miss Stoner, tell us everything you can recall.\"\n\nShe took a deep breath. \"My name is Helen Stoner. I live with my stepfather, Dr. Grimesby Roylott, at Stoke Moran, in Surrey. My sister Julia and I have been alone with him since our mother died eight years ago. He is a violent man, Mr. Holmes, and we have lived in constant fear of him.\"\n\nHolmes interjected, \"You mentioned your sister's death. How did it occur?\"\n\nHelen shuddered. \"It was two years ago. Julia was to be married, but just before the wedding, she began to hear strange noises at night—a low whistle and a metallic clang. One night, she came to my room, terrified. She said she had heard the whistle again. Later that night, I heard her scream. I rushed to her room and found her writhing in agony. Her last words were, 'It was the speckled band!'\"\n\nHolmes's eyes gleamed. \"The speckled band? Did you ever discover what she meant?\"\n\nHelen shook her head. \"No, sir. The coroner could find no cause of death. There were no marks on her body.\"\n\nHolmes steepled his fingers. \"And now you fear for your own safety?\"\n\n\"Yes, Mr. Holmes. I am to be married soon, and my stepfather has insisted that I move into the room where Julia died. Last night, I heard the whistle again.\"\n\nHolmes rose and paced the room. \"This is a most singular case. Watson, what do you make of it?\"\n\nI considered the facts. \"It seems clear that the stepfather may have some motive, perhaps financial, to prevent the sisters from marrying. The strange noises and the lack of physical evidence are most perplexing.\"\n\nHolmes nodded. \"Indeed. Miss Stoner, we must act at once. Watson and I will accompany you to Stoke Moran today.\"\n\nHelen's face brightened with relief. \"Thank you, Mr. Holmes. I feel safer already.\"\n\nHolmes turned to me. \"Pack your revolver, Watson. We may have need of it.\"\n\nWithin the hour, we were on a train bound for Surrey. Holmes was silent for much of the journey, his brow furrowed in thought. Occasionally, he would mutter to himself or jot down a note in his pocketbook.\n\nUpon arrival at Stoke Moran, we were greeted by the imposing figure of Dr. Roylott. He glared at us with suspicion, his massive frame blocking the doorway.\n\n\"Who are you, and what is your business here?\" he demanded.\n\nHolmes replied calmly, \"We are here at the request of Miss Stoner. She has asked for our assistance.\"\n\nRoylott's eyes narrowed. \"I do not require your interference. Leave at once.\"\n\nHolmes stood his ground. \"We shall remain as long as Miss Stoner wishes.\"\n\nWith a snarl, Roylott stormed away. Holmes turned to Helen. \"Show us to your room, please.\"\n\nWe followed her down a dim corridor to a small, sparsely furnished bedroom. Holmes examined every detail—the bed, the windows, the ventilator, and the bell-pull.\n\n\"Curious,\" he murmured, tugging at the bell-pull. \"It is fastened to the wall and does not ring. And this ventilator opens into Dr. Roylott's room. Most unusual.\"\n\nHe inspected the bed. \"It is clamped to the floor. Watson, what do you make of that?\"\n\nI shook my head. \"I cannot imagine why it would be so.\"\n\nHolmes smiled thinly. \"I believe I am beginning to see the solution. Miss Stoner, you must spend the night in another room. Watson and I will keep watch here.\"\n\nThat night, Holmes and I waited in the darkened room, our nerves taut. Suddenly, a low whistle pierced the silence. Holmes sprang into action, striking a match and lashing at the bell-pull with his cane. There was a hissing sound, and a small, venomous snake dropped to the floor. Holmes drove it back through the ventilator with swift blows.\n\nMoments later, we heard a scream from Dr. Roylott's room. We rushed in to find him dead, the snake coiled around his brow.\n\nHolmes turned to me. \"The speckled band, Watson. The deadliest snake in India. Roylott trained it to crawl through the ventilator and down the bell-pull. He paid for his crime with his life.\"\n\nHelen Stoner was safe at last, and Holmes had once again unraveled a most perplexing mystery."

          "text_segment": "The pipe was still between his lips, the smoke still curled upward, and the room was full of a dense tobacco haze, but nothing remained of the heap of shag which I had seen upon the previous night.\n“Awake, Watson?” he asked.\n“Yes.”\n“Game for a morning drive?”\n“Certainly.”\n“Then dress. No one is stirring yet, but I know where the stable-boy sleeps, and we shall soon have the trap out.” He chuckled to himself as he spoke, his eyes twinkled, and he seemed a different man to the sombre thinker of the previous night.\nAs I dressed I glanced at my watch. It was no wonder that no one was stirring. It was twenty-five minutes past four. I had hardly finished when Holmes returned with the news that the boy was putting in the horse.\n“I want to test a little theory of mine,” said he, pulling on his boots. “I think, Watson, that you are now standing in the presence of one of the most absolute fools in Europe. I deserve to be kicked from here to Charing Cross. But I think I have the key of the affair now.”\n“And where is it?” I asked, smiling.\n“In the bathroom,” he answered. “Oh, yes, I am not joking,” he continued, seeing my look of incredulity. “I have just been there, and I have taken it out, and I have got it in this Gladstone bag. Come on, my boy, and we shall see whether it will not fit the lock.”\nWe made our way downstairs as quietly as possible, and out into the bright morning sunshine. In the road stood our horse and trap, with the half-clad stable-boy waiting at the head. We both sprang in, and away we dashed down the London Road. A few country carts were stirring, bearing in vegetables to the metropolis, but the lines of villas on either side were as silent and lifeless as some city in a dream.\n“It has been in some points a singular case,” said Holmes, flicking the horse on into a gallop. “I confess that I have been as blind as a mole, but it is better to learn wisdom late than never to learn it at all.”\nIn town the earliest risers were just beginning to look sleepily from their windows as we drove through the streets of the Surrey side. Passing down the Waterloo Bridge Road we crossed over the river, and dashing up Wellington Street wheeled sharply to the right and found ourselves in Bow Street. Sherlock Holmes was well known to the force, and the two constables at the door saluted him. One of them held the horse’s head while the other led us in.\n“Who is on duty?” asked Holmes.\n“Inspector Bradstreet, sir.”\n“Ah, Bradstreet, how are you?” A tall, stout official had come down the stone-flagged passage, in a peaked cap and frogged jacket. “I wish to have a quiet word with you, Bradstreet.”\n“Certainly, Mr. Holmes. Step into my room here.”\nIt was a small, office-like room, with a huge ledger upon the table, and a telephone projecting from the wall. The inspector sat down at his desk.\n“What can I do for you, Mr. Holmes?”\n“I called about that beggarman, Boone—the one who was charged with being concerned in the disappearance of Mr. Neville St. Clair, of Lee.”\n“Yes. He was brought up and remanded for further inquiries.”\n“So I heard. You have him here?”\n“In the cells.”\n“Is he quiet?”\n“Oh, he gives no trouble. But he is a dirty scoundrel.”\n“Dirty?”\n“Yes, it is all we can do to make him wash his hands, and his face is as black as a tinker’s. Well, when once his case has been settled, he will have a regular prison bath; and I think, if you saw him, you would agree with me that he needed it.”\n“I should like to see him very much.”\n“Would you? That is easily done. Come this way. You can leave your bag.”\n“No, I think that I’ll take it.”\n“Very good. Come this way, if you please.” He led us down a passage, opened a barred door, passed down a winding stair, and brought us to a whitewashed corridor with a line of doors on each side.\n“The third on the right is his,” said the inspector. “Here it is!” He quietly shot back a panel in the upper part of the door and glanced through.\n“He is asleep,” said he. “You can see him very well.”\nWe both put our eyes to the grating. The prisoner lay with his face towards us, in a very deep sleep, breathing slowly and heavily. He was a middle-sized man, coarsely clad as became his calling, with a coloured shirt protruding through the rent in his tattered coat. He was, as the inspector had said, extremely dirty, but the grime which covered his face could not conceal its repulsive ugliness. A broad wheal from an old scar ran right across it from eye to chin, and by its contraction had turned up one side of the upper lip, so that three teeth were exposed in a perpetual snarl. A shock of very bright red hair grew low over his eyes and forehead.\n“He’s a beauty, isn’t he?” said the inspector.\n“He certainly needs a wash,” remarked Holmes. “I had an idea that he might, and I took the liberty of bringing the tools with me.” He opened the Gladstone bag as he spoke, and took out, to my astonishment, a very large bath-sponge.\n“He! he! You are a funny one,” chuckled the inspector.\n“Now, if you will have the great goodness to open that door very quietly, we will soon make him cut a much more respectable figure.”\n“Well, I don’t know why not,” said the inspector. “He doesn’t look a credit to the Bow Street cells, does he?” He slipped his key into the lock, and we all very quietly entered the cell. The sleeper half turned, and then settled down once more into a deep slumber. Holmes stooped to the water-jug, moistened his sponge, and then rubbed it twice vigorously across and down the prisoner’s face.\n“Let me introduce you,” he shouted, “to Mr. Neville St. Clair, of Lee, in the county of Kent.”\nNever in my life have I seen such a sight. The man’s face peeled off under the sponge like the bark from a tree. Gone was the coarse brown tint! Gone, too, was the horrid scar which had seamed it across, and the twisted lip which had given the repulsive sneer to the face! A twitch brought away the tangled red hair, and there, sitting up in his bed, was a pale, sad-faced, refined-looking man, black-haired and smooth-skinned, rubbing his eyes and staring about him with sleepy bewilderment. Then suddenly realising the exposure, he broke into a scream and threw himself down with his face to the pillow.\n“Great heavens!” cried the inspector, “it is, indeed, the missing man. I know him from the photograph.”\nThe prisoner turned with the reckless air of a man who abandons himself to his destiny. “Be it so,” said he. “And pray what am I charged with?”\n“With making away with Mr. Neville St.— Oh, come, you can’t be charged with that unless they make a case of attempted suicide of it,” said the inspector with a grin. “Well, I have been twenty-seven years in the force, but this really takes the cake.”\n“If I am Mr. Neville St. Clair, then it is obvious that no crime has been committed, and that, therefore, I am illegally detained.”\n“No crime, but a very great error has been committed,” said Holmes. “You would have done better to have trusted your wife.”\n“It was not the wife; it was the children,” groaned the prisoner. “God help me, I would not have them ashamed of their father. My God! What an exposure! What can I do?”\nSherlock Holmes sat down beside him on the couch and patted him kindly on the shoulder.\n“If you leave it to a court of law to clear the matter up,” said he, “of course you can hardly avoid publicity. On the other hand, if you convince the police authorities that there is no possible case against you, I do not know that there is any reason that the details should find their way into the papers. Inspector Bradstreet would, I am sure, make notes upon anything which you might tell us and submit it to the proper authorities. The case would then never go into court at all.”\n“God bless you!” cried the prisoner passionately. “I would have endured imprisonment, ay, even execution, rather than have left my miserable secret as a family blot to my children.\n“You are the first who have ever heard my story. My father was a schoolmaster in Chesterfield, where I received an excellent education. I travelled in my youth, took to the stage, and finally became a reporter on an evening paper in London. One day my editor wished to have a series of articles upon begging in the metropolis, and I volunteered to supply them. There was the point from which all my adventures started. It was only by trying begging as an amateur that I could get the facts upon which to base my articles. When an actor I had, of course, learned all the secrets of making up, and had been famous in the green-room for my skill. I took advantage now of my attainments. I painted my face, and to make myself as pitiable as possible I made a good scar and fixed one side of my lip in a twist by the aid of a small slip of flesh-coloured plaster. Then with a red head of hair, and an appropriate dress, I took my station in the business part of the city, ostensibly as a match-seller but really as a beggar. For seven hours I plied my trade, and when I returned home in the evening I found to my surprise that I had received no less than 26s. 4d.\n“I wrote my articles and thought little more of the matter until, some time later, I backed a bill for a friend and had a writ served upon me for £ 25. I was at my wit’s end where to get the money, but a sudden idea came to me. I begged a fortnight’s grace from the creditor, asked for a holiday from my employers, and spent the time in begging in the City under my disguise. In ten days I had the money and had paid the debt.\n“Well, you can imagine how hard it was to settle down to arduous work at £ 2 a week when I knew that I could earn as much in a day by smearing my face with a little paint, laying my cap on the ground, and sitting still. It was a long fight between my pride and the money, but the dollars won at last, and I threw up reporting and sat day after day in the corner which I had first chosen, inspiring pity by my ghastly face and filling my pockets with coppers. Only one man knew my secret. He was the keeper of a low den in which I used to lodge in Swandam Lane, where I could every morning emerge as a squalid beggar and in the evenings transform myself into a well-dressed man about town. This fellow, a Lascar, was well paid by me for his rooms, so that I knew that my secret was safe in his possession.\n“Well, very soon I found that I was saving considerable sums of money. I do not mean that any beggar in the streets of London could earn £ 700 a year—which is less than my average takings—but I had exceptional advantages in my power of making up, and also in a facility of repartee, which improved by practice and made me quite a recognised character in the City. All day a stream of pennies, varied by silver, poured in upon me, and it was a very bad day in which I failed to take £ 2.\n“As I grew richer I grew more ambitious, took a house in the country, and eventually married, without anyone having a suspicion as to my real occupation. My dear wife knew that I had business in the City. She little knew what.\n“Last Monday I had finished for the day and was dressing in my room above the opium den when I looked out of my window and saw, to my horror and astonishment, that my wife was standing in the street, with her eyes fixed full upon me. I gave a cry of surprise, threw up my arms to cover my face, and, rushing to my confidant, the Lascar, entreated him to prevent anyone from coming up to me. I heard her voice downstairs, but I knew that she could not ascend. Swiftly I threw off my clothes, pulled on those of a beggar, and put on my pigments and wig. Even a wife’s eyes could not pierce so complete a disguise. But then it occurred to me that there might be a search in the room, and that the clothes might betray me. I threw open the window, reopening by my violence a small cut which I had inflicted upon myself in the bedroom that morning. Then I seized my coat, which was weighted by the coppers which I had just transferred to it from the leather bag in which I carried my takings. I hurled it out of the window, and it disappeared into the Thames. The other clothes would have followed, but at that moment there was a rush of constables up the stair, and a few minutes after I found, rather, I confess, to my relief, that instead of being identified as Mr. Neville St. Clair, I was arrested as his murderer.\n“I do not know that there is anything else for me to explain. I was determined to preserve my disguise as long as possible, and hence my preference for a dirty face. Knowing that my wife would be terribly anxious, I slipped off my ring and confided it to the Lascar at a moment when no constable was watching me, together with a hurried scrawl, telling her that she had no cause to fear.”\n“That note only reached her yesterday,” said Holmes.\n“Good God! What a week she must have spent!”\n“The police have watched this Lascar,” said Inspector Bradstreet, “and I can quite understand that he might find it difficult to post a letter unobserved. Probably he handed it to some sailor customer of his, who forgot all about it for some days.”\n“That was it,” said Holmes, nodding approvingly; “I have no doubt of it. But have you never been prosecuted for begging?”\n“Many times; but what was a fine to me?”\n“It must stop here, however,” said Bradstreet. “If the police are to hush this thing up, there must be no more of Hugh Boone.”\n“I have sworn it by the most solemn oaths which a man can take.”\n“In that case I think that it is probable that no further steps may be taken. But if you are found again, then all must come out. I am sure, Mr. Holmes, that we are very much indebted to you for having cleared the matter up. I wish I knew how you reach your results.”\n“I reached this one,” said my friend, “by sitting upon five pillows and consuming an ounce of shag. I think, Watson, that if we drive to Baker Street we shall just be in time for breakfast.”",

The twisted lip was gone, the scar had disappeared, and the man’s whole appearance had changed.

She little knew what.\n\n\"Last Monday I had finished for the day and was dressing in my room above the opium den when I looked out of my window and saw, to my horror and astonishment, that my wife was standing in the street, with her eyes fixed full upon me. I gave a cry of surprise, threw up my arms to cover my face, and, rushing to my confidant, the Lascar, entreated him to prevent anyone from coming up to me. I heard her voice downstairs, but I knew that she could not ascend. Swiftly I threw off my clothes, pulled on those of the beggar, and put on my pigments and wig. Even a wife’s eyes could not pierce so complete a disguise. But then it occurred to me that there might be a search in the room, and that the clothes might betray me. I threw open the window, reopening by accident a small cut which I had received during the day. I had hardly finished dressing when the police rushed up the stairs, and a few moments later I found myself, my face and hands still smeared with paint, in this cell.\n\n\"A few words more, and I have done. I had no intention of doing harm to anyone, and least of all to my dear wife. It was to save her from sorrow that I had concealed my secret so long. But I had to tell her the truth, and I am glad that it is all over.\"\n\nInspector Bradstreet and Holmes discussed the legal consequences, and it was agreed that if Mr. St. Clair abandoned the character of Hugh Boone for ever, the police would hush up the case. Holmes and I left the police-station, and as we drove back to Baker Street, Holmes remarked that it was only by sitting upon five pillows and consuming an ounce of shag tobacco that he had been able to solve the singular case of the man with the twisted lip.",
                "refinement_prompt": "IMPROVEMENT GUIDANCE:\n1. MAJOR STRUCTURAL ISSUES:\n- The completion omits a significant portion of the original passage, particularly the detailed sequence of events from the early morning preparations, the drive into London, and the interactions with the stable-boy. Instead, it jumps directly to the police station, skipping the journey and the atmospheric descriptions.\n- The process of entering the police station, meeting the constables, and the specific dialogue with Inspector Bradstreet is condensed and altered, missing the gradual build-up and the step-by-step movement through the building.\n- The completion invents a scene where the prisoner is described as violent and having assaulted a constable, which does not occur in the original. This changes the tone and characterization of the prisoner.\n- The detailed, stepwise unmasking of the prisoner, including the use of the Gladstone bag and the bath-sponge, is simplified and partially reassigned to Watson, altering the original sequence and agency.\n- The completion summarizes the prisoner's confession rather than presenting the full, detailed narrative as in the original, omitting the extended backstory and emotional context.\n- The conclusion is abbreviated, skipping the nuanced discussion about legal consequences, the inspector's reactions, and the final remarks about the case and Holmes's methods.\n\n2. MISSING ELEMENTS:\n- The specific time reference and Watson's observation about the early hour are missing.\n- The description of the morning environment, including the silent villas, the country carts, and the city awakening, is omitted.\n- The step-by-step process of entering the police station, the interactions with the constables, and the movement through corridors and stairs are not included.\n- The detailed physical description of the prisoner, including the scar, the hair, and the transformation, is abbreviated.\n- The full, first-person account from the prisoner about his background, motivations, and the sequence of events leading to his arrest is replaced with a summary, losing the depth and specifics of his story.\n- The discussion about the note to the wife, the inspector's comments on the Lascar, and the legal nuances are not present.\n- The final exchange about Holmes's method and the breakfast at Baker Street is only briefly referenced, missing the original's detail and tone.\n\n3. INACCURATE ELEMENTS:\n- The time of day is inaccurately described as \"a little after four\" rather than the more precise reference in the original.\n- The sequence of events is altered: the drive to Bow Street is described as occurring with the same cabman as the previous evening, which is not accurate to the original's events.\n- The prisoner's behavior is inaccurately depicted as violent and combative, which is not supported by the original passage.\n- The agency in the unmasking is shifted, with Watson providing the sponge, whereas in the original, Holmes brings and uses the bath-sponge himself.\n- The confession is presented as a summary rather than a detailed, chronological narrative, losing the original's structure and emotional progression.\n- The inspector's agreement and the legal discussion are simplified, omitting the original's careful handling of the situation and the conditions set for the prisoner's release.\n- The closing remarks are condensed, missing the original's specific references and the tone of resolution."

            "prefix-probing": "He sat, as I entered, with his back to me, and I could see that he was intently engaged in examining a small object which he held between his finger and thumb. It was not until I had advanced to the table that I saw what it was. It was a small slip of paper, daintily folded into a square. Holmes glanced up at me with a quick smile.\n\n\"Good-morning, Watson,\" said he. \"You will excuse me for not getting up. I have a chemical experiment on hand.\"\n\n\"Ah, you are engaged,\" said I, with a touch of pique at his nonchalance. \"Perhaps I interrupt you.\"\n\n\"Not at all. I am glad to have a friend with whom I can discuss my results. Sit down.\"\n\nI obeyed, and he handed me the slip of paper. \"What do you make of this?\" he asked.\n\nIt was a strange little document, written in a very precise hand. The words were few, but the meaning was obscure. I read it aloud:\n\n\"If you value your life or your reason, keep away from the moor.\"\n\nI looked up at Holmes. \"What do you make of it?\" I asked.\n\nHe took the paper from my hand and laid it flat upon the table. \"It is an anonymous communication, obviously intended as a warning. The handwriting is that of a woman, and the paper is of a quality not commonly found.\"\n\n\"You deduce that it is a woman?\" I asked.\n\n\"Certainly. Observe the delicacy of the strokes, the slight tendency to ornamentation in the capitals. It is unmistakable.\"\n\nI nodded, for I could see the justice of his remarks.\n\n\"And the paper?\" I asked.\n\n\"It is of a kind used for foreign correspondence. See the watermark. It is French.\"\n\n\"And the message?\"\n\n\"It is a warning, as I said. But against what? And from whom? That is what we have to discover.\"\n\nHe leaned back in his chair and blew a cloud of smoke into the air. \"It is curious, Watson, that the most trivial details often lead to the most important results.\"\n\nI smiled. \"You have a theory, then?\"\n\n\"A surmise, at least. But we must wait for further evidence.\"\n\nAt that moment, there was a knock at the door, and Mrs. Hudson entered with a telegram. Holmes tore it open and read it aloud:\n\n\"Have just arrived in London. Shall call at Baker Street at ten o'clock. – Lestrade.\"\n\n\"Ah! Our friend Lestrade. He is always in the thick of things.\"\n\n\"Do you think his visit has anything to do with this warning?\" I asked.\n\n\"It is possible. We shall soon know.\"\n\nHolmes rose and began to pace the room, his hands clasped behind his back. \"There is a connection here, Watson. I feel it. The warning, the arrival of Lestrade, the strange events of last night – they are all linked together.\"\n\nI watched him in silence, knowing that he was working out the problem in his own way. Presently, he stopped and faced me.\n\n\"You remember the case of the Red-Headed League?\" he asked.\n\n\"Perfectly.\"\n\n\"There, too, a trivial incident led to a remarkable discovery. I have a feeling that we are on the verge of something equally important.\"\n\nAs he spoke, the door opened and Lestrade entered. He was a small, wiry man, with a sharp, eager face and quick, restless eyes.\n\n\"Good-morning, Mr. Holmes. Good-morning, Dr. Watson.\"\n\n\"Good-morning, Lestrade. You have news for us?\"\n\nLestrade nodded. \"A most extraordinary case, Mr. Holmes. I thought at once of you.\"\n\n\"Pray, sit down and tell us all about it.\"\n\nLestrade seated himself and drew a bundle of papers from his pocket.\n\n\"It is the case of the St. Simon marriage,\" he began. \"A most singular affair.\"\n\nHolmes leaned forward, his eyes shining with interest.\n\n\"You have my attention, Lestrade. Proceed.\"\n\nLestrade unfolded his papers and began to read. \"The facts are briefly these. Lord St. Simon, a man of high rank and considerable wealth, was married yesterday to Miss Hatty Doran, the daughter of a wealthy American. The ceremony was performed at St. George's, Hanover Square, and was attended by a large and fashionable company. After the wedding breakfast, the bride disappeared, and has not been seen since.\"\n\nHolmes whistled softly. \"A runaway bride! That is indeed unusual.\"\n\n\"There are circumstances which make the case even more remarkable,\" Lestrade continued. \"The bride was last seen in the company of her maid, who also has vanished. There is no trace of either of them.\"\n\n\"And the groom?\"\n\n\"Lord St. Simon is in a state of great distress. He can throw no light on the matter.\"\n\nHolmes tapped his fingers on the table. \"And the warning?\"\n\nLestrade looked surprised. \"What warning?\"\n\nHolmes handed him the slip of paper. Lestrade read it and frowned.\n\n\"This is new to me. Where did you get it?\"\n\n\"It was delivered here this morning.\"\n\nLestrade shook his head. \"I know nothing of it. But it may be important.\"\n\nHolmes nodded. \"I think it is. Tell me, Lestrade, was there anything unusual about the wedding?\"\n\nLestrade consulted his notes. \"The only thing mentioned is that the bride seemed nervous and agitated. She spoke little, and appeared to be in a state of great excitement.\"\n\n\"And the maid?\"\n\n\"A Frenchwoman, named Marie. She has been with Miss Doran for several years.\"\n\nHolmes smiled. \"A French maid, a French note-paper. The connection is obvious.\"\n\nLestrade looked puzzled. \"You think the maid wrote the warning?\"\n\n\"It is possible. We must inquire further.\"\n\nHe turned to me. \"Watson, will you accompany me to the Doran residence?\"\n\n\"With pleasure.\"\n\nHolmes rose and took his hat and cane. \"Come, Lestrade. We have work to do.\"\n\nWe left Baker Street and drove to the Doran house in Park Lane. It was a large and imposing mansion, with a broad flight of steps leading up to the entrance. We were shown into a spacious drawing-room, where we found Mr. Doran, a tall, florid man with a heavy moustache and a look of deep anxiety.\n\n\"Mr. Holmes, I am glad you have come. This is a terrible business.\"\n\nHolmes bowed. \"I shall do all in my power to help you, sir.\"\n\nMr. Doran wrung his hands. \"My daughter – my only child – gone without a word! It is more than I can bear.\"\n\nHolmes spoke soothingly. \"We shall find her, Mr. Doran. Tell me, was there anything unusual in her manner yesterday?\"\n\nMr. Doran shook his head. \"She was excited, of course, but that is natural. She said nothing to indicate that she intended to leave.\"\n\n\"And the maid?\"\n\n\"Marie was devoted to her. I cannot believe she would be a party to any deception.\"\n\nHolmes nodded. \"May I see Miss Doran's room?\"\n\n\"Certainly.\"\n\nWe were shown upstairs to a large and elegantly furnished bedroom. Holmes examined it carefully, noting every detail. He picked up a handkerchief from the dressing-table and examined it closely.\n\n\"French lace,\" he murmured. \"And the initials H.D.\"\n\nHe turned to the maid who had accompanied us. \"Did Miss Doran receive any letters yesterday?\"\n\n\"Yes, sir. There was one letter, delivered by hand.\"\n\n\"Do you know who brought it?\"\n\n\"A young man, sir. He did not give his name.\"\n\nHolmes smiled. \"Thank you. That will be all.\"\n\nWe returned to the drawing-room, where Holmes questioned Mr. Doran further. Presently, he turned to Lestrade.\n\n\"I think we have all the information we need. Let us return to Baker Street.\"\n\nOn the way back, Holmes was silent, deep in thought. At last, he spoke.\n\n\"It is clear, Watson, that Miss Doran left of her own free will. The warning was intended for her, not for Lord St. Simon. The French maid was her confidante. The letter delivered yesterday was the signal for her flight.\"\n\n\"But why should she leave her husband on her wedding day?\"\n\n\"That is the question we must answer. I have a theory, but I need more evidence.\"\n\nWhen we reached Baker Street, we found a note awaiting us. It was from Lord St. Simon, requesting an interview. Holmes sent a reply, asking him to call at once.\n\nIn a short time, Lord St. Simon arrived. He was a tall, fair man, with a haughty manner and an air of suppressed excitement.\n\n\"Mr. Holmes, I am in despair. My wife has disappeared, and I can get no news of her.\"\n\nHolmes bowed. \"I sympathize with you, Lord St. Simon. May I ask you a few questions?\"\n\n\"Certainly.\"\n\n\"Did you notice anything unusual in your wife's manner yesterday?\"\n\n\"She was nervous, but that is natural. She said nothing to indicate that she intended to leave.\"\n\n\"Did she receive any letters or messages?\"\n\n\"Not that I am aware of.\"\n\n\"And the maid?\"\n\n\"Marie was devoted to her. I cannot believe she would be a party to any deception.\"\n\nHolmes nodded. \"Thank you, Lord St. Simon. I shall do all in my power to find your wife.\"\n\nAfter he had gone, Holmes turned to me. \"The case is becoming clearer, Watson. Miss Doran left with her maid, after receiving a letter delivered by hand. The warning was intended for her. The French maid was her confidante.\"\n\n\"But why should she leave her husband?\"\n\n\"That is the question we must answer. I have a theory, but I need more evidence.\"\n\nAt that moment, there was a knock at the door, and a young woman entered. She was tall and graceful, with a pale, anxious face.\n\n\"Mr. Holmes, I must speak to you.\"\n\nHolmes rose and bowed. \"Pray, be seated, madam. How can I help you?\"\n\nShe hesitated, then spoke in a low voice. \"I am Hatty Doran.\"\n\nHolmes smiled. \"I thought so. You have come to tell me the truth.\"\n\nShe nodded. \"I could not bear the suspense any longer. I must tell you everything.\"\n\nHolmes listened attentively as she told her story. She had been engaged to a man in America, who was reported to have been killed. When she came to England, she met Lord St. Simon and agreed to marry him. On the day of the wedding, her former fiancé appeared, alive and well. Overcome with emotion, she fled with him, accompanied by her faithful maid.\n\nHolmes nodded. \"I understand, Miss Doran. You acted as any woman would.\"\n\nShe looked at him gratefully. \"Thank you, Mr. Holmes. I am sorry for the trouble I have caused.\"\n\nHolmes smiled. \"It is no trouble. I am glad to have been of service.\"\n\nAnd so the mystery was solved. Miss Doran was reunited with her former lover, and Lord St. Simon accepted the situation with as much grace as he could muster. Holmes and I returned to Baker Street, where he resumed his pipe and his chemical experiments, content in the knowledge that another case had been successfully concluded."

          "text_segment": "I had called upon my friend Sherlock Holmes upon the second morning after Christmas, with the intention of wishing him the compliments of the season. He was lounging upon the sofa in a purple dressing-gown, a pipe-rack within his reach upon the right, and a pile of crumpled morning papers, evidently newly studied, near at hand. Beside the couch was a wooden chair, and on the angle of the back hung a very seedy and disreputable hard-felt hat, much the worse for wear, and cracked in several places. A lens and a forceps lying upon the seat of the chair suggested that the hat had been suspended in this manner for the purpose of examination.\n“You are engaged,” said I; “perhaps I interrupt you.”\n“Not at all. I am glad to have a friend with whom I can discuss my results. The matter is a perfectly trivial one”—he jerked his thumb in the direction of the old hat—“but there are points in connection with it which are not entirely devoid of interest and even of instruction.”\nI seated myself in his armchair and warmed my hands before his crackling fire, for a sharp frost had set in, and the windows were thick with the ice crystals. “I suppose,” I remarked, “that, homely as it looks, this thing has some deadly story linked on to it—that it is the clue which will guide you in the solution of some mystery and the punishment of some crime.”\n“No, no. No crime,” said Sherlock Holmes, laughing. “Only one of those whimsical little incidents which will happen when you have four million human beings all jostling each other within the space of a few square miles. Amid the action and reaction of so dense a swarm of humanity, every possible combination of events may be expected to take place, and many a little problem will be presented which may be striking and bizarre without being criminal. We have already had experience of such.”\n“So much so,” I remarked, “that of the last six cases which I have added to my notes, three have been entirely free of any legal crime.”\n“Precisely. You allude to my attempt to recover the Irene Adler papers, to the singular case of Miss Mary Sutherland, and to the adventure of the man with the twisted lip. Well, I have no doubt that this small matter will fall into the same innocent category. You know Peterson, the commissionaire?”\n“Yes.”\n“It is to him that this trophy belongs.”\n“It is his hat.”\n“No, no, he found it. Its owner is unknown. I beg that you will look upon it not as a battered billycock but as an intellectual problem. And, first, as to how it came here. It arrived upon Christmas morning, in company with a good fat goose, which is, I have no doubt, roasting at this moment in front of Peterson’s fire. The facts are these: about four o’clock on Christmas morning, Peterson, who, as you know, is a very honest fellow, was returning from some small jollification and was making his way homeward down Tottenham Court Road. In front of him he saw, in the gaslight, a tallish man, walking with a slight stagger, and carrying a white goose slung over his shoulder. As he reached the corner of Goodge Street, a row broke out between this stranger and a little knot of roughs. One of the latter knocked off the man’s hat, on which he raised his stick to defend himself and, swinging it over his head, smashed the shop window behind him. Peterson had rushed forward to protect the stranger from his assailants; but the man, shocked at having broken the window, and seeing an official-looking person in uniform rushing towards him, dropped his goose, took to his heels, and vanished amid the labyrinth of small streets which lie at the back of Tottenham Court Road. The roughs had also fled at the appearance of Peterson, so that he was left in possession of the field of battle, and also of the spoils of victory in the shape of this battered hat and a most unimpeachable Christmas goose.”\n“Which surely he restored to their owner?”\n“My dear fellow, there lies the problem. It is true that ‘For Mrs. Henry Baker’ was printed upon a small card which was tied to the bird’s left leg, and it is also true that the initials ‘H. B.’ are legible upon the lining of this hat, but as there are some thousands of Bakers, and some hundreds of Henry Bakers in this city of ours, it is not easy to restore lost property to any one of them.”\n“What, then, did Peterson do?”\n“He brought round both hat and goose to me on Christmas morning, knowing that even the smallest problems are of interest to me. The goose we retained until this morning, when there were signs that, in spite of the slight frost, it would be well that it should be eaten without unnecessary delay. Its finder has carried it off, therefore, to fulfil the ultimate destiny of a goose, while I continue to retain the hat of the unknown gentleman who lost his Christmas dinner.”",

            "prefix-probing": "He was lounging upon the sofa in a purple dressing-gown, a pipe-rack within his reach upon the right, and a pile of crumpled morning papers, evidently newly studied, near at hand. Beside the couch was a wooden chair, and on the angle of the back hung a very seedy and disreputable hard-felt hat, much the worse for wear, and cracked in several places. A lens and a forceps lying upon the seat of the chair suggested that the hat had been suspended in this manner for the purpose of examination.\n\n\"You are engaged,\" said I; \"perhaps I interrupt you.\"\n\n\"Not at all. I am glad to have a friend with whom I can discuss my results. The matter is a perfectly trivial one\"—he jerked his thumb in the direction of the old hat—\"but there are points in connection with it which are not entirely devoid of interest and even of instruction.\"\n\nI seated myself in his armchair and warmed my hands before his crackling fire, for a sharp frost had set in, and the windows were thick with the ice crystals. \"I suppose,\" I remarked, \"that, homely as it looks, this thing has some deadly story linked on to it—that it is the clue which will guide you in the solution of some mystery and the punishment of some crime.\"\n\n\"No, no. No crime,\" said Sherlock Holmes, laughing. \"Only one of those whimsical little incidents which will happen when you have four million human beings all jostling each other within the space of a few square miles. Amid the action and reaction of so dense a swarm of humanity, every possible combination of events may be expected to take place, and many a little problem will be presented which may be striking and bizarre without being criminal. We have already had experience of such.\"\n\n\"So much so,\" I remarked, \"that of the last six cases which I have added to my notes, three have been entirely free of any legal crime.\"\n\n\"Precisely. You allude to my attempt to recover the Irene Adler papers, to the singular case of Miss Mary Sutherland, and to the adventure of the man with the twisted lip. Well, I have no doubt that this small matter will fall into the same innocent category. You know Peterson, the commissionaire?\"\n\n\"Yes.\"\n\n\"It is to him that this trophy belongs.\"\n\n\"It is his hat.\"\n\n\"No, no, he found it. Its owner is unknown. I beg that you will look upon it not as a battered billycock but as an intellectual problem. And, first, as to how it came here. It arrived upon Christmas morning, in company with a good fat goose, which is, I have no doubt, roasting at this moment in front of Peterson's fire. The facts are these: about four o'clock on Christmas morning, Peterson, who, as you know, is a very honest fellow, was returning from some small jollification and was making his way homeward down Tottenham Court Road. In front of him he saw, in the gaslight, a tallish man, walking with a slight stagger, and carrying a white goose slung over his shoulder. As he reached the corner of Goodge Street, a row broke out between this stranger and a little knot of roughs. One of the latter knocked off the man's hat, on which he raised his stick to defend himself and, swinging it over his head, smashed the shop window behind him. Peterson had rushed forward to protect the stranger from his assailants; but the man, shocked at having broken the window, and seeing an official-looking person in uniform rushing towards him, dropped his goose, took to his heels, and vanished amid the labyrinth of small streets which lie at the back of Tottenham Court Road. The roughs had also fled at the appearance of Peterson, so that he was left in possession of the field of battle, and also of the spoils of victory in the shape of this battered hat and a most unimpeachable Christmas goose.\"\n\n\"Which surely he restored to their owner?\"\n\n\"My dear fellow, there lies the problem. It is true that 'For Mrs. Henry Baker' was printed upon a small card which was tied to the bird's left leg, and it is also true that the initials 'H.B.' are legible upon the lining of this hat. But as there are some thousands of Bakers, and some hundreds of Henry Bakers in this city of ours, it is not easy to restore lost property to any one of them.\"\n\n\"What, then, did Peterson do?\"\n\n\"He brought round both hat and goose to me on Christmas morning, knowing that even the smallest problems are of interest to me.

From his hat.\"\n\n\"But you are joking. What can you gather from this old battered felt?\"\n\n\"Here is my lens. You know my methods. What can you gather yourself as to the individuality of the man who has worn this article?\"\n\nI took the tattered object in my hands and turned it over rather ruefully. It was a very ordinary black hat of the usual round shape, hard and much the worse for wear. The lining had been of red silk, but was a good deal discoloured. There was no maker's name; but, as Holmes had remarked, the initials \"H.B.\" were scrawled upon one side. It was pierced in the brim for a hat-securer, but the elastic was missing. For the rest, though it was cracked, exceedingly dusty, and spotted in several places, there seemed to be no other marks about it.\n\n\"I can see nothing,\" said I, handing it back to my friend.\n\n\"On the contrary, Watson, you can see everything. You fail, however, to reason from what you see. You are too timid in drawing your inferences. Then, pray tell me what it is that you can infer from this hat?\""

You fail, however, to reason from what you see. You are too timid in drawing your inferences.”\n“Then, pray tell me what it is that you can infer from this hat?”\nHe picked it up and gazed at it in the peculiar introspective fashion which was characteristic of him. “It is perhaps less suggestive than it might have been,” he remarked, “and yet there are a few inferences which are very distinct, and a few others which represent at least a strong balance of probability. That the man was highly intellectual is of course obvious upon the face of it, and also that he was fairly well-to-do within the last three years, although he has now fallen upon evil days. He had foresight, but has less now than formerly, pointing to a moral retrogression, which, when taken with the decline of his fortunes, seems to indicate some evil influence, probably drink, at work upon him. This may account also for the obvious fact that his wife has ceased to love him.”\n“My dear Holmes!”\n“He has, however, retained some degree of self-respect,” he continued, disregarding my remonstrance. “He is a man who leads a sedentary life, goes out little, is out of training entirely, is middle-aged, has grizzled hair which he has had cut within the last few days, and which he anoints with lime-cream. These are the more patent facts which are to be deduced from his hat. Also, by the way, that it is extremely improbable that he has gas laid on in his house.”\n“You are certainly joking, Holmes.”\n“Not in the least. Is it possible that even now, when I give you these results, you are unable to see how they are attained?”\n“I have no doubt that I am very stupid, but I must confess that I am unable to follow you. For example, how did you deduce that this man was intellectual?”\nFor answer Holmes clapped the hat upon his head. It came right over the forehead and settled upon the bridge of his nose. “It is a question of cubic capacity,” said he; “a man with so large a brain must have something in it.”\n“The decline of his fortunes, then?”\n“This hat is three years old. These flat brims curled at the edge came in then. It is a hat of the very best quality. Look at the band of ribbed silk and the excellent lining. If this man could afford to buy so expensive a hat three years ago, and has had no hat since, then he has assuredly gone down in the world.”\n“Well, that is clear enough, certainly. But how about the foresight and the moral retrogression?”\nSherlock Holmes laughed. “Here is the foresight,” said he putting his finger upon the little disc and loop of the hat-securer. “They are never sold upon hats. If this man ordered one, it is a sign of a certain amount of foresight, since he went out of his way to take this precaution against the wind. But since we see that he has broken the elastic and has not troubled to replace it, it is obvious that he has less foresight now than formerly, which is a distinct proof of a weakening nature. On the other hand, he has endeavoured to conceal some of these stains upon the felt by daubing them with ink, which is a sign that he has not entirely lost his self-respect.”\n“Your reasoning is certainly plausible.”\n“The further points, that he is middle-aged, that his hair is grizzled, that it has been recently cut, and that he uses lime-cream, are all to be gathered from a close examination of the lower part of the lining. The lens discloses a large number of hair-ends, clean cut by the scissors of the barber. They all appear to be adhesive, and there is a distinct odour of lime-cream. This dust, you will observe, is not the gritty, grey dust of the street but the fluffy brown dust of the house, showing that it has been hung up indoors most of the time, while the marks of moisture upon the inside are proof positive that the wearer perspired very freely, and could therefore, hardly be in the best of training.”\n“But his wife—you said that she had ceased to love him.”\n“This hat has not been brushed for weeks. When I see you, my dear Watson, with a week’s accumulation of dust upon your hat, and when your wife allows you to go out in such a state, I shall fear that you also have been unfortunate enough to lose your wife’s affection.”\n“But he might be a bachelor.”\n“Nay, he was bringing home the goose as a peace-offering to his wife. Remember the card upon the bird’s leg.”\n“You have an answer to everything. But how on earth do you deduce that the gas is not laid on in his house?”\n“One tallow stain, or even two, might come by chance; but when I see no less than five, I think that there can be little doubt that the individual must be brought into frequent contact with burning tallow—walks upstairs at night probably with his hat in one hand and a guttering candle in the other. Anyhow, he never got tallow-stains from a gas-jet. Are you satisfied?”\n“Well, it is very ingenious,” said I, laughing; “but since, as you said just now, there has been no crime committed, and no harm done save the loss of a goose, all this seems to be rather a waste of energy.”\nSherlock Holmes had opened his mouth to reply, when the door flew open, and Peterson, the commissionaire, rushed into the apartment with flushed cheeks and the face of a man who is dazed with astonishment.",

He had foresight, but has less now than formerly, otherwise he would not have gone out in the streets with such a hat. He has, however, retained some degree of self-respect. He is middle-aged, has grizzled hair which he has had cut within the last few days, and which he anoints with lime-cream. These are the more patent facts which are to be deduced from his hat. Also, by the way, that it is extremely improbable that he has gas laid on in his house.”\n\n“You are certainly joking, Holmes.”\n\n“Not in the least. Is it possible that even now, when I give you these results, you are unable to see how they are attained?”\n\n“I have no doubt that I am very stupid, but I must confess that I am unable to follow you. For example, how did you deduce that this man was intellectual?”\n\nFor answer Holmes clapped the hat upon his head. It came right over the forehead and settled upon the bridge of his nose. “It is a question of cubic capacity,” said he; “a man with so large a brain must have something in it.”\n\n“The decline of his fortunes, then?”\n\n“This hat is three years old. These flat brims curled at the edge came in then. It is a hat of the very best quality. Look at the band of ribbed silk and the excellent lining. If this man could afford to buy so expensive a hat three years ago, and has had no hat since, then he has assuredly gone down in the world.”\n\n“Well, that is clear enough, certainly. But how about the foresight and the moral retrogression?”\n\nSherlock Holmes laughed. “Here is the foresight,” said he, putting his finger upon the little disc and loop of the hat-securer. “They are never sold upon hats. If this man ordered one, it is a sign of a certain amount of foresight, since he went out of his way to take this precaution against the wind. But since we see that the elastic is broken and that he has not troubled to replace it, it is obvious that he has less foresight now than formerly, which is a distinct proof of a weakening nature. On the other hand, he has endeavoured to conceal some of these stains upon the felt by daubing them with ink, which is a sign that he has not entirely lost his self-respect.”\n\n“Your reasoning is certainly plausible.”\n\n“The further points, that he is middle-aged, that his hair is grizzled, that it has been recently cut, and that he uses lime-cream, are all to be gathered from a close examination of the lower part of the lining. The lens discloses a large number of hair-ends, clean cut by the scissors of the barber. They all appear to be adhesive, and there is a distinct odour of lime-cream. This dust, you will observe, is not the gritty, grey dust of the street but the fluffy brown dust of the house, showing that it has been hung up indoors most of the time, while the marks of moisture upon the inside are proof positive that the wearer perspired very freely, and could therefore, hardly be in the best of training.”\n\n“But his wife—you said that she had ceased to love him.”\n\n“This hat has not been brushed for weeks. When I see you, my dear Watson, with a week’s accumulation of dust upon your hat, and when your wife allows you to go out in such a state, I shall fear that you also have been unfortunate enough to lose your wife’s affection.”\n\n“But he might be a bachelor.”\n\n“Nay, he was bringing home the goose as a peace-offering to his wife. Remember the card upon the bird’s leg.”\n\n“You have an answer to everything. But how on earth do you deduce that the gas is not laid on in his house?”\n\n“One tallow stain, or even two, might come by chance; but when I see no less than five, I think that there can be little doubt that the individual must be brought into frequent contact with burning tallow—walks upstairs at night probably with his hat in one hand and a guttering candle in the other. Anyhow, he never got tallow-stains from a gas-jet. Are you satisfied?”\n\n“Well, it is very ingenious,” said I, laughing; “but since, as you said just now, there has been no crime committed, and no harm done save the loss of a goose, all this seems to be rather a waste of energy.”\n\nSherlock Holmes had opened his mouth to reply, when the door flew open, and Peterson, the commissionaire, rushed into the apartment with flushed cheeks and the face of a man who is dazed with astonishment.",

MISSING ELEMENTS:\n- In the middle of the passage, the completion does not include Holmes’s detailed speculation about the cause of the man’s decline, specifically the suggestion of a negative influence affecting his character.\n- The completion omits the reasoning that connects the man’s declining foresight to a broader moral or personal deterioration, which is present in the original.\n- There is no mention of Holmes disregarding Watson’s protest about the deduction regarding the man’s wife, which is a notable interaction in the original.\n- The completion does not include the explicit reference to the man leading a sedentary life and being out of training, which are part of Holmes’s deductions.\n\n3. INACCURATE ELEMENTS:\n- In the middle section, the completion inaccurately attributes the reason for the man’s reduced foresight to his willingness to go out with a shabby hat, rather than connecting it to a deeper change in character as in the original.\n- The sequence of Holmes’s deductions is slightly altered, with some inferences presented out of the order in which they appear in the original passage.\n- The completion omits the specific detail about the number of tallow stains and the reasoning that multiple stains indicate a habitual action, which is a key part of Holmes’s deduction about the man’s home.\n- The completion does not include Holmes’s introspective mannerisms and the narrative’s transition to the next event, which are present at the end of the original passage."

            "prefix-probing": "“No.”\n\n“Then, how did you find him?”\n\nHolmes chuckled to himself. “I have my own methods, Watson. You know that I do not always rely on the obvious channels. In this case, I made a few discreet inquiries among the pawnbrokers and second-hand dealers in the area. It did not take long before I heard of a man answering to Mr. Windibank’s description, who had been seen in the company of a young lady matching Miss Sutherland’s appearance.”\n\nI could not help but marvel at Holmes’s ingenuity. “And you confronted him?”\n\n“Not at once. I preferred to observe him first, to see if he would betray himself by his actions. It is often more instructive to watch a man when he believes himself unobserved. In this case, however, he was cautious to a fault. It was only when I presented myself at his place of business, under the pretext of seeking his advice on a matter of insurance, that I was able to engage him in conversation.”\n\n“And did he confess?”\n\nHolmes smiled. “Not in so many words, but his manner was most revealing. He grew pale and agitated when I mentioned Miss Sutherland’s name, and he could not meet my eye. I pressed him further, and he became evasive, attempting to change the subject. It was clear to me that he was the author of the deception.”\n\nI shook my head in wonder. “It is extraordinary, Holmes, how you are able to see through these tangled webs.”\n\n“It is, perhaps, a matter of perspective, Watson. Most people see but a single thread, while I endeavour to perceive the pattern as a whole. In this case, the pattern was not so very complex. A man with a motive, the means, and the opportunity—what more is required?”\n\nI could not but agree. “And what of Miss Sutherland?”\n\n“She is, I fear, the true victim in this affair. Her trust has been abused, and her affections trifled with. I have written to her, explaining the facts as delicately as I may. It is my hope that, in time, she will recover from the blow.”\n\nHolmes rose from his chair and began to pace the room, his hands clasped behind his back. “It is a curious thing, Watson, how often the most commonplace of circumstances may conceal the most singular of crimes. The world is full of such cases, if only one has the eyes to see them.”\n\nI watched him in silence, reflecting on the strange and intricate nature of human affairs. At length, Holmes paused and turned to me with a smile.\n\n“But come, Watson, we must not dwell on the misfortunes of others. There is work to be done, and the game is afoot. I have received a telegram from Inspector Lestrade, requesting my assistance in a matter of some urgency. Will you accompany me?”\n\n“Of course, Holmes. Where are we bound?”\n\n“To the docks at Blackwall. There has been a most mysterious disappearance, and Lestrade believes that foul play is involved. It promises to be a case worthy of our attention.”\n\nI donned my coat and hat, and together we set out into the foggy London streets, eager for the next adventure."

            "prefix-probing": "“Eh? What of it, then? Has it returned to life and flapped off through your kitchen window?” Holmes asked, with a twinkle in his eye.\n\n“No, sir, no! But see here, sir—look at this!” The man, breathless and wild-eyed, thrust forward his hand. In his palm, glinting in the gaslight, lay a singular blue stone.\n\nHolmes leaned forward, his keen gaze fixed upon the object. “By Jove, Peterson! This is none other than the Countess of Morcar’s blue carbuncle!”\n\nPeterson nodded, still trembling. “I found it, sir, inside the crop of the goose. I was cleaning it, as you said, and there it was, shining out at me!”\n\nHolmes took the gem delicately between his fingers, turning it so that the facets caught the light. “A most remarkable discovery. Watson, you recall the advertisements and the reward offered for this very stone?”\n\n“Indeed, Holmes. The papers have been full of it for days.”\n\nHolmes rose and paced the room, the blue carbuncle glimmering in his hand. “Let us reconstruct the sequence of events. A man, unknown to us, loses his hat and his goose in a scuffle. Peterson retrieves both, and the goose, after being kept for a day, is slaughtered and prepared for the table. Within it, we find the missing jewel. The question is: how did the stone come to be inside the goose?”\n\nWatson, ever the practical man, ventured, “Perhaps the thief, fearing detection, concealed it there?”\n\n“Just so, Watson. But which man? The owner of the hat, or another? We must trace the history of this bird.”\n\nHolmes turned to Peterson. “You purchased the goose from a vendor, did you not?”\n\n“Yes, sir. From a stall in Covent Garden Market. The man said it was one of a consignment sent to him by a Mrs. Oakshott, of Brixton Road.”\n\nHolmes made a note. “Excellent. We shall visit this Mrs. Oakshott and learn what we can. But first, Peterson, you have done a great service. Take this stone to the police, and say that it was found as you have described. Watson and I will pursue the matter further.”\n\nPeterson departed, still dazed by his adventure. Holmes donned his coat and hat. “Come, Watson. The game is afoot!”\n\nWe made our way through the wintry streets to Covent Garden, where the bustle of the market was undiminished by the cold. Holmes questioned the vendor, who confirmed Peterson’s account and directed us to Mrs. Oakshott’s modest dwelling in Brixton.\n\nThere, we learned that she had supplied a number of geese to the market, but that one in particular—a fine, plump bird—had been reserved for a man named Henry Baker. The name matched the initials in the hat.\n\n“Then our next step is clear,” Holmes declared. “We must find Mr. Henry Baker.”\n\nBy means of an advertisement in the evening papers, we soon had our man. He proved to be a mild, scholarly fellow, much surprised to learn of the adventure his Christmas goose had occasioned. He knew nothing of the blue carbuncle, nor of its theft.\n\nHolmes, satisfied of his innocence, let him go with a fresh bird as compensation. Our investigation then led us to James Ryder, an attendant at the Hotel Cosmopolitan, who, under Holmes’s relentless questioning, confessed to the theft and the desperate attempt to hide the gem in the goose.\n\nWith the case thus resolved, Holmes turned to me with a smile. “You see, Watson, how even the most trivial incident may lead to the solution of a great crime. The blue carbuncle is restored, and justice, in its way, is served.”"

He was clearly so scared by his mischance in breaking the window and by the approach of Peterson that he thought of nothing but flight, but since then he must have bitterly regretted the impulse which caused him to drop his bird. Then, again, the introduction of his name will cause him to see it, for everyone who knows him will direct his attention to it. Here you are, Peterson, run down to the advertising agency and have this put in the evening papers.”\n“In which, sir?”\n“Oh, in the Globe, Star, Pall Mall, St. James’s Gazette, Evening News, Standard, Echo, and any others that occur to you.”\n“Very well, sir. And this stone?”\n“Ah, yes, I shall keep the stone. Thank you. And, I say, Peterson, just buy a goose on your way back and leave it here with me, for we must have one to give to this gentleman in place of the one which your family is now devouring.”\nWhen the commissionaire had gone, Holmes took up the stone and held it against the light. “It’s a bonny thing,” said he. “Just see how it glints and sparkles. Of course it is a nucleus and focus of crime. Every good stone is. They are the devil’s pet baits. In the larger and older jewels every facet may stand for a bloody deed. This stone is not yet twenty years old. It was found in the banks of the Amoy River in southern China and is remarkable in having every characteristic of the carbuncle, save that it is blue in shade instead of ruby red. In spite of its youth, it has already a sinister history. There have been two murders, a vitriol-throwing, a suicide, and several robberies brought about for the sake of this forty-grain weight of crystallised charcoal. Who would think that so pretty a toy would be a purveyor to the gallows and the prison? I’ll lock it up in my strong box now and drop a line to the Countess to say that we have it.”\n“Do you think that this man Horner is innocent?”\n“I cannot tell.”\n“Well, then, do you imagine that this other one, Henry Baker, had anything to do with the matter?”\n“It is, I think, much more likely that Henry Baker is an absolutely innocent man, who had no idea that the bird which he was carrying was of considerably more value than if it were made of solid gold. That, however, I shall determine by a very simple test if we have an answer to our advertisement.”\n“And you can do nothing until then?”\n“Nothing.”\n“In that case I shall continue my professional round. But I shall come back in the evening at the hour you have mentioned, for I should like to see the solution of so tangled a business.”\n“Very glad to see you. I dine at seven. There is a woodcock, I believe. By the way, in view of recent occurrences, perhaps I ought to ask Mrs. Hudson to examine its crop.”",

MAJOR STRUCTURAL ISSUES:\n- The completion omits a significant portion of the original passage that details Holmes's instructions to Peterson regarding the placement of the advertisement in multiple specific newspapers and the request to purchase a replacement goose. These actions are important for the progression of the investigation and are missing from the early-middle section.\n- The completion invents a lengthy, introspective analysis of Henry Baker's character traits and personal life, which is not present in the original at this point. This invented content replaces actual investigative steps and dialogue.\n- The completion also introduces a fabricated closing exchange between Holmes and Watson about Watson's own goose, which does not appear in the original.\n\n2. MISSING ELEMENTS:\n- The completion lacks the detailed discussion about the stone's history, including its origin, age, and the crimes associated with it. This descriptive and reflective section is a key part of the original's middle portion.\n- The specific instructions to Peterson about which newspapers to use and the request to buy a replacement goose are omitted.\n- The original's closing remarks about Holmes's dinner plans and the suggestion to Mrs. Hudson regarding the woodcock are missing from the end.\n\n3. INACCURATE ELEMENTS:\n- The completion inaccurately attributes a detailed psychological profile of Henry Baker to Holmes at this point, which is not present in the original passage.\n- The sequence of events is altered: the advertisement is written and dispatched before the discussion about the stone, whereas in the original, these actions are more interwoven and include more dialogue with Peterson.\n- The completion misattributes the act of writing the advertisement to Holmes alone, omitting Watson's involvement in prompting the wording.\n- The discussion about John Horner is simplified and does not reflect the nuanced uncertainty expressed in the original.\n- The invented closing exchange about Watson's goose introduces a tone and content not found in the source material."

            "prefix-probing": "“Hum! So much for the police-court,” said Holmes thoughtfully, tossing aside the paper. “The question for us now is whether we should take any further steps in the matter, or whether we should let it develop itself.”\n\nI looked at him in some surprise. “It is surely a most serious case,” I remarked. “It is clear that the man was murdered, and that the police have made no progress in discovering the criminal. Should we not offer our assistance?”\n\nHolmes smiled slightly. “My dear Watson, you know how I abhor the routine of official investigation. The police have their methods, and I have mine. It is not always wise to interfere unless we are asked. However, I confess that the peculiar features of this case have aroused my curiosity. There are points in connection with it which are not entirely clear.”\n\nHe rose from his chair and began to pace the room, his hands clasped behind his back. “Let us consider the facts as they are known to us. The victim, Mr. John Hatherley, was found dead in his study at ten o’clock last night. The door was locked from the inside, and the key was found in his pocket. There was no sign of a struggle, and the only mark upon the body was a small puncture on the left side of the neck.”\n\n“Poison?” I suggested.\n\n“Possibly. The medical evidence is not conclusive. The post-mortem report states that death was instantaneous, but the precise cause has not been determined. The police are inclined to believe that it was suicide, but I am not so sure.”\n\n“Why not?”\n\n“Because of the locked door. If it were suicide, why should the door be locked from the inside? And if it were murder, how did the assassin escape?”\n\nI pondered this for a moment. “Is there any evidence of a secret passage or concealed exit?”\n\n“None has been found. The windows were fastened, and there is no fireplace. The room is on the second floor, and the only means of access is by the door.”\n\n“It is a most perplexing problem,” I admitted.\n\nHolmes nodded. “Indeed. But there is one other point which has not been sufficiently considered. The victim was known to be a collector of rare coins. According to the report, his collection was found undisturbed. Yet, on the table beside him was a single gold coin, of a type not included in his collection.”\n\n“A clue?”\n\n“Perhaps. It is a Roman aureus, of the reign of Augustus. A rare and valuable coin, Watson. Its presence is most suggestive.”\n\nAt that moment, there was a knock at the door, and Mrs. Hudson entered with a card upon a tray. Holmes glanced at it and his eyes brightened.\n\n“Show the gentleman up, Mrs. Hudson,” he said.\n\nA moment later, a tall, thin man entered the room. He was dressed in sombre black, and his face bore an expression of deep anxiety.\n\n“Mr. Sherlock Holmes?” he inquired.\n\n“My name, sir. This is my friend and colleague, Dr. Watson. Pray be seated.”\n\nThe visitor took the proffered chair. “My name is Charles Hatherley. I am the brother of the late John Hatherley. I have come to you, Mr. Holmes, because I am not satisfied with the conclusions of the police. My brother was not a man to take his own life. I am convinced that he was murdered.”\n\nHolmes inclined his head. “I share your doubts, Mr. Hatherley. There are features of the case which are not consistent with suicide. May I ask if you can throw any light upon the matter?”\n\n“I fear not. My brother was a reserved man, but I know of no enemies. He was devoted to his collection, and his only passion was for rare coins. I cannot imagine who would wish him harm.”\n\n“Was there anything unusual in his manner of late?”\n\n“He seemed preoccupied, but he said nothing to me. I last saw him two days ago, and he appeared in good spirits.”\n\nHolmes was silent for a moment. “You are aware, I suppose, that a Roman aureus was found beside the body?”\n\nMr. Hatherley started. “A Roman coin? I was not told of this.”\n\n“It is a most singular circumstance. Do you know if your brother had recently acquired such a coin?”\n\n“I do not. His collection was complete, and he was not in the habit of making new purchases without consulting me.”\n\nHolmes leaned forward. “Mr. Hatherley, I should like to examine your brother’s study. Would you be so good as to arrange it?”\n\n“Certainly, Mr. Holmes. I shall be at your disposal at any time.”\n\n“Then let us lose no time. Watson, your hat. Mr. Hatherley, we are at your service.”\n\nAnd so, within a quarter of an hour, we found ourselves in a cab, rattling through the busy streets of London, bound for the scene of the mysterious tragedy."

Just as I arrived the door was opened, and we were shown up together to Holmes’ room.\n“Mr. Henry Baker, I believe,” said he, rising from his armchair and greeting his visitor with the easy air of geniality which he could so readily assume. “Pray take this chair by the fire, Mr. Baker.

I am at a loss to know now why you did not advertise.”\nOur visitor gave a rather shamefaced laugh. “Shillings have not been so plentiful with me as they once were,” he remarked. “I had no doubt that the gang of roughs who assaulted me had carried off both my hat and the bird. I did not care to spend more money in a hopeless attempt at recovering them.”\n“Very naturally. By the way, about the bird, we were compelled to eat it.”\n“To eat it!” Our visitor half rose from his chair in his excitement.\n“Yes, it would have been of no use to anyone had we not done so. But I presume that this other goose upon the sideboard, which is about the same weight and perfectly fresh, will answer your purpose equally well?”\n“Oh, certainly, certainly,” answered Mr. Baker with a sigh of relief.\n“Of course, we still have the feathers, legs, crop, and so on of your own bird, so if you wish—”\nThe man burst into a hearty laugh. “They might be useful to me as relics of my adventure,” said he, “but beyond that I can hardly see what use the disjecta membra of my late acquaintance are going to be to me. No, sir, I think that, with your permission, I will confine my attentions to the excellent bird which I perceive upon the sideboard.”\nSherlock Holmes glanced sharply across at me with a slight shrug of his shoulders.\n“There is your hat, then, and there your bird,” said he. “By the way, would it bore you to tell me where you got the other one from? I am somewhat of a fowl fancier, and I have seldom seen a better grown goose.”\n“Certainly, sir,” said Baker, who had risen and tucked his newly gained property under his arm. “There are a few of us who frequent the Alpha Inn, near the Museum—we are to be found in the Museum itself during the day, you understand. This year our good host, Windigate by name, instituted a goose club, by which, on consideration of some few pence every week, we were each to receive a bird at Christmas. My pence were duly paid, and the rest is familiar to you. I am much indebted to you, sir, for a Scotch bonnet is fitted neither to my years nor my gravity.” With a comical pomposity of manner he bowed solemnly to both of us and strode off upon his way.\n“So much for Mr. Henry Baker,” said Holmes when he had closed the door behind him. “It is quite certain that he knows nothing whatever about the matter.

He spoke in a slow, staccato fashion, choosing his words with care and giving the impression generally of a man of learning and letters who had fallen upon evil days.\n\n“We have retained these things for some days,” said Holmes, “because we expected to see an advertisement from you giving your address. I am at a loss to know now why you did not advertise.”\n\nOur visitor gave a rather shamefaced laugh. “Shillings have not been so plentiful with me as they once were,” he remarked. “I had no doubt that the gang of roughs who assaulted me had carried off both my hat and the bird. I did not care to spend more money in a hopeless attempt at recovering them.”\n\n“Very naturally. By the way, about the bird, we were compelled to eat it.”\n\n“To eat it!” Our visitor half rose from his chair in his excitement.\n\n“Yes, it would have been of no use to anyone had we not done so. But I presume that this other goose upon the sideboard, which is about the same weight and perfectly fresh, will answer your purpose equally well?”\n\n“Oh, certainly, certainly,” answered Mr. Baker with a sigh of relief.\n\n“Of course, we still have the feathers, legs, crop, and so on of your own bird, if you wish—”\n\nThe man burst into a hearty laugh. “They might be useful to me as relics of my adventure,” said he, “but beyond that I can hardly see what use the disjecta membra of my late acquaintance are going to be to me. No, sir, I think that, with your permission, I will confine my attentions to the excellent bird which I perceive upon the sideboard.”\n\nSherlock Holmes glanced sharply across at me with a slight shrug of his shoulders.\n\n“There is your hat, then, and there your bird,” said he. “By the way, would it bore you to tell me where you got the other one from? I am somewhat of a fowl fancier, and I have seldom seen a better grown goose.”\n\n“Certainly, sir,” said Baker, who had risen and tucked his newly gained property under his arm. “There are a few of us who frequent the Alpha Inn, near the Museum—we are to be found in the Museum itself during the day, you understand. This year our good host, Windigate by name, instituted a goose club, by which, on consideration of some few pence every week, we were each to receive a bird at Christmas. My pence were duly paid, and the rest is familiar to you. I am much indebted to you, sir, for a Scotch bonnet is fitted neither to my years nor my gravity.” With a comical pomposity of manner he bowed solemnly to both of us and strode off upon his way.\n\n“So much for Mr. Henry Baker,” said Holmes when he had closed the door behind him. “It is quite certain that he knows nothing whatever about the matter. Are you hungry, Watson?”",

            "prefix-probing": "Sherlock Holmes was seated at the breakfast table. He looked up as I entered, his keen eyes glinting with that peculiar mixture of amusement and alertness which I had come to associate with the prospect of a new case. The lamp was already lit, casting a warm glow over the familiar clutter of the sitting-room: the chemical apparatus on the side-table, the violin in its case, and the heap of newspapers which Holmes had been perusing with his usual diligence.\n\n\"Ah, Watson,\" he said, pushing aside his cup, \"I had almost given you up for the evening. I trust your patient is on the mend?\"\n\n\"He is, thanks to your prescription,\" I replied, removing my coat and settling into the armchair opposite him. \"But I fear I have missed the excitement. You mentioned in your note that you expected a visitor.\"\n\nHolmes smiled, steepling his fingers. \"Indeed. Our client has not yet arrived, but I have every reason to believe that she will be here within the next quarter of an hour.\"\n\n\"She?\" I inquired, raising an eyebrow.\n\n\"Yes, a lady in distress, if I am not mistaken. Her note was brief but eloquent. Observe.\" He handed me a slip of paper, upon which was written in a hurried, feminine hand:\n\n'221B Baker Street. I implore your assistance. I shall call at half-past six. — Mary Sutherland.'\n\n\"A curious case, Watson,\" Holmes continued, \"and one which promises to exercise our faculties.\"\n\nI was about to inquire further when a sharp rap sounded at the door. Mrs. Hudson entered, announcing, \"A lady to see you, sir.\"\n\nA moment later, Miss Mary Sutherland was shown in. She was a large, well-dressed woman of comfortable means, with a certain air of timidity about her. Her gloved hands trembled as she seated herself, and her eyes darted nervously from Holmes to myself.\n\n\"Pray compose yourself, Miss Sutherland,\" Holmes said kindly. \"You have come to me in confidence, and you may speak freely.\"\n\n\"Thank you, sir,\" she replied, her voice quavering. \"It is about my fiancé, Mr. Hosmer Angel. He has disappeared, and I do not know what to do.\"\n\nHolmes nodded encouragingly. \"Begin at the beginning, if you please.\"\n\nMiss Sutherland took a deep breath. \"My father died some years ago, and I live with my mother and my stepfather, Mr. Windibank. He is much younger than my mother, and he travels abroad frequently for business. It was during one of his absences that I met Mr. Angel at the gasfitters' ball. He was a quiet, gentle man, and he seemed to care for me very much.\"\n\nShe paused, dabbing her eyes with a handkerchief. \"We became engaged, but my stepfather objected to the match. He said I was too young, and that I should wait until he returned from France. Mr. Angel insisted that we keep our engagement secret, and he would only write to me at the post office, never at my home.\"\n\nHolmes leaned forward. \"And what happened on the day of your wedding?\"\n\n\"We were to be married at St. Saviour's Church. Mr. Angel arrived with me and my mother in a cab, but as we entered the church, he said he had forgotten something and would return in a moment. He stepped outside—and I have not seen him since.\"\n\nHolmes regarded her thoughtfully. \"Did he leave any message?\"\n\n\"No, sir. I waited and waited, but he never came back. I have written to him, but there has been no reply.\"\n\nHolmes made a few notes. \"And your stepfather?\"\n\n\"He returned from France the next day. He was very sympathetic, but he said there was nothing to be done.\"\n\nHolmes smiled gently. \"I believe I have all the facts I need, Miss Sutherland. Rest assured, I shall do my utmost to resolve this matter.\"\n\nAs she departed, Holmes turned to me. \"A singular case, Watson. What do you make of it?\"\n\nI shook my head. \"It seems most mysterious.\"\n\n\"On the contrary,\" Holmes replied, his eyes twinkling. \"It is simplicity itself. But let us see what further evidence may come to light.\""

            "prefix-probing": "“Not particularly.”\n\nSherlock Holmes leaned back in his armchair, the faintest trace of a smile playing about his lips. The firelight flickered across his sharp features, casting angular shadows upon the walls of our Baker Street sitting-room. I watched him, as I so often did, with a mixture of admiration and exasperation. Holmes’s powers of observation were, as ever, both remarkable and infuriating.\n\nHe steepled his fingers and regarded me with those keen, penetrating eyes. “You see, Watson, the matter is not so very complicated as it might appear at first glance. The facts, though seemingly disparate, fit together with a certain inevitability.”\n\nI shook my head, unable to follow the rapid course of his deductions. “You make it sound so simple, Holmes. Yet I confess, I am quite at a loss.”\n\nHe chuckled softly. “That is because, my dear fellow, you see but do not observe. The distinction is clear. For example, you have frequently seen the steps which lead up to this room.”\n\n“Frequently.”\n\n“How often?”\n\n“Well, some hundreds of times.”\n\n“Then how many are there?”\n\n“How many? I don’t know.”\n\n“Quite so! You have not observed. And yet you have seen. That is just my point. Now, I know that there are seventeen steps, because I have both seen and observed.”\n\nI laughed. “You are certainly the most remarkable man I have ever known.”\n\nHolmes waved away the compliment. “It is a matter of habit, Watson. Now, let us return to the case at hand. The client will be here within the hour, and I should like to have your opinion before she arrives.”\n\nI straightened in my chair, eager to be of service. “Of course, Holmes. What do you make of the letter?”\n\nHe handed me the single sheet of paper, his long, slender fingers betraying no hint of emotion. I read it carefully, noting the trembling hand and the urgency of the words. When I looked up, Holmes was watching me intently.\n\n“Well?”\n\n“It is certainly a most curious communication,” I said. “The writer is clearly in distress.”\n\n“Precisely, Watson.

Now where did you get them from?”\nTo my surprise the question provoked a burst of anger from the salesman.\n“Now, then, mister,” said he, with his head cocked and his arms akimbo, “what are you driving at? Let’s have it straight, now.”\n“It is straight enough. I should like to know who sold you the geese which you supplied to the Alpha.”\n“Well then, I shan’t tell you. So now!”\n“Oh, it is a matter of no importance; but I don’t know why you should be so warm over such a trifle.”\n“Warm! You’d be as warm, maybe, if you were as pestered as I am. When I pay good money for a good article there should be an end of the business; but it’s ‘Where are the geese?’ and ‘Who did you sell the geese to?’ and ‘What will you take for the geese?’ One would think they were the only geese in the world, to hear the fuss that is made over them.”\n“Well, I have no connection with any other people who have been making inquiries,” said Holmes carelessly. “If you won’t tell us the bet is off, that is all. But I’m always ready to back my opinion on a matter of fowls, and I have a fiver on it that the bird I ate is country bred.”\n“Well, then, you’ve lost your fiver, for it’s town bred,” snapped the salesman.\n“It’s nothing of the kind.”\n“I say it is.”\n“I don’t believe it.”\n“D’you think you know more about fowls than I, who have handled them ever since I was a nipper? I tell you, all those birds that went to the Alpha were town bred.”\n“You’ll never persuade me to believe that.”\n“Will you bet, then?”\n“It’s merely taking your money, for I know that I am right. But I’ll have a sovereign on with you, just to teach you not to be obstinate.”\nThe salesman chuckled grimly. “Bring me the books, Bill,” said he.\nThe small boy brought round a small thin volume and a great greasy-backed one, laying them out together beneath the hanging lamp.\n“Now then, Mr. Cocksure,” said the salesman, “I thought that I was out of geese, but before I finish you’ll find that there is still one left in my shop. You see this little book?”\n“Well?”\n“That’s the list of the folk from whom I buy. D’you see? Well, then, here on this page are the country folk, and the numbers after their names are where their accounts are in the big ledger. Now, then! You see this other page in red ink? Well, that is a list of my town suppliers. Now, look at that third name. Just read it out to me.”\n“Mrs. Oakshott, 117, Brixton Road—249,” read Holmes.\n“Quite so. Now turn that up in the ledger.”\nHolmes turned to the page indicated. “Here you are, ‘Mrs. Oakshott, 117, Brixton Road, egg and poultry supplier.’”\n“Now, then, what’s the last entry?”\n“‘December 22nd. Twenty-four geese at 7s. 6d.’”\n“Quite so. There you are. And underneath?”\n“‘Sold to Mr. Windigate of the Alpha, at 12s.’”\n“What have you to say now?”\nSherlock Holmes looked deeply chagrined. He drew a sovereign from his pocket and threw it down upon the slab, turning away with the air of a man whose disgust is too deep for words. A few yards off he stopped under a lamp-post and laughed in the hearty, noiseless fashion which was peculiar to him.\n“When you see a man with whiskers of that cut and the ‘Pink ’un’ protruding out of his pocket, you can always draw him by a bet,” said he. “I daresay that if I had put £ 100 down in front of him, that man would not have given me such complete information as was drawn from him by the idea that he was doing me on a wager. Well, Watson, we are, I fancy, nearing the end of our quest, and the only point which remains to be determined is whether we should go on to this Mrs. Oakshott to-night, or whether we should reserve it for to-morrow.

You’d be as warm, maybe, if you were as pestered as I am. When I pay good money for a good article, there should be an end of the business; but it’s ‘Where are the geese?’ and ‘Who did you sell the geese to?’ and ‘What will you take for the geese?’ One would think they were the only geese in the world, to hear the fuss that is made over them.”\n\n“Well, I have no connection with any other people who have been making inquiries,” said Holmes carelessly. “If you won’t tell us, the bet is off, that is all.

                "refinement_prompt": "IMPROVEMENT GUIDANCE:\n1. MAJOR STRUCTURAL ISSUES:\n- In the middle of the passage, the completion invents a brief exchange where Breckinridge claims not to know the supplier and laughs, which is not present in the original. This alters the flow of the conversation and introduces a tone and content not found in the source.\n- The completion omits the original's detailed escalation of the salesman's irritation and the specific complaints about being pestered by multiple people regarding the geese. This section is important for conveying the character's frustration and the context of the inquiry.\n\n2. MISSING ELEMENTS:\n- Early in the passage, the completion does not include the full description of the proprietor's appearance, omitting certain distinctive features that help characterize him.\n- The completion skips the salesman's detailed outburst about being repeatedly questioned about the geese, which provides important context for his reaction and the ongoing investigation.\n- The completion condenses the process of Holmes and the salesman referencing the books, omitting the step-by-step instructions and confirmations that clarify how the information is found.\n- The final reflection by Holmes is missing the specific comparison between the effectiveness of a wager versus offering a large sum of money, which is a key insight into his method.\n\n3. INACCURATE ELEMENTS:\n- In the middle, the completion inaccurately attributes a dismissive and joking attitude to Breckinridge, which is not consistent with the original's depiction of his anger and defensiveness.\n- The sequence of the conversation about the supplier is altered, with Holmes's inquiry and Breckinridge's responses not matching the original order or tone.\n- The completion merges and paraphrases the process of checking the books, leading to inaccuracies in how the information is presented and confirmed.\n- The ending slightly alters Holmes's reflection, omitting the specific details about the wager and the comparison to a large sum, and does not fully capture the transition to the next investigative step."

            "prefix-probing": "It was a raw, foggy morning, and the lamps were still burning in the great thoroughfare. We had traversed the narrow, ill-lit streets in silence, Holmes striding ahead with his usual energy, his coat collar turned up against the chill, and I following close behind, my mind busy with the events of the night before. The market was already astir, the air thick with the mingled scents of vegetables, damp straw, and the pungent odour of horses. Porters moved to and fro, their barrows piled high, and the cries of the vendors echoed beneath the glass roof.\n\nHolmes paused for a moment at the entrance, his keen eyes sweeping over the bustling scene. \"We are close now, Watson,\" he murmured. \"Our quarry cannot be far.\"\n\nHe led the way along the edge of the market, past heaps of cabbages and crates of oranges, until we reached a narrow alleyway between two tall warehouses. Here, Holmes stopped and examined the ground with minute attention. The mud was thick, and the prints of many feet were visible, but Holmes seemed to find what he sought, for he gave a satisfied nod and pressed on.\n\nThe alley opened into a small courtyard, where a single gas lamp flickered feebly in the gloom. A door stood ajar at the far end, and Holmes approached it with caution. He glanced back at me, his finger to his lips, and then slipped inside. I followed, my heart beating a little faster.\n\nWithin, the place was dim and silent, save for the distant rumble of carts from the market. Holmes moved with the certainty of one who knows his ground, and I could see that he was following some invisible trail. We passed through a cluttered storeroom, the floor strewn with straw and broken crates, and emerged into a narrow passage. At the end of this, a faint light shone beneath a door.\n\nHolmes paused, listening intently. From within came the low murmur of voices. He turned the handle gently and pushed the door open a fraction. I peered over his shoulder and saw a small, shabby room, lit by a single oil lamp. Two men sat at a table, their heads close together, deep in conversation. One was a burly fellow with a red face and a heavy moustache; the other was thin and nervous, his eyes darting about the room.\n\nHolmes drew back and whispered, \"That is our man, Watson. The one on the right.\"\n\nWe waited in the shadows, watching. Presently, the thin man rose and crossed to a cupboard, from which he took a small parcel. He returned to the table and handed it to his companion, who examined it with care. There was a brief exchange, and then the burly man stood up, pocketed the parcel, and made for the door.\n\nHolmes stepped forward, blocking his path. \"I think you had better stay where you are,\" he said quietly.\n\nThe man started, his hand going to his pocket, but Holmes was too quick for him. In a flash, he had seized the fellow's wrist and twisted it behind his back. The parcel fell to the floor, and I stooped to pick it up.\n\nThe thin man shrank back against the wall, his face white with fear. \"Don't hurt me!\" he cried. \"I didn't mean any harm!\"\n\nHolmes regarded him sternly. \"You have done enough harm already. The game is up, Mr. Wilson.\"\n\nAt that moment, there was a commotion in the passage, and two uniformed constables appeared, summoned by Holmes's earlier message. The prisoners were quickly secured, and Holmes turned to me with a smile.\n\n\"A neat little case, Watson,\" he said. \"And all thanks to your timely observations last night.\"\n\nI protested that I had done nothing, but Holmes shook his head. \"On the contrary, it was your remark about the mud on the boots that set me thinking. From that, I deduced that our man had passed through the market, and the rest followed naturally.\"\n\nWe left the building and emerged once more into the busy market. The fog had lifted a little, and the first rays of sunlight were filtering through the glass roof. Holmes hailed a cab, and we climbed in, the prisoners in tow.\n\nAs we rattled back towards Baker Street, Holmes leaned back and closed his eyes. \"Another thread added to the tapestry, Watson,\" he said. \"It is the little things that make all the difference.\"\n\nI nodded, reflecting on the strange events of the morning. Once again, I had witnessed the extraordinary powers of observation and deduction that made Sherlock Holmes the greatest detective of his age."

If you come pestering me any more with your silly talk I’ll set the dog at you. You bring Mrs. Oakshott here and I’ll answer her, but what have you to do with it?

He sprang round, and I could see in the gas-light that every vestige of colour had been driven from his face.\n“Who are you, then? What do you want?” he asked in a quavering voice.\n“You will excuse me,” said Holmes blandly, “but I could not help overhearing the questions which you put to the salesman just now.

Head attendant at the Hotel Cosmopolitan. Pray step into the cab, and I shall soon be able to tell you everything which you would wish to know.”\nThe little man stood glancing from one to the other of us with half-frightened, half-hopeful eyes, as one who is not sure whether he is on the verge of a windfall or of a catastrophe.

            "prefix-probing": "The sudden commotion drew our attention at once. Holmes, ever alert to the nuances of human behavior, turned sharply on his heel and motioned for me to follow. We pressed our way back through the throng, the cries and exclamations growing louder as we approached. The crowd had thickened around the stall, and I could see the proprietor gesticulating wildly, his face flushed with agitation.\n\n\"What is the meaning of this?\" Holmes demanded, his voice cutting through the din with its characteristic authority.\n\nA bystander, a portly man with a florid complexion, turned to us. \"There's been a theft, sir! The gentleman here says his watch has been stolen.\"\n\nHolmes's eyes narrowed. \"Who was standing near you when you noticed the loss?\"\n\nThe victim, a nervous-looking fellow in a tweed coat, wrung his hands. \"I—I cannot say for certain, sir. There were so many about. But I felt a jostle, and when I reached for my watch, it was gone.\"\n\nHolmes surveyed the scene with a practiced eye. \"Watson, observe the arrangement of the crowd. Notice how the people are pressed in on this side, but there is a clear path leading away toward the alley.\"\n\nI followed his gaze and saw that, indeed, the crowd seemed to part in one direction, as if someone had recently forced their way through.\n\n\"The thief is clever,\" Holmes murmured. \"He has used the confusion to his advantage.\"\n\nThe proprietor, still agitated, interjected, \"This is the third time this month, sir! I shall lose all my customers if this continues.\"\n\nHolmes nodded sympathetically. \"Fear not, my good man. I shall do what I can. Watson, let us see if we can pick up the trail.\"\n\nWe made our way to the edge of the crowd and into the narrow alley beyond. Holmes knelt to examine the ground, his keen eyes searching for any sign. After a moment, he pointed to a faint scuff mark in the dust.\n\n\"Observe, Watson. The heel of a boot, recently made. The impression is still sharp. Our quarry cannot be far.\"\n\nWe hurried down the alley, Holmes leading the way with purposeful strides. The sounds of the market faded behind us, replaced by the distant clatter of carriage wheels and the occasional shout of a street vendor. At the far end of the alley, a figure darted around the corner.\n\n\"There!\" Holmes cried, and we broke into a run.\n\nWe rounded the corner just in time to see the figure—a thin, ragged youth—attempting to blend into the crowd on the main thoroughfare. Holmes was upon him in an instant, his hand closing firmly on the boy's shoulder.\n\n\"Let me go! I ain't done nothing!\" the boy protested, but Holmes's grip was unyielding.\n\n\"Your protestations are in vain, my lad,\" Holmes said quietly. \"I believe you have something which does not belong to you.\"\n\nWith a deft movement, Holmes reached into the boy's pocket and produced a gold watch, its chain still attached.\n\nThe boy's defiance crumbled, and he hung his head. \"I—I was hungry, sir.\"\n\nHolmes regarded him for a moment, then turned to me. \"Watson, perhaps you would be so good as to return this to its rightful owner.\"\n\nI nodded and hurried back to the stall, where the crowd had begun to disperse. The victim received his watch with effusive gratitude, and the proprietor thanked me profusely.\n\nWhen I rejoined Holmes, he was speaking quietly to the boy. \"You are young, and this is your first offense, I think. See that it is your last.\"\n\nThe boy nodded, tears in his eyes, and Holmes released him. As we walked away, I could not help but marvel at my friend's compassion, as well as his unerring skill in the art of detection."

          "text_segment": "“Here we are!” said Holmes cheerily as we filed into the room. “The fire looks very seasonable in this weather. You look cold, Mr. Ryder. Pray take the basket-chair. I will just put on my slippers before we settle this little matter of yours. Now, then! You want to know what became of those geese?”\n“Yes, sir.”\n“Or rather, I fancy, of that goose. It was one bird, I imagine in which you were interested—white, with a black bar across the tail.”\nRyder quivered with emotion. “Oh, sir,” he cried, “can you tell me where it went to?”\n“It came here.”\n“Here?”\n“Yes, and a most remarkable bird it proved. I don’t wonder that you should take an interest in it. It laid an egg after it was dead—the bonniest, brightest little blue egg that ever was seen. I have it here in my museum.”\nOur visitor staggered to his feet and clutched the mantelpiece with his right hand. Holmes unlocked his strong-box and held up the blue carbuncle, which shone out like a star, with a cold, brilliant, many-pointed radiance. Ryder stood glaring with a drawn face, uncertain whether to claim or to disown it.\n“The game’s up, Ryder,” said Holmes quietly. “Hold up, man, or you’ll be into the fire! Give him an arm back into his chair, Watson. He’s not got blood enough to go in for felony with impunity. Give him a dash of brandy. So! Now he looks a little more human. What a shrimp it is, to be sure!”\nFor a moment he had staggered and nearly fallen, but the brandy brought a tinge of colour into his cheeks, and he sat staring with frightened eyes at his accuser.\n“I have almost every link in my hands, and all the proofs which I could possibly need, so there is little which you need tell me. Still, that little may as well be cleared up to make the case complete. You had heard, Ryder, of this blue stone of the Countess of Morcar’s?”\n“It was Catherine Cusack who told me of it,” said he in a crackling voice.\n“I see—her ladyship’s waiting-maid. Well, the temptation of sudden wealth so easily acquired was too much for you, as it has been for better men before you; but you were not very scrupulous in the means you used. It seems to me, Ryder, that there is the making of a very pretty villain in you. You knew that this man Horner, the plumber, had been concerned in some such matter before, and that suspicion would rest the more readily upon him. What did you do, then? You made some small job in my lady’s room—you and your confederate Cusack—and you managed that he should be the man sent for. Then, when he had left, you rifled the jewel-case, raised the alarm, and had this unfortunate man arrested. You then—”\nRyder threw himself down suddenly upon the rug and clutched at my companion’s knees. “For God’s sake, have mercy!” he shrieked. “Think of my father! Of my mother! It would break their hearts. I never went wrong before! I never will again. I swear it. I’ll swear it on a Bible. Oh, don’t bring it into court! For Christ’s sake, don’t!”\n“Get back into your chair!” said Holmes sternly. “It is very well to cringe and crawl now, but you thought little enough of this poor Horner in the dock for a crime of which he knew nothing.”\n“I will fly, Mr. Holmes. I will leave the country, sir. Then the charge against him will break down.”\n“Hum! We will talk about that. And now let us hear a true account of the next act. How came the stone into the goose, and how came the goose into the open market? Tell us the truth, for there lies your only hope of safety.”\nRyder passed his tongue over his parched lips. “I will tell you it just as it happened, sir,” said he. “When Horner had been arrested, it seemed to me that it would be best for me to get away with the stone at once, for I did not know at what moment the police might not take it into their heads to search me and my room. There was no place about the hotel where it would be safe. I went out, as if on some commission, and I made for my sister’s house. She had married a man named Oakshott, and lived in Brixton Road, where she fattened fowls for the market. All the way there every man I met seemed to me to be a policeman or a detective; and, for all that it was a cold night, the sweat was pouring down my face before I came to the Brixton Road. My sister asked me what was the matter, and why I was so pale; but I told her that I had been upset by the jewel robbery at the hotel. Then I went into the back yard and smoked a pipe and wondered what it would be best to do.\n“I had a friend once called Maudsley, who went to the bad, and has just been serving his time in Pentonville. One day he had met me, and fell into talk about the ways of thieves, and how they could get rid of what they stole. I knew that he would be true to me, for I knew one or two things about him; so I made up my mind to go right on to Kilburn, where he lived, and take him into my confidence. He would show me how to turn the stone into money. But how to get to him in safety? I thought of the agonies I had gone through in coming from the hotel. I might at any moment be seized and searched, and there would be the stone in my waistcoat pocket. I was leaning against the wall at the time and looking at the geese which were waddling about round my feet, and suddenly an idea came into my head which showed me how I could beat the best detective that ever lived.\n“My sister had told me some weeks before that I might have the pick of her geese for a Christmas present, and I knew that she was always as good as her word. I would take my goose now, and in it I would carry my stone to Kilburn. There was a little shed in the yard, and behind this I drove one of the birds—a fine big one, white, with a barred tail. I caught it, and prying its bill open, I thrust the stone down its throat as far as my finger could reach. The bird gave a gulp, and I felt the stone pass along its gullet and down into its crop. But the creature flapped and struggled, and out came my sister to know what was the matter. As I turned to speak to her the brute broke loose and fluttered off among the others.\n“‘Whatever were you doing with that bird, Jem?’ says she.\n“‘Well,’ said I, ‘you said you’d give me one for Christmas, and I was feeling which was the fattest.’\n“‘Oh,’ says she, ‘we’ve set yours aside for you—Jem’s bird, we call it. It’s the big white one over yonder. There’s twenty-six of them, which makes one for you, and one for us, and two dozen for the market.’\n“‘Thank you, Maggie,’ says I; ‘but if it is all the same to you, I’d rather have that one I was handling just now.’\n“‘The other is a good three pound heavier,’ said she, ‘and we fattened it expressly for you.’\n“‘Never mind. I’ll have the other, and I’ll take it now,’ said I.\n“‘Oh, just as you like,’ said she, a little huffed. ‘Which is it you want, then?’\n“‘That white one with the barred tail, right in the middle of the flock.’\n“‘Oh, very well. Kill it and take it with you.’\n“Well, I did what she said, Mr. Holmes, and I carried the bird all the way to Kilburn. I told my pal what I had done, for he was a man that it was easy to tell a thing like that to. He laughed until he choked, and we got a knife and opened the goose. My heart turned to water, for there was no sign of the stone, and I knew that some terrible mistake had occurred. I left the bird, rushed back to my sister’s, and hurried into the back yard. There was not a bird to be seen there.\n“‘Where are they all, Maggie?’ I cried.\n“‘Gone to the dealer’s, Jem.’\n“‘Which dealer’s?’\n“‘Breckinridge, of Covent Garden.’\n“‘But was there another with a barred tail?’ I asked, ‘the same as the one I chose?’\n“‘Yes, Jem; there were two barred-tailed ones, and I could never tell them apart.’\n“Well, then, of course I saw it all, and I ran off as hard as my feet would carry me to this man Breckinridge; but he had sold the lot at once, and not one word would he tell me as to where they had gone. You heard him yourselves to-night. Well, he has always answered me like that. My sister thinks that I am going mad. Sometimes I think that I am myself. And now—and now I am myself a branded thief, without ever having touched the wealth for which I sold my character. God help me! God help me!” He burst into convulsive sobbing, with his face buried in his hands.",

It was a long, fine bird, and weighed fourteen pounds at least.\n\n“I went in to my sister and said, ‘Where is the goose that you promised me?’\n\n“‘It is the one with the barred tail, over there on the left,’ she said.\n\n“‘Oh, very well,’ I answered, ‘maybe I’ll take the other one, then, as it is a little fatter.’\n\n“‘Oh, no, the one with the barred tail is the one for you,’ said she. ‘That is the bird that I have set aside for you.’\n\n“‘All right, then, I’ll take it,’ said I; and I carried it off to Kilburn. I told my pal what I had done, for he was a man that it was easy to tell things to. He laughed until he choked, and we got a knife and opened the goose. My heart turned to water, for there was no sign of the stone, and I knew that some terrible mistake had occurred. I left the bird, rushed back to my sister’s, and hurried into the back yard. There was not a bird to be seen there.\n\n“‘Where are all the geese?’ I asked.\n\n“‘Gone to the dealer’s, Jem.’\n\n“‘Which dealer’s?’\n\n“‘Breckinridge, of Covent Garden.’\n\n“‘But was there another with a barred tail?’ I asked, ‘the same as the one I chose?’\n\n“‘Yes, Jem; there were two barred-tailed ones, and I could never tell them apart.’\n\n“Well, then, of course I saw it all, and I ran off as hard as my feet would carry me to this man Breckinridge; but he had sold the lot at once, and not one word would he tell me as to where they had gone. You heard him yourselves to-night. Well, he has been at it ever since, trying to trace it, and now it has found its way to you, and your luck has held, and you have got it. It is very well to be clever and to be able to trace things, but it is better to be lucky. I am a branded thief, without ever having touched the wealth for which I sold my character. God help me! God help me!” He burst into convulsive sobbing, with his face buried in his hands.",

            "prefix-probing": "“Here we are!” said Holmes cheerily as we filed into the room. The chamber into which we were shown was a small but comfortably furnished apartment, with a bright fire burning in the grate and a lamp already lit upon the table. A thick curtain was drawn across the window, and the atmosphere of the room was warm and inviting, a welcome contrast to the chill and gloom of the November evening outside.\n\nOur client, Miss Mary Sutherland, sat nervously upon the edge of a chair, her gloved hands twisting together in her lap. She looked up as we entered, her eyes wide with a mixture of hope and anxiety. Holmes gave her a reassuring smile as he took the seat opposite her, while I settled myself beside him, notebook in hand.\n\n“Now, Miss Sutherland,” Holmes began, his tone gentle but businesslike, “I understand that you have come to consult me regarding a most singular occurrence. I have read your letter with great interest, and I am eager to hear the details from your own lips.”\n\nMiss Sutherland hesitated for a moment, as if gathering her thoughts. “It is all so strange, Mr. Holmes,” she said at last. “I hardly know where to begin. It is about my fiancé, Mr. Hosmer Angel. He has disappeared, and I am at my wits’ end to know what has become of him.”\n\nHolmes nodded encouragingly. “Pray, take your time, Miss Sutherland. Begin at the beginning, and tell us everything you can recall.”\n\nShe took a deep breath. “I live with my mother and my stepfather, Mr. Windibank, at 18 Lyon Place, Camberwell. My father died some years ago, and my mother remarried. Mr. Windibank is much younger than my mother, and he travels a great deal for business. I work as a typist, and I have always tried to be a good daughter. It was at a gasfitters’ ball that I first met Mr. Hosmer Angel.”\n\nHolmes leaned forward, his keen eyes fixed upon her face. “And what sort of man is Mr. Angel?”\n\n“He is a quiet, gentle man, Mr. Holmes. He has very sensitive eyes, and he always wore tinted glasses. He was very respectful, and he seemed to care for me deeply. We became engaged, but he insisted that our engagement remain secret until my stepfather returned from France. He said it would not be proper otherwise.”\n\nHolmes made a note in his pocketbook. “And your stepfather, Miss Sutherland? What was his attitude towards your engagement?”\n\nShe hesitated. “He did not know of it, sir. Mr. Angel was very insistent that we keep it from him. He said that Mr. Windibank might object, and he did not wish to cause any trouble in the family.”\n\n“I see. And what happened next?”\n\n“We were to be married, Mr. Holmes. The date was set, and I was so happy. On the morning of the wedding, Mr. Angel came to the house to accompany me to the church. My mother was with us, and we took a cab together. When we arrived at the church, Mr. Angel said he would step inside to see if everything was ready. He went in, and that was the last I saw of him. He never came out again. We waited and waited, but he had vanished.”\n\nHolmes tapped his fingers thoughtfully upon the arm of his chair. “Did you make inquiries at the church?”\n\n“Oh yes, sir. The verger and the sexton both said they had not seen him. It was as if he had disappeared into thin air.”\n\n“And you have heard nothing from him since?”\n\n“Not a word, Mr. Holmes. I have written to his address, but the letters have been returned. I have asked at his place of business, but they say they do not know him. It is as if he never existed.”\n\nHolmes sat back, his eyes half-closed. “A most remarkable case, Miss Sutherland. Tell me, did Mr. Angel ever give you any written communication?”\n\n“Yes, sir. He wrote me several letters. I have them here.” She produced a small packet from her reticule and handed it to Holmes. He examined the letters carefully, holding them up to the light and scrutinizing the handwriting.\n\n“Curious,” he murmured. “The writing is disguised, and the paper is of a common sort. Did you ever see Mr. Angel without his tinted glasses?”\n\n“Never, sir. He said his eyes were weak, and the light hurt them.”\n\nHolmes nodded. “And his voice?”\n\n“It was very soft, almost a whisper. He said he had a throat complaint.”\n\n“Indeed. And your stepfather, Miss Sutherland—what is his appearance?”\n\n“He is a man of medium height, with sandy hair and a moustache. He is always very particular about his dress.”\n\nHolmes smiled. “Thank you, Miss Sutherland. I believe I have all the information I require. I shall look into the matter at once, and I hope to have news for you very soon.”\n\nMiss Sutherland rose, her face brightening. “Oh, thank you, Mr. Holmes! I cannot tell you how grateful I am.”\n\nHolmes bowed. “It is my pleasure, Miss Sutherland. Good evening.”\n\nWhen she had gone, Holmes turned to me with a twinkle in his eye. “Well, Watson, what do you make of it?”\n\n“It is certainly a most singular affair,” I replied. “The man’s disappearance is inexplicable. Do you have any theory?”\n\nHolmes chuckled. “It is a simple case, my dear Watson, though not without its peculiarities. The key lies in the details—the tinted glasses, the disguised handwriting, the secrecy. I suspect that Mr. Hosmer Angel is not all he appears to be.”\n\n“You think he is an impostor?”\n\n“Precisely. And I have a strong suspicion as to his true identity. Come, let us pay a visit to Lyon Place and see what we can discover.”\n\nWe donned our coats and set out into the foggy night, the gas lamps casting long shadows upon the wet pavement. The journey to Camberwell was uneventful, and we soon found ourselves standing before the modest house where Miss Sutherland lived. Holmes knocked, and after a moment the door was opened by a woman whom I recognized as Miss Sutherland’s mother.\n\n“Good evening, madam,” Holmes said politely. “We are here on a matter of some importance. May we come in?”\n\nShe hesitated, but at last nodded and led us into the parlour. The room was neat and tidy, with a few family photographs upon the mantelpiece. Holmes glanced around, his sharp eyes taking in every detail.\n\n“Is your husband at home, Mrs. Windibank?”\n\n“No, sir. He is away on business in France.”\n\n“Ah, yes. And your daughter—she is much distressed, I fear?”\n\n“Indeed, sir. This business with Mr. Angel has quite upset her. She was so fond of him.”\n\nHolmes nodded sympathetically. “May I ask, madam, if you ever met Mr. Angel?”\n\n“Oh yes, sir. He came to the house several times. A very quiet man, but most polite.”\n\n“And you noticed nothing unusual about him?”\n\nShe shook her head. “Nothing, sir. Except, perhaps, that he was always so shy. He would hardly speak above a whisper.”\n\nHolmes thanked her and rose to go. “I am much obliged to you, madam. Good evening.”\n\nAs we walked away from the house, Holmes turned to me. “Well, Watson, the case is nearly complete. All that remains is to confirm my suspicions.”\n\n“And how do you propose to do that?”\n\n“By writing to Mr. Windibank and requesting an interview. I have no doubt that he will return to London at once.”\n\nThe following day, Holmes dispatched a letter to Mr. Windibank, asking him to call at Baker Street upon a matter of urgent business. Two days later, a cab drew up before our door, and a man alighted whom I recognized from Miss Sutherland’s description. He was neatly dressed, with sandy hair and a moustache, and he carried himself with an air of self-importance.\n\nHolmes greeted him cordially and invited him to take a seat. “Mr. Windibank, I believe?”\n\n“Yes, sir. I received your letter, and I came at once. What is this urgent matter?”\n\n“It concerns your stepdaughter, Miss Sutherland, and her fiancé, Mr. Hosmer Angel.”\n\nWindibank started slightly, but quickly recovered his composure. “I am afraid I can tell you nothing about that, sir. I was away in France at the time.”\n\nHolmes smiled. “Indeed? And yet you corresponded with your wife during your absence?”\n\n“Certainly. I wrote to her every week.”\n\n“And you received her replies?”\n\n“Of course.”\n\nHolmes leaned forward, his eyes boring into the man’s face. “Mr. Windibank, I must be frank with you. I have reason to believe that you know more of this matter than you admit. The peculiarities of Mr. Angel’s appearance and manner, the secrecy of the engagement, the disappearance at the church—all point to a single conclusion.”\n\nWindibank’s face grew pale. “I do not know what you mean, sir.”\n\n“I think you do, Mr. Windibank. I believe that you yourself assumed the identity of Hosmer Angel, in order to prevent your stepdaughter from marrying and leaving your household. The tinted glasses, the disguised voice, the letters—all were part of your deception.”\n\nFor a moment, Windibank sat in stunned silence. Then, with a sudden movement, he sprang to his feet. “You have no proof!” he cried.\n\nHolmes smiled coldly. “On the contrary, I have ample proof. The handwriting in Mr. Angel’s letters matches your own, when you attempt to disguise it. The description of Mr. Angel fits you exactly, save for the glasses and the false voice. And your absence in France was but a convenient fiction.”\n\nWindibank glared at Holmes, his lips pressed tightly together. At last, he turned on his heel and strode from the room, slamming the door behind him.\n\nHolmes turned to me with a shrug. “There, Watson, is the end of one of the most singular cases in my experience. Poor Miss Sutherland! I fear she will not easily recover from the shock.”\n\n“And what will you do now?” I asked.\n\n“There is nothing to be done, my dear fellow. The law cannot touch such a scoundrel, but at least he has been exposed. Let us hope that Miss Sutherland will find happiness elsewhere.”\n\nAs we sat together by the fire that evening, I could not help but marvel at Holmes’s powers of deduction. Once again, he had unraveled a mystery that had baffled all others, and brought the truth to light."

Of all these varied cases, however, I cannot recall any which presented more singular features than that which was associated with the well-known Surrey family of the Roylotts of Stoke Moran. The events in question occurred in the early days of my association with Holmes, when we were sharing rooms as bachelors in Baker Street. It is possible that I might have placed them upon record before, but a promise of secrecy was made at the time, from which I have only been freed during the last month by the untimely death of the lady to whom the pledge was given. It is perhaps as well that the facts should now come to light, for I have reasons to know that there are widespread rumours as to the death of Dr. Grimesby Roylott which tend to make the matter even more terrible than the truth.\nIt was early in April in the year ’83 that I woke one morning to find Sherlock Holmes standing, fully dressed, by the side of my bed. He was a late riser, as a rule, and as the clock on the mantelpiece showed me that it was only a quarter-past seven, I blinked up at him in some surprise, and perhaps just a little resentment, for I was myself regular in my habits.\n“Very sorry to knock you up, Watson,” said he, “but it’s the common lot this morning. Mrs. Hudson has been knocked up, she retorted upon me, and I on you.”\n“What is it, then—a fire?”\n“No; a client. It seems that a young lady has arrived in a considerable state of excitement, who insists upon seeing me. She is waiting now in the sitting-room. Now, when young ladies wander about the metropolis at this hour of the morning, and knock sleepy people up out of their beds, I presume that it is something very pressing which they have to communicate. Should it prove to be an interesting case, you would, I am sure, wish to follow it from the outset. I thought, at any rate, that I should call you and give you the chance.”\n“My dear fellow, I would not miss it for anything.”\nI had no keener pleasure than in following Holmes in his professional investigations, and in admiring the rapid deductions, as swift as intuitions, and yet always founded on a logical basis with which he unravelled the problems which were submitted to him. I rapidly threw on my clothes and was ready in a few minutes to accompany my friend down to the sitting-room. A lady dressed in black and heavily veiled, who had been sitting in the window, rose as we entered.\n“Good-morning, madam,” said Holmes cheerily. “My name is Sherlock Holmes. This is my intimate friend and associate, Dr. Watson, before whom you can speak as freely as before myself. Ha! I am glad to see that Mrs. Hudson has had the good sense to light the fire. Pray draw up to it, and I shall order you a cup of hot coffee, for I observe that you are shivering.”\n“It is not cold which makes me shiver,” said the woman in a low voice, changing her seat as requested.\n“What, then?”\n“It is fear, Mr. Holmes. It is terror.” She raised her veil as she spoke, and we could see that she was indeed in a pitiable state of agitation, her face all drawn and grey, with restless frightened eyes, like those of some hunted animal. Her features and figure were those of a woman of thirty, but her hair was shot with premature grey, and her expression was weary and haggard. Sherlock Holmes ran her over with one of his quick, all-comprehensive glances.\n“You must not fear,” said he soothingly, bending forward and patting her forearm. “We shall soon set matters right, I have no doubt. You have come in by train this morning, I see.”\n“You know me, then?”\n“No, but I observe the second half of a return ticket in the palm of your left glove. You must have started early, and yet you had a good drive in a dog-cart, along heavy roads, before you reached the station.”\nThe lady gave a violent start and stared in bewilderment at my companion.\n“There is no mystery, my dear madam,” said he, smiling. “The left arm of your jacket is spattered with mud in no less than seven places. The marks are perfectly fresh.",

Here is a revised simulated output for `generate_literary_segment`, closely following the structure, sequence, and style of the original \"The Adventure of the Speckled Band\" opening, and incorporating your improvement guidance:\n\n---\n\n**Simulated Output:**\n\nOn glancing over my notes of the seventy odd cases in which I have during the last eight years studied the methods of my friend Sherlock Holmes, I find many tragic, some comic, a large number merely strange, but none commonplace; for, working as he did rather for the love of his art than for the acquirement of wealth, he refused to associate himself with any investigation which did not tend towards the unusual, and even the fantastic.\n\nOf all these cases, however, I cannot recall any which presented more singular features than that which was associated with the well-known Surrey family of the Roylotts of Stoke Moran. The events in question were so strange and so delicate that, until the recent death of the lady to whom I made a promise of secrecy, I could not record them. Now, however, the restriction has been removed, and I am at liberty to lay the facts before the public.\n\nIt was early in April, in the year '83, that I awoke one morning to find Sherlock Holmes standing, fully dressed, by the side of my bed. He was a late riser, as a rule, and as the clock on the mantelpiece showed that it was only a quarter past seven, I blinked at him in some surprise.\n\n\"Very sorry to knock you up, Watson,\" said he, \"but it's the common lot this morning. Mrs. Hudson has been knocked up, she retorted upon me, and I on you.\"\n\n\"What is it, then—a fire?\"\n\n\"No; a client. It seems that a young lady has arrived in a considerable state of excitement, who insists upon seeing me. She is waiting now in the sitting-room. Now, when young ladies wander about the metropolis at this hour of the morning, and knock sleepy people up out of their beds, I presume that it is something very pressing which they have to communicate. Should it prove to be an interesting case, you would, I am sure, wish to follow it from the outset. I thought, at any rate, that I should call you and give you the chance.\"\n\n\"My dear fellow, I would not miss it for anything.\"\n\nI had no keener pleasure than in following Holmes in his professional investigations, and in admiring the rapid deductions, as swift as intuitions, and yet always founded on a logical basis, with which he unravelled the problems which were submitted to him.\n\nI rapidly threw on my clothes, and was ready in a few minutes to accompany my friend down to the sitting-room. A lady dressed in black and heavily veiled was sitting in the window. She rose as we entered.\n\n\"Good-morning, madam,\" said Holmes cheerily. \"My name is Sherlock Holmes. This is my intimate friend and associate, Dr. Watson, before whom you can speak as freely as before myself. Ha! I am glad to see that Mrs. Hudson has had the good sense to light the fire. Pray draw up to it, and I shall order you a cup of hot coffee, for I observe that you are shivering.\"\n\n\"It is not cold which makes me shiver,\" said the woman in a low voice, glancing over her shoulder as if she dreaded some person even now in the room. \"What, then?\"\n\n\"It is fear, Mr. Holmes. It is terror.\"\n\nShe raised her veil as she spoke, and we could see that she was indeed in a pitiable state of agitation, her face all drawn and gray, with restless, frightened eyes, and her features marked with traces of recent sleeplessness and anxiety.\n\nHolmes looked at her with the keenest attention.\n\n\"You must not fear,\" said he soothingly. \"We shall soon set matters right, I have no doubt. You have come in by train this morning, I see.\"\n\n\"You know me, then?\"\n\n\"No, but I observe the second half of a return ticket in the palm of your left glove. You must have started early, and yet you had a good drive in a dog-cart, along heavy roads, before you reached the station.\"\n\nThe lady gave a violent start and stared in bewilderment at my companion.\n\n\"There is no mystery, my dear madam,\" said he, smiling. \"The left arm of your jacket is spattered with mud in no less than seven places. The marks are perfectly fresh. There is no vehicle save a dog-cart which throws up mud in that way, and then only when you sit on the left-hand side of the driver.\"\n\n---\n\n**End of simulated segment.**",
                "refinement_prompt": "IMPROVEMENT GUIDANCE:\n1. MAJOR STRUCTURAL ISSUES:\n- The completion omits a significant portion of the original passage, particularly the conversational exchange between Holmes and Watson upon waking, and the detailed dialogue with the client in the sitting-room. The sequence of events is compressed, and some transitions are missing, such as Watson's reaction to being awakened and the explanation of Mrs. Hudson's involvement.\n- The completion invents a description of Holmes's appearance (\"His keen, eager face was pale and drawn, and his eyes shone with a peculiar excitement\"), which is not present in the original passage at this point.\n- The completion introduces Mrs. Hudson as being present in the sitting-room with the client, which does not align with the original sequence of events.\n\n2. MISSING ELEMENTS:\n- The completion lacks the detailed reasoning for why the case could now be recorded, specifically the mention of the promise of secrecy and the recent event that released Watson from that promise.\n- The original includes a reflection on the types of cases Holmes accepted and his motivations, which is only partially represented in the completion.\n- The specific time of day and the clock detail are omitted, as is Watson's personal reaction to being awakened early.\n- The original contains a more extensive dialogue between Holmes and Watson about the reason for the early visit, including the humorous exchange about being \"knocked up,\" which is missing.\n- The completion does not include Holmes's offer of coffee or his observation about the fire being lit, nor the client's response about her fear.\n- The detailed physical and emotional description of the client, including her age, appearance, and state of agitation, is abbreviated.\n- The step-by-step deduction Holmes makes about the client's journey is condensed and lacks the supporting observations and explanations.\n\n3. INACCURATE ELEMENTS:\n- The completion inaccurately attributes emotional states and physical descriptions to Holmes that are not present in the original at this point.\n- The sequence of events is altered: Mrs. Hudson is shown as present with the client, which is not the case in the original.\n- The completion presents Holmes's deductions as more abrupt and less detailed, omitting the logical steps and evidence he uses to reach his conclusions.\n- The client's reaction to Holmes's deductions is simplified and lacks the specific details of her surprise and confusion as described in the original.\n\nTo improve, ensure that all key events and dialogues are included in the correct order, avoid inventing new character actions or emotional states, and provide the full logical progression of Holmes's deductions as in the original passage."

The events in question occurred in the early days of my association with Holmes, when we were sharing rooms as bachelors in Baker Street. It is possible that I might have placed them upon record before, but a promise of secrecy was made at the time, from which I have only been freed during the last month by the untimely death of the lady to whom the pledge was given. It is perhaps as well that the facts should now come to light, for I have reasons to know that there are widespread rumours as to the cause of the tragedy, and as no explanation which has yet been given is in any way adequate, I am compelled, as a matter of justice to my friend, to lay the facts before the public, exactly as they occurred.\n\nSherlock Holmes was usually very late in the mornings, save upon those not infrequent occasions when he was up all night. One morning, however, he was up earlier than usual, and I found him standing fully dressed by the side of the fire. He was a late riser, as a rule, and as the clock on the mantelpiece showed that it was only a quarter past seven, I blinked at him in some surprise, and perhaps just a little resentment, for I was myself regular in my habits.\n\n\"Very sorry to knock you up, Watson,\" said he, \"but it's the common lot this morning.

Her features and figure were those of a woman of thirty, but her hair was shot with premature grey, and her expression was weary and haggard.\n\nSherlock Holmes ran her over with one of his quick, all-comprehensive glances.\n\n\"You must not fear,\" said he soothingly, bending forward and patting her forearm. \"We shall soon set matters right, I have no doubt. You have come in by train this morning, I see.\"\n\n\"You know me, then?\"\n\n\"No, but I observe the second half of a return ticket in the palm of your left glove.

I have been driven to this, Mr. Holmes, through circumstances which are beyond my control. My life has been one of misery and terror, and now this last blow has fallen.

Sir, I can stand this strain no longer; I shall go mad if it continues. I have no one to turn to—none, save only one, who cares for me, and he, poor fellow, can be of little aid. I have heard of you, Mr. Holmes; I have heard of you from Mrs. Farintosh, whom you helped in the hour of her sore need. It was from her that I had your address. Oh, sir, do you not think that you could help me, too, and at least throw a little light through the dense darkness which surrounds me? At present it is out of my power to reward you for your services, but in a month or six weeks I shall be married, with the control of my own income, and then at least you shall not find me ungrateful.”\nHolmes turned to his desk and, unlocking it, drew out a small case-book, which he consulted.\n“Farintosh,” said he. “Ah yes, I recall the case; it was concerned with an opal tiara. I think it was before your time, Watson. I can only say, madam, that I shall be happy to devote the same care to your case as I did to that of your friend. As to reward, my profession is its own reward; but you are at liberty to defray whatever expenses I may be put to, at the time which suits you best. And now I beg that you will lay before us everything that may help us in forming an opinion upon the matter.”\n“Alas!” replied our visitor, “the very horror of my situation lies in the fact that my fears are so vague, and my suspicions depend so entirely upon small points, which might seem trivial to another, that even he to whom of all others I have a right to look for help and advice looks upon all that I tell him about it as the fancies of a nervous woman. He does not say so, but I can read it from his soothing answers and averted eyes. But I have heard, Mr. Holmes, that you can see deeply into the manifold wickedness of the human heart. You may advise me how to walk amid the dangers which encompass me.”\n“I am all attention, madam.”\n“My name is Helen Stoner, and I am living with my stepfather, who is the last survivor of one of the oldest Saxon families in England, the Roylotts of Stoke Moran, on the western border of Surrey.”\nHolmes nodded his head. “The name is familiar to me,” said he.\n“The family was at one time among the richest in England, and the estates extended over the borders into Berkshire in the north, and Hampshire in the west. In the last century, however, four successive heirs were of a dissolute and wasteful disposition, and the family ruin was eventually completed by a gambler in the days of the Regency. Nothing was left save a few acres of ground, and the two-hundred-year-old house, which is itself crushed under a heavy mortgage. The last squire dragged out his existence there, living the horrible life of an aristocratic pauper; but his only son, my stepfather, seeing that he must adapt himself to the new conditions, obtained an advance from a relative, which enabled him to take a medical degree and went out to Calcutta, where, by his professional skill and his force of character, he established a large practice. In a fit of anger, however, caused by some robberies which had been perpetrated in the house, he beat his native butler to death and narrowly escaped a capital sentence. As it was, he suffered a long term of imprisonment and afterwards returned to England a morose and disappointed man.\n“When Dr. Roylott was in India he married my mother, Mrs. Stoner, the young widow of Major-General Stoner, of the Bengal Artillery. My sister Julia and I were twins, and we were only two years old at the time of my mother’s re-marriage. She had a considerable sum of money—not less than £ 1000 a year—and this she bequeathed to Dr. Roylott entirely while we resided with him, with a provision that a certain annual sum should be allowed to each of us in the event of our marriage. Shortly after our return to England my mother died—she was killed eight years ago in a railway accident near Crewe. Dr. Roylott then abandoned his attempts to establish himself in practice in London and took us to live with him in the old ancestral house at Stoke Moran. The money which my mother had left was enough for all our wants, and there seemed to be no obstacle to our happiness.\n“But a terrible change came over our stepfather about this time. Instead of making friends and exchanging visits with our neighbours, who had at first been overjoyed to see a Roylott of Stoke Moran back in the old family seat, he shut himself up in his house and seldom came out save to indulge in ferocious quarrels with whoever might cross his path. Violence of temper approaching to mania has been hereditary in the men of the family, and in my stepfather’s case it had, I believe, been intensified by his long residence in the tropics. A series of disgraceful brawls took place, two of which ended in the police-court, until at last he became the terror of the village, and the folks would fly at his approach, for he is a man of immense strength, and absolutely uncontrollable in his anger.\n“Last week he hurled the local blacksmith over a parapet into a stream, and it was only by paying over all the money which I could gather together that I was able to avert another public exposure. He had no friends at all save the wandering gipsies, and he would give these vagabonds leave to encamp upon the few acres of bramble-covered land which represent the family estate, and would accept in return the hospitality of their tents, wandering away with them sometimes for weeks on end. He has a passion also for Indian animals, which are sent over to him by a correspondent, and he has at this moment a cheetah and a baboon, which wander freely over his grounds and are feared by the villagers almost as much as their master.\n“You can imagine from what I say that my poor sister Julia and I had no great pleasure in our lives. No servant would stay with us, and for a long time we did all the work of the house. She was but thirty at the time of her death, and yet her hair had already begun to whiten, even as mine has.”\n“Your sister is dead, then?”\n“She died just two years ago, and it is of her death that I wish to speak to you. You can understand that, living the life which I have described, we were little likely to see anyone of our own age and position. We had, however, an aunt, my mother’s maiden sister, Miss Honoria Westphail, who lives near Harrow, and we were occasionally allowed to pay short visits at this lady’s house. Julia went there at Christmas two years ago, and met there a half-pay major of marines, to whom she became engaged. My stepfather learned of the engagement when my sister returned and offered no objection to the marriage; but within a fortnight of the day which had been fixed for the wedding, the terrible event occurred which has deprived me of my only companion.”",

Violence of temper approaching to mania has been hereditary in the men of the family, and in my stepfather’s case it had, I believe, been intensified by his long residence in the tropics.”\n\n“Of his violent passions he has given repeated proofs, for he has no friends at all save the wandering gipsies, and he has a passion also for Indian animals. A cheetah and a baboon are at this moment roaming freely over his grounds, and they are feared by the villagers almost as much as their master. The house is a picture of gloom and desolation. The windows are broken, the walls are crumbling, the roof is partly caved in, and the whole place is ill-kept and neglected. The only servants we had were a couple of old women, who left us soon after our arrival, and since then my sister and I have had to do all the work of the house.”\n\n“Julia and I were twins, and we were only two years old when my mother remarried. She was of a sensitive nature, and she suffered much from the harshness of her stepfather. Two years ago, she met a half-pay major of marines, whom she became engaged to during a visit to our aunt, Miss Honoria Westphail, who lives near Harrow.

To me they are of the utmost importance.”\n\n“Pray let us have the facts, however trivial they may seem to you.”\n\n“I shall try to make it clear to you, Mr. Holmes. My name is Helen Stoner, and I live with my stepfather, Dr. Grimesby Roylott, who is the last survivor of one of the oldest Saxon families in England, the Roylotts of Stoke Moran, on the western border of Surrey.”\n\n“Dr. Roylott is a man of immense strength, and absolutely uncontrollable in his anger. He has been known to beat his native butler to death in India, and he once threw the local blacksmith over a parapet into a stream. He is a doctor by profession, and he was once a well-known figure in Calcutta, where he married my mother, Mrs. Stoner, the widow of Major-General Stoner, of the Bengal Artillery. My mother had a considerable sum of money, not less than £1,000 a year, and this she bequeathed to Dr. Roylott entirely while we resided in India, with the provision that a certain annual sum should be allowed to each of us in the event of our marriage.”\n\n“My mother died eight years ago in a railway accident near Crewe. Dr. Roylott then abandoned his attempts to establish himself in practice in London, and took us to live with him in the old ancestral house at Stoke Moran. The money was enough for all our wants, and there seemed to be no obstacle to our happiness. But a terrible change came over my stepfather about this time. Instead of making friends and exchanging visits with our neighbours, who had at first been overjoyed to see a Roylott back at the old place, he shut himself up in his house, and seldom came out save to indulge in ferocious quarrels with whoever might cross his path. Violence of temper approaching to mania has been hereditary in the men of the family, and in my stepfather’s case it had, I believe, been intensified by his long residence in the tropics.”\n\n“Of his violent passions he has given repeated proofs, for he has no friends at all save the wandering gipsies, and he has a passion also for Indian animals. A cheetah and a baboon are at this moment roaming freely over his grounds, and they are feared by the villagers almost as much as their master. The house is a picture of gloom and desolation. The windows are broken, the walls are crumbling, the roof is partly caved in, and the whole place is ill-kept and neglected. The only servants we had were a couple of old women, who left us soon after our arrival, and since then my sister and I have had to do all the work of the house.”\n\n“Julia and I were twins, and we were only two years old when my mother remarried. She was of a sensitive nature, and she suffered much from the harshness of her stepfather. Two years ago, she met a half-pay major of marines, whom she became engaged to during a visit to our aunt, Miss Honoria Westphail, who lives near Harrow. My stepfather did not object to the match, but within a fortnight of the day which had been fixed for her marriage, the terrible event occurred which deprived me of my only companion.”",

In a fit of anger, however, caused by some robberies which had been perpetrated in the house, he beat his native butler to death and narrowly escaped a capital sentence. As it was, he suffered a long term of imprisonment and afterwards returned to England a morose and disappointed man.\n\n“When Dr. Roylott was in India he married my mother, Mrs. Stoner, the young widow of Major-General Stoner, of the Bengal Artillery.

But I have a good deal of experience in these little matters, and I have learned that there is nothing so unnatural as the commonplace.\"\n\nHe leaned forward and placed his long, thin fingers together, with his elbows on the arms of his chair. \"Let us consider the facts. The mud upon the left side of the trousers, the peculiar splashes, the angle at which they are thrown, all point to a dog-cart, and to the fact that you sat on the left-hand side of the driver. The rest is mere detail.\"\n\nI could not help laughing at the ease with which he explained his process. \"When I hear you give your reasons,\" I remarked, \"the thing always appears to me to be so ridiculously simple that I could easily do it myself, though at each successive instance of your reasoning I am baffled until you explain your process. And yet I believe that my eyes are as good as yours.\"\n\n\"Quite so,\" he answered, lighting a cigarette, and throwing himself down into an armchair. \"You see, but you do not observe. The distinction is clear. For example, you have frequently seen the steps which lead up from the hall to this room.\"\n\n\"Frequently.\"\n\n\"How often?\"\n\n\"Well, some hundreds of times.\"\n\n\"Then how many are there?\"\n\n\"How many? I don't know.\"\n\n\"Quite so! You have not observed. And yet you have seen. That is just my point. Now, I know that there are seventeen steps, because I have both seen and observed. By the way, since you are interested in these little problems, and since you are good enough to chronicle one or two of my trifling experiences, you may be interested in this.\"\n\nHe threw over a sheet of thick, pink-tinted notepaper which had been lying open upon the table. \"It came by the last post,\" said he. \"Read it aloud.\"\n\nThe note was undated, and without either signature or address.\n\n\"There will call upon you to-night, at a quarter to eight o'clock,\" it said, \"a gentleman who desires to consult you upon a matter of the very deepest moment. Your recent services to one of the royal houses of Europe have shown that you are one who may be safely trusted with matters which are of an importance which can hardly be exaggerated. This account of you we have from all quarters received. Be in your chamber then at that hour, and do not take it amiss if your visitor wears a mask.\"\n\n\"This is indeed a mystery,\" I remarked. \"What do you imagine that it means?\"\n\n\"I have no data yet. It is a capital mistake to theorize before one has data. Insensibly one begins to twist facts to suit theories, instead of theories to suit facts. But the note itself. What do you deduce from it?\"\n\nI carefully examined the writing, and the paper upon which it was written.\n\n\"The man who wrote it was presumably well to do,\" I remarked, endeavoring to imitate my companion's processes. \"Such paper could not be bought under half a crown a packet. It is peculiarly strong and stiff.\"\n\n\"Peculiar—that is the very word,\" said Holmes. \"It is not an English paper at all. Hold it up to the light.\"\n\nI did so, and saw a large \"E\" with a small \"g,\" a \"P,\" and a large \"G\" with a small \"t\" woven into the texture of the paper.\n\n\"What do you make of that?\" asked Holmes.\n\n\"The name of the maker, no doubt; or his monogram, rather.\"\n\n\"Not at all. The 'G' with the small 't' stands for 'Gesellschaft,' which is the German for 'Company.' It is a customary contraction like our 'Co.' 'P,' of course, stands for 'Papier.' Now for the 'Eg.' Let us glance at our Continental Gazetteer.\" He took down a heavy brown volume from his shelves. \"Eglow, Eglonitz—here we are, Egria. It is in a German-speaking country—in Bohemia, not far from Carlsbad. 'Remarkable as being the scene of the death of Wallenstein, and for its numerous glass-factories and paper-mills.' Ha, ha, my boy, what do you make of that?\" His eyes sparkled, and he sent up a great blue triumphant cloud from his cigarette.\n\n\"The paper was made in Bohemia,\" I said.\n\n\"Precisely. And the man who wrote the note is a German. Do you note the peculiar construction of the sentence—'This account of you we have from all quarters received.' A Frenchman or Russian could not have written that. It is the German who is so uncourteous to his verbs. It only remains, therefore, to discover what is wanted by this German who writes upon Bohemian paper and prefers wearing a mask to showing his face. And here he comes, if I am not mistaken, to resolve all our doubts.\"\n\nAs he spoke there was the sharp sound of horses' hoofs and grating wheels against the curb, followed by a sharp pull at the bell. Holmes whistled.\n\n\"A pair, by the sound,\" said he. \"Yes,\" he continued, glancing out of the window. \"A nice little brougham and a pair of beauties. A hundred and fifty guineas apiece. There's money in this case, Watson, if there is nothing else.\"\n\n\"I think that I had better go, Holmes.\"\n\n\"Not a bit, Doctor. Stay where you are. I am lost without my Boswell. And this promises to be interesting. It would be a pity to miss it.\"\n\n\"But your client—\"\n\n\"Never mind him. I may want your help, and so may he. Here he comes. Sit down in that armchair, Doctor, and give us your best attention.\"\n\nA slow and heavy step, which had been heard upon the stairs and in the passage, paused immediately outside the door. Then there was a loud and authoritative tap.\n\n\"Come in!\" said Holmes.\n\nA man entered who could hardly have been less than six feet six inches in height, with the chest and limbs of a Hercules. His dress was rich with a richness which would, in England, be looked upon as akin to bad taste. Heavy bands of astrakhan were slashed across the sleeves and fronts of his double-breasted coat, while the deep blue cloak which was thrown over his shoulders was lined with flame-coloured silk and secured at the neck with a brooch which consisted of a single flaming beryl. Boots which extended halfway up his calves, and which were trimmed at the tops with rich brown fur, completed the impression of barbaric opulence. He carried a broad-brimmed hat in his hand, while he wore across the upper part of his face, extending down past the cheekbones, a black vizard mask, which he had apparently adjusted that very moment, for his hand was still raised to it as he entered. From the lower part of the face he appeared to be a man of strong character, with a thick, hanging lip, and a long, straight chin, suggestive of resolution pushed to the length of obstinacy.\n\n\"You had my note?\" he asked, with a deep harsh voice and a strongly marked German accent. \"I told you that I would call.\""

That fatal night Dr. Roylott had gone to his room early, though we knew that he had not retired to rest, for my sister was troubled by the smell of the strong Indian cigars which it was his custom to smoke. She left her room, therefore, and came into mine, where she sat for some time, chatting about her approaching wedding. At eleven o’clock she rose to leave me, but she paused at the door and looked back.\n“‘Tell me, Helen,’ said she, ‘have you ever heard anyone whistle in the dead of the night?’\n“‘Never,’ said I.\n“‘I suppose that you could not possibly whistle, yourself, in your sleep?’\n“‘Certainly not. But why?’\n“‘Because during the last few nights I have always, about three in the morning, heard a low, clear whistle. I am a light sleeper, and it has awakened me. I cannot tell where it came from—perhaps from the next room, perhaps from the lawn. I thought that I would just ask you whether you had heard it.’\n“‘No, I have not. It must be those wretched gipsies in the plantation.’\n“‘Very likely. And yet if it were on the lawn, I wonder that you did not hear it also.’\n“‘Ah, but I sleep more heavily than you.’\n“‘Well, it is of no great consequence, at any rate.’ She smiled back at me, closed my door, and a few moments later I heard her key turn in the lock.”\n“Indeed,” said Holmes. “Was it your custom always to lock yourselves in at night?”\n“Always.”\n“And why?”\n“I think that I mentioned to you that the Doctor kept a cheetah and a baboon. We had no feeling of security unless our doors were locked.”\n“Quite so. Pray proceed with your statement.”\n“I could not sleep that night. A vague feeling of impending misfortune impressed me. My sister and I, you will recollect, were twins, and you know how subtle are the links which bind two souls which are so closely allied. It was a wild night. The wind was howling outside, and the rain was beating and splashing against the windows. Suddenly, amid all the hubbub of the gale, there burst forth the wild scream of a terrified woman. I knew that it was my sister’s voice. I sprang from my bed, wrapped a shawl round me, and rushed into the corridor. As I opened my door I seemed to hear a low whistle, such as my sister described, and a few moments later a clanging sound, as if a mass of metal had fallen. As I ran down the passage, my sister’s door was unlocked, and revolved slowly upon its hinges. I stared at it horror-stricken, not knowing what was about to issue from it. By the light of the corridor-lamp I saw my sister appear at the opening, her face blanched with terror, her hands groping for help, her whole figure swaying to and fro like that of a drunkard. I ran to her and threw my arms round her, but at that moment her knees seemed to give way and she fell to the ground. She writhed as one who is in terrible pain, and her limbs were dreadfully convulsed. At first I thought that she had not recognised me, but as I bent over her she suddenly shrieked out in a voice which I shall never forget, ‘Oh, my God! Helen! It was the band! The speckled band!’ There was something else which she would fain have said, and she stabbed with her finger into the air in the direction of the Doctor’s room, but a fresh convulsion seized her and choked her words. I rushed out, calling loudly for my stepfather, and I met him hastening from his room in his dressing-gown. When he reached my sister’s side she was unconscious, and though he poured brandy down her throat and sent for medical aid from the village, all efforts were in vain, for she slowly sank and died without having recovered her consciousness. Such was the dreadful end of my beloved sister.”\n“One moment,” said Holmes, “are you sure about this whistle and metallic sound? Could you swear to it?”\n“That was what the county coroner asked me at the inquiry. It is my strong impression that I heard it, and yet, among the crash of the gale and the creaking of an old house, I may possibly have been deceived.”\n“Was your sister dressed?”\n“No, she was in her night-dress. In her right hand was found the charred stump of a match, and in her left a match-box.”\n“Showing that she had struck a light and looked about her when the alarm took place. That is important. And what conclusions did the coroner come to?”\n“He investigated the case with great care, for Dr. Roylott’s conduct had long been notorious in the county, but he was unable to find any satisfactory cause of death. My evidence showed that the door had been fastened upon the inner side, and the windows were blocked by old-fashioned shutters with broad iron bars, which were secured every night. The walls were carefully sounded, and were shown to be quite solid all round, and the flooring was also thoroughly examined, with the same result. The chimney is wide, but is barred up by four large staples. It is certain, therefore, that my sister was quite alone when she met her end. Besides, there were no marks of any violence upon her.”\n“How about poison?”\n“The doctors examined her for it, but without success.”\n“What do you think that this unfortunate lady died of, then?”\n“It is my belief that she died of pure fear and nervous shock, though what it was that frightened her I cannot imagine.”\n“Were there gipsies in the plantation at the time?”\n“Yes, there are nearly always some there.”\n“Ah, and what did you gather from this allusion to a band—a speckled band?”\n“Sometimes I have thought that it was merely the wild talk of delirium, sometimes that it may have referred to some band of people, perhaps to these very gipsies in the plantation. I do not know whether the spotted handkerchiefs which so many of them wear over their heads might have suggested the strange adjective which she used.”\nHolmes shook his head like a man who is far from being satisfied.",

            "prefix-probing": "“Pray, be precise as to details,” said he.\n\nThe visitor, a man of middle height, strongly built, with a square black beard and pale, distinguished features, seemed to pull himself together with an effort. His manner was nervous and agitated, and he spoke in a low, hurried voice. “It is no ordinary crime that brings me here, Mr. Holmes,” he began. “I have been the victim of a most singular and inexplicable outrage.”\n\nHolmes inclined his head gravely. “I am at your service,” he said. “Pray, proceed.”\n\nThe man glanced anxiously at the closed door before continuing. “My name is Dr. John Openshaw. I reside at Horsham, in Sussex, and I have come to you because I have been unable to obtain any assistance from the local authorities. The matter is one of the utmost urgency, and I fear for my life.”\n\nHolmes’s eyes opened a little wider. “You interest me extremely, Dr. Openshaw. Please tell me everything, from the beginning.”\n\nDr. Openshaw drew a deep breath. “It began two years ago, when my uncle, Elias Openshaw, returned from America. He had lived there for many years, and when he came back to England he was a changed man—nervous, secretive, and always looking over his shoulder. He took up residence at our family estate and lived in almost complete seclusion. One morning, he received a letter postmarked from Pondicherry, India. Inside the envelope were five orange pips.”\n\nHolmes sat up a little straighter. “Five orange pips, you say? That is certainly unusual. What did your uncle make of it?”\n\n“He was visibly shaken,” Dr. Openshaw replied. “He locked himself in his room for hours, and when he emerged, he burned a number of papers in the fireplace. He would not speak of the matter, but I could see that he was deeply troubled. Within a week, he was dead—found drowned in the garden pond. The coroner returned a verdict of suicide, but I have always doubted it.”\n\nHolmes steepled his fingers and regarded his visitor intently. “And what happened next?”\n\n“After my uncle’s death, the estate passed to my father. He, too, received a letter with five orange pips, this time postmarked from Dundee. He laughed it off at first, but within a few days, he was found dead—killed in a fall from a cliff near our home. Again, the authorities ruled it an accident, but I am convinced that there is more to it.”\n\nHolmes’s expression grew grave. “And now you have received such a letter yourself?”\n\nDr. Openshaw nodded. “Three days ago, I found an envelope on my breakfast table. It contained five orange pips and a slip of paper with the letters ‘K.K.K.’ scrawled upon it. The postmark was from London. I am at my wits’ end, Mr. Holmes. I do not know what to do.”\n\nHolmes rose and paced the room thoughtfully. “This is indeed a most remarkable case. The recurrence of the orange pips and the initials ‘K.K.K.’ suggest a connection to the Ku Klux Klan, an organization notorious in America for its acts of violence and intimidation. Tell me, Dr. Openshaw, did your uncle have any enemies in America?”\n\n“I cannot say for certain,” Dr. Openshaw replied. “He was a planter in Florida during the war, and he spoke little of his time there. But I have always suspected that he was involved in some dark business.”\n\nHolmes nodded. “It is clear that the danger is real and imminent. You must take precautions. I will look into the matter at once. In the meantime, do not destroy any letters or papers you receive. They may provide valuable clues.”\n\nDr. Openshaw rose to his feet. “Thank you, Mr. Holmes. I feel better already, knowing that you are on the case.”\n\nHolmes smiled reassuringly. “Rest assured, I shall do all in my power to protect you. Good day, Dr. Openshaw.”\n\nWhen the visitor had departed, Holmes turned to me with a thoughtful expression. “What do you make of it, Watson?”\n\n“It is a most singular affair,” I replied. “The repetition of the orange pips and the deaths of both uncle and father suggest a deliberate pattern. The initials ‘K.K.K.’ are ominous indeed.”\n\n“Quite so,” Holmes agreed. “We must act quickly if we are to prevent another tragedy. Come, Watson, let us examine the letters more closely.”\n\nHe took the envelopes from the table and scrutinized them with his magnifying glass. “Note the handwriting, Watson—firm, angular, and American in style. The postmarks are from different locations, but the pattern is clear. The sender is moving about, perhaps to avoid detection.”\n\nHolmes sat down at his desk and began to make notes. “We must trace the movements of the sender. I shall send telegrams to my contacts in America and inquire about the Ku Klux Klan’s activities. In the meantime, we must keep Dr. Openshaw under close observation.”\n\nFor the next two days, Holmes was absorbed in his investigations. He received several telegrams in reply, but none provided any immediate leads. On the third day, however, a tragic event occurred. Dr. Openshaw was found dead in the Thames, apparently the victim of foul play.\n\nHolmes was deeply affected by the news. “I have failed, Watson,” he said bitterly. “If only I had acted more swiftly, perhaps I could have saved him.”\n\nI tried to console him, but he would not be comforted. “There is still a chance to bring the perpetrators to justice,” he said grimly. “We must not rest until we have done so.”\n\nHolmes redoubled his efforts, and after several days of tireless investigation, he succeeded in identifying the men responsible for the crimes. They were members of the Ku Klux Klan who had followed Elias Openshaw to England, seeking revenge for some past grievance.\n\nHolmes arranged for their arrest, and justice was finally served. Though he could not save Dr. Openshaw, he took some comfort in knowing that he had brought the murderers to account.\n\nAs we sat together in our rooms at Baker Street, Holmes reflected on the case. “It is a reminder, Watson, that even the most careful and intelligent men can fall victim to forces beyond their control. We must always be vigilant, and never underestimate the power of evil.”\n\nI nodded in agreement, and we sat in silence, each lost in our own thoughts."

          "text_segment": "“These are very deep waters,” said he; “pray go on with your narrative.”\n“Two years have passed since then, and my life has been until lately lonelier than ever. A month ago, however, a dear friend, whom I have known for many years, has done me the honour to ask my hand in marriage. His name is Armitage—Percy Armitage—the second son of Mr. Armitage, of Crane Water, near Reading. My stepfather has offered no opposition to the match, and we are to be married in the course of the spring. Two days ago some repairs were started in the west wing of the building, and my bedroom wall has been pierced, so that I have had to move into the chamber in which my sister died, and to sleep in the very bed in which she slept. Imagine, then, my thrill of terror when last night, as I lay awake, thinking over her terrible fate, I suddenly heard in the silence of the night the low whistle which had been the herald of her own death. I sprang up and lit the lamp, but nothing was to be seen in the room. I was too shaken to go to bed again, however, so I dressed, and as soon as it was daylight I slipped down, got a dog-cart at the Crown Inn, which is opposite, and drove to Leatherhead, from whence I have come on this morning with the one object of seeing you and asking your advice.”\n“You have done wisely,” said my friend. “But have you told me all?”\n“Yes, all.”\n“Miss Roylott, you have not. You are screening your stepfather.”\n“Why, what do you mean?”\nFor answer Holmes pushed back the frill of black lace which fringed the hand that lay upon our visitor’s knee. Five little livid spots, the marks of four fingers and a thumb, were printed upon the white wrist.\n“You have been cruelly used,” said Holmes.\nThe lady coloured deeply and covered over her injured wrist. “He is a hard man,” she said, “and perhaps he hardly knows his own strength.”\nThere was a long silence, during which Holmes leaned his chin upon his hands and stared into the crackling fire.\n“This is a very deep business,” he said at last. “There are a thousand details which I should desire to know before I decide upon our course of action. Yet we have not a moment to lose. If we were to come to Stoke Moran to-day, would it be possible for us to see over these rooms without the knowledge of your stepfather?”\n“As it happens, he spoke of coming into town to-day upon some most important business. It is probable that he will be away all day, and that there would be nothing to disturb you. We have a housekeeper now, but she is old and foolish, and I could easily get her out of the way.”\n“Excellent. You are not averse to this trip, Watson?”\n“By no means.”\n“Then we shall both come. What are you going to do yourself?”\n“I have one or two things which I would wish to do now that I am in town. But I shall return by the twelve o’clock train, so as to be there in time for your coming.”\n“And you may expect us early in the afternoon. I have myself some small business matters to attend to. Will you not wait and breakfast?”\n“No, I must go. My heart is lightened already since I have confided my trouble to you. I shall look forward to seeing you again this afternoon.” She dropped her thick black veil over her face and glided from the room.",

A month ago, however, a dear friend, whom I have known for many years, has done me the honour to ask my hand in marriage. His name is Armitage—Percy Armitage—the second son of Mr. Armitage, of Crane Water, near Reading. My stepfather has offered no opposition to the match, and we are to be married in the course of the spring. Two days ago some repairs were started in the west wing of the building, and my bedroom wall has been pierced, so that I had to move into the chamber in which my sister died, and to sleep in the very bed in which she slept. Imagine my terror when last night, as I lay awake, thinking over her terrible fate, I suddenly heard in the silence of the night the low whistle which had been the herald of her own death. I sprang up and lit the lamp, but nothing was to be seen in the room. I was too shaken to go to bed again, however, so I dressed, and as soon as it was daylight I slipped down, got a dog-cart at the Crown Inn, which is opposite, and drove to Leatherhead. From there I came on by the early train to Waterloo, and so to you.”\n\nHolmes shook his head like a man who is far from being satisfied.\n\n“My dear Miss Stoner,” said he, “are you sure that you have told me everything?”\n\n“Absolutely everything that I can remember.”\n\n“Yet you have not mentioned to me that when you sat down to breakfast this morning you were already in possession of the facts that you have just told me.”\n\nHelen blushed and seemed confused. “I did not know how much I ought to tell. I was afraid that I might seem to be betraying my stepfather. He is a hard man, and perhaps he hardly knows his own strength.”\n\nAs she spoke she raised her sleeve and showed us five little livid spots, the marks of four fingers and a thumb upon her white wrist.\n\n“You have been cruelly used,” said Holmes.\n\n“The matter is very serious,” he continued. “If you can arrange that we may look over these rooms without the knowledge of your stepfather, I shall be glad to come.”\n\n“I can easily manage that,” she answered. “He is to be in town all day, and I shall be able to see that the housekeeper is out of the way. You may expect us early in the afternoon.”\n\n“Excellent. You are not adverse to this, Watson?”\n\n“Not at all.”\n\n“Then we shall both come. You may rely upon us.”\n\nShe rose, and I saw that her face was more composed than it had been when she entered. The adventure was a strange one, but I could see that Holmes was as keen as ever upon it. As for myself, I was already deeply interested in the case, and only too anxious to see the rooms in which the tragedy had occurred.\n\n“Will you not stay and have breakfast?” asked Holmes.\n\n“No, I must go back. I shall be more at ease when I have told you everything. I shall be at Stoke Moran before midday.”\n\nWith a grateful glance at us both, she passed swiftly from the room.",

            "prefix-probing": "I smiled at his remark, for I had indeed been somewhat discursive in my account, anxious as I was to lay before him every detail, however trivial, that might bear upon the curious case which had so recently come to my attention. Holmes, with his keen, hawk-like gaze, leaned forward in his armchair, his long, slender fingers steepled before him, and his eyes fixed upon me with that singular intensity which always bespoke the working of his remarkable mind.\n\n“Very well,” I continued, “I shall endeavour to be as concise as possible. As I mentioned, the letter arrived by the morning post, and its contents were of such a nature that I felt compelled to seek your advice without delay. The handwriting was unfamiliar, but the tone was urgent, almost desperate. The writer, a certain Miss Violet Hunter, requested an interview at the earliest possible moment, hinting at circumstances of a most unusual and pressing character.”\n\nHolmes nodded, his interest evidently piqued. “Miss Violet Hunter,” he repeated. “Pray, what more do you know of her?”\n\n“Very little, I confess,” I replied. “She is a governess by profession, and her references, as far as I have been able to ascertain, are impeccable. She has been employed in several respectable households, and her character is above reproach. It was the singularity of her request, rather than any suspicion of impropriety, that led me to bring the matter to your attention.”\n\nHolmes tapped his fingers together thoughtfully. “And what, precisely, did she say in her letter?”\n\nI drew the missive from my pocket and handed it to him. He unfolded it with care and read it through, his lips moving silently as he absorbed the contents. When he had finished, he laid it upon the table and regarded me with a look of quiet satisfaction.\n\n“It is as I thought,” he said. “The case promises to be one of considerable interest. The mention of the copper beeches, the peculiar stipulations regarding her dress and appearance, and the generous salary offered—all these point to a situation out of the common run. Did Miss Hunter give any indication of her own feelings in the matter?”\n\n“She expressed a certain uneasiness,” I replied. “She is not without courage, but the very strangeness of the proposal has unsettled her. She fears, perhaps, that there is more to the matter than meets the eye.”\n\n“Quite so,” said Holmes. “And rightly so. There is, I suspect, some hidden motive behind these unusual conditions. It is our task to discover what that motive may be. Did she mention when she would call upon us?”\n\n“She proposed to come this afternoon, if that would be convenient.”\n\nHolmes glanced at the clock upon the mantelpiece. “Then we have but a short time to wait. In the meantime, let us consider what we know. The employer, Mr. Rucastle, is evidently a man of means, but his requirements are most singular. The insistence upon the cutting of the hair, the wearing of a particular dress, the restriction of movement within the house—these are not the demands of a rational man. There is, I fear, some sinister purpose at work.”\n\nI could not but agree with his assessment. The more I reflected upon the matter, the more convinced I became that Miss Hunter had acted wisely in seeking Holmes’s counsel. The minutes passed in silence, each of us absorbed in our own thoughts, until at last the bell rang and the parlour-maid announced the arrival of Miss Violet Hunter herself.\n\nShe entered the room with a quiet dignity, her manner composed but her eyes betraying a certain apprehension. Holmes rose to greet her, his manner courteous but direct.\n\n“Pray be seated, Miss Hunter,” he said. “Dr. Watson has already acquainted me with the general outline of your case, but I should be glad to hear the particulars from your own lips.”\n\nThus invited, Miss Hunter began her narrative, her voice steady but tinged with anxiety as she recounted the strange events which had led her to seek the aid of Sherlock Holmes."

It is precisely for that reason that we are going to Stoke Moran this day. I want to see whether the objections are fatal, or if they may be explained away. But what in the name of the devil!”\nThe ejaculation had been drawn from my companion by the fact that our door had been suddenly dashed open, and that a huge man had framed himself in the aperture. His costume was a peculiar mixture of the professional and of the agricultural, having a black top-hat, a long frock-coat, and a pair of high gaiters, with a hunting-crop swinging in his hand. So tall was he that his hat actually brushed the cross bar of the doorway, and his breadth seemed to span it across from side to side. A large face, seared with a thousand wrinkles, burned yellow with the sun, and marked with every evil passion, was turned from one to the other of us, while his deep-set, bile-shot eyes, and his high, thin, fleshless nose, gave him somewhat the resemblance to a fierce old bird of prey.\n“Which of you is Holmes?” asked this apparition.\n“My name, sir; but you have the advantage of me,” said my companion quietly.\n“I am Dr. Grimesby Roylott, of Stoke Moran.”\n“Indeed, Doctor,” said Holmes blandly. “Pray take a seat.”\n“I will do nothing of the kind. My stepdaughter has been here. I have traced her. What has she been saying to you?”\n“It is a little cold for the time of the year,” said Holmes.\n“What has she been saying to you?” screamed the old man furiously.\n“But I have heard that the crocuses promise well,” continued my companion imperturbably.\n“Ha! You put me off, do you?” said our new visitor, taking a step forward and shaking his hunting-crop. “I know you, you scoundrel! I have heard of you before. You are Holmes, the meddler.”\nMy friend smiled.\n“Holmes, the busybody!”\nHis smile broadened.\n“Holmes, the Scotland Yard Jack-in-office!”\nHolmes chuckled heartily. “Your conversation is most entertaining,” said he. “When you go out close the door, for there is a decided draught.”\n“I will go when I have had my say. Don’t you dare to meddle with my affairs. I know that Miss Stoner has been here. I traced her! I am a dangerous man to fall foul of! See here.” He stepped swiftly forward, seized the poker, and bent it into a curve with his huge brown hands.\n“See that you keep yourself out of my grip,” he snarled, and hurling the twisted poker into the fireplace he strode out of the room.\n“He seems a very amiable person,” said Holmes, laughing. “I am not quite so bulky, but if he had remained I might have shown him that my grip was not much more feeble than his own.” As he spoke he picked up the steel poker and, with a sudden effort, straightened it out again.\n“Fancy his having the insolence to confound me with the official detective force! This incident gives zest to our investigation, however, and I only trust that our little friend will not suffer from her imprudence in allowing this brute to trace her. And now, Watson, we shall order breakfast, and afterwards I shall walk down to Doctors’ Commons, where I hope to get some data which may help us in this matter.”",

              "simple_agent_extraction": "“And what do you think of it all, Watson?” asked Sherlock Holmes, leaning back in his chair.\n\n“I cannot see anything in it to reflect credit upon myself,” I answered. “The case is a very dark one, and the facts are very meagre.”\n\n“The surprise is the more remarkable since the facts are so slight,” replied Holmes. “I cannot recall any case within my experience which looked at the first glance so simple and yet which presented such difficulties. The statement of the case, as given by Miss Stoner, is briefly this: Her sister died in her room, the door and window being fastened on the inside. The bed was in the centre of the room, and she died in the middle of the night, uttering a cry of ‘The speckled band!’ The only clue which she can furnish is the dying allusion to a band, and the fact that she heard a low whistle in the dead of the night. These are the main facts. Now, let us see what are the points in favour of the theory of the gipsies, and what are those against it.”\n\n“The gipsies!” I exclaimed. “How came they into the matter?”\n\n“As a matter of fact, Dr. Roylott’s family was at one time among the richest in England, and the gipsies have been permitted to encamp on the grounds. Miss Stoner’s allusion to the band may have been a reference to these wanderers, who are in the habit of wearing bands of various hues upon their heads. The other point is the whistle. The gipsies are known to use whistles for their own purposes. The fact that Dr. Roylott has a motive for preventing his stepdaughter’s marriage is clear enough. The metallic clang may have been caused by the shutting of the window, or by the falling of a bar. Altogether, it seems to me to be a most dark and sinister business.”\n\n“Indeed, it is so,” said I. “But if the room was locked and the window fastened, how could any one have got in?”\n\n“That is the problem which we have to solve. There are several objections to the theory which I have stated, and we shall have to test them by a direct examination of the premises. I think that we shall do well to go to Stoke Moran to-morrow.”\n\nI had hardly finished my breakfast when Holmes’s attention was arrested by a loud and sudden noise. The door had been flung open, and a huge man had entered. He was dressed in a professional but rather untidy manner, and his face was marked with every evil passion.

What has she been saying to you?”\n\n“It is a little cold for the time of the year,” said Holmes.\n\n“What has she been saying to you?” screamed the old man furiously.\n\n“But I have heard that the crocuses promise well,” continued my companion imperturbably.\n\n“Ha! You put me off, do you?” said Dr. Roylott, taking a step forward. “But I know you, you scoundrel! I have heard of you before. You are Holmes, the meddler.”\n\nMy friend smiled.\n\n“Holmes, the busybody!”\n\nHis smile broadened.\n\n“Holmes, the Scotland Yard jack-in-office!”\n\nHolmes chuckled heartily. “Your conversation is most entertaining,” said he. “When you go out close the door, for there is a decided draught.”\n\n“I will go when I have had my say. Don’t you dare to meddle with my affairs. I know that Miss Stoner has been here. I am a dangerous man to fall foul of.

I shall have to look up his record. In the meantime, we may as well straighten things up a bit.” He picked up the poker, and with a sudden effort straightened it out again.\n\n“Fancy his having the insolence to confound me with the official detective force!

                "text": "“And what do you think of it all, Watson?” asked Sherlock Holmes, leaning back in his chair.\n\n“I cannot see anything in it to reflect credit upon myself,” I answered. “The case is a very dark one, and the facts are very meagre.”\n\n“The surprise is the more remarkable since the facts are so slight,” replied Holmes. “I cannot recall any case within my experience which looked at the first glance so simple and yet which presented such difficulties. The statement of the case, as given by Miss Stoner, is briefly this: Her sister died in her room, the door and window being fastened on the inside. The bed was in the centre of the room, and she died in the middle of the night, uttering a cry of ‘The speckled band!’ The only clue which she can furnish is the dying allusion to a band, and the fact that she heard a low whistle in the dead of the night. These are the main facts. Now, let us see what are the points in favour of the theory of the gipsies, and what are those against it.”\n\n“The gipsies!” I exclaimed. “How came they into the matter?”\n\n“As a matter of fact, Dr. Roylott’s family was at one time among the richest in England, and the gipsies have been permitted to encamp on the grounds. Miss Stoner’s allusion to the band may have been a reference to these wanderers, who are in the habit of wearing bands of various hues upon their heads. The other point is the whistle. The gipsies are known to use whistles for their own purposes. The fact that Dr. Roylott has a motive for preventing his stepdaughter’s marriage is clear enough. The metallic clang may have been caused by the shutting of the window, or by the falling of a bar. Altogether, it seems to me to be a most dark and sinister business.”\n\n“Indeed, it is so,” said I. “But if the room was locked and the window fastened, how could any one have got in?”\n\n“That is the problem which we have to solve. There are several objections to the theory which I have stated, and we shall have to test them by a direct examination of the premises. I think that we shall do well to go to Stoke Moran to-morrow.”\n\nI had hardly finished my breakfast when Holmes’s attention was arrested by a loud and sudden noise. The door had been flung open, and a huge man had entered. He was dressed in a professional but rather untidy manner, and his face was marked with every evil passion. His deep-set, bile-shot eyes, and the high, thin, fleshless nose, gave him somewhat the resemblance to a fierce old bird of prey.\n\n“Which of you is Holmes?” asked this apparition.\n\n“My name, sir; but you have the advantage of me,” said my companion quietly.\n\n“I am Dr. Grimesby Roylott, of Stoke Moran.”\n\n“Indeed, Doctor,” said Holmes blandly. “Pray take a seat.”\n\n“I will do nothing of the kind.

I think that we should go to-day.”\n\nIt was not yet nine o’clock when we reached Baker Street, but Holmes had already been up for some time, and had breakfasted. He was seated in his favourite armchair, clad in his dressing-gown, and was deep in thought. Suddenly there was a sharp sound of horses’ hoofs and grating wheels against the curb, followed by a violent peal at the bell. Holmes rose and stood motionless, with the expression of a set and eager man upon his face. The door opened, and a huge man entered. He was dressed in a long frock-coat, and carried a black top-hat in his hand. He was so tall that his hat actually brushed the cross bar of the doorway, and so broad that he seemed to fill it. His face was seared with lines of passion, and his deep-set, bile-shot eyes, and the high, thin, fleshless nose, gave him somewhat the resemblance to a fierce old bird of prey.\n\n“Which of you is Holmes?” asked he.\n\n“My name, sir; but you have the advantage of me,” said my companion quietly.\n\n“I am Dr. Grimesby Roylott, of Stoke Moran.”\n\n“Indeed, Doctor,” said Holmes blandly. “Pray take a seat.”\n\n“I will do nothing of the kind.

            "prefix-probing": "“It is a most mysterious business,” I replied. “I cannot see that there is anything in it to suggest a clue—perhaps the very absence of a clue is itself a clue. You have, I suppose, formed some theory?”\n\n“No doubt I have my own ideas,” said Holmes, smiling. “But I should like to hear your impressions.”\n\n“I confess that I am baffled,” I said. “The facts seem to me to be so disconnected. The letter, the singular request, the strange visitor—each is curious in itself, but I cannot see how they fit together.”\n\nHolmes chuckled softly. “You see, but you do not observe. The distinction is clear. For example, you have frequently seen the steps which lead up from the hall to this room.”\n\n“Frequently.”\n\n“How often?”\n\n“Well, some hundreds of times.”\n\n“Then how many are there?”\n\n“How many? I don’t know.”\n\n“Quite so! You have not observed. And yet you have seen. That is just my point. Now, I know that there are seventeen steps, because I have both seen and observed. By the same process, I can draw certain conclusions from the facts before us.”\n\n“But what do you make of the visitor’s manner?” I asked. “He seemed nervous, almost agitated.”\n\n“Precisely. And that is significant. A man does not come to Baker Street at this hour unless he is deeply troubled. His agitation was not feigned. It was the agitation of a man who has been driven to the last extremity.”\n\n“And the letter?”\n\nHolmes took up the sheet of paper from the table and held it up to the light. “It is a curious document. The paper is of excellent quality, but the handwriting is peculiar. It is disguised, of course, but not so cleverly as to defy analysis. The writer is evidently educated, but anxious to conceal his identity.”\n\n“Do you think it is a woman’s hand?”\n\n“No, I should say not. The strokes are too bold, the pressure too heavy. It is the hand of a man accustomed to wielding a pen, but not for literary purposes. Perhaps a lawyer, or a clerk.”\n\n“And the contents?”\n\n“Ah, there you touch upon the most singular point. The request is so unusual that it must have a very special reason behind it. Why should a man ask for our assistance in such a roundabout way? Why not come directly to the point?”\n\n“Perhaps he fears to commit himself.”\n\n“Exactly. He wishes to test us, to see if we are worthy of his confidence. That in itself is suggestive. It tells us that the matter is one of great delicacy, perhaps even of danger.”\n\nI leaned forward, my interest aroused. “And what do you propose to do?”\n\n“Nothing, for the moment. We must wait for further developments. The game is afoot, but the first move is not ours. We must be patient.”\n\nAs he spoke, there was a sharp rap at the door. Mrs. Hudson entered with a card upon a tray.\n\n“A visitor for you, sir,” she said.\n\nHolmes took the card and glanced at it. “Show him up, please.”\n\nA moment later, our client entered. He was a man of middle height, with a pale, anxious face and restless eyes. He glanced nervously about the room before taking the seat which Holmes indicated.\n\n“You have come, I perceive, upon a matter of some importance,” said Holmes, with his usual courtesy. “Pray, be seated and tell us how we may be of service to you.”\n\nThe man hesitated for a moment, as if collecting his thoughts. Then he began, in a low, hurried voice:\n\n“My name is John Openshaw. I have come to you because I do not know where else to turn. My case is a most extraordinary one, and I am in great fear for my life.”\n\nHolmes leaned forward, his eyes shining with interest. “Pray proceed, Mr. Openshaw.”\n\n“It is a long story, and I must begin at the beginning. My uncle, Elias Openshaw, emigrated to America as a young man and made a considerable fortune in the South. He returned to England after the war, and settled at Horsham, in Sussex. He was a man of strange habits, very reserved, and he lived alone in a large house, attended only by an old servant. I was his only relative in England, and he took a great interest in me.”\n\nHe paused for a moment, as if overcome by emotion. Holmes nodded encouragingly.\n\n“In 1883, a curious incident occurred. My uncle received a letter, posted from Pondicherry, in India. It contained only five little orange pips. He was much agitated by it, but would say nothing of its meaning. A few days later, he made his will, leaving all his property to me. Within a week, he was found dead in his garden, his face contorted with terror. The coroner’s verdict was ‘death by misadventure,’ but I have always believed that he died of sheer fright.”\n\nHolmes listened intently, his fingers steepled beneath his chin. “And what happened then?”\n\n“Two years later, my father received a similar letter, also containing five orange pips. He laughed at it, but within a few days he was drowned in a deep pool on our estate. The verdict was again ‘accidental death,’ but I cannot believe it was a coincidence.”\n\n“And now you have received such a letter yourself?”\n\n“Yes. Three days ago. It was posted from East London, and contained the same five orange pips. The envelope bore the initials ‘K.K.K.’”\n\nHolmes’s eyes gleamed. “You have certainly come to the right place, Mr. Openshaw. I shall do all that is in my power to help you. But you must tell me every detail, however trivial it may seem.”\n\nMr. Openshaw nodded, and began to recount the strange events which had brought him to our door. As he spoke, I could see that Holmes was already piecing together the threads of the mystery, his keen mind working with its usual precision. I sat back in my chair, content to watch the master at work, and to marvel once more at the extraordinary powers of observation and deduction which had made Sherlock Holmes the greatest detective of his age."

He held in his hand a sheet of blue paper, scrawled over with notes and figures.\n“I have seen the will of the deceased wife,” said he. “To determine its exact meaning I have been obliged to work out the present prices of the investments with which it is concerned. The total income, which at the time of the wife’s death was little short of £ 1,100, is now, through the fall in agricultural prices, not more than £ 750. Each daughter can claim an income of £ 250, in case of marriage. It is evident, therefore, that if both girls had married, this beauty would have had a mere pittance, while even one of them would cripple him to a very serious extent. My morning’s work has not been wasted, since it has proved that he has the very strongest motives for standing in the way of anything of the sort. And now, Watson, this is too serious for dawdling, especially as the old man is aware that we are interesting ourselves in his affairs; so if you are ready, we shall call a cab and drive to Waterloo. I should be very much obliged if you would slip your revolver into your pocket. An Eley’s No. 2 is an excellent argument with gentlemen who can twist steel pokers into knots. That and a tooth-brush are, I think, all that we need.”\nAt Waterloo we were fortunate in catching a train for Leatherhead, where we hired a trap at the station inn and drove for four or five miles through the lovely Surrey lanes. It was a perfect day, with a bright sun and a few fleecy clouds in the heavens. The trees and wayside hedges were just throwing out their first green shoots, and the air was full of the pleasant smell of the moist earth. To me at least there was a strange contrast between the sweet promise of the spring and this sinister quest upon which we were engaged. My companion sat in the front of the trap, his arms folded, his hat pulled down over his eyes, and his chin sunk upon his breast, buried in the deepest thought. Suddenly, however, he started, tapped me on the shoulder, and pointed over the meadows.\n“Look there!” said he.\nA heavily timbered park stretched up in a gentle slope, thickening into a grove at the highest point. From amid the branches there jutted out the grey gables and high roof-tree of a very old mansion.\n“Stoke Moran?” said he.\n“Yes, sir, that be the house of Dr. Grimesby Roylott,” remarked the driver.\n“There is some building going on there,” said Holmes; “that is where we are going.”\n“There’s the village,” said the driver, pointing to a cluster of roofs some distance to the left; “but if you want to get to the house, you’ll find it shorter to get over this stile, and so by the footpath over the fields. There it is, where the lady is walking.”\n“And the lady, I fancy, is Miss Stoner,” observed Holmes, shading his eyes. “Yes, I think we had better do as you suggest.”\nWe got off, paid our fare, and the trap rattled back on its way to Leatherhead.\n“I thought it as well,” said Holmes as we climbed the stile, “that this fellow should think we had come here as architects, or on some definite business. It may stop his gossip. Good-afternoon, Miss Stoner. You see that we have been as good as our word.”\nOur client of the morning had hurried forward to meet us with a face which spoke her joy. “I have been waiting so eagerly for you,” she cried, shaking hands with us warmly. “All has turned out splendidly. Dr. Roylott has gone to town, and it is unlikely that he will be back before evening.”\n“We have had the pleasure of making the Doctor’s acquaintance,” said Holmes, and in a few words he sketched out what had occurred. Miss Stoner turned white to the lips as she listened.\n“Good heavens!” she cried, “he has followed me, then.”\n“So it appears.”\n“He is so cunning that I never know when I am safe from him. What will he say when he returns?”\n“He must guard himself, for he may find that there is someone more cunning than himself upon his track. You must lock yourself up from him to-night. If he is violent, we shall take you away to your aunt’s at Harrow. Now, we must make the best use of our time, so kindly take us at once to the rooms which we are to examine.”",

            "prefix-probing": "He held in his hand a sheet of blue paper, scrawled over with notes and figures.\n\n\"I have seen the will of the deceased,\" said he. \"You remember, of course, that it was in the possession of the lawyer, Mr. Turner. Well, I have had a chat with him, and I have also spent some time at the police station. Nothing new has transpired, but I have learned a good deal which may be of use to us.\"\n\n\"You have not visited the scene of the crime yet?\" I asked.\n\n\"Not yet. I thought I would see you first and get your impressions.\"\n\n\"I have seen everything that is to be seen.\"\n\n\"And what do you think?\"\n\n\"It was a most extraordinary case.\"\n\n\"That is the very word. But I fancy that I see my way to clearing it up.\"\n\n\"You have formed a theory, then?\"\n\n\"At least I have formed a hypothesis. It is a capital mistake to theorize before one has data. Insensibly one begins to twist facts to suit theories, instead of theories to suit facts. But I have all the data now. I shall go down to the house presently and make a few investigations.\"\n\n\"I shall come with you.\"\n\n\"I do not wish to prevent you. Dr. Watson, I should be very glad of your company.\"\n\nWe set off together, and made our way to the scene of the tragedy. The house was a large, rambling building, standing back from the road, and surrounded by a high brick wall. As we approached, a police constable, who was on duty at the gate, saluted us and let us in. We found the family in the drawing-room, but Holmes asked to be shown at once to the room where the crime had been committed.\n\nIt was a large, plainly furnished apartment, with a broad window looking out upon the garden. The furniture was old-fashioned and substantial. Holmes went carefully over the whole room, examining the carpet, the furniture, and the window. He knelt down and scrutinized the floor with his magnifying glass, and then examined the window-latch. He opened the window and looked out.\n\n\"You see,\" he remarked, \"the window is at least six feet from the ground, and there are no marks upon the sill. It would be a difficult matter for anyone to enter or leave by this window.\"\n\nHe then turned his attention to the writing-table, upon which lay a number of papers. He examined them carefully, but apparently found nothing of importance. He then turned to the door, and examined the lock and the keyhole.\n\n\"The door was locked on the inside, was it not?\" he asked.\n\n\"Yes,\" I replied. \"The key was found in the lock.\"\n\n\"And the window was fastened on the inside?\"\n\n\"Yes.\"\n\n\"Then it is clear that no one could have entered or left the room except by the door.\"\n\nHe stood for some minutes in deep thought, then turned to me with a smile.\n\n\"Well, Watson, what do you make of it?\"\n\n\"It is a most mysterious affair.\"\n\n\"Yes, it is indeed. But I think that we shall be able to clear it up. There are one or two points which are still obscure, but I hope to be able to elucidate them before long.\"\n\nHe then made a careful examination of the body, which had not yet been removed. He noted the position of the wounds, and the direction in which the blood had flowed. He then examined the hands and the clothing of the deceased.\n\n\"There is one thing which is very remarkable,\" he said. \"The absence of any weapon. The wounds could only have been inflicted by a sharp instrument, yet no such instrument has been found.\"\n\n\"It is possible that the murderer carried it away with him.\"\n\n\"That is possible. But it is also possible that the weapon is still in the room. We must search carefully.\"\n\nHe then proceeded to make a thorough search of the room, examining every possible hiding-place. At last, with an exclamation of satisfaction, he drew a small, blood-stained knife from behind a curtain.\n\n\"Here is the weapon,\" he said. \"It was cleverly concealed, but not cleverly enough to escape my notice.\"\n\nHe then turned to the police inspector, who had entered the room.\n\n\"I think, Inspector,\" he said, \"that you will find the solution of this mystery is not so difficult as it appears. The murderer is someone who was well acquainted with the house, and who had a motive for the crime. I shall be able to give you his name before the day is out.\"\n\nWith these words, he left the room, and I followed him. As we walked down the corridor, he turned to me with a smile.\n\n\"Well, Watson,\" he said, \"what do you think of the case now?\"\n\n\"It is certainly a most interesting one.\"\n\n\"Yes, and I think that we shall be able to bring it to a successful conclusion. But there is still much to be done. Come, let us return to Baker Street and see what further information we can obtain.\""

          "text_segment": "The building was of grey, lichen-blotched stone, with a high central portion and two curving wings, like the claws of a crab, thrown out on each side. In one of these wings the windows were broken and blocked with wooden boards, while the roof was partly caved in, a picture of ruin. The central portion was in little better repair, but the right-hand block was comparatively modern, and the blinds in the windows, with the blue smoke curling up from the chimneys, showed that this was where the family resided. Some scaffolding had been erected against the end wall, and the stone-work had been broken into, but there were no signs of any workmen at the moment of our visit. Holmes walked slowly up and down the ill-trimmed lawn and examined with deep attention the outsides of the windows.\n“This, I take it, belongs to the room in which you used to sleep, the centre one to your sister’s, and the one next to the main building to Dr. Roylott’s chamber?”\n“Exactly so. But I am now sleeping in the middle one.”\n“Pending the alterations, as I understand. By the way, there does not seem to be any very pressing need for repairs at that end wall.”\n“There were none. I believe that it was an excuse to move me from my room.”\n“Ah! that is suggestive. Now, on the other side of this narrow wing runs the corridor from which these three rooms open. There are windows in it, of course?”\n“Yes, but very small ones. Too narrow for anyone to pass through.”\n“As you both locked your doors at night, your rooms were unapproachable from that side. Now, would you have the kindness to go into your room and bar your shutters?”\nMiss Stoner did so, and Holmes, after a careful examination through the open window, endeavoured in every way to force the shutter open, but without success. There was no slit through which a knife could be passed to raise the bar. Then with his lens he tested the hinges, but they were of solid iron, built firmly into the massive masonry. “Hum!” said he, scratching his chin in some perplexity, “my theory certainly presents some difficulties. No one could pass these shutters if they were bolted. Well, we shall see if the inside throws any light upon the matter.”\nA small side door led into the whitewashed corridor from which the three bedrooms opened. Holmes refused to examine the third chamber, so we passed at once to the second, that in which Miss Stoner was now sleeping, and in which her sister had met with her fate. It was a homely little room, with a low ceiling and a gaping fireplace, after the fashion of old country-houses. A brown chest of drawers stood in one corner, a narrow white-counterpaned bed in another, and a dressing-table on the left-hand side of the window. These articles, with two small wicker-work chairs, made up all the furniture in the room save for a square of Wilton carpet in the centre. The boards round and the panelling of the walls were of brown, worm-eaten oak, so old and discoloured that it may have dated from the original building of the house. Holmes drew one of the chairs into a corner and sat silent, while his eyes travelled round and round and up and down, taking in every detail of the apartment.\n“Where does that bell communicate with?” he asked at last pointing to a thick bell-rope which hung down beside the bed, the tassel actually lying upon the pillow.\n“It goes to the housekeeper’s room.”\n“It looks newer than the other things?”\n“Yes, it was only put there a couple of years ago.”\n“Your sister asked for it, I suppose?”\n“No, I never heard of her using it. We used always to get what we wanted for ourselves.”\n“Indeed, it seemed unnecessary to put so nice a bell-pull there. You will excuse me for a few minutes while I satisfy myself as to this floor.” He threw himself down upon his face with his lens in his hand and crawled swiftly backward and forward, examining minutely the cracks between the boards. Then he did the same with the wood-work with which the chamber was panelled. Finally he walked over to the bed and spent some time in staring at it and in running his eye up and down the wall. Finally he took the bell-rope in his hand and gave it a brisk tug.\n“Why, it’s a dummy,” said he.\n“Won’t it ring?”\n“No, it is not even attached to a wire. This is very interesting. You can see now that it is fastened to a hook just above where the little opening for the ventilator is.”\n“How very absurd! I never noticed that before.”\n“Very strange!” muttered Holmes, pulling at the rope. “There are one or two very singular points about this room. For example, what a fool a builder must be to open a ventilator into another room, when, with the same trouble, he might have communicated with the outside air!”\n“That is also quite modern,” said the lady.\n“Done about the same time as the bell-rope?” remarked Holmes.\n“Yes, there were several little changes carried out about that time.”\n“They seem to have been of a most interesting character—dummy bell-ropes, and ventilators which do not ventilate. With your permission, Miss Stoner, we shall now carry our researches into the inner apartment.”\nDr. Grimesby Roylott’s chamber was larger than that of his step-daughter, but was as plainly furnished. A camp-bed, a small wooden shelf full of books, mostly of a technical character, an armchair beside the bed, a plain wooden chair against the wall, a round table, and a large iron safe were the principal things which met the eye. Holmes walked slowly round and examined each and all of them with the keenest interest.\n“What’s in here?” he asked, tapping the safe.\n“My stepfather’s business papers.”\n“Oh! you have seen inside, then?”\n“Only once, some years ago. I remember that it was full of papers.”\n“There isn’t a cat in it, for example?”\n“No. What a strange idea!”\n“Well, look at this!” He took up a small saucer of milk which stood on the top of it.\n“No; we don’t keep a cat. But there is a cheetah and a baboon.”\n“Ah, yes, of course! Well, a cheetah is just a big cat, and yet a saucer of milk does not go very far in satisfying its wants, I daresay. There is one point which I should wish to determine.” He squatted down in front of the wooden chair and examined the seat of it with the greatest attention.\n“Thank you. That is quite settled,” said he, rising and putting his lens in his pocket. “Hullo! Here is something interesting!”\nThe object which had caught his eye was a small dog lash hung on one corner of the bed. The lash, however, was curled upon itself and tied so as to make a loop of whipcord.\n“What do you make of that, Watson?”\n“It’s a common enough lash. But I don’t know why it should be tied.”\n“That is not quite so common, is it? Ah, me! it’s a wicked world, and when a clever man turns his brains to crime it is the worst of all. I think that I have seen enough now, Miss Stoner, and with your permission we shall walk out upon the lawn.”",

Here is a revised simulated output for `generate_literary_segment`, closely following the structure, sequence, and descriptive detail of the original \"Speckled Band\" passage, and avoiding invented content or emotional interpretation:\n\n---\n\n**Simulated Output:**\n\nThe building was of grey, lichen-blotched stone, with a high central portion and two curving wings, like the claws of a crab, thrown out on each side. To left and right, the long corridors showed signs of neglect: the windows were broken in places, and the stonework was crumbling. At the far end of the left wing, a line of scaffolding was erected against the wall, but there was no sign of workmen or any recent repairs.\n\nHolmes stood for a moment, surveying the façade. “You occupy the middle window, Miss Stoner?” he asked.\n\n“Yes, that is my room now,” she replied, indicating the second window from the left.\n\n“And the one at the far end?”\n\n“That was my sister’s—now mine. The other is Dr. Roylott’s.”\n\nHolmes walked up to the three windows in turn, examining each with care. He noted the iron bars set into the stone, and the aged, weather-stained sills. He then requested, “Would you be so good as to go inside, Miss Stoner, and fasten the shutters of your window?”\n\nHelen disappeared within, and a moment later we heard the bolts slide into place. Holmes tried the shutters from the outside, but they were firmly secured. He repeated the process at the other two windows, with the same result.\n\n“There is no way of entering by these windows,” he remarked. “Let us proceed.”\n\nWe entered the house by a side door, and Holmes declined to examine the third chamber, saying, “We will confine our attention to the second room, if you please.” We passed along a narrow corridor, the floor covered with a faded, threadbare carpet, and the walls lined with worm-eaten oak panelling.\n\nThe bedroom was small and plainly furnished. There was a low, narrow bed, a chest of drawers, a dressing-table, and two chairs. The carpet was a square of old Wilton, much worn in the centre. Holmes’s eyes roved over every detail. He took out his lens and knelt to examine the floorboards and the skirting, peering into the cracks and corners. He scrutinized the panelling, running his fingers along the joints.\n\nPresently, his attention was drawn to a thick bell-rope which hung down beside the bed. He gave it a sharp tug, but it neither rang nor moved freely.\n\n“When was this bell-rope put in?” he asked.\n\n“It was about two years ago,” replied Miss Stoner. “It was put there at my stepfather’s request, but neither my sister nor I have ever used it.”\n\nHolmes examined the rope closely, then followed it up to where it was fastened to a hook just above a small ventilator in the wall.\n\n“A dummy, as I suspected,” he said. “And this ventilator—does it open to the outside?”\n\n“No, it opens into Dr. Roylott’s room.”\n\nHolmes measured the ventilator with his stick. “It is a small opening, and quite modern in appearance. You say it was made at the same time as the bell-rope?”\n\n“Yes, sir.”\n\nHolmes nodded, and we passed into the adjoining room. Dr. Roylott’s chamber was larger, but sparsely furnished: a camp-bed, a large iron safe, a wooden chair, a plain table, and a shelf of technical books. Holmes examined the safe, upon which stood a white saucer of milk.\n\n“You keep a cat?” he inquired.\n\n“No; only the cheetah and the baboon.”\n\nHolmes looked at the chair, then at a small dog lash, curled into a loop, which hung from the bedpost. He picked it up and examined it minutely.\n\n“A dog lash with a peculiar knot,” he observed, replacing it.\n\nHe glanced once more around the room, his face grave and thoughtful.

MAJOR STRUCTURAL ISSUES:\n- The completion omits the detailed description of the state of disrepair in the left and central wings, as well as the specific mention of scaffolding and the absence of workmen, which are present early in the original passage.\n- The sequence involving Holmes's methodical examination of the exterior windows, including his request for Miss Stoner to bar the shutters and his attempts to force them open, is condensed and lacks the step-by-step investigative actions described in the original.\n- The transition into the house and the explicit refusal to examine the third chamber are missing, as is the clear progression from the corridor to the second bedroom.\n\n2. MISSING ELEMENTS:\n- The completion does not include the detailed inventory of the bedroom's furnishings and the description of the room's age and condition, such as the worm-eaten oak panelling and the Wilton carpet.\n- The process of Holmes examining the floor and panelling with his lens, crawling and inspecting cracks, is only briefly referenced and lacks the original's thoroughness.\n- The dialogue about the bell-rope, including the questioning about its installation and use, is abbreviated, omitting the back-and-forth that clarifies its purpose and history.\n- The discussion about the ventilator, its placement, and its modernity is summarized rather than explored through dialogue.\n- The inventory and description of Dr. Roylott’s room, including the technical books, armchair, and the specific arrangement of furniture, are not fully detailed.\n- The examination of the safe, the questioning about its contents, and the exchange about the possibility of a cat inside are condensed or missing.\n- The detailed inspection of the dog lash, including its unusual loop, is not fully described.\n\n3. INACCURATE ELEMENTS:\n- The order of events is altered: the completion sometimes merges or reorders investigative steps, such as moving from the exterior to the interior without the original’s clear sequence.\n- Some dialogue is paraphrased or generalized, losing the specificity and progression of the original exchanges, particularly regarding the bell-rope and ventilator.\n- The completion introduces invented atmospheric details (e.g., the scent of damp earth and rotting leaves) and internal reflections that are not present in the original passage.\n- The ending adds a sense of emotional weight and deduction that is more interpretive than the original, which maintains a more observational tone.\n\nTo improve, ensure all investigative steps, room descriptions, and dialogue exchanges are included in the correct order, avoid inventing new atmospheric or emotional content, and maintain the original’s focus on methodical observation and inquiry."

            "prefix-probing": "Its windows were broken and blocked with wooden boards, and the roof sagged in places, giving the whole structure a forlorn and desolate air. The grounds about it were overgrown with nettles and brambles, and the gravel drive was little more than a track, half lost in the encroaching grass. As we approached, a chill wind seemed to sweep from the house itself, as if the very stones exhaled a sense of decay and neglect.\n\nHolmes paused at the gate, his keen eyes taking in every detail. \"Observe, Watson,\" he said quietly, \"the marks of recent wheels upon the drive. Despite the general air of abandonment, someone has been here not long ago.\"\n\nI looked where he pointed and saw, indeed, the faint impression of carriage wheels in the soft earth, as well as the prints of horses' hooves. Holmes knelt to examine them more closely, his long fingers brushing aside the grass.\n\n\"Two horses, light carriage,\" he murmured. \"The wheels are narrow, and the depth of the impression suggests a considerable weight. The carriage was here within the last day, perhaps even this morning.\"\n\nWe passed through the gate and made our way up the drive, the silence broken only by the crunch of our footsteps and the distant cawing of rooks. As we drew nearer, I saw that the great front door stood slightly ajar, its paint peeling and the ironwork rusted.\n\nHolmes pushed it open, and we stepped into a wide, shadowy hall. The air was thick with dust, and our footsteps echoed on the flagstones. Faded portraits stared down from the walls, their features obscured by grime. A grand staircase rose before us, its banister festooned with cobwebs.\n\n\"Let us proceed with caution, Watson,\" Holmes whispered. \"We do not know who or what we may find within.\"\n\nWe moved quietly through the hall, our eyes alert for any sign of movement. To our right, a door stood open, revealing a drawing-room in even greater disarray. Furniture was overturned, and the remains of a fire smoldered in the grate. Holmes crossed to the hearth and knelt, sifting through the ashes.\n\n\"Someone has been here recently,\" he said. \"See how the embers still glow. And here—\" he picked up a scrap of paper, half-burned, and examined it closely. \"A letter, Watson. The writing is almost illegible, but I can make out the words 'danger' and 'midnight.'\"\n\nI felt a shiver run down my spine. \"What do you suppose it means, Holmes?\"\n\nHe did not answer at once, but continued to search the room, his eyes missing nothing. At last, he straightened and turned to me.\n\n\"It means, my dear Watson, that we are not alone in this house. Someone has been here, perhaps is here still. We must be on our guard.\"\n\nWe left the drawing-room and ascended the staircase, our footsteps muffled by the thick dust. On the landing, a door stood half-open, and Holmes motioned for me to follow. Inside, the room was bare save for a single chair and a battered writing-desk. Papers were scattered across the floor, and a broken lamp lay in one corner.\n\nHolmes crossed to the desk and began to examine its contents. \"Here is something of interest,\" he said, holding up a small notebook. He flipped through its pages, his brow furrowed in concentration.\n\n\"It is a diary, Watson. The entries are brief, but they speak of fear and suspicion. Listen: 'I hear them at night, moving in the corridors. I dare not sleep. The message came again—midnight, by the old well.'\"\n\nI glanced at Holmes, my unease growing. \"What do you make of it?\"\n\n\"It is clear that our quarry is involved in something secret and dangerous. The mention of the old well is significant. We must find it.\"\n\nWe left the room and continued our search, moving from chamber to chamber. Each was more dilapidated than the last, the signs of neglect and decay everywhere. At last, we came to a door at the end of a long corridor. It was locked, but Holmes produced a set of picks from his pocket and soon had it open.\n\nBeyond was a narrow staircase, winding down into darkness. Holmes lit his lantern, and we descended, the air growing colder and damper with each step. At the bottom, we found ourselves in a vaulted cellar, the walls slick with moisture.\n\nIn one corner stood an ancient well, its stones green with moss. Holmes approached it cautiously, his lantern held high. The well was covered by a heavy wooden lid, which he lifted with some effort.\n\nInside, we saw a coil of rope and, to our astonishment, a small leather pouch. Holmes reached in and drew it out, opening it to reveal a collection of jewels—diamonds, rubies, and emeralds, their facets gleaming in the lantern light.\n\n\"The missing treasure!\" I exclaimed.\n\nHolmes nodded. \"Yes, Watson. The solution to our mystery lies here. But we must be careful. Whoever hid these jewels may return at any moment.\"\n\nEven as he spoke, we heard footsteps above, echoing through the cellar. Holmes extinguished the lantern, and we crouched in the shadows, scarcely daring to breathe.\n\nThe footsteps drew nearer, and a figure appeared at the top of the stairs, silhouetted against the faint light. Holmes tensed, ready to spring. The figure descended, pausing at the foot of the stairs.\n\n\"Who's there?\" a voice called, trembling with fear.\n\nHolmes stepped forward, his voice calm and commanding. \"It is Sherlock Holmes. You have nothing to fear if you tell the truth.\"\n\nThe figure sagged with relief and stepped into the light. It was a young woman, her face pale and drawn.\n\n\"Thank God you are here, Mr. Holmes,\" she whispered. \"I did not know where else to turn.\"\n\nHolmes led her to a chair and offered her water from a flask. \"Tell us everything, Miss. We are here to help.\"\n\nShe gathered her courage and began her tale. \"My name is Alice Fenwick. My father was the caretaker of this house. He discovered the jewels hidden in the well, but before he could tell anyone, he was threatened by a band of thieves. They forced him to keep their secret, and he lived in terror until his death. I found his diary and the message about midnight by the old well. I came here tonight, hoping to recover the jewels and bring them to the authorities.\"\n\nHolmes listened intently. \"And the thieves?\"\n\n\"They are coming tonight. I overheard their plan. They mean to take the jewels and leave the country.\"\n\nHolmes turned to me. \"We must act quickly, Watson. We will set a trap for these villains.\"\n\nWe concealed ourselves in the shadows, the jewels hidden once more in the well. The minutes dragged by, each one an eternity. At last, we heard the sound of voices and the creak of the cellar door. Three men entered, their faces masked, their eyes gleaming with greed.\n\nHolmes waited until they were gathered around the well, then sprang forward, his revolver drawn. \"You are surrounded. Surrender, or face the consequences.\"\n\nThe men hesitated, then lunged at us. A brief struggle ensued, but Holmes and I, aided by Miss Fenwick's courage, soon had them subdued. We bound them and sent for the police, who arrived in due course and took the villains into custody.\n\nAs dawn broke over the old house, Holmes turned to me with a smile. \"Another case concluded, Watson. The jewels will be returned to their rightful owner, and Miss Fenwick is safe at last.\"\n\nI nodded, filled with admiration for my friend's skill and bravery. As we left the house, the first rays of sunlight pierced the clouds, and the old building seemed, for a moment, to stand a little straighter, as if the weight of its secrets had at last been lifted."

          "text_segment": "I had never seen my friend’s face so grim or his brow so dark as it was when we turned from the scene of this investigation. We had walked several times up and down the lawn, neither Miss Stoner nor myself liking to break in upon his thoughts before he roused himself from his reverie.\n“It is very essential, Miss Stoner,” said he, “that you should absolutely follow my advice in every respect.”\n“I shall most certainly do so.”\n“The matter is too serious for any hesitation. Your life may depend upon your compliance.”\n“I assure you that I am in your hands.”\n“In the first place, both my friend and I must spend the night in your room.”\nBoth Miss Stoner and I gazed at him in astonishment.\n“Yes, it must be so. Let me explain. I believe that that is the village inn over there?”\n“Yes, that is the Crown.”\n“Very good. Your windows would be visible from there?”\n“Certainly.”\n“You must confine yourself to your room, on pretence of a headache, when your stepfather comes back. Then when you hear him retire for the night, you must open the shutters of your window, undo the hasp, put your lamp there as a signal to us, and then withdraw quietly with everything which you are likely to want into the room which you used to occupy. I have no doubt that, in spite of the repairs, you could manage there for one night.”\n“Oh, yes, easily.”\n“The rest you will leave in our hands.”\n“But what will you do?”\n“We shall spend the night in your room, and we shall investigate the cause of this noise which has disturbed you.”\n“I believe, Mr. Holmes, that you have already made up your mind,” said Miss Stoner, laying her hand upon my companion’s sleeve.\n“Perhaps I have.”\n“Then, for pity’s sake, tell me what was the cause of my sister’s death.”\n“I should prefer to have clearer proofs before I speak.”\n“You can at least tell me whether my own thought is correct, and if she died from some sudden fright.”\n“No, I do not think so. I think that there was probably some more tangible cause. And now, Miss Stoner, we must leave you for if Dr. Roylott returned and saw us our journey would be in vain. Good-bye, and be brave, for if you will do what I have told you, you may rest assured that we shall soon drive away the dangers that threaten you.”\nSherlock Holmes and I had no difficulty in engaging a bedroom and sitting-room at the Crown Inn. They were on the upper floor, and from our window we could command a view of the avenue gate, and of the inhabited wing of Stoke Moran Manor House. At dusk we saw Dr. Grimesby Roylott drive past, his huge form looming up beside the little figure of the lad who drove him. The boy had some slight difficulty in undoing the heavy iron gates, and we heard the hoarse roar of the Doctor’s voice and saw the fury with which he shook his clinched fists at him. The trap drove on, and a few minutes later we saw a sudden light spring up among the trees as the lamp was lit in one of the sitting-rooms.\n“Do you know, Watson,” said Holmes as we sat together in the gathering darkness, “I have really some scruples as to taking you to-night. There is a distinct element of danger.”\n“Can I be of assistance?”\n“Your presence might be invaluable.”\n“Then I shall certainly come.”\n“It is very kind of you.”\n“You speak of danger. You have evidently seen more in these rooms than was visible to me.”\n“No, but I fancy that I may have deduced a little more. I imagine that you saw all that I did.”\n“I saw nothing remarkable save the bell-rope, and what purpose that could answer I confess is more than I can imagine.”\n“You saw the ventilator, too?”\n“Yes, but I do not think that it is such a very unusual thing to have a small opening between two rooms. It was so small that a rat could hardly pass through.”\n“I knew that we should find a ventilator before ever we came to Stoke Moran.”\n“My dear Holmes!”\n“Oh, yes, I did. You remember in her statement she said that her sister could smell Dr. Roylott’s cigar. Now, of course that suggested at once that there must be a communication between the two rooms. It could only be a small one, or it would have been remarked upon at the coroner’s inquiry. I deduced a ventilator.”\n“But what harm can there be in that?”\n“Well, there is at least a curious coincidence of dates. A ventilator is made, a cord is hung, and a lady who sleeps in the bed dies. Does not that strike you?”\n“I cannot as yet see any connection.”\n“Did you observe anything very peculiar about that bed?”\n“No.”\n“It was clamped to the floor. Did you ever see a bed fastened like that before?”\n“I cannot say that I have.”\n“The lady could not move her bed. It must always be in the same relative position to the ventilator and to the rope—or so we may call it, since it was clearly never meant for a bell-pull.”\n“Holmes,” I cried, “I seem to see dimly what you are hinting at. We are only just in time to prevent some subtle and horrible crime.”\n“Subtle enough and horrible enough. When a doctor does go wrong he is the first of criminals. He has nerve and he has knowledge. Palmer and Pritchard were among the heads of their profession. This man strikes even deeper, but I think, Watson, that we shall be able to strike deeper still. But we shall have horrors enough before the night is over; for goodness’ sake let us have a quiet pipe and turn our minds for a few hours to something more cheerful.”",

            "prefix-probing": "For several minutes we walked in silence, each occupied with his own thoughts. Holmes strode along with his head sunk upon his chest and his brows drawn together in a frown of deep concentration. I could see that the singular features of the case had taken a strong hold upon his imagination, and that he was revolving them in his mind with all the intensity of his keen and active intellect.\n\nPresently he broke the silence. \"You have seen the paper, Watson?\" he asked, glancing at me sideways.\n\n\"Yes, I have seen it,\" I replied. \"It is certainly a most remarkable document.\"\n\n\"It is more than remarkable, Watson. It is unique. I confess that I have never before met with such a combination of the mysterious and the suggestive. The handwriting, the curious phraseology, the very paper itself—all point to a mind of no common order.\"\n\n\"And yet,\" I ventured, \"the facts themselves seem to be simple enough.\"\n\n\"Simple!\" Holmes exclaimed, halting in his stride and turning to face me. \"My dear Watson, nothing is more deceptive than the obvious fact. I grant you that the case presents some features of simplicity, but it is precisely those features which make it so perplexing.\"\n\nHe resumed his walk, and I fell into step beside him, pondering his words. We had reached the corner of the street when Holmes suddenly stopped and laid his hand upon my arm.\n\n\"Let us review the situation,\" he said. \"We have a client who is evidently in great distress, a mysterious letter, and a series of events which, taken separately, might appear trivial, but which, when considered together, form a pattern of the most singular character.\"\n\n\"You think, then, that there is more in this case than meets the eye?\" I asked.\n\n\"I am convinced of it,\" Holmes replied. \"There are certain points which, if we can elucidate them, will, I am sure, throw a flood of light upon the whole matter.\"\n\nHe paused for a moment, lost in thought, and then continued, \"Let us return to Baker Street, Watson. I have some experiments to make which may help us to unravel this tangled skein.\"\n\nWe hailed a cab and were soon rattling through the busy streets of London. Holmes sat in silence, his long, thin fingers drumming upon the window ledge, his eyes fixed upon some distant point, as though he were following the thread of his reasoning to its logical conclusion.\n\nWhen we arrived at our lodgings, Holmes threw himself into his armchair and motioned me to take a seat opposite him.\n\n\"Now, Watson,\" he said, \"let us go over the facts once more.\"\n\nI took out my notebook and read aloud the details of the case as I had recorded them. Holmes listened attentively, occasionally interjecting a question or a comment, but for the most part remaining silent, his keen eyes fixed upon me as though he were weighing every word.\n\nWhen I had finished, he leaned back in his chair and closed his eyes.\n\n\"There are one or two points which I should like to clear up,\" he said at last. \"In the first place, the handwriting of the letter. You observed, of course, that it was disguised?\"\n\n\"Yes,\" I replied. \"It was evidently written by someone who wished to conceal his identity.\"\n\n\"Precisely. And yet there are certain characteristics which betray the writer. The slant of the letters, the pressure of the pen, the formation of certain words—all these are clues which, if properly interpreted, may lead us to the author.\"\n\nHe rose from his chair and began to pace the room, his hands clasped behind his back.\n\n\"Then there is the matter of the paper,\" he continued. \"It is of a peculiar quality, not commonly found in this country. I have sent a sample to my friend at the British Museum, who is an expert in such matters. We should have his report by tomorrow.\"\n\nHe paused and looked at me with a smile. \"You see, Watson, how even the smallest detail may be of the utmost importance.\"\n\n\"Indeed,\" I replied. \"I am continually amazed by the way in which you are able to draw such far-reaching conclusions from the most trivial facts.\"\n\nHolmes laughed softly. \"It is, perhaps, a gift,\" he said. \"But it is one which can be cultivated by anyone who is willing to observe and to reason.\"\n\nHe resumed his seat and took up his violin, drawing the bow across the strings in a long, melancholy note.\n\n\"We can do nothing more tonight,\" he said. \"Let us wait for the report from the British Museum. In the meantime, I suggest that we both get some rest.\"\n\nI nodded in agreement and retired to my room, my mind still occupied with the strange events of the day. As I lay in bed, I could hear the soft strains of Holmes's violin drifting through the door, a fitting accompaniment to the mystery which we had undertaken to solve.\n\nThe following morning, I found Holmes already at work, his desk littered with papers and chemical apparatus. He greeted me with a nod and handed me a slip of paper.\n\n\"The report from the British Museum,\" he said. \"As I suspected, the paper is of Bohemian manufacture, rarely seen in England. That, at least, gives us a starting point.\"\n\nHe rose and began to pace the room once more, his mind evidently busy with fresh possibilities.\n\n\"We must follow up this clue at once, Watson,\" he said. \"There is not a moment to be lost.\"\n\nAnd with that, we set out once more into the bustling streets of London, determined to unravel the mystery which had so deeply engaged the attention of my remarkable friend."

          "text_segment": "About nine o’clock the light among the trees was extinguished, and all was dark in the direction of the Manor House. Two hours passed slowly away, and then, suddenly, just at the stroke of eleven, a single bright light shone out right in front of us.\n“That is our signal,” said Holmes, springing to his feet; “it comes from the middle window.”\nAs we passed out he exchanged a few words with the landlord, explaining that we were going on a late visit to an acquaintance, and that it was possible that we might spend the night there. A moment later we were out on the dark road, a chill wind blowing in our faces, and one yellow light twinkling in front of us through the gloom to guide us on our sombre errand.\nThere was little difficulty in entering the grounds, for unrepaired breaches gaped in the old park wall. Making our way among the trees, we reached the lawn, crossed it, and were about to enter through the window when out from a clump of laurel bushes there darted what seemed to be a hideous and distorted child, who threw itself upon the grass with writhing limbs and then ran swiftly across the lawn into the darkness.\n“My God!” I whispered; “did you see it?”\nHolmes was for the moment as startled as I. His hand closed like a vice upon my wrist in his agitation. Then he broke into a low laugh and put his lips to my ear.\n“It is a nice household,” he murmured. “That is the baboon.”\nI had forgotten the strange pets which the Doctor affected. There was a cheetah, too; perhaps we might find it upon our shoulders at any moment. I confess that I felt easier in my mind when, after following Holmes’ example and slipping off my shoes, I found myself inside the bedroom. My companion noiselessly closed the shutters, moved the lamp onto the table, and cast his eyes round the room. All was as we had seen it in the daytime. Then creeping up to me and making a trumpet of his hand, he whispered into my ear again so gently that it was all that I could do to distinguish the words:\n“The least sound would be fatal to our plans.”\nI nodded to show that I had heard.\n“We must sit without light. He would see it through the ventilator.”\nI nodded again.\n“Do not go asleep; your very life may depend upon it. Have your pistol ready in case we should need it. I will sit on the side of the bed, and you in that chair.”\nI took out my revolver and laid it on the corner of the table.\nHolmes had brought up a long thin cane, and this he placed upon the bed beside him. By it he laid the box of matches and the stump of a candle. Then he turned down the lamp, and we were left in darkness.\nHow shall I ever forget that dreadful vigil? I could not hear a sound, not even the drawing of a breath, and yet I knew that my companion sat open-eyed, within a few feet of me, in the same state of nervous tension in which I was myself. The shutters cut off the least ray of light, and we waited in absolute darkness.\nFrom outside came the occasional cry of a night-bird, and once at our very window a long drawn catlike whine, which told us that the cheetah was indeed at liberty. Far away we could hear the deep tones of the parish clock, which boomed out every quarter of an hour. How long they seemed, those quarters! Twelve struck, and one and two and three, and still we sat waiting silently for whatever might befall.\nSuddenly there was the momentary gleam of a light up in the direction of the ventilator, which vanished immediately, but was succeeded by a strong smell of burning oil and heated metal. Someone in the next room had lit a dark-lantern. I heard a gentle sound of movement, and then all was silent once more, though the smell grew stronger. For half an hour I sat with straining ears. Then suddenly another sound became audible—a very gentle, soothing sound, like that of a small jet of steam escaping continually from a kettle. The instant that we heard it, Holmes sprang from the bed, struck a match, and lashed furiously with his cane at the bell-pull.\n“You see it, Watson?” he yelled. “You see it?”\nBut I saw nothing. At the moment when Holmes struck the light I heard a low, clear whistle, but the sudden glare flashing into my weary eyes made it impossible for me to tell what it was at which my friend lashed so savagely. I could, however, see that his face was deadly pale and filled with horror and loathing. He had ceased to strike and was gazing up at the ventilator when suddenly there broke from the silence of the night the most horrible cry to which I have ever listened. It swelled up louder and louder, a hoarse yell of pain and fear and anger all mingled in the one dreadful shriek. They say that away down in the village, and even in the distant parsonage, that cry raised the sleepers from their beds. It struck cold to our hearts, and I stood gazing at Holmes, and he at me, until the last echoes of it had died away into the silence from which it rose.\n“What can it mean?” I gasped.\n“It means that it is all over,” Holmes answered. “And perhaps, after all, it is for the best. Take your pistol, and we will enter Dr. Roylott’s room.”\nWith a grave face he lit the lamp and led the way down the corridor. Twice he struck at the chamber door without any reply from within. Then he turned the handle and entered, I at his heels, with the cocked pistol in my hand.\nIt was a singular sight which met our eyes. On the table stood a dark-lantern with the shutter half open, throwing a brilliant beam of light upon the iron safe, the door of which was ajar. Beside this table, on the wooden chair, sat Dr. Grimesby Roylott clad in a long grey dressing-gown, his bare ankles protruding beneath, and his feet thrust into red heelless Turkish slippers. Across his lap lay the short stock with the long lash which we had noticed during the day. His chin was cocked upward and his eyes were fixed in a dreadful, rigid stare at the corner of the ceiling. Round his brow he had a peculiar yellow band, with brownish speckles, which seemed to be bound tightly round his head. As we entered he made neither sound nor motion.\n“The band! the speckled band!” whispered Holmes.\nI took a step forward. In an instant his strange headgear began to move, and there reared itself from among his hair the squat diamond-shaped head and puffed neck of a loathsome serpent.\n“It is a swamp adder!” cried Holmes; “the deadliest snake in India. He has died within ten seconds of being bitten. Violence does, in truth, recoil upon the violent, and the schemer falls into the pit which he digs for another. Let us thrust this creature back into its den, and we can then remove Miss Stoner to some place of shelter and let the county police know what has happened.”\nAs he spoke he drew the dog-whip swiftly from the dead man’s lap, and throwing the noose round the reptile’s neck he drew it from its horrid perch and, carrying it at arm’s length, threw it into the iron safe, which he closed upon it.\nSuch are the true facts of the death of Dr. Grimesby Roylott, of Stoke Moran. It is not necessary that I should prolong a narrative which has already run to too great a length by telling how we broke the sad news to the terrified girl, how we conveyed her by the morning train to the care of her good aunt at Harrow, of how the slow process of official inquiry came to the conclusion that the doctor met his fate while indiscreetly playing with a dangerous pet. The little which I had yet to learn of the case was told me by Sherlock Holmes as we travelled back next day.\n“I had,” said he, “come to an entirely erroneous conclusion which shows, my dear Watson, how dangerous it always is to reason from insufficient data. The presence of the gipsies, and the use of the word ‘band,’ which was used by the poor girl, no doubt, to explain the appearance which she had caught a hurried glimpse of by the light of her match, were sufficient to put me upon an entirely wrong scent. I can only claim the merit that I instantly reconsidered my position when, however, it became clear to me that whatever danger threatened an occupant of the room could not come either from the window or the door. My attention was speedily drawn, as I have already remarked to you, to this ventilator, and to the bell-rope which hung down to the bed. The discovery that this was a dummy, and that the bed was clamped to the floor, instantly gave rise to the suspicion that the rope was there as a bridge for something passing through the hole and coming to the bed. The idea of a snake instantly occurred to me, and when I coupled it with my knowledge that the doctor was furnished with a supply of creatures from India, I felt that I was probably on the right track. The idea of using a form of poison which could not possibly be discovered by any chemical test was just such a one as would occur to a clever and ruthless man who had had an Eastern training. The rapidity with which such a poison would take effect would also, from his point of view, be an advantage. It would be a sharp-eyed coroner, indeed, who could distinguish the two little dark punctures which would show where the poison fangs had done their work. Then I thought of the whistle. Of course he must recall the snake before the morning light revealed it to the victim. He had trained it, probably by the use of the milk which we saw, to return to him when summoned. He would put it through this ventilator at the hour that he thought best, with the certainty that it would crawl down the rope and land on the bed. It might or might not bite the occupant, perhaps she might escape every night for a week, but sooner or later she must fall a victim.\n“I had come to these conclusions before ever I had entered his room. An inspection of his chair showed me that he had been in the habit of standing on it, which of course would be necessary in order that he should reach the ventilator. The sight of the safe, the saucer of milk, and the loop of whipcord were enough to finally dispel any doubts which may have remained. The metallic clang heard by Miss Stoner was obviously caused by her stepfather hastily closing the door of his safe upon its terrible occupant. Having once made up my mind, you know the steps which I took in order to put the matter to the proof. I heard the creature hiss as I have no doubt that you did also, and I instantly lit the light and attacked it.”\n“With the result of driving it through the ventilator.”\n“And also with the result of causing it to turn upon its master at the other side. Some of the blows of my cane came home and roused its snakish temper, so that it flew upon the first person it saw. In this way I am no doubt indirectly responsible for Dr. Grimesby Roylott’s death, and I cannot say that it is likely to weigh very heavily upon my conscience.”",

Two hours passed slowly away, and then, suddenly, just at the stroke of eleven, a single bright light shone out right in front of us.\n\n\"That is our signal,\" said Holmes, springing to his feet; \"it comes from the middle window.\"\n\nAs we passed out, he exchanged a few words with the landlord, explaining that we were going on a late visit to an acquaintance, and that it was possible that we might spend the night there. A moment later we were out on the dark road, a chill wind blowing in our faces, and one yellow light twinkling in front of us through the gloom to guide us on our somber errand.\n\nThere was little difficulty in entering the grounds, for unrepaired breaches gaped in the old park wall. Making our way among the trees, we reached the lawn, crossed it, and were about to enter through the window, when out from a clump of laurel bushes there darted what seemed to be a hideous and distorted child, who threw itself upon the grass with writhing limbs and then ran swiftly across the lawn into the darkness.\n\n\"My God!\" I whispered; \"did you see it?\"\n\nHolmes was for the moment as startled as I. His hand closed like a vice upon my wrist in his agitation. Then he broke into a low laugh and put his lips to my ear.\n\n\"It is a nice household,\" he murmured. \"That is the baboon.\"\n\nI had forgotten the strange pets which the doctor affected. There was a cheetah, too; perhaps we might find it upon our shoulders at any moment. I confess that I felt easier in my mind when, after following Holmes’s example and slipping off my shoes, I found myself inside the bedroom. My companion noiselessly closed the shutters, moved the lamp onto the table, and cast his eyes round the room. All was as we had seen it in the daytime. Then, creeping up to me and making a trumpet of his hand, he whispered into my ear again so gently that it was all that I could do to distinguish the words:\n\n\"The least sound would be fatal to our plans.\"\n\nI nodded to show that I had heard.\n\n\"We must sit without light. He would see it through the ventilator.\"\n\nI nodded again.\n\n\"Do not go to sleep; your very life may depend upon it. Have your pistol ready in case we should need it. I will sit on the side of the bed, and you in that chair.\"\n\nI took out my revolver and laid it on the corner of the table.\n\nHolmes had brought up a long thin cane, and this he placed upon the bed beside him. By it he laid the box of matches and the stump of a candle. Then he turned down the lamp, and we were left in darkness.\n\nHow shall I ever forget that dreadful vigil? I could not hear a sound, not even the drawing of a breath, and yet I knew that my companion sat open-eyed, within a few feet of me, in the same state of nervous tension in which I was myself. The shutters cut off the least ray of light, and we waited in absolute darkness.\n\nFrom outside came the occasional cry of a night-bird. Once at our very window a long drawn catlike whine, as of a cheetah, came from the shrubbery, causing me to grip my revolver convulsively. Far away we could hear the deep tones of the parish clock, which boomed out every quarter of an hour. How long they seemed, those quarters! Twelve struck, and one and two and three, and still we sat waiting silently for whatever might befall.\n\nSuddenly there was the momentary gleam of a light up in the direction of the ventilator, which vanished immediately, but was succeeded by a strong smell of burning oil and heated metal. Someone in the next room had lit a dark-lantern. I heard a gentle sound of movement, and then all was silent once more, though the smell grew stronger. For half an hour I sat with straining ears. Then suddenly another sound became audible—a very gentle, soothing sound, like that of a small jet of steam escaping continually from a kettle. The instant that we heard it, Holmes sprang from the bed, struck a match, and lashed furiously with his cane at the bell-pull.\n\n\"You see it, Watson?\" he yelled. \"You see it?\"\n\nBut I saw nothing. At the moment when Holmes struck the light I heard a low, clear whistle, but the sudden glare flashing into my weary eyes made it impossible for me to tell what it was at which my friend lashed so savagely. I could, however, see that his face was deadly pale and filled with horror and loathing. He had ceased to strike and was gazing up at the ventilator, when suddenly there broke from the silence of the night the most horrible cry to which I have ever listened. It swelled up louder and louder, a hoarse yell of pain and fear and anger all mingled in the one dreadful shriek. They say that away down in the village, and even in the distant parsonage, that cry raised the sleepers from their beds. It struck cold to our hearts, and I stood gazing at Holmes, and he at me, until the last echoes of it had died away into the silence from which it rose.\n\n\"What can it mean?\" I gasped.\n\n\"It means that it is all over,\" Holmes answered. \"And perhaps, after all, it is for the best. Take your pistol, and we will enter Dr. Roylott’s room.\"\n\nWith a grave face he lit the lamp and led the way down the corridor. Twice he struck at the chamber door without any reply from within. Then he turned the handle and entered, I at his heels, with the cocked pistol in my hand.\n\nIt was a singular sight which met our eyes. On the table stood a dark-lantern with the shutter half open, throwing a brilliant beam of light upon the iron safe, the door of which was ajar. Beside this table, on the wooden chair, sat Dr. Grimesby Roylott, clad in a long gray dressing-gown, his bare ankles protruding beneath, and his feet thrust into red heelless Turkish slippers. Across his lap lay the short stock with the long lash which we had noticed during the day. His chin was cocked upward and his eyes were fixed in a dreadful, rigid stare at the corner of the ceiling. Round his brow he had a peculiar yellow band, with brownish speckles, which seemed to be bound tightly round his head.\n\nAs we entered he made neither sound nor motion.\n\n\"The band! the speckled band!\" whispered Holmes.\n\nI took a step forward. In an instant his strange headgear began to move, and there reared itself from among his hair the squat, diamond-shaped head and puffed neck of a loathsome serpent.\n\n\"It is a swamp adder!\" cried Holmes; \"the deadliest snake in India.

            "prefix-probing": "We waited in a suspense which made the seconds seem like hours. The chill of the night air crept into our bones, and the silence was broken only by the occasional hoot of an owl or the distant barking of a dog. Holmes lay motionless, his eyes fixed upon the faint outline of the house, while I found myself straining my ears for the slightest sound that might betray the approach of our quarry.\n\nTime passed slowly. Once or twice I fancied that I heard stealthy footsteps among the leaves, but each time it proved to be nothing more than the wind stirring the branches overhead. At last, just as I was beginning to think that our vigil would prove fruitless, Holmes gripped my arm with sudden intensity.\n\n\"Look!\" he whispered. \"There! By the side gate.\"\n\nI followed the direction of his gaze and saw a dim figure moving cautiously along the shadowy path that led to the rear of the house. The figure paused, glanced around as if to make sure that he was unobserved, and then slipped through the gate, closing it softly behind him.\n\nHolmes rose noiselessly to his feet, and I did the same. Together, we crept forward, keeping to the cover of the trees until we were within a few yards of the gate. From our vantage point, we could see the figure moving stealthily towards a low window at the back of the house. He paused again, produced something from his pocket, and after a moment's fumbling, succeeded in opening the window. With a final glance over his shoulder, he slipped inside and disappeared from view.\n\nHolmes touched my arm and motioned for me to follow. We crossed the intervening space as silently as possible and crouched beneath the window. From within, we could hear the faint creak of floorboards and the soft rustle of clothing as the intruder moved about. Holmes peered cautiously over the sill, then drew back and whispered in my ear.\n\n\"It's as I suspected. He has gone straight to the study. Come, Watson, we must be quick.\"\n\nWe made our way to the door, which Holmes had earlier unlocked in anticipation of just such an event. He turned the handle slowly, and we slipped inside, moving as quietly as possible along the darkened corridor. The only light came from a faint glow beneath the door of the study, where the intruder was evidently at work.\n\nHolmes paused outside the door, listening intently. Then, with a swift motion, he flung the door open and stepped inside, I close behind him.\n\nThe scene that met our eyes was one of tense drama. The intruder, a man of medium height and build, was standing at the desk, a small lantern in one hand and a bundle of papers in the other. At the sudden intrusion, he started violently, dropping the papers and reaching for something in his coat pocket.\n\n\"No, you don't!\" cried Holmes, springing forward and seizing the man's wrist before he could draw a weapon. There was a brief struggle, but Holmes's grip was like iron, and in a moment he had disarmed the fellow and pinned him against the wall.\n\n\"Watson, if you would be so good as to retrieve those papers,\" Holmes said, not taking his eyes off the intruder.\n\nI stooped and gathered up the scattered documents, glancing at them as I did so. They appeared to be legal papers, deeds, and correspondence, all bearing the seal of the Manor House.\n\n\"So, Mr. Smithson,\" Holmes said, addressing the intruder by name, \"we meet at last. I must confess, your methods are ingenious, but not quite ingenious enough.\"\n\nThe man glared at Holmes, his face pale and drawn in the lantern light. \"You have no right—\" he began, but Holmes cut him off with a wave of his hand.\n\n\"On the contrary, I have every right. You have been systematically robbing your employer for months, and tonight you came to destroy the evidence of your guilt. Fortunately, Dr. Watson and I were here to prevent you.\"\n\nSmithson's shoulders slumped in defeat. \"It's over, then,\" he muttered.\n\n\"Yes, it is over,\" Holmes replied. \"Watson, if you would be so kind as to fetch the constable from the gate, I believe our work here is done.\"\n\nI hurried outside and soon returned with the constable, who took charge of the prisoner. Holmes and I watched as Smithson was led away, his head bowed in shame.\n\nAs we stood in the quiet study, Holmes turned to me with a smile. \"Another case concluded, Watson. I must say, your presence was invaluable tonight.\"\n\nI returned his smile, feeling a sense of satisfaction at having played a part in the capture of the criminal.\n\n\"Come, my friend,\" Holmes said, clapping me on the shoulder. \"Let us return to Baker Street. I believe we have earned a good night's rest.\"\n\nAnd so, as the first light of dawn crept over the horizon, we made our way back to London, the mystery of the Manor House at last laid to rest."

The latter, however, was a case which presented features of interest, though it was not marked by the same peculiarities as the adventure of the engineer’s thumb. It was, I believe, the first time that Holmes was ever called in to investigate a matter which had been brought to my own notice, and I must confess that I felt some pride in having been the means of introducing so remarkable a problem to his attention. As I have preserved notes of both these cases, and as they both occurred during the early days of our association, I shall now proceed to lay them before the public, beginning with the story of the engineer’s thumb."

I dressed hurriedly, for I knew by experience that railway cases were seldom trivial, and hastened downstairs. As I descended, my old ally, the guard, came out of the room and closed the door tightly behind him.\n“I’ve got him here,” he whispered, jerking his thumb over his shoulder; “he’s all right.”\n“What is it, then?” I asked, for his manner suggested that it was some strange creature which he had caged up in my room.\n“It’s a new patient,” he whispered. “I thought I’d bring him round myself; then he couldn’t slip away. There he is, all safe and sound. I must go now, Doctor; I have my dooties, just the same as you.” And off he went, this trusty tout, without even giving me time to thank him.\nI entered my consulting-room and found a gentleman seated by the table. He was quietly dressed in a suit of heather tweed with a soft cloth cap which he had laid down upon my books. Round one of his hands he had a handkerchief wrapped, which was mottled all over with bloodstains. He was young, not more than five-and-twenty, I should say, with a strong, masculine face; but he was exceedingly pale and gave me the impression of a man who was suffering from some strong agitation, which it took all his strength of mind to control.\n“I am sorry to knock you up so early, Doctor,” said he, “but I have had a very serious accident during the night. I came in by train this morning, and on inquiring at Paddington as to where I might find a doctor, a worthy fellow very kindly escorted me here. I gave the maid a card, but I see that she has left it upon the side-table.”\nI took it up and glanced at it. “Mr. Victor Hatherley, hydraulic engineer, 16A, Victoria Street (3rd floor).” That was the name, style, and abode of my morning visitor. “I regret that I have kept you waiting,” said I, sitting down in my library-chair. “You are fresh from a night journey, I understand, which is in itself a monotonous occupation.”\n“Oh, my night could not be called monotonous,” said he, and laughed. He laughed very heartily, with a high, ringing note, leaning back in his chair and shaking his sides. All my medical instincts rose up against that laugh.",

I came in by the night train from Reading, and the guard was kind enough to bring me here.

I have had a most extraordinary adventure.”\n\nHis manner was so strange that I began to have doubts as to his sanity, which, however, were soon dispelled by the intelligence and self-possession which he displayed as he proceeded with his story.",

My own practice was still in its infancy, and I found myself with ample leisure to observe my friend’s methods and to assist him when the opportunity arose.\n\nOne morning, as I sat at the breakfast table perusing the day’s news, Holmes entered with that brisk energy which always signalled the advent of a new case. He held in his hand a letter, the envelope of which bore the unmistakable mark of haste: the address was scrawled in a trembling hand, and the seal had been broken in the process of opening.\n\n“Watson,” said he, “we are to have a visitor. The matter is urgent, and I believe it will afford us both some intellectual exercise.”\n\nI set aside my paper. “Who is our client?”\n\nHe glanced at the letter. “A certain Mr. James Windibank, who requests our assistance in a matter of the utmost delicacy. He will be here within the hour.”\n\nHolmes seated himself at the table and poured himself a cup of coffee. “You will observe, Watson, that the handwriting is that of a man under considerable strain. The uneven pressure, the irregular slant—these are the hallmarks of anxiety. I suspect that our visitor is not only troubled, but also fearful.”\n\nI was about to reply when there came a sharp rap at the door. Mrs. Hudson ushered in a man of middle height, with a pale, nervous face and restless eyes. He glanced about the room as though seeking reassurance.\n\n“Mr. Windibank, I presume?” said Holmes, rising to greet him.\n\nThe man nodded, his hands twisting the brim of his hat. “Yes, sir. I—I hope you can help me. It is a most distressing affair.”\n\nHolmes gestured for him to sit. “Pray compose yourself, and tell us the facts as clearly as you can.”\n\nMr. Windibank took a deep breath. “It concerns my stepdaughter, Miss Mary Sutherland. She is a good girl, sir, and has a considerable sum of money left to her by her late father. For some time, she has been receiving the attentions of a gentleman who calls himself Hosmer Angel. He is a quiet, respectable man, but there is something about him I cannot quite place. He insists on secrecy, and will not allow her to see him except at certain times. Now, on the very morning of their intended wedding, he vanished without a trace.”\n\nHolmes steepled his fingers and regarded our visitor keenly. “And you wish me to discover what has become of Mr. Hosmer Angel?”\n\n“Indeed, sir. My stepdaughter is distraught, and I fear for her health. I have done all I can, but the police have been of little assistance.”\n\nHolmes nodded. “You have acted wisely in coming to me. I shall require a few particulars, and then I believe I may be able to shed some light on this curious affair.”\n\nThus began one of the more singular cases in Holmes’s career, and one which, though it may not have taxed his powers to their utmost, nevertheless provided a striking example of his method and insight."

It gave even my hardened nerves a shudder to look at it. There were four protruding fingers and a horrid red, spongy surface where the thumb should have been.

With a supreme effort, the man overcame his hysterical outburst, and his pallid cheeks flushed with shame as he passed his hand over his eyes.\n\n“I have been making a fool of myself,” he gasped. “Not at all,” I answered, with the utmost sympathy. “You have undergone a most severe shock. Let me give you a little brandy and water; it will revive you.”\n\nHe drank the mixture eagerly, and a little colour crept back into his face. “That’s better,” said I. “And now you must let me see your hand.”\n\nHe held it out to me, and I saw that it was wrapped in a blood-stained handkerchief. He began to unwind it, and presently laid bare a hand from which the thumb had been severed. The wound was a terrible one. It had been hacked or torn right out from the roots, and the hand was a horrible sight. It must have bled considerably.\n\n“I fainted when it was done,” he said in answer to my look of inquiry. “I think that I must have been senseless for a long time. When I came to, I found that it was still bleeding, so I tied one end of my handkerchief very tightly round the wrist and braced it up with a twig.”\n\n“Excellent!” I cried. “You should have been a surgeon.”\n\n“It is a question of hydraulics, you see,” he answered, smiling faintly. “It was an accident, I presume?”\n\n“No.”\n\n“What! a murderous attack?”\n\n“Very murderous indeed.”\n\nHe said it in a quiet, steady voice, but I could see the white line of pain about his lips as I cleansed, dressed, and bandaged the ugly wound.\n\n---\n\n**End of Segment**",

MAJOR STRUCTURAL ISSUES:\n- The completion invents a setting (the consulting room) and additional emotional descriptions (such as the young man’s laughter and sheepish glance) that are not present in the original passage.\n- The completion omits the original’s dialogue exchange about the nature of the injury (the question and answer sequence regarding whether it was an accident or a murderous attack), which is a significant structural component.\n\n2. MISSING ELEMENTS:\n- The completion does not include the original’s description of the patient’s state after the outburst, specifically the details about his weariness and pallor before he speaks.\n- The sequence where the patient explicitly states he has been making a fool of himself is altered and lacks the original’s self-deprecating tone.\n- The completion omits the detailed step-by-step recounting of how the patient managed the bleeding, including the specific mention of tying the handkerchief and bracing it with a twig.\n- The original’s exchange about the patient’s actions being worthy of a surgeon and the reference to hydraulics is condensed and loses the back-and-forth nature of the conversation.\n- The final portion, where the narrator describes the process of cleaning, dressing, and bandaging the wound, is summarized and lacks the original’s specific mention of materials and the patient’s reaction during the procedure.\n\n3. INACCURATE ELEMENTS:\n- The completion introduces inaccurate emotional responses, such as laughter and a sheepish glance, which are not present in the original.\n- The sequence of events is altered: the completion has the narrator pressing a glass into the patient’s hand before the patient’s self-reflection, whereas in the original, the drink is offered after the patient’s admission of foolishness.\n- The completion attributes the injury to the left hand, which is not specified in the original.\n- The dialogue about the nature of the injury is condensed and rephrased, losing the original’s stepwise escalation from accident to murderous attack.\n- The patient’s reaction to the wound being treated is generalized as stoicism, rather than the more nuanced description of him biting his lip but not wincing."

Are you ill?\"\n\nHolmes shook his head impatiently. \"No, Watson, I am not ill. It is nothing—nothing of consequence. Only a passing weakness. I have been working hard lately, and perhaps I have overtaxed myself.\"\n\nI looked at him keenly. His face was haggard, and there were dark shadows under his eyes. It was clear that he had been suffering from want of rest and perhaps from want of food as well. I made up my mind to see that he took better care of himself in the future.\n\n\"You must not work so hard, Holmes,\" I said. \"You are doing too much.\"\n\nHe smiled faintly. \"It is my business to know what other people do not know. But you are right, Watson. I shall try to be more careful.\"\n\nHe rose from his chair and began to pace up and down the room, his hands clasped behind his back, his head sunk upon his breast.

In this case, the silence of the dog suggested that the intruder was someone familiar to it.”\n\nI nodded, following his reasoning. “So you deduced that the perpetrator was not a stranger to the household.”\n\n“Precisely.

By profession I am a hydraulic engineer, and I have had considerable experience of my work during the seven years that I was apprenticed to Venner & Matheson, the well-known firm, of Greenwich. Two years ago, having served my time, and having also come into a fair sum of money through my poor father’s death, I determined to start in business for myself and took professional chambers in Victoria Street.\n“I suppose that everyone finds his first independent start in business a dreary experience. To me it has been exceptionally so. During two years I have had three consultations and one small job, and that is absolutely all that my profession has brought me. My gross takings amount to £ 27 10s. Every day, from nine in the morning until four in the afternoon, I waited in my little den, until at last my heart began to sink, and I came to believe that I should never have any practice at all.\n“Yesterday, however, just as I was thinking of leaving the office, my clerk entered to say there was a gentleman waiting who wished to see me upon business. He brought up a card, too, with the name of ‘Colonel Lysander Stark’ engraved upon it. Close at his heels came the colonel himself, a man rather over the middle size, but of an exceeding thinness. I do not think that I have ever seen so thin a man. His whole face sharpened away into nose and chin, and the skin of his cheeks was drawn quite tense over his outstanding bones. Yet this emaciation seemed to be his natural habit, and due to no disease, for his eye was bright, his step brisk, and his bearing assured. He was plainly but neatly dressed, and his age, I should judge, would be nearer forty than thirty.\n“‘Mr. Hatherley?’ said he, with something of a German accent. ‘You have been recommended to me, Mr. Hatherley, as being a man who is not only proficient in his profession but is also discreet and capable of preserving a secret.’\n“I bowed, feeling as flattered as any young man would at such an address. ‘May I ask who it was who gave me so good a character?’\n“‘Well, perhaps it is better that I should not tell you that just at this moment. I have it from the same source that you are both an orphan and a bachelor and are residing alone in London.’\n“‘That is quite correct,’ I answered; ‘but you will excuse me if I say that I cannot see how all this bears upon my professional qualifications. I understand that it was on a professional matter that you wished to speak to me?’\n“‘Undoubtedly so. But you will find that all I say is really to the point. I have a professional commission for you, but absolute secrecy is quite essential—absolute secrecy, you understand, and of course we may expect that more from a man who is alone than from one who lives in the bosom of his family.’\n“‘If I promise to keep a secret,’ said I, ‘you may absolutely depend upon my doing so.’\n“He looked very hard at me as I spoke, and it seemed to me that I had never seen so suspicious and questioning an eye.\n“‘Do you promise, then?’ said he at last.\n“‘Yes, I promise.’\n“‘Absolute and complete silence before, during, and after? No reference to the matter at all, either in word or writing?’\n“‘I have already given you my word.’\n“‘Very good.’ He suddenly sprang up, and darting like lightning across the room he flung open the door. The passage outside was empty.\n“‘That’s all right,’ said he, coming back. ‘I know that clerks are sometimes curious as to their master’s affairs. Now we can talk in safety.’ He drew up his chair very close to mine and began to stare at me again with the same questioning and thoughtful look.\n“A feeling of repulsion, and of something akin to fear had begun to rise within me at the strange antics of this fleshless man. Even my dread of losing a client could not restrain me from showing my impatience.\n“‘I beg that you will state your business, sir,’ said I; ‘my time is of value.’ Heaven forgive me for that last sentence, but the words came to my lips.\n“‘How would fifty guineas for a night’s work suit you?’ he asked.\n“‘Most admirably.’\n“‘I say a night’s work, but an hour’s would be nearer the mark. I simply want your opinion about a hydraulic stamping machine which has got out of gear. If you show us what is wrong we shall soon set it right ourselves. What do you think of such a commission as that?’\n“‘The work appears to be light and the pay munificent.’\n“‘Precisely so. We shall want you to come to-night by the last train.’\n“‘Where to?’\n“‘To Eyford, in Berkshire. It is a little place near the borders of Oxfordshire, and within seven miles of Reading. There is a train from Paddington which would bring you there at about 11:15.’\n“‘Very good.’\n“‘I shall come down in a carriage to meet you.’\n“‘There is a drive, then?’\n“‘Yes, our little place is quite out in the country. It is a good seven miles from Eyford Station.’\n“‘Then we can hardly get there before midnight. I suppose there would be no chance of a train back. I should be compelled to stop the night.’\n“‘Yes, we could easily give you a shake-down.’\n“‘That is very awkward. Could I not come at some more convenient hour?’\n“‘We have judged it best that you should come late. It is to recompense you for any inconvenience that we are paying to you, a young and unknown man, a fee which would buy an opinion from the very heads of your profession. Still, of course, if you would like to draw out of the business, there is plenty of time to do so.’\n“I thought of the fifty guineas, and of how very useful they would be to me. ‘Not at all,’ said I, ‘I shall be very happy to accommodate myself to your wishes. I should like, however, to understand a little more clearly what it is that you wish me to do.’\n“‘Quite so. It is very natural that the pledge of secrecy which we have exacted from you should have aroused your curiosity. I have no wish to commit you to anything without your having it all laid before you. I suppose that we are absolutely safe from eavesdroppers?’\n“‘Entirely.’\n“‘Then the matter stands thus. You are probably aware that fuller’s-earth is a valuable product, and that it is only found in one or two places in England?’\n“‘I have heard so.’\n“‘Some little time ago I bought a small place—a very small place—within ten miles of Reading. I was fortunate enough to discover that there was a deposit of fuller’s-earth in one of my fields. On examining it, however, I found that this deposit was a comparatively small one, and that it formed a link between two very much larger ones upon the right and left—both of them, however, in the grounds of my neighbours. These good people were absolutely ignorant that their land contained that which was quite as valuable as a gold-mine. Naturally, it was to my interest to buy their land before they discovered its true value, but unfortunately I had no capital by which I could do this. I took a few of my friends into the secret, however, and they suggested that we should quietly and secretly work our own little deposit and that in this way we should earn the money which would enable us to buy the neighbouring fields. This we have now been doing for some time, and in order to help us in our operations we erected a hydraulic press. This press, as I have already explained, has got out of order, and we wish your advice upon the subject. We guard our secret very jealously, however, and if it once became known that we had hydraulic engineers coming to our little house, it would soon rouse inquiry, and then, if the facts came out, it would be good-bye to any chance of getting these fields and carrying out our plans. That is why I have made you promise me that you will not tell a human being that you are going to Eyford to-night. I hope that I make it all plain?’\n“‘I quite follow you,’ said I. ‘The only point which I could not quite understand was what use you could make of a hydraulic press in excavating fuller’s-earth, which, as I understand, is dug out like gravel from a pit.’\n“‘Ah!’ said he carelessly, ‘we have our own process. We compress the earth into bricks, so as to remove them without revealing what they are. But that is a mere detail. I have taken you fully into my confidence now, Mr. Hatherley, and I have shown you how I trust you.’ He rose as he spoke. ‘I shall expect you, then, at Eyford at 11:15.’\n“‘I shall certainly be there.’\n“‘And not a word to a soul.’ He looked at me with a last long, questioning gaze, and then, pressing my hand in a cold, dank grasp, he hurried from the room.",

            "prefix-probing": "I have no near relations, and my whole life, save for an occasional visit to a watering-place or a week’s shooting in Norfolk, has been spent in the metropolis. My habits are regular, and as I am a man of independent means, I have no occupation which compels me to leave home. I am fond of reading, and I have a small collection of rare and curious books. It is my custom to spend the evenings in my study, and I seldom go out after dark. My landlady, Mrs. Hudson, is a worthy woman, and she has looked after me for many years. I have always found her honest and attentive, and I have never had cause to complain of her in any way.\n\nAbout three weeks ago, on a Monday evening, I was sitting in my study, reading an old volume of essays, when I heard a knock at the door. I laid down my book and went to see who it was. To my surprise, I found a stranger standing on the doorstep. He was a man of middle height, with a thin, eager face, and he wore a long, dark overcoat. He seemed somewhat agitated, and he glanced nervously over his shoulder as I opened the door.\n\n\"Mr. John Openshaw?\" he asked.\n\n\"That is my name,\" I replied.\n\n\"May I come in? I have something of importance to say to you.\"\n\nI hesitated for a moment, for the man’s manner was strange, but his earnestness prevailed, and I led him into my study. He took the chair which I offered him, and I sat down opposite.\n\n\"I must apologize for this intrusion,\" he began, \"but I have come to you on a matter of the utmost urgency. You are, I believe, the nephew of the late Elias Openshaw?\"\n\n\"I am,\" I answered, with some surprise.\n\n\"And the heir to his estate?\"\n\n\"That is so. My uncle died some years ago, and I succeeded to his property.\"\n\nThe stranger drew a deep breath, as though a weight had been lifted from his mind.\n\n\"Then I have come to the right man,\" he said. \"Mr. Openshaw, you are in danger.\"\n\nI stared at him in astonishment. \"In danger? From whom?\"\n\n\"From those who killed your uncle.\"\n\nI felt a chill run down my spine. \"My uncle’s death was an accident,\" I said. \"He was found drowned in the garden pond. The coroner’s verdict was ‘accidental death.’\"\n\nThe stranger shook his head. \"It was no accident. Your uncle was murdered. And unless you take precautions, you may share his fate.\"\n\nI was silent for a moment, trying to collect my thoughts. \"You must explain yourself,\" I said at last. \"What makes you think my uncle was murdered? And why should I be in danger?\"\n\nThe man leaned forward, lowering his voice. \"Have you ever heard of the Ku Klux Klan?\"\n\nI started. \"The Ku Klux Klan? I have read of them in the papers. They are a secret society in America, are they not?\"\n\n\"They are more than that,\" he said grimly. \"They are a band of murderers, and your uncle was once one of them.\"\n\nI could not believe what I was hearing. \"My uncle? A member of the Ku Klux Klan? That is impossible!\"\n\n\"It is true. Years ago, when he lived in the South, he joined their ranks. But he quarrelled with them, and he fled to England to escape their vengeance. For a time, he was safe. But they never forget, Mr. Openshaw. They never forgive.\"\n\nI was beginning to feel alarmed. \"But what has all this to do with me?\"\n\n\"Everything. You are his heir. You have inherited not only his property, but also his enemies.\"\n\nI tried to laugh it off, but the man’s earnestness was infectious. \"What do you advise me to do?\"\n\n\"Leave England. Go abroad. Disappear. It is your only chance.\"\n\nI shook my head. \"I cannot do that. My life is here.\"\n\nThe stranger rose to his feet. \"Then be on your guard. Watch every stranger who approaches you. Trust no one. And if you receive any warning, however trivial it may seem, take it seriously.\"\n\nHe turned to go, but at the door he paused. \"Remember what I have said. The Ku Klux Klan never forgets.\"\n\nWith that, he was gone. I stood for some minutes, lost in thought. The whole affair seemed so fantastic that I could hardly believe it. And yet, there was something in the man’s manner which convinced me that he was in earnest.\n\nFor the next few days, I was more than usually cautious. I avoided strangers, and I kept a loaded revolver in my desk. But nothing happened, and gradually I began to think that the whole thing was a delusion. Then, on the following Monday, I received a letter. It was addressed in a strange hand, and it bore the postmark of East London. Inside was a single sheet of paper, on which were written five little orange pips.\n\nI stared at them in bewilderment. Then I remembered the stranger’s warning. I took the letter to the police, but they could make nothing of it. They advised me to take no notice, and to go about my business as usual.\n\nBut I could not shake off the feeling of impending danger. I wrote to you, Mr. Holmes, because I do not know where else to turn. I beg you to help me.\"\n\nSherlock Holmes had listened to this strange story with the keenest attention. His face was grave, and his eyes shone with a peculiar light.\n\n\"You have done wisely,\" he said at last. \"But you must not lose heart. There is always a way out of the most hopeless situation. Let me see the letter.\"\n\nI handed it to him. He examined it carefully, holding it up to the light and scrutinizing the postmark.\n\n\"East London,\" he murmured. \"And the handwriting is peculiar. It is not the hand of an educated man. The paper is of cheap quality. And these orange pips—what do you make of them, Watson?\"\n\nI shook my head. \"I have never seen anything like it.\"\n\n\"Nor have I. But I have heard of such things. In the South of the United States, it is a common practice among certain secret societies to send a warning in this form. The orange pips are a symbol of death.\"\n\nI shuddered. \"What is to be done?\"\n\n\"We must act at once. You must not remain in your lodgings another night. I will arrange for you to stay at a hotel, where you will be safe. In the meantime, I will make inquiries.\"\n\nHe rose and rang the bell. \"Mrs. Hudson, please bring me my coat and hat. I must go out at once.\"\n\nAs he left the room, I turned to Mr. Openshaw. \"You may rely on Holmes,\" I said. \"He has solved many cases which seemed hopeless.\"\n\nOpenshaw smiled faintly. \"I hope he can help me. I have a feeling that my life depends on it.\"\n\nWhen Holmes returned, he was thoughtful. \"I have made some inquiries,\" he said. \"There have been other cases of this kind. In each instance, the recipient of the orange pips met with a violent death within a few days. We must be on our guard.\"\n\nHe spent the rest of the evening questioning Openshaw about his uncle’s past, and making notes in his little black book. At last, he rose and stretched himself.\n\n\"You must go to the hotel at once,\" he said. \"I will call for you in the morning.\"\n\nOpenshaw thanked him and departed. Holmes and I sat in silence for some time.\n\n\"This is a most singular case, Watson,\" he said at last. \"I have a theory, but I must have more facts before I can act.\"\n\nThe next morning, we called at the hotel, but to our dismay, we learned that Openshaw had gone out early and had not returned. We waited for some hours, but there was no sign of him. At last, a messenger arrived with terrible news. Openshaw’s body had been found in the Thames. He had been drowned, just as his uncle had been.\n\nHolmes was deeply moved. \"I should have foreseen this,\" he said bitterly. \"But I will not rest until I have brought his murderers to justice.\"\n\nHe spent the next few days in feverish activity, tracing every clue, and following up every lead. At last, his efforts were rewarded. He discovered that a ship called the ‘Lone Star’ had sailed from London on the very night of Openshaw’s death. On board were three men, all Americans, and all known to have been members of the Ku Klux Klan.\n\nHolmes acted at once. He sent a telegram to the police in Savannah, Georgia, warning them to arrest the men on their arrival. He also sent a letter, enclosing five orange pips, as a warning to the murderers.\n\nSome weeks later, we received news that the ‘Lone Star’ had been lost at sea, with all hands. Holmes was silent for a long time. At last, he spoke.\n\n\"I sent the pips to them, Watson. It was my little message of retribution.\"\n\nAnd so ended the case of the Five Orange Pips."

He was a man of about fifty, with a square, strong face, and a manner which was brisk and business-like. He introduced me to his office, which was in a small side-street off Fenchurch Street. There he gave me a chair, a table, and a large ledger, and bade me copy out certain figures for several hours. This I did, and was surprised to find how easy the work was. At the end of the day he gave me a sovereign, and told me to come again at the same hour every morning. I did so, and for several days I was engaged in the same manner, copying out figures and adding up columns. It was not particularly interesting, but the pay was good, and I had no reason to complain.\n\nOn the fourth day, however, as I was entering the office, I saw a man whom I had never seen before talking to my employer. He was a tall, dark man, with a heavy moustache and a curious way of looking at me out of the corners of his eyes. As I passed him he gave a slight nod, and I could not help thinking that there was something sinister in his appearance. My employer introduced him as Mr. Harris, and said that he would be joining us in the office for a few days. Mr. Harris took a seat at another table, and began to write busily. For some time we worked in silence, but I could not help glancing at him from time to time, and I noticed that he was watching me very closely. I began to feel uneasy, and wondered what his business could be."

MISSING ELEMENTS:\n- The completion omits the detail about the material of the woman's dress and how the light reflects off it, which is an important descriptive element in the original.\n- The original includes the colonel whispering to the woman and then pushing her back into the room she came from, which is not accurately represented in the completion.\n\n3. INACCURATE ELEMENTS:\n- The completion inaccurately attributes a question in a specific language to the woman, which is not specified in the original.\n- The sequence of actions between the colonel and the woman is altered: in the completion, the woman is said to disappear into the darkness, whereas in the original, she is pushed back into the room she came from.\n- The completion adds a description of the room's air and its use, which is not found in the original.\n- The completion omits the detail about the lamp being placed on a specific piece of furniture beside the door until later, which affects the flow of events.\n\nTo improve, focus on maintaining the original sequence of events, avoid inventing dialogue or reactions, and ensure all descriptive and action details are preserved as in the source material."

Once or twice I hazarded some remark to break the monotony of the journey, but the Colonel answered brusquely and sank back into his own thoughts. Presently, however, as we drove through a dark and lonely country lane, I became aware that the carriage was slowing down. The Colonel leaned forward and peered out into the darkness, as if searching for some landmark. \n\nAt length we turned sharply off the main road and entered a narrow, winding track, bordered on either side by high hedges. The wheels of the carriage grated over the loose stones, and the horses' hooves echoed dully in the stillness of the night. I could see nothing of our surroundings, for the moon was obscured by clouds, and the only light came from the lantern which swung from the carriage. \n\nAfter a few minutes, we drew up before a large, low building, which I could just discern through the gloom. The Colonel sprang out and assisted me to alight. He led the way to the door, which was opened at his knock by a small, wizened man with a lantern in his hand. The Colonel exchanged a few words with him in a language which I did not understand, and then beckoned me to follow him inside. \n\nWe passed through a long, dimly-lit passage, and then into a large room, furnished in a curious, old-fashioned style. A lamp stood on the table, and its light fell upon the pale, anxious face of a woman who was seated by the fireplace. She rose as we entered, and I saw that she was young and strikingly handsome, though her expression was one of deep distress. \n\n\"This is my wife,\" said the Colonel, introducing me. \"You will excuse her anxiety, Dr. Watson, for she is not used to strangers in the house.\"\n\nThe lady bowed slightly, but did not speak. The Colonel then turned to me and said, \"If you will be so good as to follow me, I will show you the machine which requires your attention.\"\n\nHe led me through another passage and down a flight of stone steps into a large, vaulted chamber, the walls of which were lined with curious machinery. The air was heavy with the smell of oil and metal, and the only sound was the ticking of a great clock in the corner. The Colonel pointed to a complicated piece of apparatus in the centre of the room.\n\n\"This is the press,\" he said. \"It has been giving us some trouble lately, and I should be glad if you would examine it.\"\n\nI bent over the machine and began to inspect it, but I was conscious all the time of the Colonel's keen eyes fixed upon me. There was something in his manner which made me uneasy, and I could not shake off the feeling that I was being watched and judged."

Then I walked across to the window, hoping that I might catch some glimpse of the country-side, but an oak shutter, heavily barred, was folded across it. It was a wonderfully silent house. There was an old clock ticking loudly somewhere in the passage, but otherwise everything was deadly still. A vague feeling of uneasiness began to steal over me. Who were these German people, and what were they doing living in this strange, out-of-the-way place? And where was the place? I was ten miles or so from Eyford, that was all I knew, but whether north, south, east, or west I had no idea. For that matter, Reading, and possibly other large towns, were within that radius, so the place might not be so secluded, after all. Yet it was quite certain, from the absolute stillness, that we were in the country. I paced up and down the room, humming a tune under my breath to keep up my spirits and feeling that I was thoroughly earning my fifty-guinea fee.\n“Suddenly, without any preliminary sound in the midst of the utter stillness, the door of my room swung slowly open. The woman was standing in the aperture, the darkness of the hall behind her, the yellow light from my lamp beating upon her eager and beautiful face. I could see at a glance that she was sick with fear, and the sight sent a chill to my own heart. She held up one shaking finger to warn me to be silent, and she shot a few whispered words of broken English at me, her eyes glancing back, like those of a frightened horse, into the gloom behind her.\n“‘I would go,’ said she, trying hard, as it seemed to me, to speak calmly; ‘I would go. I should not stay here. There is no good for you to do.’\n“‘But, madam,’ said I, ‘I have not yet done what I came for. I cannot possibly leave until I have seen the machine.’\n“‘It is not worth your while to wait,’ she went on. ‘You can pass through the door; no one hinders.’ And then, seeing that I smiled and shook my head, she suddenly threw aside her constraint and made a step forward, with her hands wrung together. ‘For the love of Heaven!’ she whispered, ‘get away from here before it is too late!’\n“But I am somewhat headstrong by nature, and the more ready to engage in an affair when there is some obstacle in the way. I thought of my fifty-guinea fee, of my wearisome journey, and of the unpleasant night which seemed to be before me. Was it all to go for nothing? Why should I slink away without having carried out my commission, and without the payment which was my due? This woman might, for all I knew, be a monomaniac. With a stout bearing, therefore, though her manner had shaken me more than I cared to confess, I still shook my head and declared my intention of remaining where I was. She was about to renew her entreaties when a door slammed overhead, and the sound of several footsteps was heard upon the stairs. She listened for an instant, threw up her hands with a despairing gesture, and vanished as suddenly and as noiselessly as she had come.\n“The newcomers were Colonel Lysander Stark and a short thick man with a chinchilla beard growing out of the creases of his double chin, who was introduced to me as Mr. Ferguson.\n“‘This is my secretary and manager,’ said the colonel. ‘By the way, I was under the impression that I left this door shut just now. I fear that you have felt the draught.’\n“‘On the contrary,’ said I, ‘I opened the door myself because I felt the room to be a little close.’\n“He shot one of his suspicious looks at me. ‘Perhaps we had better proceed to business, then,’ said he. ‘Mr. Ferguson and I will take you up to see the machine.’\n“‘I had better put my hat on, I suppose.’\n“‘Oh, no, it is in the house.’\n“‘What, you dig fuller’s-earth in the house?’\n“‘No, no. This is only where we compress it. But never mind that. All we wish you to do is to examine the machine and to let us know what is wrong with it.’",

Holmes, who had been standing by the window, turned and followed my gaze. \n\n\"You observe, Watson, the variety of interests our client possesses,\" he remarked. \"Science and poetry—an unusual combination, but not an impossible one. It is often the case that a mind trained to the rigours of scientific thought finds solace in the imaginative flights of verse.\"\n\nI nodded, though my attention was drawn more to the general air of the room than to its specific contents. The apartment was plainly furnished, yet there was an unmistakable sense of order and precision in the arrangement of every object. The chairs were set at exact angles, the books aligned with mathematical accuracy, and even the curtains hung in perfect folds. It was the room of a man who valued discipline and method.\n\nHolmes moved to the table and picked up one of the German volumes, turning its pages with a practiced hand. \"A treatise on organic chemistry,\" he observed. \"And this—ah, a collection of Heine's poems. Our client is evidently a man of culture as well as science.\"\n\nHe replaced the books and turned his attention to the notebook. Opening it, he scanned a few lines, then closed it with a thoughtful expression. \"Private memoranda, Watson. Nothing of immediate relevance, but it is always instructive to note the habits of our clients.\"\n\nAt that moment, the door opened and a tall, thin man entered. He was dressed in a manner that suggested both refinement and practicality—a well-cut suit, but with the cuffs slightly frayed, and a watch-chain of modest design. His face was pale and angular, with deep-set eyes that seemed to miss nothing.\n\n\"Mr. Holmes?\" he inquired, his voice low and precise.\n\n\"I am he. This is my friend and colleague, Dr. Watson. Pray, be seated.\"\n\nThe man inclined his head and took the chair Holmes indicated. For a moment, he seemed to collect his thoughts, his long fingers drumming lightly on the arm of the chair.\n\n\"You have my letter, I presume?\" he asked.\n\n\"I have it here,\" Holmes replied, producing a folded sheet from his pocket. \"You wrote that you are in need of my assistance in a matter of some delicacy.\"\n\nThe man nodded. \"It is a matter which, if mishandled, could bring ruin not only upon myself, but upon others whose names I am bound to protect.\"\n\nHolmes leaned forward, his keen eyes fixed upon the visitor. \"You may speak freely here, sir. Dr. Watson is a man of honour, and whatever you say will go no further.\"\n\nThe man hesitated, then began his tale. \"My name is Wilhelm von Ebersdorf. I am a lecturer in chemistry at the university. For some months now, I have been the recipient of certain anonymous communications—letters, unsigned, but written in a hand I do not recognise. At first, they were merely curious, containing cryptic references to my work and my past. But of late, they have grown more threatening.\"\n\n\"Threatening in what way?\" Holmes asked.\n\n\"They allude to an incident in my youth—a foolish indiscretion, long since repented and, I had thought, forgotten. The writer claims to possess evidence which could, if made public, destroy my reputation and my career.\"\n\nHolmes steepled his fingers. \"And you have no idea who this person might be?\"\n\nVon Ebersdorf shook his head. \"None. I have racked my brains, but I can think of no one who would bear me such ill-will.\"\n\n\"May I see the letters?\"\n\nThe visitor produced a small packet from his breast pocket and handed it to Holmes, who examined the contents with care. The handwriting was bold and angular, the language precise, almost pedantic. Holmes read through the letters in silence, then passed them to me.\n\n\"You will observe, Watson, the peculiar formation of the letter 'g', and the consistent use of the Oxford comma. These are not the habits of an uneducated man.\"\n\nI nodded, noting the details Holmes had indicated.\n\n\"Have you noticed anyone watching you, or any unusual occurrences of late?\" Holmes inquired.\n\nVon Ebersdorf shook his head. \"Nothing that I can recall. My life is a quiet one—lectures, research, and the occasional evening at the theatre.\"\n\nHolmes sat back, his eyes half-closed. \"We shall look into this matter, Mr. von Ebersdorf. In the meantime, I advise you to go about your business as usual, and to make no mention of our involvement to anyone.\"\n\nThe visitor rose, relief evident in his expression. \"Thank you, Mr. Holmes. I am in your debt.\"\n\nWhen he had gone, Holmes turned to me with a smile. \"A curious case, Watson. I suspect that the solution will be found not in the laboratory, but in the heart. Come, let us see what the city has to offer by way of clues.\""

An examination showed that one of the india-rubber bands which was round the head of a driving-rod had shrunk so as not quite to fill the socket along which it worked. This was clearly the cause of the loss of power, and I pointed it out to my companions, who followed my remarks very carefully and asked several practical questions as to how they should proceed to set it right. When I had made it clear to them, I returned to the main chamber of the machine and took a good look at it to satisfy my own curiosity. It was obvious at a glance that the story of the fuller’s-earth was the merest fabrication, for it would be absurd to suppose that so powerful an engine could be designed for so inadequate a purpose. The walls were of wood, but the floor consisted of a large iron trough, and when I came to examine it I could see a crust of metallic deposit all over it. I had stooped and was scraping at this to see exactly what it was when I heard a muttered exclamation in German and saw the cadaverous face of the colonel looking down at me.\n“‘What are you doing there?’ he asked.\n“I felt angry at having been tricked by so elaborate a story as that which he had told me. ‘I was admiring your fuller’s-earth,’ said I; ‘I think that I should be better able to advise you as to your machine if I knew what the exact purpose was for which it was used.’\n“The instant that I uttered the words I regretted the rashness of my speech. His face set hard, and a baleful light sprang up in his grey eyes.\n“‘Very well,’ said he, ‘you shall know all about the machine.’ He took a step backward, slammed the little door, and turned the key in the lock.

Specifically, the colonel does not physically seize or throw the narrator, nor is there a direct accusation about the material being gold.\n- The completion omits the narrator's internal reaction of regret after making a revealing comment, which is present in the original.\n- The completion adds a scene where the colonel laughs and walks away, which is not part of the original sequence.\n\n2. MISSING ELEMENTS:\n- The completion omits the narrator's careful observation of his companions and the specific mention of keeping a keen eye on them due to earlier warnings.\n- The process of examining the machine is less detailed; the original includes a step-by-step technical diagnosis, including the narrator's actions with the levers and the identification of a specific mechanical issue.\n- The original contains a moment where the narrator points out the mechanical problem to his companions and answers their questions, which is missing in the completion.\n- The narrator's return to the main chamber and his curiosity-driven examination of the floor are not fully represented.\n- The original includes a muttered exclamation in a foreign language and a description of the colonel's expression, which are not present in the completion.\n\n3. INACCURATE ELEMENTS:\n- The completion inaccurately describes the sequence of discovering and fixing the machine's fault; in the original, the narrator does not repair the machine but only identifies the issue.\n- The completion attributes dialogue and actions to the colonel and narrator that do not occur, such as a direct accusation about gold and a warning about consequences.\n- The completion changes the nature of the door and the narrator's attempts to escape, describing it as solid iron and omitting the original's description of the narrator's efforts.\n- The completion alters the sequence of events, with the confrontation and locking in the chamber happening differently than in the original passage."

            "prefix-probing": "The corridor was long and carpeted, with doors on either side, and at the far end a window with heavy curtains drawn against the night. The colonel walked with a firm step, the lamp held high, casting grotesque shadows on the walls. The manager, breathing heavily from the exertion, kept glancing nervously at the doors as we passed. I followed, my senses alert, for Holmes had taught me to observe even the smallest detail.\n\nAt the third door on the left, the colonel paused. He turned the key in the lock and pushed the door open. The room within was spacious, with a large bed in the centre, a writing desk by the window, and a wardrobe against the far wall. The air was heavy with the scent of tobacco and something else—perhaps a trace of perfume. The lamp’s light flickered over the furnishings, revealing nothing out of the ordinary at first glance.\n\n“Here we are, gentlemen,” said the colonel, his voice steady but with a hint of tension. “This is the room where the incident occurred.”\n\nThe manager stepped forward, wringing his hands. “It was just after midnight, sir, when the maid heard the commotion. She was passing in the corridor and said she heard voices raised in anger, then a sudden crash.”\n\nI moved to the window and drew back the curtain. The glass was unbroken, and the latch secure. Outside, the garden was shrouded in darkness, the only light coming from a distant street lamp. I turned back to the room, noting the position of the furniture. The bedclothes were rumpled, as if someone had risen hastily. On the writing desk, a blotter, a pen, and a half-written letter lay undisturbed.\n\nHolmes would have examined the carpet for footprints, the dust on the wardrobe for disturbances, the ash in the tray for clues to the smoker’s identity. I did my best to emulate his methods, kneeling to inspect the floor near the bed. There, I found a small, dark stain—perhaps blood, or spilled wine. I pointed it out to the colonel, who nodded grimly.\n\n“That was not there before,” he said. “I am certain of it.”\n\nThe manager shivered. “It is all most mysterious, sir. The guest, Mr. Harrington, was a quiet man, kept to himself. No one saw anyone enter or leave his room after dinner.”\n\nI straightened and moved to the wardrobe. Opening it, I found a row of neatly hung suits, a pair of polished shoes, and a travelling bag. The bag was locked, but the key hung from a ribbon on the handle. I opened it and found only clothing and a few personal effects—nothing to suggest a motive for violence or theft.\n\nThe colonel set the lamp on the desk and surveyed the room. “You see, Doctor, there is nothing here to explain what happened. Yet Mr. Harrington is gone, vanished without a trace.”\n\nI considered the facts. The locked window, the undisturbed door, the absence of any sign of struggle save for the stain on the carpet. It was a puzzle worthy of Holmes himself.\n\n“Was anything taken from the room?” I asked.\n\nThe manager shook his head. “Nothing that we can determine, sir. His watch, his wallet, even his cufflinks are all here.”\n\nI examined the letter on the desk. It was addressed to a Miss Violet Hunter, and read:\n\n“My dear Miss Hunter,\n\nI trust this note finds you well. I have arrived safely and the accommodations are most satisfactory. I look forward to our meeting on Thursday, as arranged. Until then, I remain—”\n\nThe letter ended abruptly, the pen trailing off as if interrupted. I showed it to the colonel, who frowned.\n\n“He must have been writing when—whatever happened—occurred,” he said.\n\nI nodded. “It would seem so. Tell me, was there any sign of forced entry?”\n\n“None at all,” replied the manager. “The door was locked from the inside when we found it. We had to use the master key to enter.”\n\nI glanced once more around the room, searching for anything I might have missed. The silence was oppressive, broken only by the ticking of a clock on the mantelpiece. I could not help but feel that the answer was here, hidden in plain sight, waiting for the keen eye of Sherlock Holmes to uncover it."

          "text_segment": "‘Hullo!’ I yelled. ‘Hullo! Colonel! Let me out!’\n“And then suddenly in the silence I heard a sound which sent my heart into my mouth. It was the clank of the levers and the swish of the leaking cylinder. He had set the engine at work. The lamp still stood upon the floor where I had placed it when examining the trough. By its light I saw that the black ceiling was coming down upon me, slowly, jerkily, but, as none knew better than myself, with a force which must within a minute grind me to a shapeless pulp. I threw myself, screaming, against the door, and dragged with my nails at the lock. I implored the colonel to let me out, but the remorseless clanking of the levers drowned my cries. The ceiling was only a foot or two above my head, and with my hand upraised I could feel its hard, rough surface. Then it flashed through my mind that the pain of my death would depend very much upon the position in which I met it. If I lay on my face the weight would come upon my spine, and I shuddered to think of that dreadful snap. Easier the other way, perhaps; and yet, had I the nerve to lie and look up at that deadly black shadow wavering down upon me? Already I was unable to stand erect, when my eye caught something which brought a gush of hope back to my heart.\n“I have said that though the floor and ceiling were of iron, the walls were of wood. As I gave a last hurried glance around, I saw a thin line of yellow light between two of the boards, which broadened and broadened as a small panel was pushed backward. For an instant I could hardly believe that here was indeed a door which led away from death. The next instant I threw myself through, and lay half-fainting upon the other side. The panel had closed again behind me, but the crash of the lamp, and a few moments afterwards the clang of the two slabs of metal, told me how narrow had been my escape.\n“I was recalled to myself by a frantic plucking at my wrist, and I found myself lying upon the stone floor of a narrow corridor, while a woman bent over me and tugged at me with her left hand, while she held a candle in her right. It was the same good friend whose warning I had so foolishly rejected.\n“‘Come! come!’ she cried breathlessly. ‘They will be here in a moment. They will see that you are not there. Oh, do not waste the so-precious time, but come!’\n“This time, at least, I did not scorn her advice. I staggered to my feet and ran with her along the corridor and down a winding stair. The latter led to another broad passage, and just as we reached it we heard the sound of running feet and the shouting of two voices, one answering the other from the floor on which we were and from the one beneath. My guide stopped and looked about her like one who is at her wit’s end. Then she threw open a door which led into a bedroom, through the window of which the moon was shining brightly.\n“‘It is your only chance,’ said she. ‘It is high, but it may be that you can jump it.’\n“As she spoke a light sprang into view at the further end of the passage, and I saw the lean figure of Colonel Lysander Stark rushing forward with a lantern in one hand and a weapon like a butcher’s cleaver in the other. I rushed across the bedroom, flung open the window, and looked out. How quiet and sweet and wholesome the garden looked in the moonlight, and it could not be more than thirty feet down. I clambered out upon the sill, but I hesitated to jump until I should have heard what passed between my saviour and the ruffian who pursued me. If she were ill-used, then at any risks I was determined to go back to her assistance. The thought had hardly flashed through my mind before he was at the door, pushing his way past her; but she threw her arms round him and tried to hold him back.\n“‘Fritz! Fritz!’ she cried in English, ‘remember your promise after the last time. You said it should not be again. He will be silent! Oh, he will be silent!’\n“‘You are mad, Elise!’ he shouted, struggling to break away from her. ‘You will be the ruin of us. He has seen too much. Let me pass, I say!’ He dashed her to one side, and, rushing to the window, cut at me with his heavy weapon. I had let myself go, and was hanging by the hands to the sill, when his blow fell. I was conscious of a dull pain, my grip loosened, and I fell into the garden below.\n“I was shaken but not hurt by the fall; so I picked myself up and rushed off among the bushes as hard as I could run, for I understood that I was far from being out of danger yet. Suddenly, however, as I ran, a deadly dizziness and sickness came over me. I glanced down at my hand, which was throbbing painfully, and then, for the first time, saw that my thumb had been cut off and that the blood was pouring from my wound. I endeavoured to tie my handkerchief round it, but there came a sudden buzzing in my ears, and next moment I fell in a dead faint among the rose-bushes.",

It was the clank of the levers and the swish of the machinery. The ceiling was coming down! It was within a foot or two of my head. I sprang upon the bench and looked round for some means of escape. The only possible way was through the opening in the wall whence I had entered. I scrambled towards it, but as I did so I heard the panel slide back, and a woman’s voice, more than a woman’s voice—a voice of despair—cried, ‘Quick! Quick!

Fritz! Remember your promise after the last time!’\n\n‘Back!’ he shouted, and, raising the weapon, he struck at me. I felt a dull pain, my grip loosened, and I fell into the garden below.

            "prefix-probing": "To my immense relief, I heard the sound of hurried footsteps approaching from the corridor outside. The key rattled in the lock, and the door swung open to reveal Colonel Lysander Stark, his face pale and drawn, but with a forced smile upon his lips.\n\n‘Ah, Mr. Hatherley,’ he said, ‘I trust you are not hurt? I regret exceedingly that you should have been subjected to this inconvenience. It was a mistake, I assure you. My housekeeper is sometimes overzealous in her duties.’\n\nI stepped out into the passage, my heart still pounding from the fright I had received. ‘I must say, Colonel,’ I replied, ‘that I do not appreciate being locked in a dark room without warning. I came here on a matter of business, and I expect to be treated with courtesy.’\n\nHe bowed apologetically. ‘Of course, of course. Please accept my apologies. The matter is urgent, and I am anxious to proceed. If you will follow me, I shall show you the machine which requires your attention.’\n\nI followed him down the corridor, my suspicions aroused by the strange events of the evening. The house was silent, save for the echo of our footsteps on the tiled floor. We passed several closed doors before arriving at a heavy oak door at the end of the passage. The Colonel produced a key and unlocked it, ushering me into a large, dimly lit room.\n\nIn the centre of the room stood a massive piece of machinery, its brass and steel components gleaming in the lamplight. The Colonel gestured towards it. ‘There, Mr. Hatherley, is the press. It is of the utmost importance that it be repaired tonight. My associates and I have urgent work to complete, and we cannot afford any delay.’\n\nI examined the machine carefully, noting the intricate arrangement of gears and levers. It was a type of hydraulic press, such as I had seen in many workshops, but of a more powerful and elaborate design. I set to work at once, my mind occupied with the task at hand, though I could not shake the feeling of unease that had settled upon me.\n\nAs I worked, the Colonel hovered nearby, watching my every move with an intensity that bordered on the obsessive. From time to time, I caught glimpses of a woman’s figure in the shadows beyond the doorway, her eyes fixed upon me with an expression of anxiety and fear. I wondered what secrets this house concealed, and what danger I might be in.\n\nAt last, after more than an hour’s labour, I succeeded in repairing the fault in the press. I straightened up, wiping the sweat from my brow. ‘It is done, Colonel,’ I said. ‘The machine should now function as intended.’\n\nHe nodded, his face betraying a flicker of satisfaction. ‘Excellent, Mr. Hatherley. You have rendered us a great service. Now, if you will step this way, I shall see you safely out.’\n\nHe led me back through the winding corridors, his manner now more guarded than before. As we approached the front door, the woman I had seen earlier appeared suddenly before us. She spoke rapidly in German, her voice trembling with emotion. The Colonel replied in the same language, his tone harsh and commanding. I could not understand their words, but the meaning was clear: she was warning me of some imminent danger.\n\nBefore I could react, the Colonel seized my arm and dragged me towards the door. ‘You must leave at once, Mr. Hatherley,’ he said, his voice low and urgent. ‘There is no time to lose.’\n\nI stumbled out into the night, the door slamming shut behind me. I found myself alone in the darkness, the chill air biting at my face. I hurried down the drive, my mind racing with questions. What was the true purpose of the machine I had repaired? Who were these people, and what were they hiding?\n\nAs I reached the gate, I heard a sudden commotion behind me. I turned to see the house ablaze with light, figures moving frantically within. A moment later, a great crash echoed through the night, followed by a burst of flame from one of the upper windows. I realized with a shock that the house was on fire.\n\nI ran back towards the house, but the heat and smoke drove me back. I could do nothing but watch as the flames consumed the building, the secrets within lost forever. At last, the fire died down, leaving only a smouldering ruin.\n\nI made my way to the nearest town and reported the events to the police. They listened to my story with incredulity, but a search of the ruins confirmed my account. The remains of the hydraulic press were found among the debris, along with evidence of a clandestine operation.\n\nIt was not until I returned to London and consulted with Mr. Sherlock Holmes that the full truth was revealed. The Colonel and his associates had been engaged in the illicit manufacture of counterfeit coins, using the press I had repaired. The woman was a prisoner, forced to assist in their scheme. My timely intervention had unwittingly brought their enterprise to an end.\n\nHolmes listened to my tale with keen interest, his eyes alight with the thrill of the chase. ‘You have had a narrow escape, Mr. Hatherley,’ he said. ‘But thanks to your courage and resourcefulness, justice has been served.’\n\nI left Baker Street that day with a sense of relief, grateful to have survived my adventure. The memory of that night, however, would haunt me for years to come."

My clothes were all sodden with dew, and my coat-sleeve was drenched with blood from my wounded thumb. The smarting of it recalled in an instant all the particulars of my night’s adventure, and I sprang to my feet with the feeling that I might hardly yet be safe from my pursuers. But to my astonishment, when I came to look round me, neither house nor garden were to be seen. I had been lying in an angle of the hedge close by the high road, and just a little lower down was a long building, which proved, upon my approaching it, to be the very station at which I had arrived upon the previous night. Were it not for the ugly wound upon my hand, all that had passed during those dreadful hours might have been an evil dream.\n“Half dazed, I went into the station and asked about the morning train. There would be one to Reading in less than an hour. The same porter was on duty, I found, as had been there when I arrived. I inquired of him whether he had ever heard of Colonel Lysander Stark. The name was strange to him. Had he observed a carriage the night before waiting for me? No, he had not. Was there a police-station anywhere near? There was one about three miles off.\n“It was too far for me to go, weak and ill as I was. I determined to wait until I got back to town before telling my story to the police. It was a little past six when I arrived, so I went first to have my wound dressed, and then the doctor was kind enough to bring me along here. I put the case into your hands and shall do exactly what you advise.”\nWe both sat in silence for some little time after listening to this extraordinary narrative. Then Sherlock Holmes pulled down from the shelf one of the ponderous commonplace books in which he placed his cuttings.\n“Here is an advertisement which will interest you,” said he. “It appeared in all the papers about a year ago. Listen to this: ‘Lost, on the 9th inst., Mr. Jeremiah Hayling, aged twenty-six, a hydraulic engineer. Left his lodgings at ten o’clock at night, and has not been heard of since. Was dressed in,’ etc., etc. Ha! That represents the last time that the colonel needed to have his machine overhauled, I fancy.”\n“Good heavens!” cried my patient. “Then that explains what the girl said.”\n“Undoubtedly. It is quite clear that the colonel was a cool and desperate man, who was absolutely determined that nothing should stand in the way of his little game, like those out-and-out pirates who will leave no survivor from a captured ship.",

Holmes handed me a glass of water, and I drank it eagerly.\n\n\"What has happened?\" I managed to ask.\n\n\"You have had a narrow escape, Watson,\" he replied gravely. \"You were struck down by a most ruffianly fellow, and it was only by the merest chance that I arrived in time to prevent worse.\"\n\nI tried to recall the events that had led up to my present situation.

This is my point.” He placed his finger in the centre of the circle. “This is where we shall find them.”\n“But the twelve-mile drive?” gasped Hatherley.\n“Six out and six back. Nothing simpler. You say yourself that the horse was fresh and glossy when you got in. How could it be that if it had gone twelve miles over heavy roads?”\n“Indeed, it is a likely ruse enough,” observed Bradstreet thoughtfully. “Of course there can be no doubt as to the nature of this gang.”\n“None at all,” said Holmes. “They are coiners on a large scale, and have used the machine to form the amalgam which has taken the place of silver.”\n“We have known for some time that a clever gang was at work,” said the inspector. “They have been turning out half-crowns by the thousand.

However, we have got a pretty tight hold upon them now.”\n\n“But the house,” said I. “If you have drawn a circle at a radius of ten miles from Eyford, and the place is somewhere on that line, what is the use of our going to Eyford at all?”\n\n“Don’t you see, Watson,” said Holmes, “that we have no evidence to show that the place we are in search of is outside the village? As a matter of fact, I would lay a considerable wager that it is not.”\n\n“You think, then, that it is inside the circle?”\n\n“I am sure of it.”\n\n“Why should they have taken him so far, then?”\n\n“Because they wished to get the impression that they had taken him far, and so throw the police off the scent. It is a common trick. When the horse was brought round, the animal was fresh and glossy. Had it come twelve miles over heavy roads, it would have been covered with foam. Therefore, it had only been exercised for a short time.”\n\n“I see,” said Bradstreet. “Then we shall begin our search at the centre and work outwards.”\n\n“Exactly,” said Holmes. “We shall find the house without much difficulty. I would suggest that we go straight to the village and make inquiries there.”",

The sooner we are at Scotland Yard, the sooner we may be on the trail.\"\n\nI fetched my coat and hat, and together we descended the stairs of Baker Street, Holmes pausing only to snatch up his long, grey travelling cloak and his trusty magnifying glass. The hansom cab was summoned, and in a matter of minutes we were rattling through the busy London streets, Holmes silent and contemplative, his long fingers drumming upon his knee.\n\n\"You have the letter, Holmes?\" I inquired, recalling the missive which had set this adventure in motion.\n\nHe tapped his breast pocket. \"Indeed, Watson. It is the key to the whole affair, I suspect.\"\n\nThe cab drew up before the imposing façade of Scotland Yard, and we were ushered in by a constable who seemed to know Holmes by sight. Inspector Lestrade awaited us in his office, his sharp features betraying both curiosity and a hint of irritation.\n\n\"Ah, Mr. Holmes, Dr. Watson,\" he greeted us. \"I hear you have some information regarding the Eyford matter.\"\n\nHolmes inclined his head. \"I believe I may be of assistance, Inspector. But first, I should like to hear what you have discovered thus far.\"\n\nLestrade gestured for us to sit. \"Not much, I’m afraid. The facts are these: Sir Charles Milverton was found dead in his study at Eyford Hall, the door locked from the inside. No sign of forced entry, no weapon, and no apparent motive. The servants heard nothing.\"\n\nHolmes steepled his fingers. \"And the letter?\"\n\nLestrade frowned. \"A curious thing. A note was found on the desk, unsigned, warning Sir Charles of danger. We have not traced the handwriting.\"\n\nHolmes produced the letter from his pocket. \"I believe this may be of interest. It was sent to me this morning.\"\n\nLestrade took the letter, his eyes widening as he read. \"This is extraordinary, Holmes! It suggests a connection between the victim and a certain Mr. Hatherley, does it not?\"\n\n\"Precisely. And it is for that reason that Dr. Watson and I propose to travel to Eyford at once.\"\n\nLestrade nodded. \"I shall telegraph the local authorities to expect you.\"\n\nWithin the hour, Holmes and I were aboard the train, the countryside flashing past as we sped towards Eyford. Holmes was in high spirits, his mind clearly engaged by the complexities of the case.\n\n\"You see, Watson,\" he remarked, \"the locked room, the anonymous letter, the absence of motive—all point to a most ingenious adversary.\"\n\n\"Do you suspect anyone in particular?\" I asked.\n\nHe smiled enigmatically. \"I have my suspicions, but I prefer to test them upon the scene.\"\n\nAs the train drew into Eyford station, Holmes sprang to his feet. \"Come, Watson!

A house on fire, asked Bradstreet as the train steamed off again on its way. Yes, sir, said the station-master. When did it break out?

No, sir, Dr. Becher is an Englishman, and there isn't a man in the parish who has a better-lined waistcoat. But he has a gentleman staying with him, a patient, as I understand, who is a foreigner, and he—\" \"Thin, with a long nose?\" \"Just so.\" \"Ah!\" cried Hatherley, \"that is my man, if you will come with me I'll show—\" But at that instant the station-master, looking over our heads, cried, \"Here he is, sir!\" and we all turned round to see a man coming rapidly down the road. But it was not the man whom we expected. It was a stout, elderly person, with a red face and a pepper-and-salt suit of tweeds. \"Dr. Becher!\" said Bradstreet. \"Yes, sir, and this is my house,\" he answered. \"Can I be of any service to you?\" \"We were looking for a thin, foreigner, with a long nose,\" said Hatherley. \"Ah!\" said the doctor, with a smile, \"I see that you are the gentleman whom I was expecting. Please come this way.\" But even as he spoke there was a loud crash from the direction of the house, and a burst of flame shot up into the air. The firemen were beating at the flames with their axes, but the whole place was now one sheet of fire. Hatherley, in a frenzy, rushed forward, but Holmes caught him by the arm and held him back. \"Do you wish to perish as well?\" he cried. A little to the right, from the top of a small hill, we could see the whole scene. The house was a large, whitewashed building, standing in its own grounds. A thick column of smoke rose from it, and the flames were leaping up from the roof. The fire-engines were at work, but the water had little effect upon the flames. Hatherley was in a state of wild excitement. \"Look!\" he cried, \"there is the gravel-drive, and there are the rose-bushes where I lay. That is the window from which I escaped. I can even see the mark of my feet upon the corner of the flower-bed! Oh, if I had only had a revolver with me!\" \"You would probably have been buried in the burning house,\" returned Holmes. \"There is no doubt that the fire was started by the lamp being crushed in the press. The gang had probably secured their booty and made off during the night. It is possible that they may have left traces, but I fear that they are far away by now.\" \"I think, Inspector,\" said Hatherley, \"that I should like to have a look at the crowd and see if I can recognize any of these men.\" \"That is a good idea,\" said Holmes, \"but I am afraid that they are not among them.\"",

But he has a gentleman staying with him, a patient, as I understand, who is a foreigner, and he—\" \"Thin, with a long nose?\" \"Just so.\" \"Ah!\" cried Hatherley, \"that is my man, if you will come with me I'll show—\" But at that instant the station-master, looking over our heads, cried, \"Here he is, sir!\" and we all turned round to see a man coming rapidly down the road. But it was not the man whom we expected. It was a stout, elderly person, with a red face and a pepper-and-salt suit of tweeds. \"Dr. Becher!\" said Bradstreet. \"Yes, sir, and this is my house,\" he answered. \"Can I be of any service to you?\" \"We were looking for a thin, foreigner, with a long nose,\" said Hatherley. \"Ah!\" said the doctor, with a smile, \"I see that you are the gentleman whom I was expecting. Please come this way.\" But even as he spoke there was a loud crash from the direction of the house, and a burst of flame shot up into the air. The firemen were beating at the flames with their axes, but the whole place was now one sheet of fire. Hatherley, in a frenzy, rushed forward, but Holmes caught him by the arm and held him back. \"Do you wish to perish as well?\" he cried. A little to the right, from the top of a small hill, we could see the whole scene. The house was a large, whitewashed building, standing in its own grounds. A thick column of smoke rose from it, and the flames were leaping up from the roof. The fire-engines were at work, but the water had little effect upon the flames. Hatherley was in a state of wild excitement. \"Look!\" he cried, \"there is the gravel-drive, and there are the rose-bushes where I lay. That is the window from which I escaped. I can even see the mark of my feet upon the corner of the flower-bed! Oh, if I had only had a revolver with me!\" \"You would probably have been buried in the burning house,\" returned Holmes. \"There is no doubt that the fire was started by the lamp being crushed in the press. The gang had probably secured their booty and made off during the night. It is possible that they may have left traces, but I fear that they are far away by now.\" \"I think, Inspector,\" said Hatherley, \"that I should like to have a look at the crowd and see if I can recognize any of these men.\" \"That is a good idea,\" said Holmes, \"but I am afraid that they are not among them.\"",

It was Holmes himself who, with his characteristic subtlety and foresight, had anticipated every move of the adversaries. The night was dark and the fog hung low over the streets of London, muffling the sounds of the city and lending an air of mystery to the proceedings. Holmes and I had taken up our position in the shadow of a doorway, our eyes fixed upon the dimly lit windows of the house across the street.\n\n\"You see, Watson,\" Holmes whispered, \"the inspector has overlooked a crucial detail. Our quarry is not so foolish as to return by the front entrance. Observe the alleyway to the left.\"\n\nI peered into the gloom, straining my eyes to discern any movement. For a moment, all was still. Then, a shadow detached itself from the darkness and glided silently along the wall. Holmes touched my arm, a signal to remain perfectly still. The figure paused at the corner, glanced furtively about, and then disappeared into the rear of the building.\n\n\"Come, Watson,\" Holmes murmured, and we slipped quietly from our hiding place, making our way along the cobblestones with as little noise as possible. Holmes led the way, his keen senses alert to every sound. We reached the alley just in time to see the shadowy figure vanish through a side door.\n\nHolmes produced a small lantern from his pocket and shielded its light with his hand. We crept forward, the faint glow illuminating the damp bricks and discarded refuse. Inside, we could hear the low murmur of voices. Holmes pressed his ear to the door, his expression intent.\n\n\"They are dividing the spoils,\" he whispered. \"Now is our moment.\"\n\nWith a sudden movement, Holmes pushed open the door and stepped inside. The criminals, startled, sprang to their feet, but Holmes was ready. In a matter of moments, he had disarmed the leader and secured the others with a length of cord he had brought for the purpose. The inspector arrived moments later, breathless and astonished at the scene before him."

Yet, for all our efforts, we are left with nothing but conjecture.\"\n\n\"Do you think, then, that we shall ever learn the truth?\" I asked.\n\nHe shook his head gravely. \"I fear not.

It served, too, as a reminder of the limits of human knowledge, and of the shadows which lie beyond the reach of reason and deduction.\n\nIn the years that followed, Holmes and I were engaged upon many another adventure, some of which taxed our powers to the utmost, but never again did we encounter a problem so haunting in its uncertainty, or so poignant in its suggestion of tragedy. And so, as the fire burned low and the shadows lengthened upon the walls of our sitting-room, we would sometimes fall silent, each occupied with his own thoughts, and I would wonder, as I am sure Holmes did, what fate had overtaken those three unhappy beings who had vanished so completely from the world."

Let me say, however, that in the course of my own investigation into this singular episode, I was able to throw some light upon the events which led up to it, and to clear up the mystery which had so perplexed the public mind. It chanced that I was seated in my rooms at Baker Street one morning, when my friend Sherlock Holmes entered, his keen eyes sparkling with that peculiar excitement which denotes the presence of some unusual problem.\n\n\"You have heard of the St. Simon affair, Watson?\" he asked, tossing a newspaper upon the table.\n\n\"Indeed, I have,\" I replied. \"It has been the talk of the town for days.\"\n\nHolmes smiled. \"It is a case which presents several features of interest. The disappearance of the bride upon the very day of her wedding, the subsequent discovery of her whereabouts, and the explanation of her conduct, all combine to make it a most remarkable affair.\"\n\nI took up the newspaper and glanced at the account. \"It seems,\" I remarked, \"that the lady vanished from the wedding breakfast, and that no trace of her could be found.\"\n\n\"Precisely. And yet, as you will see, the solution was not so difficult as it appeared.\"\n\nHolmes drew his chair closer to the fire and stretched out his long, thin hands to the blaze. \"The facts, as stated, are briefly these. Lord St. Simon, a man of high rank and considerable fortune, was recently married to Miss Hatty Doran, the only daughter of a wealthy American. The ceremony was performed with great pomp and circumstance, and the wedding breakfast was attended by a large and distinguished company. Shortly after the conclusion of the meal, the bride was observed to rise from the table and leave the room. She was not seen again, and all efforts to discover her whereabouts proved unavailing.\"\n\n\"A most extraordinary occurrence,\" I observed.\n\n\"So it appeared. But let us consider the matter more closely. The lady, it seems, had been in a somewhat agitated state during the breakfast, and had exchanged a few words in private with a stranger who was present. This man, it was afterwards ascertained, was an old acquaintance of hers from America.\"\n\n\"You mean to say that she left her husband for this man?\"\n\n\"Not exactly. The truth is even more singular. The man in question was, in fact, her lawful husband, whom she had believed to be dead. His sudden reappearance at the very moment of her marriage to Lord St. Simon naturally produced a profound effect upon her. She felt it her duty to explain the situation to Lord St. Simon, and to return to her first husband.\"\n\n\"A most delicate and painful position for all concerned,\" I remarked.\n\n\"Undoubtedly. But the matter was arranged with as little publicity as possible, and the parties concerned have since gone their several ways.\"\n\nSuch was the curious termination of the Lord St. Simon marriage, and such the explanation which Sherlock Holmes was able to furnish to the world."

Turn over those papers and arrange the extracts in their order of time, while I take a glance as to who our client is.” He picked a red-covered volume from a line of books of reference beside the mantelpiece. “Here he is,” said he, sitting down and flattening it out upon his knee. “‘Lord Robert Walsingham de Vere St. Simon, second son of the Duke of Balmoral.’ Hum! ‘Arms: Azure, three caltrops in chief over a fess sable. Born in 1846.’ He’s forty-one years of age, which is mature for marriage. Was Under-Secretary for the colonies in a late administration. The Duke, his father, was at one time Secretary for Foreign Affairs. They inherit Plantagenet blood by direct descent, and Tudor on the distaff side. Ha! Well, there is nothing very instructive in all this. I think that I must turn to you Watson, for something more solid.”\n“I have very little difficulty in finding what I want,” said I, “for the facts are quite recent, and the matter struck me as remarkable. I feared to refer them to you, however, as I knew that you had an inquiry on hand and that you disliked the intrusion of other matters.”\n“Oh, you mean the little problem of the Grosvenor Square furniture van. That is quite cleared up now—though, indeed, it was obvious from the first. Pray give me the results of your newspaper selections.”\n“Here is the first notice which I can find. It is in the personal column of the Morning Post, and dates, as you see, some weeks back: ‘A marriage has been arranged,’ it says, ‘and will, if rumour is correct, very shortly take place, between Lord Robert St. Simon, second son of the Duke of Balmoral, and Miss Hatty Doran, the only daughter of Aloysius Doran. Esq., of San Francisco, Cal., U.S.A.’ That is all.”\n“Terse and to the point,” remarked Holmes, stretching his long, thin legs towards the fire.\n“There was a paragraph amplifying this in one of the society papers of the same week. Ah, here it is: ‘There will soon be a call for protection in the marriage market, for the present free-trade principle appears to tell heavily against our home product. One by one the management of the noble houses of Great Britain is passing into the hands of our fair cousins from across the Atlantic. An important addition has been made during the last week to the list of the prizes which have been borne away by these charming invaders. Lord St. Simon, who has shown himself for over twenty years proof against the little god’s arrows, has now definitely announced his approaching marriage with Miss Hatty Doran, the fascinating daughter of a California millionaire. Miss Doran, whose graceful figure and striking face attracted much attention at the Westbury House festivities, is an only child, and it is currently reported that her dowry will run to considerably over the six figures, with expectancies for the future. As it is an open secret that the Duke of Balmoral has been compelled to sell his pictures within the last few years, and as Lord St. Simon has no property of his own save the small estate of Birchmoor, it is obvious that the Californian heiress is not the only gainer by an alliance which will enable her to make the easy and common transition from a Republican lady to a British peeress.’”\n“Anything else?” asked Holmes, yawning.\n“Oh, yes; plenty. Then there is another note in the Morning Post to say that the marriage would be an absolutely quiet one, that it would be at St. George’s, Hanover Square, that only half a dozen intimate friends would be invited, and that the party would return to the furnished house at Lancaster Gate which has been taken by Mr. Aloysius Doran. Two days later—that is, on Wednesday last—there is a curt announcement that the wedding had taken place, and that the honeymoon would be passed at Lord Backwater’s place, near Petersfield. Those are all the notices which appeared before the disappearance of the bride.”\n“Before the what?” asked Holmes with a start.\n“The vanishing of the lady.”\n“When did she vanish, then?”\n“At the wedding breakfast.”\n“Indeed. This is more interesting than it promised to be; quite dramatic, in fact.”\n“Yes; it struck me as being a little out of the common.”\n“They often vanish before the ceremony, and occasionally during the honeymoon; but I cannot call to mind anything quite so prompt as this. Pray let me have the details.”",

            "prefix-probing": "That is well. I have no desire to make a mystery of it to you, though, for a short time, I must beg you to allow me to keep my own counsel. At present, yes, at present, I can say nothing; but there is no reason why I should not be perfectly frank with you in the future. I trust that I shall soon be in a position to do so. Meanwhile, you will excuse me if I continue my investigations in my own way.\"\n\nHolmes rose, and, with a gesture of polite dismissal, indicated that the interview was at an end. The client, a tall, nervous man with a troubled expression, gathered his hat and gloves, and with a final, searching look at Holmes, took his leave. The door closed softly behind him, and for a moment there was silence in the room save for the ticking of the clock upon the mantelpiece.\n\n\"Well, Watson,\" said Holmes at length, turning to me with a smile, \"what do you make of our visitor?\"\n\nI considered for a moment. \"He is certainly agitated, Holmes. There is something weighing heavily upon his mind.\"\n\n\"Quite so. And did you observe his hands?\"\n\n\"His hands? No, I cannot say that I did.\"\n\n\"They were stained with ink, and yet his cuffs were scrupulously clean. That is a point of some interest. It suggests that he is accustomed to writing, perhaps for long periods, but is careful of his appearance. A man of letters, perhaps, or a clerk.\"\n\n\"And his manner?\"\n\n\"Nervous, certainly, but not without a certain dignity. He is a man who is used to responsibility, but who is at present under a strain.\"\n\nI nodded. \"And what do you propose to do next?\"\n\nHolmes smiled enigmatically. \"I propose, my dear Watson, to follow the only clue which our visitor has left us.\"\n\nHe crossed to the table and picked up a small scrap of paper which had lain unnoticed until now. \"Observe, Watson, the corner of this note. It was torn from a larger sheet, and the writing is in a hurried, almost desperate hand.\"\n\nI leaned forward to examine it. The words were few, but suggestive: \"Meet me at the usual place. Midnight. Urgent.\"\n\n\"You see, Watson, the plot thickens. Our visitor is not acting alone. There is another party involved, and the meeting is to take place tonight.\"\n\n\"Shall we attend?\" I asked eagerly.\n\nHolmes smiled. \"I think it would be most instructive. But first, let us see what more we can learn.\"\n\nHe seated himself at his desk and began to examine the note with his lens. \"The paper is of a common sort, but the watermark is distinctive. It is manufactured only by one firm in London. That may help us to trace its origin.\"\n\nHe made a note in his pocketbook, then rose and reached for his hat and coat. \"Come, Watson. The game is afoot.\"\n\nWe made our way through the bustling streets of London, Holmes striding ahead with his usual energy, I following close behind. Our first stop was a small stationer's shop in the Strand, where Holmes inquired about the watermark. The proprietor, a sharp-eyed man with a keen memory, was able to tell us that the paper had been sold only to a few clients, one of whom was a certain Mr. James Willoughby.\n\n\"That is our man, Watson,\" Holmes said as we left the shop. \"Or, at least, he is connected to our case.\"\n\nWe made our way to Willoughby's address, a modest house in a quiet street. Holmes knocked, and after a moment the door was opened by a middle-aged woman.\n\n\"Mr. Willoughby?\" Holmes inquired.\n\n\"He is not at home, sir. He left early this morning and has not yet returned.\"\n\n\"Did he say when he would be back?\"\n\n\"No, sir. He seemed in a great hurry.\"\n\nHolmes thanked her and we turned away.\n\n\"It seems, Watson, that we must wait until tonight to learn more.\"\n\nThe day passed slowly. Holmes spent the afternoon in quiet contemplation, occasionally making notes or consulting his files. As the evening drew on, he became more animated.\n\n\"It is time, Watson. Let us go.\"\n\nWe made our way to the appointed place, a shadowy alley off Fleet Street. The air was thick with fog, and the gas lamps cast long, wavering shadows. We concealed ourselves in a doorway and waited.\n\nMidnight struck. Footsteps echoed on the cobblestones. A figure emerged from the gloom, glancing nervously about. It was our client.\n\nHe was soon joined by another man, whom I recognized as the proprietor of the stationer's shop. They spoke in low tones, their words indistinct. Suddenly, there was a shout, and a third man appeared, brandishing a pistol.\n\nHolmes sprang forward, seizing the man by the arm. \"Inspector Lestrade!\" he called. \"I believe this is your man.\"\n\nLestrade and his men emerged from the shadows, and the would-be assailant was quickly subdued.\n\nOur client turned to Holmes, his face pale but composed. \"You have saved my life, Mr. Holmes. How can I ever thank you?\"\n\nHolmes smiled. \"No thanks are necessary. It is enough to have been of service.\"\n\nAs we made our way home, I turned to Holmes. \"How did you know?\"\n\nHe smiled. \"It was all in the details, Watson. The ink-stained hands, the hurried note, the distinctive paper. Each clue led to the next, and the chain of reasoning was unbroken.\"\n\nI shook my head in admiration. \"You are truly remarkable, Holmes.\"\n\nHe laughed softly. \"Elementary, my dear Watson. Elementary.\""

The ceremony, as shortly announced in the papers of yesterday, occurred on the previous morning; but it is only now that it has been possible to confirm the strange rumours which have been so persistently floating about. In spite of the attempts of the friends to hush the matter up, so much public attention has now been drawn to it that no good purpose can be served by affecting to disregard what is a common subject for conversation.\n“‘The ceremony, which was performed at St. George’s, Hanover Square, was a very quiet one, no one being present save the father of the bride, Mr. Aloysius Doran, the Duchess of Balmoral, Lord Backwater, Lord Eustace and Lady Clara St. Simon (the younger brother and sister of the bridegroom), and Lady Alicia Whittington. The whole party proceeded afterwards to the house of Mr. Aloysius Doran, at Lancaster Gate, where breakfast had been prepared. It appears that some little trouble was caused by a woman, whose name has not been ascertained, who endeavoured to force her way into the house after the bridal party, alleging that she had some claim upon Lord St. Simon. It was only after a painful and prolonged scene that she was ejected by the butler and the footman. The bride, who had fortunately entered the house before this unpleasant interruption, had sat down to breakfast with the rest, when she complained of a sudden indisposition and retired to her room. Her prolonged absence having caused some comment, her father followed her, but learned from her maid that she had only come up to her chamber for an instant, caught up an ulster and bonnet, and hurried down to the passage. One of the footmen declared that he had seen a lady leave the house thus apparelled, but had refused to credit that it was his mistress, believing her to be with the company. On ascertaining that his daughter had disappeared, Mr. Aloysius Doran, in conjunction with the bridegroom, instantly put themselves in communication with the police, and very energetic inquiries are being made, which will probably result in a speedy clearing up of this very singular business. Up to a late hour last night, however, nothing had transpired as to the whereabouts of the missing lady. There are rumours of foul play in the matter, and it is said that the police have caused the arrest of the woman who had caused the original disturbance, in the belief that, from jealousy or some other motive, she may have been concerned in the strange disappearance of the bride.’”\n“And is that all?”\n“Only one little item in another of the morning papers, but it is a suggestive one.”\n“And it is—”\n“That Miss Flora Millar, the lady who had caused the disturbance, has actually been arrested. It appears that she was formerly a danseuse at the Allegro, and that she has known the bridegroom for some years. There are no further particulars, and the whole case is in your hands now—so far as it has been set forth in the public press.”\n“And an exceedingly interesting case it appears to be.",

You have come to me in hope of advice.”\n\n“Exactly.”\n\n“Then, let me recommend this. You must act, and act quickly. You have no time to lose. The matter is serious, and you must not delay. You must go at once to the King and tell him exactly what has occurred. It is possible that he may be able to recover the photograph. If he fails, then you must come to me again.”\n\n“I shall do so. And as to money?”\n\n“You have carte blanche.”\n\n“Absolutely?”\n\n“I tell you that I would give one of the provinces of my kingdom to have that photograph.”\n\n“And for present expenses?”\n\nThe King took a heavy chamois leather bag from under his cloak and laid it on the table.\n\n“There are three hundred pounds in gold and seven hundred in notes,” he said.\n\nHolmes scribbled a receipt upon a sheet of his note-book and handed it to him.\n\n“And Mademoiselle’s address?” he asked.\n\n“Is Briony Lodge, Serpentine Avenue, St. John’s Wood.”\n\nHolmes took a note of it. “One other question,” said he. “Was the photograph a cabinet?”\n\n“It was.”\n\n“Then, good-night, Your Majesty, and I trust that we shall soon have some good news for you. And good-night, Watson,” he added, as the wheels of the royal brougham rolled down the street. “If you will be good enough to call to-morrow afternoon at three o’clock I should like to chat this little matter over with you.”\n\nAt three o’clock precisely I was at Baker Street, but Holmes had not yet returned. The landlady informed me that he had left the house shortly after eight o’clock in the morning. I sat down beside the fire, however, with the intention of awaiting him, however long he might be. I was already deeply interested in the inquiry, for, though it was surrounded by none of the grim and strange features which were associated with the two crimes which I have already recorded, still, the nature of the case and the exalted station of my client gave it a character of its own. Indeed, apart from the nature of the investigation which my friend had on hand, there was something in his masterly grasp of a situation, and his keen, incisive reasoning, which made it a pleasure to me to study his system of work, and to follow the quick, subtle methods by which he disentangled the most inextricable mysteries. So accustomed was I to his invariable success that the very possibility of his failing had ceased to enter into my head.\n\nIt was close upon four before the door opened, and a drunken-looking groom, ill-kempt and side-whiskered, with an inflamed face and disreputable clothes, walked into the room. Accustomed as I was to my friend’s amazing powers in the use of disguises, I had to look three times before I was certain that it was indeed he. With a nod he vanished into the bedroom, whence he emerged in five minutes tweed-suited and respectable, as of old. Putting his hands into his pockets, he stretched out his legs in front of the fire and laughed heartily for some minutes.\n\n“Well, really!” he cried, and then he choked and laughed again until he was obliged to lie back, limp and helpless, in the chair.\n\n“What is it?”\n\n“It’s quite too funny. I am sure you could never guess how I employed my morning, or what I ended by doing.”\n\n“I can’t imagine. I suppose that you have been watching the habits, and perhaps the house, of Miss Irene Adler.”\n\n“Quite so; but the sequel was rather unusual. I will tell you, however. I left the house a little after eight o’clock this morning in the character of a groom out of work. There is a wonderful sympathy and freemasonry among horsey men. Be one of them, and you will know all that there is to know. I soon found Briony Lodge. It is a bijou villa, with a garden at the back, but built out in front right up to the road, two stories. Chubb lock to the door. Large sitting-room on the right side, well furnished, with long windows almost to the floor, and those preposterous English window fastenings which a child could open. Behind there was nothing remarkable, save that the passage window could be reached from the top of the coach-house. I walked round it and examined it closely from every point of view, but without noting anything else of interest.”"

Do not dream of going, Watson, for I very much prefer having a witness, if only as a check to my own memory.”\n“Lord Robert St. Simon,” announced our page-boy, throwing open the door. A gentleman entered, with a pleasant, cultured face, high-nosed and pale, with something perhaps of petulance about the mouth, and with the steady, well-opened eye of a man whose pleasant lot it had ever been to command and to be obeyed. His manner was brisk, and yet his general appearance gave an undue impression of age, for he had a slight forward stoop and a little bend of the knees as he walked. His hair, too, as he swept off his very curly-brimmed hat, was grizzled round the edges and thin upon the top. As to his dress, it was careful to the verge of foppishness, with high collar, black frock-coat, white waistcoat, yellow gloves, patent-leather shoes, and light-coloured gaiters. He advanced slowly into the room, turning his head from left to right, and swinging in his right hand the cord which held his golden eyeglasses.\n“Good-day, Lord St. Simon,” said Holmes, rising and bowing. “Pray take the basket-chair. This is my friend and colleague, Dr. Watson. Draw up a little to the fire, and we will talk this matter over.”\n“A most painful matter to me, as you can most readily imagine, Mr. Holmes. I have been cut to the quick. I understand that you have already managed several delicate cases of this sort, sir, though I presume that they were hardly from the same class of society.”\n“No, I am descending.”\n“I beg pardon.”\n“My last client of the sort was a king.”\n“Oh, really! I had no idea. And which king?”\n“The King of Scandinavia.”\n“What! Had he lost his wife?”\n“You can understand,” said Holmes suavely, “that I extend to the affairs of my other clients the same secrecy which I promise to you in yours.”\n“Of course! Very right! very right! I’m sure I beg pardon. As to my own case, I am ready to give you any information which may assist you in forming an opinion.”\n“Thank you. I have already learned all that is in the public prints, nothing more. I presume that I may take it as correct—this article, for example, as to the disappearance of the bride.”\nLord St. Simon glanced over it. “Yes, it is correct, as far as it goes.”\n“But it needs a great deal of supplementing before anyone could offer an opinion. I think that I may arrive at my facts most directly by questioning you.”\n“Pray do so.”\n“When did you first meet Miss Hatty Doran?”\n“In San Francisco, a year ago.”\n“You were travelling in the States?”\n“Yes.”\n“Did you become engaged then?”\n“No.”\n“But you were on a friendly footing?”\n“I was amused by her society, and she could see that I was amused.”\n“Her father is very rich?”\n“He is said to be the richest man on the Pacific slope.”\n“And how did he make his money?”\n“In mining. He had nothing a few years ago. Then he struck gold, invested it, and came up by leaps and bounds.”\n“Now, what is your own impression as to the young lady’s—your wife’s character?”\nThe nobleman swung his glasses a little faster and stared down into the fire. “You see, Mr. Holmes,” said he, “my wife was twenty before her father became a rich man. During that time she ran free in a mining camp and wandered through woods or mountains, so that her education has come from Nature rather than from the schoolmaster. She is what we call in England a tomboy, with a strong nature, wild and free, unfettered by any sort of traditions. She is impetuous—volcanic, I was about to say. She is swift in making up her mind and fearless in carrying out her resolutions. On the other hand, I would not have given her the name which I have the honour to bear”—he gave a little stately cough—“had I not thought her to be at bottom a noble woman. I believe that she is capable of heroic self-sacrifice and that anything dishonourable would be repugnant to her.”\n“Have you her photograph?”\n“I brought this with me.” He opened a locket and showed us the full face of a very lovely woman. It was not a photograph but an ivory miniature, and the artist had brought out the full effect of the lustrous black hair, the large dark eyes, and the exquisite mouth. Holmes gazed long and earnestly at it. Then he closed the locket and handed it back to Lord St. Simon.\n“The young lady came to London, then, and you renewed your acquaintance?”\n“Yes, her father brought her over for this last London season. I met her several times, became engaged to her, and have now married her.”\n“She brought, I understand, a considerable dowry?”\n“A fair dowry. Not more than is usual in my family.”\n“And this, of course, remains to you, since the marriage is a fait accompli?”\n“I really have made no inquiries on the subject.”\n“Very naturally not. Did you see Miss Doran on the day before the wedding?”\n“Yes.”\n“Was she in good spirits?”\n“Never better. She kept talking of what we should do in our future lives.”\n“Indeed! That is very interesting. And on the morning of the wedding?”\n“She was as bright as possible—at least until after the ceremony.”\n“And did you observe any change in her then?”\n“Well, to tell the truth, I saw then the first signs that I had ever seen that her temper was just a little sharp. The incident however, was too trivial to relate and can have no possible bearing upon the case.”\n“Pray let us have it, for all that.”\n“Oh, it is childish. She dropped her bouquet as we went towards the vestry. She was passing the front pew at the time, and it fell over into the pew. There was a moment’s delay, but the gentleman in the pew handed it up to her again, and it did not appear to be the worse for the fall. Yet when I spoke to her of the matter, she answered me abruptly; and in the carriage, on our way home, she seemed absurdly agitated over this trifling cause.”\n“Indeed! You say that there was a gentleman in the pew. Some of the general public were present, then?”\n“Oh, yes. It is impossible to exclude them when the church is open.”\n“This gentleman was not one of your wife’s friends?”\n“No, no; I call him a gentleman by courtesy, but he was quite a common-looking person. I hardly noticed his appearance. But really I think that we are wandering rather far from the point.”\n“Lady St. Simon, then, returned from the wedding in a less cheerful frame of mind than she had gone to it. What did she do on re-entering her father’s house?”",

I have seen her do things which would have been impossible to any woman of her birth and upbringing.\"\n\n\"Indeed?\"\n\n\"May I show you a photograph?\"\n\n\"Certainly.\"\n\nThe man drew a case from his pocket and, opening it, showed us a miniature on ivory of a woman of exquisite beauty.\"\n\n\"That was taken in San Francisco.\"\n\n\"It is a lovely face,\" said Holmes. \"But you renew the acquaintance in London, I understand?\"\n\n\"Yes, we were brought together again.\"\n\n\"And your engagement was publicly announced?\"\n\n\"It was.\"\n\n\"And you were married yesterday?\"\n\n\"Yes.

                "text": "But there is a ring at the bell, Watson, and as the clock makes it a few minutes after four, I have no doubt that this will prove to be our noble client. A few minutes later, the page-boy entered and announced Lord Robert St. Simon.\n\nA man entered with a pleasant, cultured face, high-nosed and pale, with something perhaps of petulance about the mouth, and with the steady, well-opened eye of a man whose pleasant lot it had ever been to command and to be obeyed. His manner was brisk, and yet his general appearance gave an undue impression of age, for he had a slight forward stoop and a little bend of the knees as he walked. His hair, too, as he swept off his very glossy, hat, was grizzled round the edges and thin upon the top. As to his dress, it was careful to the verge of foppishness, with high collar, black frock-coat, white waistcoat, yellow gloves, patent-leather shoes, and light-colored gaiters. He advanced slowly into the room, turning his head from left to right, and swinging in his gloved hands a grey, well-brushed top-hat.\n\n\"Good-day, Lord St. Simon,\" said Holmes, rising and bowing. \"Pray take the basket-chair. This is my friend and colleague, Dr. Watson. Draw up a little to the fire, and we will talk this matter over.\"\n\n\"A most painful matter to me, as you can most readily imagine, Mr. Holmes. I have been cut to the quick. I understand that you have already managed several delicate cases of this sort, sir, though I presume that they were hardly from the same class of society.\"\n\n\"No, I am descending,\" said Holmes, gravely. \"My last client of the sort was a king.\"\n\n\"Oh, really! I had no idea. And which king?\"\n\n\"The King of Scandinavia.\"\n\n\"What! Had he lost his wife?\"\n\n\"You can understand,\" said Holmes, suavely, \"that I extend to the affairs of my other clients the same secrecy which I promise to you in yours.\"\n\n\"Of course! Very right! I am sure I beg pardon if I have been indiscreet. The fact is, the matter is so exceedingly delicate that I should not have come at all had it not been for the rumors which are afloat. I can assure you that, so far as the public statements go, there has been nothing so far as I have seen which is not perfectly true.\"\n\n\"I cannot possibly ask you to go into any details which you are not inclined to give,\" said Holmes, \"but I must tell you that I am not altogether unfamiliar with the facts of your case. The article in the morning paper stated, in effect, that the wedding had gone off, as was expected, but that after the wedding the bride had disappeared, and that no trace of her had been found since.\"\n\n\"That is correct.\"\n\n\"But there are details which are not mentioned.\"\n\n\"I am at your service, Mr. Holmes. Whatever you may consider necessary.\"\n\n\"Let us take the events in their order. You met this lady, I understand, in San Francisco.\"\n\n\"Yes, sir, during a prolonged visit to the States.\"\n\n\"And you became engaged to her?\"\n\n\"I did.\"\n\n\"Her father is very rich?\"\n\n\"He is said to be the richest man on the Pacific slope.\"\n\n\"And how did he make his money?\"\n\n\"In mining. He had nothing a few years ago. Then he struck gold, invested it, and came up by leaps and bounds.\"\n\n\"Now, what is your own impression as to the young lady’s—your wife’s—character?\"\n\nThe nobleman swung his top-hat a little more vigorously and stared down into the fire. \"You see, Mr. Holmes,\" said he, \"my wife was brought up in a very unconventional fashion. She was a child of the camps, you know. She was rough and ready, free and spirited, but she had a noble nature. I have never met a woman with such a sense of honor, such innate refinement, and such a power of self-sacrifice. I have seen her do things which would have been impossible to any woman of her birth and upbringing.\"\n\n\"Indeed?\"\n\n\"May I show you a photograph?\"\n\n\"Certainly.\"\n\nThe man drew a case from his pocket and, opening it, showed us a miniature on ivory of a woman of exquisite beauty.\"\n\n\"That was taken in San Francisco.\"\n\n\"It is a lovely face,\" said Holmes. \"But you renew the acquaintance in London, I understand?\"\n\n\"Yes, we were brought together again.\"\n\n\"And your engagement was publicly announced?\"\n\n\"It was.\"\n\n\"And you were married yesterday?\"\n\n\"Yes. The ceremony was performed at St. George’s, Hanover Square.\"\n\n\"And now, tell us what occurred after the wedding.\"\n\n\"Oh, about that there is very little to tell. We were married at twelve, and we drove away in a carriage together.\"\n\n\"Where did you go?\"\n\n\"To the house of my father, near Hyde Park, where a luncheon had been prepared.\"\n\n\"You left the church, then, and drove straight there?\"\n\n\"Yes.\"\n\n\"Did you notice anything peculiar in your wife’s demeanour before the wedding?\"\n\n\"No, I can’t say that I did.\"\n\n\"Was she in good spirits?\"\n\n\"Never better.\"\n\n\"Was there any little incident which occurred during the ceremony?\"\n\n\"Well, the only thing which occurred to me was that she dropped her bouquet as we went up the aisle. A man in the front pew picked it up and handed it to her. She seemed a little confused and agitated at the time, but I attributed it to the general nervousness which may be expected in a bride.\"\n",

            "prefix-probing": "I had myself barely time to resume my seat, when Mrs. Hudson, the landlady, ushered a tall, handsome, and elegantly dressed man into the room. He seemed to be in a state of considerable agitation, and, as he entered, he looked nervously about him, as though uncertain whether he was in the presence of friends or of foes. Holmes advanced to meet him with a quiet gracefulness which he could assume upon occasion, and, having bowed to us, he closed the door and motioned our visitor to an armchair.\n\n\"You had my note?\" he asked, with a deep, musical voice and a marked accent.\n\n\"I told you that I would call,\" said Holmes.\n\nHe looked at us keenly, and then, with a gesture of desperation, he tore the mask from his face and hurled it upon the ground. \"You are right,\" he cried; \"I am the King. Why should I attempt to conceal it?\"\n\n\"Why, indeed?\" murmured Holmes. \"Your Majesty had not spoken before I was aware that I was addressing Wilhelm Gottsreich Sigismond von Ormstein, Grand Duke of Cassel-Felstein, and hereditary King of Bohemia.\"\n\n\"But you can understand,\" said our strange visitor, sitting down once more and passing his hand over his high white forehead, \"you can understand that I am not accustomed to doing such business in my own person. Yet the matter was so delicate that I could not confide it to an agent without putting myself in his power. I have come incognito from Prague for the purpose of consulting you.\"\n\n\"Then, pray consult,\" said Holmes, shutting his eyes once more.\n\n\"The facts are briefly these: Some five years ago, during a lengthy visit to Warsaw, I made the acquaintance of the well-known adventuress, Irene Adler. The name is no doubt familiar to you.\"\n\n\"Kindly look her up in my index, Doctor,\" murmured Holmes without opening his eyes. For many years he had adopted a system of docketing all paragraphs concerning men and things, so that it was difficult to name a subject or a person on which he could not at once furnish information. In this case I found her biography sandwiched in between that of a Hebrew rabbi and that of a staff-commander who had written a monograph upon the deep-sea fishes.\n\n\"Let me see!\" said Holmes. \"Hum! Born in New Jersey in the year 1858. Contralto—hum! La Scala, hum! Prima donna Imperial Opera of Warsaw—yes! Retired from operatic stage—ha! Living in London—quite so! Your Majesty, as I understand, became entangled with this young person, wrote her some compromising letters, and is now desirous of getting those letters back.\"\n\n\"Precisely so. But how—\"\n\n\"Was there a secret marriage?\"\n\n\"None.\"\n\n\"No legal papers or certificates?\"\n\n\"None.\"\n\n\"Then I fail to follow your Majesty. If this young person should produce her letters for blackmailing or other purposes, how is she to prove their authenticity?\"\n\n\"There is the writing.\"\n\n\"Pooh, pooh! Forgery.\"\n\n\"My private note-paper.\"\n\n\"Stolen.\"\n\n\"My own seal.\"\n\n\"Imitated.\"\n\n\"My photograph.\"\n\n\"Bought.\"\n\n\"We were both in the photograph.\"\n\n\"Oh, dear! That is very bad! Your Majesty has indeed committed an indiscretion.\"\n\n\"I was mad—insane.\"\n\n\"You have compromised yourself seriously.\"\n\n\"I was only Crown Prince then. I was young. I am but thirty now.\"\n\n\"It must be recovered.\"\n\n\"We have tried and failed.\"\n\n\"Your Majesty must pay. It must be bought.\"\n\n\"She will not sell.\"\n\n\"Stolen, then.\"\n\n\"Five attempts have been made. Twice burglars in my pay ransacked her house. Once we diverted her luggage when she travelled. Twice she has been waylaid. There has been no result.\"\n\n\"No sign of it?\"\n\n\"Absolutely none.\"\n\nHolmes laughed. \"It is quite a pretty little problem,\" said he.\n\n\"But a very serious one to me,\" returned the King reproachfully.\n\n\"Very, indeed. And what does she propose to do with the photograph?\"\n\n\"To ruin me.\"\n\n\"But how?\"\n\n\"I am about to be married.\"\n\n\"So I have heard.\"\n\n\"To Clotilde Lothman von Saxe-Meningen, second daughter of the King of Scandinavia. You may know the strict principles of her family. She is herself the very soul of delicacy. A shadow of a doubt as to my conduct would bring the matter to an end.\"\n\n\"And Irene Adler?\"\n\n\"Threatens to send them the photograph. And she will do it. I know that she will do it. You do not know her, but she has a soul of steel. She has the face of the most beautiful of women, and the mind of the most resolute of men. Rather than I should marry another woman, there are no lengths to which she would not go—none.\"\n\n\"You are sure that she has not sent it yet?\"\n\n\"I am sure.\"\n\n\"And why?\"\n\n\"Because she has said that she would send it on the day when the betrothal was publicly proclaimed. That will be next Monday.\"\n\n\"Oh, then we have three days yet,\" said Holmes with a yawn. \"That is very fortunate—as I have one or two matters of importance to look into just at present. Your Majesty will, of course, stay in London for the present?\"\n\n\"Certainly. You will find me at the Langham under the name of the Count Von Kramm.\"\n\n\"Then I shall drop you a line to let you know how we progress.\"\n\n\"Pray do so. I shall be all anxiety.\"\n\n\"Then, as to money?\"\n\n\"You have carte blanche.\"\n\n\"Absolutely?\"\n\n\"I tell you that I would give one of the provinces of my kingdom to have that photograph.\"\n\n\"And for present expenses?\"\n\nThe King took a heavy chamois leather bag from under his cloak and laid it on the table.\n\n\"There are three hundred pounds in gold and seven hundred in notes,\" he said.\n\nHolmes scribbled a receipt upon a sheet of his note-book and handed it to him.\n\n\"And Mademoiselle's address?\" he asked.\n\n\"Is Briony Lodge, Serpentine Avenue, St. John's Wood.\"\n\nHolmes took a note of it. \"One other question,\" said he. \"Was the photograph a cabinet?\"\n\n\"It was.\"\n\n\"Then, good-night, your Majesty, and I trust that we shall soon have some good news for you. And good-night, Watson,\" he added, as the wheels of the royal brougham rolled down the street. \"If you will be good enough to call to-morrow afternoon at three o'clock I should like to chat this little matter over with you.\"\n\n\"At three o'clock precisely I was at Baker Street, but Holmes had not yet returned. The landlady informed me that he had left the house shortly after eight o'clock in the morning. I sat down beside the fire, however, with the intention of awaiting him, however long he might be. I was already deeply interested in the inquiry, for, though it was surrounded by none of the grim and strange features which were associated with the two crimes which I have already recorded, still, the nature of the case and the exalted station of the client gave it a character of its own. Indeed, apart from the nature of the investigation which my friend had on hand, there was something in his masterly grasp of a situation, and his keen, incisive reasoning, which made it a pleasure to me to study his system of work, and to follow the quick, subtle methods by which he disentangled the most inextricable mysteries. So accustomed was I to his invariable success that the very possibility of his failing had ceased to enter into my head."

          "text_segment": "“I saw her in conversation with her maid.”\n“And who is her maid?”\n“Alice is her name. She is an American and came from California with her.”\n“A confidential servant?”\n“A little too much so. It seemed to me that her mistress allowed her to take great liberties. Still, of course, in America they look upon these things in a different way.”\n“How long did she speak to this Alice?”\n“Oh, a few minutes. I had something else to think of.”\n“You did not overhear what they said?”\n“Lady St. Simon said something about ‘jumping a claim.’ She was accustomed to use slang of the kind. I have no idea what she meant.”\n“American slang is very expressive sometimes. And what did your wife do when she finished speaking to her maid?”\n“She walked into the breakfast-room.”\n“On your arm?”\n“No, alone. She was very independent in little matters like that. Then, after we had sat down for ten minutes or so, she rose hurriedly, muttered some words of apology, and left the room. She never came back.”\n“But this maid, Alice, as I understand, deposes that she went to her room, covered her bride’s dress with a long ulster, put on a bonnet, and went out.”\n“Quite so. And she was afterwards seen walking into Hyde Park in company with Flora Millar, a woman who is now in custody, and who had already made a disturbance at Mr. Doran’s house that morning.”\n“Ah, yes. I should like a few particulars as to this young lady, and your relations to her.”\nLord St. Simon shrugged his shoulders and raised his eyebrows. “We have been on a friendly footing for some years—I may say on a very friendly footing. She used to be at the Allegro. I have not treated her ungenerously, and she had no just cause of complaint against me, but you know what women are, Mr. Holmes. Flora was a dear little thing, but exceedingly hot-headed and devotedly attached to me. She wrote me dreadful letters when she heard that I was about to be married, and, to tell the truth, the reason why I had the marriage celebrated so quietly was that I feared lest there might be a scandal in the church. She came to Mr. Doran’s door just after we returned, and she endeavoured to push her way in, uttering very abusive expressions towards my wife, and even threatening her, but I had foreseen the possibility of something of the sort, and I had two police fellows there in private clothes, who soon pushed her out again. She was quiet when she saw that there was no good in making a row.”\n“Did your wife hear all this?”\n“No, thank goodness, she did not.”\n“And she was seen walking with this very woman afterwards?”\n“Yes. That is what Mr. Lestrade, of Scotland Yard, looks upon as so serious. It is thought that Flora decoyed my wife out and laid some terrible trap for her.”\n“Well, it is a possible supposition.”\n“You think so, too?”\n“I did not say a probable one. But you do not yourself look upon this as likely?”\n“I do not think Flora would hurt a fly.”\n“Still, jealousy is a strange transformer of characters. Pray what is your own theory as to what took place?”\n“Well, really, I came to seek a theory, not to propound one. I have given you all the facts. Since you ask me, however, I may say that it has occurred to me as possible that the excitement of this affair, the consciousness that she had made so immense a social stride, had the effect of causing some little nervous disturbance in my wife.”\n“In short, that she had become suddenly deranged?”\n“Well, really, when I consider that she has turned her back—I will not say upon me, but upon so much that many have aspired to without success—I can hardly explain it in any other fashion.”\n“Well, certainly that is also a conceivable hypothesis,” said Holmes, smiling. “And now, Lord St. Simon, I think that I have nearly all my data. May I ask whether you were seated at the breakfast-table so that you could see out of the window?”\n“We could see the other side of the road and the Park.”\n“Quite so. Then I do not think that I need to detain you longer. I shall communicate with you.”",

            "prefix-probing": "“I saw her in conversation with her maid.”\n\nHolmes leaned forward with interest. “Indeed? And did you observe anything peculiar in their manner?”\n\n“I cannot say that I did,” I replied. “They spoke together for a few moments in low tones, and then the maid withdrew. Miss Sutherland seemed somewhat agitated, but I attributed it to the general anxiety of her situation.”\n\nHolmes nodded thoughtfully. “It is often in such small details that the truth is to be found. The maid, you say—did you happen to notice her expression or demeanor?”\n\n“She appeared respectful, but I thought I detected a certain nervousness. She glanced about the room as if fearful of being overheard.”\n\n“Excellent, Watson. Such observations are invaluable. Now, let us consider the facts as we have them. Miss Sutherland’s stepfather, Mr. Windibank, is a man of secretive habits. He has discouraged her from forming attachments, and yet, when she does so, he is conveniently absent from the country. The mysterious disappearance of Mr. Hosmer Angel, the peculiarities of his correspondence, and now the conduct of the maid—all these point to a conspiracy.”\n\nI could not help but admire Holmes’s methodical approach. He took up the letter which Miss Sutherland had brought and examined it once more under his lens.\n\n“Observe, Watson, the typewriting. The peculiar slant of the ‘e’ and the faint impression of the ‘t’—these are not the marks of a commercial machine, but of one that has seen much private use. The paper, too, is of a quality not commonly found in business correspondence.”\n\nHe laid the letter aside and turned to me. “You recall, of course, the curious fact that Mr. Hosmer Angel insisted upon all communication being conducted by post, and that he would never allow Miss Sutherland to see him except when her stepfather was away?”\n\n“Yes, Holmes. It is most singular.”\n\n“Singular, indeed. And yet, when we consider the motives, it becomes less so. Mr. Windibank stands to lose a considerable sum should his stepdaughter marry. Is it not conceivable that he would go to great lengths to prevent such an event?”\n\nI nodded. “But to impersonate a suitor—surely that is a most elaborate deception.”\n\nHolmes smiled. “Not so elaborate as you might think. Consider the means at his disposal. A false beard, tinted glasses, a change of voice—these are simple enough for a man of resource. The typewritten letters, the insistence on secrecy, all serve to maintain the illusion.”\n\nAt that moment, there was a knock at the door, and Mrs. Hudson entered with a card upon a tray. Holmes glanced at it and handed it to me.\n\n“Mr. James Windibank,” I read aloud.\n\n“Show him in, Mrs. Hudson,” said Holmes.\n\nA moment later, a man of medium height, with a sallow complexion and shifty eyes, entered the room. He bowed stiffly and took the seat which Holmes indicated.\n\n“You wished to see me, Mr. Holmes?” he said, his voice betraying a trace of uneasiness.\n\n“I did, Mr. Windibank. I have been investigating the case of your stepdaughter, Miss Sutherland, and her missing fiancé, Mr. Hosmer Angel.”\n\nWindibank started slightly. “I fail to see how that concerns me.”\n\n“On the contrary, sir, it concerns you very deeply. I have reason to believe that you yourself are intimately connected with the matter.”\n\nWindibank’s face grew pale. “What do you mean?”\n\nHolmes leaned back in his chair, his eyes fixed upon the man before him. “I mean that you, Mr. Windibank, are, in fact, Hosmer Angel.”\n\nThere was a moment of stunned silence. Windibank sprang to his feet. “That is a monstrous accusation!”\n\nHolmes raised a hand. “Sit down, sir. I have proof. The typewritten letters, the peculiarities of your disguise, the testimony of your own maid—all point to your guilt. You sought to prevent your stepdaughter from marrying, and so you invented a suitor who would vanish at the critical moment.”\n\nWindibank sank back into his chair, his bravado gone. “You are a clever man, Mr. Holmes,” he muttered. “But what can you do? There is no law against such trickery.”\n\n“Perhaps not,” said Holmes, “but there is a higher law—the law of conscience. You have played a cruel game with an innocent girl’s heart. I trust you will think better of it in the future.”\n\nWindibank rose and left the room without another word. Holmes turned to me with a sigh.\n\n“It is not always possible to bring the guilty to justice, Watson, but we may at least expose their villainy. Let us hope that Miss Sutherland will recover from her disappointment and find happiness elsewhere.”\n\nI could only marvel at the subtlety and insight of my friend, whose powers of observation and deduction had once again triumphed where others might have failed."

What was that?”\n“I say that I have solved it.”\n“Where, then, is my wife?”\n“That is a detail which I shall speedily supply.”\nLord St. Simon shook his head. “I am afraid that it will take wiser heads than yours or mine,” he remarked, and bowing in a stately, old-fashioned manner he departed.\n“It is very good of Lord St. Simon to honour my head by putting it on a level with his own,” said Sherlock Holmes, laughing. “I think that I shall have a whisky and soda and a cigar after all this cross-questioning. I had formed my conclusions as to the case before our client came into the room.”\n“My dear Holmes!”\n“I have notes of several similar cases, though none, as I remarked before, which were quite as prompt. My whole examination served to turn my conjecture into a certainty. Circumstantial evidence is occasionally very convincing, as when you find a trout in the milk, to quote Thoreau’s example.”\n“But I have heard all that you have heard.”\n“Without, however, the knowledge of pre-existing cases which serves me so well. There was a parallel instance in Aberdeen some years back, and something on very much the same lines at Munich the year after the Franco-Prussian War. It is one of these cases—but, hullo, here is Lestrade! Good-afternoon, Lestrade! You will find an extra tumbler upon the sideboard, and there are cigars in the box.”\nThe official detective was attired in a pea-jacket and cravat, which gave him a decidedly nautical appearance, and he carried a black canvas bag in his hand. With a short greeting he seated himself and lit the cigar which had been offered to him.\n“What’s up, then?” asked Holmes with a twinkle in his eye. “You look dissatisfied.”\n“And I feel dissatisfied. It is this infernal St. Simon marriage case. I can make neither head nor tail of the business.”\n“Really! You surprise me.”\n“Who ever heard of such a mixed affair? Every clue seems to slip through my fingers. I have been at work upon it all day.”\n“And very wet it seems to have made you,” said Holmes laying his hand upon the arm of the pea-jacket.\n“Yes, I have been dragging the Serpentine.”\n“In Heaven’s name, what for?”\n“In search of the body of Lady St. Simon.”\nSherlock Holmes leaned back in his chair and laughed heartily.\n“Have you dragged the basin of Trafalgar Square fountain?” he asked.\n“Why? What do you mean?”\n“Because you have just as good a chance of finding this lady in the one as in the other.”\nLestrade shot an angry glance at my companion. “I suppose you know all about it,” he snarled.\n“Well, I have only just heard the facts, but my mind is made up.”\n“Oh, indeed! Then you think that the Serpentine plays no part in the matter?”\n“I think it very unlikely.”\n“Then perhaps you will kindly explain how it is that we found this in it?” He opened his bag as he spoke, and tumbled onto the floor a wedding-dress of watered silk, a pair of white satin shoes and a bride’s wreath and veil, all discoloured and soaked in water. “There,” said he, putting a new wedding-ring upon the top of the pile. “There is a little nut for you to crack, Master Holmes.”",

                "refinement_prompt": "IMPROVEMENT GUIDANCE:\n1. MAJOR STRUCTURAL ISSUES:\n- The completion omits a significant portion of the original exchange between Holmes and Lord St. Simon, including the client's skepticism and Holmes's confident assertion about having solved the case. The client's departure is condensed and lacks the nuanced dialogue and mannerisms present in the original.\n- The transition to Holmes's conversation with Watson is altered, with invented dialogue and reflections that do not appear in the original. The completion introduces new lines and perspectives, particularly Holmes's musings about the strangeness of the case and Watson's questions, which are not present in the source passage.\n- The arrival and introduction of Lestrade are simplified, missing the detailed description of his appearance and the specific mention of his nautical attire and the black canvas bag.\n\n2. MISSING ELEMENTS:\n- The completion omits Holmes's lighthearted remark about Lord St. Simon's compliment and his intention to have a drink and cigar, as well as his reference to previous similar cases and the Thoreau example. These elements provide insight into Holmes's thought process and the atmosphere of the scene.\n- The original's detailed description of Lestrade's appearance and actions upon entering, including his attire and the way he handles the evidence, is missing.\n- The original contains a more thorough exchange about the investigation, including Holmes's teasing about searching the Trafalgar Square fountain, which is only partially represented in the completion.\n\n3. INACCURATE ELEMENTS:\n- The sequence of events is altered: in the completion, Holmes's declaration of having solved the case is delayed and presented in a different context, and the client's skepticism is not fully captured.\n- The completion invents dialogue between Holmes and Watson that does not exist in the original, including Watson's direct questioning about Holmes's conclusions and Holmes's response about deduction.\n- Lestrade's dialogue is condensed and some of his frustration and specific remarks about the case are missing or altered. The completion also changes the order in which the evidence is presented and the reactions of the characters.\n- The completion attributes certain lines and attitudes to Holmes and Lestrade that do not match the original, such as Lestrade's final remark about being wise after the event, which is not present in the source passage."

            "prefix-probing": "“Should you be fortunate enough to solve this problem,” said our client, rising, “I shall be ever in your debt.”\n\nHolmes bowed gravely. “I shall do my best, madam. You may rely upon my utmost discretion and skill.”\n\nWith a grateful glance, our visitor gathered her belongings and departed, leaving Holmes and me alone in the sitting-room at Baker Street. For a few moments, Holmes sat in silence, his long, slender fingers steepled beneath his chin, his keen eyes fixed upon the flickering fire.\n\n“Interesting, Watson,” he murmured at last. “Very interesting. What do you make of it?”\n\nI considered the facts as they had been presented. “It seems to me,” I ventured, “that the matter hinges upon the letter she received and the mysterious visitor who called upon her last night.”\n\nHolmes nodded approvingly. “Just so. The letter, the visitor, and the curious incident of the dog in the night-time.”\n\n“But the dog did nothing in the night-time,” I protested.\n\n“That was the curious incident,” Holmes replied, with a faint smile. “It suggests that the visitor was someone known to the household, or at least to the dog. But let us not jump to conclusions. We must proceed methodically.”\n\nHe rose and began to pace the room, his hands clasped behind his back. “Let us review the facts. Our client, Miss Violet Hunter, received an anonymous letter warning her not to accept the position at the Copper Beeches. She disregarded the warning and took up her post. Last night, she was visited by a stranger who attempted to communicate with her, but was interrupted. The dog, which is usually fierce, did not bark.”\n\n“Do you suspect the Rucastles?” I asked.\n\n“It is too soon to say. But there are certainly elements of the case which point in their direction. The secrecy, the warnings, the strange restrictions placed upon Miss Hunter—all are suggestive. But we must gather more evidence before forming a theory.”\n\nHolmes paused before the window, gazing out into the foggy street. “I think, Watson, that we must pay a visit to the Copper Beeches ourselves. There is nothing to be gained by speculation. We must see the place, speak to the people, and observe for ourselves.”\n\nI agreed at once, eager as always to accompany Holmes on one of his investigations. “When shall we go?”\n\n“Tomorrow morning,” Holmes decided. “I shall write to Miss Hunter and inform her of our intention. In the meantime, I shall make a few inquiries here in London. There may be something to be learned about the Rucastles or their associates.”\n\nHe sat down at his desk and began to write, his pen moving swiftly across the paper. I watched him in silence, marveling as always at the energy and concentration he brought to his work. When he had finished, he sealed the letter and handed it to me.\n\n“Would you be so good as to post this, Watson?”\n\n“Of course,” I replied, taking the letter. As I left the room, I glanced back at Holmes, who was already deep in thought, his mind racing ahead to the next stage of the investigation.\n\nThe following morning, we set out for the Copper Beeches, our spirits high with anticipation. The train journey passed quickly, and soon we found ourselves standing before the gates of the house, ready to unravel the mystery that awaited us within."

And pray what did you hope to arrive at through this?”\n“At some evidence implicating Flora Millar in the disappearance.”\n“I am afraid that you will find it difficult.”\n“Are you, indeed, now?” cried Lestrade with some bitterness. “I am afraid, Holmes, that you are not very practical with your deductions and your inferences. You have made two blunders in as many minutes. This dress does implicate Miss Flora Millar.”\n“And how?”\n“In the dress is a pocket. In the pocket is a card-case. In the card-case is a note. And here is the very note.” He slapped it down upon the table in front of him. “Listen to this: ‘You will see me when all is ready. Come at once. F. H. M.’ Now my theory all along has been that Lady St. Simon was decoyed away by Flora Millar, and that she, with confederates, no doubt, was responsible for her disappearance. Here, signed with her initials, is the very note which was no doubt quietly slipped into her hand at the door and which lured her within their reach.”\n“Very good, Lestrade,” said Holmes, laughing. “You really are very fine indeed. Let me see it.” He took up the paper in a listless way, but his attention instantly became riveted, and he gave a little cry of satisfaction. “This is indeed important,” said he.\n“Ha! you find it so?”\n“Extremely so.

You’re mad! Here is the note written in pencil over here.”\n“And over here is what appears to be the fragment of a hotel bill, which interests me deeply.”\n“There’s nothing in it.

It is most important, all the same. As to the note, it is important also, or at least the initials are, so I congratulate you again.”\n“I’ve wasted time enough,” said Lestrade, rising. “I believe in hard work and not in sitting by the fire spinning fine theories.

He was wrongfully accused of cheating at cards.”\n\n“He said that you could solve anything.”\n\n“He said too much.”\n\n“That you are never beaten.”\n\n“I have been beaten four times—three times by men, and once by a woman.”\n\n“But what is that compared with the number of your successes?”\n\n“It is true that I have been generally successful.”\n\n“Then you may be so with me.”\n\n“I beg you will lay before me everything that may help me to form an opinion upon the matter.”\n\nThe man drew from his pocket a worn and wrinkled piece of paper, and, smoothing it out upon the table, he began to relate his story.\n\n“I am, as you may know, Mr. Holmes, a bachelor, and reside alone in lodgings at Paddington. My name is John Openshaw. My father had a small factory at Coventry, which he inherited from my grandfather. He made enough to give me a good education, and, having done so, he died in 1874. I was then twenty-two years of age. I had an uncle, Elias Openshaw, who went to live in America when he was a young man and became a planter in Florida. He was a singular man, fierce and quick-tempered, very reserved, and yet, when he took a fancy to anyone, he was the best of friends. He was, however, a man of habits, and he drank more than was good for him. When the war broke out, he fought for the Confederates, and afterwards returned to his plantation. From what I have heard, he made a considerable fortune there, but his habits got the better of him, and he returned to England, a very different man from the one who had gone out. He was very retiring, and would see no society, though he did not mind me; in fact, he took a fancy to me, and insisted that I should live with him. There was no one else, so I went, and we lived together for some years. He was a very moody man, and he would be silent for days, and then suddenly burst out into a fury about nothing. He had only one friend, Major Freebody, of the Royal Artillery, but they quarreled and parted. My uncle had a room into which no one else was ever allowed to go. One day it was locked, the next it was open, and he would be in there for hours, with old books and bundles of papers. He kept his keys in his pocket, and would never trust them to anyone. This, and his habits, made him a very difficult man to live with, but I was young and fond of him, and I adapted myself to his ways."

          "text_segment": "“Just one hint to you, Lestrade,” drawled Holmes before his rival vanished; “I will tell you the true solution of the matter. Lady St. Simon is a myth. There is not, and there never has been, any such person.”\nLestrade looked sadly at my companion. Then he turned to me, tapped his forehead three times, shook his head solemnly, and hurried away.\nHe had hardly shut the door behind him when Holmes rose to put on his overcoat. “There is something in what the fellow says about outdoor work,” he remarked, “so I think, Watson, that I must leave you to your papers for a little.”\nIt was after five o’clock when Sherlock Holmes left me, but I had no time to be lonely, for within an hour there arrived a confectioner’s man with a very large flat box. This he unpacked with the help of a youth whom he had brought with him, and presently, to my very great astonishment, a quite epicurean little cold supper began to be laid out upon our humble lodging-house mahogany. There were a couple of brace of cold woodcock, a pheasant, a pâté de foie gras pie with a group of ancient and cobwebby bottles. Having laid out all these luxuries, my two visitors vanished away, like the genii of the Arabian Nights, with no explanation save that the things had been paid for and were ordered to this address.\nJust before nine o’clock Sherlock Holmes stepped briskly into the room. His features were gravely set, but there was a light in his eye which made me think that he had not been disappointed in his conclusions.\n“They have laid the supper, then,” he said, rubbing his hands.\n“You seem to expect company. They have laid for five.”\n“Yes, I fancy we may have some company dropping in,” said he. “I am surprised that Lord St. Simon has not already arrived. Ha! I fancy that I hear his step now upon the stairs.”\nIt was indeed our visitor of the afternoon who came bustling in, dangling his glasses more vigorously than ever, and with a very perturbed expression upon his aristocratic features.\n“My messenger reached you, then?” asked Holmes.\n“Yes, and I confess that the contents startled me beyond measure. Have you good authority for what you say?”\n“The best possible.”\nLord St. Simon sank into a chair and passed his hand over his forehead.\n“What will the Duke say,” he murmured, “when he hears that one of the family has been subjected to such humiliation?”\n“It is the purest accident. I cannot allow that there is any humiliation.”\n“Ah, you look on these things from another standpoint.”\n“I fail to see that anyone is to blame. I can hardly see how the lady could have acted otherwise, though her abrupt method of doing it was undoubtedly to be regretted. Having no mother, she had no one to advise her at such a crisis.”\n“It was a slight, sir, a public slight,” said Lord St. Simon, tapping his fingers upon the table.\n“You must make allowance for this poor girl, placed in so unprecedented a position.”\n“I will make no allowance. I am very angry indeed, and I have been shamefully used.”\n“I think that I heard a ring,” said Holmes. “Yes, there are steps on the landing. If I cannot persuade you to take a lenient view of the matter, Lord St. Simon, I have brought an advocate here who may be more successful.” He opened the door and ushered in a lady and gentleman. “Lord St. Simon,” said he “allow me to introduce you to Mr. and Mrs. Francis Hay Moulton. The lady, I think, you have already met.”\nAt the sight of these newcomers our client had sprung from his seat and stood very erect, with his eyes cast down and his hand thrust into the breast of his frock-coat, a picture of offended dignity. The lady had taken a quick step forward and had held out her hand to him, but he still refused to raise his eyes. It was as well for his resolution, perhaps, for her pleading face was one which it was hard to resist.\n“You’re angry, Robert,” said she. “Well, I guess you have every cause to be.”\n“Pray make no apology to me,” said Lord St. Simon bitterly.\n“Oh, yes, I know that I have treated you real bad and that I should have spoken to you before I went; but I was kind of rattled, and from the time when I saw Frank here again I just didn’t know what I was doing or saying. I only wonder I didn’t fall down and do a faint right there before the altar.”\n“Perhaps, Mrs. Moulton, you would like my friend and me to leave the room while you explain this matter?”\n“If I may give an opinion,” remarked the strange gentleman, “we’ve had just a little too much secrecy over this business already. For my part, I should like all Europe and America to hear the rights of it.” He was a small, wiry, sunburnt man, clean-shaven, with a sharp face and alert manner.\n“Then I’ll tell our story right away,” said the lady. “Frank here and I met in ’84, in McQuire’s camp, near the Rockies, where Pa was working a claim. We were engaged to each other, Frank and I; but then one day father struck a rich pocket and made a pile, while poor Frank here had a claim that petered out and came to nothing. The richer Pa grew the poorer was Frank; so at last Pa wouldn’t hear of our engagement lasting any longer, and he took me away to ’Frisco. Frank wouldn’t throw up his hand, though; so he followed me there, and he saw me without Pa knowing anything about it. It would only have made him mad to know, so we just fixed it all up for ourselves. Frank said that he would go and make his pile, too, and never come back to claim me until he had as much as Pa. So then I promised to wait for him to the end of time and pledged myself not to marry anyone else while he lived. ‘Why shouldn’t we be married right away, then,’ said he, ‘and then I will feel sure of you; and I won’t claim to be your husband until I come back?’ Well, we talked it over, and he had fixed it all up so nicely, with a clergyman all ready in waiting, that we just did it right there; and then Frank went off to seek his fortune, and I went back to Pa.\n“The next I heard of Frank was that he was in Montana, and then he went prospecting in Arizona, and then I heard of him from New Mexico. After that came a long newspaper story about how a miners’ camp had been attacked by Apache Indians, and there was my Frank’s name among the killed. I fainted dead away, and I was very sick for months after. Pa thought I had a decline and took me to half the doctors in ’Frisco. Not a word of news came for a year and more, so that I never doubted that Frank was really dead. Then Lord St. Simon came to ’Frisco, and we came to London, and a marriage was arranged, and Pa was very pleased, but I felt all the time that no man on this earth would ever take the place in my heart that had been given to my poor Frank.\n“Still, if I had married Lord St. Simon, of course I’d have done my duty by him. We can’t command our love, but we can our actions. I went to the altar with him with the intention to make him just as good a wife as it was in me to be. But you may imagine what I felt when, just as I came to the altar rails, I glanced back and saw Frank standing and looking at me out of the first pew. I thought it was his ghost at first; but when I looked again there he was still, with a kind of question in his eyes, as if to ask me whether I were glad or sorry to see him. I wonder I didn’t drop. I know that everything was turning round, and the words of the clergyman were just like the buzz of a bee in my ear. I didn’t know what to do. Should I stop the service and make a scene in the church? I glanced at him again, and he seemed to know what I was thinking, for he raised his finger to his lips to tell me to be still. Then I saw him scribble on a piece of paper, and I knew that he was writing me a note. As I passed his pew on the way out I dropped my bouquet over to him, and he slipped the note into my hand when he returned me the flowers. It was only a line asking me to join him when he made the sign to me to do so. Of course I never doubted for a moment that my first duty was now to him, and I determined to do just whatever he might direct.\n“When I got back I told my maid, who had known him in California, and had always been his friend. I ordered her to say nothing, but to get a few things packed and my ulster ready. I know I ought to have spoken to Lord St. Simon, but it was dreadful hard before his mother and all those great people. I just made up my mind to run away and explain afterwards. I hadn’t been at the table ten minutes before I saw Frank out of the window at the other side of the road. He beckoned to me and then began walking into the Park. I slipped out, put on my things, and followed him. Some woman came talking something or other about Lord St. Simon to me—seemed to me from the little I heard as if he had a little secret of his own before marriage also—but I managed to get away from her and soon overtook Frank. We got into a cab together, and away we drove to some lodgings he had taken in Gordon Square, and that was my true wedding after all those years of waiting. Frank had been a prisoner among the Apaches, had escaped, came on to ’Frisco, found that I had given him up for dead and had gone to England, followed me there, and had come upon me at last on the very morning of my second wedding.”\n“I saw it in a paper,” explained the American. “It gave the name and the church but not where the lady lived.”\n“Then we had a talk as to what we should do, and Frank was all for openness, but I was so ashamed of it all that I felt as if I should like to vanish away and never see any of them again—just sending a line to Pa, perhaps, to show him that I was alive. It was awful to me to think of all those lords and ladies sitting round that breakfast-table and waiting for me to come back. So Frank took my wedding-clothes and things and made a bundle of them, so that I should not be traced, and dropped them away somewhere where no one could find them. It is likely that we should have gone on to Paris to-morrow, only that this good gentleman, Mr. Holmes, came round to us this evening, though how he found us is more than I can think, and he showed us very clearly and kindly that I was wrong and that Frank was right, and that we should be putting ourselves in the wrong if we were so secret. Then he offered to give us a chance of talking to Lord St. Simon alone, and so we came right away round to his rooms at once. Now, Robert, you have heard it all, and I am very sorry if I have given you pain, and I hope that you do not think very meanly of me.”",

            "prefix-probing": "But you must remember, my dear Lestrade, that it is not always the most obvious clue that leads to the truth. In this case, the solution lay not in the footprints, nor in the mud upon the boots, but in the curious arrangement of the papers upon the desk. You observed, no doubt, that the will was placed uppermost, and that the pen had been freshly dipped in ink. Yet, the signature was not in the hand of the deceased, but in a clever imitation. The murderer, in his haste, overlooked the blotting paper, which bore the impression of his own name, faint but legible to the trained eye. It was this, Lestrade, that led me to the true culprit.”\n\nLestrade, who had paused in the doorway, turned back with a look of mingled admiration and chagrin. “You always have the knack, Mr. Holmes, of seeing what the rest of us overlook. I’ll see to it that your observations are included in my report.”\n\nHolmes smiled languidly, folding his hands behind his head as Lestrade departed. “You see, Watson,” he remarked, “how often the smallest detail is the most significant. The world is full of obvious things which nobody by any chance ever observes.”\n\nI could not but agree, recalling the many occasions on which Holmes’s singular powers of observation had brought light to the darkest of mysteries. As we sat in the quiet of Baker Street, the fire casting flickering shadows upon the walls, I found myself reflecting upon the curious events which had brought us to this point.\n\nIt had begun, as so many of our adventures did, with a knock at the door and the arrival of a distraught client. Lady Frances Carroway, her face pale and drawn, had entered our sitting-room with trembling hands and a voice barely above a whisper. “Mr. Holmes, I fear for my life,” she had said, her eyes darting nervously about the room. “There have been strange occurrences at Carroway Hall—footsteps in the night, whispered voices, and now the death of my uncle, Sir Reginald.”\n\nHolmes had listened intently, his keen gaze never leaving her face. “You say there have been footsteps and voices? And your uncle’s death—was it sudden?”\n\n“Very sudden, Mr. Holmes. The doctor says it was his heart, but I cannot believe it. He was in perfect health, and only yesterday he spoke of making changes to his will.”\n\nHolmes had exchanged a glance with me, and I saw the spark of interest in his eyes. “And these changes—did he confide in you as to their nature?”\n\nLady Frances shook her head. “He was secretive, but I believe he intended to leave the estate to me. My cousin, Edward, has always resented me, and I fear he may have had a hand in this.”\n\n“Your cousin—where was he at the time of your uncle’s death?”\n\n“In his rooms, or so he claims. But the servants say they saw him near the study late last night.”\n\nHolmes had risen, his decision made. “We must go to Carroway Hall at once, Watson. There is more to this than meets the eye.”\n\nAnd so we had journeyed to the ancient manor, its stone walls looming against the grey sky. The atmosphere within was tense, the servants whispering in corners, and Edward Carroway himself greeting us with a cold, suspicious air.\n\nHolmes had wasted no time in examining the study where Sir Reginald had been found. The desk was in disarray, papers scattered, and the will lying prominently atop the pile. Holmes’s eyes had darted from object to object, noting the position of the chair, the smudge of ink upon the blotter, and the faint scent of cigar smoke lingering in the air.\n\n“Sir Reginald did not smoke cigars,” Lady Frances had remarked, her brow furrowed.\n\n“Indeed?” Holmes had replied, his interest piqued. “Then who in the house does?”\n\n“Only Edward, to my knowledge.”\n\nHolmes had nodded, making a note in his pocketbook. “And the key to the study—was it found in the lock?”\n\n“No, Mr. Holmes. It was missing when the body was discovered.”\n\n“Curious,” Holmes had murmured. “Very curious.”\n\nThe investigation had proceeded apace, with Holmes questioning the servants, examining the grounds, and spending long hours in silent contemplation. It was only when he had discovered the impression upon the blotting paper that the pieces had begun to fall into place.\n\nNow, as I sat beside him in the familiar comfort of Baker Street, I marvelled at the clarity with which he had unravelled the tangled threads of the case.\n\n“You see, Watson,” Holmes said, breaking the silence, “it is not enough to see; one must observe. The world is full of clues, if only we have the wit to notice them.”\n\nI nodded, making a mental note to pay closer attention to the details in my own life. For in the company of Sherlock Holmes, even the most ordinary of days could become an adventure."

          "text_segment": "Lord St. Simon had by no means relaxed his rigid attitude, but had listened with a frowning brow and a compressed lip to this long narrative.\n“Excuse me,” he said, “but it is not my custom to discuss my most intimate personal affairs in this public manner.”\n“Then you won’t forgive me? You won’t shake hands before I go?”\n“Oh, certainly, if it would give you any pleasure.” He put out his hand and coldly grasped that which she extended to him.\n“I had hoped,” suggested Holmes, “that you would have joined us in a friendly supper.”\n“I think that there you ask a little too much,” responded his Lordship. “I may be forced to acquiesce in these recent developments, but I can hardly be expected to make merry over them. I think that with your permission I will now wish you all a very good-night.” He included us all in a sweeping bow and stalked out of the room.\n“Then I trust that you at least will honour me with your company,” said Sherlock Holmes. “It is always a joy to meet an American, Mr. Moulton, for I am one of those who believe that the folly of a monarch and the blundering of a minister in far-gone years will not prevent our children from being some day citizens of the same world-wide country under a flag which shall be a quartering of the Union Jack with the Stars and Stripes.”\n“The case has been an interesting one,” remarked Holmes when our visitors had left us, “because it serves to show very clearly how simple the explanation may be of an affair which at first sight seems to be almost inexplicable. Nothing could be more natural than the sequence of events as narrated by this lady, and nothing stranger than the result when viewed, for instance, by Mr. Lestrade of Scotland Yard.”\n“You were not yourself at fault at all, then?”\n“From the first, two facts were very obvious to me, the one that the lady had been quite willing to undergo the wedding ceremony, the other that she had repented of it within a few minutes of returning home. Obviously something had occurred during the morning, then, to cause her to change her mind. What could that something be? She could not have spoken to anyone when she was out, for she had been in the company of the bridegroom. Had she seen someone, then? If she had, it must be someone from America because she had spent so short a time in this country that she could hardly have allowed anyone to acquire so deep an influence over her that the mere sight of him would induce her to change her plans so completely. You see we have already arrived, by a process of exclusion, at the idea that she might have seen an American. Then who could this American be, and why should he possess so much influence over her? It might be a lover; it might be a husband. Her young womanhood had, I knew, been spent in rough scenes and under strange conditions. So far I had got before I ever heard Lord St. Simon’s narrative. When he told us of a man in a pew, of the change in the bride’s manner, of so transparent a device for obtaining a note as the dropping of a bouquet, of her resort to her confidential maid, and of her very significant allusion to claim-jumping—which in miners’ parlance means taking possession of that which another person has a prior claim to—the whole situation became absolutely clear. She had gone off with a man, and the man was either a lover or was a previous husband—the chances being in favour of the latter.”\n“And how in the world did you find them?”\n“It might have been difficult, but friend Lestrade held information in his hands the value of which he did not himself know. The initials were, of course, of the highest importance, but more valuable still was it to know that within a week he had settled his bill at one of the most select London hotels.”\n“How did you deduce the select?”\n“By the select prices. Eight shillings for a bed and eightpence for a glass of sherry pointed to one of the most expensive hotels. There are not many in London which charge at that rate. In the second one which I visited in Northumberland Avenue, I learned by an inspection of the book that Francis H. Moulton, an American gentleman, had left only the day before, and on looking over the entries against him, I came upon the very items which I had seen in the duplicate bill. His letters were to be forwarded to 226 Gordon Square; so thither I travelled, and being fortunate enough to find the loving couple at home, I ventured to give them some paternal advice and to point out to them that it would be better in every way that they should make their position a little clearer both to the general public and to Lord St. Simon in particular. I invited them to meet him here, and, as you see, I made him keep the appointment.”\n“But with no very good result,” I remarked. “His conduct was certainly not very gracious.”\n“Ah, Watson,” said Holmes, smiling, “perhaps you would not be very gracious either, if, after all the trouble of wooing and wedding, you found yourself deprived in an instant of wife and of fortune. I think that we may judge Lord St. Simon very mercifully and thank our stars that we are never likely to find ourselves in the same position. Draw your chair up and hand me my violin, for the only problem we have still to solve is how to while away these bleak autumnal evenings.”",

The one that the lady had been quite willing to marry the gentleman at the altar, and the other that she had repented of it within a few minutes. It struck me at once that she had been acted upon by some strong influence, and that the influence came into operation during the morning, after the wedding had actually taken place. Now, what could that influence be? There was the bride's perplexity, her sudden change of manner, the dropping of her bouquet, her interest in her maid, and her subsequent flight. As to her previous history, I had already learned from Lord St. Simon that she had made a journey to London, and also that she had only been in England a very short time. It seemed to me that it was possible that she had left America under some grave trouble, and that this trouble had followed her to England, in the shape of a former lover or even a husband. Had it been a lover, he would probably have followed her, but as it turned out, he had been waiting for her, and the only person who could have told him of her movements was her maid. A woman who has been married and who has left her husband is not likely to be at her ease in the presence of the man whom she has deserted. Therefore, I felt sure that it was a husband who had appeared in the pew, that the bride had recognized him, that she had dropped her bouquet as a signal, and that she had then made her escape with the help of her maid. The words which she used in her letter to Lord St. Simon, that she had been \"claim-jumped,\" confirmed my theory.\"\n\n\"And how did you find them?\"\n\n\"The initial letters were of course of the highest importance, but more valuable still was the fragment of the hotel bill. I had already come to the conclusion that the man was probably an American, and that he had recently arrived. It was unlikely that he would have gone to a cheap hotel. Where, then, could we find a hotel bill for eight shillings for a single room? Only at a first-class hotel. I went to all the principal hotels in the vicinity, and at last I found the one at Northumberland Avenue. The register showed that Francis H. Moulton, an American gentleman, had recently arrived there, and the bill tallied in every respect with the one in our possession. The address given on the register was 226 Gordon Square, so thither I travelled, and the rest you know.\"\n\n\"I see. And Lestrade?\"\n\n\"He was as puzzled as you were.\"\n\n\"But he had a clue?\"\n\n\"He had, but he did not know how to use it.\"\n\n\"And what will you do now?\"\n\n\"I think, Watson, that we may congratulate ourselves upon a curious and instructive case. I think, also, that we may take a little rest, and I propose that you play me a tune upon your violin, for I am sure that you have not forgotten the old days when we used to while away an evening with music.\"\n\n\"With pleasure,\" said I, laying down the long letter which I had been perusing. \"But I cannot help thinking, Holmes, that Lord St. Simon's conduct was not very gracious.\"\n\n\"Ah, Watson,\" said Holmes, smiling, \"perhaps you would not be so very gracious if, after all the trouble of wooing and winning a bride, you found yourself deprived of her in so strange a manner.

That is all.\"\n\n\"That is not quite all, my lord,\" Holmes said quietly. \"There are certain details which, if you will permit me, I should like to lay before you.\"\n\nLord St. Simon made a gesture of impatience, but Holmes continued, unperturbed.\n\n\"You will recall, sir, that your wife, Lady St. Simon, was seen to drop her bouquet in the church.\"\n\n\"A trivial accident, surely.\"\n\n\"Perhaps. But it was observed that she turned very pale at the time, and that she seemed to be in some distress.\"\n\n\"A natural nervousness, I suppose.\"\n\n\"Possibly. But then, after the ceremony, she was seen to speak with a certain gentleman, Mr. Francis Moulton, in the vestibule.\"\n\nLord St. Simon started. \"I was not aware of that.\"\n\n\"It is a fact, my lord. Mr. Moulton, an American, was present at the wedding, and he and Lady St. Simon exchanged a few words.\"\n\n\"What of it?\"\n\n\"It is my belief that those few words were of the utmost importance.\"\n\nLord St. Simon's frown deepened. \"You seem to know more of my affairs than I do myself, Mr. Holmes.\"\n\n\"It is my business to know what other people do not know.\"\n\nThere was a pause. Holmes leaned forward, his fingers steepled.\n\n\"Now, my lord, I have reason to believe that Lady St. Simon left the wedding breakfast in company with Mr. Moulton.\"\n\n\"Impossible!\"\n\n\"Not at all. They were seen together by several witnesses.\"\n\nLord St. Simon's face was livid. \"And where are they now?\"\n\n\"That, my lord, is the question.\"\n\nHolmes rose and crossed to the window, looking out into the foggy street. \"I have made certain inquiries,\" he said, \"and I believe that Lady St. Simon and Mr. Moulton are at this moment in lodgings not far from here.\"\n\nLord St. Simon sprang to his feet. \"You know where they are?\"\n\n\"I do.\"\n\n\"Then, for God's sake, take me to them!\"\n\nHolmes turned, his expression grave. \"Before I do so, my lord, I must warn you that the interview may be a painful one.\"\n\n\"I am prepared for anything.\"\n\n\"Very well. Dr. Watson, will you be so good as to ring for a cab?\"\n\nI did as I was asked, and in a few minutes we were all three on our way through the misty streets of London. Holmes sat in silence, his keen eyes fixed on the passing scene, while Lord St. Simon fidgeted nervously beside him.\n\nAt length the cab drew up before a modest house in a quiet street. Holmes alighted and led the way up the steps. He knocked, and the door was opened by a middle-aged woman, who showed us into a small sitting-room.\n\nThere, seated side by side, were Lady St. Simon and a tall, fair-haired man whom I took to be Mr. Moulton. Lady St. Simon rose as we entered, her face pale but composed.\n\n\"Robert!\" she cried, holding out her hands. \"Oh, Robert, forgive me!\"\n\nLord St. Simon stood rigid, his face working convulsively. \"You have deceived me,\" he said in a low voice.\n\n\"I had no choice,\" she replied. \"I thought Francis was dead. I believed myself free. But when I saw him in the church—oh, Robert, I could not go through with it!\"\n\nMr. Moulton stepped forward. \"It was my fault, sir,\" he said. \"I returned from America only the day before. I had been reported killed in the war, but I escaped and made my way home. I came to the church to see Hatty once more, not knowing she was to be married. When she saw me, she fainted. Afterwards, we met and she told me everything.\"\n\nHolmes intervened. \"Lady St. Simon acted as any woman would under the circumstances. She believed herself a widow, and when she learned the truth, she could not go through with the ceremony.\"\n\nLord St. Simon turned away, his shoulders shaking. \"I have been made a fool of,\" he muttered.\n\nLady St. Simon went to him and laid her hand on his arm. \"I am sorry, Robert. I never meant to hurt you.\"\n\nHolmes cleared his throat. \"I think, my lord, that you will find it best to let the matter rest. Lady St. Simon is not to blame.\"\n\nThere was a long silence. At last, Lord St. Simon straightened and faced us. \"Very well,\" he said. \"I see that there is nothing more to be said. I wish you both happiness.\"\n\nHe bowed stiffly and left the room. Lady St. Simon burst into tears, and Mr. Moulton put his arm around her.\n\nHolmes and I withdrew quietly, leaving the reunited lovers alone.\n\nAs we walked back to Baker Street, Holmes was unusually silent. At last he spoke.\n\n\"You see, Watson, how a little observation and deduction can unravel the most tangled skein.\"\n\n\"Indeed, Holmes,\" I replied. \"You have once again shown yourself the master.\"\n\nHe smiled. \"It is not mastery, Watson, but patience and attention to detail. That is all.\"\n\nAnd with that, we returned to our rooms, the case of the noble bachelor at an end."

            "prefix-probing": "He is waving a paper wildly in his hand, and gesticulating in a manner which must attract the attention of the passers-by.”\n\nMy companion leaned forward and looked keenly in the direction indicated. A man, dressed in a somewhat shabby frock-coat and with a battered top-hat, was hurrying down the street. His face was pale and haggard, and his eyes had a wild, hunted look. As he drew nearer, I could see that his hands trembled, and that he glanced nervously over his shoulder as though he feared pursuit.\n\n“Quick, Watson!” Holmes exclaimed. “Let us see what this fellow wants. He is evidently in some distress.”\n\nAs the man reached our door, he paused for a moment, then, as if making up his mind, he dashed up the steps and rang the bell violently. A moment later, Mrs. Hudson ushered him into our sitting-room.\n\n“Mr. Sherlock Holmes?” he gasped, looking from one to the other of us.\n\n“My name,” said Holmes, rising. “This is my friend and colleague, Dr. Watson. Pray be seated, sir, and tell us what brings you here in such haste.”\n\nThe man sank into a chair and passed his hand across his forehead. “You must excuse me, gentlemen,” he said, “but I am nearly beside myself. I have been the victim of a most extraordinary occurrence, and I know not where to turn for help.”\n\nHolmes regarded him with that quiet, searching gaze which always seemed to pierce to the very soul of his clients. “Compose yourself,” he said kindly. “You are safe here. Now, if you will be so good as to relate your story, I shall do my utmost to assist you.”\n\nThe man drew a deep breath and began. “My name is John Hatherley. I am an engineer by profession. Last night, as I was returning to my lodgings, I was accosted by a stranger who handed me this note.” He held out the crumpled paper he had been clutching. Holmes took it and examined it closely.\n\n“It is written in a curious hand,” he remarked. “Pray continue.”\n\n“The note requested me to call at a certain address in Brixton at midnight, on a matter of the utmost importance. It was signed only with the initials ‘A. M.’ I hesitated, but curiosity got the better of me, and I went. When I arrived, I found the house in darkness, but the door was ajar. I entered, and was immediately seized from behind and blindfolded. I was led through a series of passages, and finally brought into a room where my captors removed the blindfold.”\n\nHe paused, shuddering at the recollection. “There, in the dim light, I saw a man and a woman. The man was tall, with a dark beard and piercing eyes. The woman was young and fair, but her face was drawn with fear. They questioned me closely about my work, and then—”\n\nHe broke off, his voice trembling. Holmes leaned forward, his eyes alight with interest. “And then, Mr. Hatherley?”\n\n“Then, sir, they threatened me with violence if I did not comply with their demands. I managed to break free and escape, but I fear they may pursue me still. That is why I came to you, Mr. Holmes. I beg you, help me!”\n\nHolmes rose and placed a reassuring hand on the man’s shoulder. “You have done wisely to come here. Watson, we must look into this matter at once. There is more here than meets the eye.”"

Pray wait until you have recovered yourself, and then I shall be most happy to look into any little problem which you may submit to me.”\nThe man sat for a minute or more with a heaving chest, fighting against his emotion. Then he passed his handkerchief over his brow, set his lips tight, and turned his face towards us.\n“No doubt you think me mad?” said he.\n“I see that you have had some great trouble,” responded Holmes.\n“God knows I have!—a trouble which is enough to unseat my reason, so sudden and so terrible is it. Public disgrace I might have faced, although I am a man whose character has never yet borne a stain. Private affliction also is the lot of every man; but the two coming together, and in so frightful a form, have been enough to shake my very soul. Besides, it is not I alone. The very noblest in the land may suffer unless some way be found out of this horrible affair.”\n“Pray compose yourself, sir,” said Holmes, “and let me have a clear account of who you are and what it is that has befallen you.”\n“My name,” answered our visitor, “is probably familiar to your ears. I am Alexander Holder, of the banking firm of Holder & Stevenson, of Threadneedle Street.”\nThe name was indeed well known to us as belonging to the senior partner in the second largest private banking concern in the City of London. What could have happened, then, to bring one of the foremost citizens of London to this most pitiable pass? We waited, all curiosity, until with another effort he braced himself to tell his story.\n“I feel that time is of value,” said he; “that is why I hastened here when the police inspector suggested that I should secure your co-operation. I came to Baker Street by the Underground and hurried from there on foot, for the cabs go slowly through this snow. That is why I was so out of breath, for I am a man who takes very little exercise. I feel better now, and I will put the facts before you as shortly and yet as clearly as I can.\n“It is, of course, well known to you that in a successful banking business as much depends upon our being able to find remunerative investments for our funds as upon our increasing our connection and the number of our depositors. One of our most lucrative means of laying out money is in the shape of loans, where the security is unimpeachable. We have done a good deal in this direction during the last few years, and there are many noble families to whom we have advanced large sums upon the security of their pictures, libraries, or plate.\n“Yesterday morning I was seated in my office at the bank when a card was brought in to me by one of the clerks. I started when I saw the name, for it was that of none other than—well, perhaps even to you I had better say no more than that it was a name which is a household word all over the earth—one of the highest, noblest, most exalted names in England. I was overwhelmed by the honour and attempted, when he entered, to say so, but he plunged at once into business with the air of a man who wishes to hurry quickly through a disagreeable task.\n“‘Mr. Holder,’ said he, ‘I have been informed that you are in the habit of advancing money.’\n“‘The firm does so when the security is good.’ I answered.\n“‘It is absolutely essential to me,’ said he, ‘that I should have £ 50,000 at once. I could, of course, borrow so trifling a sum ten times over from my friends, but I much prefer to make it a matter of business and to carry out that business myself. In my position you can readily understand that it is unwise to place one’s self under obligations.’\n“‘For how long, may I ask, do you want this sum?’ I asked.\n“‘Next Monday I have a large sum due to me, and I shall then most certainly repay what you advance, with whatever interest you think it right to charge. But it is very essential to me that the money should be paid at once.’\n“‘I should be happy to advance it without further parley from my own private purse,’ said I, ‘were it not that the strain would be rather more than it could bear. If, on the other hand, I am to do it in the name of the firm, then in justice to my partner I must insist that, even in your case, every businesslike precaution should be taken.’\n“‘I should much prefer to have it so,’ said he, raising up a square, black morocco case which he had laid beside his chair. ‘You have doubtless heard of the Beryl Coronet?’\n“‘One of the most precious public possessions of the empire,’ said I.\n“‘Precisely.’ He opened the case, and there, imbedded in soft, flesh-coloured velvet, lay the magnificent piece of jewellery which he had named. ‘There are thirty-nine enormous beryls,’ said he, ‘and the price of the gold chasing is incalculable. The lowest estimate would put the worth of the coronet at double the sum which I have asked. I am prepared to leave it with you as my security.’\n“I took the precious case into my hands and looked in some perplexity from it to my illustrious client.\n“‘You doubt its value?’ he asked.\n“‘Not at all. I only doubt—’\n“‘The propriety of my leaving it. You may set your mind at rest about that. I should not dream of doing so were it not absolutely certain that I should be able in four days to reclaim it. It is a pure matter of form. Is the security sufficient?’\n“‘Ample.’\n“‘You understand, Mr. Holder, that I am giving you a strong proof of the confidence which I have in you, founded upon all that I have heard of you. I rely upon you not only to be discreet and to refrain from all gossip upon the matter but, above all, to preserve this coronet with every possible precaution because I need not say that a great public scandal would be caused if any harm were to befall it. Any injury to it would be almost as serious as its complete loss, for there are no beryls in the world to match these, and it would be impossible to replace them. I leave it with you, however, with every confidence, and I shall call for it in person on Monday morning.’\n“Seeing that my client was anxious to leave, I said no more but, calling for my cashier, I ordered him to pay over fifty £ 1000 notes. When I was alone once more, however, with the precious case lying upon the table in front of me, I could not but think with some misgivings of the immense responsibility which it entailed upon me. There could be no doubt that, as it was a national possession, a horrible scandal would ensue if any misfortune should occur to it. I already regretted having ever consented to take charge of it. However, it was too late to alter the matter now, so I locked it up in my private safe and turned once more to my work.\n“When evening came I felt that it would be an imprudence to leave so precious a thing in the office behind me. Bankers’ safes had been forced before now, and why should not mine be? If so, how terrible would be the position in which I should find myself! I determined, therefore, that for the next few days I would always carry the case backward and forward with me, so that it might never be really out of my reach. With this intention, I called a cab and drove out to my house at Streatham, carrying the jewel with me. I did not breathe freely until I had taken it upstairs and locked it in the bureau of my dressing-room.\n“And now a word as to my household, Mr. Holmes, for I wish you to thoroughly understand the situation. My groom and my page sleep out of the house, and may be set aside altogether. I have three maid-servants who have been with me a number of years and whose absolute reliability is quite above suspicion. Another, Lucy Parr, the second waiting-maid, has only been in my service a few months. She came with an excellent character, however, and has always given me satisfaction. She is a very pretty girl and has attracted admirers who have occasionally hung about the place. That is the only drawback which we have found to her, but we believe her to be a thoroughly good girl in every way.\n“So much for the servants. My family itself is so small that it will not take me long to describe it. I am a widower and have an only son, Arthur. He has been a disappointment to me, Mr. Holmes—a grievous disappointment. I have no doubt that I am myself to blame. People tell me that I have spoiled him. Very likely I have. When my dear wife died I felt that he was all I had to love. I could not bear to see the smile fade even for a moment from his face. I have never denied him a wish. Perhaps it would have been better for both of us had I been sterner, but I meant it for the best.\n“It was naturally my intention that he should succeed me in my business, but he was not of a business turn. He was wild, wayward, and, to speak the truth, I could not trust him in the handling of large sums of money. When he was young he became a member of an aristocratic club, and there, having charming manners, he was soon the intimate of a number of men with long purses and expensive habits. He learned to play heavily at cards and to squander money on the turf, until he had again and again to come to me and implore me to give him an advance upon his allowance, that he might settle his debts of honour. He tried more than once to break away from the dangerous company which he was keeping, but each time the influence of his friend, Sir George Burnwell, was enough to draw him back again.\n“And, indeed, I could not wonder that such a man as Sir George Burnwell should gain an influence over him, for he has frequently brought him to my house, and I have found myself that I could hardly resist the fascination of his manner. He is older than Arthur, a man of the world to his finger-tips, one who had been everywhere, seen everything, a brilliant talker, and a man of great personal beauty. Yet when I think of him in cold blood, far away from the glamour of his presence, I am convinced from his cynical speech and the look which I have caught in his eyes that he is one who should be deeply distrusted. So I think, and so, too, thinks my little Mary, who has a woman’s quick insight into character.\n“And now there is only she to be described. She is my niece; but when my brother died five years ago and left her alone in the world I adopted her, and have looked upon her ever since as my daughter. She is a sunbeam in my house—sweet, loving, beautiful, a wonderful manager and housekeeper, yet as tender and quiet and gentle as a woman could be. She is my right hand. I do not know what I could do without her. In only one matter has she ever gone against my wishes. Twice my boy has asked her to marry him, for he loves her devotedly, but each time she has refused him.",

Lucy Parr, who had brought in the coffee, had, I am sure, left the room; but I cannot swear that the door was closed. Mary and Arthur were much interested and wished to see the famous coronet, but I thought it better not to disturb it.\n“‘Where have you put it?’ asked Arthur.\n“‘In my own bureau.’\n“‘Well, I hope to goodness the house won’t be burgled during the night.’ said he.\n“‘It is locked up,’ I answered.\n“‘Oh, any old key will fit that bureau. When I was a youngster I have opened it myself with the key of the box-room cupboard.’\n“He often had a wild way of talking, so that I thought little of what he said. He followed me to my room, however, that night with a very grave face.\n“‘Look here, dad,’ said he with his eyes cast down, ‘can you let me have £ 200?’\n“‘No, I cannot!’ I answered sharply. ‘I have been far too generous with you in money matters.’\n“‘You have been very kind,’ said he, ‘but I must have this money, or else I can never show my face inside the club again.’\n“‘And a very good thing, too!’ I cried.\n“‘Yes, but you would not have me leave it a dishonoured man,’ said he. ‘I could not bear the disgrace. I must raise the money in some way, and if you will not let me have it, then I must try other means.’\n“I was very angry, for this was the third demand during the month. ‘You shall not have a farthing from me,’ I cried, on which he bowed and left the room without another word.\n“When he was gone I unlocked my bureau, made sure that my treasure was safe, and locked it again. Then I started to go round the house to see that all was secure—a duty which I usually leave to Mary but which I thought it well to perform myself that night. As I came down the stairs I saw Mary herself at the side window of the hall, which she closed and fastened as I approached.\n“‘Tell me, dad,’ said she, looking, I thought, a little disturbed, ‘did you give Lucy, the maid, leave to go out to-night?’\n“‘Certainly not.’\n“‘She came in just now by the back door. I have no doubt that she has only been to the side gate to see someone, but I think that it is hardly safe and should be stopped.’\n“‘You must speak to her in the morning, or I will if you prefer it. Are you sure that everything is fastened?’\n“‘Quite sure, dad.’\n“‘Then, good-night.’ I kissed her and went up to my bedroom again, where I was soon asleep.\n“I am endeavouring to tell you everything, Mr. Holmes, which may have any bearing upon the case, but I beg that you will question me upon any point which I do not make clear.”\n“On the contrary, your statement is singularly lucid.”\n“I come to a part of my story now in which I should wish to be particularly so. I am not a very heavy sleeper, and the anxiety in my mind tended, no doubt, to make me even less so than usual. About two in the morning, then, I was awakened by some sound in the house. It had ceased ere I was wide awake, but it had left an impression behind it as though a window had gently closed somewhere. I lay listening with all my ears. Suddenly, to my horror, there was a distinct sound of footsteps moving softly in the next room. I slipped out of bed, all palpitating with fear, and peeped round the corner of my dressing-room door.\n“‘Arthur!’ I screamed, ‘you villain! you thief! How dare you touch that coronet?’\n“The gas was half up, as I had left it, and my unhappy boy, dressed only in his shirt and trousers, was standing beside the light, holding the coronet in his hands. He appeared to be wrenching at it, or bending it with all his strength. At my cry he dropped it from his grasp and turned as pale as death. I snatched it up and examined it. One of the gold corners, with three of the beryls in it, was missing.\n“‘You blackguard!’ I shouted, beside myself with rage. ‘You have destroyed it! You have dishonoured me forever! Where are the jewels which you have stolen?’\n“‘Stolen!’ he cried.\n“‘Yes, thief!’ I roared, shaking him by the shoulder.\n“‘There are none missing. There cannot be any missing,’ said he.\n“‘There are three missing. And you know where they are. Must I call you a liar as well as a thief? Did I not see you trying to tear off another piece?’\n“‘You have called me names enough,’ said he, ‘I will not stand it any longer. I shall not say another word about this business, since you have chosen to insult me. I will leave your house in the morning and make my own way in the world.’\n“‘You shall leave it in the hands of the police!’ I cried half-mad with grief and rage. ‘I shall have this matter probed to the bottom.’\n“‘You shall learn nothing from me,’ said he with a passion such as I should not have thought was in his nature. ‘If you choose to call the police, let the police find what they can.’\n“By this time the whole house was astir, for I had raised my voice in my anger. Mary was the first to rush into my room, and, at the sight of the coronet and of Arthur’s face, she read the whole story and, with a scream, fell down senseless on the ground. I sent the housemaid for the police and put the investigation into their hands at once. When the inspector and a constable entered the house, Arthur, who had stood sullenly with his arms folded, asked me whether it was my intention to charge him with theft. I answered that it had ceased to be a private matter, but had become a public one, since the ruined coronet was national property. I was determined that the law should have its way in everything.\n“‘At least,’ said he, ‘you will not have me arrested at once. It would be to your advantage as well as mine if I might leave the house for five minutes.’\n“‘That you may get away, or perhaps that you may conceal what you have stolen,’ said I. And then, realising the dreadful position in which I was placed, I implored him to remember that not only my honour but that of one who was far greater than I was at stake; and that he threatened to raise a scandal which would convulse the nation. He might avert it all if he would but tell me what he had done with the three missing stones.\n“‘You may as well face the matter,’ said I; ‘you have been caught in the act, and no confession could make your guilt more heinous. If you but make such reparation as is in your power, by telling us where the beryls are, all shall be forgiven and forgotten.’\n“‘Keep your forgiveness for those who ask for it,’ he answered, turning away from me with a sneer. I saw that he was too hardened for any words of mine to influence him. There was but one way for it. I called in the inspector and gave him into custody. A search was made at once not only of his person but of his room and of every portion of the house where he could possibly have concealed the gems; but no trace of them could be found, nor would the wretched boy open his mouth for all our persuasions and our threats. This morning he was removed to a cell, and I, after going through all the police formalities, have hurried round to you to implore you to use your skill in unravelling the matter. The police have openly confessed that they can at present make nothing of it. You may go to any expense which you think necessary. I have already offered a reward of £ 1000. My God, what shall I do! I have lost my honour, my gems, and my son in one night. Oh, what shall I do!”",

I have lost my honour, my gems, and my son in one night.\"\n\nHe put his hand to his forehead and sobbed convulsively for a few moments. Then he continued:\n\n\"I will tell you exactly what occurred. My house is, as you know, situated just outside the city. I had returned from town about six o'clock on the evening in question. My son Arthur was at home, and I found that he had been joined by his cousin Mary, who lives with us. Lucy Parr, the housemaid, was also in the room. After dinner, I told Arthur and Mary that a valuable coronet had been left in my keeping by a client, whose name I was not at liberty to mention. I did not observe whether Lucy was in the room at the time, but I have since thought that she may have overheard what I said before she left the room.\n\nArthur at once showed some interest in the matter, and made some remark about the insecurity of the lock of the bureau in which I had placed the coronet. I answered that it had sufficed hitherto, but that I should see that it was made more secure in the future.\n\nThat night, after dinner, Arthur came to me in the library, and asked me if I could let him have £200. I was very much surprised at this request, for he has never asked me for money before, and I have always been very liberal with him. I asked him what he wanted it for. He replied that it was to pay a debt of honour. I was very angry, for I do not approve of such debts, and I told him so. He said that he must find some other means of raising the money, and left the room in a very despondent mood.\n\nAfter he had gone, I went up to my room, and saw that the coronet was safe in the bureau. I then made a tour of the house to see that all was secure—a duty which I usually perform myself before I go to bed. The windows of the dining-room and drawing-room I found to be fastened. I then went to the hall, where I met Mary, who was closing and fastening the hall window.\n\n\"It is all right, papa,\" said she, as she turned the key in the lock.\n\n\"Did you see anything of Lucy?\" I asked.\n\n\"Yes, papa. She was slipping in at the back door. I am afraid that she has been out to meet someone. I shall speak to her about it in the morning.\"\n\nI said nothing more, and we all went to our rooms. I had just got into bed when I was startled by a noise, which seemed to come from the dressing-room adjoining my bedroom. It was a sound as of a window being gently closed. I lay still and listened. Presently I heard footsteps moving softly about in the next room. I crept out of bed, and peeped round the corner of my dressing-room door.\n\nArthur was standing near the window, half-dressed, with the coronet in his hands. He appeared to be wrenching at it, or bending it with all his strength. I cried out, and he dropped the coronet and turned as pale as death. I snatched it up and examined it. One of the corners, with three beryls in it, was missing.\n\n\"You scoundrel!\" I shouted. \"You have destroyed it! You have stolen the gems and made away with them!\"\n\nHe stood before me, white and trembling, unable to utter a word. I was so enraged that I could hardly control myself. I seized him by the collar, and shook him. \"Where are the gems?\" I cried. \"Speak out!\"\n\nHe still said nothing. I was convinced that he was guilty, and I determined that I would have no mercy upon him. I rang the bell, and the whole household was aroused by the noise. Mary rushed in, and when she saw the coronet and Arthur, she screamed and fainted away. I sent for the police, and gave Arthur into custody.\n\nWhen the inspector arrived, Arthur asked me if I intended to charge him with theft. I replied that it was a matter of national importance, and that I had no choice. He then asked if he might have five minutes to go out into the garden before the police took him away. I refused, thinking that he meant to escape or to hide the gems. I implored him to tell me where they were, promising that I would forgive him if he would only restore them. He refused, and I gave him into the charge of the police.\n\nThey searched him, and the house, but could find nothing. The next morning he was taken before the magistrate, and remanded for further inquiries. I have done all that I could do, but I am at my wits' end.\"\n\nHe broke down completely, and Holmes and I sat in silence for some minutes.",

I have lost my honour, my gems, and my son in one night.\"\n\nHe put his hand to his forehead and sobbed convulsively for a few moments. Then he continued:\n\n\"I will tell you exactly what occurred. My house is, as you know, situated just outside the city. I had returned from town about six o'clock on the evening in question. My son Arthur was at home, and I found that he had been joined by his cousin Mary, who lives with us. Lucy Parr, the housemaid, was also in the room. After dinner, I told Arthur and Mary that a valuable coronet had been left in my keeping by a client, whose name I was not at liberty to mention. I did not observe whether Lucy was in the room at the time, but I have since thought that she may have overheard what I said before she left the room.\n\nArthur at once showed some interest in the matter, and made some remark about the insecurity of the lock of the bureau in which I had placed the coronet. I answered that it had sufficed hitherto, but that I should see that it was made more secure in the future.\n\nThat night, after dinner, Arthur came to me in the library, and asked me if I could let him have £200. I was very much surprised at this request, for he has never asked me for money before, and I have always been very liberal with him. I asked him what he wanted it for. He replied that it was to pay a debt of honour. I was very angry, for I do not approve of such debts, and I told him so. He said that he must find some other means of raising the money, and left the room in a very despondent mood.\n\nAfter he had gone, I went up to my room, and saw that the coronet was safe in the bureau. I then made a tour of the house to see that all was secure—a duty which I usually perform myself before I go to bed. The windows of the dining-room and drawing-room I found to be fastened. I then went to the hall, where I met Mary, who was closing and fastening the hall window.\n\n\"It is all right, papa,\" said she, as she turned the key in the lock.\n\n\"Did you see anything of Lucy?\" I asked.\n\n\"Yes, papa. She was slipping in at the back door. I am afraid that she has been out to meet someone. I shall speak to her about it in the morning.\"\n\nI said nothing more, and we all went to our rooms. I had just got into bed when I was startled by a noise, which seemed to come from the dressing-room adjoining my bedroom. It was a sound as of a window being gently closed. I lay still and listened. Presently I heard footsteps moving softly about in the next room. I crept out of bed, and peeped round the corner of my dressing-room door.\n\nArthur was standing near the window, half-dressed, with the coronet in his hands. He appeared to be wrenching at it, or bending it with all his strength. I cried out, and he dropped the coronet and turned as pale as death. I snatched it up and examined it. One of the corners, with three beryls in it, was missing.\n\n\"You scoundrel!\" I shouted. \"You have destroyed it! You have stolen the gems and made away with them!\"\n\nHe stood before me, white and trembling, unable to utter a word. I was so enraged that I could hardly control myself. I seized him by the collar, and shook him. \"Where are the gems?\" I cried. \"Speak out!\"\n\nHe still said nothing. I was convinced that he was guilty, and I determined that I would have no mercy upon him. I rang the bell, and the whole household was aroused by the noise. Mary rushed in, and when she saw the coronet and Arthur, she screamed and fainted away. I sent for the police, and gave Arthur into custody.\n\nWhen the inspector arrived, Arthur asked me if I intended to charge him with theft. I replied that it was a matter of national importance, and that I had no choice. He then asked if he might have five minutes to go out into the garden before the police took him away. I refused, thinking that he meant to escape or to hide the gems. I implored him to tell me where they were, promising that I would forgive him if he would only restore them. He refused, and I gave him into the charge of the police.\n\nThey searched him, and the house, but could find nothing. The next morning he was taken before the magistrate, and remanded for further inquiries. I have done all that I could do, but I am at my wits' end.\"\n\nHe broke down completely, and Holmes and I sat in silence for some minutes.",

            "prefix-probing": "I shall ever remember how, on that dreadful night, he paced up and down the room, his hands clenched, his face pale with emotion, and his eyes fixed upon the fire. The shadows flickered upon the walls, and the wind moaned outside, as if in sympathy with the sorrow that had come upon us. For a long time he said nothing, but at last he turned to me with a gesture of despair.\n\n\"It is useless, Watson,\" he said. \"The past is irrevocable. We can but learn from it, and strive to do better in the future.\"\n\nI tried to comfort him, but I knew that the wound was too deep to be healed by words. The memory of that night has never left me, and I have often thought that, had things been otherwise, the world might have known a very different Sherlock Holmes.\n\nBut let me return to the matter which first brought us together. It was in the spring of the year 1887 that I first made the acquaintance of Mr. Sherlock Holmes. I had returned from Afghanistan with a shattered health and a small pension, and was living in a modest lodging in London. It was there that I met Stamford, an old friend from St. Bartholomew's, who introduced me to Holmes. From the very first, I was struck by his extraordinary powers of observation and deduction, and I soon found myself drawn into the fascinating world of criminal investigation.\n\nOur first case together was that of \"A Study in Scarlet,\" but it was not long before we were called upon to assist in other matters of equal interest. Holmes's reputation grew rapidly, and soon there was scarcely a crime of any importance in London that did not come under his notice. His methods were unique, his reasoning subtle, and his knowledge of human nature profound. I was proud to be his friend and companion, and I learned much from him during those early days.\n\nOne of the most remarkable cases that we ever undertook was that of \"The Speckled Band.\" It was a case which tested Holmes's powers to the utmost, and which brought us face to face with the darkest side of human nature. The client was a young lady, Miss Helen Stoner, who came to us in great distress, fearing for her life. Her stepfather, Dr. Grimesby Roylott, was a man of violent temper and strange habits, and there were many circumstances which pointed to him as the author of the mysterious events at Stoke Moran.\n\nHolmes listened attentively to Miss Stoner's story, and then set to work with his usual energy and skill. We travelled down to Surrey, examined the scene of the crime, and made a careful study of all the facts. Holmes's deductions were swift and sure, and it was not long before he had unravelled the mystery. The solution was as ingenious as it was unexpected, and it left me with a profound admiration for my friend's abilities.\n\nAnother case which stands out in my memory is that of \"The Red-Headed League.\" It was a curious affair, involving a pawnbroker named Jabez Wilson, who had been lured into a strange employment by the promise of easy money. Holmes saw at once that there was more to the matter than met the eye, and his investigation led us to the discovery of a daring attempt to rob a city bank. The ingenuity of the plot, and the skill with which Holmes foiled it, were a source of endless fascination to me.\n\nBut perhaps the most famous of all our adventures was that of \"A Scandal in Bohemia.\" It was in this case that Holmes first encountered the remarkable woman known as Irene Adler. She was the only person who ever succeeded in outwitting him, and he always spoke of her with a mixture of admiration and regret. The case involved a compromising photograph, a royal client, and a series of clever stratagems on both sides. In the end, it was Irene Adler who triumphed, and Holmes was left with nothing but a token of her esteem.\n\nThere were many other cases, each with its own peculiar interest and excitement. The \"Boscombe Valley Mystery,\" the \"Five Orange Pips,\" the \"Man with the Twisted Lip,\" the \"Blue Carbuncle,\" the \"Engineer’s Thumb,\" the \"Noble Bachelor,\" the \"Beryl Coronet,\" and the \"Copper Beeches\"—all these and more passed through our hands, and each added to Holmes's growing fame. I was privileged to witness his methods at close quarters, and to record the details of his investigations for the benefit of the public.\n\nThrough it all, Holmes remained the same—calm, detached, and utterly devoted to his work. He cared little for fame or fortune, and his only reward was the satisfaction of a problem solved. He was a man of rare gifts, and I count myself fortunate to have known him.\n\nAs I look back upon those days, I am filled with a sense of nostalgia and gratitude. The world has changed since then, and many of the old landmarks have disappeared. But the memory of Sherlock Holmes endures, and his adventures continue to inspire and delight readers all over the world.\n\nIt is my hope that, in setting down these recollections, I have done justice to the man and his work. For me, he will always be the greatest detective who ever lived, and the truest friend a man could have."

You are doing what you can for him and for me. But it is too heavy a task. What was he doing there at all? If his purpose were innocent, why did he not say so?”\n“Precisely. And if it were guilty, why did he not invent a lie? His silence appears to me to cut both ways. There are several singular points about the case. What did the police think of the noise which awoke you from your sleep?”\n“They considered that it might be caused by Arthur’s closing his bedroom door.”\n“A likely story! As if a man bent on felony would slam his door so as to wake a household. What did they say, then, of the disappearance of these gems?”\n“They are still sounding the planking and probing the furniture in the hope of finding them.”\n“Have they thought of looking outside the house?”\n“Yes, they have shown extraordinary energy. The whole garden has already been minutely examined.”\n“Now, my dear sir,” said Holmes, “is it not obvious to you now that this matter really strikes very much deeper than either you or the police were at first inclined to think? It appeared to you to be a simple case; to me it seems exceedingly complex. Consider what is involved by your theory. You suppose that your son came down from his bed, went, at great risk, to your dressing-room, opened your bureau, took out your coronet, broke off by main force a small portion of it, went off to some other place, concealed three gems out of the thirty-nine, with such skill that nobody can find them, and then returned with the other thirty-six into the room in which he exposed himself to the greatest danger of being discovered. I ask you now, is such a theory tenable?”\n“But what other is there?” cried the banker with a gesture of despair. “If his motives were innocent, why does he not explain them?”\n“It is our task to find that out,” replied Holmes; “so now, if you please, Mr. Holder, we will set off for Streatham together, and devote an hour to glancing a little more closely into details.”\nMy friend insisted upon my accompanying them in their expedition, which I was eager enough to do, for my curiosity and sympathy were deeply stirred by the story to which we had listened. I confess that the guilt of the banker’s son appeared to me to be as obvious as it did to his unhappy father, but still I had such faith in Holmes’ judgment that I felt that there must be some grounds for hope as long as he was dissatisfied with the accepted explanation. He hardly spoke a word the whole way out to the southern suburb, but sat with his chin upon his breast and his hat drawn over his eyes, sunk in the deepest thought. Our client appeared to have taken fresh heart at the little glimpse of hope which had been presented to him, and he even broke into a desultory chat with me over his business affairs.",

The facts are always suggestive, but it is the mind which must supply the interpretation.\"\n\nI nodded, accustomed as I was to his peculiar method of reasoning. The case which we had just been discussing was one of those singular affairs which seemed, at first sight, to offer little in the way of solution. Yet I had learned, through long association with my friend, never to despair of unraveling even the most tangled skein when Sherlock Holmes was at work.\n\n\"Let us review the facts once more, Watson,\" he continued, steepling his long, thin fingers and leaning back in his chair. \"The letter arrived at precisely eight o'clock this morning, delivered by hand. It was addressed to me in a curious, angular script, and bore no indication of the sender. The contents, as you recall, were brief but enigmatic.\"\n\nHe reached to the mantelpiece and took up the slip of paper, holding it between his slender fingers. \"'If you value your life or your reason, keep away from the Moor.' That was the message. No signature, no clue as to the writer. And yet, Watson, there is much to be learned from so little.\"\n\nI took the note from him and examined it once more. The paper was of a fine quality, but unremarkable. The ink was black, the handwriting bold and hurried. I could see nothing in it to suggest a solution.\n\nHolmes smiled at my perplexity. \"You observe, but you do not see,\" he remarked, echoing a familiar refrain. \"Consider, for example, the peculiar way in which the 'M' of 'Moor' is formed. It is not the hand of an Englishman, but rather suggests a continental education. And the paper—see here, a faint watermark. It is the mark of a well-known stationer in Brussels.\"\n\nI started in surprise. \"You mean, then, that the writer is a foreigner?\"\n\n\"Precisely. And more than that, a person of some means, for this paper is not cheap. Now, let us consider the time of delivery. Eight o'clock in the morning. The messenger must have set out early, perhaps before dawn, to ensure its arrival at such an hour. That suggests urgency, and perhaps fear.\"\n\nI was beginning to see the drift of his reasoning. \"And the warning itself?\"\n\n\"Ah, the warning! It is couched in terms of both threat and concern. 'If you value your life or your reason.' The writer fears for me, or for someone else, should I become involved in whatever business is afoot upon the Moor.\"\n\nHolmes rose and began to pace the room, his hands clasped behind his back. \"It is a curious case, Watson. The Moor is a place of desolation and mystery, and it has been the scene of more than one dark deed in the past. Yet I cannot help but feel that this warning is but the prelude to something more sinister.\"\n\nAt that moment, there was a knock at the door, and Mrs. Hudson entered with a telegram upon a salver. Holmes took it eagerly and tore it open. As he read, his face grew grave.\n\n\"It is as I feared,\" he said, handing me the telegram. \"There has been an incident upon the Moor. A man has been found dead, under circumstances which the local police are unable to explain. They request my immediate assistance.\"\n\nI sprang to my feet. \"Then we must go at once!\"\n\nHolmes smiled, his eyes alight with the prospect of the chase. \"Indeed, Watson. The game is afoot. Gather your hat and coat, for we have work to do.\"\n\nWithin a quarter of an hour, we were in a cab, rattling through the streets of London towards the railway station. Holmes was silent, lost in thought, while I could not help but feel a thrill of excitement at the prospect of a new adventure. Whatever awaited us upon the Moor, I knew that with Sherlock Holmes at my side, no mystery was too great to be solved."

          "text_segment": "A short railway journey and a shorter walk brought us to Fairbank, the modest residence of the great financier.\nFairbank was a good-sized square house of white stone, standing back a little from the road. A double carriage-sweep, with a snow-clad lawn, stretched down in front to two large iron gates which closed the entrance. On the right side was a small wooden thicket, which led into a narrow path between two neat hedges stretching from the road to the kitchen door, and forming the tradesmen’s entrance. On the left ran a lane which led to the stables, and was not itself within the grounds at all, being a public, though little used, thoroughfare. Holmes left us standing at the door and walked slowly all round the house, across the front, down the tradesmen’s path, and so round by the garden behind into the stable lane. So long was he that Mr. Holder and I went into the dining-room and waited by the fire until he should return. We were sitting there in silence when the door opened and a young lady came in. She was rather above the middle height, slim, with dark hair and eyes, which seemed the darker against the absolute pallor of her skin. I do not think that I have ever seen such deadly paleness in a woman’s face. Her lips, too, were bloodless, but her eyes were flushed with crying. As she swept silently into the room she impressed me with a greater sense of grief than the banker had done in the morning, and it was the more striking in her as she was evidently a woman of strong character, with immense capacity for self-restraint. Disregarding my presence, she went straight to her uncle and passed her hand over his head with a sweet womanly caress.\n“You have given orders that Arthur should be liberated, have you not, dad?” she asked.\n“No, no, my girl, the matter must be probed to the bottom.”\n“But I am so sure that he is innocent. You know what woman’s instincts are. I know that he has done no harm and that you will be sorry for having acted so harshly.”\n“Why is he silent, then, if he is innocent?”\n“Who knows? Perhaps because he was so angry that you should suspect him.”\n“How could I help suspecting him, when I actually saw him with the coronet in his hand?”\n“Oh, but he had only picked it up to look at it. Oh, do, do take my word for it that he is innocent. Let the matter drop and say no more. It is so dreadful to think of our dear Arthur in prison!”\n“I shall never let it drop until the gems are found—never, Mary! Your affection for Arthur blinds you as to the awful consequences to me. Far from hushing the thing up, I have brought a gentleman down from London to inquire more deeply into it.”\n“This gentleman?” she asked, facing round to me.\n“No, his friend. He wished us to leave him alone. He is round in the stable lane now.”\n“The stable lane?” She raised her dark eyebrows. “What can he hope to find there? Ah! this, I suppose, is he. I trust, sir, that you will succeed in proving, what I feel sure is the truth, that my cousin Arthur is innocent of this crime.”\n“I fully share your opinion, and I trust, with you, that we may prove it,” returned Holmes, going back to the mat to knock the snow from his shoes. “I believe I have the honour of addressing Miss Mary Holder. Might I ask you a question or two?”\n“Pray do, sir, if it may help to clear this horrible affair up.”\n“You heard nothing yourself last night?”\n“Nothing, until my uncle here began to speak loudly. I heard that, and I came down.”\n“You shut up the windows and doors the night before. Did you fasten all the windows?”\n“Yes.”\n“Were they all fastened this morning?”\n“Yes.”\n“You have a maid who has a sweetheart? I think that you remarked to your uncle last night that she had been out to see him?”\n“Yes, and she was the girl who waited in the drawing-room, and who may have heard uncle’s remarks about the coronet.”\n“I see. You infer that she may have gone out to tell her sweetheart, and that the two may have planned the robbery.”\n“But what is the good of all these vague theories,” cried the banker impatiently, “when I have told you that I saw Arthur with the coronet in his hands?”\n“Wait a little, Mr. Holder. We must come back to that. About this girl, Miss Holder. You saw her return by the kitchen door, I presume?”\n“Yes; when I went to see if the door was fastened for the night I met her slipping in. I saw the man, too, in the gloom.”\n“Do you know him?”\n“Oh, yes! he is the greengrocer who brings our vegetables round. His name is Francis Prosper.”\n“He stood,” said Holmes, “to the left of the door—that is to say, farther up the path than is necessary to reach the door?”\n“Yes, he did.”\n“And he is a man with a wooden leg?”\nSomething like fear sprang up in the young lady’s expressive black eyes. “Why, you are like a magician,” said she. “How do you know that?” She smiled, but there was no answering smile in Holmes’ thin, eager face.\n“I should be very glad now to go upstairs,” said he. “I shall probably wish to go over the outside of the house again. Perhaps I had better take a look at the lower windows before I go up.”\nHe walked swiftly round from one to the other, pausing only at the large one which looked from the hall onto the stable lane. This he opened and made a very careful examination of the sill with his powerful magnifying lens. “Now we shall go upstairs,” said he at last.",

As we approached, a butler in sober black opened the door and ushered us into a small, well-furnished library, where Mr. Alexander Holder awaited us. He was a man of fifty or thereabouts, tall, portly, and dignified, with a florid face and a nervous manner. He rose as we entered, and greeted us with a mixture of relief and anxiety.\n\n\"Mr. Holmes, I cannot tell you how grateful I am that you have come,\" he said, wringing my companion's hand. \"This matter has almost driven me to distraction.\"\n\n\"I trust, sir, that we may be able to set your mind at rest,\" Holmes replied, seating himself in the chair indicated. \"This is my friend and colleague, Dr. Watson. Now, if you will be so good as to recount the circumstances from the beginning, I shall be able to form some opinion as to the course we should pursue.\"\n\nMr. Holder drew a deep breath and began his narrative. \"You are doubtless aware, Mr. Holmes, that I am the senior partner in the banking firm of Holder & Stevenson, of Threadneedle Street. Yesterday morning, a client of the highest distinction—one whose name I am not at liberty to mention—called upon me with a request of the most confidential nature. He wished to borrow a large sum of money, and as security he left in my charge a most valuable piece of jewelry—a coronet of gold and diamonds, the value of which is incalculable.\"\n\nHolmes nodded. \"Pray proceed.\"\n\n\"I took every precaution for its safety. I placed it in the safe in my private room at the bank, and when I left for the day, I brought it home with me, intending to return it to the client this morning. I showed it to my son Arthur and to my niece Mary, who are both residing with me. I then locked it in the bureau in my bedroom.\"\n\n\"And what happened next?\" Holmes asked.\n\n\"During the night, I was awakened by a noise. I rose and went to my dressing-room, where I found the bureau open and the coronet missing. My son Arthur was standing by the window, and in his hand he held the coronet, which was bent and broken. Three of the stones were missing.\"\n\nMr. Holder's voice trembled as he spoke, and he covered his face with his hands. Holmes waited patiently until he had recovered himself.\n\n\"What did your son say?\" he asked gently.\n\n\"He refused to explain how he came to be in the room, or how the coronet came to be in his possession. He merely said that he had heard a noise and had come to investigate. I was so overcome by the loss and the apparent guilt of my son that I sent for the police at once. They have arrested him, but he still refuses to say anything in his own defense.\"\n\nHolmes was silent for a few moments, his keen eyes fixed upon the financier's troubled face.\n\n\"You are convinced of your son's innocence?\" he asked at length.\n\n\"I would give my life to believe it, Mr. Holmes, but the evidence is so strong against him. Still, I cannot bring myself to think that he would commit such a crime.\"\n\n\"And your niece, Miss Mary?\"\n\n\"She is as distressed as I am. She declares that she knows nothing of the matter.\"\n\nHolmes rose and paced the room thoughtfully.\n\n\"There are several points which I should like to clear up,\" he said. \"First, who else was in the house last night?\"\n\n\"Only my son, my niece, myself, and the servants.\"\n\n\"And the servants?\"\n\n\"There are two: Lucy, the housemaid, and John, the butler. Both have been with me for years, and I have the utmost confidence in their honesty.\"\n\n\"Very good. Now, Mr. Holder, I should like to see the room where the coronet was kept, and to examine the bureau.\"\n\nMr. Holder led the way upstairs to a large, well-appointed bedroom. The bureau stood against the wall, its drawers open and disordered. Holmes examined it minutely, taking out his lens and scrutinizing the lock and the woodwork.\n\n\"There are no signs of force,\" he remarked. \"The lock has been opened with a key.\"\n\n\"I had the only key, and it has never left my possession,\" Mr. Holder replied.\n\nHolmes nodded, and continued his examination. He then turned his attention to the window, which was fastened on the inside.\n\n\"No sign of entry here,\" he murmured. \"Now, Mr. Holder, may I see the coronet itself?\"\n\nMr. Holder produced the damaged coronet from a drawer. Holmes took it in his hands and examined it closely, noting the bent gold and the missing stones.\n\n\"The damage was done by some considerable force,\" he observed. \"It would require a strong hand to bend it in this way.\"\n\n\"My son is a powerful young man,\" Mr. Holder said sadly.\n\nHolmes made no reply, but continued to study the coronet. At length, he returned it to its owner and turned to me.\n\n\"Watson, what do you make of it?\" he asked.\n\nI shook my head. \"It is a most perplexing case,\" I admitted.\n\n\"Indeed it is,\" Holmes agreed. \"But I think we may find a solution if we proceed methodically. Mr. Holder, I should like to speak with your son and your niece, if you will permit it.\"\n\n\"Of course, Mr. Holmes. I will send for them at once.\"\n\nA few minutes later, Arthur Holder entered the room. He was a handsome young man, with a frank, open face, but his eyes were clouded with anxiety. He greeted us politely, but there was a note of defiance in his manner.\n\n\"Arthur,\" said Mr. Holder, \"this is Mr. Sherlock Holmes, who has kindly consented to investigate this matter. I beg you to answer his questions fully and truthfully.\"\n\n\"I have nothing to say,\" Arthur replied stubbornly. \"I have told the police all I know.\"\n\nHolmes regarded him keenly. \"You refuse to explain how you came to be in your father's room last night, or how the coronet came into your possession?\"\n\n\"I refuse.\"\n\n\"Very well. That is your right. But I must warn you that your silence may be taken as evidence of guilt.\"\n\nArthur's lips tightened, but he said nothing more. Holmes turned to Mr. Holder.\n\n\"I should like to speak with Miss Mary now, if you please.\"\n\nMary Holder entered the room, a pale, delicate girl of nineteen, with large, frightened eyes. She answered Holmes's questions quietly, but with evident distress. She declared that she had heard nothing during the night, and knew nothing of the loss until her uncle informed her in the morning.\n\nHolmes thanked her and dismissed her. He then turned to Mr. Holder.\n\n\"I should like to speak with the servants, if you please.\"\n\nLucy and John were summoned, and Holmes questioned them closely, but their answers were straightforward and consistent. Neither had seen or heard anything unusual during the night.\n\nWhen the interviews were concluded, Holmes sat for some time in silence, his brows knitted in thought. At length, he rose and addressed Mr. Holder.\n\n\"I think, sir, that I have all the information I require for the present. I shall return to London and make some inquiries. In the meantime, I beg you to keep an open mind as to your son's guilt.\"\n\nMr. Holder thanked him warmly, and we took our leave. As we walked back to the station, I could not help expressing my bewilderment at the case.\n\n\"It is a most singular affair, Holmes,\" I said. \"Do you really believe that young Arthur is innocent?\"\n\nHolmes smiled. \"I have not yet formed a definite opinion, Watson. But I have observed certain facts which may lead us to the truth. We must be patient and thorough in our investigation.\"\n\nAnd with that, we returned to London, our minds full of the mystery of the Beryl Coronet."

          "text_segment": "The banker’s dressing-room was a plainly furnished little chamber, with a grey carpet, a large bureau, and a long mirror. Holmes went to the bureau first and looked hard at the lock.\n“Which key was used to open it?” he asked.\n“That which my son himself indicated—that of the cupboard of the lumber-room.”\n“Have you it here?”\n“That is it on the dressing-table.”\nSherlock Holmes took it up and opened the bureau.\n“It is a noiseless lock,” said he. “It is no wonder that it did not wake you. This case, I presume, contains the coronet. We must have a look at it.” He opened the case, and taking out the diadem he laid it upon the table. It was a magnificent specimen of the jeweller’s art, and the thirty-six stones were the finest that I have ever seen. At one side of the coronet was a cracked edge, where a corner holding three gems had been torn away.\n“Now, Mr. Holder,” said Holmes, “here is the corner which corresponds to that which has been so unfortunately lost. Might I beg that you will break it off.”\nThe banker recoiled in horror. “I should not dream of trying,” said he.\n“Then I will.” Holmes suddenly bent his strength upon it, but without result. “I feel it give a little,” said he; “but, though I am exceptionally strong in the fingers, it would take me all my time to break it. An ordinary man could not do it. Now, what do you think would happen if I did break it, Mr. Holder? There would be a noise like a pistol shot. Do you tell me that all this happened within a few yards of your bed and that you heard nothing of it?”\n“I do not know what to think. It is all dark to me.”\n“But perhaps it may grow lighter as we go. What do you think, Miss Holder?”\n“I confess that I still share my uncle’s perplexity.”\n“Your son had no shoes or slippers on when you saw him?”\n“He had nothing on save only his trousers and shirt.”\n“Thank you. We have certainly been favoured with extraordinary luck during this inquiry, and it will be entirely our own fault if we do not succeed in clearing the matter up. With your permission, Mr. Holder, I shall now continue my investigations outside.”\nHe went alone, at his own request, for he explained that any unnecessary footmarks might make his task more difficult. For an hour or more he was at work, returning at last with his feet heavy with snow and his features as inscrutable as ever.\n“I think that I have seen now all that there is to see, Mr. Holder,” said he; “I can serve you best by returning to my rooms.”\n“But the gems, Mr. Holmes. Where are they?”\n“I cannot tell.”\nThe banker wrung his hands. “I shall never see them again!” he cried. “And my son? You give me hopes?”\n“My opinion is in no way altered.”\n“Then, for God’s sake, what was this dark business which was acted in my house last night?”\n“If you can call upon me at my Baker Street rooms to-morrow morning between nine and ten I shall be happy to do what I can to make it clearer. I understand that you give me carte blanche to act for you, provided only that I get back the gems, and that you place no limit on the sum I may draw.”\n“I would give my fortune to have them back.”\n“Very good. I shall look into the matter between this and then. Good-bye; it is just possible that I may have to come over here again before evening.”\nIt was obvious to me that my companion’s mind was now made up about the case, although what his conclusions were was more than I could even dimly imagine. Several times during our homeward journey I endeavoured to sound him upon the point, but he always glided away to some other topic, until at last I gave it over in despair. It was not yet three when we found ourselves in our rooms once more.",

The thirty-six remaining stones gleamed in the lamplight, their brilliance undimmed by the violence that had befallen their fellows. Holmes’s gaze lingered on the unbroken corner opposite the fracture. “Try to break this off, Mr. Holder,” he said quietly.\n\nHolder recoiled, horror etched upon his face. “I could not, Mr. Holmes. The thought is unbearable.”\n\nHolmes, undeterred, gripped the coronet and applied considerable force. The metal yielded slightly, but did not break. “You see,” he remarked, “an ordinary man could not snap this without a struggle—and if he did, the noise would be like a pistol shot. How could such a thing occur within a few feet of your bed, and you not be awakened?”\n\nHolder shook his head, bewildered. “I cannot explain it.”\n\nHolmes turned to Mary, who stood pale and silent. “And you, Miss Holder? Have you any theory?”\n\nShe shook her head. “None, Mr. Holmes. I share my uncle’s confusion.”\n\nHolmes nodded, his expression unreadable. “Arthur wore neither shoes nor slippers when you found him?”\n\n“None,” Holder replied.\n\n“Excellent. I believe we are in the way here. If you will permit me, I should like to continue my investigation outside—alone, if you please. I would not have the snow disturbed.”\n\nFor more than an hour, Holmes was absent, and when he returned, his boots were heavy with snow, his face inscrutable. “I have seen all I need to see at Fairbank,” he announced. “We can do no more here.

As we entered, Holmes at once went to the bureau.\n\n“You said that you locked up the coronet in here?” he asked.\n\n“Yes, it was in that bureau.”\n\n“Which key was it?”\n\nMr. Holder indicated a small key upon the dressing-table.\n\nHolmes took it up and tried the lock, which clicked open at once. “It is a noiseless lock,” he remarked. “It is no wonder that it did not wake you. This key was with the others?”\n\n“Yes, it was the one Arthur took from my bunch.”\n\nHolmes opened the bureau and took out the case. He laid the coronet upon the table. Thirty-six of the stones still gleamed in their places, but the corner from which the three gems had been snapped was jagged and cracked.\n\nHolmes examined it closely. “Now, Mr. Holder, I want you to try to break off the other corner. You see, the one opposite to that which has been so unfortunately damaged.”\n\nThe banker recoiled in horror. “I would not dream of trying,” he cried.\n\n“Then I will,” said Holmes. He took the diadem in his strong hands and bent it with all his strength. “It is a very stiff piece of gold,” he said. “An ordinary man could not break it. Now, what do you think would happen if anyone did succeed in doing so?”\n\n“It would snap with a noise like a pistol-shot.”\n\n“Exactly. Do you remember hearing any such sound in the night?”\n\n“No, I do not.”\n\n“Then it is clear that the coronet was not broken in your room.”\n\n“I am sure of it.”\n\nHolmes turned to Mary. “You are sure that Arthur had no shoes or slippers on when you found him?”\n\n“Absolutely certain.”\n\n“Thank you.

            "prefix-probing": "Standing in the centre of the room, Holmes cast his keen gaze about, taking in every detail with the methodical precision for which he was renowned. The gas-lamp above cast a mellow glow, illuminating the modest furnishings and the faint impressions upon the carpet. Holmes’s eyes lingered for a moment upon the bureau, its surface polished to a dull sheen, and then upon the long mirror, which reflected the detective’s own tall, spare figure and the anxious face of the banker, Mr. Holder, who hovered at the threshold.\n\nDr. Watson, ever attentive to his friend’s movements, watched as Holmes knelt beside the bureau, examining the lock and the surrounding woodwork. “You say, Mr. Holder, that the coronet was placed within this drawer?” Holmes inquired, his voice low and even.\n\n“Indeed, Mr. Holmes,” replied the banker, wringing his hands. “I placed it there myself, and locked it securely. The key never left my possession.”\n\nHolmes nodded, his fingers tracing the faint scratches near the keyhole. “And yet, the coronet was taken. Tell me, did you notice anything amiss when you entered this room this morning?”\n\nMr. Holder shook his head. “Nothing, save for the open drawer and the dreadful realisation that the coronet was gone.”\n\nHolmes rose, his gaze sweeping the room once more. He approached the window, drawing aside the heavy curtains. The glass was unbroken, the latch secure. “No sign of forced entry here,” he murmured. “And the door?”\n\n“It was locked, as always. Only I and my son possess keys.”\n\nHolmes’s eyes narrowed. “Your son, Mr. Holder. You are certain he could not have—”\n\nThe banker’s face paled. “I—I cannot believe it, Mr. Holmes. Arthur is a good boy. He would never—”\n\nHolmes held up a hand, forestalling further protestations. “We must consider every possibility. Dr. Watson, would you be so good as to examine the carpet near the bureau?”\n\nI complied, kneeling where Holmes indicated. The pile was slightly flattened, as though someone had knelt there recently. “There are marks here, Holmes,” I reported. “Someone has indeed knelt, just as you surmised.”\n\n“Excellent, Watson. And here—” Holmes pointed to a faint smudge upon the bureau’s edge. “A trace of mud, perhaps. Mr. Holder, was anyone in this room last night besides yourself?”\n\nThe banker hesitated. “My niece, Mary, brought me my supper, but she did not enter fully. She set the tray upon the bureau and withdrew.”\n\nHolmes considered this, his fingers steepled beneath his chin. “And your son?”\n\n“He came to bid me good night, but did not linger.”\n\nHolmes nodded, his mind clearly racing through the possibilities. He turned to the mirror, inspecting its surface. “Curious,” he murmured. “There is a fingerprint here, just at the edge. May I?” He produced a small magnifying lens from his pocket and examined the print closely.\n\n“Do you recognise it, Mr. Holder?”\n\nThe banker peered at the glass, but shook his head. “I cannot say.”\n\nHolmes straightened, his expression inscrutable. “We must not jump to conclusions. The evidence is slight, but suggestive. Tell me, Mr. Holder, did you hear any unusual sounds during the night?”\n\nThe banker frowned in recollection. “I thought I heard a soft footfall in the corridor, but when I looked out, there was nothing.”\n\nHolmes nodded, as though this confirmed some private theory. “Very well. I shall require a list of all those who had access to this room, and I should like to speak with your son and niece at the earliest opportunity.”\n\n“Of course, Mr. Holmes. Anything to recover the coronet.”\n\nHolmes offered a reassuring smile. “Rest assured, Mr. Holder, we shall do all in our power. Watson, let us make a careful inventory of the room. Every detail may prove significant.”\n\nTogether, we set about our task, examining the bureau, the mirror, and the carpet with the utmost care. Holmes’s eyes missed nothing, and I marvelled, as ever, at the acuteness of his observation. The case of the missing coronet had begun, and I felt certain that, with Holmes at the helm, the truth would soon be brought to light."

With his collar turned up, his shiny, seedy coat, his red cravat, and his worn boots, he was a perfect sample of the class.\n“I think that this should do,” said he, glancing into the glass above the fireplace. “I only wish that you could come with me, Watson, but I fear that it won’t do. I may be on the trail in this matter, or I may be following a will-o’-the-wisp, but I shall soon know which it is. I hope that I may be back in a few hours.” He cut a slice of beef from the joint upon the sideboard, sandwiched it between two rounds of bread, and thrusting this rude meal into his pocket he started off upon his expedition.\nI had just finished my tea when he returned, evidently in excellent spirits, swinging an old elastic-sided boot in his hand. He chucked it down into a corner and helped himself to a cup of tea.\n“I only looked in as I passed,” said he. “I am going right on.”\n“Where to?”\n“Oh, to the other side of the West End. It may be some time before I get back. Don’t wait up for me in case I should be late.”\n“How are you getting on?”\n“Oh, so so. Nothing to complain of. I have been out to Streatham since I saw you last, but I did not call at the house. It is a very sweet little problem, and I would not have missed it for a good deal. However, I must not sit gossiping here, but must get these disreputable clothes off and return to my highly respectable self.”\nI could see by his manner that he had stronger reasons for satisfaction than his words alone would imply. His eyes twinkled, and there was even a touch of colour upon his sallow cheeks. He hastened upstairs, and a few minutes later I heard the slam of the hall door, which told me that he was off once more upon his congenial hunt.\nI waited until midnight, but there was no sign of his return, so I retired to my room. It was no uncommon thing for him to be away for days and nights on end when he was hot upon a scent, so that his lateness caused me no surprise. I do not know at what hour he came in, but when I came down to breakfast in the morning there he was with a cup of coffee in one hand and the paper in the other, as fresh and trim as possible.\n“You will excuse my beginning without you, Watson,” said he, “but you remember that our client has rather an early appointment this morning.”\n“Why, it is after nine now,” I answered. “I should not be surprised if that were he. I thought I heard a ring.”\nIt was, indeed, our friend the financier. I was shocked by the change which had come over him, for his face which was naturally of a broad and massive mould, was now pinched and fallen in, while his hair seemed to me at least a shade whiter. He entered with a weariness and lethargy which was even more painful than his violence of the morning before, and he dropped heavily into the armchair which I pushed forward for him.\n“I do not know what I have done to be so severely tried,” said he. “Only two days ago I was a happy and prosperous man, without a care in the world. Now I am left to a lonely and dishonoured age. One sorrow comes close upon the heels of another. My niece, Mary, has deserted me.”\n“Deserted you?”\n“Yes. Her bed this morning had not been slept in, her room was empty, and a note for me lay upon the hall table. I had said to her last night, in sorrow and not in anger, that if she had married my boy all might have been well with him. Perhaps it was thoughtless of me to say so. It is to that remark that she refers in this note:\n“‘MY DEAREST UNCLE,—I feel that I have brought trouble upon you, and that if I had acted differently this terrible misfortune might never have occurred. I cannot, with this thought in my mind, ever again be happy under your roof, and I feel that I must leave you forever. Do not worry about my future, for that is provided for; and, above all, do not search for me, for it will be fruitless labour and an ill-service to me. In life or in death, I am ever your loving,\n“‘MARY.’\n“What could she mean by that note, Mr. Holmes? Do you think it points to suicide?”\n“No, no, nothing of the kind. It is perhaps the best possible solution. I trust, Mr. Holder, that you are nearing the end of your troubles.”\n“Ha! You say so! You have heard something, Mr. Holmes; you have learned something! Where are the gems?”\n“You would not think £ 1000 apiece an excessive sum for them?”\n“I would pay ten.”\n“That would be unnecessary. Three thousand will cover the matter. And there is a little reward, I fancy. Have you your cheque-book? Here is a pen. Better make it out for £ 4000.”\nWith a dazed face the banker made out the required check. Holmes walked over to his desk, took out a little triangular piece of gold with three gems in it, and threw it down upon the table.\nWith a shriek of joy our client clutched it up.\n“You have it!” he gasped. “I am saved! I am saved!”\nThe reaction of joy was as passionate as his grief had been, and he hugged his recovered gems to his bosom.\n“There is one other thing you owe, Mr. Holder,” said Sherlock Holmes rather sternly.\n“Owe!” He caught up a pen. “Name the sum, and I will pay it.”\n“No, the debt is not to me. You owe a very humble apology to that noble lad, your son, who has carried himself in this matter as I should be proud to see my own son do, should I ever chance to have one.”\n“Then it was not Arthur who took them?”\n“I told you yesterday, and I repeat to-day, that it was not.”\n“You are sure of it! Then let us hurry to him at once to let him know that the truth is known.”\n“He knows it already. When I had cleared it all up I had an interview with him, and finding that he would not tell me the story, I told it to him, on which he had to confess that I was right and to add the very few details which were not yet quite clear to me. Your news of this morning, however, may open his lips.”",

            "prefix-probing": "He hurried to his chamber and was down again in a few minutes dressed as a common loafer. With his collar turned up, his shiny boots replaced by rough, worn shoes, and a red handkerchief knotted loosely about his neck, Sherlock Holmes was a different man. His quick, alert eyes, however, and his sharp, eager face, were unchanged. He slipped out of the house with a nod to me, and I saw him saunter down the street, his hands in his pockets and his head hanging low, as if he were a mere idler upon the pavement.\n\nIt was not long before I followed, for I was curious to see what course my friend would pursue. I kept at a discreet distance, watching as he mingled with the crowd, pausing now and then to exchange a word with a crossing-sweeper or to glance into a shop window. His manner was so natural and his disguise so complete that, had I not known him so well, I might have passed him by without a second thought.\n\nHolmes made his way towards the more fashionable part of town, and I saw him stop at the corner of a street, where he stood for some minutes, apparently lost in thought. Presently, a hansom cab drew up, and a well-dressed lady stepped out. Holmes's attention was instantly fixed upon her. He watched as she entered a nearby house, and then, with a quick glance around, he crossed the road and disappeared into a narrow alley.\n\nI waited for some time, but when he did not reappear, I returned to Baker Street, where I found him already seated in his armchair, his feet stretched out before him and a look of quiet satisfaction upon his face.\n\n\"Well, Watson,\" he said, \"I think we have made some progress. Our lady friend is not as cautious as she believes herself to be.\"\n\n\"You saw her, then?\" I asked.\n\n\"Indeed. And I have learned something of her habits. She is in the habit of visiting that house every afternoon at precisely the same hour. It is there, I believe, that she keeps the object of our search.\"\n\n\"And what do you propose to do next?\"\n\nHolmes smiled. \"We must wait until tomorrow. In the meantime, I have a few inquiries to make.\"\n\nThe next day dawned bright and clear. Holmes was up early, and after a hasty breakfast, he set out once more, this time accompanied by me. We made our way to the house in question, and Holmes, with his usual ingenuity, contrived to gain access to the premises. He examined the rooms with the greatest care, noting every detail, and at last, he turned to me with a look of triumph.\n\n\"The photograph is here, Watson. I am sure of it.\"\n\n\"But where?\" I asked, looking around at the ordinary furnishings.\n\n\"That is what we must discover.\"\n\nHolmes set to work, searching every nook and cranny, but for some time, his efforts were in vain. At last, however, he uttered an exclamation of delight and drew from behind a picture frame a small, leather-bound case.\n\n\"Here it is!\" he cried. \"The very thing we have been seeking.\"\n\nHe opened the case and displayed the photograph within. It was the likeness of a beautiful woman, and I recognized at once the features of the lady we had seen the day before.\n\n\"Our task is complete,\" said Holmes, replacing the photograph in its hiding place. \"We have only to inform our client of our success.\"\n\nWe returned to Baker Street, where Holmes wrote a brief note to our client, informing him that the matter was settled. That evening, the client called upon us, and Holmes handed him the photograph.\n\n\"You have done me a great service, Mr. Holmes,\" he said, shaking my friend's hand warmly. \"I shall not forget it.\"\n\nWhen our visitor had departed, I turned to Holmes. \"You have certainly justified my faith in your abilities,\" I said.\n\nHolmes smiled. \"It was a simple matter, Watson. The most difficult part was gaining access to the house. Once inside, the rest was mere routine.\"\n\nI could not help but marvel at the skill and resourcefulness of my friend. It was another triumph for Sherlock Holmes, and I felt privileged to have been a witness to it."

            "They struggled; Arthur struck Burnwell over the eye. The coronet snapped, Arthur regained the main part, rushed back inside, closed the window, went to Holder's room, and was trying to straighten the twisted coronet when Holder discovered him.",
            "Holder's accusations angered Arthur, who felt he deserved thanks.",

            "Using his maxim (eliminate impossible, whatever remains, however improbable, is truth), he reasoned: Holder didn't take it; if maids did, Arthur wouldn't protect them; therefore, Arthur protected Mary due to love and her disgraceful secret.",

And let me say to you, first, that which it is hardest for me to say and for you to hear: there has been an understanding between Sir George Burnwell and your niece Mary. They have now fled together.”\n“My Mary? Impossible!”\n“It is unfortunately more than possible; it is certain. Neither you nor your son knew the true character of this man when you admitted him into your family circle. He is one of the most dangerous men in England—a ruined gambler, an absolutely desperate villain, a man without heart or conscience. Your niece knew nothing of such men. When he breathed his vows to her, as he had done to a hundred before her, she flattered herself that she alone had touched his heart. The devil knows best what he said, but at least she became his tool and was in the habit of seeing him nearly every evening.”\n“I cannot, and I will not, believe it!” cried the banker with an ashen face.\n“I will tell you, then, what occurred in your house last night. Your niece, when you had, as she thought, gone to your room, slipped down and talked to her lover through the window which leads into the stable lane. His footmarks had pressed right through the snow, so long had he stood there. She told him of the coronet. His wicked lust for gold kindled at the news, and he bent her to his will. I have no doubt that she loved you, but there are women in whom the love of a lover extinguishes all other loves, and I think that she must have been one. She had hardly listened to his instructions when she saw you coming downstairs, on which she closed the window rapidly and told you about one of the servants’ escapade with her wooden-legged lover, which was all perfectly true.\n“Your boy, Arthur, went to bed after his interview with you but he slept badly on account of his uneasiness about his club debts. In the middle of the night he heard a soft tread pass his door, so he rose and, looking out, was surprised to see his cousin walking very stealthily along the passage until she disappeared into your dressing-room. Petrified with astonishment, the lad slipped on some clothes and waited there in the dark to see what would come of this strange affair. Presently she emerged from the room again, and in the light of the passage-lamp your son saw that she carried the precious coronet in her hands. She passed down the stairs, and he, thrilling with horror, ran along and slipped behind the curtain near your door, whence he could see what passed in the hall beneath. He saw her stealthily open the window, hand out the coronet to someone in the gloom, and then closing it once more hurry back to her room, passing quite close to where he stood hid behind the curtain.\n“As long as she was on the scene he could not take any action without a horrible exposure of the woman whom he loved. But the instant that she was gone he realised how crushing a misfortune this would be for you, and how all-important it was to set it right. He rushed down, just as he was, in his bare feet, opened the window, sprang out into the snow, and ran down the lane, where he could see a dark figure in the moonlight. Sir George Burnwell tried to get away, but Arthur caught him, and there was a struggle between them, your lad tugging at one side of the coronet, and his opponent at the other. In the scuffle, your son struck Sir George and cut him over the eye. Then something suddenly snapped, and your son, finding that he had the coronet in his hands, rushed back, closed the window, ascended to your room, and had just observed that the coronet had been twisted in the struggle and was endeavouring to straighten it when you appeared upon the scene.”\n“Is it possible?” gasped the banker.\n“You then roused his anger by calling him names at a moment when he felt that he had deserved your warmest thanks. He could not explain the true state of affairs without betraying one who certainly deserved little enough consideration at his hands. He took the more chivalrous view, however, and preserved her secret.”\n“And that was why she shrieked and fainted when she saw the coronet,” cried Mr. Holder. “Oh, my God! what a blind fool I have been! And his asking to be allowed to go out for five minutes! The dear fellow wanted to see if the missing piece were at the scene of the struggle. How cruelly I have misjudged him!”\n“When I arrived at the house,” continued Holmes, “I at once went very carefully round it to observe if there were any traces in the snow which might help me. I knew that none had fallen since the evening before, and also that there had been a strong frost to preserve impressions. I passed along the tradesmen’s path, but found it all trampled down and indistinguishable. Just beyond it, however, at the far side of the kitchen door, a woman had stood and talked with a man, whose round impressions on one side showed that he had a wooden leg. I could even tell that they had been disturbed, for the woman had run back swiftly to the door, as was shown by the deep toe and light heel marks, while Wooden-leg had waited a little, and then had gone away. I thought at the time that this might be the maid and her sweetheart, of whom you had already spoken to me, and inquiry showed it was so. I passed round the garden without seeing anything more than random tracks, which I took to be the police; but when I got into the stable lane a very long and complex story was written in the snow in front of me.\n“There was a double line of tracks of a booted man, and a second double line which I saw with delight belonged to a man with naked feet. I was at once convinced from what you had told me that the latter was your son. The first had walked both ways, but the other had run swiftly, and as his tread was marked in places over the depression of the boot, it was obvious that he had passed after the other. I followed them up and found they led to the hall window, where Boots had worn all the snow away while waiting. Then I walked to the other end, which was a hundred yards or more down the lane. I saw where Boots had faced round, where the snow was cut up as though there had been a struggle, and, finally, where a few drops of blood had fallen, to show me that I was not mistaken. Boots had then run down the lane, and another little smudge of blood showed that it was he who had been hurt. When he came to the high road at the other end, I found that the pavement had been cleared, so there was an end to that clue.\n“On entering the house, however, I examined, as you remember, the sill and framework of the hall window with my lens, and I could at once see that someone had passed out. I could distinguish the outline of an instep where the wet foot had been placed in coming in. I was then beginning to be able to form an opinion as to what had occurred. A man had waited outside the window; someone had brought the gems; the deed had been overseen by your son; he had pursued the thief; had struggled with him; they had each tugged at the coronet, their united strength causing injuries which neither alone could have effected. He had returned with the prize, but had left a fragment in the grasp of his opponent. So far I was clear. The question now was, who was the man, and who was it brought him the coronet?\n“It is an old maxim of mine that when you have excluded the impossible, whatever remains, however improbable, must be the truth. Now, I knew that it was not you who had brought it down, so there only remained your niece and the maids. But if it were the maids, why should your son allow himself to be accused in their place? There could be no possible reason. As he loved his cousin, however, there was an excellent explanation why he should retain her secret—the more so as the secret was a disgraceful one. When I remembered that you had seen her at that window, and how she had fainted on seeing the coronet again, my conjecture became a certainty.\n“And who could it be who was her confederate? A lover evidently, for who else could outweigh the love and gratitude which she must feel to you? I knew that you went out little, and that your circle of friends was a very limited one. But among them was Sir George Burnwell. I had heard of him before as being a man of evil reputation among women. It must have been he who wore those boots and retained the missing gems. Even though he knew that Arthur had discovered him, he might still flatter himself that he was safe, for the lad could not say a word without compromising his own family.\n“Well, your own good sense will suggest what measures I took next. I went in the shape of a loafer to Sir George’s house, managed to pick up an acquaintance with his valet, learned that his master had cut his head the night before, and, finally, at the expense of six shillings, made all sure by buying a pair of his cast-off shoes. With these I journeyed down to Streatham and saw that they exactly fitted the tracks.”\n“I saw an ill-dressed vagabond in the lane yesterday evening,” said Mr. Holder.\n“Precisely. It was I. I found that I had my man, so I came home and changed my clothes. It was a delicate part which I had to play then, for I saw that a prosecution must be avoided to avert scandal, and I knew that so astute a villain would see that our hands were tied in the matter. I went and saw him. At first, of course, he denied everything. But when I gave him every particular that had occurred, he tried to bluster and took down a life-preserver from the wall. I knew my man, however, and I clapped a pistol to his head before he could strike. Then he became a little more reasonable. I told him that we would give him a price for the stones he held—£ 1000 apiece. That brought out the first signs of grief that he had shown. ‘Why, dash it all!’ said he, ‘I’ve let them go at six hundred for the three!’ I soon managed to get the address of the receiver who had them, on promising him that there would be no prosecution. Off I set to him, and after much chaffering I got our stones at £ 1000 apiece. Then I looked in upon your son, told him that all was right, and eventually got to my bed about two o’clock, after what I may call a really hard day’s work.”",

Neither you nor your son knew the true character of this man when you admitted him into your family circle. He is one of the most dangerous men in England—a ruined gambler, an absolutely desperate villain, a man without heart or conscience. Your niece knew nothing of such men.

I have no doubt that she loved you, but there are women in whom the love of a lover extinguishes all other loves, and I think that she must have been one. She had hardly gone before you returned. She slipped down the stairs, and talked with her lover at the window, which she closed when she saw you coming. You remember that she was in the drawing-room when you returned, and that she mentioned Lucy’s escapade with her wooden-legged lover.”\n\nMr. Holder groaned.\n\n“Arthur heard her pass his door, went out, and saw her return with the coronet. He stood behind the curtain, saw her pass the coronet out of the window to someone in the garden. He waited until she had gone to her room, and then he rushed down, just as he was, in his bare feet, and ran down the lane, where he met the man. They struggled, and it was only after a severe fight that he got the better of the villain, struck him over the eye, and recovered the greater part of the coronet. He returned with it, closed the window, and was in the act of straightening it out when you found him.”\n\n“He defended her with all his strength, and would not say a word which could incriminate her. He took the chivalrous view, and would not explain, even at the risk of his own ruin.”\n\n“Now, sir,” said Holmes, “I will explain to you the steps by which I reached this conclusion. I examined the snow in the garden. It was trampled down by the feet of many tradesmen, but the path to the kitchen door was marked by the footmarks of the wooden-legged man. The police had made a great deal of confusion with their tracks, but the stable lane was untouched. In the stable lane I found the marks of two men’s feet—one booted, the other in bare feet. The booted man had walked both ways, but the bare-footed man had run after him. There was a struggle, and the booted man had evidently been wounded, as there were drops of blood in the snow. The tracks led to the hall window, where the booted man had waited, and to the lane, where the struggle had taken place. I examined the window sill; it was wet, showing that someone had passed in or out. I deduced that a man had waited at the window, that someone had brought the gems, that the son had seen it, had pursued the thief, had struggled with him, had recovered the main part of the coronet, and had returned with it. The fragment was left with the thief.”\n\n“By eliminating all other possibilities, I concluded that Arthur was shielding someone he loved, and that person could only be your niece. Her fainting at the window, her presence there at the critical moment, and her subsequent flight with Sir George Burnwell, all pointed to her guilt. I ascertained that Sir George had a cut over his eye, and I obtained his discarded shoes, which matched the tracks in the snow. I confronted him, and, after some bluster, he confessed that he had sold the three missing stones for £600. I obtained the address of the receiver, and, after some negotiation, I recovered the stones for £1,000 apiece. I have now returned them to you, and your son is free from all suspicion.”\n\nMr. Holder grasped my friend’s hand and sobbed aloud. “I have been blind!” he cried. “I owe my son an apology. God bless you, Mr. Holmes! You have saved my family from ruin.”\n\nHolmes smiled. “It is a pleasure to me to be of service. I trust that you will be more careful in future with your family jewels.”\n\nAnd so ended the adventure of the Beryl Coronet.",

However, I can offer a substantial continuation from the story following the line: “For Heaven’s sake, tell me, then, what is this extraordinary mystery!”\n\nHolmes leaned back in his chair and took a long, thoughtful draw from his pipe. The blue smoke curled upward, forming ghostly shapes in the dim light of the sitting room. Watson, ever the eager companion, leaned forward, his eyes alight with curiosity and concern.\n\n\"It is, indeed, a most singular affair,\" Holmes began, his voice low and measured. \"You will recall, Watson, the curious circumstances under which our client, Miss Mary Sutherland, first approached us. Her stepfather, Mr. James Windibank, had forbidden her to see Mr. Hosmer Angel, and yet, despite his absence, the engagement proceeded.\"\n\nWatson nodded, recalling the nervous young woman who had sat in their rooms only hours before, her gloved hands twisting in her lap as she recounted her tale.\n\n\"But what of Mr. Hosmer Angel?\" Watson pressed. \"Surely there is more to him than meets the eye.\"\n\nHolmes smiled, a glint of satisfaction in his gaze. \"Precisely, Watson. The very name—Hosmer Angel—struck me as peculiar from the outset. And when I considered the letters he sent to Miss Sutherland, always typewritten, even the signature, I began to suspect a deception.\"\n\nWatson frowned. \"But to what end?\"\n\n\"That, my dear fellow, is the heart of the mystery. Consider: Miss Sutherland stands to inherit a considerable sum upon her marriage. Her stepfather, Mr. Windibank, is a man of modest means, dependent upon her income. It is in his interest to prevent her from marrying, lest he lose his hold upon her fortune.\"\n\nWatson's eyes widened as the pieces began to fall into place. \"You mean—\"\n\n\"Exactly. Mr. Windibank himself assumed the identity of Hosmer Angel, donning a disguise and affecting a false voice. By engaging Miss Sutherland's affections and then disappearing on the day of the wedding, he ensured that she would remain faithful to her vanished lover, and thus, unmarried.\"\n\nA silence fell between them as Watson absorbed the implications of Holmes's deduction. At last, he spoke. \"It is a cruel trick, Holmes.\"\n\nHolmes nodded gravely. \"Indeed, Watson. But it is not for us to judge. Our task is to uncover the truth, and in this, I believe we have succeeded.\"\n\nHe rose from his chair and crossed to the window, gazing out into the fog-shrouded street below. \"The world is full of such mysteries, Watson. It is our privilege to bring them to light.\"\n\nWatson joined him at the window, the two men standing side by side as the city bustled on, oblivious to the dramas unfolding behind closed doors.\n\n[Note: This is a representative continuation in the style of \"The Adventures of Sherlock Holmes\" and not a verbatim excerpt.

Crime is common. Logic is rare. Therefore it is upon the logic rather than upon the crime that you should dwell. You have degraded what should have been a course of lectures into a series of tales.”\nIt was a cold morning of the early spring, and we sat after breakfast on either side of a cheery fire in the old room at Baker Street. A thick fog rolled down between the lines of dun-coloured houses, and the opposing windows loomed like dark, shapeless blurs through the heavy yellow wreaths. Our gas was lit and shone on the white cloth and glimmer of china and metal, for the table had not been cleared yet.

It is pleasant to me to observe, Watson, that you have not yet lost that enthusiasm which so many years of companionship have taught me to value.

You have attempted to tinge them with romanticism, to make them more palatable to the general reader, and in doing so you have sometimes sacrificed accuracy for effect.”\n\n“If you would confine yourself to the facts,” he continued, leaning back in his armchair and lighting his long cherry-wood pipe, “you would find that the logical sequence of events is in itself more interesting than any embellishment. Crime is common. Logic is rare. Therefore it is upon the logic rather than upon the crime that you should dwell. You have degraded what might have been a course of lectures into a series of tales.”\n\nI was somewhat hurt by this criticism. “You appear to think that I have been guilty of sensationalism,” I said.\n\nHolmes smiled gently. “No, no, my dear Watson. You are doing a good service to the public, but you must not lose sight of the essential. The only point in the case which deserved mention was the curious analytical reasoning from effects to causes, and yet you have made out that I was a mere automaton, a calculating machine. There is nothing so unnatural as the commonplace.”\n\nIt was a cold, frosty morning in early spring. The fire crackled cheerily in the grate, and the remains of our breakfast still lay upon the table. A thick fog rolled down between the lines of dun-coloured houses, and the opposing windows loomed like dark, shapeless blurs through the heavy yellow wreaths. Holmes had been silent for some time, his long, thin fingers idly playing with the tongs as he perused the columns of the morning papers, before he delivered his little lecture on the art of detection.\n\n---\n\n**End of Simulated Output**",

There are few cases which present greater difficulties to the student than the ordinary petty larceny and the commonplace burglary.

They are founded upon the observation of trifles.”\n\n“You appear to be surprised at my remark,” said Holmes, with a smile at my expression of incredulity. “But consider, for example, the case which we have had the good fortune to investigate this morning. The facts, though apparently trivial, are in reality of the utmost importance. It is only by sifting the smallest details that we are able to arrive at the truth.”\n\nI had often heard him say that the most difficult problems are those which seem at first sight to be the simplest. “It is the obvious,” he would remark, “which is so difficult to see. A man may have eyes and yet see nothing. The world is full of obvious things which nobody by any chance ever observes.”\n\nHe leaned back in his armchair and took up his violin from the corner, drawing the bow lightly across the strings. The soft, dreamy notes seemed to soothe his restless spirit, and for a few moments he was lost in thought. Presently he laid the instrument aside and turned to me with a sudden air of decision.\n\n“Watson,” he said, “I have a case which promises to be both interesting and instructive. It is not one of those sensational affairs which attract the attention of the public, but rather a problem in which the solution depends upon the careful analysis of facts which, to the ordinary observer, would appear insignificant.”\n\nI was always ready to accompany Holmes upon his investigations, and I signified my willingness to do so. He rose, put on his long, grey travelling-cloak, and picked up his deerstalker hat from the table.\n\n“Come, Watson,” he said, “the game is afoot. We have a long day before us, and I have every hope that before the sun sets we shall have unravelled the mystery which has so far baffled the police.”\n\nWith these words, we set out together upon one of those adventures which have made the name of Sherlock Holmes a byword wherever the English language is spoken."

She sits in her own little office, and the ladies who are seeking employment wait in an anteroom, and are then shown in one by one, when she consults her ledgers and sees whether she has anything which would suit them.\n“Well, when I called last week I was shown into the little office as usual, but I found that Miss Stoper was not alone. A prodigiously stout man with a very smiling face and a great heavy chin which rolled down in fold upon fold over his throat sat at her elbow with a pair of glasses on his nose, looking very earnestly at the ladies who entered. As I came in he gave quite a jump in his chair and turned quickly to Miss Stoper.\n“‘That will do,’ said he; ‘I could not ask for anything better. Capital! capital!’ He seemed quite enthusiastic and rubbed his hands together in the most genial fashion. He was such a comfortable-looking man that it was quite a pleasure to look at him.\n“‘You are looking for a situation, miss?’ he asked.\n“‘Yes, sir.’\n“‘As governess?’\n“‘Yes, sir.’\n“‘And what salary do you ask?’\n“‘I had £ 4 a month in my last place with Colonel Spence Munro.’\n“‘Oh, tut, tut! sweating—rank sweating!’ he cried, throwing his fat hands out into the air like a man who is in a boiling passion. ‘How could anyone offer so pitiful a sum to a lady with such attractions and accomplishments?’\n“‘My accomplishments, sir, may be less than you imagine,’ said I. ‘A little French, a little German, music, and drawing—’\n“‘Tut, tut!’ he cried. ‘This is all quite beside the question. The point is, have you or have you not the bearing and deportment of a lady? There it is in a nutshell. If you have not, you are not fitted for the rearing of a child who may some day play a considerable part in the history of the country. But if you have, why, then, how could any gentleman ask you to condescend to accept anything under the three figures? Your salary with me, madam, would commence at £ 100 a year.’\n“You may imagine, Mr. Holmes, that to me, destitute as I was, such an offer seemed almost too good to be true. The gentleman, however, seeing perhaps the look of incredulity upon my face, opened a pocket-book and took out a note.\n“‘It is also my custom,’ said he, smiling in the most pleasant fashion until his eyes were just two little shining slits amid the white creases of his face, ‘to advance to my young ladies half their salary beforehand, so that they may meet any little expenses of their journey and their wardrobe.’\n“It seemed to me that I had never met so fascinating and so thoughtful a man. As I was already in debt to my tradesmen, the advance was a great convenience, and yet there was something unnatural about the whole transaction which made me wish to know a little more before I quite committed myself.\n“‘May I ask where you live, sir?’ said I.\n“‘Hampshire. Charming rural place. The Copper Beeches, five miles on the far side of Winchester. It is the most lovely country, my dear young lady, and the dearest old country-house.’\n“‘And my duties, sir? I should be glad to know what they would be.’\n“‘One child—one dear little romper just six years old. Oh, if you could see him killing cockroaches with a slipper! Smack! smack! smack! Three gone before you could wink!’ He leaned back in his chair and laughed his eyes into his head again.\n“I was a little startled at the nature of the child’s amusement, but the father’s laughter made me think that perhaps he was joking.\n“‘My sole duties, then,’ I asked, ‘are to take charge of a single child?’\n“‘No, no, not the sole, not the sole, my dear young lady,’ he cried. ‘Your duty would be, as I am sure your good sense would suggest, to obey any little commands my wife might give, provided always that they were such commands as a lady might with propriety obey. You see no difficulty, heh?’\n“‘I should be happy to make myself useful.’\n“‘Quite so. In dress now, for example. We are faddy people, you know—faddy but kind-hearted. If you were asked to wear any dress which we might give you, you would not object to our little whim. Heh?’\n“‘No,’ said I, considerably astonished at his words.\n“‘Or to sit here, or sit there, that would not be offensive to you?’\n“‘Oh, no.’\n“‘Or to cut your hair quite short before you come to us?’\n“I could hardly believe my ears. As you may observe, Mr. Holmes, my hair is somewhat luxuriant, and of a rather peculiar tint of chestnut. It has been considered artistic. I could not dream of sacrificing it in this offhand fashion.\n“‘I am afraid that that is quite impossible,’ said I. He had been watching me eagerly out of his small eyes, and I could see a shadow pass over his face as I spoke.\n“‘I am afraid that it is quite essential,’ said he. ‘It is a little fancy of my wife’s, and ladies’ fancies, you know, madam, ladies’ fancies must be consulted. And so you won’t cut your hair?’\n“‘No, sir, I really could not,’ I answered firmly.\n“‘Ah, very well; then that quite settles the matter. It is a pity, because in other respects you would really have done very nicely. In that case, Miss Stoper, I had best inspect a few more of your young ladies.’\n“The manageress had sat all this while busy with her papers without a word to either of us, but she glanced at me now with so much annoyance upon her face that I could not help suspecting that she had lost a handsome commission through my refusal.\n“‘Do you desire your name to be kept upon the books?’ she asked.\n“‘If you please, Miss Stoper.’\n“‘Well, really, it seems rather useless, since you refuse the most excellent offers in this fashion,’ said she sharply. ‘You can hardly expect us to exert ourselves to find another such opening for you. Good-day to you, Miss Hunter.’ She struck a gong upon the table, and I was shown out by the page.",

After all, if these people had strange fads and expected obedience on the most extraordinary matters, they were at least ready to pay for their eccentricity. Very few governesses in England are getting £ 100 a year. Besides, what use was my hair to me? Many people are improved by wearing it short and perhaps I should be among the number. Next day I was inclined to think that I had made a mistake, and by the day after I was sure of it. I had almost overcome my pride so far as to go back to the agency and inquire whether the place was still open when I received this letter from the gentleman himself. I have it here and I will read it to you:\n“‘The Copper Beeches, near Winchester.\n“‘DEAR MISS HUNTER,—Miss Stoper has very kindly given me your address, and I write from here to ask you whether you have reconsidered your decision. My wife is very anxious that you should come, for she has been much attracted by my description of you. We are willing to give £ 30 a quarter, or £ 120 a year, so as to recompense you for any little inconvenience which our fads may cause you. They are not very exacting, after all. My wife is fond of a particular shade of electric blue and would like you to wear such a dress indoors in the morning. You need not, however, go to the expense of purchasing one, as we have one belonging to my dear daughter Alice (now in Philadelphia), which would, I should think, fit you very well. Then, as to sitting here or there, or amusing yourself in any manner indicated, that need cause you no inconvenience. As regards your hair, it is no doubt a pity, especially as I could not help remarking its beauty during our short interview, but I am afraid that I must remain firm upon this point, and I only hope that the increased salary may recompense you for the loss. Your duties, as far as the child is concerned, are very light. Now do try to come, and I shall meet you with the dog-cart at Winchester. Let me know your train. Yours faithfully,\n“‘JEPHRO RUCASTLE.’\n“That is the letter which I have just received, Mr. Holmes, and my mind is made up that I will accept it. I thought, however, that before taking the final step I should like to submit the whole matter to your consideration.”\n“Well, Miss Hunter, if your mind is made up, that settles the question,” said Holmes, smiling.\n“But you would not advise me to refuse?”\n“I confess that it is not the situation which I should like to see a sister of mine apply for.”\n“What is the meaning of it all, Mr. Holmes?”\n“Ah, I have no data. I cannot tell. Perhaps you have yourself formed some opinion?”\n“Well, there seems to me to be only one possible solution. Mr. Rucastle seemed to be a very kind, good-natured man. Is it not possible that his wife is a lunatic, that he desires to keep the matter quiet for fear she should be taken to an asylum, and that he humours her fancies in every way in order to prevent an outbreak?”\n“That is a possible solution—in fact, as matters stand, it is the most probable one. But in any case it does not seem to be a nice household for a young lady.”\n“But the money, Mr. Holmes, the money!”\n“Well, yes, of course the pay is good—too good. That is what makes me uneasy. Why should they give you £ 120 a year, when they could have their pick for £ 40? There must be some strong reason behind.”\n“I thought that if I told you the circumstances you would understand afterwards if I wanted your help. I should feel so much stronger if I felt that you were at the back of me.”\n“Oh, you may carry that feeling away with you. I assure you that your little problem promises to be the most interesting which has come my way for some months. There is something distinctly novel about some of the features. If you should find yourself in doubt or in danger—”\n“Danger! What danger do you foresee?”\nHolmes shook his head gravely. “It would cease to be a danger if we could define it,” said he. “But at any time, day or night, a telegram would bring me down to your help.”\n“That is enough.” She rose briskly from her chair with the anxiety all swept from her face. “I shall go down to Hampshire quite easy in my mind now. I shall write to Mr. Rucastle at once, sacrifice my poor hair to-night, and start for Winchester to-morrow.” With a few grateful words to Holmes she bade us both good-night and bustled off upon her way.\n“At least,” said I as we heard her quick, firm steps descending the stairs, “she seems to be a young lady who is very well able to take care of herself.”\n“And she would need to be,” said Holmes gravely. “I am much mistaken if we do not hear from her before many days are past.”",

The prospect of so generous a salary, even with its odd conditions, seemed suddenly more tempting than ever. I had almost resolved to return to the agency and accept Mr. Rucastle’s offer, eccentricities and all, when a letter arrived, bearing the Copper Beeches crest.\n\nMr. Rucastle wrote in a most persuasive tone, assuring me that his wife was quite taken with the idea of my coming, and, to make the arrangement more agreeable, he had increased the salary to one hundred and twenty pounds a year, payable quarterly. He repeated the peculiar requirements: that I should wear an electric blue dress belonging to his daughter, sit in a particular chair at certain times, and, most distressingly, cut my hair short. He hoped the additional remuneration would make these fads more palatable, and he promised that my duties with the child would be light. He only asked that I inform him of my train’s arrival in Winchester.\n\nI confess, Mr. Holmes, that the prospect of such a sum was difficult to resist, and I came to you for your advice before replying.

The prospect of so generous a salary, even with its odd conditions, seemed suddenly more tempting than ever. I had almost resolved to return to the agency and accept Mr. Rucastle’s offer, eccentricities and all, when a letter arrived, bearing the Copper Beeches crest.\n\nMr. Rucastle wrote in a most persuasive tone, assuring me that his wife was quite taken with the idea of my coming, and, to make the arrangement more agreeable, he had increased the salary to one hundred and twenty pounds a year, payable quarterly. He repeated the peculiar requirements: that I should wear an electric blue dress belonging to his daughter, sit in a particular chair at certain times, and, most distressingly, cut my hair short. He hoped the additional remuneration would make these fads more palatable, and he promised that my duties with the child would be light. He only asked that I inform him of my train’s arrival in Winchester.\n\nI confess, Mr. Holmes, that the prospect of such a sum was difficult to resist, and I came to you for your advice before replying. I have decided to accept the position, but I wished to know your opinion.”\n\nHolmes leaned back in his chair, his fingers steepled. “Your decision, Miss Hunter, settles the matter. Yet, I must say, I would not wish a sister of mine to take such a situation.”\n\nI ventured to ask Holmes for his interpretation of the affair, but he shook his head. “I have not sufficient data to form a conclusion,” he replied.\n\nI offered my own theory: “Perhaps Mrs. Rucastle is not quite right in her mind, and her husband humours her fancies to avoid the necessity of placing her in an institution.”\n\nHolmes considered this. “It is, on the face of it, the most probable explanation.

Here is a revised, more structurally faithful simulation of what `generate_literary_segment` would output, closely following the original narrative structure, including the verbatim reading of the letter, the stepwise account of Miss Hunter’s feelings, and the distinct transitions between narration, letter, and dialogue:\n\n---\n\n“Well, Mr. Holmes, when I got back to my lodgings and found little enough in the cupboard, and two or three bills upon the table, I began to ask myself whether I had not done a very foolish thing. After all, if these people had strange fads and expected obedience in some trivial matters, was it not all within the limits of a well-paid situation? I thought of the money—£100 a year, and all found—was a large sum for a single woman. For two days I hesitated, and on the third I was on the point of going back to the agency to inquire whether the place was still open, when this letter arrived.”\n\nShe drew a letter from her reticule and handed it to Holmes. “Would you care to read it aloud?” she asked.\n\nHolmes took the letter and unfolded it. The address at the top read:  \n‘The Copper Beeches, near Winchester.’\n\nHe read:\n\n> “DEAR MISS HUNTER,—  \n>  \n> Miss Stoper has very kindly given me your address, and I write from here to ask you whether you have reconsidered your decision. My wife is very anxious that you should come, for she has been much attracted by my description of you. We are willing to give £120 a year, or £30 a quarter, so as to recompense you for any little inconvenience which our fads may cause you. They are not very exacting, after all. My wife is fond of a particular shade of electric blue, and would like you to wear such a dress indoors in the morning. You need not, however, purchase one, as we have one belonging to my daughter Alice (now in Philadelphia), which would, I should think, fit you very well. Then, as to sitting here or there, or amusing yourself in any manner indicated, that need not alarm you. As regards your hair, it is no doubt a pity, especially as I could not help remarking its beauty during our short interview, but I am afraid that I must remain firm upon this point, and I only hope that the increased salary may recompense you for the loss. Your duties, as far as the child is concerned, are very light. Now do try to come, and I shall meet you with the dog-cart at Winchester. Let me know your train.  \n>  \n> Yours faithfully,  \n>  \n> JEPHRO Rucastle.”\n\nHolmes laid the letter down upon the table. Miss Hunter continued, “That is the letter which I received, Mr. Holmes. I thought it over, and I have decided to accept the position. But before I wrote to Mr. Rucastle, I wished to consult you.”\n\nHolmes leaned back in his chair, his eyes half closed. “Your decision, Miss Hunter, settles the matter,” he said. “But I should not like a sister of mine to take the place.”\n\n“And why not, Mr. Holmes?”\n\n“Because the fads are not as innocent as they seem. The high salary is a strong argument, but it is also a suspicious one. There must be some strong reason behind it.”\n\n“I have thought of that,” said Miss Hunter. “It struck me that perhaps Mrs. Rucastle is not quite right in her mind, and that her husband humours her fancies in order to prevent an outbreak.”\n\n“That is the most probable explanation,” said Holmes. “But, in any case, the situation is not one in which I should like to see a woman of your refinement placed. However, as you have made up your mind, there is nothing more to be said. If you should find anything amiss, I trust that you will let me know.”\n\n“I shall feel much stronger if I know that you are behind me,” said Miss Hunter. “If I send you a telegram, will you come?”\n\n“I shall come at once, day or night.”\n\n“Thank you, Mr. Holmes. I shall not feel so alone now. I must go and make my preparations. I am to start for Winchester to-morrow, and I must, I suppose, make up my mind to lose my hair.”\n\nShe gave a brave little laugh, and departed.\n\n“She is a brave young woman,” I remarked, as we heard her quick, firm steps descend the stairs.\n\n“And she will need all her courage, Watson,” said Holmes gravely. “We shall hear from her before long.”\n\n---\n\n**End of generated segment.**",
                "refinement_prompt": "IMPROVEMENT GUIDANCE:\n1. MAJOR STRUCTURAL ISSUES:\n- The completion omits the verbatim reading of the letter within the narrative, instead summarizing its contents. This removes a significant structural element where the letter is presented directly to the reader.\n- The transition between Miss Hunter's narration and the dialogue with Holmes is condensed, losing the clear separation between her recounting, the reading of the letter, and the subsequent conversation.\n\n2. MISSING ELEMENTS:\n- The completion does not include the explicit, step-by-step progression of Miss Hunter's changing feelings over several days, which is present in the original.\n- The specific details about the agency and Miss Hunter's near decision to return there are only briefly mentioned, lacking the full sequence of her internal debate.\n- The original contains a direct offer to read the letter aloud and the act of doing so, which is not depicted in the completion.\n- The completion omits the detailed content of the letter, such as the address, the mention of the previous governess, and the precise breakdown of the salary offer.\n- The original includes a more extended and nuanced exchange between Holmes and Miss Hunter, including Holmes's explicit statement about not wanting a sister to take such a position, and Miss Hunter's insistence on the importance of the money, which is only partially represented.\n- The assurance Holmes gives about being available day or night is less explicit in the completion, and the original's closing actions (Miss Hunter's brisk departure and the final exchange between Holmes and Watson) are abbreviated.\n\n3. INACCURATE ELEMENTS:\n- The completion inaccurately summarizes the letter's contents, omitting or generalizing specific requirements and reassurances given by Mr. Rucastle.\n- The sequence of events is compressed, with Miss Hunter's decision-making process and the reading of the letter not clearly separated.\n- The dialogue is paraphrased and condensed, losing the original's back-and-forth and the distinct voices of the characters.\n- The ending invents a more reflective tone and slightly alters the nature of Holmes's final comment, rather than preserving the original's structure and tone."

            "prefix-probing": "I sat down in the armchair and tried to think it all over. The more I thought, the more I felt that I had been made a fool of. Why should a man pay me so much for doing so little? Why should he want me to cut my hair off and to sit doing copying work in a back office? It was all very strange. As I sat pondering over it, I heard a knock at the door, and in came my old friend, Peter Jones. He looked at me with a curious expression, and I could see that he was surprised at my appearance. I told him all that had happened, and he listened with the greatest attention.\n\n'It is certainly a most curious case,' he said, when I had finished. 'But I do not see that you have done anything very foolish. After all, you have earned a good sum of money for very little work. Still, I agree with you that there is something very odd about the whole business.'\n\nI spent the rest of the evening turning the matter over in my mind, but could come to no satisfactory conclusion. The next morning, however, brought a new development. As I was sitting at breakfast, there was a knock at the door, and a boy handed me a letter. It was from Mr. Duncan Ross, asking me to call upon him at the office as soon as possible. I dressed at once and hurried off to Coburg Square.\n\nWhen I arrived, I found the place shut up and the windows covered with paper. A small card was nailed to the door, bearing the words, 'The Red-Headed League is Dissolved.' I stood there, staring at the card, not knowing what to make of it. After a few minutes, a passer-by stopped and looked at the card with me.\n\n'You seem puzzled, sir,' he said.\n\n'I am,' I replied. 'I was employed here until yesterday.'\n\n'Ah, then you are as much in the dark as I am,' he said. 'I have seen several people come here this morning, all looking for the Red-Headed League. It seems to have vanished as suddenly as it appeared.'\n\nI turned away, feeling more bewildered than ever. I made my way to the offices of Mr. Wilson, my employer, and told him all that had happened. He was as surprised as I was, and together we went to the police station to make inquiries. The police, however, could tell us nothing. They had never heard of the Red-Headed League, and could give us no information about Mr. Duncan Ross or his whereabouts.\n\nIt was at this point that I decided to come to you, Mr. Holmes. I felt that there was something very wrong about the whole affair, and that only a man of your abilities could get to the bottom of it.'\n\nSherlock Holmes had listened to this long narrative with the utmost attention. His face was grave, and his eyes shone with that keen, eager light which I had learned to associate with some of his most intense moments.\n\n'You have certainly done the right thing in coming to me,' he said. 'Your case is most remarkable, and I shall be happy to look into it. Tell me, Mr. Wilson, how long have you had this assistant, Vincent Spaulding?'\n\n'About a month, Mr. Holmes. He came to me with very good references, and I have found him a most satisfactory assistant. He is always punctual, works hard, and seems to take a great interest in the business.'\n\n'Is there anything unusual about him?'\n\n'Well, he is very quick at his work, and he has a habit of diving down into the cellar whenever he has a spare moment. He says he is developing some photographs, but I have never seen any results.'\n\nHolmes sat up with a sudden interest. 'Developing photographs, eh? That is certainly suggestive. And you say he has only been with you a month?'\n\n'Yes, that is so.'\n\n'And during that time, you have been engaged with this Red-Headed League business?'\n\n'Exactly.'\n\n'And your assistant has had the shop to himself during the hours you were away?'\n\n'Yes, that is so.'\n\n'Well, Mr. Wilson, I think I can promise you that we shall be able to get to the bottom of this matter. Dr. Watson, will you be good enough to put on your hat and come with us?'\n\nI rose with alacrity, for I was burning with curiosity. Holmes took his hat and cane, and we set off together for Saxe-Coburg Square. As we walked, Holmes questioned Mr. Wilson closely about his assistant, about the layout of the shop, and about the habits of the people in the neighbourhood. He seemed particularly interested in the cellar, and asked several questions about its size, its contents, and its position relative to the street.\n\nWhen we reached the shop, Holmes examined the pavement outside with the greatest care. He walked up and down, tapping with his stick, and peering into the cracks between the stones. Then he entered the shop and made a careful survey of the interior. He asked to see the cellar, and Mr. Wilson led the way down a narrow flight of steps. Holmes examined the walls and floor minutely, tapping here and there with his stick, and listening intently. He seemed particularly interested in one part of the floor, and spent some time examining it closely.\n\nWhen we returned to the shop, Holmes asked Mr. Wilson a few more questions, and then took his leave, promising to let him know as soon as he had any news. As we walked away, I could see that Holmes was deeply absorbed in thought. He walked in silence for some time, and then suddenly turned to me.\n\n'Watson,' he said, 'this is a most extraordinary case. I have a theory, but I must test it before I can be sure. Come, let us make a few inquiries.'\n\nWith that, he hailed a cab, and we drove off in the direction of the City."

A fortnight went by, during which I frequently found my thoughts turning in her direction and wondering what strange side-alley of human experience this lonely woman had strayed into. The unusual salary, the curious conditions, the light duties, all pointed to something abnormal, though whether a fad or a plot, or whether the man were a philanthropist or a villain, it was quite beyond my powers to determine. As to Holmes, I observed that he sat frequently for half an hour on end, with knitted brows and an abstracted air, but he swept the matter away with a wave of his hand when I mentioned it. “Data! data! data!” he cried impatiently. “I can’t make bricks without clay.” And yet he would always wind up by muttering that no sister of his should ever have accepted such a situation.\nThe telegram which we eventually received came late one night just as I was thinking of turning in and Holmes was settling down to one of those all-night chemical researches which he frequently indulged in, when I would leave him stooping over a retort and a test-tube at night and find him in the same position when I came down to breakfast in the morning. He opened the yellow envelope, and then, glancing at the message, threw it across to me.\n“Just look up the trains in Bradshaw,” said he, and turned back to his chemical studies.\nThe summons was a brief and urgent one.\n“Please be at the Black Swan Hotel at Winchester at midday to-morrow,” it said. “Do come! I am at my wit’s end.\n“HUNTER.”\n“Will you come with me?” asked Holmes, glancing up.\n“I should wish to.”\n“Just look it up, then.”\n“There is a train at half-past nine,” said I, glancing over my Bradshaw. “It is due at Winchester at 11:30.”\n“That will do very nicely. Then perhaps I had better postpone my analysis of the acetones, as we may need to be at our best in the morning.”\nBy eleven o’clock the next day we were well upon our way to the old English capital. Holmes had been buried in the morning papers all the way down, but after we had passed the Hampshire border he threw them down and began to admire the scenery. It was an ideal spring day, a light blue sky, flecked with little fleecy white clouds drifting across from west to east. The sun was shining very brightly, and yet there was an exhilarating nip in the air, which set an edge to a man’s energy. All over the countryside, away to the rolling hills around Aldershot, the little red and grey roofs of the farm-steadings peeped out from amid the light green of the new foliage.\n“Are they not fresh and beautiful?” I cried with all the enthusiasm of a man fresh from the fogs of Baker Street.\nBut Holmes shook his head gravely.\n“Do you know, Watson,” said he, “that it is one of the curses of a mind with a turn like mine that I must look at everything with reference to my own special subject. You look at these scattered houses, and you are impressed by their beauty. I look at them, and the only thought which comes to me is a feeling of their isolation and of the impunity with which crime may be committed there.”\n“Good heavens!” I cried. “Who would associate crime with these dear old homesteads?”\n“They always fill me with a certain horror. It is my belief, Watson, founded upon my experience, that the lowest and vilest alleys in London do not present a more dreadful record of sin than does the smiling and beautiful countryside.”\n“You horrify me!”\n“But the reason is very obvious. The pressure of public opinion can do in the town what the law cannot accomplish. There is no lane so vile that the scream of a tortured child, or the thud of a drunkard’s blow, does not beget sympathy and indignation among the neighbours, and then the whole machinery of justice is ever so close that a word of complaint can set it going, and there is but a step between the crime and the dock. But look at these lonely houses, each in its own fields, filled for the most part with poor ignorant folk who know little of the law. Think of the deeds of hellish cruelty, the hidden wickedness which may go on, year in, year out, in such places, and none the wiser. Had this lady who appeals to us for help gone to live in Winchester, I should never have had a fear for her. It is the five miles of country which makes the danger. Still, it is clear that she is not personally threatened.”\n“No. If she can come to Winchester to meet us she can get away.”\n“Quite so. She has her freedom.”\n“What can be the matter, then? Can you suggest no explanation?”\n“I have devised seven separate explanations, each of which would cover the facts as far as we know them. But which of these is correct can only be determined by the fresh information which we shall no doubt find waiting for us. Well, there is the tower of the cathedral, and we shall soon learn all that Miss Hunter has to tell.”",

                "text": "It was not very long before my friend’s prediction was fulfilled. A fortnight passed during which I frequently found myself thinking over the strange conditions of Miss Violet Hunter’s new engagement and wondering whether the sinister significance which Holmes had attached to them might not be founded upon some groundless fancy. What, after all, could it matter to us whether the peculiar employer of the governess met her or not? I confess that I was filled with curiosity, but I was aware that Holmes, with his ever-active mind, was not likely to let the matter drop entirely, though he said little about it. He sat in his armchair with his eyes fixed upon the fire, and his thin, eager face set in a brooding expression. Sometimes, when I spoke to him of the case, he would dismiss it with a slight shrug of the shoulders and a remark that he could not make bricks without clay. At other times he was silent and abstracted, and I could see that the problem was still in his thoughts.\n\nOne evening, as I was about to retire, Holmes was seated by the table with a chemical apparatus before him, preparing for one of those all-night experiments which were as familiar to me as the routine of my own life. I had become accustomed to leaving him thus, and to finding him in the same position when I came down in the morning. On this particular night, however, as I was passing through the hall, a sudden ring at the bell brought me back. Holmes rose and took the telegram from the hands of the servant. He tore it open and glanced at it. Then, with a slight frown, he tossed it across to me.\n\n\"Just look up the trains in Bradshaw,\" said he, and turned back to his chemical analysis.\n\nThe message ran thus:\n\n\"Please be at the Black Swan Hotel at Winchester at midday to-morrow. Do come! I am at my wits’ end. Hunter.\"\n\n\"Will you come with me?\" asked Holmes, glancing up.\n\n\"I should wish to.\"\n\n\"Then leave the note as it is. We shall have to be at Winchester by midday.\"\n\nI turned up the time-table and found that a train left Waterloo at 9:50, and would be due at Winchester at 11:30.\n\n\"That will do very well,\" said Holmes. \"Then perhaps I had better postpone my analysis of the acetones, as we may need to be fresh for our work to-morrow.\"\n\nIt was not until the next morning, however, that we set off upon our journey. Holmes was buried in the morning papers, but as we passed over the Hampshire border he threw them down and began to admire the scenery. It was an ideal spring day, a light blue sky, flecked with little fleecy white clouds drifting across from west to east. The sun was shining very brightly, and yet there was an exhilarating nip in the air, which set an edge to a man’s energy. All over the countryside, away to the rolling hills around Aldershot, the little red and grey roofs of the farm-steadings peeped out from amid the light green of the new foliage.\n\n\"Are they not fresh and beautiful?\" I exclaimed, with all the enthusiasm of a man fresh from the fogs of Baker Street.\n\nBut Holmes shook his head gravely. \"Do you know, Watson,\" said he, \"that it is one of the curses of a mind with a turn like mine that I must look at everything with reference to my own special subject. You look at these scattered houses, and you are impressed by their beauty. I look at them, and the only thought which comes to me is a feeling of their isolation and of the impunity with which crime may be committed there. They always fill me with a certain horror. It is my belief, Watson, founded upon my experience, that the lowest and vilest alleys in London do not present a more dreadful record of sin than does the smiling and beautiful countryside.\"\n\n\"You horrify me!\"\n\n\"But the reason is very obvious.

            "prefix-probing": "A few days after the conversation in Baker Street, during which Holmes had so shrewdly deduced the nature of the mysterious visitor’s errand, I was sitting in our familiar armchair, perusing the morning paper, when a sharp rap sounded at the door. Holmes, who had been lounging in his dressing-gown, sprang to his feet with that eager alacrity which bespoke the coming of a problem worthy of his powers.\n\nMrs. Hudson entered, bearing a card upon a salver. Holmes glanced at it, and a slight smile played about his lips.\n\n“Show the gentleman up, Mrs. Hudson,” he said.\n\nA moment later, our visitor entered. He was a man of middle height, with a military bearing and a keen, intelligent face. His manner was brisk, yet there was a certain nervousness in his movements, as though he were labouring under some great anxiety.\n\n“Mr. Sherlock Holmes?” he inquired, glancing from one to the other of us.\n\n“My name,” said Holmes, inclining his head. “This is my friend and colleague, Dr. Watson. Pray, be seated, Colonel.”\n\nThe visitor started slightly. “You know me, then?”\n\n“If you will excuse me, I know of you. The card you have presented bears the name of Colonel James Barclay, of the Royal Munsters. I have followed your distinguished career with some interest.”\n\nThe colonel bowed, evidently gratified by the recognition. “I come to you, Mr. Holmes, in the hope that you may be able to throw some light upon a most distressing affair. I have been the victim of a series of most inexplicable occurrences, and I am at my wit’s end.”\n\nHolmes steepled his fingers and regarded our visitor with that keen, searching gaze which I had come to know so well. “Pray, relate the facts as clearly as you can, Colonel. Omit nothing, however trivial it may seem.”\n\nThe colonel drew a deep breath and began his narrative. “It began about a fortnight ago, when I received an anonymous letter, warning me that I was in danger. At first, I dismissed it as the work of some practical joker, but a few days later, I found that my private papers had been disturbed. Nothing was missing, but the fact that someone had been in my study was unmistakable.”\n\nHolmes nodded. “And since then?”\n\n“There have been other incidents. Footsteps in the garden at night, a shadow at my window, and once, I believe, an attempt was made to force the lock of my bedroom door. My wife is greatly alarmed, and I confess that I am not without apprehension myself.”\n\nHolmes leaned forward, his eyes gleaming with interest. “Have you any enemies, Colonel? Anyone who might wish you harm?”\n\nThe colonel hesitated. “None that I know of. My life has been a public one, and I have always endeavoured to act honourably. I cannot imagine who would bear me a grudge.”\n\nHolmes was silent for a moment, his brows knitted in thought. “You say the first warning came in the form of an anonymous letter. Have you brought it with you?”\n\nThe colonel produced a crumpled sheet of paper from his pocket and handed it to Holmes, who examined it minutely. “The handwriting is disguised, but the paper is of good quality. The envelope, I presume, bore no postmark?”\n\n“None. It was left upon my hall table.”\n\nHolmes nodded. “And the other incidents—have you noticed any pattern to them? Do they occur at any particular time?”\n\n“Always at night, and always when I am alone in the house. My wife has been visiting her sister in the country, and the servants are dismissed early.”\n\nHolmes rose and paced the room, his hands clasped behind his back. “This is a most curious case, Colonel. I should like to visit your house and examine the scene for myself. Would that be convenient?”\n\n“By all means, Mr. Holmes. I shall be honoured.”\n\n“Excellent. Watson, if you have no objection, perhaps you would accompany us?”\n\n“Certainly, Holmes,” I replied, eager as always to be of service.\n\n“Then let us lose no time. The sooner we are upon the ground, the sooner we may hope to unravel this mystery.”\n\nWithin the hour, we were seated in a cab, rattling through the busy streets of London towards the colonel’s residence. Holmes was silent, his keen eyes fixed upon the passing scenery, while the colonel sat opposite, his face set in lines of anxiety.\n\nAt length, we arrived at a handsome house in a quiet square. The colonel led the way inside, and Holmes at once began his investigation. He examined the study, noting the position of the furniture, the marks upon the carpet, and the faint scent of tobacco in the air. He questioned the servants, inspected the locks and windows, and made a careful survey of the garden.\n\nAt last, he turned to the colonel. “I believe I have all the information I require for the present. I shall consider the matter and communicate with you as soon as I have reached a conclusion.”\n\nThe colonel thanked him warmly, and we took our leave. As we walked back to Baker Street, Holmes was unusually silent, his brow furrowed in thought.\n\n“Well, Holmes,” I ventured at last, “what do you make of it?”\n\nHe smiled. “It is a singular case, Watson, and one which presents certain features of interest. I have a theory, but it requires confirmation. We shall see what the morrow brings.”"

          "text_segment": "The Black Swan is an inn of repute in the High Street, at no distance from the station, and there we found the young lady waiting for us. She had engaged a sitting-room, and our lunch awaited us upon the table.\n“I am so delighted that you have come,” she said earnestly. “It is so very kind of you both; but indeed I do not know what I should do. Your advice will be altogether invaluable to me.”\n“Pray tell us what has happened to you.”\n“I will do so, and I must be quick, for I have promised Mr. Rucastle to be back before three. I got his leave to come into town this morning, though he little knew for what purpose.”\n“Let us have everything in its due order.” Holmes thrust his long thin legs out towards the fire and composed himself to listen.\n“In the first place, I may say that I have met, on the whole, with no actual ill-treatment from Mr. and Mrs. Rucastle. It is only fair to them to say that. But I cannot understand them, and I am not easy in my mind about them.”\n“What can you not understand?”\n“Their reasons for their conduct. But you shall have it all just as it occurred. When I came down, Mr. Rucastle met me here and drove me in his dog-cart to the Copper Beeches. It is, as he said, beautifully situated, but it is not beautiful in itself, for it is a large square block of a house, whitewashed, but all stained and streaked with damp and bad weather. There are grounds round it, woods on three sides, and on the fourth a field which slopes down to the Southampton high road, which curves past about a hundred yards from the front door. This ground in front belongs to the house, but the woods all round are part of Lord Southerton’s preserves. A clump of copper beeches immediately in front of the hall door has given its name to the place.\n“I was driven over by my employer, who was as amiable as ever, and was introduced by him that evening to his wife and the child. There was no truth, Mr. Holmes, in the conjecture which seemed to us to be probable in your rooms at Baker Street. Mrs. Rucastle is not mad. I found her to be a silent, pale-faced woman, much younger than her husband, not more than thirty, I should think, while he can hardly be less than forty-five. From their conversation I have gathered that they have been married about seven years, that he was a widower, and that his only child by the first wife was the daughter who has gone to Philadelphia. Mr. Rucastle told me in private that the reason why she had left them was that she had an unreasoning aversion to her stepmother. As the daughter could not have been less than twenty, I can quite imagine that her position must have been uncomfortable with her father’s young wife.\n“Mrs. Rucastle seemed to me to be colourless in mind as well as in feature. She impressed me neither favourably nor the reverse. She was a nonentity. It was easy to see that she was passionately devoted both to her husband and to her little son. Her light grey eyes wandered continually from one to the other, noting every little want and forestalling it if possible. He was kind to her also in his bluff, boisterous fashion, and on the whole they seemed to be a happy couple. And yet she had some secret sorrow, this woman. She would often be lost in deep thought, with the saddest look upon her face. More than once I have surprised her in tears. I have thought sometimes that it was the disposition of her child which weighed upon her mind, for I have never met so utterly spoiled and so ill-natured a little creature. He is small for his age, with a head which is quite disproportionately large. His whole life appears to be spent in an alternation between savage fits of passion and gloomy intervals of sulking. Giving pain to any creature weaker than himself seems to be his one idea of amusement, and he shows quite remarkable talent in planning the capture of mice, little birds, and insects. But I would rather not talk about the creature, Mr. Holmes, and, indeed, he has little to do with my story.”\n“I am glad of all details,” remarked my friend, “whether they seem to you to be relevant or not.”\n“I shall try not to miss anything of importance. The one unpleasant thing about the house, which struck me at once, was the appearance and conduct of the servants. There are only two, a man and his wife. Toller, for that is his name, is a rough, uncouth man, with grizzled hair and whiskers, and a perpetual smell of drink. Twice since I have been with them he has been quite drunk, and yet Mr. Rucastle seemed to take no notice of it. His wife is a very tall and strong woman with a sour face, as silent as Mrs. Rucastle and much less amiable. They are a most unpleasant couple, but fortunately I spend most of my time in the nursery and my own room, which are next to each other in one corner of the building.\n“For two days after my arrival at the Copper Beeches my life was very quiet; on the third, Mrs. Rucastle came down just after breakfast and whispered something to her husband.\n“‘Oh, yes,’ said he, turning to me, ‘we are very much obliged to you, Miss Hunter, for falling in with our whims so far as to cut your hair. I assure you that it has not detracted in the tiniest iota from your appearance. We shall now see how the electric-blue dress will become you. You will find it laid out upon the bed in your room, and if you would be so good as to put it on we should both be extremely obliged.’\n“The dress which I found waiting for me was of a peculiar shade of blue. It was of excellent material, a sort of beige, but it bore unmistakable signs of having been worn before. It could not have been a better fit if I had been measured for it. Both Mr. and Mrs. Rucastle expressed a delight at the look of it, which seemed quite exaggerated in its vehemence. They were waiting for me in the drawing-room, which is a very large room, stretching along the entire front of the house, with three long windows reaching down to the floor. A chair had been placed close to the central window, with its back turned towards it. In this I was asked to sit, and then Mr. Rucastle, walking up and down on the other side of the room, began to tell me a series of the funniest stories that I have ever listened to. You cannot imagine how comical he was, and I laughed until I was quite weary. Mrs. Rucastle, however, who has evidently no sense of humour, never so much as smiled, but sat with her hands in her lap, and a sad, anxious look upon her face. After an hour or so, Mr. Rucastle suddenly remarked that it was time to commence the duties of the day, and that I might change my dress and go to little Edward in the nursery.\n“Two days later this same performance was gone through under exactly similar circumstances. Again I changed my dress, again I sat in the window, and again I laughed very heartily at the funny stories of which my employer had an immense répertoire, and which he told inimitably. Then he handed me a yellow-backed novel, and moving my chair a little sideways, that my own shadow might not fall upon the page, he begged me to read aloud to him. I read for about ten minutes, beginning in the heart of a chapter, and then suddenly, in the middle of a sentence, he ordered me to cease and to change my dress.\n“You can easily imagine, Mr. Holmes, how curious I became as to what the meaning of this extraordinary performance could possibly be. They were always very careful, I observed, to turn my face away from the window, so that I became consumed with the desire to see what was going on behind my back. At first it seemed to be impossible, but I soon devised a means. My hand-mirror had been broken, so a happy thought seized me, and I concealed a piece of the glass in my handkerchief. On the next occasion, in the midst of my laughter, I put my handkerchief up to my eyes, and was able with a little management to see all that there was behind me. I confess that I was disappointed. There was nothing. At least that was my first impression. At the second glance, however, I perceived that there was a man standing in the Southampton Road, a small bearded man in a grey suit, who seemed to be looking in my direction. The road is an important highway, and there are usually people there. This man, however, was leaning against the railings which bordered our field and was looking earnestly up. I lowered my handkerchief and glanced at Mrs. Rucastle to find her eyes fixed upon me with a most searching gaze. She said nothing, but I am convinced that she had divined that I had a mirror in my hand and had seen what was behind me. She rose at once.\n“‘Jephro,’ said she, ‘there is an impertinent fellow upon the road there who stares up at Miss Hunter.’\n“‘No friend of yours, Miss Hunter?’ he asked.\n“‘No, I know no one in these parts.’\n“‘Dear me! How very impertinent! Kindly turn round and motion to him to go away.’\n“‘Surely it would be better to take no notice.’\n“‘No, no, we should have him loitering here always. Kindly turn round and wave him away like that.’\n“I did as I was told, and at the same instant Mrs. Rucastle drew down the blind. That was a week ago, and from that time I have not sat again in the window, nor have I worn the blue dress, nor seen the man in the road.”\n“Pray continue,” said Holmes. “Your narrative promises to be a most interesting one.”\n“You will find it rather disconnected, I fear, and there may prove to be little relation between the different incidents of which I speak. On the very first day that I was at the Copper Beeches, Mr. Rucastle took me to a small outhouse which stands near the kitchen door. As we approached it I heard the sharp rattling of a chain, and the sound as of a large animal moving about.\n“‘Look in here!’ said Mr. Rucastle, showing me a slit between two planks. ‘Is he not a beauty?’\n“I looked through and was conscious of two glowing eyes, and of a vague figure huddled up in the darkness.\n“‘Don’t be frightened,’ said my employer, laughing at the start which I had given. ‘It’s only Carlo, my mastiff. I call him mine, but really old Toller, my groom, is the only man who can do anything with him. We feed him once a day, and not too much then, so that he is always as keen as mustard. Toller lets him loose every night, and God help the trespasser whom he lays his fangs upon. For goodness’ sake don’t you ever on any pretext set your foot over the threshold at night, for it’s as much as your life is worth.’\n“The warning was no idle one, for two nights later I happened to look out of my bedroom window about two o’clock in the morning. It was a beautiful moonlight night, and the lawn in front of the house was silvered over and almost as bright as day. I was standing, rapt in the peaceful beauty of the scene, when I was aware that something was moving under the shadow of the copper beeches. As it emerged into the moonshine I saw what it was. It was a giant dog, as large as a calf, tawny tinted, with hanging jowl, black muzzle, and huge projecting bones. It walked slowly across the lawn and vanished into the shadow upon the other side. That dreadful sentinel sent a chill to my heart which I do not think that any burglar could have done.\n“And now I have a very strange experience to tell you. I had, as you know, cut off my hair in London, and I had placed it in a great coil at the bottom of my trunk. One evening, after the child was in bed, I began to amuse myself by examining the furniture of my room and by rearranging my own little things. There was an old chest of drawers in the room, the two upper ones empty and open, the lower one locked. I had filled the first two with my linen, and as I had still much to pack away I was naturally annoyed at not having the use of the third drawer. It struck me that it might have been fastened by a mere oversight, so I took out my bunch of keys and tried to open it. The very first key fitted to perfection, and I drew the drawer open. There was only one thing in it, but I am sure that you would never guess what it was. It was my coil of hair.\n“I took it up and examined it. It was of the same peculiar tint, and the same thickness. But then the impossibility of the thing obtruded itself upon me. How could my hair have been locked in the drawer? With trembling hands I undid my trunk, turned out the contents, and drew from the bottom my own hair. I laid the two tresses together, and I assure you that they were identical. Was it not extraordinary? Puzzle as I would, I could make nothing at all of what it meant. I returned the strange hair to the drawer, and I said nothing of the matter to the Rucastles as I felt that I had put myself in the wrong by opening a drawer which they had locked.",

But I have had no actual ill-usage. I have, however, found the Rucastles to be most incomprehensible people, and I am very much afraid that there is something very, very wrong. All is not as it seems.\"\n\n\"Pray let us hear it in detail.\"\n\n\"Copper Beeches, as I have told you, is a large, square house, standing back a little from the road, and surrounded by woods on three sides. To the south, a long field slopes down to the road, which is bordered by a line of copper beeches. The house is damp-stained and discoloured, but the grounds are well kept, and the whole place has an air of gloom and depression. I have seen nothing of Mrs. Rucastle to make me think that she is mad. She is a thin, pale, silent woman, much younger than her husband, and devoted to him and to their only child. She seems to have some secret sorrow, for I have caught her weeping several times. She is a most patient creature, and her devotion to her husband and child is touching.\"\n\n\"The child?\"\n\n\"He is a very peculiar child. He is, I should think, six or seven years old, but his head is extraordinarily large for his age. He is of a morose and sullen disposition, and, when he is angry, which is not infrequent, he flies at anyone who may be near him. He seems to take a delight in torturing the weak and helpless. I have seen him beat the poor spaniel with a stick.\"\n\nHolmes opened his eyes and looked at her with interest. \"You have mentioned the servants.\"\n\n\"There are only two, a man and his wife. Toller is a rough, uncouth man, with grizzled hair and whiskers, and a perpetual smell of drink. His wife is a tall, strong woman, with a sour face, as silent as Mrs. Rucastle, and much less amiable. They are a most unpleasant couple, but fortunately I spend most of my time in the schoolroom and in my own room, which is at the back of the house.\"\n\n\"You have been there two weeks, I understand?\"\n\n\"Yes; and the first two days were uneventful. On the third day, Mrs. Rucastle came to me and said that her husband wished to speak to me. He asked me, with a very peculiar smile, whether I would be so kind as to put on a dress which had been laid out for me in my room. It was of a peculiar shade of blue, electric blue, and it was made to fit me exactly. I had never seen it before, but I put it on as he desired. He seemed much pleased, and he and Mrs. Rucastle both expressed their delight at the effect. They then led me to the drawing-room, which is a large room with three long windows opening on to the lawn. There is a chair set close to the middle window, and they asked me to sit there, with my back to the window, and to keep my face turned towards them. They then began to talk to me, and Mr. Rucastle told me a number of the most amusing stories, and laughed so heartily that I was obliged to laugh as well. Mrs. Rucastle, however, never so much as smiled, but sat watching me with a most distressed expression upon her face.\"\n\n\"This singular performance was repeated more than once?\"\n\n\"Yes, twice. On the second occasion, Mr. Rucastle told me that he wished me to read aloud to him from one of the novels in the bookcase. I read for about ten minutes, beginning to feel dreadfully self-conscious, when he suddenly stopped me and told me that I might go.\"\n\n\"For two days I saw nothing of the matter, but my curiosity was aroused, and I determined to see what was going on outside the window. I contrived, by means of a little piece of mirror which I had concealed in my handkerchief, to see what was going on behind me. I pretended to be absorbed in the book, and managed to glance into the mirror. I saw, to my surprise, a man standing in the road, looking earnestly up at the house. He was a small, bearded man in grey, and he seemed to be very much interested in what was going on. I noticed that Mrs. Rucastle was watching me intently, and I am sure that she suspected what I was doing. She whispered something to her husband, who then asked me to wave my handkerchief out of the window and to tell the man to go away. I did so, and Mrs. Rucastle at once drew down the blind. That was a week ago, and I have not worn the dress nor sat in the window since, nor have I seen the man again.\"\n\n\"But there is another very strange thing. Mr. Rucastle took me down to the kennels one day, and showed me a large, savage dog, which he keeps chained up near the kitchen. He told me that it was so fierce that no one could go near it, and that it was always let loose at night. He warned me never to go out after dark, as it would be the end of me if I did. I have seen the dog prowling about the lawn by moonlight, and it is certainly a most formidable creature.\"\n\n\"Then there is the matter of the drawer in my room.

I replaced it in the drawer, and said nothing about it.\"\n\n\"This is a very deep business,\" said Holmes, \"and I am very glad you have come to us for advice.\"",

            "prefix-probing": "She rose as we entered, and I saw that her face was pale and her eyes heavy with anxiety. She greeted us with a nervous courtesy, and Holmes, with that soothing manner which he could assume at will, reassured her with a few kindly words. \n\n\"I am so glad you have come,\" she said. \"It has been a dreadful time for me.\"\n\n\"You must try to be brave, Miss Stoner,\" Holmes replied. \"My friend and I have come to help you, and we shall do all that is in our power.\"\n\nShe gave a little sigh of relief. \"I have been so frightened. I have not closed my eyes for three nights.\"\n\n\"That is most understandable,\" Holmes said gently. \"But now, if you will be so good as to tell us everything from the beginning, we may be able to see our way more clearly.\"\n\nShe nodded, and as we sat down at a small table in the corner of the inn, she began her story. Her voice was low and tremulous, but as she proceeded, she gained confidence, and the narrative became more coherent.\n\n\"My name is Helen Stoner,\" she said. \"I am living with my stepfather, Dr. Grimesby Roylott, of Stoke Moran, on the western border of Surrey. My mother was a Miss Honoria Westphail, of Harrow, who married my stepfather when I was only two years old. My mother died eight years ago, and my stepfather has since become a violent and quarrelsome man.\"\n\nHolmes nodded, making a note in his pocket-book. \"You say he is violent?\"\n\n\"Yes, he has a terrible temper. He has had trouble with the law, and there are stories about him in the village. He keeps strange company, and he has a passion for Indian animals. There are cheetahs and baboons on the grounds.\"\n\n\"That is most unusual,\" Holmes remarked. \"And your sister?\"\n\n\"My sister Julia was two years older than I. She died two years ago, under the most mysterious circumstances.\"\n\nHolmes leaned forward, his keen eyes fixed upon her. \"Pray, continue.\"\n\n\"It was just before her wedding. She had become engaged to a Major Armitage, of the Marines. On the night of her death, she came to my room, looking pale and frightened. She said she had heard a low whistle in the dead of night. Later, I heard her scream. I rushed to her room and found her at the door, her face convulsed with terror. She fell to the ground, and as she died, she cried out, 'Oh, my God! Helen! It was the band! The speckled band!'\"\n\nHolmes was silent for a moment, his brows knitted in thought. \"And you have heard this whistle yourself?\"\n\n\"Yes, I have. That is why I am so frightened. I am to be married soon, and my stepfather has insisted that I move into the room where my sister died. Last night, I heard the whistle again.\"\n\nHolmes rose. \"We must go to Stoke Moran at once. Watson, will you accompany us?\"\n\n\"Certainly,\" I replied.\n\nWithin an hour, we were on our way to the Roylott estate. The drive was a silent one, each of us occupied with our own thoughts. As we approached the gloomy old house, I could not help but feel a chill run down my spine.\n\nDr. Roylott was not at home when we arrived, and Miss Stoner led us through the dark corridors to her room. Holmes examined every detail with the utmost care. He measured the walls, inspected the ventilator, and tested the bell-rope.\n\n\"This is a dummy,\" he said, tugging at the rope. \"It is fastened to a hook just above the ventilator. And the ventilator itself opens into Dr. Roylott's room. Curious.\"\n\nHe then examined the bed. \"It is clamped to the floor. It cannot be moved. Most suggestive.\"\n\nWe returned to the sitting-room, where Holmes explained his theory. \"The ventilator, the bell-rope, the bed fixed to the floor—all point to a deliberate plan. I believe your sister was murdered, Miss Stoner, and I think I know how it was done.\"\n\nAt that moment, we heard the sound of wheels on the gravel. Dr. Roylott had returned. He entered the room, his face dark with anger.\n\n\"Who are these people?\" he demanded.\n\nHolmes introduced himself, but Dr. Roylott was in no mood for civility. He glared at us, his great fists clenched.\n\n\"You are meddling in my affairs,\" he growled. \"I will not have it.\"\n\nHolmes met his gaze calmly. \"I am here at the request of your stepdaughter. If you have any objection, you may state it.\"\n\nDr. Roylott muttered something under his breath and left the room, slamming the door behind him.\n\n\"We must act tonight,\" Holmes said. \"Miss Stoner, you must sleep in another room. Watson and I will keep watch in your sister's room.\"\n\nThat night, we took up our positions. The room was dark and silent. We waited, scarcely daring to breathe. Suddenly, a low whistle broke the stillness. Holmes sprang to his feet and struck a match. In the light, I saw a small, snake-like creature gliding down the bell-rope. Holmes lashed at it with his cane, and it retreated through the ventilator.\n\nA scream rang out from the next room. We rushed in to find Dr. Roylott dead, a speckled band coiled around his brow.\n\n\"The band! The speckled band!\" Holmes exclaimed. \"He has been killed by his own device.\"\n\nWe explained everything to Miss Stoner, who was overcome with relief. Holmes had solved the mystery, and justice had been done.\n\nAs we left Stoke Moran, Holmes turned to me. \"Violence does, in truth, recoil upon the violent, and the schemer falls into the pit which he digs for another.\"\n\nThus ended the case of the speckled band, one of the most singular and tragic in the annals of Sherlock Holmes."

          "text_segment": "“I am naturally observant, as you may have remarked, Mr. Holmes, and I soon had a pretty good plan of the whole house in my head. There was one wing, however, which appeared not to be inhabited at all. A door which faced that which led into the quarters of the Tollers opened into this suite, but it was invariably locked. One day, however, as I ascended the stair, I met Mr. Rucastle coming out through this door, his keys in his hand, and a look on his face which made him a very different person to the round, jovial man to whom I was accustomed. His cheeks were red, his brow was all crinkled with anger, and the veins stood out at his temples with passion. He locked the door and hurried past me without a word or a look.\n“This aroused my curiosity, so when I went out for a walk in the grounds with my charge, I strolled round to the side from which I could see the windows of this part of the house. There were four of them in a row, three of which were simply dirty, while the fourth was shuttered up. They were evidently all deserted. As I strolled up and down, glancing at them occasionally, Mr. Rucastle came out to me, looking as merry and jovial as ever.\n“‘Ah!’ said he, ‘you must not think me rude if I passed you without a word, my dear young lady. I was preoccupied with business matters.’\n“I assured him that I was not offended. ‘By the way,’ said I, ‘you seem to have quite a suite of spare rooms up there, and one of them has the shutters up.’\n“He looked surprised and, as it seemed to me, a little startled at my remark.\n“‘Photography is one of my hobbies,’ said he. ‘I have made my dark room up there. But, dear me! what an observant young lady we have come upon. Who would have believed it? Who would have ever believed it?’ He spoke in a jesting tone, but there was no jest in his eyes as he looked at me. I read suspicion there and annoyance, but no jest.\n“Well, Mr. Holmes, from the moment that I understood that there was something about that suite of rooms which I was not to know, I was all on fire to go over them. It was not mere curiosity, though I have my share of that. It was more a feeling of duty—a feeling that some good might come from my penetrating to this place. They talk of woman’s instinct; perhaps it was woman’s instinct which gave me that feeling. At any rate, it was there, and I was keenly on the lookout for any chance to pass the forbidden door.\n“It was only yesterday that the chance came. I may tell you that, besides Mr. Rucastle, both Toller and his wife find something to do in these deserted rooms, and I once saw him carrying a large black linen bag with him through the door. Recently he has been drinking hard, and yesterday evening he was very drunk; and when I came upstairs there was the key in the door. I have no doubt at all that he had left it there. Mr. and Mrs. Rucastle were both downstairs, and the child was with them, so that I had an admirable opportunity. I turned the key gently in the lock, opened the door, and slipped through.\n“There was a little passage in front of me, unpapered and uncarpeted, which turned at a right angle at the farther end. Round this corner were three doors in a line, the first and third of which were open. They each led into an empty room, dusty and cheerless, with two windows in the one and one in the other, so thick with dirt that the evening light glimmered dimly through them. The centre door was closed, and across the outside of it had been fastened one of the broad bars of an iron bed, padlocked at one end to a ring in the wall, and fastened at the other with stout cord. The door itself was locked as well, and the key was not there. This barricaded door corresponded clearly with the shuttered window outside, and yet I could see by the glimmer from beneath it that the room was not in darkness. Evidently there was a skylight which let in light from above. As I stood in the passage gazing at the sinister door and wondering what secret it might veil, I suddenly heard the sound of steps within the room and saw a shadow pass backward and forward against the little slit of dim light which shone out from under the door. A mad, unreasoning terror rose up in me at the sight, Mr. Holmes. My overstrung nerves failed me suddenly, and I turned and ran—ran as though some dreadful hand were behind me clutching at the skirt of my dress. I rushed down the passage, through the door, and straight into the arms of Mr. Rucastle, who was waiting outside.\n“‘So,’ said he, smiling, ‘it was you, then. I thought that it must be when I saw the door open.’\n“‘Oh, I am so frightened!’ I panted.\n“‘My dear young lady! my dear young lady!’—you cannot think how caressing and soothing his manner was—‘and what has frightened you, my dear young lady?’\n“But his voice was just a little too coaxing. He overdid it. I was keenly on my guard against him.\n“‘I was foolish enough to go into the empty wing,’ I answered. ‘But it is so lonely and eerie in this dim light that I was frightened and ran out again. Oh, it is so dreadfully still in there!’\n“‘Only that?’ said he, looking at me keenly.\n“‘Why, what did you think?’ I asked.\n“‘Why do you think that I lock this door?’\n“‘I am sure that I do not know.’\n“‘It is to keep people out who have no business there. Do you see?’ He was still smiling in the most amiable manner.\n“‘I am sure if I had known—’\n“‘Well, then, you know now. And if you ever put your foot over that threshold again’—here in an instant the smile hardened into a grin of rage, and he glared down at me with the face of a demon—‘I’ll throw you to the mastiff.’\n“I was so terrified that I do not know what I did. I suppose that I must have rushed past him into my room. I remember nothing until I found myself lying on my bed trembling all over. Then I thought of you, Mr. Holmes. I could not live there longer without some advice. I was frightened of the house, of the man, of the woman, of the servants, even of the child. They were all horrible to me. If I could only bring you down all would be well. Of course I might have fled from the house, but my curiosity was almost as strong as my fears. My mind was soon made up. I would send you a wire. I put on my hat and cloak, went down to the office, which is about half a mile from the house, and then returned, feeling very much easier. A horrible doubt came into my mind as I approached the door lest the dog might be loose, but I remembered that Toller had drunk himself into a state of insensibility that evening, and I knew that he was the only one in the household who had any influence with the savage creature, or who would venture to set him free. I slipped in in safety and lay awake half the night in my joy at the thought of seeing you. I had no difficulty in getting leave to come into Winchester this morning, but I must be back before three o’clock, for Mr. and Mrs. Rucastle are going on a visit, and will be away all the evening, so that I must look after the child. Now I have told you all my adventures, Mr. Holmes, and I should be very glad if you could tell me what it all means, and, above all, what I should do.”",

There were four of them in a row, three of which were simply dirty, while the fourth was shuttered up. They were evidently all deserted. As I strolled up and down, glancing at them occasionally, Mr. Rucastle came out to me, looking as merry and jovial as ever.\n\n\"Ah!\" said he, \"you must not think me rude if I passed you without a word, my dear young lady. I was preoccupied with business matters.\"\n\nI assured him that I was not offended. \"By the way,\" said I, \"you seem to have quite a suite of spare rooms up there, and one of them has the shutters up.\"\n\nHe looked surprised and, as it seemed to me, a little startled at my remark. \"Photography is one of my hobbies,\" said he. \"I have made my dark room up there. But, dear me! what an observant young lady we have come upon. Who would have believed it? Who would have ever believed it?\" He spoke in a jesting tone, but there was no jest in his eyes as he looked at me. I read suspicion there and annoyance, but no jest.\n\nIt was clear to me that I had said something which he did not like. We soon returned to the house, and he said nothing more about it. But the incident left a most unpleasant impression upon my mind.\n\nThe impression was increased by a little incident which occurred a few days later. I had occasion to go on some errand to the side of the house which I had not yet visited. As I turned the corner, I saw Toller, the red-faced servant, coming out of the door that led to the forbidden wing. He carried a large black bag in his hand, and he was slinking away as if he wished to avoid observation. He gave me a sullen nod and disappeared round the angle of the house.\n\nI approached the door, but it was shut and locked, as before. Then I made up my mind that, if ever I got a chance, I would explore that wing.\n\nIt was some time before the chance came. I am not sure that I ought to tell you the story, Mr. Holmes; it is a very strange one, and I have not confided it to anyone. But I know that I may trust you, and I felt that I must have advice. I have told you that the man Toller had been drunk the night before. He was so far gone that I had to get a servant from the village to help me put him to bed. His wife was ill, and could not attend to him. I went down to see if he was better in the morning, but he was still lying in a drunken sleep. The key of the door was in his pocket. I took it, with the object, of course, of returning it at once when I had explored the rooms. I went upstairs and unlocked the door. There was a little passage in front of me, leading to three doors. The first and third of these were open. They each led into an empty room, dusty and cheerless, with windows so thick with dirt that the light was hazy and uncertain. The center door was closed, and across it was a broad bar of iron, as broad as a man's hand, fastened to the wall by two padlocks. The door itself was locked as well, and the key was not there. Above the bar, a slit of light showed that there was a window above, so I could see that the room was not entirely dark.\n\nAs I stood there, pondering what I should do next, a shadow moved across the lighted slit, and I heard the sound of movement within. I shrank back, my heart beating wildly. Then I heard the sound of steps outside, and I turned to see Mr. Rucastle standing at the end of the passage. His face was as white as a sheet, and he was shaking with anger. He seized me by the wrist and led me downstairs. His grip was like iron, and he spoke in a low, coaxing voice, as if he were soothing a frightened child.\n\n\"My dear young lady,\" said he, \"what on earth are you doing here?\"\n\nI was so frightened that I could hardly speak. \"I was frightened, sir,\" I stammered. \"I heard a noise, and I could not help going up.\"\n\n\"Very well,\" said he, still in the same coaxing voice. \"You shall not be troubled again. I am responsible for your safety, and you shall not be annoyed by any noise from that wing.\"\n\nHe smiled as he spoke, and passed his hand over my head. But his smile was such as I could never forget. It was not the smile of a man, but of a fiend. \"If you ever set foot in that wing again,\" said he, in a low, menacing voice, \"I'll throw you to the mastiff.\"\n\nI was so terrified that I did not know what I did. I remember running out into the garden, and as soon as I was able, I went to the telegraph office and sent you the wire which you have received. That was the end of the matter, so far as I am concerned. I have not set foot in the forbidden wing again, nor do I intend to do so. But I am very uneasy about the whole affair, and I feel that I ought to have advice.

There was one wing, however, which appeared not to be inhabited at all. A door which faced that which led into the quarters of the Tollers opened into this suite, but it was invariably locked. One day, however, as I ascended the stair, I met Mr. Rucastle coming out through this door, his keys in his hand, and a look on his face which made him a very different person to the round, jovial man to whom I was accustomed.

            "prefix-probing": "There was a small garden at the back, but it was walled up, and the gate was only used for the tradespeople. Round the front ran a curved drive, which was banked with evergreens. It was a pretty, old-fashioned place, and I dare say that its atmosphere of peace and seclusion had a good deal to do with the strange events which occurred there. I had hardly entered the house before I was struck by the singular air of repression and constraint which seemed to pervade it. The servant who opened the door was a dour, silent man. The hall was large and high, and hung round with a number of old family portraits. I was shown into a small drawing-room, where my employer, Mr. Rucastle, was waiting for me. He was a man of about fifty, tall, portly, and with a heavy chin and a large, smiling mouth. His eyes were light blue, and he had a habit of blinking rapidly when he spoke. He welcomed me with effusion, and seemed anxious to put me at my ease.\n\n\"You will find, Miss Hunter,\" said he, \"that my wife and I will do all we can to make your stay a pleasant one. You have no doubt already formed some opinion as to the character of the house?\"\n\n\"I think it is a very pretty place,\" said I, \"and the grounds are charming.\"\n\n\"We are very quiet people, Miss Hunter. We do not go into society, nor do we see many visitors. My wife is an invalid, and we have to be very careful of her health.\"\n\nHe spoke in a low voice, as if he were afraid of being overheard. \"We have only one child, a little boy of six. My wife is devoted to him, and I am sure that you will find him a very interesting companion.\"\n\nI assured him that I should do my best to make myself useful, and he seemed pleased with my answer. He then rang the bell, and the dour servant reappeared.\n\n\"Ask Mrs. Rucastle to come down,\" said he.\n\nThe man went out, and presently returned with a lady who was evidently much younger than her husband. She was tall, slender, and very pale, with large, dark eyes and a sensitive mouth. She greeted me with a quiet dignity, and I could see that she was a woman of refinement and intelligence. She spoke little, but I could not help noticing the anxious, almost frightened, expression in her eyes.\n\nAfter a few minutes' conversation, Mr. Rucastle suggested that I should see the child. He led me up a broad staircase, and along a corridor to a nursery at the back of the house. The little boy was playing with some toys, and he looked up at me with a shy smile. He was a delicate, fair-haired child, with large blue eyes and a gentle manner. I took to him at once, and he seemed to like me.\n\nMy duties were soon explained to me. I was to take charge of the child, to amuse him, and to teach him as much as I could. I was also to help Mrs. Rucastle with her embroidery, and to read to her when she was well enough. The work was not hard, and the pay was excellent. I could not understand why they had found it so difficult to get a governess.\n\nFor the first few days, everything went smoothly. The child was affectionate and obedient, and Mrs. Rucastle seemed grateful for my help. Mr. Rucastle was always cheerful and good-humoured, but I could not shake off the feeling that there was something strange about the house. The servants were silent and reserved, and there was a sense of mystery in the air.\n\nOne day, as I was walking in the garden with the child, I noticed a window on the upper floor which was always shuttered. I asked the child about it, but he only shook his head and would not answer. I mentioned it to Mrs. Rucastle, but she changed the subject at once. I began to feel uneasy, and I resolved to keep my eyes open.\n\nA few nights later, I was awakened by a strange noise. I listened, and heard footsteps in the corridor outside my room. I got up and opened the door, but there was no one there. I went back to bed, but I could not sleep. The next morning, I found that the door of the shuttered room was ajar. I peeped in, but the room was empty. It was plainly furnished, with a bed, a table, and a chair. There was nothing to explain why it should be kept locked and shuttered.\n\nI became more and more convinced that there was some secret in the house. I watched Mr. Rucastle closely, and I noticed that he often went up to the shuttered room, and stayed there for some time. I also saw that Mrs. Rucastle was very nervous and unhappy. She seemed to be afraid of her husband, and she avoided being alone with him.\n\nOne afternoon, as I was sitting with Mrs. Rucastle, she suddenly burst into tears. She told me that she was very unhappy, and that she had no friends or relations. She begged me to stay with her, and not to leave her alone in the house. I promised to do so, and I tried to comfort her as best I could.\n\nThat night, I heard the strange noise again. This time, I crept out of my room and followed the sound. It led me to the shuttered room. I listened at the door, and I heard someone sobbing inside. I knocked, but there was no answer. I tried the handle, but the door was locked. I went back to my room, but I could not sleep for the rest of the night.\n\nThe next day, I resolved to speak to Mr. Rucastle. I asked him why the room was always locked, and who was in it. He looked at me with a strange expression, and told me that it was used for storing old furniture. He said that no one ever went into it, and that I was not to concern myself about it. I did not believe him, but I said nothing.\n\nA few days later, I received a letter from a friend in London, asking me to come and stay with her. I showed the letter to Mrs. Rucastle, and she begged me not to go. She said that she was afraid to be left alone with her husband. I promised her that I would stay, and I wrote to my friend to say that I could not come.\n\nThat night, I heard the strange noise again. This time, I was determined to find out the truth. I crept out of my room, and made my way to the shuttered room. I listened at the door, and I heard someone moving inside. I knocked, and a voice whispered, \"Who is there?\" I answered, \"It is I, Miss Hunter.\" The door was opened, and I saw a young woman standing in the room. She was pale and thin, with large, frightened eyes. She told me that she was Mr. Rucastle's daughter by his first wife, and that he kept her locked in the room because she had refused to marry a man whom he had chosen for her.\n\nI was horrified, and I promised to help her. I went back to my room, and the next day I wrote to you, Mr. Holmes, asking for your advice. That is the whole story as far as I know it.\""

My friend rose now and paced up and down the room, his hands in his pockets, and an expression of the most profound gravity upon his face.\n“Is Toller still drunk?” he asked.\n“Yes. I heard his wife tell Mrs. Rucastle that she could do nothing with him.”\n“That is well. And the Rucastles go out to-night?”\n“Yes.”\n“Is there a cellar with a good strong lock?”\n“Yes, the wine-cellar.”\n“You seem to me to have acted all through this matter like a very brave and sensible girl, Miss Hunter. Do you think that you could perform one more feat? I should not ask it of you if I did not think you a quite exceptional woman.”\n“I will try. What is it?”\n“We shall be at the Copper Beeches by seven o’clock, my friend and I. The Rucastles will be gone by that time, and Toller will, we hope, be incapable. There only remains Mrs. Toller, who might give the alarm. If you could send her into the cellar on some errand, and then turn the key upon her, you would facilitate matters immensely.”\n“I will do it.”\n“Excellent! We shall then look thoroughly into the affair. Of course there is only one feasible explanation. You have been brought there to personate someone, and the real person is imprisoned in this chamber. That is obvious. As to who this prisoner is, I have no doubt that it is the daughter, Miss Alice Rucastle, if I remember right, who was said to have gone to America. You were chosen, doubtless, as resembling her in height, figure, and the colour of your hair. Hers had been cut off, very possibly in some illness through which she has passed, and so, of course, yours had to be sacrificed also. By a curious chance you came upon her tresses. The man in the road was undoubtedly some friend of hers—possibly her fiancé—and no doubt, as you wore the girl’s dress and were so like her, he was convinced from your laughter, whenever he saw you, and afterwards from your gesture, that Miss Rucastle was perfectly happy, and that she no longer desired his attentions. The dog is let loose at night to prevent him from endeavouring to communicate with her. So much is fairly clear. The most serious point in the case is the disposition of the child.”\n“What on earth has that to do with it?” I ejaculated.\n“My dear Watson, you as a medical man are continually gaining light as to the tendencies of a child by the study of the parents. Don’t you see that the converse is equally valid. I have frequently gained my first real insight into the character of parents by studying their children. This child’s disposition is abnormally cruel, merely for cruelty’s sake, and whether he derives this from his smiling father, as I should suspect, or from his mother, it bodes evil for the poor girl who is in their power.”\n“I am sure that you are right, Mr. Holmes,” cried our client. “A thousand things come back to me which make me certain that you have hit it. Oh, let us lose not an instant in bringing help to this poor creature.”\n“We must be circumspect, for we are dealing with a very cunning man. We can do nothing until seven o’clock. At that hour we shall be with you, and it will not be long before we solve the mystery.”",

What is it?\"\n\n\"We shall be at the Copper Beeches by seven o'clock, my friend and I. The Rucastles will be gone by that time, and Toller will, we hope, be incapable. There only remains Mrs. Toller, who might give the alarm. If you could send her into the cellar on some errand, and then turn the key upon her, you would facilitate matters immensely.\"\n\n\"I will do it.\"\n\n\"Excellent! We shall then look thoroughly into the affair. Of course, there is only one explanation. You have been brought there to personate someone, and the real person is imprisoned in this chamber. That is obvious. As to who this prisoner is, I have no doubt that it is Miss Alice Rucastle, if I remember right, who was said to have gone to America. You were chosen, doubtless, as resembling her in height, figure, and the colour of your hair. Hers had been cut off, very possibly in some illness through which she has passed, and so, of course, yours had to be sacrificed also. By a curious chance you came upon her tresses. The man in the road was undoubtedly some friend of hers—possibly her fiancé—and no doubt, as you wore the girl's dress and were so like her, he was convinced from your laughter, whenever he saw you, and from the gesture of waving, that Miss Rucastle was perfectly happy and that she no longer desired his attentions. The dog is let loose at night to prevent him from endeavouring to communicate with her. So much is fairly clear. The most serious point in the case is the disposition of the child. What on earth has that to do with it?\" \"My dear Watson, you as a medical man are continually gaining light as to the tendencies of a child by the study of the parents. Don't you see that the singular conduct of the father and mother, the cruelty to the child, the secret imprisonment, are all indications of a most profound malignity? It bodes ill for the poor girl who is in their power.\"\n\n\"I am sure that you are right, Mr. Holmes,\" said our client. \"A thousand things come back to me which make me certain that you have hit upon the truth. Oh, let us lose not an instant in bringing help to this poor creature!\"\n\n\"We must be circumspect, for we are dealing with a very cunning man. We can do nothing until seven o'clock. At that hour we shall be with you, and if you will have the courage to do as I ask, I have no doubt that we shall soon set matters right.\"",
                "refinement_prompt": "IMPROVEMENT GUIDANCE:\n1. MAJOR STRUCTURAL ISSUES:\n- The completion introduces invented dialogue and actions at the beginning, such as Holmes asking about being armed, the mention of a revolver, and a discussion about returning by train. These do not appear in the original and shift the focus away from the actual plan being discussed.\n- The completion omits the original's initial exchange about Toller’s condition, the Rucastles’ plans for the evening, and the specifics about the wine-cellar, which are important for setting up the plan.\n\n2. MISSING ELEMENTS:\n- Early in the passage, the completion lacks the detailed questioning about Toller’s state, the Rucastles’ absence, and the presence of a locked cellar, all of which are crucial to the plan.\n- The specific instructions regarding sending Mrs. Toller into the cellar and locking her in are less detailed and miss the rationale provided in the original.\n- The original contains Holmes’s reasoning about the impersonation, the significance of the hair, and the man on the road, which are only partially covered in the completion. The explanation about the dog and its purpose is less clear and lacks the logical progression found in the original.\n- The discussion about the child’s disposition and its implications for the case is condensed and misses Holmes’s reasoning about inferring parental character from the child, as well as the medical perspective he shares with Watson.\n\n3. INACCURATE ELEMENTS:\n- The completion presents events out of order, such as discussing the revolver and travel plans before the actual plan for the evening is laid out.\n- Some attributions are incorrect, such as Miss Hunter’s response about Alice, which is not present in the original at this point.\n- The summary of Holmes’s deductions is less precise, with some logical steps either omitted or rearranged, and the explanation about the hair and the man on the road is less nuanced.\n- The urgency and reasoning behind the need for caution are present but lack the specific context and justification provided in the original.\n\nOverall, the completion would benefit from following the original sequence of planning, including all key details about the household members, the plan for the cellar, and Holmes’s step-by-step deductions, while avoiding invented dialogue and actions."

            "prefix-probing": "Holmes and I had listened spellbound to this extraordinary story. The firelight flickered over the earnest face of our visitor, and for a few moments there was complete silence in the room. Holmes leaned back in his chair, his long, thin fingers pressed together, his eyes half closed, as if in deep thought. I could see that he was turning over every detail in his mind, weighing each fact, and considering every possibility.\n\nAt last, he spoke. \"You have certainly had a remarkable experience, Mr. Holder,\" he said. \"Your narrative presents several points of interest, and I think we may hope to clear the matter up. But first, let me ask you a few questions.\"\n\nMr. Holder nodded eagerly. \"Anything, Mr. Holmes. I am at your disposal.\"\n\n\"You say that the beryl coronet was kept in your dressing-room, in a locked bureau?\"\n\n\"Yes, that is so.\"\n\n\"And only you and your son had access to the key?\"\n\n\"That is correct.\"\n\n\"And you are certain that the coronet was intact when you placed it in the bureau last night?\"\n\n\"Absolutely certain. I examined it myself before locking it away.\"\n\nHolmes drummed his fingers thoughtfully on the arm of his chair. \"And this morning, when you discovered the damage, what was your son's demeanor?\"\n\nMr. Holder hesitated. \"He seemed agitated, nervous. He denied all knowledge of the matter, but I could not help but suspect him.\"\n\n\"Did he offer any explanation for his behavior?\"\n\n\"None that satisfied me. He simply insisted that he knew nothing about it.\"\n\nHolmes nodded. \"And the servants? Did any of them have an opportunity to enter your dressing-room during the night?\"\n\n\"I do not think so. The house was locked and all were in their rooms.\"\n\n\"And your niece, Miss Mary?\"\n\nMr. Holder's face clouded. \"She is a good girl, Mr. Holmes. I cannot believe she would be involved.\"\n\nHolmes smiled gently. \"We must consider every possibility, Mr. Holder. Now, you mentioned that you heard a noise in the night?\"\n\n\"Yes, a slight clatter, as if something had fallen. It was this that roused me.\"\n\n\"And when you entered the dressing-room, what did you see?\"\n\n\"My son was standing by the bureau, the coronet in his hands. He seemed startled by my appearance.\"\n\nHolmes leaned forward, his eyes keen. \"And the window? Was it open or closed?\"\n\n\"Closed and fastened.\"\n\n\"And there were no signs of forced entry?\"\n\n\"None whatsoever.\"\n\nHolmes sat back, his expression thoughtful. \"Thank you, Mr. Holder. I believe I have all the information I need for the moment. Dr. Watson and I will call upon you at your house this afternoon. In the meantime, I would ask you to say nothing of our investigation to anyone.\"\n\nMr. Holder rose, his face showing a glimmer of hope. \"Thank you, Mr. Holmes. I shall await your visit.\"\n\nWhen he had gone, Holmes turned to me with a smile. \"Well, Watson, what do you make of it?\"\n\n\"It is a most singular case,\" I replied. \"The evidence seems to point to the son, but I cannot help but feel there is more to it.\"\n\n\"Precisely, my dear fellow. There are several curious features which do not fit the obvious explanation. We must keep an open mind. Come, let us prepare for our visit. I have a feeling that the solution to this mystery will not be long in coming.\""

Here are his keys, which are the duplicates of Mr. Rucastle’s.”\n“You have done well indeed!” cried Holmes with enthusiasm. “Now lead the way, and we shall soon see the end of this black business.”\nWe passed up the stair, unlocked the door, followed on down a passage, and found ourselves in front of the barricade which Miss Hunter had described. Holmes cut the cord and removed the transverse bar. Then he tried the various keys in the lock, but without success. No sound came from within, and at the silence Holmes’ face clouded over.\n“I trust that we are not too late,” said he. “I think, Miss Hunter, that we had better go in without you. Now, Watson, put your shoulder to it, and we shall see whether we cannot make our way in.”\nIt was an old rickety door and gave at once before our united strength. Together we rushed into the room. It was empty. There was no furniture save a little pallet bed, a small table, and a basketful of linen. The skylight above was open, and the prisoner gone.\n“There has been some villainy here,” said Holmes; “this beauty has guessed Miss Hunter’s intentions and has carried his victim off.”\n“But how?”\n“Through the skylight. We shall soon see how he managed it.” He swung himself up onto the roof. “Ah, yes,” he cried, “here’s the end of a long light ladder against the eaves. That is how he did it.”\n“But it is impossible,” said Miss Hunter; “the ladder was not there when the Rucastles went away.”\n“He has come back and done it. I tell you that he is a clever and dangerous man. I should not be very much surprised if this were he whose step I hear now upon the stair.

The Copper Beeches stood back from the road, surrounded by a high stone wall, with a pair of massive iron gates at the entrance. The drive wound through a grove of trees, their branches just beginning to show the tender green of early spring. As we passed through the gates, I could not help but notice the air of isolation and secrecy which seemed to hang over the place.\n\nViolet Hunter met us at the door, her face pale but composed. She greeted us quietly and led us into a small sitting-room, where she closed the door carefully behind us. Holmes glanced keenly at her, his eyes searching her face for any sign of distress.\n\n\"You have news for us, Miss Hunter?\" he asked.\n\n\"Yes, Mr. Holmes. I have done as you advised. I have kept my eyes open, and I have discovered something very strange.\"\n\nShe lowered her voice and leaned forward. \"Last night, after everyone had gone to bed, I crept down the corridor and listened at the door of the room at the far end—the one I told you about. I heard a faint sound, as if someone were moving inside. I waited, but the sound ceased, and I dared not linger longer.\"\n\nHolmes nodded. \"You have done well. And today?\"\n\n\"This morning, Mr. Rucastle asked me to wear the blue dress again and to sit in the window as before. I did so, but I noticed that he watched me closely, and when I tried to look out, he became agitated and told me to keep my eyes on my work.\"\n\n\"Very curious,\" Holmes murmured. \"And the child?\"\n\n\"He is as wild as ever. He bit me this morning.\"\n\nHolmes smiled grimly. \"We must act tonight. Miss Hunter, you will retire to your room as usual. Dr. Watson and I will conceal ourselves in the shrubbery outside. If you hear any commotion, do not be alarmed. We shall be at hand.\"\n\nViolet Hunter nodded bravely. As the sun set behind the copper beeches, we took up our positions, ready for whatever the night might bring."

Mr. Rucastle let me out when he came back before he went up to you. Ah, miss, it is a pity you didn’t let me know what you were planning, for I would have told you that your pains were wasted.”\n“Ha!” said Holmes, looking keenly at her. “It is clear that Mrs. Toller knows more about this matter than anyone else.”\n“Yes, sir, I do, and I am ready enough to tell what I know.”\n“Then, pray, sit down, and let us hear it for there are several points on which I must confess that I am still in the dark.”\n“I will soon make it clear to you,” said she; “and I’d have done so before now if I could ha’ got out from the cellar. If there’s police-court business over this, you’ll remember that I was the one that stood your friend, and that I was Miss Alice’s friend too.\n“She was never happy at home, Miss Alice wasn’t, from the time that her father married again. She was slighted like and had no say in anything, but it never really became bad for her until after she met Mr. Fowler at a friend’s house. As well as I could learn, Miss Alice had rights of her own by will, but she was so quiet and patient, she was, that she never said a word about them but just left everything in Mr. Rucastle’s hands. He knew he was safe with her; but when there was a chance of a husband coming forward, who would ask for all that the law would give him, then her father thought it time to put a stop on it. He wanted her to sign a paper, so that whether she married or not, he could use her money. When she wouldn’t do it, he kept on worrying her until she got brain-fever, and for six weeks was at death’s door. Then she got better at last, all worn to a shadow, and with her beautiful hair cut off; but that didn’t make no change in her young man, and he stuck to her as true as man could be.”\n“Ah,” said Holmes, “I think that what you have been good enough to tell us makes the matter fairly clear, and that I can deduce all that remains. Mr. Rucastle then, I presume, took to this system of imprisonment?”\n“Yes, sir.”\n“And brought Miss Hunter down from London in order to get rid of the disagreeable persistence of Mr. Fowler.”\n“That was it, sir.”\n“But Mr. Fowler being a persevering man, as a good seaman should be, blockaded the house, and having met you succeeded by certain arguments, metallic or otherwise, in convincing you that your interests were the same as his.”\n“Mr. Fowler was a very kind-spoken, free-handed gentleman,” said Mrs. Toller serenely.\n“And in this way he managed that your good man should have no want of drink, and that a ladder should be ready at the moment when your master had gone out.”\n“You have it, sir, just as it happened.”\n“I am sure we owe you an apology, Mrs. Toller,” said Holmes, “for you have certainly cleared up everything which puzzled us. And here comes the country surgeon and Mrs. Rucastle, so I think, Watson, that we had best escort Miss Hunter back to Winchester, as it seems to me that our locus standi now is rather a questionable one.”\nAnd thus was solved the mystery of the sinister house with the copper beeches in front of the door. Mr. Rucastle survived, but was always a broken man, kept alive solely through the care of his devoted wife. They still live with their old servants, who probably know so much of Rucastle’s past life that he finds it difficult to part from them. Mr. Fowler and Miss Rucastle were married, by special license, in Southampton the day after their flight, and he is now the holder of a government appointment in the island of Mauritius.

Well, sir, as soon as she was able to look about her, Mr. Fowler came again, and it was arranged that they should be married. He would have taken her away then and there, but Mr. Rucastle was so cunning that he kept her in the house, and would not let her see anyone.

MAJOR STRUCTURAL ISSUES:\n- The completion omits a significant portion of Mrs. Toller's detailed explanation regarding Miss Alice's situation, her relationship with her father, and the events leading up to her illness and confinement. This section is crucial for understanding the motivations and background of the characters.\n- The dialogue between Holmes and Mrs. Toller is condensed, and several exchanges that clarify the sequence of events and Holmes's deductions are missing.\n\n2. MISSING ELEMENTS:\n- Early in the passage, Mrs. Toller's willingness to share information and her reference to being locked in the cellar are not fully developed.\n- The original includes Mrs. Toller's account of Miss Alice's unhappiness, her father's remarriage, her rights by will, and the pressure to sign over her inheritance. These details are absent in the completion.\n- The description of Alice's illness, her recovery, and the steadfastness of Mr. Fowler is not present.\n- Holmes's step-by-step deductions about the imprisonment and the involvement of Miss Hunter are largely skipped.\n- The original's closing summary provides specific details about the fates of the main characters, including the manner and location of Alice's marriage and Mr. Fowler's new position, which are only partially addressed in the completion.\n\n3. INACCURATE ELEMENTS:\n- The completion introduces invented dialogue, such as Mrs. Toller mentioning a monetary reward and Holmes apologizing for locking her up, which are not present in the original.\n- The sequence of events is altered: the explanation of Mrs. Toller's actions and motivations is presented before Holmes's deductions, rather than following his questions and clarifications.\n- The completion inaccurately attributes the arrangement of the ladder and the intoxication of Mr. Toller directly to Mrs. Toller, whereas the original presents these details differently.\n- The summary of the characters' outcomes is less precise, with some locations and roles generalized or inaccurately described.\n- The transition to the conclusion is abrupt and omits the reflective tone and narrative closure found in the original."

Her movements were slow and stately, and her presence seemed to bring a hush upon the little group gathered in the chamber. Holmes, who had been lounging in an armchair with his long, thin fingers pressed together, sat up at once, his keen eyes fixed upon the newcomer.\n\n\"You sent for me?\" she asked, her voice low and tremulous, yet with a certain underlying strength.\n\n\"Yes, madam,\" Holmes replied, rising to his feet. \"Pray be seated. We have some questions which only you can answer.\"\n\nShe moved to the chair indicated by Holmes and sat down, her hands folded in her lap. For a moment, she seemed to gather her thoughts, and then she raised her veil, revealing a pale, careworn face, with deep-set eyes that spoke of sleepless nights and anxious days.\n\n\"I am at your service, Mr. Holmes,\" she said quietly. \"I trust you will be able to help me.\"\n\nHolmes inclined his head. \"We shall do our utmost, madam. But first, I must ask you to recount, in your own words, the events of last night.\"\n\nShe drew a deep breath. \"It is not easy for me to speak of it, but I will try. My husband and I had retired early, for he had been unwell of late. I was awakened in the night by a strange sound—a sort of tapping at the window. At first, I thought it was the wind, but then I heard it again, more insistent. I rose and went to the window, but could see nothing in the darkness.\"\n\nShe paused, her hands trembling slightly. Holmes watched her intently, his expression unreadable.\n\n\"Did you wake your husband?\" he asked gently.\n\n\"No, he was sleeping so soundly, I did not wish to disturb him. I returned to bed, but I could not sleep. The tapping came again, and this time I was certain it was not the wind. I lit a candle and went once more to the window. As I drew back the curtain, I saw a face pressed against the glass—a pale, ghastly face, with wild eyes staring in at me.\"\n\nA shudder ran through the room. Even Holmes seemed momentarily taken aback.\n\n\"What did you do then?\" he asked.\n\n\"I cried out, and the face vanished. My husband awoke at my scream, and together we searched the grounds, but found nothing. There were no footprints, no sign that anyone had been there. It was as if the apparition had melted into the night.\"\n\nHolmes was silent for a moment, his brows knitted in thought. \"And you are certain it was a human face you saw?\"\n\nShe nodded. \"I am sure of it. I shall never forget those eyes.\"\n\n\"Did you notice anything else? Any sound, any movement?\"\n\n\"No, only the tapping and the face.\"\n\nHolmes turned to me. \"What do you make of it, Watson?\"\n\nI shook my head. \"It is most mysterious.\"\n\nHolmes smiled faintly. \"Indeed. But mysteries are our business, are they not?\"\n\nHe turned back to the woman. \"Madam, I must ask you to remain calm. We shall investigate this matter thoroughly. In the meantime, I would advise you to keep your windows securely fastened and to admit no one to the house without your knowledge.\"\n\nShe inclined her head. \"Thank you, Mr. Holmes. I feel safer already, knowing that you are on the case.\"\n\nWith a final, grateful glance, she rose and left the room, her black dress trailing behind her.\n\nHolmes waited until the door had closed before turning to me. \"Well, Watson, what do you think?\"\n\n\"It is a most singular case,\" I replied. \"Do you believe her story?\"\n\n\"I have no reason to doubt her sincerity,\" Holmes said thoughtfully. \"But there are elements here which do not fit the usual pattern. The absence of footprints, for example. And the tapping at the window—what could have caused it?\"\n\nHe rose and began to pace the room, his hands clasped behind his back. \"We must visit the scene at once. There may be clues which have escaped notice.\"\n\nI nodded, and together we prepared to set out, eager to unravel the mystery that had so disturbed the household. As we left the room, I could not help but feel a thrill of anticipation. For in the presence of Sherlock Holmes, even the most baffling of puzzles seemed destined to yield their secrets."
