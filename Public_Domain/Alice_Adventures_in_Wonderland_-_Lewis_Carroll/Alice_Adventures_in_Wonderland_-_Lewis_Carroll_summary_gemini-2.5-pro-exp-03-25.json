Oh dear! I shall be late!” (when she thought it over afterwards, it occurred to her that she ought to have wondered at this, but at the time it all seemed quite natural); but when the Rabbit actually took a watch out of its waistcoat-pocket, and looked at it, and then hurried on, Alice started to her feet, for it flashed across her mind that she had never before seen a rabbit with either a waistcoat-pocket, or a watch to take out of it, and burning with curiosity, she ran across the field after it, and fortunately was just in time to see it pop down a large rabbit-hole under the hedge.\nIn another moment down went Alice after it, never once considering how in the world she was to get out again.",

She had peeked into her sister's book but found it lacked pictures or dialogue, making her wonder, 'What's the point of a book without pictures or conversations?' Because the warm weather made her feel drowsy and a bit slow, she was considering whether making a daisy-chain would be worth the effort of getting up to pick the flowers. Suddenly, a White Rabbit with pink eyes scurried past her. Alice didn't find this particularly extraordinary, nor did she think it too odd when she heard the Rabbit mutter, 'Oh dear! Oh dear! I shall be late!' (Reflecting on it later, she realized how strange this was, but at the moment, it seemed perfectly normal). However, when the Rabbit actually took a watch from a pocket in its waistcoat, looked at it, and then hurried off, Alice leaped up. It struck her that she had never before seen a rabbit with a waistcoat-pocket or a watch. Burning with curiosity, she chased it across the field and just managed to see it disappear down a large rabbit-hole under the hedge. Without a moment's hesitation or a thought about how she would ever get back out, Alice followed it down the hole.",

She glanced into her sister's book now and then, but since it lacked illustrations or dialogues, Alice wondered what purpose a book could serve without them. Feeling sluggish and a little drowsy in the heat, she pondered whether it would be worth the effort to pick daisies for a flower chain. Suddenly, she noticed a White Rabbit with pink eyes running nearby. At first, this didn’t seem unusual to Alice, nor did the fact that the Rabbit spoke to itself, worrying about being late—although, in retrospect, she realized that might have been odd. It was only when the Rabbit pulled out a watch from its waistcoat pocket and checked the time that Alice leapt up in surprise, realizing she had never before seen a rabbit with such things. Driven by curiosity, she chased after the Rabbit, managing to see it quickly dive into a large hole beneath the hedge. Without giving any thought to how she might get back out, Alice immediately followed the Rabbit down the hole."

Why, I wouldn’t say anything about it, even if I fell off the top of the house!” (Which was very likely true.)\nDown, down, down. Would the fall never come to an end? “I wonder how many miles I’ve fallen by this time?” she said aloud. “I must be getting somewhere near the centre of the earth. Let me see: that would be four thousand miles down, I think—” (for, you see, Alice had learnt several things of this sort in her lessons in the schoolroom, and though this was not a very good opportunity for showing off her knowledge, as there was no one to listen to her, still it was good practice to say it over) “—yes, that’s about the right distance—but then I wonder what Latitude or Longitude I’ve got to?” (Alice had no idea what Latitude was, or Longitude either, but thought they were nice grand words to say.)\nPresently she began again. “I wonder if I shall fall right through the earth! How funny it’ll seem to come out among the people that walk with their heads downward! The Antipathies, I think—” (she was rather glad there was no one listening, this time, as it didn’t sound at all the right word) “—but I shall have to ask them what the name of the country is, you know. Please, Ma’am, is this New Zealand or Australia?” (and she tried to curtsey as she spoke—fancy curtseying as you’re falling through the air! Do you think you could manage it?) “And what an ignorant little girl she’ll think me for asking! No, it’ll never do to ask: perhaps I shall see it written up somewhere.”\nDown, down, down. There was nothing else to do, so Alice soon began talking again. “Dinah’ll miss me very much to-night, I should think!” (Dinah was the cat.) “I hope they’ll remember her saucer of milk at tea-time. Dinah my dear! I wish you were down here with me! There are no mice in the air, I’m afraid, but you might catch a bat, and that’s very like a mouse, you know. But do cats eat bats, I wonder?” And here Alice began to get rather sleepy, and went on saying to herself, in a dreamy sort of way, “Do cats eat bats? Do cats eat bats?” and sometimes, “Do bats eat cats?” for, you see, as she couldn’t answer either question, it didn’t much matter which way she put it. She felt that she was dozing off, and had just begun to dream that she was walking hand in hand with Dinah, and saying to her very earnestly, “Now, Dinah, tell me the truth: did you ever eat a bat?” when suddenly, thump! thump! down she came upon a heap of sticks and dry leaves, and the fall was over.",
          "paraphrase_gemini-2.5-flash-preview-04-17": "Alice reflected that after such a significant drop, falling down stairs would seem like nothing. She imagined how impressed her family would be with her courage back home, deciding she wouldn't even mention it if she had tumbled from the roof of the house (which was quite plausible). The downward descent continued seemingly without end. Wondering how far she had traveled by now, she vocalized her thought, estimating she must be nearing the Earth's core. Based on her school lessons, she calculated this would be about four thousand miles down. Although there was no one present to impress with her learning, she found it useful to vocalize the information. She confirmed the approximate distance but then pondered her geographical coordinates, Latitude and Longitude, terms she liked the sound of despite not knowing their meaning. She then speculated about falling completely through the Earth, picturing the humorous scenario of emerging among people who walked with their heads down, referring to them incorrectly as 'Antipathies'. She was relieved no one heard her misuse the word this time. She anticipated needing to ask these people about their country, imagining herself curtsying mid-air while asking, 'Excuse me, is this New Zealand or Australia?' (a curtsy during a fall seeming quite challenging). She realized they would think her ignorant for asking and decided against it, hoping to find the location written down instead. The fall persisted, with nothing else to occupy her, so Alice resumed talking. She expressed concern for her cat, Dinah, predicting Dinah would miss her greatly that evening and hoping someone would remember her milk at tea-time. She wished Dinah were with her, noting the absence of mice in the air but suggesting a bat might be a comparable catch. This led her to question whether cats eat bats. Growing tired, Alice began repeating the phrase dreamily, sometimes switching it around. Since she couldn't answer, the phrasing didn't matter. Feeling herself drifting off to sleep, she started dreaming she was holding Dinah's paw, earnestly asking if Dinah had ever eaten a bat. Suddenly, with a jolt, she landed on a pile of dry leaves and sticks, and her fall was over.",
          "paraphrase_gpt-4.1-2025-04-14": "Alice thought to herself, \"After falling such a long way, tumbling down the stairs at home will seem like nothing! Everyone will think I'm so courageous! I wouldn’t even mention it, even if I fell off the roof!\" (which was probably true). Down she kept falling. Would it ever stop? “I wonder how far I’ve fallen by now?” she said out loud. “Maybe I’m getting close to the earth’s center. Let me think: that should be about four thousand miles deep—” (Alice had learned a few things like this in school, and although nobody was around to hear her, she still liked to practice saying them) “—yes, that’s the distance, but now I wonder what my Latitude or Longitude is?” (Though truthfully, Alice didn’t really know what those meant; she just liked the impressive names.)\n\nShe continued, “I wonder if I’m going to fall right through the earth! It would be odd to come out where people walk with their heads down! The Antipathies, I think—” (she was glad no one heard her, as that word wasn’t quite right) “—but I’ll have to ask them the name of the country. Excuse me, ma’am, is this New Zealand or Australia?” (She even tried to curtsey while she was falling—imagine trying to curtsey as you’re falling through the air! Could you do it?) “And she’ll think I’m silly for asking! No, I mustn’t ask; maybe I’ll see a sign somewhere.”\n\nDown and down she fell. With nothing else to do, Alice started talking again. “Dinah will miss me tonight, I bet!” (Dinah was her cat.) “I hope they remember to give her milk at teatime. Oh Dinah, I wish you were here with me! There aren’t any mice in the air, but maybe you could catch a bat—it’s sort of like a mouse, right? But do cats eat bats?” Suddenly Alice began to feel sleepy, mumbling dreamily, “Do cats eat bats? Do cats eat bats?” and sometimes, “Do bats eat cats?” Since she couldn’t answer either question, it didn’t matter how she asked. She felt herself drifting off to sleep and started to dream she was walking hand-in-hand with Dinah and asking her, very seriously, “Now, Dinah, tell me honestly: have you ever eaten a bat?” Suddenly—thump! thump!—she landed on a pile of sticks and dry leaves, and her long fall was finally over."

She had never forgotten that drinking much from a bottle labeled “poison” is almost guaranteed to have negative consequences eventually.

Although the label instructed her to drink, careful Alice wasn’t about to do so hastily. \"I’ll check first,\" she thought, wanting to see if it was marked 'poison', since she remembered all the stories about children who got hurt or eaten because they forgot basic safety rules—like that a hot poker can burn you, or that a deep knife cut will bleed, and especially, that bottles labeled 'poison' should not be drunk from. Since there was no poison warning on this bottle, Alice decided to try it and found the taste delightful—a blend of cherry tart, custard, pineapple, roast turkey, toffee, and hot buttered toast—so delightful, in fact, that she quickly drank it all."

I almost think I can remember feeling a little different. But if I’m not the same, the next question is, Who in the world am I? Ah, that’s the great puzzle!” And she began thinking over all the children she knew that were of the same age as herself, to see if she could have been changed for any of them.\n“I’m sure I’m not Ada,” she said, “for her hair goes in such long ringlets, and mine doesn’t go in ringlets at all; and I’m sure I can’t be Mabel, for I know all sorts of things, and she, oh! she knows such a very little! Besides, she’s she, and I’m I, and—oh dear, how puzzling it all is! I’ll try if I know all the things I used to know. Let me see: four times five is twelve, and four times six is thirteen, and four times seven is—oh dear! I shall never get to twenty at that rate! However, the Multiplication Table doesn’t signify: let’s try Geography. London is the capital of Paris, and Paris is the capital of Rome, and Rome—no, that’s all wrong, I’m certain! I must have been changed for Mabel! I’ll try and say ‘How doth the little—’” and she crossed her hands on her lap as if she were saying lessons, and began to repeat it, but her voice sounded hoarse and strange, and the words did not come the same as they used to do:—\n“How doth the little crocodile\n    Improve his shining tail,\nAnd pour the waters of the Nile\n    On every golden scale!\n\n“How cheerfully he seems to grin,\n    How neatly spread his claws,\nAnd welcome little fishes in\n    With gently smiling jaws!”\n“I’m sure those are not the right words,” said poor Alice, and her eyes filled with tears again as she went on, “I must be Mabel after all, and I shall have to go and live in that poky little house, and have next to no toys to play with, and oh! ever so many lessons to learn! No, I’ve made up my mind about it; if I’m Mabel, I’ll stay down here! It’ll be no use their putting their heads down and saying ‘Come up again, dear!’ I shall only look up and say ‘Who am I then? Tell me that first, and then, if I like being that person, I’ll come up: if not, I’ll stay down here till I’m somebody else’—but, oh dear!” cried Alice, with a sudden burst of tears, “I do wish they would put their heads down!

Talking to herself, she remarked how peculiar everything was today, so unlike yesterday. She wondered if she had undergone a change during the night. Trying to remember, she felt she might have sensed a slight difference upon waking. If she wasn't the same person, the big question was, who was she? This was truly puzzling. She started thinking about all the girls she knew who were her age, considering if she might have been swapped with one of them. She was sure she wasn't Ada, because Ada had long ringlets, which her hair didn't have. She was also certain she couldn't be Mabel, as she herself knew many things, while Mabel knew very little. Besides, she reasoned, Mabel was Mabel, and she was herself, and the whole thing was terribly confusing. She decided to test if she still knew the facts she used to. She tried arithmetic: four times five was twelve, and four times six was thirteen, and four times seven... She despaired, realizing she wouldn't even reach twenty at this speed, but decided the multiplication table didn't matter. She tried Geography next: London was the capital of Paris, and Paris was the capital of Rome... No, she was sure that was completely wrong! She concluded with certainty that she must have been changed into Mabel. She decided to try saying a poem, putting her hands together on her lap as if she were practicing lessons. When she began, her voice sounded rough and strange, and the words that came out were not the ones she expected: it was the poem about the little crocodile improving his tail and pouring Nile water on his scales, grinning and spreading his claws neatly to welcome little fish. 'I'm sure those aren't the correct words,' said a tearful Alice, her eyes filling up again. She continued, believing she must indeed be Mabel after all. This meant she would have to live in that tiny house, with almost no toys and endless lessons. But she immediately made up her mind: if she was Mabel, she would stay right there. They could call down 'Come up again, dear!' but she would just look up and ask, 'Who am I then? Tell me that first, and then if I like being that person, I'll come up: if not, I'll stay down here until I'm somebody else.'

I feel like I remember feeling a bit different. But if I’m not the same person, then who am I? That’s the real mystery!\" She started considering all the other children she knew who were about her age to figure out if she could have become one of them instead. \"I can’t be Ada,\" she said, \"her hair is all in long curls, while mine isn’t curly at all; and I definitely can’t be Mabel, because I know all kinds of things, and she knows very little! Plus, she’s herself and I’m me—oh, it’s all so confusing! Perhaps I should check if I still remember what I used to know. Let’s see: four times five is twelve, four times six is thirteen, and four times seven is—oh no! I’ll never reach twenty like this! But maybe the multiplication table doesn’t matter; let’s try geography. London is the capital of Paris, Paris is the capital of Rome, and Rome—no, that can’t be right! I must have turned into Mabel!

Everything is so out-of-the-way down here, that I should think very likely it can talk: at any rate, there’s no harm in trying.” So she began: “O Mouse, do you know the way out of this pool? I am very tired of swimming about here, O Mouse!” (Alice thought this must be the right way of speaking to a mouse: she had never done such a thing before, but she remembered having seen in her brother’s Latin Grammar, “A mouse—of a mouse—to a mouse—a mouse—O mouse!”) The Mouse looked at her rather inquisitively, and seemed to her to wink with one of its little eyes, but it said nothing.\n“Perhaps it doesn’t understand English,” thought Alice; “I daresay it’s a French mouse, come over with William the Conqueror.” (For, with all her knowledge of history, Alice had no very clear notion how long ago anything had happened.) So she began again: “Où est ma chatte?” which was the first sentence in her French lesson-book. The Mouse gave a sudden leap out of the water, and seemed to quiver all over with fright. “Oh, I beg your pardon!” cried Alice hastily, afraid that she had hurt the poor animal’s feelings. “I quite forgot you didn’t like cats.”\n“Not like cats!” cried the Mouse, in a shrill, passionate voice. “Would you like cats if you were me?”\n“Well, perhaps not,” said Alice in a soothing tone: “don’t be angry about it. And yet I wish I could show you our cat Dinah: I think you’d take a fancy to cats if you could only see her. She is such a dear quiet thing,” Alice went on, half to herself, as she swam lazily about in the pool, “and she sits purring so nicely by the fire, licking her paws and washing her face—and she is such a nice soft thing to nurse—and she’s such a capital one for catching mice—oh, I beg your pardon!” cried Alice again, for this time the Mouse was bristling all over, and she felt certain it must be really offended. “We won’t talk about her any more if you’d rather not.”\n“We indeed!” cried the Mouse, who was trembling down to the end of his tail. “As if I would talk on such a subject! Our family always hated cats: nasty, low, vulgar things! Don’t let me hear the name again!”\n“I won’t indeed!” said Alice, in a great hurry to change the subject of conversation. “Are you—are you fond—of—of dogs?” The Mouse did not answer, so Alice went on eagerly: “There is such a nice little dog near our house I should like to show you! A little bright-eyed terrier, you know, with oh, such long curly brown hair! And it’ll fetch things when you throw them, and it’ll sit up and beg for its dinner, and all sorts of things—I can’t remember half of them—and it belongs to a farmer, you know, and he says it’s so useful, it’s worth a hundred pounds! He says it kills all the rats and—oh dear!” cried Alice in a sorrowful tone, “I’m afraid I’ve offended it again!” For the Mouse was swimming away from her as hard as it could go, and making quite a commotion in the pool as it went.",
          "paraphrase_gemini-2.5-flash-preview-04-17": "Just then, Alice heard a splashing noise nearby in the water and swam closer to identify it. She first thought it was a large sea creature like a walrus or hippopotamus, but then remembered how small she was and realized it was only a mouse, who had also fallen in. Wondering if it would be helpful, Alice considered speaking to the mouse, thinking that given the strange circumstances, it might be able to talk. She decided there was no harm in trying. So, she addressed it, saying, \"Oh Mouse, do you know how to get out of this pool? I'm very tired of swimming here.\" (Alice thought this was the correct way to speak to a mouse, recalling a pattern from her brother's Latin Grammar book.) The Mouse looked at her curiously and seemed to blink one eye but didn't respond. Alice then wondered if it didn't understand English, perhaps being a French mouse that arrived with William the Conqueror (though her historical knowledge was hazy). She tried again, using the first sentence from her French lesson book: \"Où est ma chatte?\" (Where is my cat?). The Mouse suddenly leaped out of the water, visibly shaking with fear. Realizing she had likely upset the animal, Alice quickly apologized, saying she forgot the mouse disliked cats. The Mouse, in a high-pitched, emotional voice, retorted, \"Dislike cats! Would *you* like cats if you were me?\" Alice responded gently, \"Well, perhaps not,\" urging it not to be angry. She then expressed a wish to show the Mouse her own cat, Dinah, suggesting the Mouse might change its mind if it saw her. Alice continued describing Dinah as a quiet, purring, soft creature good for cuddling, who also happened to be excellent at catching mice. She immediately regretted her words, crying out another apology as the Mouse's fur bristled all over, confirming it was truly offended. Alice quickly promised not to mention Dinah again if the Mouse preferred. \"We indeed!\" cried the Mouse, trembling all the way to its tail. \"As if *I* would discuss such a topic! My family has always *detested* cats—nasty, common, awful things! Don't let me hear that name again!\" Eager to change the subject, Alice quickly asked if it was fond of dogs. The Mouse remained silent, so Alice eagerly continued, describing a small, bright-eyed terrier near her house that she wanted to show it. She rattled off its qualities: long curly brown hair, fetching things, begging for food, and being so useful at killing rats that its farmer owner considered it worth a lot of money. \"Oh dear!\" Alice exclaimed sadly, realizing she had offended it again. The Mouse was swimming away from her as fast as it could, creating a significant splash in the pool.",
          "paraphrase_gpt-4.1-2025-04-14": "At that moment, Alice heard splashing a short distance away in the pool. Curious, she swam closer to see what was causing the noise. At first, she thought it might be a large animal like a walrus or hippopotamus, but then realized she herself was very small now. Soon, she saw that it was only a mouse who, like her, had fallen into the water. \n\nAlice wondered if it would be worthwhile to talk to the mouse, since everything here was so strange that perhaps the mouse could speak. Deciding there was nothing to lose by trying, she addressed it: “O Mouse, do you know the way out of this pool? I’m very tired of swimming here, O Mouse!” Alice thought this was the right way to speak to a mouse, remembering from her brother’s Latin grammar book phrases like, “A mouse—of a mouse—to a mouse—a mouse—O mouse!” The mouse looked at her curiously, and seemed to wink with one eye, but didn’t say anything.\n\nAlice thought maybe the mouse didn’t understand English, and considered it might be a French mouse that came over during William the Conqueror’s time, though she wasn’t sure exactly how long ago that was. She tried her French: “Où est ma chatte?” (Where is my cat?), the first sentence she had learned from her French lesson-book. The Mouse jumped out of the water in fright, trembling all over. “Oh, I’m sorry!” Alice exclaimed, worried that she had upset the mouse. “I forgot you didn’t like cats.”\n\n“Not like cats!” the Mouse replied in a high, passionate voice. “Would you like cats if you were me?”\n\n“Probably not,” said Alice soothingly. “Don’t be upset. Still, I wish you could see our cat Dinah; maybe you’d like cats if you met her. She’s so gentle and quiet,” Alice said dreamily, continuing to swim lazily, “she sits by the fire purring, licking her paws and washing her face, and she’s so soft and nice to hold. She’s also very good at catching mice—oh, I’m so sorry!” Alice cried again, noticing the mouse bristling and looking very offended. “Let’s not talk about her anymore if you’d prefer.”\n\n“We indeed!” retorted the Mouse, trembling all the way to the tip of its tail. “As if I would want to discuss such a topic! Cats are disgusting, nasty creatures! Don’t mention them around me again!”\n\n“Of course not!” said Alice quickly, eager to switch topics. “Do you—do you like—dogs?” The Mouse didn’t respond, so Alice went on, “There’s a lovely little dog near our house I wish I could show you! It’s a bright-eyed terrier, with long, curly brown hair. It can retrieve things, beg for food, and do all sorts of tricks—I can’t remember them all. It belongs to a farmer who says it’s so useful, it’s worth a hundred pounds! He says it catches all the rats and—oh dear!” Alice exclaimed sadly, realizing she had likely offended the mouse again, as it swam away from her quickly, making quite a disturbance in the water."

Indeed, she had quite a long argument with the Lory, who at last turned sulky, and would only say, “I am older than you, and must know better;” and this Alice would not allow without knowing how old it was, and, as the Lory positively refused to tell its age, there was no more to be said.\nAt last the Mouse, who seemed to be a person of authority among them, called out, “Sit down, all of you, and listen to me! I’ll soon make you dry enough!” They all sat down at once, in a large ring, with the Mouse in the middle. Alice kept her eyes anxiously fixed on it, for she felt sure she would catch a bad cold if she did not get dry very soon.\n“Ahem!” said the Mouse with an important air, “are you all ready? This is the driest thing I know. Silence all round, if you please! ‘William the Conqueror, whose cause was favoured by the pope, was soon submitted to by the English, who wanted leaders, and had been of late much accustomed to usurpation and conquest.

Their most immediate concern was how to get dry again. They held a meeting about it, and within minutes, it struck Alice as completely natural that she was talking freely with them, as if they had been lifelong acquaintances. In fact, she had a significant disagreement with the Lory, who eventually became moody and would only repeat, 'I am older than you, and therefore know better.' Alice refused to accept this without knowing the Lory's age, and since the Lory flatly refused to reveal it, the conversation ended. Finally, the Mouse, who seemed to be the leader among them, announced loudly, 'Everyone, sit down and pay attention! I will quickly make you dry enough!'

Eventually, after about half an hour, once everyone was dry again, the Dodo suddenly declared, “The race is over!” Everyone gathered around it, out of breath, asking who had won.\n\nThe Dodo couldn’t answer right away—it had to think for a long while, striking a thoughtful pose, reminiscent of Shakespeare’s portraits, as everyone waited. Finally, it announced, “Everyone has won, so everyone must get a prize!”\n\nA chorus immediately asked who would hand out the prizes. “Why, Alice of course,” said the Dodo, pointing at her. The whole group crowded around Alice demanding prizes. Unsure what to do, Alice reached into her pocket in desperation and pulled out a box of candies (luckily, they hadn’t been ruined by the sea), and distributed one to each participant.\n\n“However, she must have a prize, too,” said the Mouse. The Dodo agreed, and asked Alice what else she had. Sadly, she replied that she only had a thimble. The Dodo took it from her and presented it back to her with a solemn little speech, asking her to accept it. Everyone cheered at the conclusion. Alice thought the entire episode ridiculous, but since everyone else was so serious, she didn’t dare laugh, so she just bowed and took the thimble, acting as formally as she could."

This created quite a commotion, as the larger birds complained about not being able to taste them, and the smaller ones gagged, requiring pats on the back. Eventually, it was over, and they resumed their places in a circle, asking the Mouse to share more. Alice reminded the Mouse, 'You did promise to tell me your history, you know,' adding in a hushed tone, 'and why you dislike - C and D,' afraid of causing offense again. With a sigh, the Mouse turned to Alice and declared, 'My story is a long and sorrowful one!' Alice, gazing curiously at the Mouse's lengthy tail, commented, 'It is certainly a long tail,' but questioned, 'why do you describe it as sad?' She continued pondering this as the Mouse spoke, her mind interpreting his story as a rhyming tale about a dog named Fury who encounters a mouse, insists they go to court, promises to be judge and jury, and intends to condemn the mouse to death. The Mouse abruptly interrupted, sternly asking Alice, 'You aren't listening! What are you preoccupied with?' 'I sincerely apologize,' Alice replied humbly, 'I thought you had reached the fifth curve, perhaps?' 'Absolutely not!' the Mouse shrieked, sharply and irritably. 'A knot!' exclaimed Alice, always ready to be helpful and looking around anxiously. 'Oh, please let me assist in untangling it!' 'I will do nothing of the kind,' said the Mouse, standing up and moving away. 'You insult me with such silliness!' 'I didn't mean to!' pleaded poor Alice. 'But you become offended so easily, you know!' The Mouse merely grumbled in reply. 'Please come back and finish your narrative!'

The mouse pointed out that a trial without judge or jury would be pointless. Fury insisted he’d be both judge and jury and announce the verdict himself: death.”\n\nThe Mouse sharply accused Alice of not paying attention. Alice apologized humbly, thinking he’d been describing the fifth curve in his tail. The Mouse, now angry, was offended by her misunderstanding.\n\nAlice, eager to help, offered to untie a knot, but the Mouse refused and left in a huff, feeling insulted. Even though Alice insisted she hadn’t meant to offend, the Mouse only growled.

She told herself that something interesting inevitably occurred whenever she ate or drank anything, so she would just see what this bottle did, sincerely hoping it would make her grow larger again, as she was genuinely weary of being such a small creature.",

Still, she decided it was best to find his fan and gloves for him—if only she could locate them. While thinking this, she came across a tidy little house with a shiny brass nameplate on the door reading \"W. RABBIT.\" Without knocking, she entered and hurried upstairs, worried she might run into the actual Mary Ann and be forced to leave before she could retrieve the items.\n\n\"How strange it is,\" Alice mused, \"to be running errands for a rabbit! Maybe Dinah will be sending me on errands next!\" She began to imagine how that might go: \"'Miss Alice! Come here at once and get ready for your walk!' 'Just a minute, nurse! But I have to make sure the mouse doesn't escape.'\" Alice added, \"Though really, I doubt they'd let Dinah stay in the house if she started giving orders like that!\"\n\nSoon, Alice found herself in a small, neat room with a table in front of the window, and there, just as she'd hoped, she saw a fan and two or three pairs of small white kid gloves. She grabbed the fan and a pair of gloves and was about to leave when she noticed a small bottle near the mirror. Unlike before, this one didn't have a label saying \"DRINK ME,\" but she opened it and took a sip anyway. \"Whenever I eat or drink anything here, something interesting always happens,\" she thought, \"so I'll see what happens with this bottle. Hopefully, it will make me grow big again, as I'm rather tired of being so tiny!\""

With more glass breaking, the Rabbit asked Pat what was at the window. Pat replied it was an arm—pronounced \"arrum\"—amazing the Rabbit because the arm filled the whole window. Pat insisted it was an arm regardless, and the Rabbit ordered him to remove it, saying it didn't belong there."

What happened to you? Tell us all about it!”\nLast came a little feeble, squeaking voice, (“That’s Bill,” thought Alice,) “Well, I hardly know—No more, thank ye; I’m better now—but I’m a deal too flustered to tell you—all I know is, something comes at me like a Jack-in-the-box, and up I goes like a sky-rocket!”\n“So you did, old fellow!” said the others.\n“We must burn the house down!” said the Rabbit’s voice; and Alice called out as loud as she could, “If you do, I’ll set Dinah at you!”\nThere was a dead silence instantly, and Alice thought to herself, “I wonder what they will do next! If they had any sense, they’d take the roof off.” After a minute or two, they began moving about again, and Alice heard the Rabbit say, “A barrowful will do, to begin with.”\n“A barrowful of what?” thought Alice; but she had not long to doubt, for the next moment a shower of little pebbles came rattling in at the window, and some of them hit her in the face. “I’ll put a stop to this,” she said to herself, and shouted out, “You’d better not do that again!” which produced another dead silence.\nAlice noticed with some surprise that the pebbles were all turning into little cakes as they lay on the floor, and a bright idea came into her head. “If I eat one of these cakes,” she thought, “it’s sure to make some change in my size; and as it can’t possibly make me larger, it must make me smaller, I suppose.”",

At that point, thinking, 'This must be Bill,' she delivered a swift, hard kick and waited to see what would happen next. The immediate response she heard was a collective outcry of 'There goes Bill!' followed by the distinctive voice of the Rabbit shouting, 'Catch him, you near the hedge!' This was succeeded by a period of silence, and then a jumble of other voices saying, 'Prop up his head—Get some brandy—Don't let him suffocate—How are you doing, old friend? What exactly occurred? Please tell us everything!' Finally, a faint, high-pitched voice spoke. ('That's Bill,' Alice concluded inwardly.) The voice said, 'Well, I'm really not sure—No more, thank you; I feel better now—but I'm far too shaken up to explain—all I recall is, something sprang out at me like a toy from a box, and I shot upwards like a firework!' 'Yes, you certainly did, old fellow!' the others confirmed. 'We'll have to burn the house down!' announced the Rabbit's voice. Alice then yelled back as loudly as she could, 'If you attempt that, I'll unleash Dinah on you!' An immediate and complete silence fell. Alice mused to herself, 'I wonder what their next plan will be! If they possessed any common sense, they'd remove the roof.' After a minute or two, they resumed their activity, and Alice overheard the Rabbit remark, 'A wheelbarrow full will be enough to start with.' 'A wheelbarrow full of *what*?' Alice wondered, but she didn't have to wait long for the answer. The very next second, a barrage of small stones came rattling through the window, some hitting her face. 'I must put a stop to this,' she told herself, and yelled out, 'You had better not try that again!' This resulted in another period of absolute silence. Alice observed with some astonishment that the pebbles were all changing into tiny cakes as they lay on the floor, and a brilliant notion occurred to her. 'If I consume one of these cakes,' she thought, 'it is bound to produce *some* alteration in my size; and since it's impossible for it to make me bigger, I assume it must make me smaller.'",

Tell us!” Then she heard a weak, squeaky voice (which Alice took to be Bill) say, “I don’t quite know—No more brandy, thanks; I’m alright now—but I’m too shaken to explain—it felt like something jumped out at me like a Jack-in-the-box, and I shot up like a rocket!” “You really did!” the others agreed. “We’ll have to burn the house down!” announced the Rabbit, to which Alice shouted loudly, “If you do, I’ll send Dinah after you!” Instantly, there was silence. Alice thought, “I wonder what they’ll try next. If they had any sense, they'd remove the roof.” After a few minutes, she heard movement and the Rabbit saying, “A barrowful will do to start.” “A barrowful of what?” Alice wondered, but before she could puzzle it out, small pebbles began flying in through the window, a few striking her face. “I’ll put a stop to this,” she said, and called out, “You’d better not do that again!” The voices fell silent once more. Alice was surprised to notice the pebbles turning into little cakes as they landed on the floor. Suddenly inspired, she thought, “If I eat one of these cakes, it’s bound to change my size; and since I can’t get any bigger, it must make me smaller.”"

Acting instinctively, she picked up a small twig and offered it to the puppy. With a happy yelp, the puppy leaped into the air with all four feet simultaneously, charged towards the stick, and pretended to chew on it vigorously.

Without really thinking, she picked up a small stick and held it toward the puppy. The puppy instantly leaped into the air with excitement and rushed at the stick, pretending to attack it. Alice quickly moved behind a large thistle so she wouldn't be knocked over, and as soon as she showed herself on the other side, the puppy charged after the stick again, tumbling clumsily in its haste.

Want to buy some?\n\nYou are old, said the youth, and your jaws are too weak for anything tougher than suet; Yet you finished off the goose—bones, beak, and all. How did you manage it?\n\nIn my youth, said his father, I became a lawyer and argued with my wife. The jaw strength I developed has lasted me all my life.\n\nYou are old, said the youth, one would hardly believe your eye is as steady as ever; Yet you balanced an eel on the end of your nose—how did you get so clever?\n\nI have answered three questions, and that's enough, his father said. Don’t be so full of yourself! Do you think I can listen to this nonsense all day? Off you go, or I’ll kick you downstairs!\n\n\"That’s not right,\" said the Caterpillar.\n\"Not exactly right, I’m afraid,\" Alice admitted shyly. \"Some of the words are different.\"\n\"It’s wrong from start to finish,\" declared the Caterpillar, and then they were both silent for a while."

She had just succeeded in curving it down into a graceful zigzag, and was going to dive in among the leaves, which she found to be nothing but the tops of the trees under which she had been wandering, when a sharp hiss made her draw back in a hurry: a large pigeon had flown into her face, and was beating her violently with its wings.\n“Serpent!” screamed the Pigeon.\n“I’m not a serpent!” said Alice indignantly. “Let me alone!”\n“Serpent, I say again!” repeated the Pigeon, but in a more subdued tone, and added with a kind of sob, “I’ve tried every way, and nothing seems to suit them!”\n“I haven’t the least idea what you’re talking about,” said Alice.\n“I’ve tried the roots of trees, and I’ve tried banks, and I’ve tried hedges,” the Pigeon went on, without attending to her; “but those serpents! There’s no pleasing them!”\nAlice was more and more puzzled, but she thought there was no use in saying anything more till the Pigeon had finished.\n“As if it wasn’t trouble enough hatching the eggs,” said the Pigeon; “but I must be on the look-out for serpents night and day! Why, I haven’t had a wink of sleep these three weeks!”\n“I’m very sorry you’ve been annoyed,” said Alice, who was beginning to see its meaning.\n“And just as I’d taken the highest tree in the wood,” continued the Pigeon, raising its voice to a shriek, “and just as I was thinking I should be free of them at last, they must needs come wriggling down from the sky! Ugh, Serpent!”\n“But I’m not a serpent, I tell you!” said Alice. “I’m a—I’m a—”\n“Well! What are you?” said the Pigeon. “I can see you’re trying to invent something!”\n“I—I’m a little girl,” said Alice, rather doubtfully, as she remembered the number of changes she had gone through that day.\n“A likely story indeed!” said the Pigeon in a tone of the deepest contempt. “I’ve seen a good many little girls in my time, but never one with such a neck as that! No, no! You’re a serpent; and there’s no use denying it. I suppose you’ll be telling me next that you never tasted an egg!”\n“I have tasted eggs, certainly,” said Alice, who was a very truthful child; “but little girls eat eggs quite as much as serpents do, you know.”\n“I don’t believe it,” said the Pigeon; “but if they do, why then they’re a kind of serpent, that’s all I can say.”\nThis was such a new idea to Alice, that she was quite silent for a minute or two, which gave the Pigeon the opportunity of adding, “You’re looking for eggs, I know that well enough; and what does it matter to me whether you’re a little girl or a serpent?”\n“It matters a good deal to me,” said Alice hastily; “but I’m not looking for eggs, as it happens; and if I was, I shouldn’t want yours: I don’t like them raw.”\n“Well, be off, then!” said the Pigeon in a sulky tone, as it settled down again into its nest.",

Looking down, she saw only an incredibly long neck extending from her, appearing like a stem rising out of a vast area of green leaves far below. Wondering aloud what the green area could be, where her shoulders had vanished, and why she couldn't see her hands, she waved her hands around as she spoke, but the only effect was a slight rustling in the distant leaves. Since she couldn't lift her hands to her head, she decided to try bending her head down to reach them. To her surprise and delight, her neck was extremely flexible, able to bend in any direction like a snake. She skillfully curved it into a graceful S-shape, intending to look closer at the leaves, which she now saw were actually the tops of the trees she had recently walked under. However, a sudden sharp hissing sound made her pull back quickly. A large pigeon had flown right into her face and was beating her forcefully with its wings. The Pigeon shrieked, \"Serpent!\" Alice replied angrily, \"I am not a serpent! Leave me alone!\" The Pigeon repeated \"Serpent!\" in a slightly calmer, almost tearful tone, adding, \"I've tried everything, and nothing seems to work for them!\" Alice, confused, said she didn't understand what the Pigeon was talking about. Ignoring her, the Pigeon continued, listing places it had searched – tree roots, banks, hedges – complaining about the \"serpents\" that were impossible to satisfy. Alice grew more bewildered but decided to wait until the Pigeon finished speaking. The Pigeon lamented the difficulty of hatching eggs, saying, \"As if that wasn't enough trouble, I have to constantly be on the lookout for serpents, day and night! I haven't slept in three weeks!\" Alice, starting to grasp the Pigeon's distress, said she was sorry it had been troubled. Raising its voice to a scream, the Pigeon went on, \"And just when I chose the tallest tree in the forest, thinking I'd finally be rid of them, they have to come wiggling down from the sky! Ugh, Serpent!\" \"But I tell you, I'm not a serpent!\" Alice insisted, trying to explain, \"I'm a—I'm a—\" Interrupting her, the Pigeon demanded, \"Well? What are you? I can see you're making something up!\" Alice, remembering the many changes she'd experienced that day, hesitated before replying uncertainly, \"I—I'm a little girl.\" The Pigeon responded with deep contempt, calling it an unlikely story. It claimed to have seen many little girls but never one with such a neck, declaring Alice was clearly a serpent and denying it was pointless. The Pigeon then suggested Alice would next deny ever tasting an egg. Alice, being truthful, admitted she had tasted eggs but added that little girls eat eggs just as much as serpents do. The Pigeon dismissed this, saying, \"I don't believe it; but if they do, then they're a type of serpent, that's all I can say.\" This perspective was so new to Alice that she was silent for a minute or two, giving the Pigeon a chance to add, \"I know you're looking for eggs; I know that very well. And what difference does it make to me if you're a little girl or a serpent?\" Alice quickly retorted, \"It matters a great deal to me! But I'm not looking for eggs, actually; and even if I were, I wouldn't want yours – I don't like them raw.\" The Pigeon grumbled, \"Well, go away then!\" as it settled back into its nest.",
          "paraphrase_gpt-4.1-2025-04-14": "\"Finally, my head is free!\" Alice exclaimed cheerfully, but her happiness quickly turned to worry when she realized her shoulders had vanished—instead, when she looked down, all she could see was a very long neck stretching out of a bed of green leaves far below. \n\"What could all those green things be?\" Alice wondered aloud. \"Where have my shoulders gone? And oh, my poor hands, why can't I see you?\" She waved her hands as she spoke, but the only effect was a gentle rustle in the distant leaves.\nSince she couldn't bring her hands to her head, she tried to lower her head toward them, and was pleased to find her neck could bend whichever way she wished, like a snake. Just as she had curled it into a wavy shape and prepared to reach into the leaves—which she now saw were actually the tops of trees—a sudden hiss made her jerk back. A big pigeon swooped at her face, beating her with its wings.\n\"Serpent!\" cried the pigeon.\n\"I'm not a serpent!\" Alice protested angrily. \"Leave me alone!\"\n\"Serpent, I repeat!\" said the pigeon, this time sounding a little desperate, and added with a sob, \"I've tried everything and nothing works with them!\"\n\"I have no idea what you mean,\" Alice replied.\n\"I've tried tree roots, riverbanks, hedges—all of it,\" the pigeon continued, ignoring her. \"But those serpents are never satisfied!\"\nAlice was more confused than ever, but thought it best to let the pigeon finish.\n\"As if hatching eggs wasn't enough work,\" the pigeon complained, \"I have to watch for serpents day and night! I haven't slept in three weeks!\"\n\"I'm sorry you've had such trouble,\" said Alice, starting to understand.\n\"And just as I reached the tallest tree,\" shrieked the pigeon, \"and thought I'd be safe, they come slithering down from the sky! Ugh, serpent!\"\n\"But I'm not a serpent!\" insisted Alice. \"I'm a—I'm a—\"\n\"Well, what are you?\" the pigeon demanded. \"I can tell you're making something up!\"\n\"I'm a little girl,\" Alice said, uncertainly, remembering all the strange changes she'd gone through that day.\n\"I doubt that!\" scoffed the pigeon. \"I've seen plenty of little girls, but none with a neck like that! You're a serpent—and there's no use denying it. I suppose you'll now say you've never eaten an egg!\"\n\"I have eaten eggs, yes,\" Alice admitted honestly, \"but little girls eat eggs just like serpents do.\"\n\"I don't believe that,\" the pigeon said. \"But if it's true, then little girls are just a kind of serpent, as far as I'm concerned.\"\nThis idea was so new to Alice that she stayed quiet for a minute, giving the pigeon a chance to continue, \"You're looking for eggs, I know it; and why should I care if you're a girl or a serpent?\"\n\"It makes a big difference to me,\" Alice said quickly, \"but I'm not searching for eggs, and even if I were, I wouldn't want yours—I don't like them raw.\"\n\"Then go away!\" muttered the pigeon grumpily as it settled back into its nest."

The Footman replied that the real question was whether she should get in at all, a comment Alice disliked. She found the constant arguing of Wonderland's creatures maddening. The Footman used the pause to repeat that he'd be sitting there for days. Desperate, Alice asked what she should do, but he only told her she could do as she liked and started whistling.

Pig!”\nShe said the last word with such sudden violence that Alice quite jumped; but she saw in another moment that it was addressed to the baby, and not to her, so she took courage, and went on again:—\n“I didn’t know that Cheshire cats always grinned; in fact, I didn’t know that cats could grin.”\n“They all can,” said the Duchess; “and most of ’em do.”\n“I don’t know of any that do,” Alice said very politely, feeling quite pleased to have got into a conversation.\n“You don’t know much,” said the Duchess; “and that’s a fact.”\nAlice did not at all like the tone of this remark, and thought it would be as well to introduce some other subject of conversation. While she was trying to fix on one, the cook took the cauldron of soup off the fire, and at once set to work throwing everything within her reach at the Duchess and the baby—the fire-irons came first; then followed a shower of saucepans, plates, and dishes. The Duchess took no notice of them even when they hit her; and the baby was howling so much already, that it was quite impossible to say whether the blows hurt it or not.\n“Oh, please mind what you’re doing!” cried Alice, jumping up and down in an agony of terror. “Oh, there goes his precious nose!” as an unusually large saucepan flew close by it, and very nearly carried it off.\n“If everybody minded their own business,” the Duchess said in a hoarse growl, “the world would go round a deal faster than it does.”\n“Which would not be an advantage,” said Alice, who felt very glad to get an opportunity of showing off a little of her knowledge. “Just think of what work it would make with the day and night! You see the earth takes twenty-four hours to turn round on its axis—”\n“Talking of axes,” said the Duchess, “chop off her head!”",

Pig!\" Her sudden, fierce shout of the last word startled Alice, making her jump. However, when she realized the Duchess was speaking to the baby and not her, she regained her composure and continued, \"I wasn't aware that Cheshire cats constantly grinned; actually, I didn't even know cats were capable of grinning.\"\n\"They certainly are,\" the Duchess stated, \"and most of them do.\"\nAlice, feeling quite pleased to be included in the conversation, responded very politely, \"I don't know any cats that do.\"\n\"You lack much knowledge,\" the Duchess said bluntly, \"that much is certain.\"\nAlice disliked the tone of this comment and decided it would be best to change the subject. While she pondered what to talk about, the cook removed the soup pot from the fire and immediately began flinging everything nearby at the Duchess and the baby. First came the fire-poker and tongs, followed by an onslaught of pots, plates, and bowls. The Duchess paid them no mind, even when struck, and the baby was already crying so loudly that it was impossible to tell if it felt the impact of the objects.\n\"Oh, please be careful!\" Alice screamed, leaping up and down in utter panic. \"Oh, there goes his precious nose!\" she added as a particularly large pot narrowly missed the baby's face, almost hitting it.\n\"If everyone minded their own affairs,\" the Duchess growled hoarsely, \"the world would spin around much faster than it does.\"\n\"That wouldn't actually be beneficial,\" Alice countered, pleased to have a chance to display some of her knowledge. \"Just consider the impact on the cycle of day and night! You see, the Earth requires twenty-four hours to rotate on its axis—\"\n\"Speaking of axes,\" the Duchess interrupted, \"cut off her head!\"",

Gaining a bit more confidence, Alice continued: \"I didn’t know Cheshire cats grinned all the time; honestly, I didn’t even know cats could grin.\" \n\"They all can,\" the Duchess answered, \"and most of them do.\" \n\"I’ve never met one that does,\" Alice said politely, happy to have started a conversation. \n\"You don’t know much, then,\" replied the Duchess. Alice disliked the tone of that comment and decided she should change the topic. As she considered a new subject, the cook pulled a pot of soup off the fire and immediately began throwing anything she could grab at the Duchess and the baby: first the fire-irons, then a barrage of saucepans, plates, and dishes.

For the first couple of minutes, just holding it was the most she could manage.

Alice thought to herself, 'If I don't take this child with me, they are sure to kill it soon; wouldn't leaving it behind be an act of murder?' She spoke these last words aloud, and the baby responded with a grunt (it had stopped sneezing by this point). \"Don't grunt,\" Alice said, telling it that wasn't a suitable way to express itself. The baby grunted again, causing Alice to look closely and anxiously at its face, trying to understand what was wrong. It was undeniable that its nose was very turned-up, more like a snout than a proper nose, and its eyes were getting extremely small for a baby. Overall, Alice found its appearance very unappealing. However, she wondered if it was only sobbing and checked its eyes again for tears. There were no tears.

It looked good-natured, she thought: still it had very long claws and a great many teeth, so she felt that it ought to be treated with respect.\n“Cheshire Puss,” she began, rather timidly, as she did not at all know whether it would like the name: however, it only grinned a little wider. “Come, it’s pleased so far,” thought Alice, and she went on. “Would you tell me, please, which way I ought to go from here?”\n“That depends a good deal on where you want to get to,” said the Cat.\n“I don’t much care where—” said Alice.\n“Then it doesn’t matter which way you go,” said the Cat.\n“—so long as I get somewhere,” Alice added as an explanation.\n“Oh, you’re sure to do that,” said the Cat, “if you only walk long enough.”\nAlice felt that this could not be denied, so she tried another question. “What sort of people live about here?”\n“In that direction,” the Cat said, waving its right paw round, “lives a Hatter: and in that direction,” waving the other paw, “lives a March Hare.

She mused to herself that if it had grown into a human, it would have been an incredibly unattractive child, but as a pig, she thought it was quite appealing. This led her to consider other children she knew who she felt might also be well-suited to being pigs. She was just contemplating aloud, 'if only one knew the proper method for transforming them...' when she was slightly taken aback to see the Cheshire Cat perched on a tree branch a few yards away. The Cat merely smiled upon seeing Alice. Alice found its appearance pleasant, but noting its exceptionally long claws and numerous teeth, she concluded it was best to treat it with respect. Hesitantly, unsure if the name would be welcome, she began, 'Cheshire Puss.' The Cat only broadened its grin slightly. 'Alright, it seems pleased so far,' Alice thought, and continued, 'Could you possibly tell me which direction I should go from here?' The Cat responded that the path she should take depended significantly on where she wished to end up. Alice replied that she didn't particularly care about the destination. 'Then it makes no difference which way you go,' the Cat stated. Alice clarified, '—as long as I arrive somewhere.' 'Oh, that's certain to happen,' said the Cat, 'provided you simply walk far enough.' Alice couldn't argue with this logic, so she posed a different question. 'What kind of individuals live in this area?' The Cat, waving its right paw, said, 'In that direction, a Hatter resides; and in that direction,' waving its other paw, 'lives a March Hare. Feel free to visit either; they are both insane.' Alice commented that she didn't want to associate with people who were mad. 'Ah, you can't avoid that,' the Cat replied. 'We are all mad here. I am mad. You are mad.' 'How can you be sure I'm mad?' Alice asked. 'You must be,' the Cat declared, 'otherwise, you wouldn't have come to this place.'",

Although it seemed friendly, it had very long claws and lots of sharp teeth, so Alice felt she should be cautious.\n\n“Noble Cheshire Cat,” Alice began hesitantly, not sure if the Cat would like being called that. But the Cat only grinned wider. “Well, it seems to like it so far,” Alice thought, and continued, “Would you please tell me which way I should go from here?”\n\n“That depends a great deal on where you wish to end up,” replied the Cat.\n\n“I’m really not particular,” said Alice.\n\n“Then it doesn’t matter which way you go,” responded the Cat.\n\n“—as long as I arrive somewhere,” Alice explained.\n\n“Oh, you’ll definitely get somewhere,” the Cat assured her, “if you walk long enough.”\n\nAlice realized she couldn’t argue with that, so she tried asking something else. “What kind of people live near here?”\n\nPointing with its right paw, the Cat said, “In that direction lives a Hatter; and in the other direction,” pointing with its left, “lives a March Hare. You can visit either: they’re both crazy.”\n\n“But I don’t want to be around mad people,” Alice said.\n\n“Oh, you can’t avoid that,” said the Cat, “everyone here is mad. I’m mad. You’re mad.”\n\n“How do you know I’m mad?” Alice asked.\n\n“You must be,” the Cat replied, “or you wouldn’t have come here.”"

Now I growl when I’m pleased, and wag my tail when I’m angry. Therefore I’m mad.”\n“I call it purring, not growling,” said Alice.\n“Call it what you like,” said the Cat. “Do you play croquet with the Queen to-day?”\n“I should like it very much,” said Alice, “but I haven’t been invited yet.”\n“You’ll see me there,” said the Cat, and vanished.\nAlice was not much surprised at this, she was getting so used to queer things happening. While she was looking at the place where it had been, it suddenly appeared again.\n“By-the-bye, what became of the baby?” said the Cat. “I’d nearly forgotten to ask.”\n“It turned into a pig,” Alice quietly said, just as if it had come back in a natural way.\n“I thought it would,” said the Cat, and vanished again.\nAlice waited a little, half expecting to see it again, but it did not appear, and after a minute or two she walked on in the direction in which the March Hare was said to live. “I’ve seen hatters before,” she said to herself; “the March Hare will be much the most interesting, and perhaps as this is May it won’t be raving mad—at least not so mad as it was in March.” As she said this, she looked up, and there was the Cat again, sitting on a branch of a tree.\n“Did you say pig, or fig?” said the Cat.\n“I said pig,” replied Alice; “and I wish you wouldn’t keep appearing and vanishing so suddenly: you make one quite giddy.”\n“All right,” said the Cat; and this time it vanished quite slowly, beginning with the end of the tail, and ending with the grin, which remained some time after the rest of it had gone.\n“Well! I’ve often seen a cat without a grin,” thought Alice; “but a grin without a cat! It’s the most curious thing I ever saw in my life!”\nShe had not gone much farther before she came in sight of the house of the March Hare: she thought it must be the right house, because the chimneys were shaped like ears and the roof was thatched with fur. It was so large a house, that she did not like to go nearer till she had nibbled some more of the lefthand bit of mushroom, and raised herself to about two feet high: even then she walked up towards it rather timidly, saying to herself “Suppose it should be raving mad after all!

You agree with that, don't you?\" Alice conceded, \"I suppose so.\" \"Very well,\" the Cat continued, \"you see, a dog snarls when it's upset and wags its tail when it's pleased. Now, I snarl when I'm pleased, and I wag my tail when I'm upset. Therefore, I am insane.\" Alice countered, \"I'd call that purring, not snarling.\" The Cat dismissed this, saying, \"Call it whatever you wish. Are you playing croquet with the Queen today?\" Alice responded, \"I'd love to, but I haven't received an invitation yet.\" \"You'll find me there,\" the Cat stated before disappearing. Alice wasn't particularly surprised, as she was becoming accustomed to strange occurrences. As she stared at the spot where the Cat had been, it suddenly materialized again. \"Incidentally, what became of the infant?\" the Cat inquired. \"I nearly forgot to ask.\" Alice calmly replied, \"It transformed into a swine,\" speaking as if such a thing were entirely normal. \"I suspected it might,\" said the Cat, and vanished once more. Alice lingered for a while, half expecting to see it reappear, but it didn't. After a minute or two, she proceeded in the direction where the March Hare was said to reside. She mused to herself, \"I've encountered hat makers before; the March Hare will likely be far more fascinating, and perhaps since it's May, he won't be raving lunatic—at least, not as lunatic as he was in March.\" As she thought this, she glanced up and saw the Cat perched on a tree branch, back again. \"Did you utter 'pig' or 'fig'?\" the Cat asked. \"I said 'pig',\" Alice reiterated, \"and I wish you would stop appearing and disappearing so abruptly; it makes one quite dizzy.\" \"Understood,\" the Cat replied, and this time it faded away quite gradually, starting with the tip of its tail and finishing with its grin, which lingered for some time after the rest of its body was gone. \"Remarkable! I've frequently seen a feline without a smirk,\" Alice thought, \"but a smirk without a feline! It's the oddest thing I've ever witnessed in my entire life!\" She hadn't gone much further before she spotted the March Hare's dwelling. She was certain it was the correct place because the chimneys resembled ears and the roof was covered with animal fur. The house was so large that she hesitated to approach until she had taken another bite of the piece of mushroom from her left hand side, raising herself to a height of about two feet.

You agree, right?\"\n\n\"I think so,\" Alice answered.\n\n\"Well,\" the Cat said, \"dogs growl when they're angry and wag their tails when they're happy. I, on the other hand, growl when I’m pleased and wag my tail when I’m angry. So, I must be mad.\"\n\n\"I would call it purring, not growling,\" Alice remarked.\n\n\"Call it whatever you like,\" replied the Cat. \"Are you playing croquet with the Queen today?\"\n\n\"I’d love to, but I haven’t been invited yet,\" Alice replied.\n\n\"You’ll see me there,\" said the Cat, before disappearing.\n\nAlice wasn’t too surprised, as she was becoming accustomed to strange things happening.

She recognized it because the chimneys looked like ears and the thatched roof was covered in fur.

Alice thought, \"How uncomfortable for the Dormouse,\" adding, \"but since it's asleep, I suppose it won't mind.\" Although the table was large, the three of them were huddled together closely at one corner. Spotting Alice approaching, they yelled, \"No room! No room!\" Alice retorted indignantly, \"There is plenty of room!\" and took a seat in a large armchair at the far end of the table. The March Hare, in a seemingly friendly tone, suggested, \"Have some wine.\" Alice looked around the table but saw only tea. \"I don't see any wine,\" she observed. The March Hare replied, \"There isn't any.\" Annoyed, Alice stated, \"Then it was very impolite of you to offer it.\" The March Hare countered, \"It was very impolite of you to sit down without an invitation.\" Alice replied, \"I didn't realize it was your table; it's set for many more than three.\" The Hatter, who had been studying Alice with intense curiosity, spoke for the first time, remarking, \"Your hair needs cutting.\" Alice responded with considerable sternness, \"You ought to learn not to make personal comments; it's very rude.\" Hearing this, the Hatter's eyes widened significantly, but his only response was, \"Why is a raven like a writing-desk?\" Alice, thinking, \"Ah, this will be entertaining! I'm glad they're starting with riddles. I believe I can solve that,\" she said aloud. The March Hare asked, \"Do you mean you think you can discover the answer?\" \"Precisely,\" Alice affirmed. \"Then you should state exactly what you mean,\" the March Hare continued. \"I do,\" Alice quickly replied, \"at least—at least I mean what I say—that's the same thing, you know.\" \"Absolutely not the same thing!\" declared the Hatter. \"You could just as easily claim that 'I see what I eat' is identical to 'I eat what I see'!\" \"You could just as easily claim,\" the March Hare added, \"that 'I like what I get' is identical to 'I get what I like'!\" \"You could just as easily claim,\" mumbled the Dormouse, seemingly talking in his sleep, \"that 'I breathe when I sleep' is identical to 'I sleep when I breathe'!\" \"With you, it is the same thing,\" the Hatter said, and the discussion ceased.

When Alice approached, they shouted, ‘No room! No room!’ but Alice insisted, ‘There’s plenty of room!’ and took a seat in a big armchair at the table’s end. The March Hare then politely offered her some wine. Looking around and finding only tea on the table, Alice replied that she didn’t see any wine. The March Hare admitted there wasn’t any, making Alice comment it was impolite to offer something they didn’t have. The March Hare retorted that it was impolite for Alice to sit down without being asked. Alice pointed out that, given the table was set for many, she didn’t know it belonged to them exclusively. The Hatter, who had been scrutinizing Alice for a while, said her hair needed cutting. Alice sternly told him it was rude to make personal remarks. The Hatter’s eyes widened, but he simply asked, 'Why is a raven like a writing desk?' Alice was excited at the prospect of a riddle and declared she thought she could solve it. The March Hare asked if she truly thought she could figure out the answer. When Alice confirmed, the March Hare said she should say exactly what she means. Alice replied she always does—at least, she means what she says, insisting that’s the same thing. The Hatter disagreed, arguing it’s no more the same than saying ‘I see what I eat’ is the same as ‘I eat what I see.’ The March Hare added his own comparison, as did the Dormouse in his sleep. The Hatter said that with the Dormouse, it might actually be the same, and then everyone fell silent for a while as Alice tried to recall anything she knew about ravens and writing desks, which wasn’t much."

The Hatter’s remark seemed to have no sort of meaning in it, and yet it was certainly English. “I don’t quite understand you,” she said, as politely as she could.\n“The Dormouse is asleep again,” said the Hatter, and he poured a little hot tea upon its nose.\nThe Dormouse shook its head impatiently, and said, without opening its eyes, “Of course, of course; just what I was going to remark myself.”\n“Have you guessed the riddle yet?” the Hatter said, turning to Alice again.\n“No, I give it up,” Alice replied: “what’s the answer?”\n“I haven’t the slightest idea,” said the Hatter.\n“Nor I,” said the March Hare.\nAlice sighed wearily. “I think you might do something better with the time,” she said, “than waste it in asking riddles that have no answers.”\n“If you knew Time as well as I do,” said the Hatter, “you wouldn’t talk about wasting it. It’s him.”\n“I don’t know what you mean,” said Alice.\n“Of course you don’t!” the Hatter said, tossing his head contemptuously. “I dare say you never even spoke to Time!”\n“Perhaps not,” Alice cautiously replied: “but I know I have to beat time when I learn music.”\n“Ah! that accounts for it,” said the Hatter. “He won’t stand beating. Now, if you only kept on good terms with him, he’d do almost anything you liked with the clock. For instance, suppose it were nine o’clock in the morning, just time to begin lessons: you’d only have to whisper a hint to Time, and round goes the clock in a twinkling! Half-past one, time for dinner!”\n(“I only wish it was,” the March Hare said to itself in a whisper.)\n“That would be grand, certainly,” said Alice thoughtfully: “but then—I shouldn’t be hungry for it, you know.”\n“Not at first, perhaps,” said the Hatter: “but you could keep it to half-past one as long as you liked.”\n“Is that the way you manage?” Alice asked.\nThe Hatter shook his head mournfully. “Not I!” he replied. “We quarrelled last March—just before he went mad, you know—” (pointing with his tea spoon at the March Hare,) “—it was at the great concert given by the Queen of Hearts, and I had to sing\n‘Twinkle, twinkle, little bat!\nHow I wonder what you’re at!’\nYou know the song, perhaps?”\n“I’ve heard something like it,” said Alice.\n“It goes on, you know,” the Hatter continued, “in this way:—\n‘Up above the world you fly,\nLike a tea-tray in the sky.\n                    Twinkle, twinkle—’”\nHere the Dormouse shook itself, and began singing in its sleep “Twinkle, twinkle, twinkle, twinkle—” and went on so long that they had to pinch it to make it stop.\n“Well, I’d hardly finished the first verse,” said the Hatter, “when the Queen jumped up and bawled out, ‘He’s murdering the time! Off with his head!’”\n“How dreadfully savage!” exclaimed Alice.\n“And ever since that,” the Hatter went on in a mournful tone, “he won’t do a thing I ask! It’s always six o’clock now.”\nA bright idea came into Alice’s head. “Is that the reason so many tea-things are put out here?” she asked.\n“Yes, that’s it,” said the Hatter with a sigh: “it’s always tea-time, and we’ve no time to wash the things between whiles.”\n“Then you keep moving round, I suppose?” said Alice.\n“Exactly so,” said the Hatter: “as the things get used up.”",

She responded, as politely as possible, \"I don't quite follow you.\" The Hatter noted the Dormouse was asleep again and poured a little hot tea onto its nose. The Dormouse impatiently shook its head and, without opening its eyes, mumbled, \"Obviously, obviously; precisely what I was about to say myself.\" Turning back to Alice, the Hatter asked, \"Have you figured out the riddle yet?\" \"No, I give up,\" Alice replied. \"What's the answer?\" \"I haven't the faintest notion,\" the Hatter stated. \"Me neither,\" added the March Hare. Alice let out a tired sigh. \"I believe you could use your time more productively,\" she commented, \"instead of wasting it on riddles that have no solutions.\" \"If your understanding of Time was as good as mine,\" the Hatter retorted, \"you wouldn't speak of wasting it. Time is a person.\" \"I don't understand what you mean,\" said Alice. \"Of course, you don't!\" the Hatter exclaimed, tossing his head dismissively. \"I bet you've never even had a conversation with Time!\" \"Perhaps not,\" Alice responded cautiously, \"but I know I have to keep time when I practice music.\" \"Ah! That clarifies it,\" said the Hatter. \"He can't stand being beaten. Now, if you just stayed on good terms with him, he'd adjust the clock almost any way you wanted. For instance, imagine it was nine in the morning, lesson time: you'd only need to whisper a hint to Time, and instantly, the clock would jump! Half-past one, time for dinner!\" (The March Hare whispered to himself, \"I only wish it were.\") \"That would indeed be wonderful,\" Alice said thoughtfully, \"but then--I wouldn't be hungry for it, you know.\" \"Not right away, maybe,\" the Hatter conceded, \"but you could leave it at half-past one for as long as you wished.\" \"Is that how you manage things?\" Alice inquired. The Hatter shook his head sadly. \"Not us!\" he replied. \"We fell out last March--just before he lost his mind, you see--\" (gesturing at the March Hare with his tea spoon) \"--it was during the big concert hosted by the Queen of Hearts, and I was supposed to sing 'Twinkle, twinkle, little bat! How I wonder what you're at!' You might know the tune?\" \"I've heard something similar,\" Alice acknowledged. \"It continues, you know,\" the Hatter went on, \"like this:-- 'Up above the world you fly, Like a tea-tray in the sky. Twinkle, twinkle--'\" At this point, the Dormouse stirred and began singing \"Twinkle, twinkle, twinkle, twinkle--\" in its sleep, going on for so long that they had to pinch it to make it stop. \"Well, I'd barely finished the first verse,\" the Hatter recounted, \"when the Queen leaped up and screamed, 'He's murdering the time! Off with his head!'\" \"How incredibly cruel!\" Alice exclaimed. \"And ever since then,\" the Hatter continued in a melancholy voice, \"Time refuses to do anything I ask! It's always six o'clock now.\" A sudden thought occurred to Alice. \"Is that why there are so many tea-things laid out here?\" she asked. \"Yes, precisely,\" said the Hatter with a sigh. \"It's perpetually tea-time, and we never have a moment to wash the dishes in between.\" \"Then I assume you just move around the table?\" Alice proposed. \"Exactly,\" the Hatter confirmed, \"as the items get used up.\"",

What’s the answer?”\n“Not a clue,” said the Hatter.\n“Me neither,” added the March Hare.\nAlice sighed in frustration. “Surely there are better ways to spend your time than asking riddles with no answers,” she commented.\n“If you understood Time as I do,” the Hatter replied, “you wouldn’t say you were wasting it. Time is a person—he.”\n“I don’t get what you mean,” said Alice.\nThe Hatter scoffed, “Of course you don’t! I bet you’ve never even spoken to Time!”\n“Maybe not,” Alice answered cautiously, “but I do have to keep time when I practice music.”\n“That explains it,” said the Hatter. “Time doesn’t like to be beaten. If you kept on good terms with him, you could get the clock to do almost anything. For example, if it was nine in the morning, just time for lessons, you could give Time a hint, and boom!

We had a falling out last March—just before he (gesturing at the March Hare) went mad.

It’s six o’clock all the time now.”\nAlice suddenly understood. “Is that why there are so many cups and plates out here?” she asked.\n“That’s exactly right,” sighed the Hatter. “It’s always tea-time, and we never have time to wash up in between.”\n“So you just keep moving around the table?” Alice said.\n“Precisely,” answered the Hatter. “We rotate as we use up the settings.”"

The Dormouse slowly opened his eyes and stated in a weak, rough voice, \"I wasn't asleep. I heard everything you were discussing.\" The March Hare prompted him to tell a story, and Alice eagerly added, \"Yes, please do!\" The Hatter urged him to hurry, warning he'd fall asleep again before finishing. The Dormouse began his tale in a rush, saying, \"Once upon a time, there were three young sisters named Elsie, Lacie, and Tillie, and they resided at the bottom of a well—\" Alice, always interested in food and drink, interrupted to ask what they ate. After a moment or two of thought, the Dormouse replied, \"They subsisted on treacle.\" Alice gently pointed out, \"They couldn't have lived on that; they would have been sick.\" The Dormouse confirmed, \"Indeed, they were; very ill.\" Alice tried to imagine such an unusual way of life but found it too confusing, so she continued, \"But why did they live at the bottom of a well?\" The March Hare, quite earnestly, told Alice to have more tea. Offended, Alice responded, \"I haven't had any yet, so I can't have more.\" The Hatter corrected her, \"You mean you can't have less; it's simple to have more than nothing.\" Alice retorted, \"No one asked for your opinion.\" The Hatter triumphantly questioned, \"Who's making personal comments now?\" Alice was unsure how to reply, so she helped herself to tea and bread-and-butter, then turned back to the Dormouse and repeated her question.

Where did they get the treacle to draw?\" \"You can extract water from a well,\" the Hatter stated, \"so logically, you could get treacle from a treacle-well, wouldn't you think—you idiot?\" \"But they were *inside* the well,\" Alice said to the Dormouse, opting to ignore the Hatter's final comment. \"Naturally, they were,\" the Dormouse confirmed, \"—well inside.\" This response left poor Alice utterly bewildered, causing her to let the Dormouse continue its story for a while without interruption. \"They were having drawing lessons,\" the Dormouse resumed, yawning and rubbing its eyes, clearly getting very drowsy, \"and they drew all sorts of things—anything starting with the letter M—\" \"Why only M?\" Alice asked. \"Why shouldn't they?\" the March Hare retorted. Alice had no reply. By now, the Dormouse's eyes were shut, and it was drifting off to sleep. However, after the Hatter gave it a pinch, it awoke with a small cry and continued: \"—things that start with M, like mouse-traps, the moon, memory, and 'muchness'—you know how people say things are 'much of a muchness'—have you ever encountered a drawing of 'muchness'?\" \"Honestly, now that you mention it,\" a very perplexed Alice began, \"I don't believe—\" \"In that case, you ought to keep quiet,\" the Hatter stated. This final instance of rudeness was unbearable for Alice. She stood up in utter dismay and left. The Dormouse immediately fell asleep, and neither the Hatter nor the March Hare paid any attention to her departure, even though she glanced back once or twice, partly wishing they would call her back. When she last saw them, they were attempting to stuff the Dormouse into the teapot.",
          "paraphrase_gpt-4.1-2025-04-14": "Nevertheless, he agreed to continue. \"So these three young sisters—they were learning to draw, you see—\"\n\"What were they drawing?\" Alice asked, forgetting she had promised not to interrupt.\n\"Treacle,\" replied the Dormouse, without giving it any thought this time.\n\"I need a clean cup,\" the Hatter cut in. \"Let's each move one spot over.\"\nAs he spoke, he shifted places and the Dormouse followed. The March Hare took the Dormouse's seat, and Alice, not very enthusiastically, took the spot just vacated by the March Hare. Only the Hatter benefited from the switch: Alice found herself in a worse position, since the March Hare had just spilled the milk-jug all over his plate.\nNot wanting to annoy the Dormouse again, Alice cautiously said, \"But I don't quite get it. Where did they draw the treacle from?\"\n\"You can get water from a well, can't you? So I suppose you can get treacle from a treacle-well—right, dummy?\" said the Hatter.\n\"But they were inside the well,\" Alice pointed out to the Dormouse, pointedly ignoring the Hatter's insult.\n\"Of course they were,\" said the Dormouse. \"Well in.\"\nThis reply left Alice so puzzled that she didn't interrupt the Dormouse for some time.\n\"They were learning to draw,\" the Dormouse continued, yawning and rubbing his eyes because he was getting sleepy, \"and they drew all sorts of things—everything that starts with an M—\"\n\"Why with an M?\" Alice asked.\n\"Why not?\" said the March Hare.\nAlice didn't say anything.\nBy now the Dormouse had closed his eyes and started to doze off. But the Hatter pinched him, waking him up with a little shriek. The Dormouse said, \"—things starting with M, like mouse-traps, the moon, memory, and muchness—you know how people say things are ‘much of a muchness’—have you ever seen a drawing of muchness?\"\n\"Honestly, now that you mention it,\" Alice said, feeling very confused, \"I don't think—\"\n\"Then you shouldn't speak,\" snapped the Hatter.\nAlice couldn't stand this rudeness any longer: she stood up in disgust and walked away. The Dormouse fell asleep immediately, and neither the Hatter nor the March Hare paid her any attention, even though she glanced back once or twice, half hoping they might call her back. The last thing she saw was the others trying to put the Dormouse into the teapot."

Then, after getting its head back down to try again, she found it frustrating that the hedgehog would have uncurled itself and was crawling away.

She had already heard her sentence three of the players to be executed for having missed their turns, and she did not like the look of things at all, as the game was in such confusion that she never knew whether it was her turn or not. So she went in search of her hedgehog.\nThe hedgehog was engaged in a fight with another hedgehog, which seemed to Alice an excellent opportunity for croqueting one of them with the other: the only difficulty was, that her flamingo was gone across to the other side of the garden, where Alice could see it trying in a helpless sort of way to fly up into a tree.\nBy the time she had caught the flamingo and brought it back, the fight was over, and both the hedgehogs were out of sight: “but it doesn’t matter much,” thought Alice, “as all the arches are gone from this side of the ground.” So she tucked it away under her arm, that it might not escape again, and went back for a little more conversation with her friend.\nWhen she got back to the Cheshire Cat, she was surprised to find quite a large crowd collected round it: there was a dispute going on between the executioner, the King, and the Queen, who were all talking at once, while all the rest were quite silent, and looked very uncomfortable.\nThe moment Alice appeared, she was appealed to by all three to settle the question, and they repeated their arguments to her, though, as they all spoke at once, she found it very hard indeed to make out exactly what they said.\nThe executioner’s argument was, that you couldn’t cut off a head unless there was a body to cut it off from: that he had never had to do such a thing before, and he wasn’t going to begin at his time of life.\nThe King’s argument was, that anything that had a head could be beheaded, and that you weren’t to talk nonsense.\nThe Queen’s argument was, that if something wasn’t done about it in less than no time she’d have everybody executed, all round. (It was this last remark that had made the whole party look so grave and anxious.)\nAlice could think of nothing else to say but “It belongs to the Duchess: you’d better ask her about it.”\n“She’s in prison,” the Queen said to the executioner: “fetch her here.” And the executioner went off like an arrow.\nThe Cat’s head began fading away the moment he was gone, and, by the time he had come back with the Duchess, it had entirely disappeared; so the King and the executioner ran wildly up and down looking for it, while the rest of the party went back to the game.",

She had already witnessed the Queen sentencing three players to execution for missing their turns, and the overall situation made her uneasy, as the game was in such disarray that she was never sure when it was her go. So, she went off to find her hedgehog.\nShe found the hedgehog fighting with another one, which Alice thought was an excellent chance to use one as a ball to hit the other in croquet. The only problem was that her flamingo, which served as a mallet, had moved to the far side of the garden, where Alice could see it awkwardly attempting to fly up into a tree.\nBy the time she managed to catch the flamingo and bring it back, the fight was over, and both hedgehogs were gone. \"But it doesn't make much difference,\" Alice decided, \"since all the arches are missing from this part of the ground.\" She then held the flamingo securely under her arm so it couldn't get away again and went back to chat a little more with her friend.\nWhen she returned to the Cheshire Cat, she was surprised to discover a considerable crowd gathered around it. An argument was taking place between the executioner, the King, and the Queen, who were all speaking simultaneously, while everyone else stood silently, looking very uncomfortable.\nThe moment Alice arrived, all three appealed to her to settle the disagreement, and they repeated their points to her. However, since they were all talking at once, she found it extremely difficult to understand exactly what they were saying.\nThe executioner's argument was that it's impossible to behead someone unless the head is attached to a body. He added that he had never had to do such a thing before and was certainly not going to start doing so now, at his age.\nThe King's argument was that anything with a head could be decapitated and that one shouldn't speak foolishly.\nThe Queen's argument was that if the matter wasn't dealt with instantly, she would have everyone present executed, without exception. (This final comment was what had caused everyone else to look so serious and worried.)\nAlice could only think to suggest, \"It belongs to the Duchess; you'd better ask her about it.\"\n\"She's in prison,\" the Queen told the executioner. \"Go and bring her here.\" And the executioner departed very quickly.\nThe Cat's head started to vanish the moment the executioner left. By the time he returned with the Duchess, it had completely disappeared.

She had already heard that the Queen had ordered three players to be executed for missing their turns, and Alice was disturbed by the chaotic state of the game, as she could never be sure when her turn was. She went to look for her hedgehog, but found it fighting with another hedgehog, which she thought would work well for her to hit one with the other in the game. The problem, however, was that her flamingo had wandered off to the other side of the garden, and Alice could see it awkwardly trying to fly up a tree. By the time Alice retrieved the flamingo, the hedgehogs had finished fighting and had disappeared from sight, but she didn’t mind much since the arches were missing from that side of the croquet ground anyway. She tucked the flamingo under her arm to keep it from escaping again and went back to talk more with her friend. When she returned to the Cheshire Cat, she was surprised to see a large group gathered around it.

The executioner argued he could not cut off a head if there was no body attached, since he had never done so before and did not intend to start now. The King insisted that if something had a head it could be beheaded and told the others not to be ridiculous. The Queen threatened that if something wasn’t done immediately she would order everyone’s execution, which explained why everyone appeared anxious. Alice couldn’t think of anything except to suggest, “It belongs to the Duchess; you should ask her about it.” The Queen told the executioner to fetch the Duchess from prison, and he hurried off. As soon as he left, the Cheshire Cat’s head began to fade, and by the time the executioner returned with the Duchess, the head had completely vanished. The King and executioner ran around looking for it, while the others returned to the game."

Soup does very well without—Maybe it’s always pepper that makes people hot-tempered,” she went on, very much pleased at having found out a new kind of rule, “and vinegar that makes them sour—and camomile that makes them bitter—and—and barley-sugar and such things that make children sweet-tempered. I only wish people knew that: then they wouldn’t be so stingy about it, you know—”\nShe had quite forgotten the Duchess by this time, and was a little startled when she heard her voice close to her ear. “You’re thinking about something, my dear, and that makes you forget to talk. I can’t tell you just now what the moral of that is, but I shall remember it in a bit.”\n“Perhaps it hasn’t one,” Alice ventured to remark.\n“Tut, tut, child!” said the Duchess. “Everything’s got a moral, if only you can find it.” And she squeezed herself up closer to Alice’s side as she spoke.\nAlice did not much like keeping so close to her: first, because the Duchess was very ugly; and secondly, because she was exactly the right height to rest her chin upon Alice’s shoulder, and it was an uncomfortably sharp chin. However, she did not like to be rude, so she bore it as well as she could.\n“The game’s going on rather better now,” she said, by way of keeping up the conversation a little.\n“’Tis so,” said the Duchess: “and the moral of that is—‘Oh, ’tis love, ’tis love, that makes the world go round!’”\n“Somebody said,” Alice whispered, “that it’s done by everybody minding their own business!”\n“Ah, well! It means much the same thing,” said the Duchess, digging her sharp little chin into Alice’s shoulder as she added, “and the moral of that is—‘Take care of the sense, and the sounds will take care of themselves.’”\n“How fond she is of finding morals in things!” Alice thought to herself.\n“I dare say you’re wondering why I don’t put my arm round your waist,” the Duchess said after a pause: “the reason is, that I’m doubtful about the temper of your flamingo. Shall I try the experiment?”\n“He might bite,” Alice cautiously replied, not feeling at all anxious to have the experiment tried.\n“Very true,” said the Duchess: “flamingoes and mustard both bite. And the moral of that is—‘Birds of a feather flock together.’”\n“Only mustard isn’t a bird,” Alice remarked.\n“Right, as usual,” said the Duchess: “what a clear way you have of putting things!”\n“It’s a mineral, I think,” said Alice.\n“Of course it is,” said the Duchess, who seemed ready to agree to everything that Alice said; “there’s a large mustard-mine near here. And the moral of that is—‘The more there is of mine, the less there is of yours.’”\n“Oh, I know!” exclaimed Alice, who had not attended to this last remark, “it’s a vegetable. It doesn’t look like one, but it is.”\n“I quite agree with you,” said the Duchess; “and the moral of that is—‘Be what you would seem to be’—or if you’d like it put more simply—‘Never imagine yourself not to be otherwise than what it might appear to others that what you were or might have been was not otherwise than what you had been would have appeared to them to be otherwise.’”\n“I think I should understand that better,” Alice said very politely, “if I had it written down: but I can’t quite follow it as you say it.”\n“That’s nothing to what I could say if I chose,” the Duchess replied, in a pleased tone.\n“Pray don’t trouble yourself to say it any longer than that,” said Alice.\n“Oh, don’t talk about trouble!” said the Duchess. “I make you a present of everything I’ve said as yet.”\n“A cheap sort of present!” thought Alice. “I’m glad they don’t give birthday presents like that!” But she did not venture to say it out loud.\n“Thinking again?” the Duchess asked, with another dig of her sharp little chin.\n“I’ve a right to think,” said Alice sharply, for she was beginning to feel a little worried.\n“Just about as much right,” said the Duchess, “as pigs have to fly; and the m—”",
          "paraphrase_gemini-2.5-flash-preview-04-17": "“Oh, I’m so happy to see you again, my dear old friend!” the Duchess exclaimed, wrapping her arm around Alice’s and walking alongside her. Alice was relieved to find the Duchess in such a pleasant mood and suspected the previous harshness might have been caused by pepper in the kitchen. Thinking to herself, though without much conviction, Alice decided, “When I become a Duchess, I won’t allow any pepper in my kitchen at all. Soup is perfectly fine without it. Perhaps,” she continued, feeling pleased with her new theory, “pepper is what makes people irritable, vinegar makes them sour, chamomile makes them bitter, and things like barley sugar make children sweet-tempered. If only people knew this, they might not be so stingy with the sweet things.” She had become so engrossed in her thoughts that she had completely forgotten the Duchess and was startled when she heard her voice right next to her. “You’re lost in thought, dear, which is why you’ve stopped talking. I can’t recall the moral of that right now, but it will come back to me shortly.” “Maybe there isn’t a moral,” Alice suggested tentatively. “Nonsense, child!” the Duchess retorted, pressing herself even closer to Alice’s side as she spoke. “Everything has a moral if you just look for it.” Alice didn’t particularly enjoy the Duchess being so close, partly because she was quite unattractive, and also because her sharp chin rested uncomfortably on Alice’s shoulder. However, wanting to be polite, she tolerated it. “The game seems to be going a bit better now,” Alice said, trying to keep the conversation going. “Indeed it is,” the Duchess replied, adding, “and the moral of that is—‘Oh, it’s love, it’s love, that makes the world go ’round!’” “Someone said,” Alice whispered, “that the world goes ’round because everyone attends to their own affairs!” “Ah, well! That means roughly the same thing,” the Duchess said, nudging her sharp chin into Alice’s shoulder again as she continued, “and the moral of *that* is—‘Focus on the meaning, and the words will take care of themselves.’” “She certainly loves finding morals in everything!” Alice thought privately. “I expect you’re wondering why I’m not putting my arm around your waist,” the Duchess said after a brief silence. “The reason is, I’m not sure how your flamingo will react. Should I try?” “He might bite,” Alice answered carefully, not eager to test the idea. “Quite right,” the Duchess agreed. “Flamingos and mustard both bite. And the moral of that is—‘Birds of a feather flock together.’” “But mustard isn’t a bird,” Alice pointed out. “Correct, as always,” the Duchess said. “You have such a clear way of expressing things!” “I believe it’s a mineral,” Alice stated. “Of course it is,” said the Duchess, seemingly ready to agree with anything Alice said. “There’s a large mustard mine nearby. And the moral of that is—‘The more I have, the less you have.’” “Oh, I know!” Alice exclaimed, not having paid attention to the last comment. “It’s a vegetable. It doesn’t look like one, but it is.” “I completely agree with you,” the Duchess said. “And the moral of that is—‘Be what you appear to be’—or to put it more simply—‘Never imagine yourself to be anything other than what it might seem to others that what you were or could have been was not different from what you had been would have appeared to them to be different.’” “I think I’d understand that better,” Alice said very politely, “if it were written down. I can’t quite keep track of it when you say it.” “That’s nothing compared to what I *could* say if I wanted to,” the Duchess replied, sounding pleased. “Please don’t bother to say anything longer than that,” Alice requested. “Oh, don’t mention bother!” the Duchess exclaimed. “Consider everything I’ve said so far a gift to you.” “What a cheap gift!” Alice thought. “I’m glad birthday presents aren’t like that!” But she didn’t dare say it aloud. “Thinking again?” the Duchess asked, giving Alice another poke with her sharp chin. “I have a right to think,” Alice replied sharply, starting to feel a bit irritated. “Only about as much right,” the Duchess said, “as pigs have to fly; and the mo—”",
          "paraphrase_gpt-4.1-2025-04-14": "“I can't tell you how happy I am to see you again, my dear!” exclaimed the Duchess, affectionately slipping her arm through Alice’s as they strolled away together. Alice was very pleased to find the Duchess in such a good mood, and wondered if perhaps it was just the pepper that made her so angry when they first met in the kitchen. “When I'm a Duchess,” Alice thought (though not very confidently), “I won’t have any pepper in my kitchen at all. Soup tastes just fine without it—maybe pepper is what makes people lose their tempers,” she mused happily at having discovered a new principle, “and vinegar makes people sour—camomile makes them bitter—and things like barley-sugar make children cheerful. I wish people knew that; maybe then they wouldn’t be so stingy with them.” By this time, Alice had completely forgotten about the Duchess, until she was startled by her voice close to her ear. “You’re deep in thought, my dear, and that’s why you’ve forgotten to speak. I don’t know just now what the lesson in that is, but I’ll recall it in a moment.” “Maybe there isn’t one,” Alice suggested. “Nonsense, child!” said the Duchess. “There’s a moral to everything, if you can find it.” She snuggled up even closer to Alice as she spoke. Alice wasn’t very comfortable with this closeness: firstly, because the Duchess was quite ugly, and secondly, because her chin, at just the right height, rested sharply on Alice’s shoulder. Still, not wishing to be rude, Alice put up with it as best she could. “The game’s going a bit better now,” she offered, trying to keep up a conversation. “It is indeed,” agreed the Duchess, “and the moral is—‘It’s love that makes the world go round!’” “Someone told me,” Alice whispered, “that it happens because everyone minds their own business!” “Well, that amounts to the same thing,” said the Duchess, poking Alice’s shoulder with her pointed chin as she continued, “and the moral there is—‘Take care of the sense, and the sounds will sort themselves out.’” “She really loves finding morals in everything!” Alice thought to herself. After a pause, the Duchess remarked, “Maybe you wonder why I don't put my arm around your waist. It’s because I'm not sure about your flamingo’s mood. Should I give it a try?” “He might bite,” replied Alice cautiously, not wanting her to try. “Very true,” said the Duchess. “Flamingoes and mustard both bite. And the lesson in that is—‘Birds of a feather flock together.’” “But mustard isn’t a bird,” Alice pointed out. “As usual, you’re right,” said the Duchess. “You explain things so clearly!” “I think it’s a mineral,” Alice said. “Of course,” the Duchess replied, quick to agree. “There’s a big mustard mine nearby. And the moral there is—‘The more I have, the less there is for you.’” “Oh, I know!” Alice exclaimed (not listening to the last statement), “It’s a vegetable. It doesn’t look like one, but it is.” “Absolutely,” agreed the Duchess, “and the moral is—‘Be what you seem’—or, to put it more plainly—‘Never pretend to be something you’re not, or give others reason to think you’re different from what you actually are.’” “I think I’d understand that better if it was written down,” Alice said politely, “because I can’t quite follow when you say it.” “That’s nothing compared to what I could say if I wanted to,” the Duchess replied happily. “Please don’t trouble yourself to say more,” said Alice. “Oh, don’t mention it!” replied the Duchess. “Everything I’ve said so far is yours as a gift.” “Not a very valuable present!” Alice thought. “I’m glad birthday presents aren’t like that!” But she didn’t dare say it aloud. “Thinking again?” the Duchess asked, giving another poke with her sharp chin. “I have every right to think,” Alice replied curtly, beginning to get annoyed. “Just as much right as pigs have to fly; and the m—”"

Alice glanced up and saw the Queen standing directly in front of them, arms crossed and wearing a severe, storm-like frown. The Duchess timidly started, \"A lovely day, Your Majesty!\" The Queen immediately shouted, stamping her foot as she spoke, \"Listen closely, this is your only warning! You or your head must be gone, and that has to happen almost instantly! Make your decision!\" The Duchess made her choice and vanished instantly. The Queen then told Alice, \"Let's continue playing the game,\" and Alice, too terrified to speak, quietly followed her back to the croquet area. The other participants had taken advantage of the Queen's absence to relax in the shade; however, the moment they spotted her, they hurried back to the game. The Queen simply commented that delaying even for a moment would cost them their lives. Throughout the game, the Queen constantly bickered with the other players, yelling things like \"Cut off his head!\" or \"Cut off her head!\" Those she condemned were taken into custody by the soldiers, who naturally had to stop acting as arches to perform these arrests. As a result, within about half an hour, no arches remained, and every player except the King, the Queen, and Alice had been arrested and sentenced to be executed. At this point, the Queen, exhausted and panting, stopped and asked Alice, \"Have you encountered the Mock Turtle yet?\"",

The Duchess’s arm, which was linked with Alice’s, started shaking. Looking up, Alice saw the Queen standing in front of them, arms crossed and scowling fiercely. The Duchess tried to greet the Queen politely, albeit in a nervous and quiet voice. The Queen, however, angrily stomped her foot and warned that either the Duchess must leave or she would lose her head immediately. Faced with this, the Duchess quickly made her escape. The Queen then told Alice to continue the game, and though Alice was too frightened to speak, she obediently followed her back to the croquet field. While the Queen had been away, the other guests had relaxed in the shade, but when she returned they hastily resumed the game since she warned them that any delay might cost them their lives. Throughout the game, the Queen kept arguing with the players and frequently ordered, 'Off with his head!' or 'Off with her head!' Those she condemned were arrested by the soldiers, who had to stop being croquet arches in order to do so. After about half an hour, no arches remained, and everyone except the King, the Queen, and Alice had been taken into custody and were sentenced to be executed. At last, out of breath, the Queen paused and asked Alice if she had met the Mock Turtle yet."

Never heard of uglifying!” it exclaimed. “You know what to beautify is, I suppose?”\n“Yes,” said Alice doubtfully: “it means—to—make—anything—prettier.”\n“Well, then,” the Gryphon went on, “if you don’t know what to uglify is, you are a simpleton.”\nAlice did not feel encouraged to ask any more questions about it, so she turned to the Mock Turtle, and said “What else had you to learn?”\n“Well, there was Mystery,” the Mock Turtle replied, counting off the subjects on his flappers, “—Mystery, ancient and modern, with Seaography: then Drawling—the Drawling-master was an old conger-eel, that used to come once a week: he taught us Drawling, Stretching, and Fainting in Coils.”\n“What was that like?” said Alice.\n“Well, I can’t show it you myself,” the Mock Turtle said: “I’m too stiff. And the Gryphon never learnt it.”\n“Hadn’t time,” said the Gryphon: “I went to the Classics master, though. He was an old crab, he was.”\n“I never went to him,” the Mock Turtle said with a sigh: “he taught Laughing and Grief, they used to say.”\n“So he did, so he did,” said the Gryphon, sighing in his turn; and both creatures hid their faces in their paws.\n“And how many hours a day did you do lessons?” said Alice, in a hurry to change the subject.\n“Ten hours the first day,” said the Mock Turtle: “nine the next, and so on.”\n“What a curious plan!” exclaimed Alice.\n“That’s the reason they’re called lessons,” the Gryphon remarked: “because they lessen from day to day.”\nThis was quite a new idea to Alice, and she thought it over a little before she made her next remark. “Then the eleventh day must have been a holiday?”\n“Of course it was,” said the Mock Turtle.\n“And how did you manage on the twelfth?” Alice went on eagerly.\n“That’s enough about lessons,” the Gryphon interrupted in a very decided tone: “tell her something about the games now.”",

Never heard of making things ugly!\" it exclaimed. \"You know what it means to beautify, I assume?\" \"Yes,\" Alice said uncertainly, \"it means—to—make—anything—look—nicer.\" \"Well, then,\" the Gryphon continued, \"if you don't know what it is to make something ugly, you *are* indeed a simpleton.\" Alice did not feel encouraged to ask any further questions about that, so she turned to the Mock Turtle and said, \"What else were you required to study?\" \"Well, there was Mystery,\" the Mock Turtle replied, counting the subjects on his flippers, \"—Mystery, both ancient and modern, along with Seaography. Then Drawling—the Drawling teacher was an old conger-eel who visited once a week: *he* taught us Drawling, Stretching, and Fainting while Coiled.\" \"What was *that* like?\" asked Alice. \"Well, I can't demonstrate it myself,\" the Mock Turtle said. \"I'm too stiff now.

Alice almost thanked him for the story, thinking it was over, but figured there must be more and stayed quiet.\n\nAfter a while, the Mock Turtle continued, a bit calmer, though still sobbing now and then, explaining that when they were young, they went to school under the sea, taught by an old Turtle called Tortoise. Alice asked why the teacher was called Tortoise if he was a Turtle, and the Mock Turtle curtly replied that it was because he “taught us,” calling her slow for not understanding. The Gryphon agreed, making Alice feel embarrassed. The Gryphon told the Mock Turtle to get on with his tale.\n\nThe Mock Turtle resumed, insisting they really did go to school underwater, despite what Alice might think—though she protested that she never doubted it. The Gryphon snapped at Alice to be quiet and let the Mock Turtle finish.\n\nHe described their excellent education, saying they went to school daily. Alice said she’d been to a day school too, so there was nothing special about that. The Mock Turtle inquired if she took extra subjects. Alice replied that she’d learned French and music, but not washing. The Mock Turtle declared her school must not have been very good then, because in his school, “French, music, and washing” were extras. Alice pointed out that living under the sea made learning washing seem unnecessary, but the Mock Turtle said he couldn’t afford the extras and just did the standard course.\n\nAlice asked what the ordinary subjects were, and the Mock Turtle replied, “Reeling and Writhing” to start with, followed by different kinds of Arithmetic: Ambition, Distraction, Uglification, and Derision. Alice said she’d never heard of Uglification, so the Gryphon dramatically called her ignorant and explained that, as she knew what “beautify” meant, “uglify” was its opposite, implying Alice was foolish for asking.\n\nDiscouraged, Alice asked what else they learned. The Mock Turtle listed “Mystery, ancient and modern, and Seaography, then Drawling” taught to them by an old conger-eel once a week, who instructed them in Drawling, Stretching, and Fainting in Coils. When Alice asked what that entailed, the Mock Turtle said he couldn’t demonstrate because he was too stiff, and the Gryphon hadn’t learned it either, as he was studying with the Classics teacher, an old crab who taught Laughing and Grief. The Mock Turtle said he never studied with that teacher, but they both remembered the crab’s lessons with sighs.\n\nTrying to change the subject, Alice asked how many hours they had lessons. The Mock Turtle said ten hours the first day, nine the next, and so on. Alice commented that it was a strange system. The Gryphon explained, “That’s why they’re called lessons—because they lessen day by day.” This was a totally new idea for Alice, and she thought about it carefully before asking if the eleventh day was a holiday, which the Mock Turtle confirmed. She wanted to know about the twelfth day, but the Gryphon cut her off, insisting that was enough about lessons and they should talk about the games instead."

She also mentioned how much she liked the peculiar song about the whiting. The Mock Turtle then brought up the topic of whitings, asking if Alice had seen them. Alice confirmed she had, adding that she'd often encountered them at 'dinn—' but quickly stopped herself. The Mock Turtle, not understanding where 'Dinn' might be, assumed that since Alice had seen them so frequently, she must know what they look like. Alice pondered for a moment before replying that she thought so, describing them as having their tails in their mouths and being covered in crumbs. The Mock Turtle corrected her about the crumbs, stating they would wash off in the sea. However, he agreed about the tails in their mouths and began to explain the reason but stopped, yawning and closing his eyes. He instructed the Gryphon to explain the rest. The Gryphon then revealed the reason: the whiting wanted to join the lobsters at the dance. Consequently, they were thrown into the sea and had a long way to fall, which resulted in their tails getting firmly stuck in their mouths, unable to be removed. That was the whole story. Alice thanked them, calling it very interesting and admitting she had never known so much about a whiting before. The Gryphon offered to share more information, asking if she knew why it was called a whiting. Alice confessed she hadn't thought about it and asked for the reason. The Gryphon stated very seriously that it 'does the boots and shoes.' Alice was completely bewildered and repeated 'Does the boots and shoes!' in a tone of disbelief. The Gryphon challenged her, asking what her own shoes were 'done with,' meaning what made them shiny. Alice looked at her shoes, considering her answer carefully before replying that she believed they were done with blacking. The Gryphon continued in a deep voice that boots and shoes under the sea are done with a whiting, declaring 'Now you know.' Curious, Alice asked what undersea boots and shoes were made of. The Gryphon replied somewhat impatiently that they were obviously made of 'soles and eels,' adding that 'any shrimp could have told you that.' Alice, still thinking about the song, remarked that if she had been the whiting, she would have told the porpoise to stay back, saying, 'Keep back, please: we don’t want you with us!' The Mock Turtle explained that they were forced to include him because no intelligent fish would go anywhere without a porpoise. Alice expressed great surprise, asking if that were truly the case. The Mock Turtle confirmed it, elaborating that if a fish came to him proposing a journey, he would ask 'With what porpoise?' Alice questioned if he meant 'purpose.' The Mock Turtle insisted he meant exactly what he said, sounding offended. The Gryphon then interrupted, suggesting they hear about Alice's adventures instead.",

But they do have their tails in their mouths, and the reason—\" Here, the Mock Turtle yawned and closed his eyes. \"Gryphon, why don't you explain the reason?\"\n\n\"The reason is,\" said the Gryphon, \"they wanted to join the lobsters in the dance. So they were thrown out to sea and had to drop a long way down. That made their tails get stuck in their mouths, and they couldn't take them out. That's it.\"\n\n\"Thank you,\" said Alice, \"that was very interesting. I didn't know so much about whiting before.\"\n\n\"I can tell you even more,\" offered the Gryphon. \"Do you know why they're called 'whiting'?\"\n\n\"I've never thought about it,\" admitted Alice. \"Why?\"\n\n\"Because they polish boots and shoes,\" the Gryphon said with importance.\n\nAlice was completely baffled. \"They polish boots and shoes!\" she repeated, confused.\n\n\"Well, what are your shoes polished with?\" asked the Gryphon. \"What makes them shine?\"\n\nAlice glanced at her shoes and thought for a moment. \"With blacking, I think.\"\n\n\"Under the sea, boots and shoes are polished with whiting. Now you know,\" continued the Gryphon.\n\n\"And what are they made of?\" Alice asked curiously.\n\n\"Of soles and eels, of course; any shrimp could tell you that,\" answered the Gryphon impatiently.\n\n\"If I were the whiting,\" said Alice, still remembering the song, \"I would have told the porpoise to stay back; we don't need you!\"\n\n\"They had to have him,\" said the Mock Turtle. \"No sensible fish would travel anywhere without a porpoise.\"\n\n\"Really?\" Alice said in surprise.\n\n\"Of course not,\" responded the Mock Turtle. \"If a fish told me he was going on a trip, I'd ask, 'With what porpoise?'\"\n\n\"Don't you mean 'purpose'?\" said Alice.\n\n\"I said what I meant,\" retorted the Mock Turtle, sounding offended.

The adventures first,” said the Gryphon in an impatient tone: “explanations take such a dreadful time.”\nSo Alice began telling them her adventures from the time when she first saw the White Rabbit. She was a little nervous about it just at first, the two creatures got so close to her, one on each side, and opened their eyes and mouths so very wide, but she gained courage as she went on. Her listeners were perfectly quiet till she got to the part about her repeating “You are old, Father William,” to the Caterpillar, and the words all coming different, and then the Mock Turtle drew a long breath, and said “That’s very curious.”\n“It’s all about as curious as it can be,” said the Gryphon.\n“It all came different!” the Mock Turtle repeated thoughtfully. “I should like to hear her try and repeat something now.

The Mock Turtle requested clarification on this statement, but the Gryphon quickly interjected impatiently, saying the adventures should come first because explanations consume an excessive amount of time. So, Alice began narrating her experiences from the moment she first encountered the White Rabbit. She felt a bit anxious initially, seeing the two creatures lean in so closely on either side, fixing her with wide-open eyes and mouths, but her confidence grew as she continued her story. Her listeners remained completely silent until she reached the part where she mentioned reciting “You are old, Father William” to the Caterpillar and how the words unexpectedly came out differently. At this point, the Mock Turtle took a deep breath and remarked that it was \"very peculiar.\" The Gryphon agreed, stating that it was \"as peculiar as anything could possibly be.\" The Mock Turtle repeated the idea that it \"all came out differently\" in a thoughtful manner, then expressed a desire to hear her attempt to recite something immediately. He instructed the Gryphon to tell her to start, looking at him as if the Gryphon held some authority over Alice. The Gryphon then commanded her, \"Stand up and recite ‘Tis the voice of the sluggard.’” Alice internally mused about how the creatures bossed her around and made her repeat lessons, feeling as though she was back at school. Nevertheless, she stood up and began the recitation, but her mind was so preoccupied with the Lobster Quadrille that she was barely aware of what she was saying, resulting in the words coming out in a very strange way: \"’Tis the voice of the Lobster; I heard him declare, “You have baked me too brown, I must sugar my hair.” As a duck with its eyelids, so he with his nose Trims his belt and his buttons, and turns out his toes.\"",

So Alice started recounting her adventures from when she first encountered the White Rabbit. Though she was nervous at first, as the Mock Turtle and Gryphon got very close to her and stared wide-eyed and open-mouthed, she grew more confident as she spoke. They listened quietly until Alice mentioned reciting \"You are old, Father William\" to the Caterpillar, only for the words to come out all wrong. The Mock Turtle exclaimed that it was very strange, and the Gryphon agreed. The Mock Turtle, interested, suggested she try another recitation, prompting the Gryphon to order Alice to stand and recite \"'Tis the voice of the sluggard.\" Alice grumbled to herself about being given orders and made to repeat lessons like she was at school, but did as told. However, her mind was so distracted by thoughts of the Lobster Quadrille that her recitation came out jumbled and nonsensical, starting with, “’Tis the voice of the Lobster; I heard him declare, ‘You have baked me too brown, I must sugar my hair.’ As a duck with its eyelids, so he with his nose Trims his belt and his buttons, and turns out his toes.”"

In the very center of the courtroom was a table displaying a big dish of tarts, which looked so delicious that Alice felt quite hungry just seeing them. She wished they would hurry up and finish the trial so they could serve the refreshments. However, seeing no sign of this happening, she started examining everything around her to occupy the time. Alice had never been inside a court of law before, but she had learned about them from reading books and was pleased to recognize the purpose of almost everything present. Pointing to one figure, she told herself that must be the judge because of his prominent wig. It turned out the King was serving as the judge; he wore his crown over his wig, which looked uncomfortable and certainly didn't suit him well. Alice then identified the jury box and the twelve individuals inside – whom she referred to as \"creatures\" because some were animals and some were birds – as the jurors. She repeated the word \"jurors\" to herself a couple of times, feeling somewhat proud, as she correctly believed few girls her age would know its meaning. Although, calling them \"jury-men\" would have been equally fine.",

The Knave stood before them in chains, flanked by a guard on each side. Next to the King stood the White Rabbit, holding a trumpet and a scroll of parchment. At the center of the courtroom sat a table topped with a big plate of tarts, which looked so delicious that they made Alice hungry just by looking at them. She wished the trial would end soon so they would serve refreshments, but realizing that wasn't likely, Alice started to amuse herself by observing her surroundings. Although Alice had never attended a courtroom before, she recalled what she had read in books and was pleased to recognize many of the things there, such as the judge—who was the King himself, wearing a rather uncomfortable and unbecoming crown and wig together. Alice also identified the jury box and noted the twelve occupants inside as 'creatures' since they included both animals and birds, and she was proud to know they were called 'jurors,' a word she repeated to herself because she thought few girls her age would know it, although 'jury-men' would have worked, too."

Go on!”\n“I’m a poor man,” the Hatter went on, “and most things twinkled after that—only the March Hare said—”\n“I didn’t!” the March Hare interrupted in a great hurry.\n“You did!” said the Hatter.\n“I deny it!” said the March Hare.\n“He denies it,” said the King: “leave out that part.”\n“Well, at any rate, the Dormouse said—” the Hatter went on, looking anxiously round to see if he would deny it too: but the Dormouse denied nothing, being fast asleep.\n“After that,” continued the Hatter, “I cut some more bread-and-butter—”\n“But what did the Dormouse say?” one of the jury asked.\n“That I can’t remember,” said the Hatter.\n“You must remember,” remarked the King, “or I’ll have you executed.”\nThe miserable Hatter dropped his teacup and bread-and-butter, and went down on one knee. “I’m a poor man, your Majesty,” he began.\n“You’re a very poor speaker,” said the King.\nHere one of the guinea-pigs cheered, and was immediately suppressed by the officers of the court. (As that is rather a hard word, I will just explain to you how it was done. They had a large canvas bag, which tied up at the mouth with strings: into this they slipped the guinea-pig, head first, and then sat upon it.)\n“I’m glad I’ve seen that done,” thought Alice. “I’ve so often read in the newspapers, at the end of trials, “There was some attempts at applause, which was immediately suppressed by the officers of the court,” and I never understood what it meant till now.”\n“If that’s all you know about it, you may stand down,” continued the King.\n“I can’t go no lower,” said the Hatter: “I’m on the floor, as it is.”\n“Then you may sit down,” the King replied.\nHere the other guinea-pig cheered, and was suppressed.\n“Come, that finished the guinea-pigs!” thought Alice. “Now we shall get on better.”\n“I’d rather finish my tea,” said the Hatter, with an anxious look at the Queen, who was reading the list of singers.\n“You may go,” said the King, and the Hatter hurriedly left the court, without even waiting to put his shoes on.\n“—and just take his head off outside,” the Queen added to one of the officers: but the Hatter was out of sight before the officer could get to the door.",
          "paraphrase_gemini-2.5-flash-preview-04-17": "Throughout this time, the Queen had focused her gaze intently on the Hatter. Just as the Dormouse was making his way across the courtroom, she instructed one of her officers, \"Fetch me the roster of singers from the last concert!\" At this, the unfortunate Hatter began shaking uncontrollably, causing his shoes to fall off. The King angrily restated his command, \"Present your testimony, or I will have you executed immediately, regardless of your nervousness.\" The Hatter started speaking in a trembling voice, protesting, \"I'm just a simple man, Your Majesty, and I hadn't properly started my tea—it's only been about a week—and with the bread-and-butter slicing so thin—and the tea starting to twinkle—\" The King interrupted, demanding, \"Starting to twinkle of the what?\" The Hatter replied, \"It began with the tea.\" \"Naturally, 'twinkling' starts with a 'T'!\" the King exclaimed sharply. \"Do you take me for an idiot? Get on with it!\" The Hatter continued, \"I'm a poor man, and after that, most things seemed to twinkle—except the March Hare said—\" \"I did not!\" the March Hare hastily cut in. \"You most certainly did!\" insisted the Hatter. \"I deny it completely!\" declared the March Hare. \"He denies it,\" said the King. \"Leave out that part.\" \"Well, anyway, the Dormouse said—\" the Hatter went on, glancing around nervously to see if the Dormouse would also deny it, but the Dormouse denied nothing, being sound asleep. \"Following that,\" the Hatter proceeded, \"I cut some more bread-and-butter—\" \"But what precisely did the Dormouse say?\" one of the jurors inquired. \"I cannot recall,\" the Hatter admitted. \"You absolutely must remember,\" the King insisted, \"or I shall have you executed.\" The distraught Hatter dropped his teacup and bread-and-butter and knelt down. \"I'm a poor man, Your Majesty,\" he began again. \"You are a remarkably bad speaker,\" the King commented. At this point, one of the guinea-pigs let out a cheer and was instantly quieted by the court officers. (Since that word might be difficult, I will explain how it was done. They had a large canvas bag with drawstrings at the opening. They would shove the guinea-pig into it, head first, and then sit on the bag.) \"I'm glad I finally saw that happen,\" Alice thought. \"I've often read in newspaper accounts of trials, 'There were some attempts at applause, which the officers of the court immediately suppressed,' and I never knew what it meant until now.\" \"If that's the extent of your knowledge on the matter, you may step down,\" the King continued. \"I can't descend any lower,\" the Hatter replied. \"I'm already on the floor.\" \"Then you are permitted to sit down,\" the King said. The other guinea-pig cheered here and was likewise suppressed. \"Good, that should put an end to the guinea-pigs!\" Alice thought. \"Now we should make better progress.\" \"I'd prefer to finish my tea,\" said the Hatter, casting an anxious look at the Queen, who was reading the list of singers. \"You are dismissed,\" the King announced, and the Hatter hurried out of the courtroom without even stopping to retrieve his shoes. \"—and see that his head is removed outside,\" the Queen added to an officer. However, the Hatter was already out of sight before the officer could even reach the door.",

Continue!”\n\n“I’m a poor man,” repeated the Hatter, “and after that everything twinkled—except the March Hare said—”\n\n“I did not!” interrupted the March Hare quickly.\n\n“You did!” insisted the Hatter.\n\n“I deny it!” said the March Hare.\n\n“He denies it,” said the King. “Ignore that part.”\n\n“In any case, the Dormouse said—” the Hatter continued, glancing around to see if the Dormouse would object, but the Dormouse was fast asleep and said nothing.\n\n“After that,” said the Hatter, “I cut some more bread-and-butter—”\n\n“What did the Dormouse say?” one juror asked.\n\n“I can’t remember,” replied the Hatter.\n\n“You must remember,” insisted the King, “or I’ll have you executed.”\n\nTerrified, the Hatter dropped his teacup and bread-and-butter, and knelt before the King, repeating, “I’m a poor man, your Majesty.”\n\n“You’re a poor speaker,” retorted the King.\n\nAt this, one of the guinea-pigs cheered and was quickly silenced by the court officials. (Since that’s a tricky word, let me explain: they had a big canvas bag tied with strings, into which the guinea-pig was slipped headfirst before the officials sat on it.)\n\n“I’m glad I got to see that,” Alice thought. “I often read that applause was immediately suppressed by the officers at the end of trials, but I never understood what that meant until now.”\n\n“If that’s all you have to say, you may step down,” the King said.\n\n“I can’t get any lower,” replied the Hatter, “I’m already on the floor.”\n\n“Then sit down,” the King instructed.\n\nJust then, the other guinea-pig cheered and was also suppressed.\n\n“That’s the end of the guinea-pigs!” Alice thought. “Things should move more smoothly now.”\n\n“I’d rather finish my tea,” the Hatter said, glancing nervously at the Queen, who was reading the list of singers.\n\n“You may go,” said the King, and the Hatter fled the courtroom in haste, not even stopping to retrieve his shoes.\n\n“And just have his head removed outside,” the Queen told an officer, but the Hatter had already vanished before the officer got to the door."
