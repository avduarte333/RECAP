   "how brave they ’ ll all think me at home why i wouldn ’ t say anything about it even if i fell off the top of the house ” ( which was very likely true ) down down down would the fall never come to an end “ i wonder how many miles i ’ ve fallen by this time ” she said aloud “ i must be getting somewhere near the centre of the earth let me see that would be four thousand miles down i think ” ( for you see alice had learnt several things of this sort in her lessons in the schoolroom and though this was not a very good opportunity for showing off her knowledge as there was no one to listen to her still it was good practice to say it over ) “ yes that ’ s about the right distancebut then i wonder what latitude or longitude i ’ ve got to ” ( alice had no idea what latitude was or longitude either but thought they were nice grand words to say ) presently she began again “ i wonder if i shall fall right through the earth how funny it ’ ll seem to come out among the people that walk with their heads downward the antipathies i think ” ( she was rather glad there was no one listening this time as it didn ’ t sound at all the right word ) “ but i shall have to ask them what the name of the country is you know please ma ’ am is this new zealand or australia ” ( and she tried to curtsey as she spokefancy curtseying as you ’ re falling through the air do you think you could manage it ) “ and what an ignorant little girl she ’ ll think me for asking no it ’ ll never do to ask perhaps i shall see it written up somewhere ” down down down there was nothing else to do so alice soon began talking again “ dinah ’ ll miss me very much tonight i should think ” ( dinah was the cat ) “ i hope they ’ ll remember her saucer of milk at teatime dinah my dear i wish you were down here with me there are no mice in the air i ’ m afraid but you might catch a bat and that ’ s very like a mouse you know but do cats eat bats i wonder ” and here alice began to get rather sleepy and went on saying to herself in a dreamy sort of way “ do cats eat bats do cats eat bats ” and sometimes “ do bats eat cats ” for you see as she couldn ’ t answer either question it didn ’ t much matter which way she put it she felt that she was"

   "“ if it had grown up ” she said to herself “ it would have made a dreadfully ugly child but it makes rather a handsome pig i think ” and she began thinking over other children she knew who might do very well as pigs and was just saying to herself “ if one only knew the right way to change them ” when she was a little startled by seeing the cheshire cat sitting on a bough of a tree a few yards off the cat only grinned when it saw alice it looked goodnatured she thought still it had very long claws and a great many teeth so she felt that it ought to be treated with respect “ cheshire puss ” she began rather timidly as she did not at all know whether it would like the name however it only grinned a little wider “ come it ’ s pleased so far ” thought alice and she went on “ would you tell me please which way i ought to go from here ” “ that depends a good deal on where you want to get to ” said the cat “ i don ’ t much care where ” said alice “ then it doesn ’ t matter which way you go ” said the cat “ so long as i get somewhere ” alice added as an explanation “ oh you ’ re sure to do that ” said the cat “ if you only walk long enough ” alice felt that this could not be denied so she tried another question “ what sort of people live about here ” “ in that direction ” the cat said waving its right paw round “ lives a hatter and in that direction ” waving the other paw “ lives a march hare visit either you like they ’ re both mad ”"

   "there was no “ one two three and away ” but they began running when they liked and left off when they liked so that it was not easy to know when the race was over however when they had been running half an hour or so and were quite dry again the dodo suddenly called out “ the race is over ” and they all crowded round it panting and asking “ but who has won ” this question the dodo could not answer without a great deal of thought and it sat for a long time with one finger pressed upon its forehead ( the position in which you usually see shakespeare in the pictures of him ) while the rest waited in silence at last the dodo said “ everybody has won and all must have prizes ” “ but who is to give the prizes ” quite a chorus of voices asked “ why she of course ” said the dodo pointing to alice with one finger and the whole party at once crowded round her calling out in a confused way “ prizes prizes ” alice had no idea what to do and in despair she put her hand in her pocket and pulled out a box of comfits ( luckily the salt water had not got into it ) and handed them round as prizes there was exactly one apiece all round “ but she must have a prize herself you know ” said the mouse “ of course ” the dodo replied very gravely “ what else have you got in your pocket ” he went on turning to alice “ only a thimble ” said alice sadly “ hand it over here ” said the"

   "so she was considering in her own mind ( as well as she could for the hot day made her feel very sleepy and stupid ) whether the pleasure of making a daisychain would be worth the trouble of getting up and picking the daisies when suddenly a white rabbit with pink eyes ran close by her there was nothing so very remarkable in that nor did alice think it so very much out of the way to hear the rabbit say to itself “ oh dear oh dear i shall be late ” ( when she thought it over afterwards it occurred to her that she ought to have wondered at this but at the time it all seemed quite natural ) but when the rabbit actually took a watch out of its waistcoatpocket and looked at it and then hurried on alice started to her feet for it flashed across her mind that she had never before seen a rabbit with either a waistcoatpocket or a watch to take out of it and burning with curiosity she ran across the field after it and fortunately was just in time to see it pop down a large rabbithole under the hedge in another moment down went alice after it never once considering how in the world she was to get"

   "and so it was indeed she was now only ten inches high and her face brightened up at the thought that she was now the right size for going through the little door into that lovely garden first however she waited for a few minutes to see if she was going to shrink any further she felt a little nervous about this “ for it might end you know ” said alice to herself “ in my going out altogether like a candle i wonder what i should be like then ” and she tried to fancy what the flame of a candle is like after the candle is blown out for she could not remember ever having seen such a thing after a while finding that nothing more happened she decided on going into the garden at once but alas for poor alice when she got to the door she found she had forgotten the little golden key and when she went back to the table for it she found she could not possibly reach it she could see it quite plainly through the glass and she tried her best to climb up one of the legs of the table but it was too slippery and when she had tired herself out"

   "either the locks were too large or the key was too small but at any rate it would not open any of them however on the second time round she came upon a low curtain she had not noticed before and behind it was a little door about fifteen inches high she tried the little golden key in the lock and to her great delight it fitted alice opened the door and found that it led into a small passage not much larger than a rathole she knelt down and looked along the passage into the loveliest garden you ever saw how she longed to get out of that dark hall and wander about among those beds of bright flowers and those cool fountains but she could not even get her head through the doorway “ and even if my head would go through ” thought poor alice “ it would be of very little use without my shoulders oh how i wish i could shut up like a telescope i think i could if i only knew how to begin ” for you see so many outoftheway things had happened lately that alice had begun to think that"
