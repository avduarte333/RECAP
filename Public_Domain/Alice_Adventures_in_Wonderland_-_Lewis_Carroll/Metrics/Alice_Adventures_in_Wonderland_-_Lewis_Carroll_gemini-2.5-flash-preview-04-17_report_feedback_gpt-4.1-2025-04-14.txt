   "alice was very glad to find her in such a pleasant temper and thought to herself that perhaps it was only the pepper that had made her so savage when they met in the kitchen “ when i ’ m a duchess ” she said to herself ( not in a very hopeful tone though ) “ i won ’ t have any pepper in my kitchen at all soup does very well withoutmaybe it ’ s always pepper that makes people hottempered ” she went on very much pleased at having found out a new kind of rule “ and vinegar that makes them sourand camomile that makes them bitterandand barleysugar and such things that make children sweettempered i only wish people knew that then they wouldn ’ t be so stingy about it you know ” she had quite forgotten the duchess by this time and was a little startled when she heard her voice close to her ear “ you ’ re thinking about something my dear and that makes you forget to talk i can ’ t tell you just now what the moral of that is but i shall remember it in a bit ” “ perhaps it hasn ’ t one ” alice ventured to remark “ tut tut child ” said the duchess “ everything ’ s got a moral if only you can find it ” and she squeezed herself up closer to alice ’ s side as she spoke alice did not much like keeping so close to her first because the duchess was very ugly and secondly because she was exactly the right height to rest her chin upon alice ’ s shoulder and it was an uncomfortably sharp chin however she did not like to be rude so she bore it as well as she could “ the game ’ s going on rather better now ” she said by way of keeping up the conversation a little “ ’ tis so ” said the duchess “ and the moral of that is ‘ oh ’ tis love ’ tis love that makes the world go round ’ ” “ somebody said ” alice whispered “ that it ’ s done by everybody minding their own business ” “ ah well it means much the same thing ” said the duchess digging her sharp little chin into alice ’ s shoulder as she added “ and the moral of that is ‘ take care of the sense and the sounds will take care of themselves ’ ” “ how fond she is of finding morals in things ” alice thought to herself “ i dare say you ’ re wondering why i don ’ t put my arm round your waist ” the duchess said after a pause “ the reason is that i ’ m doubtful about the temper of your flamingo shall i try the experiment ” “ he might bite ” alice cautiously replied not feeling at all anxious to have the experiment tried “ very true ” said the duchess “ flamingoes and mustard both bite and the moral of that is ‘ birds of a feather flock together ’ ” “ only mustard isn ’ t a bird ” alice remarked “ right as usual ” said the duchess “ what a clear way you have of putting things ” “ it ’ s a mineral i think ” said alice “ of course it is ” said the duchess who seemed ready to"

   "how brave they ’ ll all think me at home why i wouldn ’ t say anything about it even if i fell off the top of the house ” ( which was very likely true ) down down down would the fall never come to an end “ i wonder how many miles i ’ ve fallen by this time ” she said aloud “ i must be getting somewhere near the centre of the earth let me see that would be four thousand miles down i think ” ( for you see alice had learnt several things of this sort in her lessons in the schoolroom and though this was not a very good opportunity for showing off her knowledge as there was no one to listen to her still it was good practice to say it over ) “ yes that ’ s about the right distancebut then i wonder what latitude or longitude i ’ ve got to ” ( alice had no idea what latitude was or longitude either but thought they were nice grand words to say ) presently she began again “ i wonder if i shall fall right through the earth how funny it ’ ll seem to come out among the people that walk with their heads downward the antipathies i think ” ( she was rather glad there was no one listening this time as it didn ’ t sound at all the right word ) “ but i shall have to ask them what the name of the country is you know please ma ’ am is this new zealand or australia ” ( and she tried to curtsey as she spokefancy curtseying as you ’ re falling through the air do you think you could manage it ) “ and what an ignorant little girl she ’ ll think me for asking no it ’ ll never do to ask perhaps i shall see it written up somewhere ” down down down there was nothing else to do so alice soon began talking again “ dinah ’ ll miss me very much tonight i should think ” ( dinah was the cat ) “ i hope they ’ ll remember her saucer of milk at teatime dinah my dear i wish you were down here with me there are no mice in the air i ’ m afraid but you might catch a bat and that ’ s very like a mouse you know but do cats eat bats i wonder ” and here alice began to get rather sleepy and went on saying to herself in a"

   "them as if she had known them all her life indeed she had quite a long argument with the lory who at last turned sulky and would only say “ i am older than you and must know better ” and this alice would not allow without knowing how old it was and as the lory positively refused to tell its age there was no more to be said at last the mouse who seemed to be a person of authority among them called out “ sit down all of you and listen to me i ’ ll soon make you dry enough ” they all sat down at once in a large ring with the mouse in the middle alice kept her eyes anxiously fixed on it for she felt sure she would catch a bad cold if she did not get dry very soon “ ahem ” said the mouse with an important air “ are you all ready this is the driest thing i know silence all round if you please ‘ william the conqueror whose cause was favoured by the pope was soon submitted to by the english who wanted leaders and had been of late much accustomed to usurpation and conquest edwin and morcar the earls of mercia and northumbria ’ ” “ ugh ” said the lory with a shiver “ i beg your pardon ” said the mouse frowning but very politely “ did you speak ” “ not i ” said the lory hastily “ i thought you did ” said the mouse “ i proceed ‘ edwin and morcar the earls of mercia and northumbria declared for him and even stigand the patriotic archbishop of canterbury found it advisable ’ ” “ found what ” said the duck “ found it ” the mouse replied rather crossly “ of course you know what ‘ it ’ means ” “ i know what ‘ it ’ means well enough when i find a thing ” said the duck “ it ’ s generally a frog or a worm the question is what did the archbishop find ” the mouse did not notice this question but hurriedly went on “ ‘ found it advisable to go with edgar atheling to meet william and offer him the"

   "the poor little thing was snorting like a steamengine when she caught it and kept doubling itself up and straightening itself out again so that altogether for the first minute or two it was as much as she could do to hold it as soon as she had made out the proper way of nursing it ( which was to twist it up into a sort of knot and then keep tight hold of its right ear and left foot so as to prevent its undoing itself ) she carried it out into the open air “ if i don ’ t take this child away with me ” thought alice “ they ’ re sure to kill it in a day or two wouldn ’ t it be murder to leave it behind ” she said the last words out loud and the little thing grunted in reply ( it had left off sneezing by this time ) “ don ’ t grunt ” said alice “ that ’ s not at all a proper way of expressing yourself ” the baby grunted again and alice looked very anxiously into its face to see what was the matter with it there could be no doubt that it had a very turnup nose much more like a snout than a real nose also its eyes were getting extremely small for a baby altogether alice did not like the look of the thing at all “ but perhaps it was only sobbing ” she thought and looked into its eyes again to see if there were any tears no there were no tears “ if you ’ re going to turn into a pig my dear ” said alice seriously “ i ’ ll have nothing more to do with you mind now ” the poor little thing sobbed again ( or grunted it was impossible to say which ) and they went on for some while in silence alice was just beginning to think to herself “ now what am i to do with this creature when i get it home ” when it grunted again so violently that she looked down into its face in some alarm this time there"

   "there was no “ one two three and away ” but they began running when they liked and left off when they liked so that it was not easy to know when the race was over however when they had been running half an hour or so and were quite dry again the dodo suddenly called out “ the race is over ” and they all crowded round it panting and asking “ but who has won ” this question the dodo could not answer without a great deal of thought and it sat for a long time with one finger pressed upon its forehead ( the position in which you usually see shakespeare in the pictures of him ) while the rest waited in silence at last the dodo said “ everybody has won and all must have prizes ” “ but who is to give the prizes ” quite a chorus of voices asked “ why she of course ” said the dodo pointing to alice with one finger and the whole party at once crowded round her calling out in a confused way “ prizes prizes ” alice had no idea what to do and in despair she put her hand in her pocket and pulled out a box of comfits ( luckily the salt water had not got into it ) and handed them round as prizes there was exactly one apiece all round “ but she must have a prize herself you know ” said the mouse “ of course ” the dodo replied very gravely “ what else have you got in your pocket ” he went on turning to alice “ only a thimble ” said alice sadly “ hand it over here ” said the dodo then they all crowded round her once more while the dodo solemnly presented the thimble saying “ we beg your acceptance of this elegant thimble ” and when it had finished this short speech they all cheered alice thought the whole thing very absurd but they all looked so grave that she did"
