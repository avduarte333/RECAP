   "there was no “ one two three and away ” but they began running when they liked and left off when they liked so that it was not easy to know when the race was over however when they had been running half an hour or so and were quite dry again the dodo suddenly called out “ the race is over ” and they all crowded round it panting and asking “ but who has won ” this question the dodo could not answer without a great deal of thought and it sat for a long time with one finger pressed upon its forehead ( the position in which you usually see shakespeare in the pictures of him ) while the rest waited in silence at last the dodo said “ everybody has won and all must have prizes ” “ but who is to give the prizes ” quite a chorus of voices asked “ why she of course ” said the dodo pointing to alice with one finger and the whole party at once crowded round her calling out in a confused way “ prizes prizes ” alice had no idea what to do and in despair she put her hand in her pocket and pulled out a box of comfits ( luckily the salt water had not got into it ) and handed them round as prizes there was exactly one apiece all round “ but she must have a prize herself you know ” said the mouse “ of course ” the dodo replied very gravely “ what else have you got in your pocket ” he went on turning to alice “ only a thimble ” said alice sadly “ hand it over here ” said the dodo then they all crowded round her once more while the dodo solemnly presented the thimble saying “ we beg your acceptance of this elegant thimble ” and when it had finished this short speech they all cheered alice thought the whole thing very absurd but they all looked so grave that she did not"

   "the first question of course was how to get dry again they had a consultation about this and after a few minutes it seemed quite natural to alice to find herself talking familiarly with them as if she had known them all her life indeed she had quite a long argument with the lory who at last turned sulky and would only say “ i am older than you and must know better ” and this alice would not allow without knowing how old it was and as the lory positively refused to tell its age there was no more to be said at last the mouse who seemed to be a person of authority among them called out “ sit down all of you and listen to me i ’ ll soon make you dry enough ” they all sat down at once in a large ring with the mouse in the middle alice kept her eyes anxiously fixed on it for she felt sure she would catch a bad cold if she did not get dry very soon “ ahem ” said the mouse with an important air “ are you all ready this is the driest thing i know silence all round if you please ‘ william the conqueror whose cause was favoured by the pope was soon submitted to by the english who wanted leaders and had been of late much accustomed to usurpation and conquest edwin and morcar the earls of mercia and northumbria ’ ” “ ugh ” said the lory with a shiver “ i beg your pardon ” said the mouse frowning but very politely “ did you speak ” “ not i ” said the lory hastily “ i thought you did ” said the mouse"

   "an enormous puppy was looking down at her with large round eyes and feebly stretching out one paw trying to touch her “ poor little thing ” said alice in a coaxing tone and she tried hard to whistle to it but she was terribly frightened all the time at the thought that it might be hungry in which case it would be very likely to eat her up in spite of all her coaxing hardly knowing what she did she picked up a little bit of stick and held it out to the puppy whereupon the puppy jumped into the air off all its feet at once with a yelp of delight and rushed at the stick and made believe to worry it then alice dodged behind a great thistle to keep herself from being run over and the moment she appeared on the other side the puppy made another rush at the stick and tumbled head over heels in its hurry to get hold of it then alice thinking it was very like having a game of play with a carthorse and expecting every moment to be trampled under its feet ran round the thistle again then the puppy began a series of short charges at the stick running a very little way forwards each time and a long way back and barking hoarsely all the while till at last it sat down a good way off panting with its tongue hanging out of its mouth and its great eyes half shut this seemed to alice a good opportunity for making her escape so she set off at once and ran till she was quite tired and out of breath and till the puppy ’ s bark"

   "i don ’ t keep the same size for ten minutes together ” “ can ’ t remember what things ” said the caterpillar “ well i ’ ve tried to say “ how doth the little busy bee ” but it all came different ” alice replied in a very melancholy voice “ repeat “ you are old father william ’ ” said the caterpillar alice folded her hands and began “ you are old father william ” the young man said “ and your hair has become very white and yet you incessantly stand on your head do you think at your age it is right ” “ in my youth ” father william replied to his son “ i feared it might injure the brain but now that i ’ m perfectly sure i have none why i do it again and again ” “ you are old ” said the youth “ as i mentioned before and have grown most uncommonly fat yet you turned a backsomersault in at the door pray what is the reason of that ” “ in my youth ” said the sage as he shook his grey locks “ i kept all my limbs very supple by the use of this ointmentone shilling the box allow me to sell you a couple ” “ you are old ” said the youth “ and your jaws are too weak for anything tougher than suet yet you finished the goose with the bones and the beak pray how did you manage to do it ” “ in my youth ” said his father “ i took to the law and argued each case"

   "“ oh hush ” the rabbit whispered in a frightened tone “ the queen will hear you you see she came rather late and the queen said ” “ get to your places ” shouted the queen in a voice of thunder and people began running about in all directions tumbling up against each other however they got settled down in a minute or two and the game began alice thought she had never seen such a curious croquetground in her life it was all ridges and furrows the balls were live hedgehogs the mallets live flamingoes and the soldiers had to double themselves up and to stand on their hands and feet to make the arches the chief difficulty alice found at first was in managing her flamingo she succeeded in getting its body tucked away comfortably enough under her arm with its legs hanging down but generally just as she had got its neck nicely straightened out and was going to give the hedgehog a blow with its head it would twist itself round and look up in her face with such a puzzled expression that she could not help bursting out laughing and when she had got its head down and was going to begin again it was very provoking to find that the hedgehog had unrolled itself and was in the act of crawling away besides all this there was generally a ridge or furrow in the way wherever she wanted to send the hedgehog to and as the doubledup soldiers were always getting up and walking off to other parts of the ground alice soon came to the conclusion that it"
