   "and yesterday things went on just as usual i wonder if i ’ ve been changed in the night let me think was i the same when i got up this morning i almost think i can remember feeling a little different but if i ’ m not the same the next question is who in the world am i ah that ’ s the great puzzle ” and she began thinking over all the children she knew that were of the same age as herself to see if she could have been changed for any of them “ i ’ m sure i ’ m not ada ” she said “ for her hair goes in such long ringlets and mine doesn ’ t go in ringlets at all and i ’ m sure i can ’ t be mabel for i know all sorts of things and she oh she knows such a very little besides she ’ s she and i ’ m i andoh dear how puzzling it all is i ’ ll try if i know all the things i used to know let me see four times five is twelve and four times six is thirteen and four times seven isoh dear i shall never get to twenty at that rate however the multiplication table doesn ’ t signify let ’ s try geography london is the capital of paris and paris is the capital of rome and romeno that ’ s all wrong i ’ m certain i must have been changed for mabel i ’ ll try and say ‘ how doth the little ’ ” and she crossed her hands on her lap as if she were saying lessons and began to repeat it but her voice sounded hoarse and strange and the words did not come the same as they used to do “ how doth the little crocodile improve his shining tail and pour the waters of the nile on every golden scale “ how cheerfully he seems to grin how neatly spread his claws and welcome little fishes in with gently smiling jaws ” “ i ’ m sure those are not the right words ” said poor alice and her eyes filled with tears again as she went on “ i must be mabel after all and i shall have to go and live in that poky little house and have next to no toys to play with and oh ever so many lessons to learn no i ’ ve made up my mind about it if i ’ m mabel i ’ ll stay down here it ’ ll be no use their putting their heads down and saying ‘ come up again dear ’ i shall only look up and say ‘ who am i then tell me that first and then if i like being that person i ’ ll come up if not i ’ ll stay down here till i ’ m somebody else ’ but oh dear ” cried alice with a sudden burst of tears “ i do wish they would put their heads down i am so very tired of being all alone"

   "the poor little thing was snorting like a steamengine when she caught it and kept doubling itself up and straightening itself out again so that altogether for the first minute or two it was as much as she could do to hold it as soon as she had made out the proper way of nursing it ( which was to twist it up into a sort of knot and then keep tight hold of its right ear and left foot so as to prevent its undoing itself ) she carried it out into the open air “ if i don ’ t take this child away with me ” thought alice “ they ’ re sure to kill it in a day or two wouldn ’ t it be murder to leave it behind ” she said the last words out loud and the little thing grunted in reply ( it had left off sneezing by this time ) “ don ’ t grunt ” said alice “ that ’ s not at all a proper way of expressing yourself ” the baby grunted again and alice looked very anxiously into its face to see what was the matter with it there could be no doubt that it had a very turnup nose much more like a snout than a real nose also its eyes were getting extremely small for a baby altogether alice did not like the look of the thing at all “ but perhaps it was only sobbing ” she thought and looked into its eyes again to see if there were any tears no there were no tears “ if you ’ re going to turn into a pig my dear ” said alice seriously “ i ’ ll have nothing more to do with you mind now ” the poor little thing sobbed again ( or grunted it was impossible to say which ) and they went on for some while in silence alice was just beginning to think to herself “ now what am i to do with this creature when i get it home ” when it grunted again so violently that she looked down into its face in some alarm this time there could be no mistake about it it was neither more nor less than a pig and she felt that it would be quite absurd for her to carry it further"

   "the first thing she heard was a general chorus of “ there goes bill ” then the rabbit ’ s voice along “ catch him you by the hedge ” then silence and then another confusion of voices “ hold up his headbrandy nowdon ’ t choke himhow was it old fellow what happened to you tell us all about it ” last came a little feeble squeaking voice ( “ that ’ s bill ” thought alice ) “ well i hardly knowno more thank ye i ’ m better nowbut i ’ m a deal too flustered to tell youall i know is something comes at me like a jackinthebox and up i goes like a skyrocket ” “ so you did old fellow ” said the others “ we must burn the house down ” said the rabbit ’ s voice and alice called out as loud as she could “ if you do i ’ ll set dinah at you ” there was a dead silence instantly and alice thought to herself “ i wonder what they will do next if they had any sense they ’ d take the roof off ” after a minute or two they began moving about again and alice heard the rabbit say “ a barrowful will do to begin with ” “ a barrowful of what ” thought alice but she had not long to doubt for the next moment a shower of little pebbles came rattling in at the window and some of them hit her in the face “ i ’ ll put a stop to this ” she said to herself and shouted out “ you ’ d better not do that again ” which produced another dead silence alice noticed with some surprise that the pebbles were all turning into little cakes as they lay on the floor and a bright idea came into her head “ if i eat one of these cakes ” she thought “ it ’ s sure to"

   "an enormous puppy was looking down at her with large round eyes and feebly stretching out one paw trying to touch her “ poor little thing ” said alice in a coaxing tone and she tried hard to whistle to it but she was terribly frightened all the time at the thought that it might be hungry in which case it would be very likely to eat her up in spite of all her coaxing hardly knowing what she did she picked up a little bit of stick and held it out to the puppy whereupon the puppy jumped into the air off all its feet at once with a yelp of delight and rushed at the stick and made believe to worry it then alice dodged behind a great thistle to keep herself from being run over and the moment she appeared on the other side the puppy made another rush at the stick and tumbled head over heels in its hurry to get hold of it then alice thinking it was very like having a game of play with a carthorse and expecting every moment to be trampled under its feet ran round the thistle again then the puppy began a series of short charges at the stick running a very little way forwards each time and a long way back and barking hoarsely all the while till at last it sat down a good way off panting with its tongue hanging out of its mouth and its great eyes half shut this seemed to alice a good opportunity for making her escape so she set off at once and ran till she was quite tired and out of breath and till the puppy ’ s bark sounded"
