   "she pitied him deeply “ what is his sorrow ” she asked the gryphon and the gryphon answered very nearly in the same words as before “ it ’ s all his fancy that he hasn ’ t got no sorrow you know come on ” so they went up to the mock turtle who looked at them with large eyes full of tears but said nothing “ this here young lady ” said the gryphon “ she wants for to know your history she do ” “ i ’ ll tell it her ” said the mock turtle in a deep hollow tone “ sit down both of you and don ’ t speak a word till i ’ ve finished ” so they sat down and nobody spoke for some minutes alice thought to herself “ i don ’ t see how he can ever finish if he doesn ’ t begin ” but she waited patiently “ once ” said the mock turtle at last with a deep sigh “ i was a real turtle ” these words were followed by a very long silence broken only by an occasional exclamation of “ hjckrrh ” from the gryphon and the constant heavy sobbing of the mock turtle alice was very nearly getting up and saying “ thank you sir for your interesting story ” but she could not help thinking there must be more to come so she sat still and said nothing “ when we were little ” the mock turtle went on at last more calmly though still sobbing a little now and then “ we went to school in the sea the master was an old turtlewe used to call him tortoise ” “ why did you call him tortoise if he wasn ’ t one ” alice asked “ we called him tortoise because he taught us ” said the mock turtle angrily “ really you are very dull ” “ you ought to be ashamed of yourself for asking such a simple question ” added the gryphon and then they both sat silent and looked at poor alice who felt ready to sink into the earth at last the gryphon said to the mock turtle “ drive on old fellow don ’ t be all day about it ” and he went on in these words “ yes we went to school in the sea though you mayn ’ t believe it ” “ i never said i didn ’ t ” interrupted alice “ you did ” said the mock turtle “ hold your tongue ” added the gryphon before alice could speak again the mock turtle went on “ we had the best of educationsin fact we went to school every day ” “ i ’ ve been to a dayschool too ” said alice “ you needn ’ t be so proud as all that ” “ with extras ” asked the mock turtle a little anxiously “ yes ” said alice “ we learned french and music ” “ and washing ” said the mock turtle “ certainly not ” said alice indignantly “ ah then yours wasn ’ t a really good school ” said the mock turtle in a tone of great relief “ now at ours they had at the end of the bill ‘ french music and washingextra ’ ” “ you couldn ’ t have wanted it much ” said alice “ living at the bottom of the sea ” “ i couldn ’ t afford to learn it ” said the mock turtle with a sigh “ i only took the regular course ” “ what was that ” inquired alice “ reeling and writhing of course to begin with ” the mock turtle replied “ and then the different branches of arithmeticambition distraction uglification and derision ” “ i never heard of ‘ uglification ’ ” alice ventured to say “ what is it ” the gryphon lifted up both its paws in surprise “ what never heard of uglifying ” it exclaimed “ you know what to beautify is i suppose ” “ yes ” said alice doubtfully “ it meanstomakeanythingprettier ” “ well then ” the gryphon went on “ if you don ’ t know what to uglify is you are a simpleton ” alice did not feel encouraged to ask any more questions about it so she turned to the mock turtle and said “ what else had you to learn ” “ well there was mystery ” the mock turtle replied counting off the subjects on his flappers “ mystery ancient and modern with seaography then drawlingthe drawlingmaster was an old congereel that used to come once a week he taught us drawling stretching and fainting in coils ” “ what was that like ” said alice “ well i can ’ t show it you myself ” the mock turtle said “ i ’ m too stiff and the gryphon never learnt it ” “ hadn ’ t time ” said the gryphon “ i went to the classics master though he was an old crab he was ” “ i never went to him ” the mock turtle said with"

   "“ what can all that green stuff be ” said alice “ and where have my shoulders got to and oh my poor hands how is it i can ’ t see you ” she was moving them about as she spoke but no result seemed to follow except a little shaking among the distant green leaves as there seemed to be no chance of getting her hands up to her head she tried to get her head down to them and was delighted to find that her neck would bend about easily in any direction like a serpent she had just succeeded in curving it down into a graceful zigzag and was going to dive in among the leaves which she found to be nothing but the tops of the trees under which she had been wandering when a sharp hiss made her draw back in a hurry a large pigeon had flown into her face and was beating her violently with its wings “ serpent ” screamed the pigeon “ i ’ m not a serpent ” said alice indignantly “ let me alone ” “ serpent i say again ” repeated the pigeon but in a more subdued tone and added with a kind of sob “ i ’ ve tried every way and nothing seems to suit them ” “ i haven ’ t the least idea what you ’ re talking about ” said alice “ i ’ ve tried the roots of trees and i ’ ve tried banks and i ’ ve tried hedges ” the pigeon went on without attending to her “ but those serpents there ’ s no pleasing them ” alice was more and more puzzled but she thought there was no use in saying anything more till the pigeon had finished “ as if it wasn ’ t trouble enough hatching the eggs ” said the pigeon “ but i must be on the lookout for serpents night and day why i haven ’ t had a wink of sleep these three weeks ” “ i ’ m very sorry you ’ ve been annoyed ” said alice who was beginning to see its meaning “ and just as i ’ d taken the highest tree in the wood ” continued the pigeon raising its voice to a shriek “ and just as i was thinking i should be free of them at last they must needs come wriggling down from the sky ugh serpent ” “ but i ’ m not a serpent i tell you ” said alice “ i ’ m ai ’ m a ” “ well what are you ” said the pigeon “ i can see you ’ re trying to invent something ” “ ii ’ m a little girl ” said alice rather doubtfully as she remembered the number of changes she had gone through that day “ a likely story indeed ” said the pigeon in a tone of the deepest contempt “ i ’ ve seen a good many little girls in my time but never one with such a neck as that no no you ’ re a serpent and there ’ s no use denying it i suppose you ’ ll be telling me next that you never tasted an egg ” “ i have tasted eggs certainly ” said alice who was a very truthful child “ but little girls eat eggs quite as much as serpents do you know ” “ i don ’ t believe it ” said the pigeon “ but if they do why then they ’ re a kind of serpent that ’ s all i"

   "the hatter ’ s remark seemed to have no sort of meaning in it and yet it was certainly english “ i don ’ t quite understand you ” she said as politely as she could “ the dormouse is asleep again ” said the hatter and he poured a little hot tea upon its nose the dormouse shook its head impatiently and said without opening its eyes “ of course of course just what i was going to remark myself ” “ have you guessed the riddle yet ” the hatter said turning to alice again “ no i give it up ” alice replied “ what ’ s the answer ” “ i haven ’ t the slightest idea ” said the hatter “ nor i ” said the march hare alice sighed wearily “ i think you might do something better with the time ” she said “ than waste it in asking riddles that have no answers ” “ if you knew time as well as i do ” said the hatter “ you wouldn ’ t talk about wasting it it ’ s him ” “ i don ’ t know what you mean ” said alice “ of course you don ’ t ” the hatter said tossing his head contemptuously “ i dare say you never even spoke to time ” “ perhaps not ” alice cautiously replied “ but i know i have to beat time when i learn music ” “ ah that accounts for it ” said the hatter “ he won ’ t stand beating now if you only kept on good terms with him he ’ d do almost anything you liked with the clock for instance suppose it were nine o ’ clock in the morning just time to begin lessons you ’ d only have to whisper a hint to time and round goes the clock in a twinkling halfpast one time for dinner ” ( “ i only wish it was ” the march hare said to itself in a whisper ) “ that would be grand certainly ” said alice thoughtfully “ but theni shouldn ’ t be hungry for it you know ” “ not at first perhaps ” said the hatter “ but you could keep it to halfpast one as long as you liked ” “ is that the way you manage ” alice asked the hatter shook his head mournfully “ not i ” he replied “ we quarrelled last marchjust before he went mad you know ” ( pointing with his tea spoon at the march hare ) “ it was at the great concert given by the queen of hearts and i had to sing ‘ twinkle twinkle little bat how i wonder what you ’ re at ’ you know the song perhaps ” “ i ’ ve heard something like it ” said alice “ it goes on you know ” the hatter continued “ in this way ‘ up above the world you fly like a teatray in the sky twinkle twinkle ’ ” here the dormouse shook itself and began singing in its sleep “ twinkle twinkle twinkle twinkle ” and went on so long that they had to pinch it to make it stop “ well i ’ d hardly finished the first verse ” said the hatter “ when"

   "how brave they ’ ll all think me at home why i wouldn ’ t say anything about it even if i fell off the top of the house ” ( which was very likely true ) down down down would the fall never come to an end “ i wonder how many miles i ’ ve fallen by this time ” she said aloud “ i must be getting somewhere near the centre of the earth let me see that would be four thousand miles down i think ” ( for you see alice had learnt several things of this sort in her lessons in the schoolroom and though this was not a very good opportunity for showing off her knowledge as there was no one to listen to her still it was good practice to say it over ) “ yes that ’ s about the right distancebut then i wonder what latitude or longitude i ’ ve got to ” ( alice had no idea what latitude was or longitude either but thought they were nice grand words to say ) presently she began again “ i wonder if i shall fall right through the earth how funny it ’ ll seem to come out among the people that walk with their heads downward the antipathies i think ” ( she was rather glad there was no one listening this time as it didn ’ t sound at all the right word ) “ but i shall have to ask them what the name of the country is you know please ma ’ am is this new zealand or australia ” ( and she tried to curtsey as she spokefancy curtseying as you ’ re falling through the air do you think you could manage it ) “ and what an ignorant little girl she ’ ll think me for asking no it ’ ll never do to ask perhaps i shall see it written up somewhere ” down down down there was nothing else to do so alice soon began talking again “ dinah ’ ll miss me very much tonight i should think ” ( dinah was the cat ) “ i hope they ’ ll remember her saucer of milk at teatime dinah my dear i wish you were down here with me there are no mice in the air i ’ m afraid but you might catch a bat and that ’ s very like a mouse you know but do cats eat bats i wonder ” and here alice began to get rather sleepy and went on saying to herself in a dreamy sort of way “ do cats eat bats do cats eat bats ” and sometimes “ do bats eat cats ” for you see as she couldn ’ t answer either question it didn ’ t much matter which way she put it she felt that she was"

   "“ come back ” the caterpillar called after her “ i ’ ve something important to say ” this sounded promising certainly alice turned and came back again “ keep your temper ” said the caterpillar “ is that all ” said alice swallowing down her anger as well as she could “ no ” said the caterpillar alice thought she might as well wait as she had nothing else to do and perhaps after all it might tell her something worth hearing for some minutes it puffed away without speaking but at last it unfolded its arms took the hookah out of its mouth again and said “ so you think you ’ re changed do you ” “ i ’ m afraid i am sir ” said alice “ i can ’ t remember things as i usedand i don ’ t keep the same size for ten minutes together ” “ can ’ t remember what things ” said the caterpillar “ well i ’ ve tried to say “ how doth the little busy bee ” but it all came different ” alice replied in a very melancholy voice “ repeat “ you are old father william ’ ” said the caterpillar alice folded her hands and began “ you are old father william ” the young man said “ and your hair has become very white and yet you incessantly stand on your head do you think at your age it is right ” “ in my youth ” father william replied to his son “ i feared it might injure the brain but now that i ’ m perfectly sure i have none why i do it again and again ” “ you are old ” said the youth “ as i mentioned before and have grown most uncommonly fat yet you turned a backsomersault in at the door pray what is the reason of that ” “ in my youth ” said the sage as he shook his grey locks “ i kept all my limbs very supple by the use of this ointmentone shilling the box allow me to sell you a couple ” “ you are old ” said the youth “ and your jaws are too weak for anything tougher than suet yet you finished the goose with the bones and the beak pray how did you manage to do it ” “ in my youth ” said his father “ i took to the law and argued each case with my wife and the muscular strength which it gave to my jaw has lasted the rest of my life ” “ you are old ” said the youth “ one would hardly suppose that your eye was as steady as ever yet you balanced an eel on the end of your nose what made you so awfully clever ” “ i have answered three questions"

   "she had already heard her sentence three of the players to be executed for having missed their turns and she did not like the look of things at all as the game was in such confusion that she never knew whether it was her turn or not so she went in search of her hedgehog the hedgehog was engaged in a fight with another hedgehog which seemed to alice an excellent opportunity for croqueting one of them with the other the only difficulty was that her flamingo was gone across to the other side of the garden where alice could see it trying in a helpless sort of way to fly up into a tree by the time she had caught the flamingo and brought it back the fight was over and both the hedgehogs were out of sight “ but it doesn ’ t matter much ” thought alice “ as all the arches are gone from this side of the ground ” so she tucked it away under her arm that it might not escape again and went back for a little more conversation with her friend when she got back to the cheshire cat she was surprised to find quite a large crowd collected round it there was a dispute going on between the executioner the king and the queen who were all talking at once while all the rest were quite silent and looked very uncomfortable the moment alice appeared she was appealed to by all three to settle the question and they repeated their arguments to her though as they all spoke at once she found it very hard indeed to make out exactly what they said the executioner ’ s argument was that you couldn ’ t cut off a head unless there was a body to cut it off from that he had never had to do such a thing before and he wasn ’ t going to begin at his time of life the king ’ s argument was that anything that had a head could be beheaded and that you weren ’ t to talk nonsense the queen ’ s argument was that if something wasn ’ t done about it in less than no time she ’ d have everybody executed all round ( it was this last remark that had made the whole party look so grave and anxious ) alice could think of nothing else to say but “ it belongs to the duchess you ’ d better ask her about it ” “ she ’ s in prison ” the queen said to the executioner “ fetch her here ” and the executioner went off like an arrow the cat ’ s head began fading away the moment he was gone and by the time he had"
