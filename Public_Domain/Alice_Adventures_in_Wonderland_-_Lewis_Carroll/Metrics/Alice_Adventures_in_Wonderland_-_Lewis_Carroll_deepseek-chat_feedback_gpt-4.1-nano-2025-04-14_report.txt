   "she had already heard her sentence three of the players to be executed for having missed their turns and she did not like the look of things at all as the game was in such confusion that she never knew whether it was her turn or not so she went in search of her hedgehog the hedgehog was engaged in a fight with another hedgehog which seemed to alice an excellent opportunity for croqueting one of them with the other the only difficulty was that her flamingo was gone across to the other side of the garden where alice could see it trying in a helpless sort of way to fly up into a tree by the time she had caught the flamingo and brought it back the fight was over and both the hedgehogs were out of sight “ but it doesn ’ t matter much ” thought alice “ as all the arches are gone from this side of the ground ” so she tucked it away under her arm that it might not escape again and went back for a little more conversation with her friend when she got back to the cheshire cat she was surprised to find quite a large crowd collected round it there was a dispute going on between the executioner the king and the queen who were all talking at once while all the rest were quite silent and looked very uncomfortable the moment alice appeared she was appealed to by all three to settle the question and they repeated their arguments to her though as they all spoke at once she found it very hard indeed to make out exactly what they said the executioner ’ s argument was that you couldn ’ t cut off a head unless there was a body to cut it off from that he had never had to do such a thing before and he wasn ’ t going to begin at his time of life the king ’ s argument was that anything that had a head could be beheaded and that you weren ’ t to talk nonsense the queen ’ s argument was that if something wasn ’ t done about it in less than no time she ’ d have everybody executed all round ( it was this last remark that had made the whole party look so grave and anxious ) alice could think of nothing else to say but “ it belongs to the duchess"

   "the poor little thing was snorting like a steamengine when she caught it and kept doubling itself up and straightening itself out again so that altogether for the first minute or two it was as much as she could do to hold it as soon as she had made out the proper way of nursing it ( which was to twist it up into a sort of knot and then keep tight hold of its right ear and left foot so as to prevent its undoing itself ) she carried it out into the open air “ if i don ’ t take this child away with me ” thought alice “ they ’ re sure to kill it in a day or two wouldn ’ t it be murder to leave it behind ” she said the last words out loud and the little thing grunted in reply ( it had left off sneezing by this time ) “ don ’ t grunt ” said alice “ that ’ s not at all a proper way of expressing yourself ” the baby grunted again and alice looked very anxiously into its face to see what was the matter with it there could be no doubt that it had a very turnup nose much more like a snout than a real nose also its eyes were getting extremely small for a baby altogether alice did not like the look of the thing at all “ but perhaps it was only sobbing ” she thought and looked into its eyes again to see if there were any tears no there were no tears “ if you ’ re going to turn into a pig my dear ” said alice seriously “ i ’ ll have nothing more to do with you mind now ” the poor little thing sobbed again ( or grunted it was impossible to say which ) and they went on for some while in silence alice was just beginning to think to herself “ now what am i to do with this creature when i get it home ” when it grunted again so violently that she looked down into its face in some alarm this time there could be no mistake about it it was neither more nor less than a pig and she felt that it would be quite absurd for her to carry it further"

   "“ what size do you want to be ” it asked “ oh i ’ m not particular as to size ” alice hastily replied “ only one doesn ’ t like changing so often you know ” “ i don ’ t know ” said the caterpillar alice said nothing she had never been so much contradicted in her life before and she felt that she was losing her temper “ are you content now ” said the caterpillar “ well i should like to be a little larger sir if you wouldn ’ t mind ” said alice “ three inches is such a wretched height to be ” “ it is a very good height indeed ” said the caterpillar angrily rearing itself upright as it spoke ( it was exactly three inches high ) “ but i ’ m not used to it ” pleaded poor alice in a piteous tone and she thought of herself “ i wish the creatures wouldn ’ t be so easily offended ” “ you ’ ll get used to it in time ” said the caterpillar and it put the hookah into its mouth and began smoking again this time alice waited patiently until it chose to speak again in a minute or two the caterpillar took the hookah out of its mouth and yawned once or twice and shook itself then it got down off the mushroom and crawled away in the grass merely remarking as it went “ one side will make you grow taller and the other side will make you grow shorter ” “ one side of what the other side of what ” thought alice to herself “ of the mushroom ” said the caterpillar just as if she had asked it aloud and in another moment it was out"

   "“ nonsense ” said alice very loudly and decidedly and the queen was silent the king laid his hand upon her arm and timidly said “ consider my dear she is only a child ” the queen turned angrily away from him and said to the knave “ turn them over ” the knave did so very carefully with one foot “ get up ” said the queen in a shrill loud voice and the three gardeners instantly jumped up and began bowing to the king the queen the royal children and everybody else “ leave off that ” screamed the queen “ you make me giddy ” and then turning to the rosetree she went on “ what have you been doing here ” “ may it please your majesty ” said two in a very humble tone going down on one knee as he spoke “ we were trying ” “ i see ” said the queen who had meanwhile been examining the roses “ off with their heads ” and the procession moved on three of the soldiers remaining behind to execute the unfortunate gardeners who ran to alice for protection “ you shan ’ t be beheaded ” said alice and she put them into a large flowerpot that stood near the three soldiers wandered about for a minute or two looking for them and then quietly marched off after the others “ are their heads off ” shouted the queen “ their heads are gone if it please your majesty ” the soldiers shouted in reply “ that ’ s right ” shouted the queen “ can you play croquet ” the soldiers were silent and looked at alice as the question was evidently meant for her “ yes ” shouted alice"
