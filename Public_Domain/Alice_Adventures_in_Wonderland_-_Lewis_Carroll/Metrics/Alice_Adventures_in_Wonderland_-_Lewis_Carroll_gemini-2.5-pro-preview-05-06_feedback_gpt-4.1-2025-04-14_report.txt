   "and yesterday things went on just as usual i wonder if i ’ ve been changed in the night let me think was i the same when i got up this morning i almost think i can remember feeling a little different but if i ’ m not the same the next question is who in the world am i ah that ’ s the great puzzle ” and she began thinking over all the children she knew that were of the same age as herself to see if she could have been changed for any of them “ i ’ m sure i ’ m not ada ” she said “ for her hair goes in such long ringlets and mine doesn ’ t go in ringlets at all and i ’ m sure i can ’ t be mabel for i know all sorts of things and she oh she knows such a very little besides she ’ s she and i ’ m i andoh dear how puzzling it all is i ’ ll try if i know all the things i used to know let me see four times five is twelve and four times six is thirteen and four times seven isoh dear i shall never get to twenty at that rate however the multiplication table doesn ’ t signify let ’ s try geography london is the capital of paris and paris is the capital of rome and romeno that ’ s all wrong i ’ m certain i must have been changed for mabel i ’ ll try and say ‘ how doth the little ’ ” and she crossed her hands on her lap as if she were saying lessons and began to repeat it but her voice sounded hoarse and strange and the words did not come the same as they used to do “ how doth the little crocodile improve his shining tail and pour the waters of the nile on every golden scale “ how cheerfully he seems to grin how neatly spread his claws and welcome little fishes in with gently smiling jaws ” “ i ’ m sure those are not the right words ” said poor alice and her eyes filled with tears again as she went on “ i must be mabel after all and i shall have to go and live in that poky little house and have next to no toys to play with and oh ever so many lessons to learn no i ’ ve made up my mind about it if i ’ m mabel i ’ ll stay down here it ’ ll be no use their putting their heads down and saying ‘ come up again dear ’ i shall only look up and say ‘ who am i then tell me that first and then if i like being that person i ’ ll come up if not i ’ ll stay down here till i ’ m somebody else ’ but oh dear ” cried alice with a sudden burst of tears “ i do wish they would put their heads down i am so very tired of being all"

   "come to an end “ i wonder how many miles i ’ ve fallen by this time ” she said aloud “ i must be getting somewhere near the centre of the earth let me see that would be four thousand miles down i think ” ( for you see alice had learnt several things of this sort in her lessons in the schoolroom and though this was not a very good opportunity for showing off her knowledge as there was no one to listen to her still it was good practice to say it over ) “ yes that ’ s about the right distancebut then i wonder what latitude or longitude i ’ ve got to ” ( alice had no idea what latitude was or longitude either but thought they were nice grand words to say ) presently she began again “ i wonder if i shall fall right through the earth how funny it ’ ll seem to come out among the people that walk with their heads downward the antipathies i think ” ( she was rather glad there was no one listening this time as it didn ’ t sound at all the right word ) “ but i shall have to ask them what the name of the country is you know please ma ’ am is this new zealand or australia ” ( and she tried to curtsey as she spokefancy curtseying as you ’ re falling through the air do you think you could manage it ) “ and what an ignorant little girl she ’ ll think me for asking no it ’ ll never do to ask perhaps i shall see it written up somewhere ” down down down there was nothing else to do so alice soon began talking again “ dinah ’ ll miss me very much tonight i should think ” ( dinah was the cat ) “ i hope they ’ ll remember her saucer of milk at teatime dinah my dear i wish you were down here with me there are no mice in the air i ’ m afraid but you might catch a bat and that ’ s very like a mouse you know but do cats eat bats i wonder ” and here alice began to get rather sleepy and went on saying to herself in a dreamy sort of way “ do cats eat bats do cats eat bats ” and sometimes “ do bats eat cats ” for you see as she couldn ’ t answer either question it didn ’ t much matter which way she put it she felt that she was dozing off and had just begun to dream that she was walking hand in hand with dinah and saying to her very earnestly “ now dinah tell me the truth did you ever eat a bat ” when suddenly thump thump down she came upon a heap of sticks and dry leaves and the fall was"

   "“ it ’ s a cheshire cat ” said the duchess “ and that ’ s why pig ” she said the last word with such sudden violence that alice quite jumped but she saw in another moment that it was addressed to the baby and not to her so she took courage and went on again “ i didn ’ t know that cheshire cats always grinned in fact i didn ’ t know that cats could grin ” “ they all can ” said the duchess “ and most of ’ em do ” “ i don ’ t know of any that do ” alice said very politely feeling quite pleased to have got into a conversation “ you don ’ t know much ” said the duchess “ and that ’ s a fact ” alice did not at all like the tone of this remark and thought it would be as well to introduce some other subject of conversation while she was trying to fix on one the cook took the cauldron of soup off the fire and at once set to work throwing everything within her reach at the duchess and the babythe fireirons came first then followed a shower of saucepans plates and dishes the duchess took no notice of them even when they hit her and the baby was howling so much already that it was quite impossible to say whether the blows hurt it or not “ oh please mind what you ’ re doing ” cried alice jumping up and down in an agony of terror “ oh there goes his precious nose ” as an unusually large saucepan flew close by it and very nearly carried it off “ if everybody minded their own business ” the duchess said in a hoarse growl “ the world would go round a deal faster than it does ” “ which would not be an advantage ” said alice who felt very glad to get an opportunity of showing off a little of her knowledge “ just think of what work it would make with the day and night you see the earth takes twentyfour hours to turn round on its axis ” “ talking of axes ” said the duchess “ chop off her head ”"

   "as she said this she came upon a neat little house on the door of which was a bright brass plate with the name “ w rabbit ” engraved upon it she went in without knocking and hurried upstairs in great fear lest she should meet the real mary ann and be turned out of the house before she had found the fan and gloves “ how queer it seems ” alice said to herself “ to be going messages for a rabbit i suppose dinah ’ ll be sending me on messages next ” and she began fancying the sort of thing that would happen “ ‘ miss alice come here directly and get ready for your walk ’ ‘ coming in a minute nurse but i ’ ve got to see that the mouse doesn ’ t get out ’ only i don ’ t think ” alice went on “ that they ’ d let dinah stop in the house if it began ordering people about like that ” by this time she had found her way into a tidy little room with a table in the window and on it ( as she had hoped ) a fan and two or three pairs of tiny white kid gloves she took up the fan and a pair of the gloves and was just going to leave the room when her eye fell upon a little bottle that stood near the lookingglass there was no label this time with the words “ drink me ” but nevertheless she uncorked it and put it to her lips “ i know something interesting is sure to happen ” she said to herself “ whenever i eat or drink anything so i ’ ll just see what this bottle does i do hope it ’ ll make me grow large again for really i ’ m quite tired of being such a tiny little thing ”"
