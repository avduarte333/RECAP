   "i approached it it was a road or a track it led straight up to the light which now beamed from a sort of knoll amidst a clump of treesfirs apparently from what i could distinguish of the character of their forms and foliage through the gloom my star vanished as i drew near some obstacle had intervened between me and it i put out my hand to feel the dark mass before me i discriminated the rough stones of a low wallabove it something like palisades and within a high and prickly hedge i groped on again a whitish object gleamed before me it was a gatea wicket it moved on its hinges as i touched it on each side stood a sable bushholly or yew entering the gate and passing the shrubs the silhouette of a house rose to view black low and rather long but the guiding light shone nowhere all was obscurity were the inmates retired to rest i feared it must be so in seeking the door i turned an angle there shot out the friendly gleam again from the lozenged panes of a very small latticed window within a foot of the ground made still smaller by the growth of ivy or some other creeping plant whose leaves clustered thick over the portion of the house wall in which it was set the aperture was so screened and narrow that curtain or shutter had been deemed unnecessary and when i stooped down and put aside the spray of foliage shooting over it i could see all within i could see clearly a room with a sanded floor clean scoured a dresser of walnut with pewter plates ranged in rows reflecting the redness and radiance of a glowing peatfire i could see a clock a white deal table some chairs the candle whose ray had been my beacon burnt on the table and by its light an elderly woman somewhat roughlooking but scrupulously clean like all about her was knitting a stocking i noticed these objects cursorily onlyin them there was nothing extraordinary a group of more interest appeared near the hearth sitting still amidst the rosy peace and warmth suffusing it two young graceful womenladies in every pointsat one in a low rockingchair the other on a lower stool both wore deep mourning of crape and bombazeen which sombre garb singularly set off very fair necks and faces a large old pointer dog rested its massive head on the knee of one girlin the lap of the other was cushioned a black cat a strange place was this humble kitchen for such occupants who were they they could not be the daughters of the elderly person at the table for she looked like a rustic and they were all delicacy and cultivation i had nowhere seen such faces as theirs and yet as i gazed on them i seemed intimate with every lineament i can not call them handsomethey were too pale and grave for the word as they each bent over a book they looked thoughtful almost to severity a stand between them supported a second candle and two great volumes to which they frequently referred comparing them seemingly with the smaller books they held in their hands like people consulting a dictionary to aid them in the task of translation this scene was as silent as if all the figures had been shadows and the firelit apartment a picture so hushed was it i could hear the cinders fall from the grate the clock tick in its obscure corner and i even fancied i could distinguish the clickclick of the woman ’ s knittingneedles when therefore a voice broke the strange stillness at last it was audible enough to me “ listen diana ” said one of the absorbed students “ franz and old daniel are together in the nighttime and franz is telling a dream from which he has awakened in terrorlisten ” and in a low voice she read something of which not one word was intelligible to me for it was in an unknown tongueneither french nor latin whether it were greek or german i could not tell “ that is strong ” she said when she had finished “ i relish it ” the other girl who had lifted her head to listen to her sister repeated while she gazed at the fire a line of what had been read at a later day i knew the language and the book therefore i will here quote the line though when i first heard it it was only like a stroke on sounding brass to meconveying no meaning “ ‘ da trat hervor einer anzusehen wie die sternen nacht ’ good good ” she exclaimed while her dark and deep eye sparkled “ there you have a dim and mighty archangel fitly set before you the line is worth a hundred pages of fustian ‘ ich wäge die gedanken in der schale meines zornes und die werke mit dem gewichte meines grimms ’ i like it ” both were again silent “ is there ony country where they talk i ’ that way ” asked the old woman looking up from her knitting “ yes hannaha far larger country than england where they talk in no other way ” “ well for sure case i knawn ’ t how they can understand t ’ one t ’ other and if either o ’ ye went there ye could tell what they said i guess ” “ we could probably tell something of what they said but not allfor we are not as clever as you think us hannah we don ’ t speak german and we can not read it without a dictionary to help us ” “ and what good does it do you ” “ we mean to teach it some timeor at least the elements as they say and then we shall get more money than we do now ” “ varry like but give ower studying ye ’ ve done enough for tonight ” “ i think we have at least i ’ m tired mary are you ” “ mortally after all it ’ s tough work fagging away at a language with no master but a lexicon ” “ it is especially such a language as this crabbed but glorious deutsch i wonder when st john will come home ” “ surely he will not be long now it is just ten ( looking at a little gold watch she drew from her girdle ) it rains fast hannah will you have the goodness to look at the fire in the parlour ” the woman rose she opened a door through which i dimly saw a passage soon i heard her stir a fire in an inner room she presently came back “ ah childer ” said she “ it fair troubles me to go into yond ’ room now it looks so lonesome wi ’ the chair empty and set back in a corner ” she wiped her eyes with her apron the two girls grave before looked sad now “ but he is in a better place ” continued hannah “ we shouldn ’ t wish him here again and then nobody need to have a quieter death nor he had ” “ you say he never mentioned us ” inquired one of the"

   "“ the carrier no doubt ” i thought and ran downstairs without inquiry i was passing the backparlour or teachers ’ sittingroom the door of which was half open to go to the kitchen when some one ran out “ it ’ s her i am surei could have told her anywhere ” cried the individual who stopped my progress and took my hand i looked i saw a woman attired like a welldressed servant matronly yet still young very goodlooking with black hair and eyes and lively complexion “ well who is it ” she asked in a voice and with a smile i half recognised “ you ’ ve not quite forgotten me i think miss jane ” in another second i was embracing and kissing her rapturously “ bessie bessie bessie ” that was all i said whereat she half laughed half cried and we both went into the parlour by the fire stood a little fellow of three years old in plaid frock and trousers “ that is my little boy ” said bessie directly “ then you are married bessie ” “ yes nearly five years since to robert leaven the coachman and i ’ ve a little girl besides bobby there that i ’ ve christened jane ” “ and you don ’ t live at gateshead ” “ i live at the lodge the old porter has left ” “ well and how do they all get on tell me everything about them bessie but sit down first and bobby come and sit on my knee will you ” but bobby preferred sidling over to his mother “ you ’ re not grown so very tall miss jane nor so very stout ” continued mrs leaven “ i dare say they ’ ve not kept you too well at school miss reed is the head and shoulders taller than you are and miss georgiana would make two of you in breadth ” “ georgiana is handsome i suppose bessie ” “ very she went up to london last winter with her mama and there everybody admired her and a young lord fell in love with her but his relations were against the match andwhat do you thinkhe and miss georgiana made it up to run away but they were found out and stopped it was miss reed that found them out i believe she was envious and now she and her sister lead a cat and dog life together they are always quarrelling ” “ well and what of john reed ” “ oh he is not doing so well as his mama could wish he went to college and he gotplucked i think they call it and then his uncles wanted him to be a barrister and study the law but he is such a dissipated young man they will never make much of him i think ” “ what does he look like ” “ he is very tall some people call him a finelooking young man but he has such thick lips ” “ and mrs reed ” “ missis looks stout and well enough in the face but i think she ’ s not quite easy in her mind mr john ’ s conduct does not please herhe spends a deal of money ” “ did she send you here bessie ” “ no indeed but i have long wanted to see you and when i heard that there had been a letter from you and that you were going to another part of the country i thought i ’ d just set off and get a look at you before you were quite out of my reach ” “ i am afraid you are disappointed in me bessie ” i said this laughing i perceived that bessie ’ s glance though it expressed regard did in no shape denote admiration “ no miss jane not exactly you are genteel enough you look like a lady and it is as much as ever i expected of you you were no beauty as a child ” i smiled at bessie ’ s frank answer i felt that it was correct but i confess i was not quite indifferent to its import at eighteen most people wish to please and the conviction that they have not an exterior likely to second that desire brings anything but gratification “ i dare say you are clever though ” continued bessie by way of solace “ what can you do can you play on the piano ” “ a little ” there was one in the room bessie went and opened it and then asked me to sit down and give her a tune i played a waltz or two and she was charmed “ the miss reeds could not play as well ” said she exultingly “ i always said you would surpass them in learning and can you draw ” “ that is one of my paintings over the chimneypiece ” it was a landscape in water colours of which i had made a present to the superintendent in acknowledgment of her obliging mediation with the committee on my behalf and which she had framed and glazed “ well that is beautiful miss jane it is as fine a picture as any miss reed ’ s drawingmaster could paint let alone the young ladies themselves who could not come near it and have you learnt french ” “ yes bessie i can both read it and speak it ” “ and you can work on muslin and canvas ” “ i can ” “ oh you are quite a lady miss jane i knew you would be you will get on whether your relations notice you or not there was something i wanted to ask you have you ever heard anything from your father ’ s kinsfolk the eyres ” “ never in my life ” “ well you know missis always said they were poor and quite despicable and they may be poor but i believe they are as much gentry as the reeds are for one day nearly seven years ago a mr eyre came to gateshead and wanted to see you missis said you were at school fifty miles off he seemed so much disappointed for he could not stay he was going on a voyage to a foreign country and the ship was to sail from london in a day or two he looked quite a gentleman and i believe he was your father ’ s brother ” “ what foreign country was he going to bessie ” “ an island thousands of miles off where they make winethe butler did tell me ” “ madeira ” i suggested “ yes that is itthat is the very word ” “ so he went ” “ yes he did not stay many minutes in the house missis was very high with him she called him afterwards a ‘ sneaking tradesman ’ my

   "take no notice of me but i was determined not to seem at a loss for occupation or amusement i had brought my drawing materials with me and they served me for both provided with a case of pencils and some sheets of paper i used to take a seat apart from them near the window and busy myself in sketching fancy vignettes representing any scene that happened momentarily to shape itself in the evershifting kaleidoscope of imagination a glimpse of sea between two rocks the rising moon and a ship crossing its disk a group of reeds and waterflags and a naiad ’ s head crowned with lotusflowers rising out of them an elf sitting in a hedgesparrow ’ s nest under a wreath of hawthornbloom one morning i fell to sketching a face what sort of a face it was to be i did not care or know i took a soft black pencil gave it a broad point and worked away soon i had traced on the paper a broad and prominent forehead and a square lower outline of visage that contour gave me pleasure my fingers proceeded actively to fill it with features stronglymarked horizontal eyebrows must be traced under that brow then followed naturally a welldefined nose with a straight ridge and full nostrils then a flexiblelooking mouth by no means narrow then a firm chin with a decided cleft down the middle of it of course some black whiskers were wanted and some jetty hair tufted on the temples and waved above the forehead now for the eyes i had left them to the last because they required the most careful working i drew them large i shaped them well the eyelashes i traced long and sombre the irids lustrous and large “ good but not quite the thing ” i thought as i surveyed the effect “ they want more force and spirit ” and i wrought the shades blacker that the lights might flash more brilliantlya happy touch or two secured success there i had a friend ’ s face under my gaze and what did it signify that those young ladies turned their backs on me i looked at it i smiled at the speaking likeness i was absorbed and content “ is that a portrait of some one you know ” asked eliza who had approached me unnoticed i responded that it was merely a fancy head and hurried it beneath the other sheets of course i lied it was in fact a very faithful representation of mr rochester but what was that to her or to any one but myself georgiana also advanced to look the other drawings pleased her much but she called that “ an ugly man ” they both seemed surprised at my skill i offered to sketch their portraits and each in turn sat for a pencil outline then georgiana produced her album i promised to contribute a watercolour drawing this put her at once into good humour she proposed a walk in the grounds before we had been out two hours we were deep in a confidential conversation she had favoured me with a description of the brilliant winter she had spent in london two seasons agoof the admiration she had there excitedthe attention she had received and i even got hints of the titled conquest she had made in the course of the afternoon and evening these hints were enlarged on various soft conversations were reported and sentimental scenes represented and in short a volume of a novel of fashionable life was that day improvised by her for my benefit the communications were renewed from day to day they always ran on the same themeherself her loves and woes it was strange she never once adverted either to her mother ’ s illness or her brother ’ s death or the present gloomy state of the family prospects her mind seemed wholly taken up with reminiscences of past gaiety and aspirations after dissipations to come she passed about five minutes each day in her mother ’ s sickroom and no more eliza still spoke little she had evidently no time to talk i never saw a busier person than she seemed to be yet it was difficult to say what she did or rather to discover any result of her diligence she had an alarm to call her up early i know not how she occupied herself before breakfast but after that meal she divided her time into regular portions and each hour had its allotted task three times a day she studied a little book which i found on inspection was a common prayer book i asked her once what was the great attraction of that volume and she said “ the rubric ” three hours she gave to stitching with gold thread the border of a square crimson cloth almost large enough for a carpet in answer to my inquiries after the use of this article she informed me it was a covering for the altar of a new church lately erected near gateshead two hours she devoted to her diary two to working by herself in the kitchengarden and one to the regulation of her accounts she seemed to want no company no conversation i believe she was happy in her way this routine sufficed for her and nothing annoyed her so much as the occurrence of any incident which forced her to vary its clockwork regularity she told me one evening when more disposed to be communicative than usual that john ’ s conduct and the threatened ruin of the family had been a source of profound affliction to her but she had now she said settled her mind and formed her resolution her own fortune she had taken care to secure and when her mother diedand it was wholly improbable she tranquilly remarked that she should either recover or linger longshe would execute a longcherished project seek a retirement where punctual habits would be permanently secured from disturbance and place safe barriers between herself and a frivolous world i asked if georgiana would accompany her"

   "necks and faces a large old pointer dog rested its massive head on the knee of one girlin the lap of the other was cushioned a black cat a strange place was this humble kitchen for such occupants who were they they could not be the daughters of the elderly person at the table for she looked like a rustic and they were all delicacy and cultivation i had nowhere seen such faces as theirs and yet as i gazed on them i seemed intimate with every lineament i can not call them handsomethey were too pale and grave for the word as they each bent over a book they looked thoughtful almost to severity a stand between them supported a second candle and two great volumes to which they frequently referred comparing them seemingly with the smaller books they held in their hands like people consulting a dictionary to aid them in the task of translation this scene was as silent as if all the figures had been shadows and the firelit apartment a picture so hushed was it i could hear the cinders fall from the grate the clock tick in its obscure corner and i even fancied i could distinguish the clickclick of the woman ’ s knittingneedles when therefore a voice broke the strange stillness at last it was audible enough to me “ listen diana ” said one of the absorbed students “ franz and old daniel are together in the nighttime and franz is telling a dream from which he has awakened in terrorlisten ” and in a low voice she read something of which not one word was intelligible to me for it was in an unknown tongueneither french nor latin whether it were greek or german i could not tell “ that is strong ” she said when she had finished “ i relish it ” the other girl who had lifted her head to listen to her sister repeated while she gazed at the fire a line of what had been read at a later day i knew the language and the book therefore i will here quote the line though when i first heard it it was only like a stroke on sounding brass to meconveying no meaning “ ‘ da trat hervor einer anzusehen wie die sternen nacht ’ good good ” she exclaimed while her dark and deep eye sparkled “ there you have a dim and mighty archangel fitly set before you the line is worth a hundred pages of fustian ‘ ich wäge die gedanken in der schale meines zornes und die werke mit dem gewichte meines grimms ’ i like it ” both were again silent “ is there ony country where they talk i ’ that way ” asked the old woman looking up from her knitting “ yes hannaha far larger country than england where they talk in no other way ” “ well for sure case i knawn ’ t how they can understand t ’ one t ’ other and if either o ’ ye went there ye could tell what they said i guess ” “ we could probably tell something of what they said but not allfor we are not as clever as you think us hannah we don ’ t speak german and we can not read it without a dictionary to help us ” “ and what good does it do you ” “ we mean to teach it some timeor at least the elements as they say and then we shall get more money than we do now ” “ varry like but give ower studying ye ’ ve done enough for tonight ” “ i think we have at least i ’ m tired mary are you ” “ mortally after all it ’ s tough work fagging away at a language with no master but a lexicon ” “ it is especially such a language as this crabbed but glorious deutsch i wonder when st john will come home ” “ surely he will not be long now it is just ten ( looking at a little gold watch she drew from her girdle ) it rains fast hannah will you have the goodness to look at the fire in the parlour ” the woman rose she opened a door through which i dimly saw a passage soon i heard her stir a fire in an inner room she presently came back “ ah childer ” said she “ it fair troubles me to go into yond ’ room now it looks so lonesome wi ’ the chair empty and set back in a corner ” she wiped her eyes with her apron the two girls grave before looked sad now “ but he is in a better place ” continued hannah “ we shouldn ’ t wish him here again and then nobody need to have a quieter death nor he had ” “ you say he never mentioned us ” inquired one of the ladies “ he hadn ’ t time bairn he was gone in a minute was your father he had been a bit ailing like the day before but naught to signify and when mr st john asked if he would like either o ’ ye to be sent for he fair laughed at him he began again with a bit of a heaviness in his head the next daythat is a fortnight sin ’ and he went to sleep and niver wakened he wor a ’ most stark when your brother went into t ’ chamber and fand him ah childer that ’ s t ’ last o ’ t ’ old stockfor ye and mr st john is like"

   ") was soon put on my hair was soon smoothed my sole ornament the pearl brooch soon assumed we descended fortunately there was another entrance to the drawingroom than that through the saloon where they were all seated at dinner we found the apartment vacant a large fire burning silently on the marble hearth and wax candles shining in bright solitude amid the exquisite flowers with which the tables were adorned the crimson curtain hung before the arch slight as was the separation this drapery formed from the party in the adjoining saloon they spoke in so low a key that nothing of their conversation could be distinguished beyond a soothing murmur adèle who appeared to be still under the influence of a most solemnising impression sat down without a word on the footstool i pointed out to her i retired to a windowseat and taking a book from a table near endeavoured to read adèle brought her stool to my feet ere long she touched my knee “ what is it adèle ” “ estce que je ne puis pas prendre une seule de ces fleurs magnifiques mademoiselle seulement pour completer ma toilette ” “ you think too much of your ‘ toilette ’ adèle but you may have a flower ” and i took a rose from a vase and fastened it in her sash she sighed a sigh of ineffable satisfaction as if her cup of happiness were now full i turned my face away to conceal a smile i could not suppress there was something ludicrous as well as painful in the little parisienne ’ s earnest and innate devotion to matters of dress a soft sound of rising now became audible the curtain was swept back from the arch through it appeared the diningroom with its lit lustre pouring down light on the silver and glass of a magnificent dessertservice covering a long table a band of ladies stood in the opening they entered and the curtain fell behind them there were but eight yet somehow as they flocked in they gave the impression of a much larger number some of them were very tall many were dressed in white and all had a sweeping amplitude of array that seemed to magnify their persons as a mist magnifies the moon i rose and curtseyed to them one or two bent their heads in return the others only stared at me they dispersed about the room reminding me by the lightness and buoyancy of their movements of a flock of white plumy birds some of them threw themselves in halfreclining positions on the sofas and ottomans some bent over the tables and examined the flowers and books the rest gathered in a group round the fire all talked in a low but clear tone which seemed habitual to them i knew their names afterwards and may as well mention them now first there was mrs eshton and two of her daughters she had evidently been a handsome woman and was well preserved still of her daughters the eldest amy was rather little naïve and childlike in face and manner and piquant in form her white muslin dress and blue sash became her well the second louisa was taller and more elegant in figure with a very pretty face of that order the french term minois chiffoné both sisters were fair as lilies lady lynn was a large and stout personage of about forty very erect very haughtylooking richly dressed in a satin robe of changeful sheen her dark hair shone glossily under the shade of an azure plume and within the circlet of a band of gems mrs colonel dent was less showy but i thought more ladylike she had a slight figure a pale gentle face and fair hair her black satin dress her scarf of rich foreign lace and her pearl ornaments pleased me better than the rainbow radiance of the titled dame but the three most distinguishedpartly perhaps because the tallest figures of the bandwere the dowager lady ingram and her daughters blanche and mary they were all three of the loftiest stature of women the dowager might be between forty and fifty her shape was still fine her hair ( by candlelight at least ) still black her teeth too were still apparently perfect most people would have termed her a splendid woman of her age and so she was no doubt physically speaking but then there was an expression of almost insupportable haughtiness in her bearing and countenance she had roman features and a double chin disappearing into a throat like a pillar these features appeared to me not only inflated and darkened but even furrowed with pride and the chin was sustained by the same principle in a position of almost preternatural erectness she had likewise a fierce and a hard eye it reminded me of mrs reed ’ s she mouthed her words in speaking her voice was deep its inflections very pompous very dogmaticalvery intolerable in short a crimson velvet robe and a shawl turban of some goldwrought indian fabric invested her ( i suppose she thought ) with a truly imperial dignity blanche and mary were of equal staturestraight and tall as poplars mary was too slim for her height but blanche was moulded like a dian i regarded her of course with special interest first i wished to see whether her appearance accorded with mrs fairfax ’ s description secondly whether it at all resembled the fancy miniature i had"
