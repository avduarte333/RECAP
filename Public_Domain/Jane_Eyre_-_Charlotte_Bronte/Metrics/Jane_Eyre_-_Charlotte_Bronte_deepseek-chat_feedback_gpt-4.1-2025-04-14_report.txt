   "each put on a coarse straw bonnet with strings of coloured calico and a cloak of grey frieze i was similarly equipped and following the stream i made my way into the open air the garden was a wide inclosure surrounded with walls so high as to exclude every glimpse of prospect a covered verandah ran down one side and broad walks bordered a middle space divided into scores of little beds these beds were assigned as gardens for the pupils to cultivate and each bed had an owner when full of flowers they would doubtless look pretty but now at the latter end of january all was wintry blight and brown decay i shuddered as i stood and looked round me it was an inclement day for outdoor exercise not positively rainy but darkened by a drizzling yellow fog all under foot was still soaking wet with the floods of yesterday the stronger among the girls ran about and engaged in active games but sundry pale and thin ones herded together for shelter and warmth in the verandah and amongst these as the dense mist penetrated to their shivering frames i heard frequently the sound of a hollow cough as yet i had spoken to no one nor did anybody seem to take notice of me i stood lonely enough but to that feeling of isolation i was accustomed it did not oppress me much i leant against a pillar of the verandah drew my grey mantle close about me and trying to forget the cold which nipped me without and the unsatisfied hunger which gnawed me within delivered myself up to the employment of watching and thinking my reflections were too undefined and fragmentary to merit record i hardly yet knew where i was gateshead and my past life seemed floated away to an immeasurable distance the present was vague and strange and of the future i could form no conjecture i looked round the conventlike garden and then up at the housea large building half of which seemed grey and old the other half quite new the new part containing the schoolroom and dormitory was lit by mullioned and latticed windows which gave it a churchlike aspect a stone tablet over the door bore this inscription lowood institution this portion was rebuilt ad by naomi brocklehurst of brocklehurst hall in this county “ let your light so shine before men that they may see your good works and glorify your father which is in heaven ” st matt v 16 i read these words over and over again i felt that an explanation belonged to them and was unable fully to penetrate their import i was still pondering the signification of “ institution ” and endeavouring to make out a connection between the first words and the verse of scripture when the sound of a cough close behind me made me turn my head i saw a girl sitting on a stone bench near she was bent over a book on the perusal of which she seemed intent from where i stood i could see the titleit was “ rasselas ” a name that struck me as strange and consequently attractive in turning a leaf she happened to look up and i said to her directly “ is your book interesting ” i had already formed the intention of asking her to lend it to me some day “ i like it ” she answered after a pause of a second or two during which she examined me “ what is it about ” i continued i hardly know where i found the hardihood thus to open a conversation with a stranger the step was contrary to my nature and habits but i think her occupation touched a chord of sympathy somewhere for i too liked reading though of a frivolous and childish kind i could not digest or comprehend the serious or substantial “ you may look at it ” replied the girl offering me the book i did so a brief examination convinced me that the contents were less taking than the title “ rasselas ” looked dull to my trifling taste i saw nothing about fairies nothing about genii no bright variety seemed spread over the closelyprinted pages i returned it to her she received it quietly and without saying anything she was about to relapse into her former studious mood again i ventured to disturb her “ can you tell me what the writing on that stone over the door means what is lowood institution ” “ this house where you are come to live ” “ and why do they call it institution is it in any way different from other schools ” “ it is partly a charityschool you and i and all the rest of us are charitychildren i suppose you are an orphan are not either your father or your mother dead ” “ both died before i can remember ” “ well all the girls here have lost either one or both parents and this is called an institution for educating orphans ” “ do we pay no money do they keep us for nothing ” “ we pay or our friends pay fifteen pounds a year for each ” “ then why do they call us charitychildren ” “ because fifteen pounds is not enough for board and teaching and the deficiency is supplied by subscription ” “ who subscribes ” “ different benevolentminded ladies and gentlemen in this neighbourhood and in london ” “ who was naomi brocklehurst ” “ the lady who built the new part of this house as that tablet records and whose son overlooks and directs everything here ” “ why ” “ because he is treasurer and manager of the establishment ” “ then this house does not belong to that tall lady who wears a watch and who said we were to have some bread and cheese ” “ to miss temple oh no i wish it did she has to answer to mr brocklehurst for all she does mr brocklehurst buys all our food and all our clothes ” “ does he live here ” “ notwo miles off at a large hall ” “ is he a good man ” “ he is a clergyman and is said to do a great deal of good ” “ did you say that tall lady was called miss temple ” “ yes ” “ and what are the other teachers called ” “ the one with red cheeks is called miss smith she attends to the work and cuts outfor we make our own clothes our frocks and pelisses and everything the little one with black hair is miss scatcherd she teaches history and grammar and hears the second class repetitions and the one who wears a shawl and has a pockethandkerchief tied to her side with a yellow ribband is madame pierrot she comes from lisle in france and teaches french ” “ do you like the teachers ” “ well enough ” “ do you like the little black one and the madame i can not pronounce her name as you do ” “ miss scatcherd is hastyyou must take care not to offend her madame pierrot is not a bad sort of person ” “ but miss temple is the bestisn ’ t she ” “ miss temple is very good and very clever she is above the rest because she knows far more than they do ” “ have you been long here ” “ two years ” “ are you an orphan ” “ my mother is dead ” “ are you happy here ” “ you ask rather too many questions i have given you answers enough for the present now i want"

for a few moments ” he said “ that house is a mere dungeon don ’ t you feel it so ” “ it seems to me a splendid mansion sir ” “ the glamour of inexperience is over your eyes ” he answered “ and you see it through a charmed medium you can not discern that the gilding is slime and the silk draperies cobwebs that the marble is sordid slate and the polished woods mere refuse chips and scaly bark now here ” ( he pointed to the leafy enclosure we had entered ) “ all is real sweet and pure ” he strayed down a walk edged with box with apple trees pear trees and cherry trees on one side and a border on the other full of all sorts of oldfashioned flowers stocks sweetwilliams primroses pansies mingled with southernwood sweetbriar and various fragrant herbs they were fresh now as a succession of april showers and gleams followed by a lovely spring morning could make them the sun was just entering the dappled east and his light illumined the wreathed and dewy orchard trees and shone down the quiet walks under them “ jane will you have a flower ” he gathered a halfblown rose the first on the bush and offered it to me “ thank you sir ” “ do you like this sunrise jane that sky with its high and light clouds which are sure to melt away as the day waxes warmthis placid and balmly atmosphere ” “ i do very much ” “ you have passed a strange night jane ” “ yes sir ” “ and it has made you look palewere you afraid when i left you alone with mason ” “ i was afraid of some one coming out of the inner room ” “ but i had fastened the doori had the key in my pocket i should have been a careless shepherd if i had left a lambmy pet lambso near a wolf ’ s den unguarded you were safe ” “ will grace poole live here still sir ” “ oh yes don ’ t trouble your head about herput the thing out of your thoughts ” “ yet it seems to me your life is hardly secure while she stays ” “ never feari will take care of myself ” “ is the danger you apprehended last night gone by now sir ” “ i can not vouch for that till mason is out of england nor even then to live for me jane is to stand on a cratercrust which may crack and spue fire any day ” “ but mr mason seems a man easily led your influence sir is evidently potent with him he will never set you at defiance or wilfully injure you ” “ oh no mason will not defy me nor knowing it will he hurt mebut unintentionally he might in a moment by one careless word deprive me if not of life yet for ever of happiness ” “ tell him to be cautious sir let him know what you fear and show him how to avert the danger ” he laughed sardonically hastily took my hand and as hastily threw it from him “ if i could do that simpleton where would the danger be annihilated in a moment ever since i have known mason i have only had to say to him ‘ do that ’ and the thing has been done but i can not give him orders in this case i can not say ‘ beware of harming me richard ’ for it is imperative that i should keep him ignorant that harm to me is possible now you look puzzled and i will puzzle you further you are my little friend are you not ” “ i like to serve you sir and to obey you in all that is right ” “ precisely i see you do i see genuine contentment in your gait and mien your eye and face when you are helping me and pleasing meworking for me and with me in as you characteristically say ‘ all that is right ’ for if i bid you do what you thought wrong there would be no lightfooted running no neathanded alacrity no lively glance and animated complexion my friend would then turn to me quiet and pale and would say ‘ no sir that is impossible i can not do it because it is wrong ’ and would become immutable as a fixed star well you too have power over me and may injure me yet i dare not show you where i am vulnerable lest faithful and friendly as you are you should transfix me at once ” “ if you have no more to fear from mr mason than you have from me sir you are very safe ” “ god grant it may be so here jane is an arbour sit down ” the arbour was an arch in the wall lined with ivy it contained a rustic seat mr rochester took it leaving room however for me but i stood before him “ sit ” he said “ the bench is long enough for two you don ’ t hesitate to take a place at my side do you is that wrong jane ” i answered him by assuming it to refuse would i felt have been unwise “ now my little friend while the sun drinks the dewwhile all the flowers in this old garden awake and expand and the birds fetch their young ones ’ breakfast out of the thornfield and the early bees do their first spell of worki ’ ll put a case to you which you must endeavour to suppose your own but first look at me and tell me you are at ease and not fearing that i err in detaining you or that you err in staying ” “ no sir i am content ” “ well then jane call to aid your fancysuppose you were no longer a girl well reared and disciplined but a wild boy indulged from childhood upwards imagine yourself in a remote foreign land conceive that you there commit a capital error no matter of what nature or from what motives but one whose consequences must follow you through life and taint all your existence mind i don ’ t say a crime"

   "adèle had been in a state of ecstasy all day after hearing she was to be presented to the ladies in the evening and it was not till sophie commenced the operation of dressing her that she sobered down then the importance of the process quickly steadied her and by the time she had her curls arranged in wellsmoothed drooping clusters her pink satin frock put on her long sash tied and her lace mittens adjusted she looked as grave as any judge no need to warn her not to disarrange her attire when she was dressed she sat demurely down in her little chair taking care previously to lift up the satin skirt for fear she should crease it and assured me she would not stir thence till i was ready this i quickly was my best dress ( the silvergrey one purchased for miss temple ’ s wedding and never worn since ) was soon put on my hair was soon smoothed my sole ornament the pearl brooch soon assumed we descended fortunately there was another entrance to the drawingroom than that through the saloon where they were all seated at dinner we found the apartment vacant a large fire burning silently on the marble hearth and wax candles shining in bright solitude amid the exquisite flowers with which the tables were adorned the crimson curtain hung before the arch slight as was the separation this drapery formed from the party in the adjoining saloon they spoke in so low a key that nothing of their conversation could be distinguished beyond a soothing murmur adèle who appeared to be still under the influence of a most solemnising impression sat down without a word on the footstool i pointed out to her i retired to a windowseat and taking a book from a table near endeavoured to read adèle brought her stool to my feet ere long she touched my knee “ what is it adèle ” “ estce que je ne puis pas prendre une seule de ces fleurs magnifiques mademoiselle seulement pour completer ma toilette ” “ you think too much of your ‘ toilette ’ adèle but you may have a flower ” and i took a rose from a vase and fastened it in her sash she sighed a sigh of ineffable satisfaction as if her cup of happiness were now full i turned my face away to conceal a smile i could not suppress there was something ludicrous as well as painful in the little parisienne ’ s earnest and innate devotion to matters of dress a soft sound of rising now became audible the curtain was swept back from the arch through it appeared the diningroom with its lit lustre pouring down light on the silver and glass of a magnificent dessertservice covering a long table a band of ladies stood in the opening they entered and the curtain fell behind them there were but eight yet somehow as they flocked in they gave the impression of a much larger number some of them were very tall many were dressed in white and all had a sweeping amplitude of array that seemed to magnify their persons as a mist magnifies the moon i rose and curtseyed to them one or two bent their heads in return the others only stared at me they dispersed about the room reminding me by the lightness and buoyancy of their movements of a flock of white plumy birds some of them threw themselves in halfreclining positions on the sofas and ottomans some bent over the tables and examined the flowers and books the rest gathered in a group round the fire all talked in a low but clear tone which seemed habitual to them i knew their names afterwards and may as well mention them now first there was mrs eshton and two of her daughters she had evidently been a handsome woman and was well preserved still of her daughters the eldest amy was rather little naïve and childlike in face and manner and piquant in form her white muslin dress and blue sash became her well the second louisa was taller and more elegant in figure with a very pretty face of that order the french term minois chiffoné both sisters were fair as lilies lady lynn was a large and stout personage of about forty very erect very haughtylooking richly dressed in a satin robe of changeful sheen her dark hair shone glossily under the shade of an azure plume and within the circlet of a band of gems mrs colonel dent was less showy but i thought more ladylike she had a slight figure a pale gentle face and fair hair her black satin dress her scarf of rich foreign lace and her pearl ornaments pleased me better than the rainbow radiance of the titled dame but the three most distinguishedpartly perhaps because the tallest figures of the bandwere the dowager lady ingram and her daughters blanche and mary they were all three of the loftiest stature of women the dowager might be between forty and fifty her shape was still fine her hair ( by candlelight at least ) still black her teeth too were still apparently perfect most people would have termed her a splendid woman of her age and so she was no doubt physically speaking but then there was an expression of almost insupportable haughtiness in her bearing and countenance she had roman features and a double chin disappearing into a throat like a pillar these features appeared to me not only inflated and darkened but even furrowed with pride and the chin was sustained by the same principle in a position of almost preternatural erectness she had likewise a fierce and a hard eye it reminded me of mrs reed ’ s she mouthed her words in speaking her voice was deep its inflections very pompous very dogmaticalvery intolerable in short a crimson velvet robe and a shawl turban of some goldwrought indian fabric invested her ( i suppose she thought ) with a truly imperial dignity blanche and mary were of equal staturestraight and tall as poplars mary was too slim for her height but blanche was moulded like a dian i regarded her of course with special interest first i wished to see whether her appearance accorded with mrs fairfax ’ s description secondly whether it at all resembled the fancy miniature i had"
