   "i approached it it was a road or a track it led straight up to the light which now beamed from a sort of knoll amidst a clump of treesfirs apparently from what i could distinguish of the character of their forms and foliage through the gloom my star vanished as i drew near some obstacle had intervened between me and it i put out my hand to feel the dark mass before me i discriminated the rough stones of a low wallabove it something like palisades and within a high and prickly hedge i groped on again a whitish object gleamed before me it was a gatea wicket it moved on its hinges as i touched it on each side stood a sable bushholly or yew entering the gate and passing the shrubs the silhouette of a house rose to view black low and rather long but the guiding light shone nowhere all was obscurity were the inmates retired to rest i feared it must be so in seeking the door i turned an angle there shot out the friendly gleam again from the lozenged panes of a very small latticed window within a foot of the ground made still smaller by the growth of ivy or some other creeping plant whose leaves clustered thick over the portion of the house wall in which it was set the aperture was so screened and narrow that curtain or shutter had been deemed unnecessary and when i stooped down and put aside the spray of foliage shooting over it i could see all within i could see clearly a room with a sanded floor clean scoured a dresser of walnut with pewter plates ranged in rows reflecting the redness and radiance of a glowing peatfire i could see a clock a white deal table some chairs the candle whose ray had been my beacon burnt on the table and by its light an elderly woman somewhat roughlooking but scrupulously clean like all about her was knitting a stocking i noticed these objects cursorily onlyin them there was nothing extraordinary a group of more interest appeared near the hearth sitting still amidst the rosy peace and warmth suffusing it two young graceful womenladies in every pointsat one in a low rockingchair the other on a lower stool both wore deep mourning of crape and bombazeen which sombre garb singularly set off very fair necks and faces a large old pointer dog rested its massive head on the knee of one girlin the lap of the other was cushioned a black cat a strange place was this humble kitchen for such occupants who were they they could not be the daughters of the elderly person at the table for she looked like a rustic and they were all delicacy and cultivation i had nowhere seen such faces as theirs and yet as i gazed on them i seemed intimate with every lineament i can not call them handsomethey were too pale and grave for the word as they each bent over a book they looked thoughtful almost to severity a stand between them supported a second candle and two great volumes to which they frequently referred comparing them seemingly with the smaller books they held in their hands like people consulting a dictionary to aid them in the task of translation this scene was as silent as if all the figures had been shadows and the firelit apartment a picture so hushed was it i could hear the cinders fall from the grate the clock tick in its obscure corner and i even fancied i could distinguish the clickclick of the woman ’ s knittingneedles when therefore a voice broke the strange stillness at last it was audible enough to me “ listen diana ” said one of the absorbed students “ franz and old daniel are together in the nighttime and franz is telling a dream from which he has awakened in terrorlisten ” and in a low voice she read something of which not one word was intelligible to me for it was in an unknown tongueneither french nor latin whether it were greek or german i could not tell “ that is strong ” she said when she had finished “ i relish it ” the other girl who had lifted her head to listen to her sister repeated while she gazed at the fire a line of what had been read at a later day i knew the language and the book therefore i will here quote the line though when i first heard it it was only like a stroke on sounding brass to meconveying no meaning “ ‘ da trat hervor einer anzusehen wie die sternen nacht ’ good good ” she exclaimed while her dark and deep eye sparkled “ there you have a dim and mighty archangel fitly set before you the line is worth a hundred pages of fustian ‘ ich wäge die gedanken in der schale meines zornes und die werke mit dem gewichte meines grimms ’ i like it ” both were again silent “ is there ony country where they talk i ’ that way ” asked the old woman looking up from her knitting “ yes hannaha far larger country than england where they talk in no other way ” “ well for sure case i knawn ’ t how they can understand t ’ one t ’ other and if either o ’ ye went there ye could tell what they said i guess ” “ we could probably tell something of what they said but not allfor we are not as clever as you think us hannah we don ’ t speak german and we can not read it without a dictionary to help us ” “ and what good does it do you ” “ we mean to teach it some timeor at least the elements as they say and then we shall get more money than we do now ” “ varry like but give ower studying ye ’ ve done enough for tonight ” “ i think we have at least i ’ m tired mary are you ” “ mortally after all it ’ s tough work fagging away at a language with no master but a lexicon ” “ it is especially such a language as this crabbed but glorious deutsch i wonder when st john will come home ” “ surely he will not be long now it is just ten ( looking at a little gold watch she drew from her girdle ) it rains fast hannah will you have the goodness to look at the fire in the parlour ” the woman rose she opened a door through which i dimly saw a passage soon i heard her stir a fire in an inner room she presently came back “ ah childer ” said she “ it fair troubles me to go into yond ’ room now it looks so lonesome wi ’ the chair empty and set back in a corner ” she wiped her eyes with her apron the two girls grave before looked sad now “ but he is in a better place ” continued hannah “ we shouldn ’ t wish him here again and then nobody need to have a quieter death nor he had ” “ you say he never mentioned us ” inquired one of the ladies “ he hadn ’ t time bairn he was gone in a minute was your father he had been a bit ailing like the day before but naught to signify and when mr st john asked if he would like either o ’ ye to be sent for he fair laughed at him he began again with a bit of a heaviness in his head the next daythat is a fortnight sin ’ and he went to sleep and niver wakened he wor a ’ most stark when your brother went into t ’ chamber and fand him ah childer that ’ s t ’ last o ’ t ’ old stockfor ye and mr st john is like of different soart to them ’ at ’ s gone for all your mother wor mich i ’ your way and a ’ most as booklearned she wor the pictur ’ o ’ ye mary diana is more like your father ” i thought them so similar i could not tell where the old servant ( for such i now concluded her to be ) saw the difference both were fair complexioned and slenderly made both possessed faces full of distinction and intelligence one to be sure had hair a shade darker than the other and there was a difference in their style of wearing it mary ’ s pale brown locks were parted and braided smooth diana ’ s duskier tresses covered her neck with thick curls the clock struck ten “ ye ’ ll want your supper i am sure ” observed hannah “ and so will mr st john when he comes in ” and she proceeded to prepare the meal the ladies rose they seemed about to withdraw to the parlour till this moment i had been so intent on watching them their appearance and conversation had excited"

   "surrounded with walls so high as to exclude every glimpse of prospect a covered verandah ran down one side and broad walks bordered a middle space divided into scores of little beds these beds were assigned as gardens for the pupils to cultivate and each bed had an owner when full of flowers they would doubtless look pretty but now at the latter end of january all was wintry blight and brown decay i shuddered as i stood and looked round me it was an inclement day for outdoor exercise not positively rainy but darkened by a drizzling yellow fog all under foot was still soaking wet with the floods of yesterday the stronger among the girls ran about and engaged in active games but sundry pale and thin ones herded together for shelter and warmth in the verandah and amongst these as the dense mist penetrated to their shivering frames i heard frequently the sound of a hollow cough as yet i had spoken to no one nor did anybody seem to take notice of me i stood lonely enough but to that feeling of isolation i was accustomed it did not oppress me much i leant against a pillar of the verandah drew my grey mantle close about me and trying to forget the cold which nipped me without and the unsatisfied hunger which gnawed me within delivered myself up to the employment of watching and thinking my reflections were too undefined and fragmentary to merit record i hardly yet knew where i was gateshead and my past life seemed floated away to an immeasurable distance the present was vague and strange and of the future i could form no conjecture i looked round the conventlike garden and then up at the housea large building half of which seemed grey and old the other half quite new the new part containing the schoolroom and dormitory was lit by mullioned and latticed windows which gave it a churchlike aspect a stone tablet over the door bore this inscription lowood institution this portion was rebuilt ad by naomi brocklehurst of brocklehurst hall in this county “ let your light so shine before men that they may see your good works and glorify your father which is in heaven ” st matt v 16 i read these words over and over again i felt that an explanation belonged to them and was unable fully to penetrate their import i was still pondering the signification of “ institution ” and endeavouring to make out a connection between the first words and the verse of scripture when the sound of a cough close behind me made me turn my head i saw a girl sitting on a stone bench near she was bent over a book on the perusal of which she seemed intent from where i stood i could see the titleit was “ rasselas ” a name that struck me as strange and consequently attractive in turning a leaf she happened to look up and i said to her directly “ is your book interesting ” i had already formed the intention of asking her to lend it to me some day “ i like it ” she answered after a pause of a second or two during which she examined me “ what is it about ” i continued i hardly know where i found the hardihood thus to open a conversation with a stranger the step was contrary to my nature and habits but i think her occupation touched a chord of sympathy somewhere for i too liked reading though of a frivolous and childish kind i could not digest or comprehend the serious or substantial “ you may look at it ” replied the girl offering me the book i did so a brief examination convinced me that the contents were less taking than the title “ rasselas ” looked dull to my trifling taste i saw nothing about fairies nothing about genii no bright variety seemed spread over the closelyprinted pages i returned it to her she received it quietly and without saying anything she was about to relapse into her former studious mood again i ventured to disturb her “ can you tell me what the writing on that stone over the door means what is lowood institution ” “ this house where you are come to live ” “ and why do they call it institution is it in any way different from other schools ” “ it is partly a charityschool you and i and all the rest of us are charitychildren i suppose you are an orphan are not either your father or your mother dead ” “ both died before i can remember ” “ well all the girls here have lost either one or both parents and this is called an institution for educating orphans ” “ do we pay no money do they keep us for nothing ” “ we pay or our friends pay fifteen pounds a year for each ” “ then why do they call us charitychildren ” “ because fifteen pounds is not enough for board and teaching and the deficiency is supplied by subscription ” “ who subscribes ” “ different benevolentminded ladies and gentlemen in this neighbourhood and in london ” “ who was naomi brocklehurst ” “ the lady who built the new part of this house as that tablet records and whose son overlooks and directs everything here ” “ why ” “ because he is treasurer and manager of the establishment ” “ then this house does not belong to that tall lady who wears a watch and who said we were to have some bread and cheese ” “ to miss temple oh no i wish it did she has to answer to mr brocklehurst for all she does mr brocklehurst buys all our food and all our clothes ” “ does he live here ” “ notwo miles off at a large hall ” “ is he a good man ” “ he is a clergyman and is said to do a great deal of good ” “ did you say that tall lady was called miss temple ” “ yes ” “ and what are the other teachers called ” “ the one with red cheeks is called miss smith she attends to the work and cuts outfor we make our own clothes our

in no shape denote admiration “ no miss jane not exactly you are genteel enough you look like a lady and it is as much as ever i expected of you you were no beauty as a child ” i smiled at bessie ’ s frank answer i felt that it was correct but i confess i was not quite indifferent to its import at eighteen most people wish to please and the conviction that they have not an exterior likely to second that desire brings anything but gratification “ i dare say you are clever though ” continued bessie by way of solace “ what can you do can you play on the piano ” “ a little ” there was one in the room bessie went and opened it and then asked me to sit down and give her a tune i played a waltz or two and she was charmed “ the miss reeds could not play as well ” said she exultingly “ i always said you would surpass them in learning and can you draw ” “ that is one of my paintings over the chimneypiece ” it was a landscape in water colours of which i had made a present to the superintendent in acknowledgment of her obliging mediation with the committee on my behalf and which she had framed and glazed “ well that is beautiful miss jane it is as fine a picture as any miss

afraid you are disappointed in me bessie ” i said this laughing i perceived that bessie ’ s glance though it expressed regard did in no shape denote admiration “ no miss jane not exactly you are genteel enough you look like a lady and it is as much as ever i expected of you you were no beauty as a child ” i smiled at bessie ’ s frank answer i felt that it was correct but i confess i was not quite indifferent to its import at eighteen most people wish to please and the conviction that they have not an exterior likely to second that desire brings anything but gratification “ i dare say you are clever though ” continued bessie by way of solace “ what can you do can you play on the piano ” “ a little ” there was one in the room bessie went and opened it and then asked me to sit down and give her a tune i played a waltz or two and she was charmed “ the miss reeds could not play as well ” said she exultingly “ i always said you would surpass them in learning and can you draw ” “ that is one of my paintings over the chimneypiece ” it was a landscape in water colours of which i had made a present to the superintendent in acknowledgment of her obliging mediation with the committee on my behalf and which she had framed and glazed “ well that is beautiful miss jane it is as fine a picture as any miss reed ’ s drawingmaster could paint let alone the young ladies themselves who could not come near it and have you learnt french ” “ yes bessie i can both read it and speak it ” “ and you can work on muslin and canvas ” “ i can ” “ oh you are quite a lady miss jane i knew you would be you will get on whether your relations notice you or not there was something i wanted to ask you have you ever heard anything from your father ’ s kinsfolk the eyres ” “ never in my life ” “ well you know missis always said they were poor and quite despicable and they may be poor but i believe they are as much gentry as the reeds are for one day nearly seven years ago a mr eyre came to gateshead and wanted to see you missis said you were at school fifty miles off he seemed so much disappointed for he could not stay he was going on a voyage to a foreign country and the ship was to sail from london in a day or two he looked quite a gentleman and i believe he was your father ’ s brother ” “ what foreign country was he going to bessie ” “ an island thousands of miles off where they make winethe butler did tell me ” “ madeira ” i suggested “ yes that is itthat is the very word ” “ so he went ” “ yes he did not stay many minutes in the house missis was very high with him she called him afterwards a ‘ sneaking tradesman ’ my robert believes he was a winemerchant ” “ very likely ” i returned “ or perhaps clerk or agent to a winemerchant"

   "adèle had been in a state of ecstasy all day after hearing she was to be presented to the ladies in the evening and it was not till sophie commenced the operation of dressing her that she sobered down then the importance of the process quickly steadied her and by the time she had her curls arranged in wellsmoothed drooping clusters her pink satin frock put on her long sash tied and her lace mittens adjusted she looked as grave as any judge no need to warn her not to disarrange her attire when she was dressed she sat demurely down in her little chair taking care previously to lift up the satin skirt for fear she should crease it and assured me she would not stir thence till i was ready this i quickly was my best dress ( the silvergrey one purchased for miss temple ’ s wedding and never worn since ) was soon put on my hair was soon smoothed my sole ornament the pearl brooch soon assumed we descended fortunately there was another entrance to the drawingroom than that through the saloon where they were all seated at dinner we found the apartment vacant a large fire burning silently on the marble hearth and wax candles shining in bright solitude amid the exquisite flowers with which the tables were adorned the crimson curtain hung before the arch slight as was the separation this drapery formed from the party in the adjoining saloon they spoke in so low a key that nothing of their conversation could be distinguished beyond a soothing murmur adèle who appeared to be still under the influence of a most solemnising impression sat down without a word on the footstool i pointed out to her i retired to a windowseat and taking a book from a table near endeavoured to read adèle brought her stool to my feet ere long she touched my knee “ what is it adèle ” “ estce que je ne puis pas prendre une seule de ces fleurs magnifiques mademoiselle seulement pour completer ma toilette ” “ you think too much of your ‘ toilette ’ adèle but you may have a flower ” and i took a rose from a vase and fastened it in her sash she sighed a sigh of ineffable satisfaction as if her cup of happiness were now full i turned my face away to conceal a smile i could not suppress there was something ludicrous as well as painful in the little parisienne ’ s earnest and innate devotion to matters of dress a soft sound of rising now became audible the curtain was swept back from the arch through it appeared the diningroom with its lit lustre pouring down light on the silver and glass of a magnificent dessertservice covering a long table a band of ladies stood in the opening they entered and the curtain fell behind them there were but eight yet somehow as they flocked in they gave the impression of a much larger number some of them were very tall many were dressed in white and all had a sweeping amplitude of array that seemed to magnify their persons as a mist magnifies the moon i rose and curtseyed to them one or two bent their heads in return the others only stared at me they dispersed about the room reminding me by the lightness and buoyancy of their movements of a flock of white plumy birds some of them threw themselves in halfreclining positions on the sofas and ottomans some bent over the tables and examined the flowers and books the rest gathered in a group round the fire all talked in a low but clear tone which seemed habitual to them i knew their names afterwards and may as well mention them now first there was mrs eshton and two of her daughters she had evidently been a handsome woman and was well preserved still of her daughters the eldest amy was rather little naïve and childlike in face and manner and piquant in form her white muslin dress and blue sash became her well the second louisa was taller and more elegant in figure with a very pretty face of that order the french term minois chiffoné both sisters were fair as lilies lady lynn was a large and stout personage of about forty very erect very haughtylooking richly dressed in a satin robe of changeful sheen her dark hair shone glossily under the shade of an azure plume and within the circlet of a band of gems mrs colonel dent was less showy but i thought more ladylike she had a slight figure a pale gentle face and fair hair her black satin dress her scarf of rich foreign lace and her pearl ornaments pleased me better than the rainbow radiance of the titled dame but the three most distinguishedpartly perhaps because the tallest figures of the bandwere the dowager lady ingram and her daughters blanche and mary they were all three of the loftiest stature of women the dowager might be between forty and fifty her shape was still fine her hair ( by candlelight at least ) still black her teeth too were still apparently perfect most people would have termed her a splendid woman of her age and so she was no doubt physically speaking but then there was an expression of almost insupportable haughtiness in her bearing and countenance she had roman features and a double chin disappearing into a throat like a pillar these features appeared to me not only inflated and darkened but even furrowed with pride and the chin was sustained by the same principle in a position of almost preternatural erectness she had likewise a fierce and a hard eye it reminded me of mrs reed ’ s she mouthed her words in speaking her voice was deep its inflections very pompous very dogmaticalvery intolerable in short a crimson velvet robe and a shawl turban of some goldwrought indian fabric invested her ( i suppose she thought ) with a truly imperial dignity blanche and mary were of equal staturestraight and tall as poplars mary was too slim for her height but blanche was moulded like a dian i regarded her of course with special interest first i wished to see whether her
