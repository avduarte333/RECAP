   "i felt the impression of woe as she spoke but i could not tell whence it came and when having done speaking she breathed a little fast and coughed a short cough i momentarily forgot my own sorrows to yield to a vague concern for her resting my head on helen ’ s shoulder i put my arms round her waist she drew me to her and we reposed in silence we had not sat long thus when another person came in some heavy clouds swept from the sky by a rising wind had left the moon bare and her light streaming in through a window near shone full both on us and on the approaching figure which we at once recognised as miss temple “ i came on purpose to find you jane eyre ” said she “ i want you in my room and as helen burns is with you she may come too ” we went following the superintendent ’ s guidance we had to thread some intricate passages and mount a staircase before we reached her apartment it contained a good fire and looked cheerful miss temple told helen burns to be seated in a low armchair on one side of the hearth and herself taking another she called me to her side “ is it all over ” she asked looking down at my face “ have you cried your grief away ” “ i am afraid i never shall do that ” “ why ” “ because i have been wrongly accused and you ma ’ am and everybody else will now think me wicked ” “ we shall think you what you prove yourself to be my child continue to act as a good girl and you will satisfy us ” “ shall i miss temple ” “ you will ” said she passing her arm round me “ and now tell me who is the lady whom mr brocklehurst called your benefactress ” “ mrs reed my uncle ’ s wife my uncle is dead and he left me to her care ” “ did she not then adopt you of her own accord ” “ no ma ’ am she was sorry to have to do it but my uncle as i have often heard the servants say got her to promise before he died that she would always keep me ” “ well now jane you know or at least i will tell you that when a criminal is accused he is always allowed to speak in his own defence you have been charged with falsehood defend yourself to me as well as you can say whatever your memory suggests is true but add nothing and exaggerate nothing ” i resolved in the depth of my heart that i would be most moderatemost correct and having reflected a few minutes in order to arrange coherently what i had to say i told her all the story of my sad childhood exhausted by emotion my language was more subdued than it generally was when it developed that sad theme and mindful of helen ’ s warnings against the indulgence of resentment i infused into the narrative far less of gall and wormwood than ordinary thus restrained and simplified it sounded more credible i felt as i went on that miss temple fully believed me in the course of the tale i had mentioned mr lloyd as having come to see me after the fit"

   "christmas and the new year had been celebrated at gateshead with the usual festive cheer presents had been interchanged dinners and evening parties given from every enjoyment i was of course excluded my share of the gaiety consisted in witnessing the daily apparelling of eliza and georgiana and seeing them descend to the drawingroom dressed out in thin muslin frocks and scarlet sashes with hair elaborately ringletted and afterwards in listening to the sound of the piano or the harp played below to the passing to and fro of the butler and footman to the jingling of glass and china as refreshments were handed to the broken hum of conversation as the drawingroom door opened and closed when tired of this occupation i would retire from the stairhead to the solitary and silent nursery there though somewhat sad i was not miserable to speak truth i had not the least wish to go into company for in company i was very rarely noticed and if bessie had but been kind and companionable i should have deemed it a treat to spend the evenings quietly with her instead of passing them under the formidable eye of mrs reed in a room full of ladies and gentlemen but bessie as soon as she had dressed her young ladies used to take herself off to the lively regions of the kitchen and housekeeper ’ s room generally bearing the candle along with her i then sat with my doll on my knee till the fire got low glancing round occasionally to make sure that nothing worse than myself haunted the shadowy room and when the embers sank to a dull red i undressed hastily tugging at knots and strings as i best might and sought shelter from cold and darkness in my crib to this crib i always took my doll human beings must love something and in the dearth of worthier objects of affection i contrived to find a pleasure in loving and cherishing a faded graven image shabby as a miniature scarecrow it puzzles me now to remember with what absurd sincerity i doated on this little toy half fancying it alive and capable of sensation i could not sleep unless it was folded in my nightgown and when it lay there safe and warm i was comparatively happy believing it to be"

   "i should if i had deliberated have replied to this question by something conventionally vague and polite but the answer somehow slipped from my tongue before i was aware “ no sir ” “ ah by my word there is something singular about you ” said he “ you have the air of a little nonnette quaint quiet grave and simple as you sit with your hands before you and your eyes generally bent on the carpet ( except bythebye when they are directed piercingly to my face as just now for instance ) and when one asks you a question or makes a remark to which you are obliged to reply you rap out a round rejoinder which if not blunt is at least brusque what do you mean by it ” “ sir i was too plain i beg your pardon i ought to have replied that it was not easy to give an impromptu answer to a question about appearances that tastes mostly differ and that beauty is of little consequence or something of that sort ” “ you ought to have replied no such thing beauty of little consequence indeed and so under pretence of softening the previous outrage of stroking and soothing me into placidity you stick a sly penknife under my ear go on what fault do you find with me pray i suppose i have all my limbs and all my features like any other man ” “ mr rochester allow me to disown my first answer i intended no pointed repartee it was only a blunder ” “ just so i think so and you shall be answerable for it criticise me does my forehead not please you ” he lifted up the sable waves of hair which lay horizontally over his brow and showed a solid enough mass of intellectual organs but an abrupt deficiency where the suave sign of benevolence should have risen “ now ma ’ am am i a fool ” “ far from it sir you would perhaps think me rude if i inquired in return whether you are a philanthropist ” “ there again another stick of the penknife when she pretended to pat my head and that is because i said i did not like the society of children and old women"

   "more of intercourse with my kind of acquaintance with variety of character than was here within my reach i valued what was good in mrs fairfax and what was good in adèle but i believed in the existence of other and more vivid kinds of goodness and what i believed in i wished to behold who blames me many no doubt and i shall be called discontented i could not help it the restlessness was in my nature it agitated me to pain sometimes then my sole relief was to walk along the corridor of the third storey backwards and forwards safe in the silence and solitude of the spot and allow my mind ’ s eye to dwell on whatever bright visions rose before itand certainly they were many and glowing to let my heart be heaved by the exultant movement which while it swelled it in trouble expanded it with life and best of all to open my inward ear to a tale that was never endeda tale my imagination created and narrated continuously quickened with all of incident life fire feeling that i desired and had not in my actual existence it is in vain to say human beings ought to be satisfied with tranquillity they must have action and they will make it if they can not find it millions are condemned to a stiller doom than mine and millions are in silent revolt against their lot nobody knows how many rebellions besides political rebellions ferment in the masses of life which people earth women are supposed to be very calm generally but women feel just as men feel they need exercise for their faculties and a field for their efforts as much as their brothers do they suffer from too rigid a restraint too absolute a stagnation precisely as men would suffer and it is narrowminded in their more privileged fellowcreatures to say that they ought to confine themselves to making puddings and knitting stockings to playing on the piano and embroidering bags it is thoughtless to condemn them or laugh at them if they seek to do more or learn more than custom has pronounced necessary"
