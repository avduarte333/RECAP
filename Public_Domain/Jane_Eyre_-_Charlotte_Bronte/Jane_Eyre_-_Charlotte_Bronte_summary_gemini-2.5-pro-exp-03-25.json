Second, to the Press, for giving a fair opportunity and support to a previously unknown writer. Third, to my Publishers, whose good judgment, enthusiasm, practical advice, and generosity have greatly helped an unrecognized and unendorsed author like myself.

I mean the timorous or carping few who doubt the tendency of such books as “Jane Eyre:” in whose eyes whatever is unusual is wrong; whose ears detect in each protest against bigotry—that parent of crime—an insult to piety, that regent of God on earth. I would suggest to such doubters certain obvious distinctions; I would remind them of certain simple truths.\nConventionality is not morality. Self-righteousness is not religion. To attack the first is not to assail the last. To pluck the mask from the face of the Pharisee, is not to lift an impious hand to the Crown of Thorns.\nThese things and deeds are diametrically opposed: they are as distinct as is vice from virtue. Men too often confound them: they should not be confounded: appearance should not be mistaken for truth; narrow human doctrines, that only tend to elate and magnify a few, should not be substituted for the world-redeeming creed of Christ. There is—I repeat it—a difference; and it is a good, and not a bad action to mark broadly and clearly the line of separation between them.",

I am referring to the few who are hesitant or critical, questioning the purpose of books like “Jane Eyre.” In their judgment, anything out of the ordinary is wrong; they perceive in every objection to prejudice – the root of crime – an attack on genuine faith, which they see as God's authority on earth. To such doubters, I would propose certain evident distinctions; I would remind them of basic truths. Conforming to convention is not the same as morality. Being self-righteous is not the same as being religious. Challenging the former does not mean assaulting the latter. Removing the disguise from a hypocrite is not equivalent to lifting an unholy hand against sacred things. These things and actions are completely opposite: they are as different as bad is from good. People too often confuse them; they ought not to be confused: superficial appearance should not be mistaken for reality; limited human teachings, which merely serve to promote and benefit a select few, should not replace Christ's belief system that offers redemption to the world. There is – I repeat it – a difference; and clearly and widely indicating the boundary between them is a good, not a bad, action.",

I am referring to the anxious or critical people who are suspicious of books like \"Jane Eyre,\" believing that anything unusual must be wrong, and thinking that any criticism of bigotry—which leads to wrongdoing—is somehow an attack on true piety, which they regard as divinely sanctioned. To these critics, I would point out some clear differences and remind them of some simple facts. Observing social conventions is not the same as being moral. Being self-righteous is not the same as being religious. Criticizing the first does not mean attacking the second. Exposing hypocrisy is not the same as disrespecting the sacred. These things are completely different; they are as opposite as vice and virtue. People often confuse them, but they should not. Outward appearances shouldn't be mistaken for genuine truth; narrow teachings that serve only a select few should not replace the universal message of Christ. There truly is a difference, and it is right—not wrong—to clearly show the separation between them."

It may intensely dislike anyone who dares to examine closely and reveal what lies beneath, stripping away the pleasant exterior to expose imperfections, or looking into hidden, unpleasant truths. Nevertheless, despite this hostility, society benefits from such individuals. Consider King Ahab, who disliked the prophet Micaiah because he never prophesied good concerning him, only misfortune; he probably preferred the flattering prophet, the son of Chenaanah. Yet, Ahab might have avoided a violent death had he ignored the flattery and instead heeded the honest advice.",

Some might resent those who question this and bring hidden flaws to light, exposing what’s beneath the surface and uncovering unpleasant truths. Yet, despite their anger, they owe much to such truth-tellers. In the same way, Ahab disliked Micaiah because he never brought him good news, only bad; perhaps he preferred flattering prophets, but if Ahab had listened to honest advice instead of false praise, he might have avoided his violent end."

Is the satirist of “Vanity Fair” admired in high places?

I have alluded to him, Reader, because I think I see in him an intellect profounder and more unique than his contemporaries have yet recognised; because I regard him as the first social regenerator of the day—as the very master of that working corps who would restore to rectitude the warped system of things; because I think no commentator on his writings has yet found the comparison that suits him, the terms which rightly characterise his talent. They say he is like Fielding: they talk of his wit, humour, comic powers. He resembles Fielding as an eagle does a vulture: Fielding could stoop on carrion, but Thackeray never does.

This writer speaks profound truths with prophetic strength and fearless courage. The author is unsure if this satirist, the creator of “Vanity Fair,” is popular among the elite, but suggests that if those he targets with his sharp satire and harsh criticisms were to take his warnings seriously in time, they or their descendants might avoid a fatal disaster. The author explains the reason for mentioning this writer: he believes this individual possesses an intellect deeper and more exceptional than currently recognized by his peers. He views him as the foremost social reformer of the time, a master leading the effort to correct societal wrongs. He feels that commentators have not yet found the appropriate comparison or language to truly characterize his talent. While some compare him to Fielding, mentioning his wit, humor, and comic abilities, the author sees a vast difference, like an eagle versus a vulture; Fielding might dwell on negativity, but Thackeray does not. His wit is brilliant and his humor appealing, but they are secondary to his serious genius, like faint sheet lightning compared to a hidden, powerful electric spark.

I do not know whether the satirist of 'Vanity Fair' is esteemed in lofty circles, but I believe that if some of those he criticizes so harshly were to heed his warnings in time, they or their descendants might avoid disastrous consequences. Why have I mentioned this man? Reader, I reference him because I see in him an intellect deeper and more distinctive than his peers recognize—I regard him as the foremost social reformer of our time, the true leader among those striving to straighten society’s twisted ways. No critic, I think, has yet accurately compared him or described his brilliance. People liken him to Fielding, praising his wit, humor, and comic talent. To me, however, he is to Fielding as an eagle is to a vulture: Fielding could sink to the unworthy, while Thackeray never does. His wit is sharp, and his humor delightful, but these are to his serious genius as mere flashes of lightning are to the powerful electricity hidden within a storm. Ultimately, I mention Mr. Thackeray because I dedicate this second edition of 'Jane Eyre' to him, if he will accept this tribute from a complete stranger. CURRER BELL. December 21st, 1847."

Find a seat somewhere; and remain quiet until you can speak in a pleasant way.\"",

Although we had spent about an hour wandering through the bare shrubs in the morning, after lunch (which Mrs. Reed took early if there weren't any guests) the winter wind brought dark clouds and a cold, penetrating rain, making it impossible to go outside again. I was actually relieved; I never enjoyed long walks, particularly on cold afternoons. I hated returning in the chilly dusk, my fingers and toes numb, and feeling depressed by Bessie's scolding and by my own sense of being physically weaker than Eliza, John, and Georgiana Reed. Those three were now gathered around their mother in the drawing room. Mrs. Reed was reclining on the sofa by the fire, appearing completely happy with her children around her—all behaving for once. She had told me not to join them, saying that she was sorry, but until she could tell from Bessie or see for herself that I was truly trying to be friendlier and more cheerful—in other words, more like a happy normal child—she had to deny me the company of the others. I asked her what Bessie said I had done wrong. She replied that she didn't like children who question their elders, and that I should sit somewhere quietly and not speak until I could do so pleasantly."

It contained a bookcase: I soon possessed myself of a volume, taking care that it should be one stored with pictures. I mounted into the window-seat: gathering up my feet, I sat cross-legged, like a Turk; and, having drawn the red moreen curtain nearly close, I was shrined in double retirement.\nFolds of scarlet drapery shut in my view to the right hand; to the left were the clear panes of glass, protecting, but not separating me from the drear November day. At intervals, while turning over the leaves of my book, I studied the aspect of that winter afternoon. Afar, it offered a pale blank of mist and cloud; near a scene of wet lawn and storm-beat shrub, with ceaseless rain sweeping away wildly before a long and lamentable blast.\nI returned to my book—Bewick’s History of British Birds: the letterpress thereof I cared little for, generally speaking; and yet there were certain introductory pages that, child as I was, I could not pass quite as a blank. They were those which treat of the haunts of sea-fowl; of “the solitary rocks and promontories” by them only inhabited; of the coast of Norway, studded with isles from its southern extremity, the Lindeness, or Naze, to the North Cape—\n“Where the Northern Ocean, in vast whirls,\nBoils round the naked, melancholy isles\nOf farthest Thule; and the Atlantic surge\nPours in among the stormy Hebrides.”\nNor could I pass unnoticed the suggestion of the bleak shores of Lapland, Siberia, Spitzbergen, Nova Zembla, Iceland, Greenland, with “the vast sweep of the Arctic Zone, and those forlorn regions of dreary space,—that reservoir of frost and snow, where firm fields of ice, the accumulation of centuries of winters, glazed in Alpine heights above heights, surround the pole, and concentre the multiplied rigours of extreme cold.” Of these death-white realms I formed an idea of my own: shadowy, like all the half-comprehended notions that float dim through children’s brains, but strangely impressive. The words in these introductory pages connected themselves with the succeeding vignettes, and gave significance to the rock standing up alone in a sea of billow and spray; to the broken boat stranded on a desolate coast; to the cold and ghastly moon glancing through bars of cloud at a wreck just sinking.\nI cannot tell what sentiment haunted the quite solitary churchyard, with its inscribed headstone; its gate, its two trees, its low horizon, girdled by a broken wall, and its newly-risen crescent, attesting the hour of eventide.\nThe two ships becalmed on a torpid sea, I believed to be marine phantoms.\nThe fiend pinning down the thief’s pack behind him, I passed over quickly: it was an object of terror.\nSo was the black horned thing seated aloof on a rock, surveying a distant crowd surrounding a gallows.\nEach picture told a story; mysterious often to my undeveloped understanding and imperfect feelings, yet ever profoundly interesting: as interesting as the tales Bessie sometimes narrated on winter evenings, when she chanced to be in good humour; and when, having brought her ironing-table to the nursery hearth, she allowed us to sit about it, and while she got up Mrs. Reed’s lace frills, and crimped her nightcap borders, fed our eager attention with passages of love and adventure taken from old fairy tales and other ballads; or (as at a later period I discovered) from the pages of Pamela, and Henry, Earl of Moreland.\nWith Bewick on my knee, I was then happy: happy at least in my way. I feared nothing but interruption, and that came too soon.",
          "paraphrase_gemini-2.5-flash-preview-04-17": "I entered the breakfast-room next to the drawing-room. Inside, I found a bookcase and quickly chose a book, making sure it contained illustrations. I climbed onto the window seat, curled my feet under me like a Turk, and pulled the red curtain nearly shut, creating a private, secluded space. The thick scarlet fabric blocked the view to my right, while the clear windowpanes to my left provided a sheltered glimpse of the gloomy November day outside, without completely separating me from it. Occasionally, as I turned the pages of my book, I observed the scene of that winter afternoon. Distantly, it appeared as a pale expanse of mist and clouds, while closer to the house, it showed a wet lawn and storm-battered shrubs, with relentless rain being driven wildly by a long, mournful wind. I returned to my book, which was Bewick's History of British Birds. Generally, I paid little attention to the written text, but there were specific opening sections that, despite my young age, I found impossible to simply skim over. These pages discussed the dwelling places of sea birds; the 'solitary rocks and promontories' that were their only homes; the coast of Norway, dotted with islands from its southern point, Lindeness or the Naze, all the way to the North Cape\n'Where the Northern Ocean, in vast whirls,\nBoils round the naked, melancholy isles\nOf farthest Thule; and the Atlantic surge\nPours in among the stormy Hebrides.'\nEqually captivating was the description of the bleak shores of Lapland, Siberia, Spitzbergen, Nova Zembla, Iceland, and Greenland, with 'the vast sweep of the Arctic Zone, and those forlorn regions of dreary space,—that reservoir of frost and snow, where firm fields of ice, the accumulation of centuries of winters, glazed in Alpine heights above heights, surround the pole, and concentre the multiplied rigours of extreme cold.' I developed my own concept of these stark white territories—hazy, like the half-understood ideas that dimly drift through a child's mind, yet remarkably powerful. The words in these introductory pages connected with the pictures that followed, giving meaning to images like a single rock standing in a turbulent, misty sea, a broken boat abandoned on a desolate shore, or a cold, eerie moon visible through clouds over a sinking ship. I cannot explain the feeling evoked by the perfectly quiet, isolated churchyard, with its inscribed gravestone, gate, two trees, low horizon enclosed by a crumbling wall, and a new crescent moon signalling the evening hour. The image of the two ships motionless on a still sea felt like marine ghosts to me. I quickly turned past the depiction of a demon restraining a thief's pack; it was a frightening image. Equally terrifying was the black, horned figure sitting alone on a rock, watching a distant crowd gathered around a gallows. Each picture told a story, often mysterious to my developing intellect and emotions, but always deeply engaging; just as interesting as the stories Bessie sometimes shared on winter evenings when she was in a good mood, bringing her ironing board to the nursery fireplace, allowing us to gather around. While she starched Mrs. Reed's lace ruffles and crimped her nightcap borders, she captivated our eager attention with tales of love and adventure taken from old fairy stories and other ballads; or (as I later discovered) from the pages of Pamela and Henry, Earl of Moreland. With Bewick on my lap, I was happy then, or at least content in my own way. I only feared being disturbed, and unfortunately, that disturbance came too soon.",

Inside, I found a bookcase and soon picked out a book, choosing one rich with illustrations. I climbed into the window seat, tucked my feet beneath me and sat cross-legged, drawing the thick red curtain almost closed so that I was enclosed in a private cocoon. The folds of scarlet fabric blocked my view on one side, while on the other, glass panes revealed the gloomy November weather outside—rain swept the lawn and shrubs, mist and clouds loomed in the distance. Occasionally, as I flipped through my book, I gazed out at the dreary winter afternoon.\n\nMy book was Bewick’s History of British Birds. I usually ignored the words, but some of the introductory pages caught my attention, even as a child. These passages described the remote habitats of sea birds, the “solitary rocks and promontories” only they inhabited, and the wild shores of Norway stretching from its southern tip to the North Cape, as well as other desolate places like Lapland, Siberia, Spitzbergen, Nova Zembla, Iceland, and Greenland—landscapes of endless frost and snow and layers of ancient ice surrounding the pole. My mind conjured up my own vague but vivid image of these white, frozen lands—images that felt mysterious and powerful.\n\nThese descriptions matched up with the book’s pictures: solitary rocks amid stormy seas, a wrecked boat on a deserted shore, the cold moon shining through clouds as a ship sinks. The lonely churchyard, with its gravestone, gate, two trees, low horizon, crumbling wall, and new crescent moon at dusk, filled me with an undefined feeling. The two still ships on a calm sea seemed like ghostly visions. I skipped quickly over the frightening image of a demon pinning down a thief’s bundle, and the dark horned monster watching a gathering by a gallows was equally terrifying.\n\nEvery illustration seemed to hold a story, intriguing to me despite my limited understanding and mixed emotions—as fascinating as the stories Bessie sometimes shared on winter evenings, when she ironed by the nursery hearth and regaled us with tales of romance and adventure from old fairy tales, ballads, or as I later learned, from Pamela or Henry, Earl of Moreland.\n\nWith Bewick’s book on my lap, I felt happy in my own way.

He gorged himself habitually at table, which made him bilious, and gave him a dim and bleared eye and flabby cheeks. He ought now to have been at school; but his mama had taken him home for a month or two, “on account of his delicate health.” Mr. Miles, the master, affirmed that he would do very well if he had fewer cakes and sweetmeats sent him from home; but the mother’s heart turned from an opinion so harsh, and inclined rather to the more refined idea that John’s sallowness was owing to over-application and, perhaps, to pining after home.\nJohn had not much affection for his mother and sisters, and an antipathy to me. He bullied and punished me; not two or three times in the week, nor once or twice in the day, but continually: every nerve I had feared him, and every morsel of flesh in my bones shrank when he came near.

But Eliza just poked her head through the doorway and immediately announced, \"She's in the window seat, of course, Jack.\" I emerged right away, dreading the thought of being pulled out by him. \"What do you want?\" I asked, feeling shy and unsure. \"Say, 'What do you want, Master Reed?'\" was his reply. \"I want you to come here;\" then, sitting in an armchair, he gestured for me to approach and stand in front of him. John Reed was a fourteen-year-old schoolboy, four years my senior (I was only ten). He was large and sturdy for his age, with an unhealthy, sallow complexion.

John had little affection for his mother and sisters and a strong dislike for me. He constantly harassed and punished me, not just occasionally, but non-stop; I feared him with every part of my being, and my body tensed up whenever he was near. There were times I was paralyzed by the terror he caused, with absolutely no recourse against his threats or abuse; the servants were reluctant to displease their young master by supporting me, and Mrs. Reed chose to be completely oblivious to the situation: she never saw him hit me or heard him insult me, although he did both sometimes right in front of her, but more often when she wasn't watching.",

I was terrified of him at all times; every bit of me shrank away when he was near. Sometimes his threats and actions left me dizzy with fear, because there was no one to protect me—none of the servants dared confront the young master, and Mrs. Reed ignored it all: she never noticed when he hit or scolded me, even though it happened in front of her sometimes (it happened behind her back even more often)."

The fact is, I was a trifle beside myself; or rather out of myself, as the French would say: I was conscious that a moment’s mutiny had already rendered me liable to strange penalties, and, like any other rebel slave, I felt resolved, in my desperation, to go all lengths.\n“Hold her arms, Miss Abbot: she’s like a mad cat.”\n“For shame! for shame!” cried the lady’s-maid. “What shocking conduct, Miss Eyre, to strike a young gentleman, your benefactress’s son! Your young master.”\n“Master! How is he my master? Am I a servant?”\n“No; you are less than a servant, for you do nothing for your keep. There, sit down, and think over your wickedness.”\nThey had got me by this time into the apartment indicated by Mrs. Reed, and had thrust me upon a stool: my impulse was to rise from it like a spring; their two pair of hands arrested me instantly.\n“If you don’t sit still, you must be tied down,” said Bessie. “Miss Abbot, lend me your garters; she would break mine directly.”\nMiss Abbot turned to divest a stout leg of the necessary ligature. This preparation for bonds, and the additional ignominy it inferred, took a little of the excitement out of me.\n“Don’t take them off,” I cried; “I will not stir.”\nIn guarantee whereof, I attached myself to my seat by my hands.\n“Mind you don’t,” said Bessie; and when she had ascertained that I was really subsiding, she loosened her hold of me; then she and Miss Abbot stood with folded arms, looking darkly and doubtfully on my face, as incredulous of my sanity.\n“She never did so before,” at last said Bessie, turning to the Abigail.\n“But it was always in her,” was the reply. “I’ve told Missis often my opinion about the child, and Missis agreed with me. She’s an underhand little thing: I never saw a girl of her age with so much cover.”\nBessie answered not; but ere long, addressing me, she said—\n“You ought to be aware, Miss, that you are under obligations to Mrs. Reed: she keeps you: if she were to turn you off, you would have to go to the poorhouse.”\nI had nothing to say to these words: they were not new to me: my very first recollections of existence included hints of the same kind. This reproach of my dependence had become a vague sing-song in my ear: very painful and crushing, but only half intelligible. Miss Abbot joined in—\n“And you ought not to think yourself on an equality with the Misses Reed and Master Reed, because Missis kindly allows you to be brought up with them. They will have a great deal of money, and you will have none: it is your place to be humble, and to try to make yourself agreeable to them.”\n“What we tell you is for your good,” added Bessie, in no harsh voice, “you should try to be useful and pleasant, then, perhaps, you would have a home here; but if you become passionate and rude, Missis will send you away, I am sure.”\n“Besides,” said Miss Abbot, “God will punish her: He might strike her dead in the midst of her tantrums, and then where would she go? Come, Bessie, we will leave her: I wouldn’t have her heart for anything. Say your prayers, Miss Eyre, when you are by yourself; for if you don’t repent, something bad might be permitted to come down the chimney and fetch you away.”",
          "paraphrase_gemini-2.5-flash-preview-04-17": "I fought against them every step of the way, which was a new experience for me and significantly reinforced the poor opinion Bessie and Miss Abbot were ready to have of me. The fact is, I was slightly out of control; or rather, completely unlike myself, as the French phrase puts it. I was aware that a brief moment of rebellion had already made me vulnerable to severe consequences, and, like any other desperate slave resisting, I felt determined to go to any extreme. “Hold her arms, Miss Abbot; she’s like a wild cat,” one of them said. “For shame! For shame!” cried the lady’s maid. “What disgraceful behavior, Miss Eyre, to strike a young gentleman, the son of your benefactor! Your young master.” “Master! How is he my master? Am I a servant?” I challenged. “No,” she replied, “you are less than a servant, for you do nothing to earn your keep. There, sit down, and reflect on your wickedness.” By this time, they had managed to get me into the room Mrs. Reed had indicated and had pushed me onto a stool. My impulse was to spring up immediately, but their combined hands instantly held me down. “If you don’t stay still, you must be tied down,” Bessie declared. “Miss Abbot, lend me your garters; she would break mine right away.” Miss Abbot turned to remove the necessary band from her stout leg. This preparation for being bound, and the added disgrace it implied, took away some of my intense feeling. “Don’t take them off,” I cried; “I will not move.” To guarantee this, I gripped the seat with my hands. “Make sure you don’t,” said Bessie; and when she confirmed I was genuinely calming down, she released her hold on me. Then she and Miss Abbot stood with their arms folded, looking sternly and doubtfully at my face, as if questioning my sanity. “She never acted like this before,” Bessie finally said, turning to Miss Abbot. “But it was always inherent in her nature,” was the reply. “I’ve often told Mrs. Reed my thoughts about the child, and Mrs. Reed agreed with me. She’s a secretive little creature; I’ve never encountered a girl her age with so much hidden depth.” Bessie offered no immediate answer, but before long, addressing me, she said, “You ought to realize, Miss, that you are indebted to Mrs. Reed; she provides for you. If she were to dismiss you, you would have to go to the poorhouse.” I had nothing to say in response to these words; they were not new to me. My very earliest memories included similar suggestions. This accusation of my dependence had become a vague, painful, and crushing refrain in my ear, though only partially understandable. Miss Abbot added, “And you shouldn’t consider yourself equal to the Misses Reed and Master Reed, simply because Mrs. Reed is kind enough to allow you to be brought up with them. They will possess significant wealth, and you will have none; your place is to be humble and try to make yourself agreeable to them.” “What we are telling you is for your own good,” added Bessie, in a tone that was not harsh, “you should strive to be useful and pleasant; then, perhaps, you might have a home here; but if you become passionate and rude, Mrs. Reed will send you away, I am certain.” “Furthermore,” said Miss Abbot, “God will punish her; He might strike her dead in the midst of her tantrums, and then where would she go? Come, Bessie, we will leave her; I wouldn’t want her conscience for anything. Say your prayers, Miss Eyre, when you are alone, because if you don’t repent, something bad might be permitted to come down the chimney and take you away.”",
          "paraphrase_gpt-4.1-2025-04-14": "I resisted the whole time, something I had never done before, which made Bessie and Miss Abbot think even worse of me. Honestly, I was not myself; it felt as if I were in a frenzy, aware that my momentary rebellion would earn me harsh punishments, and like a desperate slave, I was ready to go to any extreme. \n\n“Hold her arms, Miss Abbot! She’s like a wild cat,” Bessie exclaimed. \n\n“For shame!” cried Miss Abbot. “Such terrible behavior, Miss Eyre, to strike your benefactress’s son. He’s your young master.”\n\n“Master? How is he my master? Am I a servant?”\n\n“No; you’re even less than that, since you do nothing to earn your keep. Now sit down and reflect on your wickedness.”\n\nBy now, they had dragged me to the room Mrs. Reed mentioned, forcing me onto a stool. I wanted to spring up, but their hands restrained me. \n\n“If you won’t stay still, we’ll have to tie you down,” Bessie said. “Miss Abbot, lend me your garters; she’d break mine.”\n\nMiss Abbot began to take them off, but the threat of being tied up, and the shame it brought, drained some of my anger.\n\n“Don’t take them off,” I pleaded, “I’ll stay put.”\n\nTo prove it, I gripped the seat tightly with my hands.\n\n“Be sure you do,” Bessie said, and, seeing I was calming down, released me. She and Miss Abbot then crossed their arms and stared at me, as if they doubted my sanity.\n\n“She’s never acted like this before,” Bessie eventually remarked.\n\n“But it was always within her,” Miss Abbot replied. “I’ve often told the mistress what I thought of the child, and she agrees. She’s a sly one; I’ve never seen a girl her age so secretive.”\n\nBessie didn’t answer, but soon addressed me directly: “You should remember, you owe Mrs. Reed everything. If she turned you out, you’d end up in the poorhouse.”\n\nI didn’t respond; I’d heard that accusation all my life, a refrain that was painful but had become almost meaningless. Miss Abbot added, “And you shouldn’t think you’re equal to the Reed children, simply because you’re raised with them. They’ll inherit wealth and you’ll have nothing. You should be humble and try to please them.”\n\n“It’s for your own good,” Bessie added more kindly. “If you’re helpful and pleasant, maybe you can stay; but if you’re angry and rude, the mistress will surely send you away.”\n\n“And besides,” Miss Abbot finished, “God will punish you. He could strike you dead in a tantrum, and where would you go then? Come, Bessie, let’s leave her. I wouldn’t want her heart. Pray, Miss Eyre, when you’re alone, or else something evil might come down the chimney and take you away.”"

A bed supported on massive pillars of mahogany, hung with curtains of deep red damask, stood out like a tabernacle in the centre; the two large windows, with their blinds always drawn down, were half shrouded in festoons and falls of similar drapery; the carpet was red; the table at the foot of the bed was covered with a crimson cloth; the walls were a soft fawn colour with a blush of pink in it; the wardrobe, the toilet-table, the chairs were of darkly polished old mahogany. Out of these deep surrounding shades rose high, and glared white, the piled-up mattresses and pillows of the bed, spread with a snowy Marseilles counterpane.

The red-room was a spacious, square chamber, very infrequently used for sleeping—in fact, almost never, unless an unusual number of guests at Gateshead Hall required the use of every available space. Despite this, it was one of the largest and most impressive rooms in the manor. A grand bed with substantial mahogany pillars, draped in deep red damask curtains, occupied the center like a shrine. The two large windows, with their blinds perpetually lowered, were partially obscured by swags and drapes of the same fabric. The floor was covered by a red carpet, and the table at the foot of the bed was draped in crimson cloth. The walls were a gentle fawn color with a hint of pink. The wardrobe, dressing table, and chairs were crafted from dark, gleaming old mahogany. Standing out against these dark surroundings were the high stack of white mattresses and pillows on the bed, covered by a bright white Marseilles bedspread. Almost as noticeable was a large, well-padded armchair near the head of the bed, also white, with a footstool in front of it, which I perceived as resembling a pale throne. This room felt cold because it was rarely warmed by a fire, quiet because of its distance from the nursery and kitchen, and solemn due to its known infrequent occupancy. Only the housemaid entered on Saturdays to dust the mirrors and furniture. Mrs. Reed herself occasionally visited to access a particular hidden drawer in the wardrobe containing various papers, her jewelry box, and a miniature of her late husband. In these last items lies the reason the red-room remained so solitary despite its magnificence—it was linked to the memory of her deceased husband.

That last item held the room’s true secret—that it remained uninhabited and somber despite its splendor.\n\nMr. Reed had been dead for nine years. This was the chamber where he died; where his body was laid out; and from where his coffin was carried away by undertakers. Since that day, a melancholy sense of sanctity had kept the room mostly unused."

Uncertain if the door was secured, I cautiously rose and checked; tragically, it was locked as firmly as any prison.

The peculiar small figure staring back at me, with its pale face and arms distinct against the darkness and fearful, flickering eyes within an otherwise motionless form, appeared genuinely spectral.

Why was I always suffering, always browbeaten, always accused, for ever condemned? Why could I never please? Why was it useless to try to win any one’s favour? Eliza, who was headstrong and selfish, was respected. Georgiana, who had a spoiled temper, a very acrid spite, a captious and insolent carriage, was universally indulged. Her beauty, her pink cheeks and golden curls, seemed to give delight to all who looked at her, and to purchase indemnity for every fault. John no one thwarted, much less punished; though he twisted the necks of the pigeons, killed the little pea-chicks, set the dogs at the sheep, stripped the hothouse vines of their fruit, and broke the buds off the choicest plants in the conservatory: he called his mother “old girl,” too; sometimes reviled her for her dark skin, similar to his own; bluntly disregarded her wishes; not unfrequently tore and spoiled her silk attire; and he was still “her own darling.” I dared commit no fault: I strove to fulfil every duty; and I was termed naughty and tiresome, sullen and sneaking, from morning to noon, and from noon to night.\nMy head still ached and bled with the blow and fall I had received: no one had reproved John for wantonly striking me; and because I had turned against him to avert farther irrational violence, I was loaded with general opprobrium.\n“Unjust!—unjust!” said my reason, forced by the agonising stimulus into precocious though transitory power: and Resolve, equally wrought up, instigated some strange expedient to achieve escape from insupportable oppression—as running away, or, if that could not be effected, never eating or drinking more, and letting myself die.\nWhat a consternation of soul was mine that dreary afternoon! How all my brain was in tumult, and all my heart in insurrection! Yet in what darkness, what dense ignorance, was the mental battle fought! I could not answer the ceaseless inward question—why I thus suffered; now, at the distance of—I will not say how many years, I see it clearly.\nI was a discord in Gateshead Hall: I was like nobody there; I had nothing in harmony with Mrs. Reed or her children, or her chosen vassalage. If they did not love me, in fact, as little did I love them. They were not bound to regard with affection a thing that could not sympathise with one amongst them; a heterogeneous thing, opposed to them in temperament, in capacity, in propensities; a useless thing, incapable of serving their interest, or adding to their pleasure; a noxious thing, cherishing the germs of indignation at their treatment, of contempt of their judgment. I know that had I been a sanguine, brilliant, careless, exacting, handsome, romping child—though equally dependent and friendless—Mrs. Reed would have endured my presence more complacently; her children would have entertained for me more of the cordiality of fellow-feeling; the servants would have been less prone to make me the scapegoat of the nursery.",
          "paraphrase_gemini-2.5-flash-preview-04-17": "At that specific moment, a sense of fear or superstition began to creep in, though it hadn't fully overwhelmed me yet. My spirit was still strong, like that of a rebellious slave, giving me sharp, bracing energy. I had to fight off a quick surge of memories about the past before I could fully yield to the bleakness of the present situation. All the harsh oppression from John Reed, his sisters' arrogant lack of concern, his mother's dislike, and the servants' unfair favouritism surfaced in my troubled mind like dark sediment stirred up in murky water. I wondered why I was constantly suffering, always being bossed around, endlessly accused, and perpetually judged. Why could I never please anyone? Why was it pointless to try and win anyone's approval? Eliza, who was stubborn and selfish, was treated with respect. Georgiana, who had a bad temper, intense spitefulness, and a critical, rude attitude, was always indulged. Her beauty, her rosy cheeks and golden curls, seemed to delight everyone who saw her and protected her from consequences for any mistake. No one opposed John, much less punished him, even though he killed pigeons, little pea-chicks, sicked dogs on sheep, stripped the fruit from hothouse vines, and broke buds off the best plants in the conservatory. He even called his mother names like \"old girl,\" sometimes mocked her for her dark skin which resembled his own, openly ignored her wishes, and often tore or ruined her silk clothes; yet, he remained \"her own darling.\" I dared not make any mistakes; I tried my best to fulfill every duty, and despite this, I was called naughty and tiresome, sullen and secretive, from morning until night. My head still hurt and was bleeding from the blow and the fall I had experienced. No one had reprimanded John for senselessly hitting me; and because I had defended myself against him to prevent further unreasonable violence, I was universally condemned. \"Unfair!—unfair!\" my reason cried out, pushed by the intense pain into a sharp, albeit temporary, moment of clarity. This strong feeling also prompted me to come up with some drastic plan for escaping the unbearable oppression, such as running away, or if that wasn't possible, stopping eating and drinking and letting myself die. What extreme confusion and distress my soul was in during that miserable afternoon! How my mind was in turmoil and my heart in revolt! Yet, the internal struggle was fought in such ignorance and lack of understanding! I couldn't answer the persistent inner question about why I was suffering like this. Now, many years later, I understand it clearly. I was an outsider at Gateshead Hall; I didn't fit in with anyone there. I had nothing in common with Mrs. Reed, her children, or the staff she preferred. Just as they didn't love me, I felt little love for them. They weren't obligated to feel affection for someone who couldn't connect with any of them—someone fundamentally different in temperament, ability, and inclinations; someone they saw as useless, incapable of benefiting them or adding to their happiness; even someone harmful, harboring seeds of anger at how they treated her and contempt for their judgment. I know that if I had been a cheerful, lively, carefree, demanding, attractive, playful child—even if still dependent and friendless—Mrs. Reed would have tolerated my presence more easily; her children would have felt more camaraderie towards me; and the servants would have been less likely to make me the scapegoat in the nursery.",
          "paraphrase_gpt-4.1-2025-04-14": "At that moment, superstition affected me, but it hadn’t completely overcome me yet: I still felt strong, fueled by the defiant spirit of someone who refuses subjugation; I had to fight back a flood of memories before I gave in to the misery of my current situation. All of John Reed’s cruelty, his sisters’ haughty coldness, his mother’s dislike, and the servants’ bias resurfaced in my troubled thoughts, like muck rising in a cloudy well. Why was I always the one punished, mistreated, and blamed? Why couldn’t I ever make anyone happy? Why was trying to gain favor always fruitless? Eliza, headstrong and selfish, was respected; Georgiana, spoiled and spiteful, was always indulged because her beauty charmed everyone and seemed to excuse her every fault. John, whose behavior was far worse—hurting animals, damaging property, insulting his mother—was never challenged or punished; in fact, he remained his mother’s favorite. Meanwhile, I, who tried hard to do what was right, was called bad and tiresome all the time. My head still throbbed from the blow I’d received from John, yet nobody scolded him for hitting me unprovoked; instead, because I defended myself, I was attacked by everyone. My sense of justice cried out that this was unfair, and in my desperation, I considered desperate means to escape—running away, or even refusing food and drink until I died. That bleak afternoon, my inner turmoil was immense—my mind in chaos, my heart in rebellion—yet I struggled in darkness, not understanding why I suffered so much. Only years later did I realize the truth: I was an outsider in Gateshead Hall, fundamentally different from the Reeds and their servants. They didn’t love me, but I didn’t love them either. Why would they care for someone so unlike themselves, who could do nothing to further their interests or bring them joy, and who resented their treatment? If I had been a lively, attractive, easygoing child, even as dependent and lonely, Mrs. Reed and her children might have tolerated me better, and the servants might not have blamed me for every mishap."

I heard the rain still beating continuously on the staircase window, and the wind howling in the grove behind the hall; I grew by degrees cold as a stone, and then my courage sank. My habitual mood of humiliation, self-doubt, forlorn depression, fell damp on the embers of my decaying ire. All said I was wicked, and perhaps I might be so; what thought had I been but just conceiving of starving myself to death? That certainly was a crime: and was I fit to die? Or was the vault under the chancel of Gateshead Church an inviting bourne? In such vault I had been told did Mr. Reed lie buried; and led by this thought to recall his idea, I dwelt on it with gathering dread. I could not remember him; but I knew that he was my own uncle—my mother’s brother—that he had taken me when a parentless infant to his house; and that in his last moments he had required a promise of Mrs. Reed that she would rear and maintain me as one of her own children. Mrs. Reed probably considered she had kept this promise; and so she had, I dare say, as well as her nature would permit her; but how could she really like an interloper not of her race, and unconnected with her, after her husband’s death, by any tie? It must have been most irksome to find herself bound by a hard-wrung pledge to stand in the stead of a parent to a strange child she could not love, and to see an uncongenial alien permanently intruded on her own family group.\nA singular notion dawned upon me. I doubted not—never doubted—that if Mr. Reed had been alive he would have treated me kindly; and now, as I sat looking at the white bed and overshadowed walls—occasionally also turning a fascinated eye towards the dimly gleaming mirror—I began to recall what I had heard of dead men, troubled in their graves by the violation of their last wishes, revisiting the earth to punish the perjured and avenge the oppressed; and I thought Mr. Reed’s spirit, harassed by the wrongs of his sister’s child, might quit its abode—whether in the church vault or in the unknown world of the departed—and rise before me in this chamber. I wiped my tears and hushed my sobs, fearful lest any sign of violent grief might waken a preternatural voice to comfort me, or elicit from the gloom some haloed face, bending over me with strange pity. This idea, consolatory in theory, I felt would be terrible if realised: with all my might I endeavoured to stifle it—I endeavoured to be firm.",

Gradually, I felt myself turn as cold as stone, and my bravery disappeared. My usual feelings of being put down, unsure of myself, and sadly depressed washed over the faint remnants of my anger. Everyone said I was bad, and maybe I was; just a moment ago, I was thinking about starving myself to death. That was definitely a sin, and was I ready to die? Was the tomb under the altar area of Gateshead Church a desirable destination? I'd been told Mr. Reed was buried there. Thinking of this made me remember him, and thinking about him filled me with increasing fear. I couldn't remember what he looked like, but I knew he was my uncle, my mother's brother, who had taken me into his home as a baby with no parents. I knew that before he died, he had made Mrs. Reed promise to raise and support me as one of her own kids. Mrs. Reed probably believed she had kept this promise, and to be fair, I guess she did as well as she possibly could given her personality. But how could she truly like an outsider, not related to her family, and with no connection to her after her husband's death? It must have been incredibly difficult for her to feel obligated by a promise she didn't want to make, having to act like a mother to a strange child she couldn't love, and seeing someone she didn't get along with constantly forced into her family life.\nA strange idea came into my mind. I was certain, always certain, that if Mr. Reed were alive, he would have treated me well. Now, sitting and looking at the white bed and the dark walls, sometimes glancing with fascination at the dimly lit mirror, I started remembering stories about dead people disturbed in their graves when their final wishes weren't followed. They supposedly returned to Earth to punish those who broke their promises and help those who were wronged. I thought maybe Mr. Reed's ghost, upset by how his sister's child was being treated, might leave its resting place—whether in the church tomb or the unknown world of the dead—and appear before me in this room. I dried my tears and quieted my crying, afraid that showing such strong sorrow might call up a supernatural voice to comfort me, or reveal a glowing face from the darkness, leaning over me with strange pity. While this idea seemed comforting in theory, I felt it would be terrifying if it actually happened. I tried my hardest to stop thinking about it; I tried to be strong.",

Was the burial vault at Gateshead Church—where I'd been told Mr. Reed was buried—a place I wanted to go? Remembering this, I contemplated Mr. Reed. Though I couldn't recall him personally, I knew he was my uncle who'd taken me in as a baby after my parents died. He’d made Mrs. Reed promise to raise me as her own child. She probably believed she'd kept her word as far as she could, but how could she truly care for someone unrelated to her, especially after her husband’s death? It must have been hard for her to feel obligated to care for a child she couldn't love, always having a foreign presence among her family. A strange thought occurred to me: I never doubted Mr. Reed would have been kind if he’d lived. While looking at the white bed and shadowy walls, sometimes glimpsing at the dim mirror, I recalled stories of unsettled spirits returning to punish those who broke their dying wishes. I wondered if Mr. Reed’s spirit, troubled by my mistreatment, might appear in this room. I wiped away my tears and tried to stifle my sobs, afraid that any show of grief might summon something supernatural—a comforting voice or a pitying face from the gloom.

I can now conjecture readily that this streak of light was, in all likelihood, a gleam from a lantern carried by some one across the lawn: but then, prepared as my mind was for horror, shaken as my nerves were by agitation, I thought the swift darting beam was a herald of some coming vision from another world. My heart beat thick, my head grew hot; a sound filled my ears, which I deemed the rushing of wings; something seemed near me; I was oppressed, suffocated: endurance broke down; I rushed to the door and shook the lock in desperate effort.

No, moonlight is steady, and this light moved; as I watched, it slid upwards towards the ceiling and trembled above me. Now, I can easily guess that this line of light was probably from a lantern someone was carrying across the grass. However, at that moment, with my mind primed for terror and my nerves jangled by fear, I believed the rapidly moving beam was a sign of a supernatural appearance from another realm. My pulse quickened dramatically, my head felt hot, and my ears buzzed with a sound I imagined were beating wings. Something felt close by; I felt overwhelmed and unable to breathe. My self-control failed; I sprinted to the door and rattled the lock in a frantic attempt to get out. Footsteps hurried down the hallway outside; the key turned, and Bessie and Abbot came in.",

As I watched, the beam slid up to the ceiling and trembled above me. Looking back now, I realize it was probably the light of a lantern as someone walked across the lawn. But at the time, my fearful mind and unsettled nerves made me believe it was the sign of a supernatural apparition.

Abbot, however, dismissed my distress, accusing me of screaming deliberately just to get everyone's attention and calling it one of my usual misbehaviors. Suddenly, Mrs. Reed appeared, demanding to know what was happening, her presence marked by her disheveled cap and rustling gown. Reminding Abbot and Bessie of her instructions to keep me in the red-room, Mrs. Reed dismissed Bessie's attempt at defending me and ordered her to let go of my hand, saying that such tricks would not work and that I needed to learn this lesson. She decreed that I would stay in the room for an additional hour and would only be released if I behaved perfectly in the meantime. I pleaded desperately for forgiveness and begged for a different punishment, fearing that staying would be unbearable. Mrs. Reed cut me off sternly, calling my behavior repulsive and viewing me as deceitful and troublesome.

Turning from Bessie (though her presence was far less obnoxious to me than that of Abbot, for instance, would have been), I scrutinised the face of the gentleman: I knew him; it was Mr. Lloyd, an apothecary, sometimes called in by Mrs. Reed when the servants were ailing: for herself and the children she employed a physician.\n“Well, who am I?” he asked.\nI pronounced his name, offering him at the same time my hand: he took it, smiling and saying, “We shall do very well by-and-by.” Then he laid me down, and addressing Bessie, charged her to be very careful that I was not disturbed during the night.

Turning my attention from Bessie (whose presence bothered me far less than, say, Abbot's would have), I carefully observed the gentleman's face; I recognized him. It was Mr. Lloyd, an apothecary Mrs. Reed sometimes called upon when the servants were ill; for herself and the children, she used a different physician. 'Alright, who am I?' he asked. I stated his name and offered him my hand simultaneously; he accepted it, smiling and saying, 'We will be perfectly fine in a while.' Then he laid me back down and told Bessie to ensure I was absolutely not disturbed during the night. After providing some further instructions and indicating he would return the following day, he left, much to my dismay.

I answered his name and shook his hand, which he accepted while smiling and reassuring me that things would soon be better.

'In that case, I believe I will retire to bed, as it is now after midnight; however, please feel free to summon me if you require anything during the night.' This display of remarkable politeness was surprising and encouraged me to venture a question. 'Bessie,' I asked, 'what is wrong with me? Am I unwell?' 'You became ill, I presume, from weeping so much in the red room,' she explained, 'you will undoubtedly recover shortly.' Bessie then moved to the housemaid's adjacent room. I overheard her saying, 'Sarah, come and share the nursery bed with me; I absolutely cannot be alone with that poor girl tonight: she could potentially pass away; it was so peculiar that she had that seizure: I can't help but wonder if she witnessed something. The mistress was quite harsh on her.' Sarah returned alongside her; they both settled into bed; they continued whispering to each other for about thirty minutes before finally drifting off. I managed to overhear fragments of their discussion, and from these, I could infer the primary topic being talked about with unfortunate clarity. The snippets included phrases like—'Something went past her, clad entirely in white, and disappeared'—'A large black dog following him'—'Three distinct knocks on the bedroom door'—'A light in the graveyard right above his burial spot,' and other similar remarks.

Her kindness encouraged me to ask her what was wrong with me and if I was ill. She replied that I had likely made myself sick crying in the red-room, but would soon recover. Afterward, Bessie went to the housemaid’s room nearby and asked Sarah to sleep in the nursery with her because she was too scared to be alone with me, worried that something might happen to me in the night. Bessie wondered aloud about the strange fit I had and suggested perhaps I had seen something unusual; she also thought her mistress had been too harsh. Sarah agreed to stay with her. The two of them talked in hushed voices for half an hour before falling asleep, and from the pieces of their conversation I could tell they were discussing supernatural or frightening things they thought I might have experienced: someone dressed in white disappearing, a black dog, loud knocks on the door, a mysterious light in a graveyard, and other such stories. Eventually, they both fell asleep, and the fire and candle went out.

Mrs. Reed, you caused me intense emotional pain, but I ought to forgive you, because you didn’t understand the effects of your actions: when you broke my spirit, you thought you were only correcting my faults. The day after, I got up around noon, dressed, and sat by the nursery fire wrapped in a shawl. Though my body was weak and exhausted, my greatest suffering was a profound misery that made me cry quietly; each tear I wiped away was quickly replaced by another. Oddly, I thought I should have felt content, because the Reed family was out and I was alone, with Abbot in another room and Bessie treating me with unusual kindness as she worked. This should have seemed like a peaceful haven to someone used to constant scolding and thankless chores, but in reality, my nerves were so strained that nothing could comfort or please me."

This precious vessel was now placed on my knee, and I was cordially invited to eat the circlet of delicate pastry upon it. Vain favour! coming, like most other favours long deferred and often wished for, too late! I could not eat the tart; and the plumage of the bird, the tints of the flowers, seemed strangely faded: I put both plate and tart away. Bessie asked if I would have a book: the word book acted as a transient stimulus, and I begged her to fetch Gulliver’s Travels from the library. This book I had again and again perused with delight. I considered it a narrative of facts, and discovered in it a vein of interest deeper than what I found in fairy tales: for as to the elves, having sought them in vain among foxglove leaves and bells, under mushrooms and beneath the ground-ivy mantling old wall-nooks, I had at length made up my mind to the sad truth, that they were all gone out of England to some savage country where the woods were wilder and thicker, and the population more scant; whereas, Lilliput and Brobdignag being, in my creed, solid parts of the earth’s surface, I doubted not that I might one day, by taking a long voyage, see with my own eyes the little fields, houses, and trees, the diminutive people, the tiny cows, sheep, and birds of the one realm; and the corn-fields forest-high, the mighty mastiffs, the monster cats, the tower-like men and women, of the other. Yet, when this cherished volume was now placed in my hand—when I turned over its leaves, and sought in its marvellous pictures the charm I had, till now, never failed to find—all was eerie and dreary; the giants were gaunt goblins, the pigmies malevolent and fearful imps, Gulliver a most desolate wanderer in most dread and dangerous regions. I closed the book, which I dared no longer peruse, and put it on the table, beside the untasted tart.",

This plate featured a bird of paradise nestled among morning glories and rosebuds, a design that used to inspire great admiration in me. I had often asked if I could hold the plate myself to look at it closely, but until now, I had never been thought worthy of such a privilege. This treasured plate was now placed on my lap, and I was kindly told to eat the small, tender pastry on it. What an empty gesture! Like many long-delayed and much-desired favors, it arrived too late! I couldn't bring myself to eat the tart; even the bird's feathers and the flowers' colors seemed strangely dull. I pushed both the plate and the tart away. Bessie asked if I wanted a book; the word 'book' stirred a brief flicker of interest, and I asked her to get 'Gulliver's Travels' from the library. I had read this book many times before with great enjoyment. I saw it as a factual account and found it more profoundly interesting than fairy tales. This was because, after searching for elves in vain among foxgloves, under mushrooms, and in ivy-covered old walls, I had sadly concluded that they had all left England for some wilder, thicker-forested, and less populated land. In contrast, I truly believed Lilliput and Brobdingnag were real places on Earth and was sure that one day, after a long journey, I could personally see the tiny fields, houses, trees, people, cows, sheep, and birds of Lilliput, and the giant cornfields, huge dogs, enormous cats, and towering men and women of Brobdingnag. However, when this favorite book was now put into my hands—when I turned its pages and looked at its wonderful illustrations hoping to find the magic I had always found before—everything felt unsettling and miserable. The giants appeared as gaunt monsters, the little people seemed spiteful and terrifying demons, and Gulliver was simply a lonely wanderer in truly frightening and dangerous places. I closed the book, unable to read it further, and set it on the table next to the tart I had not eaten.",

The cherished plate was set on my lap, and I was warmly encouraged to eat the delicate pastry. Yet this kindness, long anticipated but now finally granted, was wasted, for it arrived too late—I had no appetite for the tart, and the colors on the plate’s bird and flowers seemed dull and lifeless to me. Disheartened, I set both the plate and the tart aside. Bessie then offered to bring me a book, and hearing the word \"book\" briefly lifted my spirits. I asked her to fetch 'Gulliver’s Travels,' a favorite of mine, which I always read with eagerness, believing its stories to be true facts. It fascinated me more deeply than fairy tales, since I had searched in vain for elves in gardens and woods, and sadly concluded that they must have left England altogether. However, I was convinced that Lilliput and Brobdingnag were actual places I might visit one day and see their wonders for myself. Yet now, when Bessie placed the beloved book in my hands and I looked at its familiar pictures, I no longer found their old enchantment; the giants appeared as frightening monsters, the little people as threatening creatures, and Gulliver as a lonely figure in ominous places. I set aside the book, unwilling to read further, and put it on the table next to the untouched tart."

But now, though her voice was still sweet, I found in its melody an indescribable sadness. Sometimes, preoccupied with her work, she sang the refrain very low, very lingeringly; “A long time ago” came out like the saddest cadence of a funeral hymn. She passed into another ballad, this time a really doleful one.\n“My feet they are sore, and my limbs they are weary;\n    Long is the way, and the mountains are wild;\nSoon will the twilight close moonless and dreary\n    Over the path of the poor orphan child.\n\nWhy did they send me so far and so lonely,\n    Up where the moors spread and grey rocks are piled?\nMen are hard-hearted, and kind angels only\n    Watch o’er the steps of a poor orphan child.\n\nYet distant and soft the night breeze is blowing,\n    Clouds there are none, and clear stars beam mild,\nGod, in His mercy, protection is showing,\n    Comfort and hope to the poor orphan child.\n\nEv’n should I fall o’er the broken bridge passing,\n    Or stray in the marshes, by false lights beguiled,\nStill will my Father, with promise and blessing,\n    Take to His bosom the poor orphan child.\n\nThere is a thought that for strength should avail me,\n    Though both of shelter and kindred despoiled;\nHeaven is a home, and a rest will not fail me;\n    God is a friend to the poor orphan child.”\n“Come, Miss Jane, don’t cry,” said Bessie as she finished.",

I had heard this song many times before and always found it quite enjoyable because Bessie had a pleasant voice, or at least, I believed she did. However, on this occasion, despite her voice remaining sweet, I detected an undefinable sorrow in the tune. At times, engrossed in her task, she would sing the concluding part, 'A long time ago,' softly and slowly, making it sound as mournful as a funeral dirge.

          "paraphrase_gpt-4.1-2025-04-14": "Mr. Lloyd continued his questions once Bessie had left, asking what had truly made me unwell if the fall hadn't been the cause. I explained that I had been locked in a room rumored to be haunted until after it was dark. Mr. Lloyd reacted with a mix of amusement and disapproval, questioning whether I was still just a child afraid of ghosts. I admitted that I was frightened of Mr. Reed's ghost, since he had died and was laid out in that room. I added that no one liked to enter the room at night, and being shut there alone without any light was so harsh that I felt I would never be able to forget it. Mr. Lloyd dismissed my fears as nonsense and asked if that was truly why I was so upset, wondering if I was still afraid during the day. I said I wasn’t, but I knew night would come again soon, and there were other reasons for my unhappiness as well. He encouraged me to share what else was troubling me. I wished to explain fully, but found it challenging, as children often feel deeply without understanding or being able to express their feelings clearly. Not wanting to waste the chance to lighten my sadness, I managed, after some hesitation, to give a brief but truthful answer: one reason was that I had no parents or siblings. Mr. Lloyd pointed out that I had a caring aunt and cousins, but I hesitated again before saying, awkwardly, that John Reed had knocked me down and my aunt had locked me in the red-room."

Mr. Lloyd suggested I might leave sooner, asking, \"Perhaps you may—who knows? Have you any relations besides Mrs. Reed?\" I said I didn't think so.

My reply was, \"No; I should not like to belong to poor people.\" Mr. Lloyd pressed, \"Not even if they were kind to you?\" I shook my head. I couldn't see how poor people could afford to be kind, and the thought of learning to speak like them, adopting their habits, being uneducated, and growing up like the poor women I sometimes saw in Gateshead village nursing their children or washing clothes outside their cottages was repellent.

She boasted of beautiful paintings of landscapes and flowers by them executed; of songs they could sing and pieces they could play, of purses they could net, of French books they could translate; till my spirit was moved to emulation as I listened. Besides, school would be a complete change: it implied a long journey, an entire separation from Gateshead, an entrance into a new life.\n“I should indeed like to go to school,” was the audible conclusion of my musings.\n“Well, well! who knows what may happen?” said Mr. Lloyd, as he got up. “The child ought to have change of air and scene,” he added, speaking to himself; “nerves not in a good state.”\nBessie now returned; at the same moment the carriage was heard rolling up the gravel-walk.\n“Is that your mistress, nurse?” asked Mr. Lloyd. “I should like to speak to her before I go.”\nBessie invited him to walk into the breakfast-room, and led the way out. In the interview which followed between him and Mrs. Reed, I presume, from after-occurrences, that the apothecary ventured to recommend my being sent to school; and the recommendation was no doubt readily enough adopted; for as Abbot said, in discussing the subject with Bessie when both sat sewing in the nursery one night, after I was in bed, and, as they thought, asleep, “Missis was, she dared say, glad enough to get rid of such a tiresome, ill-conditioned child, who always looked as if she were watching everybody, and scheming plots underhand.” Abbot, I think, gave me credit for being a sort of infantine Guy Fawkes.",
          "paraphrase_gemini-2.5-flash-preview-04-17": "Mr. Lloyd asked if my relatives were very poor and if they worked. I replied I didn't know, but Aunt Reed believed they must be a poor group, and I wouldn't want to have to beg. Then he asked if I would like to go to school. I paused to think; I had little idea what school was like. Bessie's descriptions varied: sometimes she said it was a place where girls were put in stocks, wore posture boards, and had to be extremely proper and refined. John Reed hated his school and his teacher, but his preferences didn't apply to me. While Bessie's accounts of school discipline (from young ladies in a previous household) sounded rather dreadful, her descriptions of their achievements were, I thought, equally appealing. She praised the beautiful landscape and flower paintings they created, the songs they sang, the music they played, the purses they knitted, and the French books they translated. Listening to her, I felt inspired to achieve similar things. Additionally, school offered a complete change: it meant a long trip, being entirely away from Gateshead, and starting a new life. \"I would indeed like to go to school,\" I said, vocalizing my thoughts. \"Well, well! You never know what might happen,\" Mr. Lloyd said, standing up. He added, speaking to himself, \"The child needs a change of air and surroundings; her nerves are not in good condition.\" Bessie returned just as the carriage was heard pulling up the gravel drive. \"Is that your mistress, Nurse?\" Mr. Lloyd asked. \"I would like to speak to her before I leave.\" Bessie invited him into the breakfast room and led the way. From subsequent events, I assume that during their conversation, the apothecary suggested sending me to school, and this advice was undoubtedly accepted quite readily. This is confirmed by a later discussion between Abbot and Bessie while they were sewing in the nursery one evening after I was in bed and they thought I was asleep. Abbot remarked that \"Mistress was,\" she was sure, \"glad enough to be rid of such a difficult, troublesome child who always seemed to be watching everyone and secretly planning things.\" I believe Abbot saw me as a kind of scheming infant.",

I surely would hate to have to beg.\"\n\"Would you like to go to school?\"\nI thought about it again. I barely understood what school was—Bessie sometimes described it as a place where young girls had to sit in uncomfortable positions, wear stiff posture-correctors, and behave in a very proper and perfect way. John Reed hated his school and always complained about his teacher. But I didn't think his opinion should influence my own, and, while Bessie’s descriptions of strict discipline in schools (which she’d heard from girls where she used to work) were a little frightening, she also talked about the impressive skills these girls learned. She told me about lovely pictures they painted, the songs they sang, their ability to play music, knit purses, and read French books; hearing all this made me want to learn too. Also, school would be a big change: it would mean traveling far, leaving Gateshead behind, and starting a new life.\n\"I would really like to go to school,\" I finally said out loud.\n\"Well, well, who knows what might happen?\" Mr. Lloyd said as he stood up. Then, to himself, he added, \"The child really needs a change of environment; her nerves aren't in good condition.\"\nBessie came back just then, and at the same moment, we heard the carriage arriving outside.\n\"Is that your mistress, nurse?\" Mr. Lloyd asked. \"I’d like to speak with her before I leave.\"\nBessie showed him into the breakfast-room and led the way out.

Mrs. Reed surveyed me at times with a severe eye, but seldom addressed me: since my illness, she had drawn a more marked line of separation than ever between me and her own children; appointing me a small closet to sleep in by myself, condemning me to take my meals alone, and pass all my time in the nursery, while my cousins were constantly in the drawing-room. Not a hint, however, did she drop about sending me to school: still I felt an instinctive certainty that she would not long endure me under the same roof with her; for her glance, now more than ever, when turned on me, expressed an insuperable and rooted aversion.\nEliza and Georgiana, evidently acting according to orders, spoke to me as little as possible: John thrust his tongue in his cheek whenever he saw me, and once attempted chastisement; but as I instantly turned against him, roused by the same sentiment of deep ire and desperate revolt which had stirred my corruption before, he thought it better to desist, and ran from me uttering execrations, and vowing I had burst his nose.

I heard him in a blubbering tone commence the tale of how “that nasty Jane Eyre” had flown at him like a mad cat: he was stopped rather harshly—\n“Don’t talk to me about her, John: I told you not to go near her; she is not worthy of notice; I do not choose that either you or your sisters should associate with her.”\nHere, leaning over the banister, I cried out suddenly, and without at all deliberating on my words—\n“They are not fit to associate with me.”\nMrs. Reed was rather a stout woman; but, on hearing this strange and audacious declaration, she ran nimbly up the stair, swept me like a whirlwind into the nursery, and crushing me down on the edge of my crib, dared me in an emphatic voice to rise from that place, or utter one syllable during the remainder of the day.\n“What would Uncle Reed say to you, if he were alive?” was my scarcely voluntary demand. I say scarcely voluntary, for it seemed as if my tongue pronounced words without my will consenting to their utterance: something spoke out of me over which I had no control.\n“What?” said Mrs. Reed under her breath: her usually cold composed grey eye became troubled with a look like fear; she took her hand from my arm, and gazed at me as if she really did not know whether I were child or fiend. I was now in for it.\n“My Uncle Reed is in heaven, and can see all you do and think; and so can papa and mama: they know how you shut me up all day long, and how you wish me dead.”\nMrs. Reed soon rallied her spirits: she shook me most soundly, she boxed both my ears, and then left me without a word. Bessie supplied the hiatus by a homily of an hour’s length, in which she proved beyond a doubt that I was the most wicked and abandoned child ever reared under a roof. I half believed her; for I felt indeed only bad feelings surging in my breast.",
          "paraphrase_gemini-2.5-flash-preview-04-17": "From my conversation with Mr. Lloyd and the overheard discussion between Bessie and Abbot, I found sufficient hope to fuel my desire for recovery: it seemed a change was imminent, and I silently longed and waited for it. However, it didn't happen quickly; days and weeks went by. I regained my health, but no further mention was made of the topic I kept thinking about. Mrs. Reed sometimes looked at me sternly but rarely spoke to me. Since my illness, she had created an even greater distance between me and her own children than before, assigning me a small, separate closet to sleep in, making me eat meals alone, and confining me to the nursery at all times, while my cousins were always in the drawing-room. Yet, she never mentioned sending me to school. Still, I had an intuitive certainty that she wouldn't keep me living under the same roof for much longer, as her gaze, now more than ever when it met mine, clearly showed an unconquerable and deep-seated dislike. Eliza and Georgiana, following instructions, spoke to me as little as possible. John stuck his tongue out at me whenever he saw me, and once tried to hit me. But because I immediately fought back, driven by the same intense anger and desperate urge to rebel that had provoked me before, he decided it was better to stop and ran away cursing and claiming I had broken his nose. I had indeed aimed a punch at that prominent feature as hard as my knuckles could manage. When I saw that either that blow or my expression scared him, I strongly wanted to press my advantage further, but he had already reached his mother. I heard him start telling her, sobbing, how \"that horrible Jane Eyre\" had attacked him like a wild cat. She interrupted him quite harshly: \"Don't talk to me about her, John. I told you not to go near her; she's not worth paying attention to. I don't want you or your sisters associating with her.\" At this point, leaning over the banister, I suddenly shouted out, without stopping to think about my words at all: \"They are not good enough to be with me.\" Mrs. Reed was a rather large woman, but upon hearing this strange and bold statement, she quickly ran up the stairs, swept me into the nursery like a tornado, pushed me forcefully down onto the edge of my crib, and dared me in a firm voice not to get up or say another word for the rest of the day. \"What would Uncle Reed say to you if he were alive?\" was the question I asked, almost without meaning to. I say 'scarcely voluntary' because it felt as though my tongue was speaking words without my will agreeing to them; something spoke out of me that I couldn't control. \"What?\" Mrs. Reed said quietly. Her usually calm, composed grey eyes looked troubled, showing something like fear. She took her hand off my arm and stared at me as if she genuinely didn't know if I was a child or a demon. Now I was really in trouble. \"My Uncle Reed is in heaven and can see everything you do and think, and so can papa and mama. They know how you keep me locked up all day and how you wish I were dead.\" Mrs. Reed quickly regained her composure. She shook me very hard, hit both my ears, and then left me without a word. Bessie filled the silence with a lecture that lasted for an hour, during which she conclusively proved that I was the most wicked and abandoned child ever raised under a roof. I partly believed her, because I honestly felt only bad emotions swelling within me.",
          "paraphrase_gpt-4.1-2025-04-14": "From my conversations with Mr. Lloyd and from listening to Bessie and Abbot's earlier discussion, I gathered enough reason to hope for a change in my situation, which motivated me to recover from my illness. I waited quietly for this change to happen, feeling it might be near, but as time went by—days and weeks—I got better physically, yet nothing new was said about the matter that constantly occupied my thoughts. Mrs. Reed would sometimes look at me harshly but rarely spoke to me. Since my recent illness, she separated me even more from her children—giving me a small room to sleep in alone, forcing me to eat by myself and spend all my time in the nursery, while my cousins spent their days in the drawing-room. However, she said nothing about sending me to school, but I felt sure she would not let me stay in her house much longer. Her glances towards me showed a deep, unmovable dislike.\n\nEliza and Georgiana, clearly following instructions, barely spoke to me. John would make mocking faces at me and once tried to hit me. I fought back right away with the same anger and rebellion that had stirred in me before, and he quickly backed off, running to his mother and complaining that I had hit him. I had aimed a blow at his nose, and whether from that or my expression, he was scared enough to flee. When I heard him crying as he told Mrs. Reed that I had attacked him \"like a wild cat,\" she stopped him sharply, saying, \"Don’t talk to me about her, John: I told you not to go near her; she is not worthy of notice; I do not choose that either you or your sisters should associate with her.\"\n\nAt that moment, I suddenly cried out from the banister, not even thinking about what I was saying: \"They are not fit to associate with me.\" Mrs. Reed, despite her stoutness, dashed up the stairs, grabbed me, swept me into the nursery, forced me down on the edge of my bed, and warned me sternly not to move or speak for the rest of the day.\n\nI then asked almost involuntarily, as though the words spoke themselves, \"What would Uncle Reed say to you, if he were alive?\" Mrs. Reed seemed unnerved; her cold, calm eyes filled with a strange fear. She let go of my arm and stared at me as if she wasn’t sure whether I was a child or something worse.\n\nI continued, \"My Uncle Reed is in heaven, and can see everything you do and think; so can my parents. They know how you lock me up all day and wish I were dead.\"\n\nMrs. Reed quickly recovered, shook me harshly, slapped both my ears, and left the room in silence. Bessie filled the silence with a lengthy lecture, insisting I was the worst, most wicked child ever raised. I almost believed her, for I felt only bad emotions surging within me."

          "text_segment": "November, December, and half of January passed away. Christmas and the New Year had been celebrated at Gateshead with the usual festive cheer; presents had been interchanged, dinners and evening parties given. From every enjoyment I was, of course, excluded: my share of the gaiety consisted in witnessing the daily apparelling of Eliza and Georgiana, and seeing them descend to the drawing-room, dressed out in thin muslin frocks and scarlet sashes, with hair elaborately ringletted; and afterwards, in listening to the sound of the piano or the harp played below, to the passing to and fro of the butler and footman, to the jingling of glass and china as refreshments were handed, to the broken hum of conversation as the drawing-room door opened and closed. When tired of this occupation, I would retire from the stairhead to the solitary and silent nursery: there, though somewhat sad, I was not miserable. To speak truth, I had not the least wish to go into company, for in company I was very rarely noticed; and if Bessie had but been kind and companionable, I should have deemed it a treat to spend the evenings quietly with her, instead of passing them under the formidable eye of Mrs. Reed, in a room full of ladies and gentlemen. But Bessie, as soon as she had dressed her young ladies, used to take herself off to the lively regions of the kitchen and housekeeper’s room, generally bearing the candle along with her. I then sat with my doll on my knee till the fire got low, glancing round occasionally to make sure that nothing worse than myself haunted the shadowy room; and when the embers sank to a dull red, I undressed hastily, tugging at knots and strings as I best might, and sought shelter from cold and darkness in my crib. To this crib I always took my doll; human beings must love something, and, in the dearth of worthier objects of affection, I contrived to find a pleasure in loving and cherishing a faded graven image, shabby as a miniature scarecrow. It puzzles me now to remember with what absurd sincerity I doated on this little toy, half fancying it alive and capable of sensation. I could not sleep unless it was folded in my night-gown; and when it lay there safe and warm, I was comparatively happy, believing it to be happy likewise.",

Christmas and the New Year were celebrated at Gateshead with the usual holiday festivities, including the exchange of presents and various dinner and evening parties. I was, of course, excluded from all these enjoyable events. My participation in the fun was limited to watching Eliza and Georgiana get dressed each day in their thin party dresses, red sashes, and elaborately curled hair before they went down to the drawing-room. Afterward, I would listen from the top of the stairs to the sound of the piano or harp from below, the movements of the butler and footman, the clinking of glass and china as refreshments were served, and the muffled noise of conversation when the drawing-room door opened and closed. When I grew tired of this, I would withdraw from the stairhead to the solitary and quiet nursery. While I felt a bit sad there, I wasn't miserable. To be honest, I had no desire to be in company, as I was almost never noticed. I would have much preferred spending the evenings quietly with Bessie, had she been kind and good company, rather than being under Mrs. Reed's watchful eye in a room full of guests. But Bessie, having finished dressing the young ladies, would usually head off to the more lively kitchen and housekeeper's quarters, often taking the only candle with her. I would then sit with my doll on my lap until the fire dwindled, occasionally glancing around the shadowy room to make sure nothing worse than myself was lurking there. When the embers glowed only a dull red, I would quickly undress, struggling with knots and ties as best I could, and seek refuge from the cold and darkness in my small bed. I always took my doll to bed with me; people need to love something, and lacking more deserving objects for my affection, I found comfort in loving and cherishing a faded, carved doll, which looked quite like a miniature scarecrow. Even now, I am puzzled by the intense sincerity with which I adored this little toy, sometimes half-believing it was alive and could feel things. I couldn't sleep unless it was tucked into my nightgown, and when it was safe and warm there, I felt relatively happy, assuming it felt happy too.",

The holidays had been enjoyed at Gateshead as usual—there were gifts exchanged, special meals, and evening gatherings. Naturally, I was left out of all these pleasures; my only involvement was to watch Eliza and Georgiana get dressed each day in their delicate frocks and bright sashes, their hair styled in elaborate curls, before they went downstairs to join the others. I listened to the music played on the piano or harp, and to the sounds of servants moving about and refreshments being served, as well as the faint buzz of conversation from the drawing-room whenever its door opened. When I grew weary of observing from the stairs, I would retreat to the quiet and lonely nursery. Although I sometimes felt a little sad there, I wasn’t unhappy. Honestly, I had no desire to join the others, since I was hardly acknowledged in company; and if Bessie had been friendly and stayed with me, I would have preferred spending the evenings quietly with her to sitting under Mrs. Reed’s stern gaze in a crowded room. But as soon as Bessie finished dressing the girls, she would head off to the lively kitchen or housekeeper’s room, usually taking the candle with her. I would then sit with my doll in my lap until the fire burned low, glancing around the shadowy room to assure myself that nothing scarier than myself lurked there; and, as the embers faded, I would hurriedly undress myself as best I could and climb into bed to escape the cold and dark. I always brought my doll with me; people need something to love, and, lacking better objects of affection, I found comfort in caring for this shabby, worn little doll. It seems strange now how intensely I adored the toy, almost believing it was alive and could feel. I couldn’t sleep unless it was wrapped in my night-gown by my side, and with it safe and warm, I felt relatively content, believing it felt the same."

She had a turn for traffic, and a marked propensity for saving; shown not only in the vending of eggs and chickens, but also in driving hard bargains with the gardener about flower-roots, seeds, and slips of plants; that functionary having orders from Mrs. Reed to buy of his young lady all the products of her parterre she wished to sell: and Eliza would have sold the hair off her head if she could have made a handsome profit thereby. As to her money, she first secreted it in odd corners, wrapped in a rag or an old curl-paper; but some of these hoards having been discovered by the housemaid, Eliza, fearful of one day losing her valued treasure, consented to intrust it to her mother, at a usurious rate of interest—fifty or sixty per cent.; which interest she exacted every quarter, keeping her accounts in a little book with anxious accuracy.\nGeorgiana sat on a high stool, dressing her hair at the glass, and interweaving her curls with artificial flowers and faded feathers, of which she had found a store in a drawer in the attic. I was making my bed, having received strict orders from Bessie to get it arranged before she returned (for Bessie now frequently employed me as a sort of under-nurserymaid, to tidy the room, dust the chairs, &c.). Having spread the quilt and folded my night-dress, I went to the window-seat to put in order some picture-books and doll’s house furniture scattered there; an abrupt command from Georgiana to let her playthings alone (for the tiny chairs and mirrors, the fairy plates and cups, were her property) stopped my proceedings; and then, for lack of other occupation, I fell to breathing on the frost-flowers with which the window was fretted, and thus clearing a space in the glass through which I might look out on the grounds, where all was still and petrified under the influence of a hard frost.\nFrom this window were visible the porter’s lodge and the carriage-road, and just as I had dissolved so much of the silver-white foliage veiling the panes as left room to look out, I saw the gates thrown open and a carriage roll through. I watched it ascending the drive with indifference; carriages often came to Gateshead, but none ever brought visitors in whom I was interested; it stopped in front of the house, the door-bell rang loudly, the new-comer was admitted. All this being nothing to me, my vacant attention soon found livelier attraction in the spectacle of a little hungry robin, which came and chirruped on the twigs of the leafless cherry-tree nailed against the wall near the casement. The remains of my breakfast of bread and milk stood on the table, and having crumbled a morsel of roll, I was tugging at the sash to put out the crumbs on the window-sill, when Bessie came running upstairs into the nursery.\n“Miss Jane, take off your pinafore; what are you doing there? Have you washed your hands and face this morning?” I gave another tug before I answered, for I wanted the bird to be secure of its bread: the sash yielded; I scattered the crumbs, some on the stone sill, some on the cherry-tree bough, then, closing the window, I replied—\n“No, Bessie; I have only just finished dusting.”\n“Troublesome, careless child! and what are you doing now? You look quite red, as if you had been about some mischief: what were you opening the window for?”\nI was spared the trouble of answering, for Bessie seemed in too great a hurry to listen to explanations; she hauled me to the washstand, inflicted a merciless, but happily brief scrub on my face and hands with soap, water, and a coarse towel; disciplined my head with a bristly brush, denuded me of my pinafore, and then hurrying me to the top of the stairs, bid me go down directly, as I was wanted in the breakfast-room.\nI would have asked who wanted me: I would have demanded if Mrs. Reed was there; but Bessie was already gone, and had closed the nursery-door upon me.",
          "paraphrase_gemini-2.5-flash-preview-04-17": "It was the morning of January 15th, around nine o'clock. Bessie was downstairs eating breakfast, and my cousins had not yet been called by their mother. Eliza was getting ready to put on her hat and warm garden coat to go feed her chickens, an activity she enjoyed. She also liked selling the eggs to the housekeeper and saving the money she earned. She had a knack for business and a strong inclination towards saving, evident not only in selling eggs and chickens but also in negotiating tough deals with the gardener for plant roots, seeds, and cuttings. Mrs. Reed had instructed the gardener to buy whatever products from Eliza's garden plot she wished to sell. Eliza would have even sold her own hair if she could have made a good profit from it. Initially, she hid her money in various secret places, wrapped in scraps of cloth or old curl-papers. However, after the housemaid found some of these hidden stashes, Eliza, worried about losing her valuable savings, agreed to give the money to her mother for safekeeping, demanding a very high interest rate—fifty or sixty percent—which she insisted on receiving every three months, keeping meticulous records in a small notebook. Georgiana was sitting on a tall stool, styling her hair in front of the mirror, weaving artificial flowers and faded feathers she had found in a drawer in the attic into her curls. I was making my bed, having been given strict instructions by Bessie to finish it before she returned (Bessie now often used me as a kind of assistant nurserymaid to clean the room, dust furniture, etc.). After spreading the bedspread and folding my nightgown, I went to the window seat to arrange some picture books and dollhouse furniture scattered there. Georgiana sharply ordered me to leave her toys alone (the small chairs, mirrors, tiny plates, and cups belonged to her), which stopped me. Then, having nothing else to do, I began breathing on the icy patterns covering the windowpane, clearing a spot so I could look out at the grounds, which were completely still and frozen by the severe frost. From this window, the porter's lodge and the carriage road were visible. Just as I had melted away enough of the frosty, silvery-white covering on the glass to see outside, I saw the gates open and a carriage drive through. I watched it come up the driveway without much interest; carriages frequently arrived at Gateshead, but they never brought visitors I cared about. It stopped in front of the house, the doorbell rang loudly, and the newcomer was let in. Since none of this concerned me, my unfocused attention was soon drawn to the more interesting sight of a small, hungry robin that landed and chirped on the bare branches of the cherry tree fastened to the wall near the window. The leftovers from my breakfast of bread and milk were on the table. I crumbled a piece of bread and was struggling to open the window sash to put the crumbs on the windowsill when Bessie came running upstairs into the nursery. \"Miss Jane, take off your apron! What are you doing there? Did you wash your hands and face this morning?\" I gave another tug before answering, wanting to make sure the bird would get the bread. The sash finally moved; I scattered the crumbs, some on the stone sill and some on the cherry tree branch. Then, closing the window, I replied, \"No, Bessie; I've only just finished dusting.\" \"You troublesome, careless child! What are you doing now? You look quite red, as if you've been causing trouble. Why were you opening the window?\" I didn't have to answer because Bessie seemed too rushed to listen to any explanation. She dragged me to the washstand and gave my face and hands a rough, though thankfully quick, scrub with soap, water, and a stiff towel. She roughly brushed my hair, took off my apron, and then hurried me to the top of the stairs, telling me to go downstairs immediately because I was needed in the breakfast room. I would have asked who wanted me; I would have demanded to know if Mrs. Reed was there. But Bessie was already gone and had closed the nursery door behind her.",

Eliza was getting ready to go outside and feed the chickens, which she enjoyed, along with selling the eggs to the housekeeper and saving the money she made. Eliza was fond of making deals and saving money, not just from selling eggs and chickens, but also from bargaining with the gardener over plants and seeds. The gardener had instructions from Mrs. Reed to purchase anything from Eliza's garden that she wanted to sell, and Eliza was so focused on profits that she would have even sold her hair for a good price. She initially hid her money in various places wrapped up in cloth or paper, but after some of her hiding spots were found by the housemaid, she decided to give the money to her mother, but only at a steep interest rate, keeping careful track of payments in her notebook.\n\nMeanwhile, Georgiana was sitting high up on a stool, fixing her hair at a mirror and decorating it with fake flowers and old feathers she found in the attic. I was making my bed as Bessie had instructed, since she often had me help tidy the room and dust the furniture. After I finished folding my nightclothes and straightening the quilt, I went to organize some scattered picture-books and dollhouse furniture by the window, but Georgiana told me sharply not to touch her toys, so with nothing else to do, I started breathing on the frosted window to melt the ice and make a spot to look outside, where everything was still and frozen in the cold.\n\nFrom the window, I could see the lodge and the driveway. As soon as I had cleared enough frost to look out, I noticed a carriage coming through the gates. I watched it approach without much interest since there were often visitors, but never anyone I cared about. The carriage stopped in front of the house, the bell rang, and the visitor was let inside. Uninterested, my attention turned instead to a hungry little robin sitting on a cherry tree branch near the window. I still had some bread left from breakfast and tried to open the window to scatter crumbs for the bird when Bessie suddenly rushed back into the room.\n\nShe scolded me, asking what I was doing and if I had washed up yet. I finished opening the window and placed the crumbs outside before answering. Bessie, in a hurry, didn't wait for my explanation, but grabbed me and scrubbed my face and hands, quickly brushed my hair, took off my pinafore, and hurried me to the stairs, telling me to go down because I was wanted in the breakfast-room.\n\nI wanted to ask who wanted me and if Mrs. Reed was there, but Bessie had already left and shut the nursery door behind me."

          "text_segment": "I slowly descended. For nearly three months, I had never been called to Mrs. Reed’s presence; restricted so long to the nursery, the breakfast, dining, and drawing-rooms were become for me awful regions, on which it dismayed me to intrude.\nI now stood in the empty hall; before me was the breakfast-room door, and I stopped, intimidated and trembling. What a miserable little poltroon had fear, engendered of unjust punishment, made of me in those days! I feared to return to the nursery, and feared to go forward to the parlour; ten minutes I stood in agitated hesitation; the vehement ringing of the breakfast-room bell decided me; I must enter.\n“Who could want me?” I asked inwardly, as with both hands I turned the stiff door-handle, which, for a second or two, resisted my efforts. “What should I see besides Aunt Reed in the apartment?—a man or a woman?” The handle turned, the door unclosed, and passing through and curtseying low, I looked up at—a black pillar!—such, at least, appeared to me, at first sight, the straight, narrow, sable-clad shape standing erect on the rug: the grim face at the top was like a carved mask, placed above the shaft by way of capital.\nMrs. Reed occupied her usual seat by the fireside; she made a signal to me to approach; I did so, and she introduced me to the stony stranger with the words: “This is the little girl respecting whom I applied to you.”\nHe, for it was a man, turned his head slowly towards where I stood, and having examined me with the two inquisitive-looking grey eyes which twinkled under a pair of bushy brows, said solemnly, and in a bass voice, “Her size is small: what is her age?”\n“Ten years.”\n“So much?” was the doubtful answer; and he prolonged his scrutiny for some minutes. Presently he addressed me—“Your name, little girl?”\n“Jane Eyre, sir.”\nIn uttering these words I looked up: he seemed to me a tall gentleman; but then I was very little; his features were large, and they and all the lines of his frame were equally harsh and prim.\n“Well, Jane Eyre, and are you a good child?”\nImpossible to reply to this in the affirmative: my little world held a contrary opinion: I was silent. Mrs. Reed answered for me by an expressive shake of the head, adding soon, “Perhaps the less said on that subject the better, Mr. Brocklehurst.”\n“Sorry indeed to hear it! she and I must have some talk;” and bending from the perpendicular, he installed his person in the arm-chair opposite Mrs. Reed’s. “Come here,” he said.\nI stepped across the rug; he placed me square and straight before him. What a face he had, now that it was almost on a level with mine! what a great nose! and what a mouth! and what large prominent teeth!\n“No sight so sad as that of a naughty child,” he began, “especially a naughty little girl. Do you know where the wicked go after death?”\n“They go to hell,” was my ready and orthodox answer.\n“And what is hell? Can you tell me that?”\n“A pit full of fire.”\n“And should you like to fall into that pit, and to be burning there for ever?”\n“No, sir.”\n“What must you do to avoid it?”\nI deliberated a moment; my answer, when it did come, was objectionable: “I must keep in good health, and not die.”\n“How can you keep in good health? Children younger than you die daily. I buried a little child of five years old only a day or two since,—a good little child, whose soul is now in heaven. It is to be feared the same could not be said of you were you to be called hence.”\nNot being in a condition to remove his doubt, I only cast my eyes down on the two large feet planted on the rug, and sighed, wishing myself far enough away.\n“I hope that sigh is from the heart, and that you repent of ever having been the occasion of discomfort to your excellent benefactress.”\n“Benefactress! benefactress!” said I inwardly: “they all call Mrs. Reed my benefactress; if so, a benefactress is a disagreeable thing.”\n“Do you say your prayers night and morning?” continued my interrogator.\n“Yes, sir.”\n“Do you read your Bible?”\n“Sometimes.”\n“With pleasure? Are you fond of it?”\n“I like Revelations, and the book of Daniel, and Genesis and Samuel, and a little bit of Exodus, and some parts of Kings and Chronicles, and Job and Jonah.”\n“And the Psalms? I hope you like them?”\n“No, sir.”\n“No? oh, shocking! I have a little boy, younger than you, who knows six Psalms by heart: and when you ask him which he would rather have, a gingerbread-nut to eat or a verse of a Psalm to learn, he says: ‘Oh! the verse of a Psalm! angels sing Psalms;’ says he, ‘I wish to be a little angel here below;’ he then gets two nuts in recompense for his infant piety.”\n“Psalms are not interesting,” I remarked.\n“That proves you have a wicked heart; and you must pray to God to change it: to give you a new and clean one: to take away your heart of stone and give you a heart of flesh.”\nI was about to propound a question, touching the manner in which that operation of changing my heart was to be performed, when Mrs. Reed interposed, telling me to sit down; she then proceeded to carry on the conversation herself.",
          "paraphrase_gemini-2.5-flash-preview-04-17": "I walked down the stairs slowly. For almost three months, I had not been summoned into Mrs. Reed's presence; being confined to the nursery for so long, the breakfast, dining, and drawing-rooms had become intimidating places for me, where I dreaded going. I now stood in the empty hallway; the breakfast-room door was in front of me, and I paused, feeling afraid and shaky. How much of a pathetic little coward fear, resulting from unfair punishment, had made me in those days! I was scared to go back to the nursery and scared to proceed to the parlour. I stood there for ten minutes, feeling anxious and uncertain. The loud ringing of the breakfast-room bell made up my mind; I had to go in. “Who could be calling for me?” I wondered internally, as I used both hands to turn the stiff door-handle, which resisted my efforts for a few seconds. “Besides Aunt Reed, what would I see in the room?—a man or a woman?” The handle turned, the door opened, and stepping through and curtsying low, I looked up at—what appeared to me, at first sight, to be a black column!—such was the impression of the straight, narrow, dark-clad figure standing upright on the rug. The stern face at the top looked like a carved mask placed above the shaft as a decoration. Mrs. Reed was seated in her usual spot by the fire. She signaled for me to come nearer; I did so, and she introduced me to the unfeeling-looking stranger, saying, “This is the little girl about whom I contacted you.” He, for it was a man, turned his head slowly towards where I stood, and after examining me with his two curious grey eyes that twinkled under a pair of thick eyebrows, he said solemnly, in a deep voice, “Her size is small: what is her age?” “Ten years.” “As much as that?” was the doubtful reply; and he continued his close inspection for several minutes. Soon after, he addressed me—“Your name, little girl?” “Jane Eyre, sir.” As I spoke these words, I looked up: he seemed to me a tall gentleman; but then, I was very small. His features were large, and both they and the outline of his body were equally harsh and rigid. “Well, Jane Eyre, and are you a good child?” It was impossible to answer this affirmatively: my limited experience suggested otherwise. I remained silent. Mrs. Reed answered for me with an expressive shake of her head, quickly adding, “Perhaps the less said on that matter the better, Mr. Brocklehurst.” “Indeed, I am sorry to hear it! she and I must have a discussion;” and bending forward from his upright posture, he settled himself into the armchair opposite Mrs. Reed’s. “Come here,” he commanded. I walked across the rug; he positioned me directly and squarely in front of him. What a face he had, now that it was almost level with mine! What a huge nose! And what a mouth! And what large, protruding teeth! “There is no sight so sad as that of a disobedient child,” he began, “especially a disobedient little girl. Do you know where the wicked go after death?” “They go to hell,” was my immediate and conventional answer. “And what is hell? Can you describe that to me?” “A pit filled with fire.” “And would you like to fall into that pit, and burn there forever?” “No, sir.” “What must you do to avoid it?” I thought for a moment; my answer, when it finally came, was unacceptable: “I must stay healthy, and not die.” “How can you guarantee good health? Children younger than you die daily. I buried a small child of five years old just a day or two ago—a good little child, whose soul is now in heaven. It is to be feared the same could not be said of you were you to be taken from here.” Not being in a position to resolve his doubt, I merely cast my eyes down at the two large feet placed on the rug, and sighed, wishing I were far away. “I hope that sigh comes from the heart, and that you regret ever having been the cause of discomfort to your excellent benefactress.” “Benefactress! benefactress!” I thought to myself: “they all call Mrs. Reed my benefactress; if so, a benefactress is something unpleasant.” “Do you say your prayers morning and evening?” my questioner continued. “Yes, sir.” “Do you read your Bible?” “Sometimes.” “With enjoyment? Are you fond of it?” “I like Revelations, and the book of Daniel, and Genesis and Samuel, and a little bit of Exodus, and some parts of Kings and Chronicles, and Job and Jonah.” “And the Psalms? I hope you like those?” “No, sir.” “No? oh, appalling! I have a little boy, younger than you, who knows six Psalms by heart: and when you ask him which he would rather have, a gingerbread-nut to eat or a verse of a Psalm to learn, he says: ‘Oh! the verse of a Psalm! angels sing Psalms;’ he says, ‘I wish to be a little angel here below;’ he then receives two nuts as compensation for his young piety.” “Psalms are not interesting,” I commented. “That proves you have a wicked heart; and you must pray to God to change it: to give you a new and pure one: to remove your heart of stone and give you a heart of flesh.” I was about to propose a question concerning the method by which that operation of changing my heart was to be carried out, when Mrs. Reed intervened, telling me to sit down; she then proceeded to conduct the conversation herself.",
          "paraphrase_gpt-4.1-2025-04-14": "I walked down the stairs slowly. For almost three months, no one had summoned me to see Mrs. Reed; having been kept in the nursery for so long, the breakfast room, dining room, and drawing room felt like intimidating places to me, and I was afraid to enter them. I found myself alone in the hall, facing the door to the breakfast room, and I paused, feeling nervous and shaking. Fear, caused by unfair punishment, had made me weak and cowardly in those days! I was too scared to go back to the nursery and just as scared to go into the parlor; for about ten minutes I stood there, anxiously hesitant. Then, the loud ringing of the breakfast-room bell forced me to act—I had to go in.\n\nI wondered to myself, as I struggled to turn the stiff doorknob, “Who wants to see me? Will I find only Aunt Reed inside, or someone else—perhaps a man or a woman?” Eventually, the handle turned, and I opened the door. As I curtsied low and looked up, I saw what looked at first like a black pillar – it was in fact a tall, thin person dressed in black, standing upright like a column; his stern face resembled a carved statue head placed atop a column. Mrs. Reed was sitting by the fire as usual, and she motioned for me to come closer. She introduced me to the severe-looking stranger, saying, “This is the little girl I asked you about.”\n\nThe man slowly turned his head towards me and studied me with sharp-looking grey eyes under bushy brows. In a deep voice, he solemnly said, “She’s small—how old is she?”\n\n“Ten.”\n\n“So old?” he asked doubtfully, still examining me closely. After some moments, he asked, “What’s your name, little girl?”\n\n“Jane Eyre, sir,” I replied. Looking up, I thought he seemed very tall, though perhaps that was just because I was so little. His features were large and his whole appearance was severe and strict.\n\n“Well, Jane Eyre, are you a good child?”\n\nThere was no way I could answer yes—everyone in my world thought the opposite—so I stayed silent. Mrs. Reed responded with a meaningful shake of her head, adding, “The less we say about that, the better, Mr. Brocklehurst.”\n\n“That's unfortunate! She and I must talk,” he said, and then sat himself in the armchair opposite Mrs. Reed. “Come here,” he ordered.\n\nI crossed the rug, and he positioned me right in front of him. From this close, his face looked even more striking – a very large nose, a wide mouth, and big, prominent teeth.\n\n“No sight is sadder than a naughty child,” he began, “especially a naughty little girl. Do you know where wicked people go when they die?”\n\n“They go to hell,” I replied promptly, giving the answer expected of me.\n\n“And what is hell? Can you explain?”\n\n“A pit full of fire.”\n\n“And would you like to fall into that pit, and burn there forever?”\n\n“No, sir.”\n\n“What must you do to avoid going there?”\n\nI thought for a moment, and then—though I knew it was the wrong answer—replied, “I must stay healthy, and not die.”\n\n“How can you be sure to stay healthy? Younger children die every day. Just a day or two ago I buried a five-year-old child—a good child whose soul is now in heaven. I fear the same could not be said of you if you were to die now.”\n\nSince I couldn’t convince him otherwise, I only looked down at his big feet on the rug and sighed, wishing I could be far away.\n\n“I hope that sigh comes from your heart, and that you regret causing trouble to your kind benefactress.”\n\n“Benefactress! Benefactress!” I repeated to myself, “They all call Mrs. Reed my benefactress; if that’s what a benefactress is, it is not a pleasant thing.”\n\n“Do you say your prayers in the morning and at night?” he continued.\n\n“Yes, sir.”\n\n“Do you read your Bible?”\n\n“Sometimes.”\n\n“Do you enjoy it? Do you like reading it?”\n\n“I like Revelation, Daniel, Genesis, Samuel, and a little of Exodus, and some of Kings and Chronicles, as well as Job and Jonah.”\n\n“And what about the Psalms? I hope you enjoy reading those?”\n\n“No, sir.”\n\n“No? How shocking! I have a little boy, younger than you, who knows six Psalms by heart; when asked if he’d prefer a gingerbread nut or a verse of a Psalm, he always chooses the Psalm. He says, ‘Angels sing Psalms; I want to be a little angel here on earth.’ As a reward for his piety he actually gets two nuts.”\n\n“I don’t find Psalms interesting,” I replied.\n\n“That shows you have a wicked heart, and you must pray to God to change it—ask him to give you a new, clean one; to replace your hard heart with one of flesh.”\n\nI was about to ask how this change of heart was supposed to happen, but Mrs. Reed interrupted, telling me to sit down. She then took over the conversation herself."

I mention this in your hearing, Jane, that you may not attempt to impose on Mr. Brocklehurst.”\nWell might I dread, well might I dislike Mrs. Reed; for it was her nature to wound me cruelly; never was I happy in her presence; however carefully I obeyed, however strenuously I strove to please her, my efforts were still repulsed and repaid by such sentences as the above. Now, uttered before a stranger, the accusation cut me to the heart; I dimly perceived that she was already obliterating hope from the new phase of existence which she destined me to enter; I felt, though I could not have expressed the feeling, that she was sowing aversion and unkindness along my future path; I saw myself transformed under Mr. Brocklehurst’s eye into an artful, noxious child, and what could I do to remedy the injury?\n“Nothing, indeed,” thought I, as I struggled to repress a sob, and hastily wiped away some tears, the impotent evidences of my anguish.\n“Deceit is, indeed, a sad fault in a child,” said Mr. Brocklehurst; “it is akin to falsehood, and all liars will have their portion in the lake burning with fire and brimstone; she shall, however, be watched, Mrs. Reed. I will speak to Miss Temple and the teachers.”\n“I should wish her to be brought up in a manner suiting her prospects,” continued my benefactress; “to be made useful, to be kept humble: as for the vacations, she will, with your permission, spend them always at Lowood.”\n“Your decisions are perfectly judicious, madam,” returned Mr. Brocklehurst. “Humility is a Christian grace, and one peculiarly appropriate to the pupils of Lowood; I, therefore, direct that especial care shall be bestowed on its cultivation amongst them. I have studied how best to mortify in them the worldly sentiment of pride; and, only the other day, I had a pleasing proof of my success. My second daughter, Augusta, went with her mama to visit the school, and on her return she exclaimed: ‘Oh, dear papa, how quiet and plain all the girls at Lowood look, with their hair combed behind their ears, and their long pinafores, and those little holland pockets outside their frocks—they are almost like poor people’s children! and,’ said she, ‘they looked at my dress and mama’s, as if they had never seen a silk gown before.’”\n“This is the state of things I quite approve,” returned Mrs. Reed; “had I sought all England over, I could scarcely have found a system more exactly fitting a child like Jane Eyre. Consistency, my dear Mr. Brocklehurst; I advocate consistency in all things.”\n“Consistency, madam, is the first of Christian duties; and it has been observed in every arrangement connected with the establishment of Lowood: plain fare, simple attire, unsophisticated accommodations, hardy and active habits; such is the order of the day in the house and its inhabitants.”\n“Quite right, sir. I may then depend upon this child being received as a pupil at Lowood, and there being trained in conformity to her position and prospects?”\n“Madam, you may: she shall be placed in that nursery of chosen plants, and I trust she will show herself grateful for the inestimable privilege of her election.”\n“I will send her, then, as soon as possible, Mr. Brocklehurst; for, I assure you, I feel anxious to be relieved of a responsibility that was becoming too irksome.”\n“No doubt, no doubt, madam; and now I wish you good morning. I shall return to Brocklehurst Hall in the course of a week or two: my good friend, the Archdeacon, will not permit me to leave him sooner. I shall send Miss Temple notice that she is to expect a new girl, so that there will be no difficulty about receiving her. Good-bye.”\n“Good-bye, Mr. Brocklehurst; remember me to Mrs. and Miss Brocklehurst, and to Augusta and Theodore, and Master Broughton Brocklehurst.”\n“I will, madam. Little girl, here is a book entitled the ‘Child’s Guide’; read it with prayer, especially that part containing ‘An account of the awfully sudden death of Martha G——, a naughty child addicted to falsehood and deceit.’”\nWith these words Mr. Brocklehurst put into my hand a thin pamphlet sewn in a cover, and having rung for his carriage, he departed.",
          "paraphrase_gemini-2.5-flash-preview-04-17": "Speaking to Mr. Brocklehurst, Mrs. Reed mentioned, as she had in her letter three weeks prior, that I, the young girl, lacked the desired character and nature. She requested that if he accepted me into Lowood school, the headmistress and teachers should supervise me closely, particularly watching out for my worst flaw: being prone to dishonesty. She added that she was saying this in my presence so I wouldn't try to mislead Mr. Brocklehurst. I had every reason to fear and dislike Mrs. Reed, as she was naturally cruel to me. I was never content when she was around; no matter how carefully I obeyed or how hard I tried to please her, my efforts were met with rejection and harsh words like those she had just spoken. Hearing her accusation in front of a visitor cut me deeply. I faintly understood that she was already extinguishing any hope for the new chapter of life she was sending me into. I felt, though I couldn't put it into words, that she was planting seeds of dislike and unkindness along my future path. I saw myself being transformed in Mr. Brocklehurst’s eyes into a cunning, troublesome child, and I felt utterly helpless to fix the harm. 'Indeed, nothing,' I thought to myself, struggling to suppress a sob and quickly wiping away tears, which were the helpless signs of my distress. Mr. Brocklehurst remarked that 'Deceit is truly a sad fault in a child; it is related to lying, and all liars will face judgment in the burning lake of fire and brimstone.' He assured Mrs. Reed, 'She will, however, be monitored. I will speak with Miss Temple and the teachers.' Mrs. Reed continued, my 'benefactress,' stating, 'I wish her to be raised in a manner fitting her future prospects; to be made useful, to be kept humble. As for school breaks, with your consent, she will always spend them at Lowood.' Mr. Brocklehurst replied, 'Your decisions, madam, are perfectly sound. Humility is a Christian virtue, and one especially suitable for the students at Lowood. Therefore, I instruct that particular attention be paid to cultivating it among them. I have considered the best ways to suppress worldly pride in them, and just recently, I had a pleasing demonstration of my success. My second daughter, Augusta, visited the school with her mother, and upon returning, she exclaimed: ‘Oh, dear papa, how calm and plain all the girls at Lowood appear, with their hair neatly combed behind their ears, their long aprons, and those small cotton pockets on the outside of their dresses—they look almost like poor people’s children! And,’ she added, ‘they stared at my dress and mama’s as if they had never seen a silk gown before.' Mrs. Reed responded, 'This is exactly the situation I approve of. Had I searched throughout England, I could hardly have found a system more precisely suited to a child like Jane Eyre. Consistency, my dear Mr. Brocklehurst; I believe in consistency in all matters.' 'Consistency, madam,' Mr. Brocklehurst agreed, 'is the most important Christian duty, and it has been observed in every arrangement related to the founding of Lowood: simple meals, plain clothing, basic living conditions, and active, hardy habits. This is the standard practice for the institution and its residents.' 'Quite right, sir. May I then be sure that this child will be accepted as a student at Lowood and educated according to her status and expectations?' 'Madam, you may rest assured: she will be placed in that breeding ground for selected individuals, and I trust she will be thankful for the immense privilege of being chosen.' 'Then I will send her as soon as possible, Mr. Brocklehurst; for, I must tell you, I am eager to be relieved of a responsibility that had become too burdensome.' 'Undoubtedly, undoubtedly, madam; and now I wish you good morning. I will return to Brocklehurst Hall within a week or two; my good friend, the Archdeacon, won't allow me to depart sooner. I will send word to Miss Temple that she should expect a new girl, so there will be no trouble with her admission. Good-bye.' 'Good-bye, Mr. Brocklehurst; please give my regards to Mrs. and Miss Brocklehurst, and to Augusta and Theodore, and Master Broughton Brocklehurst.' 'I will, madam. Little girl,' he said to me, 'here is a book titled the ‘Child’s Guide’; read it diligently, especially the section containing ‘An account of the terribly sudden death of Martha G——, a disobedient child prone to lying and deceit.’' With these words, Mr. Brocklehurst placed a thin stitched pamphlet into my hand, and after ringing for his carriage, he departed.",
          "paraphrase_gpt-4.1-2025-04-14": "Mrs. Reed addressed Mr. Brocklehurst, reminding him of her letter from three weeks prior, in which she mentioned that Jane's character and disposition did not meet her expectations. She requested that if Jane were admitted to Lowood School, the staff should watch her closely, especially to prevent her from acting deceitfully, which she referred to as Jane's greatest flaw. Mrs. Reed spoke this in Jane's presence to discourage Jane from trying to deceive Mr. Brocklehurst. Jane felt justified in fearing and disliking Mrs. Reed, since she always seemed intent on hurting her; nothing Jane did ever pleased her, and her efforts were consistently met with such harsh words. Hearing this accusation directed at her in front of a stranger was especially painful to Jane. She sensed that Mrs. Reed was destroying any hope she might have for this new chapter in her life and was paving the way for others to treat her unkindly. Jane imagined that, in Mr. Brocklehurst's eyes, she was becoming a crafty and troublesome child, and she wondered what she could do to fix this injustice—but realized there was nothing she could do, as she tried to stifle her tears.\n\nMr. Brocklehurst then remarked that deceit is a serious vice in a child, as it is close to lying, which is condemned in the Bible. He reassured Mrs. Reed that Jane would be watched, promising to instruct Miss Temple and the teachers accordingly. Mrs. Reed went on to express her wish for Jane to be raised in a way fitting her future, kept useful and humble, and for her to remain at Lowood during holidays. Mr. Brocklehurst agreed with Mrs. Reed, saying her decisions were wise and that humility was especially important for Lowood’s pupils. He shared a story about his own daughter, Augusta, who visited Lowood and remarked how plainly the girls dressed, noting they looked almost like poor children. Mrs. Reed approved of such an environment, insisting that consistency is important. Mr. Brocklehurst replied that consistency is a key Christian virtue, and explained that everything at Lowood—from the simple food and plain dress, to the basic accommodations and active lifestyle—reflected this principle.\n\nMrs. Reed confirmed that Jane would be accepted at Lowood and trained according to her background and needs, to which Mr. Brocklehurst agreed and expressed the hope that Jane would appreciate the opportunity. Mrs. Reed said she would send Jane to Lowood as soon as possible, relieved to relinquish the responsibility. Mr. Brocklehurst bid farewell, mentioning he would soon return to Brocklehurst Hall, and that he would inform Miss Temple to expect Jane. As he left, he handed Jane a book titled 'Child's Guide,' advising her to read, especially the section about a girl who died suddenly because of her dishonesty, and then departed after calling his carriage."

          "text_segment": "Mrs. Reed and I were left alone: some minutes passed in silence; she was sewing, I was watching her. Mrs. Reed might be at that time some six or seven and thirty; she was a woman of robust frame, square-shouldered and strong-limbed, not tall, and, though stout, not obese: she had a somewhat large face, the under jaw being much developed and very solid; her brow was low, her chin large and prominent, mouth and nose sufficiently regular; under her light eyebrows glimmered an eye devoid of ruth; her skin was dark and opaque, her hair nearly flaxen; her constitution was sound as a bell—illness never came near her; she was an exact, clever manager; her household and tenantry were thoroughly under her control; her children only at times defied her authority and laughed it to scorn; she dressed well, and had a presence and port calculated to set off handsome attire.\nSitting on a low stool, a few yards from her arm-chair, I examined her figure; I perused her features. In my hand I held the tract containing the sudden death of the Liar, to which narrative my attention had been pointed as to an appropriate warning. What had just passed; what Mrs. Reed had said concerning me to Mr. Brocklehurst; the whole tenor of their conversation, was recent, raw, and stinging in my mind; I had felt every word as acutely as I had heard it plainly, and a passion of resentment fomented now within me.\nMrs. Reed looked up from her work; her eye settled on mine, her fingers at the same time suspended their nimble movements.\n“Go out of the room; return to the nursery,” was her mandate. My look or something else must have struck her as offensive, for she spoke with extreme though suppressed irritation. I got up, I went to the door; I came back again; I walked to the window, across the room, then close up to her.\nSpeak I must: I had been trodden on severely, and must turn: but how? What strength had I to dart retaliation at my antagonist? I gathered my energies and launched them in this blunt sentence—\n“I am not deceitful: if I were, I should say I loved you; but I declare I do not love you: I dislike you the worst of anybody in the world except John Reed; and this book about the liar, you may give to your girl, Georgiana, for it is she who tells lies, and not I.”\nMrs. Reed’s hands still lay on her work inactive: her eye of ice continued to dwell freezingly on mine.\n“What more have you to say?” she asked, rather in the tone in which a person might address an opponent of adult age than such as is ordinarily used to a child.\nThat eye of hers, that voice stirred every antipathy I had. Shaking from head to foot, thrilled with ungovernable excitement, I continued—\n“I am glad you are no relation of mine: I will never call you aunt again as long as I live. I will never come to see you when I am grown up; and if any one asks me how I liked you, and how you treated me, I will say the very thought of you makes me sick, and that you treated me with miserable cruelty.”\n“How dare you affirm that, Jane Eyre?”\n“How dare I, Mrs. Reed? How dare I? Because it is the truth. You think I have no feelings, and that I can do without one bit of love or kindness; but I cannot live so: and you have no pity. I shall remember how you thrust me back—roughly and violently thrust me back—into the red-room, and locked me up there, to my dying day; though I was in agony; though I cried out, while suffocating with distress, ‘Have mercy! Have mercy, Aunt Reed!’ And that punishment you made me suffer because your wicked boy struck me—knocked me down for nothing. I will tell anybody who asks me questions, this exact tale. People think you a good woman, but you are bad, hard-hearted. You are deceitful!”\nEre I had finished this reply, my soul began to expand, to exult, with the strangest sense of freedom, of triumph, I ever felt. It seemed as if an invisible bond had burst, and that I had struggled out into unhoped-for liberty. Not without cause was this sentiment: Mrs. Reed looked frightened; her work had slipped from her knee; she was lifting up her hands, rocking herself to and fro, and even twisting her face as if she would cry.\n“Jane, you are under a mistake: what is the matter with you? Why do you tremble so violently? Would you like to drink some water?”\n“No, Mrs. Reed.”\n“Is there anything else you wish for, Jane? I assure you, I desire to be your friend.”\n“Not you. You told Mr. Brocklehurst I had a bad character, a deceitful disposition; and I’ll let everybody at Lowood know what you are, and what you have done.”\n“Jane, you don’t understand these things: children must be corrected for their faults.”\n“Deceit is not my fault!” I cried out in a savage, high voice.\n“But you are passionate, Jane, that you must allow: and now return to the nursery—there’s a dear—and lie down a little.”\n“I am not your dear; I cannot lie down: send me to school soon, Mrs. Reed, for I hate to live here.”\n“I will indeed send her to school soon,” murmured Mrs. Reed sotto voce; and gathering up her work, she abruptly quitted the apartment.",
          "paraphrase_gemini-2.5-flash-preview-04-17": "Left alone, Mrs. Reed and I sat in silence for some minutes; she occupied herself with sewing while I observed her. Mrs. Reed was likely around thirty-six or thirty-seven years old at this time. She possessed a sturdy build, with broad shoulders and strong limbs; she wasn't tall but was plump without being excessively large. Her face was rather substantial, featuring a very pronounced and solid lower jaw, a low forehead, a large and jutting chin, and a relatively standard mouth and nose. Beneath her light-colored eyebrows, her eyes held no trace of pity. Her skin was dark and lacked transparency, and her hair was nearly flaxen. Her health was perfectly robust—she was never ill. She was an efficient and shrewd manager, maintaining complete command over her household and tenants; only her children occasionally defied her authority and mocked it. She dressed elegantly and had a bearing and posture that enhanced attractive clothing. Sitting on a low stool a short distance from her armchair, I studied her appearance and examined her features. In my hand, I held the booklet describing the sudden death of a Liar, a story that had been presented to me as a suitable warning. The recent events, what Mrs. Reed had just said about me to Mr. Brocklehurst, and the entire exchange between them were fresh, raw, and painful in my mind. I had felt every word as intensely as I had clearly heard it, and a surge of anger was now building within me. Mrs. Reed glanced up from her work; her gaze settled on mine, and her fingers stopped their quick movements simultaneously. \"Leave the room; go back to the nursery,\" she instructed. My look, or something else about me, must have seemed offensive to her, as she spoke with intense, though controlled, irritation. I stood up and walked towards the door; then I returned, moved to the window, crossed the room, and finally approached her closely. I felt compelled to speak; I had been severely mistreated and needed to push back. But how? What power did I possess to strike back at her? I gathered my resolve and expressed it in this direct statement: \"I am not deceitful. If I were, I would say I loved you; but I declare I do not love you. I dislike you more than anyone in the world except John Reed. And this book about the liar, you should give it to your daughter, Georgiana, because she is the one who tells lies, not me.\" Mrs. Reed's hands remained motionless on her work; her cold eye continued to stare icily at mine. \"What else do you have to say?\" she inquired, using a tone more suited to addressing an adult opponent than a child. That gaze, that voice, stirred every negative feeling I had. Shaking from head to foot, filled with uncontrollable emotion, I continued: \"I am glad you are no relation of mine. I will never call you aunt again as long as I live. I will never come to see you when I am grown up. And if anyone asks me how I liked you, and how you treated me, I will say the very thought of you makes me sick, and that you treated me with miserable cruelty.\" \"How dare you claim that, Jane Eyre?\" \"How dare I, Mrs. Reed? How dare I? Because it is the truth. You think I have no feelings, and that I can manage without any love or kindness at all; but I cannot live like that. And you have no pity. I will remember how you roughly and violently pushed me back into the red-room and locked me up there until my dying day, even though I was in agony, even though I cried out, suffocating with distress, 'Have mercy! Have mercy, Aunt Reed!' And that punishment you made me suffer because your wicked boy struck me—knocked me down for nothing. I will tell this precise story to anyone who asks me questions. People think you are a good woman, but you are bad, hard-hearted. You are the deceitful one!\" Before I had finished this response, my spirit began to expand, to rejoice, with the most unusual sense of freedom and triumph I had ever experienced. It felt as though an unseen restraint had snapped, and I had struggled out into unexpected liberty. This feeling was not without reason: Mrs. Reed looked startled; her sewing had slid from her lap; she was raising her hands, rocking back and forth, and even contorting her face as if she might cry. \"Jane, you are mistaken. What is wrong with you? Why are you trembling so violently? Would you like some water?\" \"No, Mrs. Reed.\" \"Is there anything else you want, Jane? I assure you, I want to be your friend.\" \"Not you. You told Mr. Brocklehurst I had a bad character, a deceitful nature; and I'll make sure everyone at Lowood knows what you are, and what you have done.\" \"Jane, you don't understand these matters. Children must be corrected for their faults.\" \"Deceit is not my fault!\" I exclaimed in a fierce, high voice. \"But you are passionate, Jane, you must admit that. Now, go back to the nursery—there's a dear—and lie down for a little while.\" \"I am not your dear; I cannot lie down. Send me to school soon, Mrs. Reed, because I hate living here.\" \"I will indeed send her to school soon,\" Mrs. Reed murmured quietly; and gathering up her work, she abruptly left the room.",
          "paraphrase_gpt-4.1-2025-04-14": "After everyone else had left, Mrs. Reed and I sat together in silence for a few minutes; she busied herself sewing while I observed her. She was around thirty-six or thirty-seven, with a strong, broad-shouldered build. Though not especially tall or very overweight, her frame was solid. Her face was broad, with a heavy, pronounced jaw, low forehead, and a strong chin. Her nose and mouth were ordinary, but her pale eyebrows framed cold, pitiless eyes; her skin was dark, her hair almost light blond, and she had a constitution that seemed immune to illness. She managed her household efficiently, controlling both staff and tenants, only her children occasionally defied her. She dressed stylishly and carried herself in a way that suited fine clothes. Sitting on a low stool close to her, I studied her appearance, the sharp features, and held in my hand a tract about the sudden death of a liar—meant as a warning for me. The recent conversation between Mrs. Reed and Mr. Brocklehurst still stung; I felt furious and wronged. Mrs. Reed paused her sewing to look at me, her gaze icy. \"Leave the room; go back to the nursery,\" she commanded, her voice tight with anger, likely because she found my look insolent. I rose, went to the door, but then returned, moving restlessly, until I stood by her. I felt compelled to speak up—her treatment had pushed me too far. Mustering my courage, I said bluntly: \"I am not deceitful. If I were, I would say I loved you, but I do not; I dislike you more than anyone, except John Reed. This story about the liar is more suited for your daughter Georgiana, for she lies, not me.\" Mrs. Reed did not respond, just gazed at me coldly, her hands still. She asked calmly if I had anything more to say, speaking as she might to an adult adversary, not a child. Her demeanor only increased my resentment, and trembling with emotion, I burst out: \"I'm glad you are not a real relative; I won't call you aunt again. When I grow up, I won't visit, and if anyone asks, I'll say you made me miserable and treated me cruelly.\" She demanded how I dared say such things, and I replied: \"Because it is true. You think I don't have feelings and need no affection, but I do, and you show no sympathy. I will always remember how you threw me into the red-room and locked me up, despite my suffering, because John attacked me for no reason. I shall tell everyone the truth. People think you are good, but you are hard-hearted and deceitful.\" As I spoke, I suddenly felt liberated, triumphant, as though a heavy burden had been lifted from me. Mrs. Reed appeared frightened, her hands trembling, her face contorted as if she might cry. She asked what was wrong with me, why I trembled, whether I wanted some water, or if I wished for anything else, claiming she wanted to be my friend. I replied that I did not want her friendship and would tell everyone at Lowood about her cruelty and lies. She insisted children must be corrected, but I protested that deceit was not my flaw. She accused me of being passionate and told me to return to the nursery and rest. I answered that I was not her dear, couldn't rest, and wanted to go to school because I hated living there. Softly, Mrs. Reed agreed to send me to school soon, then hastily left the room with her sewing."

          "text_segment": "I was left there alone—winner of the field. It was the hardest battle I had fought, and the first victory I had gained: I stood awhile on the rug, where Mr. Brocklehurst had stood, and I enjoyed my conqueror’s solitude. First, I smiled to myself and felt elate; but this fierce pleasure subsided in me as fast as did the accelerated throb of my pulses. A child cannot quarrel with its elders, as I had done; cannot give its furious feelings uncontrolled play, as I had given mine, without experiencing afterwards the pang of remorse and the chill of reaction. A ridge of lighted heath, alive, glancing, devouring, would have been a meet emblem of my mind when I accused and menaced Mrs. Reed: the same ridge, black and blasted after the flames are dead, would have represented as meetly my subsequent condition, when half-an-hour’s silence and reflection had shown me the madness of my conduct, and the dreariness of my hated and hating position.\nSomething of vengeance I had tasted for the first time; as aromatic wine it seemed, on swallowing, warm and racy: its after-flavour, metallic and corroding, gave me a sensation as if I had been poisoned. Willingly would I now have gone and asked Mrs. Reed’s pardon; but I knew, partly from experience and partly from instinct, that was the way to make her repulse me with double scorn, thereby re-exciting every turbulent impulse of my nature.\nI would fain exercise some better faculty than that of fierce speaking; fain find nourishment for some less fiendish feeling than that of sombre indignation. I took a book—some Arabian tales; I sat down and endeavoured to read. I could make no sense of the subject; my own thoughts swam always between me and the page I had usually found fascinating. I opened the glass-door in the breakfast-room: the shrubbery was quite still: the black frost reigned, unbroken by sun or breeze, through the grounds. I covered my head and arms with the skirt of my frock, and went out to walk in a part of the plantation which was quite sequestrated; but I found no pleasure in the silent trees, the falling fir-cones, the congealed relics of autumn, russet leaves, swept by past winds in heaps, and now stiffened together. I leaned against a gate, and looked into an empty field where no sheep were feeding, where the short grass was nipped and blanched. It was a very grey day; a most opaque sky, “onding on snaw,” canopied all; thence flakes fell at intervals, which settled on the hard path and on the hoary lea without melting. I stood, a wretched child enough, whispering to myself over and over again, “What shall I do?—what shall I do?”\nAll at once I heard a clear voice call, “Miss Jane! where are you? Come to lunch!”\nIt was Bessie, I knew well enough; but I did not stir; her light step came tripping down the path.\n“You naughty little thing!” she said. “Why don’t you come when you are called?”\nBessie’s presence, compared with the thoughts over which I had been brooding, seemed cheerful; even though, as usual, she was somewhat cross. The fact is, after my conflict with and victory over Mrs. Reed, I was not disposed to care much for the nursemaid’s transitory anger; and I was disposed to bask in her youthful lightness of heart. I just put my two arms round her and said, “Come, Bessie! don’t scold.”\nThe action was more frank and fearless than any I was habituated to indulge in: somehow it pleased her.\n“You are a strange child, Miss Jane,” she said, as she looked down at me; “a little roving, solitary thing: and you are going to school, I suppose?”\nI nodded.\n“And won’t you be sorry to leave poor Bessie?”\n“What does Bessie care for me? She is always scolding me.”\n“Because you’re such a queer, frightened, shy little thing. You should be bolder.”\n“What! to get more knocks?”\n“Nonsense! But you are rather put upon, that’s certain. My mother said, when she came to see me last week, that she would not like a little one of her own to be in your place.—Now, come in, and I’ve some good news for you.”\n“I don’t think you have, Bessie.”\n“Child! what do you mean? What sorrowful eyes you fix on me! Well, but Missis and the young ladies and Master John are going out to tea this afternoon, and you shall have tea with me. I’ll ask cook to bake you a little cake, and then you shall help me to look over your drawers; for I am soon to pack your trunk. Missis intends you to leave Gateshead in a day or two, and you shall choose what toys you like to take with you.”\n“Bessie, you must promise not to scold me any more till I go.”\n“Well, I will; but mind you are a very good girl, and don’t be afraid of me. Don’t start when I chance to speak rather sharply; it’s so provoking.”\n“I don’t think I shall ever be afraid of you again, Bessie, because I have got used to you, and I shall soon have another set of people to dread.”\n“If you dread them they’ll dislike you.”\n“As you do, Bessie?”\n“I don’t dislike you, Miss; I believe I am fonder of you than of all the others.”\n“You don’t show it.”\n“You little sharp thing! you’ve got quite a new way of talking. What makes you so venturesome and hardy?”\n“Why, I shall soon be away from you, and besides”—I was going to say something about what had passed between me and Mrs. Reed, but on second thoughts I considered it better to remain silent on that head.\n“And so you’re glad to leave me?”\n“Not at all, Bessie; indeed, just now I’m rather sorry.”\n“Just now! and rather! How coolly my little lady says it! I dare say now if I were to ask you for a kiss you wouldn’t give it me: you’d say you’d rather not.”\n“I’ll kiss you and welcome: bend your head down.” Bessie stooped; we mutually embraced, and I followed her into the house quite comforted. That afternoon lapsed in peace and harmony; and in the evening Bessie told me some of her most enchanting stories, and sang me some of her sweetest songs. Even for me life had its gleams of sunshine.",
          "paraphrase_gemini-2.5-flash-preview-04-17": "I was left alone, having won the confrontation. It was the toughest struggle I'd ever faced and my initial triumph. I stood for a moment on the rug where Mr. Brocklehurst had stood and savored my isolated victory. Initially, I smiled to myself and felt a surge of elation; however, this intense satisfaction subsided as quickly as my rapid heartbeat returned to normal. A child cannot openly defy their elders as I had done, nor can they unleash their fierce emotions without constraint, as I had done with mine, without subsequently experiencing the pain of regret and the dampening effect of reaction. My state of mind when I was accusing and threatening Mrs. Reed could fittingly be compared to a patch of burning heath, vibrant, flickering, and all-consuming. In contrast, my condition afterwards, when a mere half-hour of quiet and introspection revealed the folly of my actions and the bleakness of my disliked and resentful situation, would have been just as aptly represented by that same patch of heath, now blackened and devastated after the flames had died. I had tasted vengeance for the first time. Initially, it seemed like flavorful wine upon swallowing, warm and sharp; however, its aftertaste was metallic and biting, leaving me with a sensation as if I had been poisoned. I would gladly have gone and asked Mrs. Reed for forgiveness now, but I knew, partly from past experience and partly instinctively, that doing so would only lead her to reject me with increased contempt, thereby reigniting every turbulent impulse within me. I yearned to employ a better capability than sharp words; I yearned to find sustenance for an emotion less malevolent than sullen anger. I picked up a book of Arabian tales; I sat down and attempted to read. I could not make sense of the content; my own thoughts constantly intruded between me and the page I usually found captivating. I opened the glass door in the breakfast room; the shrubbery was completely still. The severe frost held sway, unbroken by sun or breeze, throughout the grounds. I pulled the skirt of my dress over my head and arms and went outside to walk in a very secluded part of the planted area. However, I found no joy in the quiet trees, the fallen pine cones, the frozen remnants of autumn – the reddish-brown leaves swept into piles by past winds and now solidified together. I leaned against a gate and looked into an empty field where no sheep were grazing, where the short grass was bitten and pale. It was a very grey day; a dense sky, threatening snow, covered everything. Occasional snowflakes fell from it, landing on the hard path and the pale, frosted field without melting. I stood there, quite a miserable child, whispering to myself repeatedly, \"What should I do? What should I do?\" Suddenly, I heard a clear voice call, \"Miss Jane! Where are you? Come to lunch!\" I knew perfectly well it was Bessie, but I didn't move. Her light steps came quickly down the path. \"You naughty little thing!\" she exclaimed. \"Why don't you come when you are called?\" Bessie's presence, when contrasted with the brooding thoughts I had been dwelling on, seemed cheerful, even though, as usual, she was somewhat irritable. The truth was, after my conflict with and victory over Mrs. Reed, I was not inclined to mind the nursemaid's fleeting irritation; instead, I was inclined to enjoy her youthful cheerfulness. I simply put my arms around her and said, \"Come, Bessie! Don't scold.\" This action was more open and courageous than any I was accustomed to performing; for some reason, it pleased her. \"You are a peculiar child, Miss Jane,\" she remarked, looking down at me. \"A little wandering, solitary creature. And you are going to school, I presume?\" I nodded. \"And you won't be sad to leave poor Bessie?\" \"What does Bessie care about me? She is always scolding me.\" \"Because you're such an odd, timid, shy little thing. You ought to be bolder.\" \"What! To get more blows?\" \"Nonsense! But you are rather picked on, that's for sure. My mother said, when she visited me last week, that she would not want one of her own little ones to be in your situation. Now, come inside, and I have some good news for you.\" \"I don't believe you do, Bessie.\" \"Child! What do you mean? Why do you fix such sad eyes on me? Well, the mistress and the young ladies and Master John are going out for tea this afternoon, and you shall have tea with me. I'll ask the cook to bake you a small cake, and then you can help me sort through your drawers because I have to pack your trunk soon. The mistress intends for you to leave Gateshead in a day or two, and you can choose which toys you'd like to take with you.\" \"Bessie, you must promise not to scold me anymore until I leave.\" \"Alright, I will; but remember, you must be a very good girl and don't be afraid of me. Don't jump when I happen to speak rather sharply; it's so irritating.\" \"I don't think I shall ever be afraid of you again, Bessie, because I have become used to you, and I shall soon have a different group of people to fear.\" \"If you fear them, they'll dislike you.\" \"Just as you do, Bessie?\" \"I don't dislike you, Miss; I believe I am fonder of you than of all the others.\" \"You don't show it.\" \"You sharp little thing! You have developed a completely new way of talking. What makes you so daring and firm?\" \"Well, I shall soon be away from you, and besides\"—I was about to say something about what had transpired between me and Mrs. Reed, but on second thought, I decided it was better to remain quiet on that matter. \"And so you're happy to leave me?\" \"Not at all, Bessie; in fact, right now I'm rather regretful.\" \"Right now! And rather! How coolly my little lady expresses it! I dare say now if I were to ask you for a kiss, you wouldn't give it to me; you'd say you'd prefer not to.\" \"I'll kiss you readily; bend your head down.\" Bessie stooped; we hugged one another, and I followed her into the house feeling quite comforted. That afternoon passed peacefully and harmoniously; and in the evening, Bessie recounted some of her most captivating stories and sang me some of her most beautiful songs. Even for me, life had its brief moments of happiness.",
          "paraphrase_gpt-4.1-2025-04-14": "Left alone after my confrontation, I felt like I had won a difficult battle—the hardest I’d ever faced, and my first true victory. I stood for a moment in the very spot where Mr. Brocklehurst had been, savoring my moment of triumph. At first, I felt a surge of pride and joy, but the intensity faded just as quickly as my racing heartbeat returned to normal. Children aren’t supposed to fight with their elders or let their anger loose as I did, and afterward, regret and a sense of emptiness took over. My mind, while I was accusing Mrs. Reed, was like a burning, lively heath; but after some time had passed, it felt more like that same heath after the fire had gone out—black and barren. A half-hour of silence made me realize how rash my actions had been, and I was left with the loneliness of my unhappy situation. I had tasted a kind of revenge for the first time; it seemed exciting at first, but its lasting effect was bitter and corrosive, as if I had swallowed poison. I wanted to ask Mrs. Reed to forgive me, but I knew from experience and instinct that she would only respond with more contempt, which would make me angry again. I wished I could focus on something better than angry words and nurture kinder feelings than anger, so I tried to read a book of Arabian tales. But I couldn’t concentrate—my thoughts kept wandering. I went outside into the cold, frosty yard where everything was quiet, covered my head and arms with my dress, and wandered to a secluded part of the garden. The silent trees, fallen fir-cones, and frozen leaves gave me no comfort. I stood by a gate looking into an empty, gray, snow-dusted field, feeling miserable, asking myself over and over, \"What shall I do?\" Suddenly, I heard Bessie calling for me to come to lunch. I didn’t move, but she soon found me, chiding me playfully. Compared to my brooding, Bessie seemed cheerful, even if she was a little annoyed. After standing up to Mrs. Reed, I didn’t care much about Bessie’s scolding, and I found comfort in her friendly presence. I hugged her and asked her not to scold me, which pleased her. She commented on how unusual I was, guessing I’d be going away to school soon. When she asked if I’d miss her, I said she was always scolding me, but she told me to be braver. We talked a little more, and she brightened things by inviting me to have tea with her later, promising a treat and letting me choose which toys to pack when I left Gateshead. I made her promise not to scold me anymore, and she agreed, telling me not to fear her. I replied that I probably wouldn’t be scared of her again since I was used to her, and soon I’d have new people to worry about. She advised me not to be fearful, saying if I was, people might dislike me. When I asked if she disliked me, she said she was actually fonder of me than anyone else, though I told her she didn’t show it. She teased me about my boldness, and I explained that it was because I’d soon be leaving. She asked if I was happy to be going, but I honestly said I was a bit sorry at that moment. She joked about my cool tone and asked for a kiss—I gladly gave her one, and we warmed to each other. I went back inside with her, comforted, and spent a peaceful afternoon. That evening, she told me stories and sang songs, and I realized that even for me, there were moments of happiness in life."

I had risen half-an-hour before her entrance, and had washed my face, and put on my clothes by the light of a half-moon just setting, whose rays streamed through the narrow window near my crib. I was to leave Gateshead that day by a coach which passed the lodge gates at six A.M. Bessie was the only person yet risen; she had lit a fire in the nursery, where she now proceeded to make my breakfast. Few children can eat when excited with the thoughts of a journey; nor could I. Bessie, having pressed me in vain to take a few spoonfuls of the boiled milk and bread she had prepared for me, wrapped up some biscuits in a paper and put them into my bag; then she helped me on with my pelisse and bonnet, and wrapping herself in a shawl, she and I left the nursery. As we passed Mrs. Reed’s bedroom, she said, “Will you go in and bid Missis good-bye?”\n“No, Bessie: she came to my crib last night when you were gone down to supper, and said I need not disturb her in the morning, or my cousins either; and she told me to remember that she had always been my best friend, and to speak of her and be grateful to her accordingly.”\n“What did you say, Miss?”\n“Nothing: I covered my face with the bedclothes, and turned from her to the wall.”\n“That was wrong, Miss Jane.”\n“It was quite right, Bessie. Your Missis has not been my friend: she has been my foe.”\n“O Miss Jane! don’t say so!”\n“Good-bye to Gateshead!” cried I, as we passed through the hall and went out at the front door.\nThe moon was set, and it was very dark; Bessie carried a lantern, whose light glanced on wet steps and gravel road sodden by a recent thaw. Raw and chill was the winter morning: my teeth chattered as I hastened down the drive. There was a light in the porter’s lodge: when we reached it, we found the porter’s wife just kindling her fire: my trunk, which had been carried down the evening before, stood corded at the door. It wanted but a few minutes of six, and shortly after that hour had struck, the distant roll of wheels announced the coming coach; I went to the door and watched its lamps approach rapidly through the gloom.\n“Is she going by herself?” asked the porter’s wife.\n“Yes.”\n“And how far is it?”\n“Fifty miles.”\n“What a long way! I wonder Mrs. Reed is not afraid to trust her so far alone.”\nThe coach drew up; there it was at the gates with its four horses and its top laden with passengers: the guard and coachman loudly urged haste; my trunk was hoisted up; I was taken from Bessie’s neck, to which I clung with kisses.\n“Be sure and take good care of her,” cried she to the guard, as he lifted me into the inside.\n“Ay, ay!” was the answer: the door was slapped to, a voice exclaimed “All right,” and on we drove. Thus was I severed from Bessie and Gateshead; thus whirled away to unknown, and, as I then deemed, remote and mysterious regions.",
          "paraphrase_gemini-2.5-flash-preview-04-17": "Around five o'clock on the morning of January 19th, Bessie entered my small room with a candle, discovering I was already awake and almost dressed. I had gotten up thirty minutes earlier and used the light from a half-moon, visible through the narrow window by my bed, to wash and dress. That day, I was scheduled to leave Gateshead on a coach that would pass the main gates at 6 AM. Bessie was the only other person awake; she had lit a fire in the nursery and was preparing my breakfast there. I was too excited about the journey to eat much, which is typical for children in such situations. Bessie tried to persuade me to eat some of the boiled milk and bread she had made, but when I couldn't, she wrapped some biscuits in paper for my bag. She helped me put on my coat and bonnet, then, wrapping a shawl around herself, we left the nursery. As we walked past Mrs. Reed's bedroom, she asked if I wanted to go in and say goodbye. I refused, explaining that Mrs. Reed had visited my bedside the previous evening after Bessie had gone down for supper and told me not to disturb her or my cousins in the morning. She had also instructed me to remember her as my greatest supporter and to speak of her and be grateful accordingly. Bessie asked how I had responded. I said I hadn't; I had just pulled the covers over my face and turned away from her towards the wall. Bessie thought this was wrong, but I insisted it was right, stating that Mrs. Reed had not been a friend but an enemy. Bessie objected, saying 'Oh, Miss Jane! Don't say that!' As we went through the hall and out the front door, I exclaimed, 'Goodbye to Gateshead!' The moon had set, and it was very dark. Bessie carried a lantern whose light shone on the wet steps and the gravel path, softened by the recent thaw. The winter morning was raw and cold, causing my teeth to chatter as I hurried down the drive. There was a light on in the porter's lodge, and when we reached it, we found the porter's wife starting her fire. My trunk, which had been brought down the night before, stood tied up by the door. It was only a few minutes before six, and shortly after the hour struck, the distant sound of rolling wheels signaled the approaching coach. I went to the door and watched its lamps quickly appear out of the darkness. The porter's wife asked if I was traveling alone, and Bessie confirmed I was, stating the distance was fifty miles. 'What a distance!' exclaimed the porter's wife, 'I'm surprised Mrs. Reed isn't afraid to trust her alone so far.' The coach pulled up to the gates, with its four horses and a top full of passengers. The guard and coachman were urging haste. My trunk was loaded, and I clung to Bessie, kissing her neck before being taken from her. As the guard lifted me inside, she called out to him, 'Make sure you take good care of her!' 'Alright!' he replied. The door was shut quickly, a voice called out 'All right,' and we began to move. In this way, I was separated from Bessie and Gateshead, swiftly carried away to places I didn't know, which at the time seemed distant and mysterious to me.",
          "paraphrase_gpt-4.1-2025-04-14": "It was just after five in the morning on January 19th when Bessie entered my small room with a candle and found me already awake and nearly dressed. I had gotten up half an hour before she arrived, washed my face, and put on my clothes by the remaining moonlight coming through the window near my bed. I was set to leave Gateshead that day on a coach scheduled to pass the lodge gates at six o'clock. At that hour, Bessie was the only other person awake; she had made a fire in the nursery and was now preparing my breakfast there. Excitement over the trip took away my appetite, as is often the case with children, and I could not eat. Bessie tried to persuade me to take a few spoonfuls of the milk and bread she’d made, but when I refused, she wrapped some biscuits in paper and placed them in my bag. She helped me into my coat and hat, wrapped herself in a shawl, and together we left the nursery. As we neared Mrs. Reed’s bedroom, Bessie asked if I wanted to say goodbye, but I declined, explaining that Mrs. Reed had visited me the night before while Bessie was at supper, telling me not to disturb her or my cousins in the morning and reminding me to always speak well of her and be grateful. Bessie asked how I had responded, and I told her I had simply hidden my face and turned away, insisting that Mrs. Reed had not been a friend to me but an enemy, though Bessie protested this. Passing through the house, I called out goodbye to Gateshead. It was still dark and cold, the moon had set, and Bessie carried a lantern as we went over wet steps and a soggy gravel path from the thaw. I shivered in the winter air as we hurried down the driveway. When we arrived at the porter’s lodge, his wife was starting her fire and my trunk was already waiting, having been brought down the previous evening. It was almost six o’clock when we heard the approaching coach. I watched its lamps grow brighter through the darkness as it came near. The porter’s wife asked if I was traveling alone and how far I had to go, and was surprised that Mrs. Reed would send me off by myself for fifty miles. When the coach arrived with its four horses and crowded roof, the guard and coachman hurried everyone along. My trunk was loaded up, and I hugged Bessie tightly before being lifted into the coach. She asked the guard to look after me, and after he agreed, the door closed, and the coach set off. This was how I was separated from Bessie and Gateshead and carried off toward places that seemed to me distant and mysterious."

We passed through several towns, and in one, a very large one, the coach stopped; the horses were taken out, and the passengers alighted to dine. I was carried into an inn, where the guard wanted me to have some dinner; but, as I had no appetite, he left me in an immense room with a fireplace at each end, a chandelier pendent from the ceiling, and a little red gallery high up against the wall filled with musical instruments. Here I walked about for a long time, feeling very strange, and mortally apprehensive of some one coming in and kidnapping me; for I believed in kidnappers, their exploits having frequently figured in Bessie’s fireside chronicles. At last the guard returned; once more I was stowed away in the coach, my protector mounted his own seat, sounded his hollow horn, and away we rattled over the “stony street” of L——.\nThe afternoon came on wet and somewhat misty: as it waned into dusk, I began to feel that we were getting very far indeed from Gateshead: we ceased to pass through towns; the country changed; great grey hills heaved up round the horizon: as twilight deepened, we descended a valley, dark with wood, and long after night had overclouded the prospect, I heard a wild wind rushing amongst trees.\nLulled by the sound, I at last dropped asleep; I had not long slumbered when the sudden cessation of motion awoke me; the coach-door was open, and a person like a servant was standing at it: I saw her face and dress by the light of the lamps.\n“Is there a little girl called Jane Eyre here?” she asked.

We journeyed through several towns, and in one sizable place, the stagecoach paused. The horses were unhitched, and the passengers got off to dine. I was led into an inn where the guard suggested I eat, but lacking appetite, he left me in an enormous room. This room had a fireplace at each end, a large chandelier hanging from the ceiling, and a small, high red gallery along one wall containing musical instruments. I spent a long time walking around in this room, feeling very strange and intensely worried that someone might come in and kidnap me, a fear based on Bessie's frequent stories about kidnappers' deeds. Eventually, the guard returned. I was helped back into the coach, my protector took his position, blew his horn, and we rattled away through the stone streets of L——. The afternoon became damp and slightly misty; as it faded into twilight, I started to feel we were getting quite far from Gateshead. We stopped passing through towns; the landscape changed, with large grey hills rising around the horizon. As darkness deepened, we descended into a valley thick with woods, and long after night had obscured the view, I heard a wild wind sweeping through the trees. The sound lulled me, and I finally fell asleep. I hadn't slept long when I was woken by the coach stopping abruptly. The coach door was open, and a person who appeared to be a servant was standing there. The light from the lamps showed me her face and clothing. \"Is there a little girl called Jane Eyre here?\" she asked. I replied \"Yes,\" and she then lifted me out.

I was brought into an inn, where the guard encouraged me to have some lunch, but I didn’t feel hungry. He left me alone in a huge room with fireplaces at both ends, a ceiling chandelier, and a small red gallery high on the wall filled with musical instruments. I wandered around this room for quite some time, feeling uneasy and fearful someone might come in and abduct me, as Bessie’s stories had made me believe in kidnappers. Eventually, the guard came back; I was put back in the coach, he took his seat, blew his horn, and we continued rattling through the stony streets of L——.\n\nLater, it began to rain and mist settled in as afternoon turned to evening. As it grew dark, I sensed that we were getting farther and farther from Gateshead. We stopped passing through towns, the scenery changed, and gray hills appeared around us. At dusk, we went down into a wooded valley, and after night fell, I could hear a wild wind blowing through the trees.\n\nSoothed by the sound, I finally fell asleep, but was soon awakened when the coach stopped. The door opened and a woman, looking like a servant, stood there. I could see her face and dress in the lamplight. She asked if there was a girl named Jane Eyre, and when I said yes, I was lifted out, my luggage handed to me, and the coach drove away."

Rain, wind, and darkness filled the air; nevertheless, I dimly discerned a wall before me and a door open in it; through this door I passed with my new guide: she shut and locked it behind her. There was now visible a house or houses—for the building spread far—with many windows, and lights burning in some; we went up a broad pebbly path, splashing wet, and were admitted at a door; then the servant led me through a passage into a room with a fire, where she left me alone.\nI stood and warmed my numbed fingers over the blaze, then I looked round; there was no candle, but the uncertain light from the hearth showed, by intervals, papered walls, carpet, curtains, shining mahogany furniture: it was a parlour, not so spacious or splendid as the drawing-room at Gateshead, but comfortable enough. I was puzzling to make out the subject of a picture on the wall, when the door opened, and an individual carrying a light entered; another followed close behind.\nThe first was a tall lady with dark hair, dark eyes, and a pale and large forehead; her figure was partly enveloped in a shawl, her countenance was grave, her bearing erect.\n“The child is very young to be sent alone,” said she, putting her candle down on the table. She considered me attentively for a minute or two, then further added—\n“She had better be put to bed soon; she looks tired: are you tired?” she asked, placing her hand on my shoulder.\n“A little, ma’am.”\n“And hungry too, no doubt: let her have some supper before she goes to bed, Miss Miller. Is this the first time you have left your parents to come to school, my little girl?”\nI explained to her that I had no parents. She inquired how long they had been dead: then how old I was, what was my name, whether I could read, write, and sew a little: then she touched my cheek gently with her forefinger, and saying, “She hoped I should be a good child,” dismissed me along with Miss Miller.\nThe lady I had left might be about twenty-nine; the one who went with me appeared some years younger: the first impressed me by her voice, look, and air.

Rain, wind, and darkness filled the air, but I could dimly see a wall in front of me with an open door. I went through this door with the person guiding me; she closed and locked it after us. Now I could see a building, or perhaps several connected buildings, stretching far with many windows, some showing lights. We walked up a wide, wet, pebbly path and entered through a door. The servant then led me down a corridor into a room with a fire, where I remained by myself. I stood and warmed my cold fingers at the fire, then I surveyed the room. There was no candle, but the flickering firelight occasionally revealed wallpaper, a carpet, curtains, and polished mahogany furniture. It was a parlour, not as large or grand as the drawing-room at Gateshead, but comfortable. I was trying to figure out what a picture on the wall depicted when the door opened and someone carrying a light entered, followed closely by another person. The first was a tall lady with dark hair, dark eyes, and a pale, broad forehead. A shawl partly covered her figure; her expression was serious, and her posture upright. \"The child is very young to travel alone,\" she said, setting her candle on the table. She studied me carefully for a couple of minutes, then added, \"She should probably go to bed soon; she looks tired. Are you tired?\" she asked, placing her hand on my shoulder. \"A little, ma'am.\" \"And hungry too, I'm sure. Let her have some supper before bed, Miss Miller. Is this the first time you've left your parents to come to school, my little girl?\" I explained that I had no parents.

The lady I had just left was likely around twenty-nine years old; the one accompanying me seemed younger by several years. The first lady made an impression on me with her voice, look, and demeanor. Miss Miller was plainer; she had a ruddy complexion but a tired-looking face, and she moved and acted quickly, like someone who always had many tasks to handle.

The portions were handed round; those who liked took a draught of the water, the mug being common to all.

We eventually emerged from the complete and rather bleak silence that had filled the part of the house we had just passed through, and encountered the low drone of many voices. Soon after, we entered a wide, elongated room. This room contained large tables, with two placed at each end, on which a pair of candles burned. Seated all around on benches was a group of girls of all ages, from around nine or ten up to twenty. In the dim candlelight, their number seemed immense to me, although there were actually no more than eighty. They were uniformly dressed in old-fashioned brown fabric dresses and long white aprons. It was study time; they were occupied with memorizing their lessons for the following day, and the buzzing sound I'd heard was the collective result of their quiet repetitions. Miss Miller indicated for me to sit on a bench near the door. Then, walking to the end of the long room, she called out, \"Monitors, collect the lesson books and put them away!\" Four tall girls stood up from different tables and went around gathering the books before removing them. Miss Miller then issued another command: \"Monitors, fetch the supper trays!\" The tall girls left and returned shortly, each carrying a tray holding servings of something I didn't recognize, along with a pitcher of water and a mug in the center of each tray. The portions were passed out. Those who wished to drink took some water using the common mug. When it was my turn, I drank, as I was thirsty, but I didn't touch the food. Excitement and exhaustion made me unable to eat. I did, however, then see that it was a thin oatcake broken into pieces. After the meal, Miss Miller read prayers, and the classes exited the room, filing upstairs in pairs. By now, overcome with tiredness, I hardly noticed what the bedroom looked like, except that it was very long, similar to the schoolroom. That night, I was assigned to be Miss Miller's bedmate; she assisted me in undressing. Once I was in bed, I looked at the long rows of beds, each of which was quickly filled by two occupants. Within ten minutes, the only light was put out, and surrounded by silence and complete darkness, I fell asleep.",

She then instructed the monitors to bring in the supper trays. The same girls left and returned with trays carrying portions of an unknown food and pitchers of water. The food was passed around, as was a shared mug for water. When it was my turn, I drank some water since I was thirsty, but I didn't eat the food due to my exhaustion and excitement; I soon realized it was just thin oatcake broken into pieces. After supper, Miss Miller read prayers and the girls left the room in pairs to go upstairs. I was so tired that I barely noticed the dormitory, except for its length, and tonight I was to share a bed with Miss Miller.

I too rose reluctantly; it was bitter cold, and I dressed as well as I could for shivering, and washed when there was a basin at liberty, which did not occur soon, as there was but one basin to six girls, on the stands down the middle of the room. Again the bell rang: all formed in file, two and two, and in that order descended the stairs and entered the cold and dimly lit schoolroom: here prayers were read by Miss Miller; afterwards she called out—\n“Form classes!”\nA great tumult succeeded for some minutes, during which Miss Miller repeatedly exclaimed, “Silence!” and “Order!” When it subsided, I saw them all drawn up in four semicircles, before four chairs, placed at the four tables; all held books in their hands, and a great book, like a Bible, lay on each table, before the vacant seat. A pause of some seconds succeeded, filled up by the low, vague hum of numbers; Miss Miller walked from class to class, hushing this indefinite sound.\nA distant bell tinkled: immediately three ladies entered the room, each walked to a table and took her seat; Miss Miller assumed the fourth vacant chair, which was that nearest the door, and around which the smallest of the children were assembled: to this inferior class I was called, and placed at the bottom of it.\nBusiness now began: the day’s Collect was repeated, then certain texts of Scripture were said, and to these succeeded a protracted reading of chapters in the Bible, which lasted an hour. By the time that exercise was terminated, day had fully dawned. The indefatigable bell now sounded for the fourth time: the classes were marshalled and marched into another room to breakfast: how glad I was to behold a prospect of getting something to eat! I was now nearly sick from inanition, having taken so little the day before.\nThe refectory was a great, low-ceiled, gloomy room; on two long tables smoked basins of something hot, which, however, to my dismay, sent forth an odour far from inviting. I saw a universal manifestation of discontent when the fumes of the repast met the nostrils of those destined to swallow it; from the van of the procession, the tall girls of the first class, rose the whispered words—\n“Disgusting! The porridge is burnt again!”\n“Silence!” ejaculated a voice; not that of Miss Miller, but one of the upper teachers, a little and dark personage, smartly dressed, but of somewhat morose aspect, who installed herself at the top of one table, while a more buxom lady presided at the other. I looked in vain for her I had first seen the night before; she was not visible: Miss Miller occupied the foot of the table where I sat, and a strange, foreign-looking, elderly lady, the French teacher, as I afterwards found, took the corresponding seat at the other board. A long grace was said and a hymn sung; then a servant brought in some tea for the teachers, and the meal began.\nRavenous, and now very faint, I devoured a spoonful or two of my portion without thinking of its taste; but the first edge of hunger blunted, I perceived I had got in hand a nauseous mess; burnt porridge is almost as bad as rotten potatoes; famine itself soon sickens over it. The spoons were moved slowly: I saw each girl taste her food and try to swallow it; but in most cases the effort was soon relinquished. Breakfast was over, and none had breakfasted. Thanks being returned for what we had not got, and a second hymn chanted, the refectory was evacuated for the schoolroom. I was one of the last to go out, and in passing the tables, I saw one teacher take a basin of the porridge and taste it; she looked at the others; all their countenances expressed displeasure, and one of them, the stout one, whispered—\n“Abominable stuff!",
          "paraphrase_gemini-2.5-flash-preview-04-17": "The night went quickly. I was too exhausted to even dream, waking only once to the sound of strong wind gusts and pouring rain, realizing that Miss Miller was now sleeping next to me. When I opened my eyes again, a loud bell was ringing; the other girls were awake and getting dressed. It wasn't quite dawn yet, and a couple of small lights (rushlights) were burning in the room. I got up unwillingly because it was very cold. I shivered while getting dressed as best I could and washed whenever a basin became available, which wasn't often since there was only one basin for six girls on the stands in the middle of the room. The bell rang again; everyone lined up in pairs and went down the stairs into the cold, dimly lit schoolroom. Miss Miller led prayers there, and then she announced, \"Form your classes!\" For several minutes, there was a lot of noise, with Miss Miller repeatedly calling for \"Silence!\" and \"Order!\" Once things settled down, I saw everyone arranged in four half-circles in front of four chairs by four tables. Each girl had a book, and a large book, like a Bible, was placed on each table in front of the empty seat. A few seconds of quiet followed, filled only by the low, indistinct murmur of voices counting or reciting; Miss Miller walked among the groups, trying to quiet this general sound. A faraway bell chimed, and immediately three ladies entered the room. Each went to a table and sat down. Miss Miller took the fourth empty chair, which was the one closest to the door and around which the youngest children were gathered. I was called to join this lowest class and placed at the very back of it. The day's activities began. We recited the daily Collect, then some Bible verses, followed by a long session of reading Bible chapters, which lasted for an hour. By the time this reading finished, it was fully daylight. The persistent bell rang for the fourth time, and the classes were organized and marched into another room for breakfast. How relieved I was to see the possibility of getting something to eat! I felt almost ill from hunger, having eaten so little the previous day. The dining hall (refectory) was a large, low-ceilinged, gloomy room. On two long tables, there were steaming bowls of a hot dish which, unfortunately and to my disappointment, smelled quite unappetizing. I saw widespread expressions of displeasure as the smell of the food reached the girls who were supposed to eat it. From the front of the line, the older girls in the first class, came quiet whispers: \"Horrible! The porridge is burned again!\" A voice sharply ordered, \"Silence!\" It wasn't Miss Miller's, but that of one of the senior teachers, a small, dark woman who was smartly dressed but looked rather stern. She took her place at the head of one table, while a more cheerful-looking lady presided over the other. I looked around for the teacher I had seen first the night before, but she wasn't there. Miss Miller sat at the foot of the table where I was placed, and an elderly, unfamiliar-looking lady, who I later learned was the French teacher, occupied the corresponding seat at the other table. A lengthy grace was said, followed by a hymn being sung. Then, a servant brought tea for the teachers, and the meal started. Extremely hungry and now feeling very weak, I ate a spoonful or two of my portion without paying attention to the taste. But once the initial intense hunger lessened, I realized I was eating a disgusting mess. Burnt porridge is nearly as bad as rotten potatoes; even starvation makes one sick of it quickly. Spoons moved slowly; I watched each girl taste her food and try to swallow it, but in most cases, they soon gave up. Breakfast was over, and practically no one had eaten. After giving thanks for the meal we didn't get and singing another hymn, we left the refectory for the schoolroom. I was among the last to leave, and as I passed the tables, I saw one teacher sample a bowl of the porridge. She looked at the others; they all looked displeased, and one of them, the heavier-set one, muttered, \"Awful stuff!\"",
          "paraphrase_gpt-4.1-2025-04-14": "The night went by quickly; I was so exhausted that I didn't even dream. I only woke up once, hearing the wind howling fiercely and rain pouring down, and realized that Miss Miller had come to lie beside me. When I next opened my eyes, a loud bell was sounding and the girls were already getting up and dressing, even though it wasn't yet dawn and only a few rushlights were lit. I got up too, reluctantly; it was terribly cold, and I tried to get dressed while shivering. I washed as soon as a basin was free, but since there was only one basin for every six girls placed in the middle of the room, I had to wait. The bell rang again: we lined up in pairs and went downstairs in order to the chilly, dimly lit schoolroom. Miss Miller read prayers, then called out for us to form classes. The room became chaotic for a few minutes, during which Miss Miller kept calling for silence and order. Once it quieted down, I saw everyone arranged in four semicircles around four tables with empty chairs, each chair before a big book that looked like a Bible. The girls held small books in their hands. There was a short pause filled with the low hum of voices; Miss Miller walked from group to group, quieting us. A bell rang at a distance and three ladies entered; each sat at a table, with Miss Miller taking the fourth chair by the door and overseeing the youngest children, including me, who was placed at the end. Our lessons began: we recited the day’s prayer, then some Bible verses, followed by a long reading from the Bible that lasted an hour. By the time this ended, daylight had fully arrived. The bell sounded again for the fourth time, and we formed lines to go to breakfast. I was eager for food, since I'd had very little the day before and felt sick with hunger. The dining room was a large, gloomy space with low ceilings; on two long tables were steaming bowls of food that smelled unappetizing. I noticed everyone looked unhappy as soon as they caught the scent; I heard the older girls at the front whisper, 'Disgusting! The porridge is burnt again!' 'Silence!' snapped a voice—not Miss Miller, but another stern teacher, who sat at the head of one table, while a more cheerful lady took the other. The teacher I’d seen the previous night wasn't there; Miss Miller sat at my table’s end, and an older, foreign-looking woman, who turned out to be the French teacher, was at the other. We said a long grace and sang a hymn; then a servant brought tea for the teachers, and breakfast began. Starving and weak, I ate a few spoonfuls quickly, not caring about the taste at first, but soon realized the food was dreadful—burnt porridge, hardly better than spoiled potatoes. Even hunger couldn't make it palatable. The girls ate slowly, many giving up after just a taste. Soon breakfast was over, but hardly anyone had eaten. We gave thanks for the meal we hadn't really received and sang another hymn. The room emptied back into the schoolroom. As I left, I saw a teacher taste the porridge; exchanging looks with the others, their faces all showed displeasure, and the plumper teacher whispered, 'Horrible stuff!\""

          "text_segment": "A quarter of an hour passed before lessons again began, during which the schoolroom was in a glorious tumult; for that space of time it seemed to be permitted to talk loud and more freely, and they used their privilege. The whole conversation ran on the breakfast, which one and all abused roundly. Poor things! it was the sole consolation they had. Miss Miller was now the only teacher in the room: a group of great girls standing about her spoke with serious and sullen gestures. I heard the name of Mr. Brocklehurst pronounced by some lips; at which Miss Miller shook her head disapprovingly; but she made no great effort to check the general wrath; doubtless she shared in it.\nA clock in the schoolroom struck nine; Miss Miller left her circle, and standing in the middle of the room, cried—\n“Silence! To your seats!”\nDiscipline prevailed: in five minutes the confused throng was resolved into order, and comparative silence quelled the Babel clamour of tongues. The upper teachers now punctually resumed their posts: but still, all seemed to wait. Ranged on benches down the sides of the room, the eighty girls sat motionless and erect; a quaint assemblage they appeared, all with plain locks combed from their faces, not a curl visible; in brown dresses, made high and surrounded by a narrow tucker about the throat, with little pockets of holland (shaped something like a Highlander’s purse) tied in front of their frocks, and destined to serve the purpose of a work-bag: all, too, wearing woollen stockings and country-made shoes, fastened with brass buckles. Above twenty of those clad in this costume were full-grown girls, or rather young women; it suited them ill, and gave an air of oddity even to the prettiest.\nI was still looking at them, and also at intervals examining the teachers—none of whom precisely pleased me; for the stout one was a little coarse, the dark one not a little fierce, the foreigner harsh and grotesque, and Miss Miller, poor thing! looked purple, weather-beaten, and over-worked—when, as my eye wandered from face to face, the whole school rose simultaneously, as if moved by a common spring.\nWhat was the matter? I had heard no order given: I was puzzled. Ere I had gathered my wits, the classes were again seated: but as all eyes were now turned to one point, mine followed the general direction, and encountered the personage who had received me last night. She stood at the bottom of the long room, on the hearth; for there was a fire at each end; she surveyed the two rows of girls silently and gravely. Miss Miller approaching, seemed to ask her a question, and having received her answer, went back to her place, and said aloud—\n“Monitor of the first class, fetch the globes!”\nWhile the direction was being executed, the lady consulted moved slowly up the room. I suppose I have a considerable organ of veneration, for I retain yet the sense of admiring awe with which my eyes traced her steps. Seen now, in broad daylight, she looked tall, fair, and shapely; brown eyes with a benignant light in their irids, and a fine pencilling of long lashes round, relieved the whiteness of her large front; on each of her temples her hair, of a very dark brown, was clustered in round curls, according to the fashion of those times, when neither smooth bands nor long ringlets were in vogue; her dress, also in the mode of the day, was of purple cloth, relieved by a sort of Spanish trimming of black velvet; a gold watch (watches were not so common then as now) shone at her girdle. Let the reader add, to complete the picture, refined features; a complexion, if pale, clear; and a stately air and carriage, and he will have, at least, as clearly as words can give it, a correct idea of the exterior of Miss Temple—Maria Temple, as I afterwards saw the name written in a prayer-book intrusted to me to carry to church.\nThe superintendent of Lowood (for such was this lady) having taken her seat before a pair of globes placed on one of the tables, summoned the first class round her, and commenced giving a lesson on geography; the lower classes were called by the teachers: repetitions in history, grammar, &c., went on for an hour; writing and arithmetic succeeded, and music lessons were given by Miss Temple to some of the elder girls. The duration of each lesson was measured by the clock, which at last struck twelve. The superintendent rose—\n“I have a word to address to the pupils,” said she.\nThe tumult of cessation from lessons was already breaking forth, but it sank at her voice. She went on—\n“You had this morning a breakfast which you could not eat; you must be hungry:—I have ordered that a lunch of bread and cheese shall be served to all.”\nThe teachers looked at her with a sort of surprise.\n“It is to be done on my responsibility,” she added, in an explanatory tone to them, and immediately afterwards left the room.\nThe bread and cheese was presently brought in and distributed, to the high delight and refreshment of the whole school.",
          "paraphrase_gemini-2.5-flash-preview-04-17": "A quarter of an hour elapsed before the next lessons started, during which the schoolroom was filled with loud noise and excitement. For that brief period, they seemed allowed to speak loudly and more openly, a privilege they fully utilized. Their entire conversation revolved around the morning meal, which everyone sharply criticized. They were poor girls, and complaining about the breakfast was their only comfort. Only Miss Miller was present as a teacher in the room; several older girls stood around her, speaking with serious, unhappy expressions. I overheard someone mention Mr. Brocklehurst's name, causing Miss Miller to shake her head disapprovingly, but she didn't try hard to stop the widespread anger, likely because she felt the same way.The schoolroom clock struck nine. Miss Miller left the group, stood in the center of the room, and called out, 'Silence! Take your seats!' Order quickly returned. Within five minutes, the chaotic crowd had settled down, and relative quiet replaced the noisy chatter. The senior teachers then promptly returned to their positions, but everyone still seemed to be waiting. The eighty girls sat straight and still on benches lining the room. They presented an unusual sight, all with their simple hair combed back from their faces, not a single curl visible; they wore brown dresses with high necks and a small collar, and little bags made of canvas (resembling a Highlander's pouch) tied in front of their dresses to serve as work-bags. They all also wore woollen socks and country-made shoes fastened with brass buckles. Over twenty of these girls in uniform were fully grown, or young women; the clothing didn't suit them and made even the most attractive ones look peculiar.I continued observing them, occasionally glancing at the teachers – none of whom I found particularly appealing; the plump one seemed a bit rough, the dark one rather harsh, the foreign teacher looked unpleasant and strange, and poor Miss Miller appeared red-faced, weathered, and exhausted – when, as my gaze moved from face to face, the entire school stood up simultaneously, as if activated by a single mechanism.What was happening? I hadn't heard any command given and felt bewildered. Before I could collect my thoughts, the classes were seated again. But since everyone's eyes were now fixed on one spot, mine followed the general direction and landed on the person who had received me the previous evening. She stood at the end of the long room by the hearth; there was a fire at both ends. She silently and seriously surveyed the two lines of girls. Miss Miller approached her, seemingly asking a question, and after getting an answer, went back to her place and announced loudly, 'Monitor of the first class, bring the globes!'While this instruction was being carried out, the lady consulted slowly moved up the room. I believe I have a strong capacity for reverence, as I still feel the sense of admiring awe with which my eyes followed her movements. Seen now in full daylight, she appeared tall, fair, and well-proportioned; brown eyes with a gentle light in their pupils, surrounded by a delicate fringe of long lashes, softened the fairness of her broad forehead; on each temple, her very dark brown hair was styled in round clusters of curls, following the fashion of that era, when smooth hair or long hanging curls were not in style; her dress, also in the current mode, was of purple cloth, adorned with a kind of Spanish-style black velvet trim; a gold watch (watches were less common then than now) gleamed at her waist. To complete the image, the reader should imagine refined features, a clear complexion though pale, and a dignified bearing and posture. With these details, one can form, as accurately as words allow, a correct picture of Miss Temple's appearance – Maria Temple, as I later saw her name written in a prayer-book I was given to carry to church.The superintendent of Lowood (as this lady was) took her seat before a pair of globes placed on a table and called the first class around her, beginning a geography lesson. The lower classes were called by their teachers; repetitions in history, grammar, and so on, continued for an hour; writing and arithmetic followed, and Miss Temple gave music lessons to some of the older girls. The duration of each lesson was timed by the clock, which eventually struck twelve. The superintendent rose. 'I have something to say to the students,' she announced.The noise of lessons ending was already beginning, but it subsided at the sound of her voice. She continued, 'This morning you had a breakfast you couldn't eat; you must be hungry. I have ordered that a lunch of bread and cheese be served to everyone.'The teachers looked at her with a kind of astonishment.'It is my responsibility,' she added to them in an explanatory tone, and immediately afterwards, she left the room.The bread and cheese was soon brought in and distributed, much to the delight and refreshment of the entire school.",
          "paraphrase_gpt-4.1-2025-04-14": "Fifteen minutes went by before lessons resumed, and during this time the schoolroom was filled with noisy excitement; conversation was allowed to be louder and more free, which everyone took advantage of, mainly talking about the unappetizing breakfast, which they all heavily criticized. This was their only means of comfort. Miss Miller was the sole teacher present, surrounded by some older girls who spoke with grave and sullen expressions. I overheard someone mention Mr. Brocklehurst, which made Miss Miller shake her head disapprovingly, though she didn't try hard to stop the group's complaints—likely because she felt the same way. \n\nAt nine o'clock, the classroom clock chimed; Miss Miller moved to the center and called for silence and order. The students quickly organized themselves and returned to near silence, quelling the earlier chaos. Other teachers soon resumed their places, but everyone seemed to be waiting for something. The eighty girls sat straight and still on benches lining the room, looking rather peculiar in their simple brown dresses, high necklines, white collars, little front-tied pockets, woolen stockings, and locally made shoes with brass buckles. Over twenty of them were actually young women, and the severe uniform seemed odd and unflattering on them all, even the prettiest.\n\nAs I studied both girls and teachers—finding the teachers rather unappealing, with one stout and rough, another dark and fierce, a foreigner harsh and odd-looking, and poor Miss Miller looking worn and weather-beaten—suddenly, everyone in the school rose at once without any apparent command. Confused, I saw they soon sat again, all eyes fixed on one spot: the woman who had greeted me the previous evening. Standing by the fire at the far end, she silently observed the students. Miss Miller approached her to ask something, and after getting an answer, returned and instructed, “Monitor of the first class, fetch the globes!”\n\nAs the globes were brought, the lady slowly walked up the room, and I was filled with a sense of respectful awe. In daylight, she appeared tall, graceful, with fair skin, brown eyes shining kindly, and finely shaped features. Her dark brown hair was styled in neat curls around her temples, fashionably dressed in purple with black velvet trim, and she wore a gold watch at her waist. To complete the picture: her elegant presence and clear, if pale, complexion captured a sense of refinement. This was Miss Temple—Maria Temple, as I later learned from a prayer book she entrusted to me for church.\n\nMiss Temple, the superintendent, seated herself by the globes and gathered the first class around her for a geography lesson, while the other teachers led the younger classes in history, grammar, and similar subjects for an hour. Writing and arithmetic followed, and Miss Temple also gave music lessons to some of the older girls. The clock marked the end of lessons at noon. Miss Temple stood and addressed everyone, her mere voice calming the growing excitement:\n\n“Your breakfast this morning was inedible; you must be hungry. I have ordered bread and cheese to be served to everyone.”\n\nHer statement surprised the teachers, but she explained she took responsibility, then left. Soon, the food was served, greatly delighting and refreshing the whole school."

          "text_segment": "The order was now given “To the garden!” Each put on a coarse straw bonnet, with strings of coloured calico, and a cloak of grey frieze. I was similarly equipped, and, following the stream, I made my way into the open air.\nThe garden was a wide inclosure, surrounded with walls so high as to exclude every glimpse of prospect; a covered verandah ran down one side, and broad walks bordered a middle space divided into scores of little beds: these beds were assigned as gardens for the pupils to cultivate, and each bed had an owner. When full of flowers they would doubtless look pretty; but now, at the latter end of January, all was wintry blight and brown decay. I shuddered as I stood and looked round me: it was an inclement day for outdoor exercise; not positively rainy, but darkened by a drizzling yellow fog; all under foot was still soaking wet with the floods of yesterday. The stronger among the girls ran about and engaged in active games, but sundry pale and thin ones herded together for shelter and warmth in the verandah; and amongst these, as the dense mist penetrated to their shivering frames, I heard frequently the sound of a hollow cough.\nAs yet I had spoken to no one, nor did anybody seem to take notice of me; I stood lonely enough: but to that feeling of isolation I was accustomed; it did not oppress me much. I leant against a pillar of the verandah, drew my grey mantle close about me, and, trying to forget the cold which nipped me without, and the unsatisfied hunger which gnawed me within, delivered myself up to the employment of watching and thinking. My reflections were too undefined and fragmentary to merit record: I hardly yet knew where I was; Gateshead and my past life seemed floated away to an immeasurable distance; the present was vague and strange, and of the future I could form no conjecture. I looked round the convent-like garden, and then up at the house—a large building, half of which seemed grey and old, the other half quite new. The new part, containing the schoolroom and dormitory, was lit by mullioned and latticed windows, which gave it a church-like aspect; a stone tablet over the door bore this inscription:—\nLOWOOD INSTITUTION.\n\nThis portion was rebuilt A.D. ——, by Naomi Brocklehurst,\nof Brocklehurst Hall, in this county.\n“Let your light so shine before men, that they may see your good works, and glorify your Father which is in heaven.”—St. Matt. v. 16.\nI read these words over and over again: I felt that an explanation belonged to them, and was unable fully to penetrate their import. I was still pondering the signification of “Institution,” and endeavouring to make out a connection between the first words and the verse of Scripture, when the sound of a cough close behind me made me turn my head. I saw a girl sitting on a stone bench near; she was bent over a book, on the perusal of which she seemed intent: from where I stood I could see the title—it was “Rasselas;” a name that struck me as strange, and consequently attractive. In turning a leaf she happened to look up, and I said to her directly—\n“Is your book interesting?” I had already formed the intention of asking her to lend it to me some day.\n“I like it,” she answered, after a pause of a second or two, during which she examined me.\n“What is it about?” I continued. I hardly know where I found the hardihood thus to open a conversation with a stranger; the step was contrary to my nature and habits: but I think her occupation touched a chord of sympathy somewhere; for I too liked reading, though of a frivolous and childish kind; I could not digest or comprehend the serious or substantial.\n“You may look at it,” replied the girl, offering me the book.\nI did so; a brief examination convinced me that the contents were less taking than the title: “Rasselas” looked dull to my trifling taste; I saw nothing about fairies, nothing about genii; no bright variety seemed spread over the closely-printed pages. I returned it to her; she received it quietly, and without saying anything she was about to relapse into her former studious mood: again I ventured to disturb her—\n“Can you tell me what the writing on that stone over the door means? What is Lowood Institution?”\n“This house where you are come to live.”\n“And why do they call it Institution? Is it in any way different from other schools?”\n“It is partly a charity-school: you and I, and all the rest of us, are charity-children. I suppose you are an orphan: are not either your father or your mother dead?”\n“Both died before I can remember.”\n“Well, all the girls here have lost either one or both parents, and this is called an institution for educating orphans.”\n“Do we pay no money? Do they keep us for nothing?”\n“We pay, or our friends pay, fifteen pounds a year for each.”\n“Then why do they call us charity-children?”\n“Because fifteen pounds is not enough for board and teaching, and the deficiency is supplied by subscription.”\n“Who subscribes?”\n“Different benevolent-minded ladies and gentlemen in this neighbourhood and in London.”\n“Who was Naomi Brocklehurst?”\n“The lady who built the new part of this house as that tablet records, and whose son overlooks and directs everything here.”\n“Why?”\n“Because he is treasurer and manager of the establishment.”\n“Then this house does not belong to that tall lady who wears a watch, and who said we were to have some bread and cheese?”\n“To Miss Temple? Oh, no! I wish it did: she has to answer to Mr. Brocklehurst for all she does. Mr. Brocklehurst buys all our food and all our clothes.”\n“Does he live here?”\n“No—two miles off, at a large hall.”\n“Is he a good man?”\n“He is a clergyman, and is said to do a great deal of good.”\n“Did you say that tall lady was called Miss Temple?”\n“Yes.”\n“And what are the other teachers called?”\n“The one with red cheeks is called Miss Smith; she attends to the work, and cuts out—for we make our own clothes, our frocks, and pelisses, and everything; the little one with black hair is Miss Scatcherd; she teaches history and grammar, and hears the second class repetitions; and the one who wears a shawl, and has a pocket-handkerchief tied to her side with a yellow ribband, is Madame Pierrot: she comes from Lisle, in France, and teaches French.”\n“Do you like the teachers?”\n“Well enough.”\n“Do you like the little black one, and the Madame ——?—I cannot pronounce her name as you do.”\n“Miss Scatcherd is hasty—you must take care not to offend her; Madame Pierrot is not a bad sort of person.”\n“But Miss Temple is the best—isn’t she?”\n“Miss Temple is very good and very clever; she is above the rest, because she knows far more than they do.”\n“Have you been long here?”\n“Two years.”\n“Are you an orphan?”\n“My mother is dead.”\n“Are you happy here?”\n“You ask rather too many questions. I have given you answers enough for the present: now I want to read.”\nBut at that moment the summons sounded for dinner; all re-entered the house.",
          "paraphrase_gemini-2.5-flash-preview-04-17": "The command was then given to go to the garden. Everyone put on a rough straw bonnet with brightly coloured fabric ties and a grey woollen cloak. I dressed the same way and joined the crowd heading outside into the open air. The garden was a large enclosed area surrounded by walls so high they blocked any view beyond. A covered walkway extended along one side, and wide paths ran alongside a central area divided into many small plots. These plots were allocated for the students to tend as their own gardens. When filled with flowers, they would no doubt be attractive, but now, in late January, everything looked dead and brown from the winter. I felt a shiver standing and looking around; it was an unpleasant day for being outdoors. It wasn't actively raining, but a misty yellow fog obscured the light, and the ground was still waterlogged from the previous day's rain. The healthier girls ran around and played energetic games, while some frail and thin ones gathered in the covered verandah for protection and warmth. Among these, as the thick fog chilled their bodies, I often heard the sound of a deep cough. Until this point, I hadn't spoken to anyone, and no one seemed to notice me. I felt quite alone, but I was used to this feeling of isolation, and it didn't bother me much. I leaned against a verandah pillar, wrapped my grey cloak tightly around me, and tried to ignore the external cold that bit at me and the internal pangs of hunger. I occupied myself with observing and contemplating. My thoughts were too vague and disconnected to be worth describing; I barely grasped where I was. Gateshead and my former life seemed incredibly distant, the present felt undefined and strange, and I couldn't even guess at the future. I looked around the garden, which felt like a convent's, and then up at the house. It was a large structure, half of which appeared grey and ancient, while the other half looked brand new. The new section, containing the schoolroom and dormitory, had windows with multiple sections and lattice work, giving it a church-like appearance. A stone plaque above the door bore the inscription: LOWOOD INSTITUTION. This section was rebuilt in the year ----, by Naomi Brocklehurst, of Brocklehurst Hall, in this county. 'Let your light so shine before men, that they may see your good works, and glorify your Father which is in heaven.' --St. Matt. v. 16. I read these words repeatedly, feeling they held significance I couldn't fully grasp. I was still pondering the meaning of 'Institution' and trying to connect the initial words with the Bible verse when I heard a cough nearby and turned my head. I saw a girl sitting on a stone bench nearby, hunched over a book she seemed engrossed in. From where I stood, I could see the title was 'Rasselas,' a name I found odd and therefore intriguing. As she turned a page, she happened to look up, and I immediately asked her, 'Is your book interesting?' I had already planned to ask her to lend it to me later. 'I like it,' she responded after a brief pause during which she studied me. 'What is it about?' I continued. I hardly knew how I found the courage to start a conversation with a stranger; it went against my usual cautious nature. But I think her reading struck a sympathetic chord within me, because I also enjoyed reading, though my taste was for frivolous and childish stories; I couldn't grasp or appreciate serious or complex material. 'You can look at it,' the girl replied, offering me the book. I took it, and a quick look confirmed that the content was less appealing than the title. 'Rasselas' struck my simple taste as boring; I saw no mention of fairies or genies, and the densely printed pages lacked any sense of exciting variety. I gave it back to her; she accepted it quietly and was about to return to her reading without comment. I decided to interrupt her again: 'Can you explain the writing on that stone above the door? What is Lowood Institution?' 'This is the house where you've come to live.' 'And why is it called an Institution? Is it different from other schools in some way?' 'It's partly a charity school; you, me, and all the others here are charity children. I assume you're an orphan: are either of your parents deceased?' 'Both died before I can remember.' 'Well, all the girls here have lost at least one parent, and this place is known as an institution for educating orphans.' 'So we don't pay anything? They support us for free?' 'We pay, or our guardians pay, fifteen pounds a year for each student.' 'Then why are we called charity children?' 'Because fifteen pounds isn't enough to cover board and teaching, and the shortfall is covered by donations.' 'Who donates?' 'Various kind-hearted ladies and gentlemen in this area and in London.' 'Who was Naomi Brocklehurst?' 'She was the lady who funded the construction of the new part of this building, as the tablet indicates, and whose son oversees and manages everything here.' 'Why?' 'Because he is the treasurer and manager of the establishment.' 'So this house doesn't belong to that tall lady who wears a watch, the one who said we would get bread and cheese?' 'You mean Miss Temple? Oh, no! I wish it did; she has to answer to Mr. Brocklehurst for everything she does. Mr. Brocklehurst is in charge of buying all our food and clothing.' 'Does he live here?' 'No, he lives two miles away, at a large estate.' 'Is he a good man?' 'He is a clergyman, and people say he does a great deal of good.' 'Did you say that tall lady was called Miss Temple?' 'Yes.' 'And what are the other teachers called?' 'The one with rosy cheeks is Miss Smith; she supervises the sewing and cutting, because we make our own clothes, our dresses, coats, and everything. The short one with dark hair is Miss Scatcherd; she teaches history and grammar and hears the second class recite lessons. And the one wearing a shawl with a handkerchief tied to her side with a yellow ribbon is Madame Pierrot; she is from Lisle, in France, and teaches French.' 'Do you like the teachers?' 'Well enough.' 'Do you like the short dark one, and Madame -- I can't pronounce her name like you do.' 'Miss Scatcherd is easily angered; you have to be careful not to provoke her. Madame Pierrot is a reasonably decent person.' 'But Miss Temple is the best, isn't she?' 'Miss Temple is very good and very smart; she stands out from the others because she knows much more than they do.' 'Have you been here long?' 'Two years.' 'Are you an orphan?' 'My mother is deceased.' 'Are you happy here?' 'You're asking quite a lot of questions. I've answered enough for now; I want to read.' But just then, the bell rang for dinner, and everyone went back inside the house.",
          "paraphrase_gpt-4.1-2025-04-14": "We were told to go to the garden, so everyone put on plain straw bonnets with colorful ties and grey cloaks. I dressed the same and followed the group outside. The garden was a large, walled enclosure with high walls that prevented us from seeing anything outside. There was a covered walkway on one side, wide paths, and the central area was divided into many small garden plots, each cared for by a pupil. In winter, the beds looked barren and lifeless. It was a cold, gloomy day with damp ground from yesterday's rain. Some of the stronger girls played, but others who looked sickly gathered in the verandah for warmth, and I heard them coughing. I hadn't spoken to anyone and no one spoke to me, but loneliness was familiar to me and didn't trouble me. I leaned against a pillar, wrapped myself tighter in my cloak, and tried to ignore my cold and hunger by watching the others and thinking. My thoughts were vague; the past felt far away, and the present was uncertain. I looked at the building, part old and part new, with church-like windows in the new section and a stone sign reading 'Lowood Institution,' mentioning Naomi Brocklehurst and a Bible verse. I pondered its meaning when someone coughed nearby. It was a girl reading a book called 'Rasselas.' Curious, I asked if she liked her book and what it was about. She let me look at it, but I found it boring. Next, I asked her about the sign—what was Lowood Institution, was it a charity? She explained that it was a partly charitable school for orphans like us, supported by fees and donations from kind people, with Mr. Brocklehurst managing it. Miss Temple, the lady I’d seen, was in charge under Mr. Brocklehurst, and there were other teachers too: Miss Smith, Miss Scatcherd, and Madame Pierrot. She described each one. I asked if she’d been there long and if she was happy. She replied she’d been there two years, and then wanted to return to her reading, but just then, we were called in for dinner."

I ate what I could, and wondered within myself whether every day’s fare would be like this.\nAfter dinner, we immediately adjourned to the schoolroom: lessons recommenced, and were continued till five o’clock.\nThe only marked event of the afternoon was, that I saw the girl with whom I had conversed in the verandah dismissed in disgrace by Miss Scatcherd from a history class, and sent to stand in the middle of the large schoolroom. The punishment seemed to me in a high degree ignominious, especially for so great a girl—she looked thirteen or upwards. I expected she would show signs of great distress and shame; but to my surprise she neither wept nor blushed: composed, though grave, she stood, the central mark of all eyes. “How can she bear it so quietly—so firmly?” I asked of myself. “Were I in her place, it seems to me I should wish the earth to open and swallow me up. She looks as if she were thinking of something beyond her punishment—beyond her situation: of something not round her nor before her. I have heard of day-dreams—is she in a day-dream now? Her eyes are fixed on the floor, but I am sure they do not see it—her sight seems turned in, gone down into her heart: she is looking at what she can remember, I believe; not at what is really present. I wonder what sort of a girl she is—whether good or naughty.”\nSoon after five P.M. we had another meal, consisting of a small mug of coffee, and half-a-slice of brown bread. I devoured my bread and drank my coffee with relish; but I should have been glad of as much more—I was still hungry. Half-an-hour’s recreation succeeded, then study; then the glass of water and the piece of oat-cake, prayers, and bed. Such was my first day at Lowood.",
          "paraphrase_gemini-2.5-flash-preview-04-17": "The smell in the dining hall for dinner was hardly more appealing than the one from breakfast; the meal itself was served in two large metal containers, releasing a strong steam smelling of spoiled fat. The food turned out to be a mix of unremarkable potatoes and strange, brown-tinged pieces of meat, all cooked together. Each student received a fairly large helping of this mixture. I ate what I could and wondered if this would be the typical meal every day. Immediately after dinner, we went back to the schoolroom; lessons resumed and continued until five o'clock. The only notable event that afternoon was witnessing Miss Scatcherd dismiss the girl I had spoken with on the porch from her history class in disgrace, making her stand in the center of the large schoolroom as punishment. The penalty struck me as extremely humiliating, especially for a girl her age – she appeared to be thirteen or older. I expected her to show clear signs of distress and shame, but to my surprise, she neither cried nor blushed. Calm, though serious, she stood there, the focal point of everyone's attention. 'How can she endure it so calmly, so steadfastly?' I asked myself. 'If I were in her situation, I feel I would wish the ground would open up and swallow me. She seems to be thinking about something beyond her punishment, beyond her current circumstances – something not immediately around her or in front of her. I've heard of daydreaming – is she doing that now? Her eyes are focused on the floor, but I'm certain they aren't seeing it; her gaze seems turned inward, descended into her heart. I believe she's looking at memories, not at what is actually present. I wondered what kind of girl she was – whether she was good or bad.' Shortly after 5 P.M., we had another meal, which consisted of a small cup of coffee and half a slice of brown bread. I eagerly ate my bread and drank my coffee, finding it pleasant; however, I would have liked more – I was still hungry. This was followed by half an hour of free time, then study, then a glass of water and a piece of oatcake, prayers, and finally, bed. That summarizes my first day at Lowood.",

The food turned out to be mediocre potatoes mixed with odd pieces of tough, old meat, all cooked together. Each student was given a generous portion of this dish. I ate as much as I could manage and wondered if this would be the daily meal. After dinner, we went straight back to the classroom, where lessons resumed and lasted until five o’clock. The only noteworthy event that afternoon was witnessing the girl I had spoken with earlier in the verandah being reprimanded by Miss Scatcherd during history class and made to stand in the middle of the room as punishment. This seemed an especially humiliating penalty for someone her age—she appeared to be at least thirteen. I expected her to show signs of embarrassment or sorrow, but to my surprise, she remained calm and serious, showing neither tears nor blushes as all eyes watched her. I asked myself how she could endure such a public punishment so composedly, when I thought I would want to disappear if it were me. She looked as if her thoughts were elsewhere, disconnected from her situation. I wondered if she was lost in a daydream, for her gaze was downward, but I suspected she was absorbed in her memories rather than looking at the floor. I found myself curious about her character—was she well-behaved or troublesome? Not long after five o’clock, we had another meal that consisted of a small cup of coffee and half a slice of brown bread.

I kept expecting that Miss Scatcherd would praise her attention; but, instead of that, she suddenly cried out—\n“You dirty, disagreeable girl! you have never cleaned your nails this morning!”\nBurns made no answer: I wondered at her silence.\n“Why,” thought I, “does she not explain that she could neither clean her nails nor wash her face, as the water was frozen?”\nMy attention was now called off by Miss Smith desiring me to hold a skein of thread: while she was winding it, she talked to me from time to time, asking whether I had ever been at school before, whether I could mark, stitch, knit, &c.; till she dismissed me, I could not pursue my observations on Miss Scatcherd’s movements. When I returned to my seat, that lady was just delivering an order of which I did not catch the import; but Burns immediately left the class, and going into the small inner room where the books were kept, returned in half a minute, carrying in her hand a bundle of twigs tied together at one end. This ominous tool she presented to Miss Scatcherd with a respectful curtesy; then she quietly, and without being told, unloosed her pinafore, and the teacher instantly and sharply inflicted on her neck a dozen strokes with the bunch of twigs. Not a tear rose to Burns’ eye; and, while I paused from my sewing, because my fingers quivered at this spectacle with a sentiment of unavailing and impotent anger, not a feature of her pensive face altered its ordinary expression.\n“Hardened girl!” exclaimed Miss Scatcherd; “nothing can correct you of your slatternly habits: carry the rod away.”\nBurns obeyed: I looked at her narrowly as she emerged from the book-closet; she was just putting back her handkerchief into her pocket, and the trace of a tear glistened on her thin cheek.",

However, any difficult question posed was immediately resolved when directed at Burns; her memory appeared to have retained the entire lesson's content, and she was prepared to answer on every detail. I fully anticipated Miss Scatcherd would commend her attentiveness, but instead, she abruptly exclaimed, \"You filthy, unpleasant girl! You failed to clean your nails this morning!\" Burns remained silent, and I was surprised by her lack of response. I thought to myself, \"Why doesn't she explain that she couldn't clean her nails or wash her face because the water was frozen?\" My focus was then redirected when Miss Smith asked me to hold a length of thread. While winding it, she occasionally spoke to me, inquiring if I had attended school previously, whether I could mark fabric, stitch, knit, etc. Until she dismissed me, I couldn't continue observing Miss Scatcherd's actions. Upon returning to my seat, I heard that lady giving an instruction whose specifics I missed, but Burns promptly left the class and went into the small inner room where the books were kept. Within half a minute, she returned carrying a bundle of twigs tied at one end. This ominous object she presented to Miss Scatcherd with a respectful curtsy. Then, quietly and without being told, she untied her pinafore. The teacher instantly and forcefully struck her neck a dozen times with the bunch of twigs. No tears formed in Burns' eyes, and while I paused from my sewing, my fingers trembling with a feeling of useless and powerless anger at the sight, her thoughtful face showed no change from its usual expression. \"Stubborn girl!\" cried Miss Scatcherd. \"Nothing will cure you of your untidy habits! Put the rod away.\" Burns complied.

I wondered why she didn’t explain that she couldn’t wash because the water was frozen. Then, Miss Smith asked me to help with some thread and asked about my previous schooling and needlework abilities, so I couldn’t keep watching what happened with Miss Scatcherd. When I got back, Miss Scatcherd was giving an order, the meaning of which I missed, but Burns left and came back with a bundle of twigs. She presented it to Miss Scatcherd politely, then undid her pinafore, and Miss Scatcherd struck her neck a dozen times with the twigs. Burns did not cry; as I paused my sewing, shaken with powerless anger at the scene, her sad face stayed unchanged. Miss Scatcherd called her a hardened girl and told her to take the rod away.

Your thoughts never seemed to drift while Miss Miller explained the lesson and questioned you. My thoughts, however, constantly stray. When I should be listening attentively to Miss Scatcherd and absorbing everything she says with diligence, I often lose the sound of her voice entirely; I fall into a kind of daydream. Sometimes I imagine I'm in Northumberland, and the sounds around me are the gurgling of a small stream that runs through Deepden, near our house.

This afternoon, instead of dreaming of Deepden, I was wondering how a man who intended to do right could act as unjustly and unwisely as Charles the First sometimes did, and I thought it was a pity that, despite his honesty and principles, he couldn't see past the rights of the crown. If only he had been able to look ahead and see the direction what they call the spirit of the age was heading! Still, I like Charles—I respect him—I pity him, that poor murdered king!

I’m careless, I forget the rules, I read instead of doing my lessons, I have no system, and sometimes, like you, I find it hard to stand being forced into rigid routines. This annoys Miss Scatcherd a lot because she’s naturally neat, punctual, and precise.\"\n\"And irritable and harsh,\" I added, but Helen Burns did not agree and remained silent.\n\"Is Miss Temple as strict with you as Miss Scatcherd?\"\nAs soon as I mentioned Miss Temple, a gentle smile appeared on Helen’s serious face.\n\"Miss Temple is extremely kind; it hurts her to be strict with anyone, even the worst student. She points out my mistakes gently, and if I do something praiseworthy, she is generous with praise. But a clear sign of my flaws is that even her gentle reasoning doesn’t seem to help me correct my faults, nor does her praise motivate me to be more diligent.\"\n\"That's strange,\" I said. \"I find it easy to be careful.\"\n\"For you, I’m sure it is. I noticed how attentive you were in class this morning while Miss Miller taught and questioned you—your mind never wandered. But my mind constantly drifts. When I should be listening to Miss Scatcherd and paying attention, I often miss everything she says and drift into a daydream. Sometimes I imagine myself back in Northumberland, listening to the bubbling brook by Deepden near my home. Then, when I’m called on to answer, I have to snap out of it and realize I haven’t heard anything, so I can’t answer.\"\n\"Yet you answered so well this afternoon.\"\n\"That was pure luck; the topic interested me. Instead of daydreaming about Deepden, I was wondering how a man who wanted to do right could do such unfair things as Charles the First did. I thought it was a shame that, with his honesty and conscience, he couldn’t see beyond the rights of the crown. If only he had looked further and seen where the times were leading! Still, I like Charles—I respect him and feel sorry for him, poor murdered king! His enemies were worse; they shed blood they had no right to take. How could they dare to kill him?\""

Would you not be happier if you tried to forget her severity, together with the passionate emotions it excited? Life appears to me too short to be spent in nursing animosity or registering wrongs. We are, and must be, one and all, burdened with faults in this world: but the time will soon come when, I trust, we shall put them off in putting off our corruptible bodies; when debasement and sin will fall from us with this cumbrous frame of flesh, and only the spark of the spirit will remain,—the impalpable principle of light and thought, pure as when it left the Creator to inspire the creature: whence it came it will return; perhaps again to be communicated to some being higher than man—perhaps to pass through gradations of glory, from the pale human soul to brighten to the seraph! Surely it will never, on the contrary, be suffered to degenerate from man to fiend? No; I cannot believe that: I hold another creed: which no one ever taught me, and which I seldom mention; but in which I delight, and to which I cling: for it extends hope to all: it makes Eternity a rest—a mighty home, not a terror and an abyss. Besides, with this creed, I can so clearly distinguish between the criminal and his crime; I can so sincerely forgive the first while I abhor the last: with this creed revenge never worries my heart, degradation never too deeply disgusts me, injustice never crushes me too low: I live in calm, looking to the end.”",

But you recall everything she has done and said to you with such precision! Her unfairness seems to have left an unusually deep mark on your emotions! No mistreatment leaves such a permanent impression on my feelings. Wouldn't you be happier if you tried to forget her harshness, along with the intense emotions it provoked? Life seems too brief to waste on harboring resentment or dwelling on injustices. We all carry faults in this world, and must do so. But the time will soon arrive when, I believe, we will shed these faults as we shed our temporary bodies; when corruption and sin will fall away with this heavy physical form, and only the spiritual core will remain—the intangible source of light and thought, as pure as when it left the Creator to inhabit creation. From where it came, it will return; perhaps to be imparted again to a being superior to humans—perhaps to advance through stages of glory, brightening from the modest human soul to become like a seraph! Surely, it won't be allowed to degrade from human to demon? No, I cannot believe that; I follow a different belief system, one no one taught me, and which I rarely discuss. But I cherish it and hold onto it dearly, for it offers hope to everyone. It makes Eternity a place of rest—a vast home, not something terrifying or an abyss. Moreover, with this belief, I can clearly distinguish between the wrongdoer and the wrong deed; I can sincerely forgive the former while detesting the latter.

Impatient, I pressed her, asking if Mrs. Reed wasn't truly cruel. Helen replied that Mrs. Reed had been unkind because she didn't like my personality, much like Miss Scatcherd disliked hers. Helen remarked on how strongly I remembered every mean thing Mrs. Reed had done or said, and how deeply her unfairness affected me—whereas Helen herself was not so marked by mistreatment. She suggested I would be happier if I tried to let go of the anger and painful feelings. To Helen, life is too brief to waste on holding grudges or remembering every wrong. She believed that everyone has faults, but she had faith that after death, we would lose these imperfections and only the pure part of our spirit would remain, returning to its divine origin. She imagined that perhaps our spirit might even rise to higher forms rather than falling to worse, and she took comfort and hope in this idea—which she called her creed. This belief let her separate people from their bad actions, so she could forgive people even if she detested their behavior. With this perspective, revenge, shame, or injustice couldn't overwhelm her, and she looked to the future with calmness."

Our clothing was insufficient to protect us from the severe cold: we had no boots, the snow got into our shoes and melted there: our ungloved hands became numbed and covered with chilblains, as were our feet: I remember well the distracting irritation I endured from this cause every evening, when my feet inflamed; and the torture of thrusting the swelled, raw, and stiff toes into my shoes in the morning. Then the scanty supply of food was distressing: with the keen appetites of growing children, we had scarcely sufficient to keep alive a delicate invalid.

Despite this, we were still required to spend an hour outdoors each day. Our clothing was insufficient protection against the intense cold; lacking boots, snow would enter our shoes and thaw there.

Moreover, the meager quantity of food was upsetting; with the strong appetites of growing children, we received hardly enough sustenance to nourish even a delicate invalid.

          "paraphrase_gpt-4.1-2025-04-14": "My first three months at Lowood felt much longer than they actually were, and they were certainly not pleasant. I struggled to adapt to unfamiliar routines and challenging tasks, and my anxiety about failing to meet expectations was even worse than the physical discomforts, which were themselves significant. During the winter months of January, February, and part of March, heavy snowfall and, later, the muddy, impassable roads meant we could only leave the school grounds to go to church; otherwise, we had to spend an hour each day outdoors, despite the cold. Our clothes didn’t shield us from the harsh winter; without boots, snow would enter our shoes and soak our feet, and we had no gloves, so our hands and feet became numb and covered in painful sores. I vividly remember the intense irritation I felt each night when my feet became inflamed, and the pain of trying to jam my swollen, raw toes into my shoes every morning. The small amount of food provided to us was barely enough, especially for growing children. Because of this lack, the older, hungrier girls would often persuade or threaten the younger ones out of their share. Many times, I had to divide my meager piece of brown bread between two others at tea, and after giving away half my coffee to a third, I would finish what was left while secretly crying from hunger."

Yes, I was right: it was Mr. Brocklehurst, buttoned up in a surtout, and looking longer, narrower, and more rigid than ever.\nI had my own reasons for being dismayed at this apparition; too well I remembered the perfidious hints given by Mrs. Reed about my disposition, &c.; the promise pledged by Mr. Brocklehurst to apprise Miss Temple and the teachers of my vicious nature. All along I had been dreading the fulfilment of this promise,—I had been looking out daily for the “Coming Man,” whose information respecting my past life and conversation was to brand me as a bad child for ever: now there he was.\nHe stood at Miss Temple’s side; he was speaking low in her ear: I did not doubt he was making disclosures of my villainy; and I watched her eye with painful anxiety, expecting every moment to see its dark orb turn on me a glance of repugnance and contempt. I listened too; and as I happened to be seated quite at the top of the room, I caught most of what he said: its import relieved me from immediate apprehension.\n“I suppose, Miss Temple, the thread I bought at Lowton will do; it struck me that it would be just of the quality for the calico chemises, and I sorted the needles to match. You may tell Miss Smith that I forgot to make a memorandum of the darning needles, but she shall have some papers sent in next week; and she is not, on any account, to give out more than one at a time to each pupil: if they have more, they are apt to be careless and lose them.

I immediately recognized that thin figure. Just two minutes later, when everyone in the school, including the teachers, stood up together, I knew exactly who had entered without needing to lift my head. The familiar tall, dark form that had looked at me so sternly from the fireplace rug at Gateshead strode across the classroom and came to a stop next to Miss Temple, who had also risen. I cautiously glanced at this imposing figure. Yes, I was correct: it was Mr. Brocklehurst, buttoned up in an overcoat, appearing even taller, skinnier, and more rigid than I remembered.\n\nI had good reason to be unsettled by this appearance. I remembered all too well Mrs. Reed's malicious suggestions about my personality and other matters, and Mr. Brocklehurst's promise to inform Miss Temple and the staff about my supposed poor character. I had been dreading the fulfillment of this promise constantly, expecting the arrival of the \"Coming Man\" daily, whose account of my past would permanently brand me as a bad child. Now, he was here.\n\nHe stood beside Miss Temple, speaking softly into her ear. I had no doubt he was sharing details of my supposed wickedness. I watched her eyes with painful anxiety, anticipating that any moment her dark gaze would turn towards me with a look of disgust and scorn. I listened as well, and since I was seated near the front of the room, I managed to catch most of what he said. The content of his words immediately eased my fears.\n\n\"I believe, Miss Temple,\" he began, \"the thread I purchased in Lowton will be suitable. I felt it was just the right quality for the cotton undergarments, and I matched the needles accordingly. Please tell Miss Smith that I forgot to note down the darning needles, but I will send some packs next week. She is absolutely not to give out more than one needle per student at a time; if they have more, they tend to be careless and lose them. And, Madam, I really wish the woollen socks were better attended to! When I visited last, I went to the kitchen garden and inspected the clothes drying on the line. There was a significant number of black socks in very poor condition; the size of the holes made it clear they hadn't been properly mended regularly.\"",

I had been anxious ever since, expecting this moment when my reputation would be ruined by his report, and now here he was.\n\nHe began speaking quietly to Miss Temple, and I was certain he was telling her about my alleged misbehavior. I watched her nervously, waiting to see if she would look at me with disgust. From where I sat, I could hear much of what he said, and fortunately, it turned out to be harmless for now. He was only discussing practical matters: he thought some thread he had bought would be good for sewing the girls’ underclothes, and mentioned he’d send more darning needles next week, insisting that only one needle be issued per pupil to avoid loss. He also expressed concern about the poor condition of the woolen stockings, complaining that the girls were careless and the repairs weren’t being done regularly."

You are aware that my plan in bringing up these girls is, not to accustom them to habits of luxury and indulgence, but to render them hardy, patient, self-denying. Should any little accidental disappointment of the appetite occur, such as the spoiling of a meal, the under or the over dressing of a dish, the incident ought not to be neutralised by replacing with something more delicate the comfort lost, thus pampering the body and obviating the aim of this institution; it ought to be improved to the spiritual edification of the pupils, by encouraging them to evince fortitude under the temporary privation. A brief address on those occasions would not be mistimed, wherein a judicious instructor would take the opportunity of referring to the sufferings of the primitive Christians; to the torments of martyrs; to the exhortations of our blessed Lord Himself, calling upon His disciples to take up their cross and follow Him; to His warnings that man shall not live by bread alone, but by every word that proceedeth out of the mouth of God; to His divine consolations, ‘If ye suffer hunger or thirst for My sake, happy are ye.’ Oh, madam, when you put bread and cheese, instead of burnt porridge, into these children’s mouths, you may indeed feed their vile bodies, but you little think how you starve their immortal souls!”\nMr. Brocklehurst again paused—perhaps overcome by his feelings.

Furthermore, something else caught me by surprise,\" he added. \"While reviewing the housekeeper's accounts, I discovered that a meal of bread and cheese was provided to the girls on two occasions over the last two weeks.

Who initiated this change, and by whose permission?\" \"I must take responsibility for that situation, sir,\" Miss Temple replied. \"The morning meal was so poorly prepared that the students were unable to eat it, and I couldn't bring myself to let them go without food until the evening meal.\" \"Madam, permit me a moment,\" he began. \"You understand that my goal in educating these girls is not to get them used to comforts and excess, but rather to make them resilient, enduring, and able to deny themselves. If they experience any minor, unplanned food issue, like a ruined meal or a dish that's undercooked or overcooked, this problem shouldn't be fixed by giving them something nicer to make up for the discomfort, which would spoil their bodies and undermine the school's purpose. Instead, it should be used as an opportunity for the students' spiritual growth by urging them to show strength during the temporary lack. A short speech on such occasions would be fitting, where a wise teacher could reference the hardships faced by early Christians, the agony endured by martyrs, the calls from our Lord Himself for His followers to bear their burdens and accompany Him, His caution that people need more than just food to survive, but also guidance from God, and His comforting words, 'Blessed are you if you suffer hunger or thirst because of Me.' Oh, madam, when you provide bread and cheese to these children instead of inedible porridge, you might satisfy their earthly bodies, but you barely consider how you are depriving their eternal souls!\" Mr. Brocklehurst stopped speaking once more, possibly emotional.

A short talk in which the teacher refers to the suffering of early Christians, the martyrdom of saints, or the teachings of our Lord—who advised His followers to bear their burdens, reminded them that people do not live on bread alone, and promised blessings to those who starve for His sake—would be much more appropriate. By giving these girls bread and cheese instead of burned porridge, you feed their physical needs but neglect their spiritual well-being.\"\n\nMr. Brocklehurst paused again, perhaps moved by his own emotions. Miss Temple, who had looked down at first, now stared straight ahead. Her face, usually pale, had become cold and rigid like marble—her mouth pressed tightly closed and her brow settling into stern stillness."

          "text_segment": "Meantime, Mr. Brocklehurst, standing on the hearth with his hands behind his back, majestically surveyed the whole school. Suddenly his eye gave a blink, as if it had met something that either dazzled or shocked its pupil; turning, he said in more rapid accents than he had hitherto used—\n“Miss Temple, Miss Temple, what—what is that girl with curled hair? Red hair, ma’am, curled—curled all over?” And extending his cane he pointed to the awful object, his hand shaking as he did so.\n“It is Julia Severn,” replied Miss Temple, very quietly.\n“Julia Severn, ma’am! And why has she, or any other, curled hair? Why, in defiance of every precept and principle of this house, does she conform to the world so openly—here in an evangelical, charitable establishment—as to wear her hair one mass of curls?”\n“Julia’s hair curls naturally,” returned Miss Temple, still more quietly.\n“Naturally! Yes, but we are not to conform to nature; I wish these girls to be the children of Grace: and why that abundance? I have again and again intimated that I desire the hair to be arranged closely, modestly, plainly. Miss Temple, that girl’s hair must be cut off entirely; I will send a barber to-morrow: and I see others who have far too much of the excrescence—that tall girl, tell her to turn round. Tell all the first form to rise up and direct their faces to the wall.”\nMiss Temple passed her handkerchief over her lips, as if to smooth away the involuntary smile that curled them; she gave the order, however, and when the first class could take in what was required of them, they obeyed. Leaning a little back on my bench, I could see the looks and grimaces with which they commented on this manoeuvre: it was a pity Mr. Brocklehurst could not see them too; he would perhaps have felt that, whatever he might do with the outside of the cup and platter, the inside was further beyond his interference than he imagined.\nHe scrutinised the reverse of these living medals some five minutes, then pronounced sentence. These words fell like the knell of doom—\n“All those top-knots must be cut off.”",
          "paraphrase_gemini-2.5-flash-preview-04-17": "From the fireplace, Mr. Brocklehurst stood with his hands behind his back, grandly observing the entire school. Suddenly, his gaze seemed startled, as if seeing something either astonishing or offensive. He quickly turned and, speaking faster than before, asked, 'Miss Temple, Miss Temple, who is that girl with curly hair? Red hair, ma'am, curled - curled all over?' He pointed at the girl with his shaking cane, referring to her as an 'awful object'. Miss Temple calmly replied, 'It is Julia Severn.' 'Julia Severn, ma'am!' Brocklehurst exclaimed. 'And why does she, or anyone else, have curled hair? How can she so openly imitate the world here, in a charitable religious school, by having such a mass of curls, going against all the rules and beliefs of this place?' Miss Temple, even more quietly, responded, 'Julia's hair curls naturally.' 'Naturally!' he retorted. 'Yes, but we must not follow nature; I want these girls to be spiritually pure. And why such a large amount? I have repeatedly stated that I want hair styled neatly, modestly, simply. Miss Temple, that girl's hair must be completely cut off; I will send a barber tomorrow. And I see others with far too much of this unnecessary growth - that tall girl, tell her to turn around. Tell the entire first form to stand up and face the wall.' Miss Temple discreetly wiped her lips with her handkerchief, as if to hide a slight, unwilling smile. However, she gave the command, and when the first class understood what was required, they complied. Leaning back slightly on my bench, I observed their expressions and gestures as they reacted to this order. It was unfortunate Mr. Brocklehurst couldn't see them too; he might have realised that, no matter what he did to their outward appearance, their inner thoughts were much harder for him to influence than he imagined. He closely examined the turned backs of these living 'medals' for about five minutes before declaring his judgment. These words sounded ominous, like a death knell: 'All those elaborate hairstyles must be cut off.'",
          "paraphrase_gpt-4.1-2025-04-14": "While Mr. Brocklehurst stood by the fireplace with his hands clasped behind him, he surveyed the room authoritatively. Suddenly, he was startled by something his gaze landed on, and he spoke more quickly than before: “Miss Temple, who is that girl with curled hair? Red and full of curls?” he asked, pointing his cane while his hand trembled. Miss Temple calmly answered, “She is Julia Severn.” \n\nMr. Brocklehurst exclaimed, “Julia Severn! Why does she, or anyone, have curled hair? Why does she flaunt such a worldly style in this godly, charitable school by wearing her hair in curls?” Miss Temple explained, “Julia’s hair curls naturally.” \n\nHe retorted, “Naturally! But we’re not to follow nature; I want the girls here to be models of Grace. I have often said the hair should be simple and modest. That girl’s hair must be cut off; I’ll arrange for a barber tomorrow. Others also have excessive hair—like that tall girl. Make her turn around. All of the first group, stand up and face the wall.” Suppressing a smile, Miss Temple gave the instruction, and once the first class understood, they complied. Leaning back, I noticed their expressions and silent reactions; it was unfortunate Mr. Brocklehurst missed this, as he might have realized that outward discipline couldn’t reach their inner thoughts. After a period of inspecting the girls from behind, he gave his verdict: “All those hair buns must be cut off.”"

To this end, I had sat well back on the form, and while seeming to be busy with my sum, had held my slate in such a manner as to conceal my face: I might have escaped notice, had not my treacherous slate somehow happened to slip from my hand, and falling with an obtrusive crash, directly drawn every eye upon me; I knew it was all over now, and, as I stooped to pick up the two fragments of slate, I rallied my forces for the worst. It came.\n“A careless girl!” said Mr. Brocklehurst, and immediately after—“It is the new pupil, I perceive.” And before I could draw breath, “I must not forget I have a word to say respecting her.” Then aloud: how loud it seemed to me! “Let the child who broke her slate come forward!”\nOf my own accord I could not have stirred; I was paralysed: but the two great girls who sat on each side of me, set me on my legs and pushed me towards the dread judge, and then Miss Temple gently assisted me to his very feet, and I caught her whispered counsel—\n“Don’t be afraid, Jane, I saw it was an accident; you shall not be punished.”\nThe kind whisper went to my heart like a dagger.\n“Another minute, and she will despise me for a hypocrite,” thought I; and an impulse of fury against Reed, Brocklehurst, and Co. bounded in my pulses at the conviction. I was no Helen Burns.\n“Fetch that stool,” said Mr. Brocklehurst, pointing to a very high one from which a monitor had just risen: it was brought.\n“Place the child upon it.”\nAnd I was placed there, by whom I don’t know: I was in no condition to note particulars; I was only aware that they had hoisted me up to the height of Mr. Brocklehurst’s nose, that he was within a yard of me, and that a spread of shot orange and purple silk pelisses and a cloud of silvery plumage extended and waved below me.\nMr. Brocklehurst hemmed.\n“Ladies,” said he, turning to his family, “Miss Temple, teachers, and children, you all see this girl?”\nOf course they did; for I felt their eyes directed like burning-glasses against my scorched skin.\n“You see she is yet young; you observe she possesses the ordinary form of childhood; God has graciously given her the shape that He has given to all of us; no signal deformity points her out as a marked character. Who would think that the Evil One had already found a servant and agent in her? Yet such, I grieve to say, is the case.”\nA pause—in which I began to steady the palsy of my nerves, and to feel that the Rubicon was passed; and that the trial, no longer to be shirked, must be firmly sustained.\n“My dear children,” pursued the black marble clergyman, with pathos, “this is a sad, a melancholy occasion; for it becomes my duty to warn you, that this girl, who might be one of God’s own lambs, is a little castaway: not a member of the true flock, but evidently an interloper and an alien. You must be on your guard against her; you must shun her example; if necessary, avoid her company, exclude her from your sports, and shut her out from your converse. Teachers, you must watch her: keep your eyes on her movements, weigh well her words, scrutinise her actions, punish her body to save her soul: if, indeed, such salvation be possible, for (my tongue falters while I tell it) this girl, this child, the native of a Christian land, worse than many a little heathen who says its prayers to Brahma and kneels before Juggernaut—this girl is—a liar!”",
          "paraphrase_gemini-2.5-flash-preview-04-17": "Previously, while I was trying to absorb what Mr. Brocklehurst and Miss Temple were saying, I was also taking steps to ensure my own safety, which I believed depended on remaining unnoticed. To achieve this, I had positioned myself far back on the bench and, pretending to be occupied with my arithmetic problem, held my slate in front of my face. I might have successfully avoided detection, had my unreliable slate not somehow slipped from my grasp. It fell with a noticeable crash, instantly drawing everyone's attention to me. I knew then that my efforts to hide had failed. As I bent to collect the broken pieces, I braced myself for the worst. It arrived. “A careless girl!” Mr. Brocklehurst exclaimed, adding immediately, “Ah, I see it is the new pupil.” Before I could even catch my breath, he continued, “I must remember I have something to say concerning her.” Then, addressing the room loudly – it seemed deafening to me! – he commanded, “Let the child who broke her slate come forward!” I was too petrified to move on my own. I was paralyzed. However, the two taller girls sitting beside me lifted me to my feet and gently pushed me towards the fearsome judge. Miss Temple then softly guided me the rest of the way to where he stood, and I caught her quiet advice: “Don’t be afraid, Jane, I saw it was an accident; you will not be punished.” Her kind whisper felt like a sharp jab to my heart. I thought, “In just another moment, she will see me as a hypocrite and despise me.” A wave of anger towards Reed, Brocklehurst, and others surged through me with this realization. I was certainly not like Helen Burns. Mr. Brocklehurst pointed to a very tall stool that a monitor had just left and ordered, “Fetch that stool.” It was brought. “Place the child upon it.” I was lifted onto it by someone; I wasn't in a state to notice who. I was only aware that I had been hoisted up to approximately the level of Mr. Brocklehurst’s nose, that he was only about a yard away, and that a wide display of shot orange and purple silk cloaks and a mass of shimmering feathery hats belonging to his family spread out and fluttered below me. Mr. Brocklehurst cleared his throat. Turning to his family, Miss Temple, the teachers, and the students, he announced, “Ladies, Miss Temple, teachers, and children, you all see this girl?” Of course they did; I felt their eyes focused on me like magnifying glasses burning my skin. He continued, “You see she is still young; you observe she has the typical appearance of a child; God has kindly given her the form He gives to everyone; no obvious physical flaw marks her as peculiar. Who would imagine that the Devil has already made her his tool and agent? Yet, I regret to state, this is the case.” There was a pause, during which I began to calm my trembling nerves and accept that there was no turning back; the difficult situation had to be endured firmly. “My dear children,” the stern, dark-clad clergyman went on sadly, “this is a somber, a mournful occasion; for it is now my duty to warn you that this girl, who could potentially be one of God’s innocent lambs, is a lost soul. She is not a true member of the flock, but clearly an intruder and an outsider. You must be wary of her; you must avoid following her bad example; if needed, stay away from her, exclude her from your games, and cease conversing with her. Teachers, you must monitor her; keep a close watch on her actions, carefully consider her words, scrutinize everything she does, and discipline her physically to save her soul – if, indeed, such salvation is even possible for her, because (my voice trembles as I tell you) this girl, this child, born in a Christian country, is worse than many young pagans who pray to Brahma and kneel before Juggernaut – this girl is... a liar!”",

I might have succeeded in going unnoticed if my slate hadn’t slipped from my hands, falling loudly to the floor and drawing everyone’s attention to me. I realized then that it was hopeless. As I bent down to pick up the pieces of my broken slate, I prepared myself for whatever might come next. It happened at once. \n\n“Such carelessness!” exclaimed Mr. Brocklehurst, and then added, “Ah, it’s the new student.” Without giving me a chance to recover, he continued, “I have something to say about her.” Then, in a voice that sounded booming to my ears, he said, “Will the girl who broke her slate come forward?”\n\nI was frozen with fear and couldn’t move on my own, but the two older girls sitting beside me helped me stand and pushed me toward Mr. Brocklehurst. Miss Temple kindly guided me the rest of the way to him and whispered, “Don’t worry, Jane, I saw it was an accident; you won’t be punished.” The kindness in her words pierced me deeply. I thought, “In a moment, she’ll despise me for a hypocrite,” and I felt a surge of anger toward Mrs. Reed, Mr. Brocklehurst, and everyone else responsible for my distress. I was not like Helen Burns.\n\nMr. Brocklehurst instructed, “Bring that stool,” pointing to a tall one from which a student had just stood up. It was brought over. “Have the girl stand on it.” I was lifted onto it—I can’t recall by whom—as I was in such shock I couldn’t pay attention to details. I was now raised to the level of Mr. Brocklehurst’s face, with many well-dressed ladies and girls looking up at me from below.\n\nMr. Brocklehurst cleared his throat. “Ladies,” he addressed his family, “Miss Temple, staff, and pupils, do you see this girl?” Of course they did; I could feel everyone’s eyes burning into me.\n\n“You can see she is just a child like the rest of you, with no unusual deformity. Yet, sadly, I must inform you that she is already under the influence of evil.”\n\nHe paused, and I started to regain my composure, realizing I had to face what would happen next with determination.\n\n“My dear children,” continued Mr. Brocklehurst solemnly, “this is truly sad, for I must caution you that this girl, who might have been an innocent, is nonetheless to be considered a castaway—not one of the good flock but an outsider. You must beware of her and avoid following her example—even keep away from her, not including her in your activities or conversations. Teachers, closely monitor her behavior and discipline her in the hope that her soul might be saved, although I doubt it. For, though she comes from a Christian country—worse than a heathen child—this girl is, I regret to say, a liar!”"

Turning at the door, my judge said—\n“Let her stand half-an-hour longer on that stool, and let no one speak to her during the remainder of the day.”\nThere was I, then, mounted aloft; I, who had said I could not bear the shame of standing on my natural feet in the middle of the room, was now exposed to general view on a pedestal of infamy. What my sensations were, no language can describe; but just as they all rose, stifling my breath and constricting my throat, a girl came up and passed me: in passing, she lifted her eyes. What a strange light inspired them! What an extraordinary sensation that ray sent through me! How the new feeling bore me up! It was as if a martyr, a hero, had passed a slave or victim, and imparted strength in the transit. I mastered the rising hysteria, lifted up my head, and took a firm stand on the stool. Helen Burns asked some slight question about her work of Miss Smith, was chidden for the triviality of the inquiry, returned to her place, and smiled at me as she again went by. What a smile! I remember it now, and I know that it was the effluence of fine intellect, of true courage; it lit up her marked lineaments, her thin face, her sunken grey eye, like a reflection from the aspect of an angel. Yet at that moment Helen Burns wore on her arm “the untidy badge;” scarcely an hour ago I had heard her condemned by Miss Scatcherd to a dinner of bread and water on the morrow because she had blotted an exercise in copying it out. Such is the imperfect nature of man! such spots are there on the disc of the clearest planet; and eyes like Miss Scatcherd’s can only see those minute defects, and are blind to the full brightness of the orb.",
          "paraphrase_gemini-2.5-flash-preview-04-17": "There was a ten-minute break during which I, now fully alert, watched all the Brocklehurst women pull out their handkerchiefs and dab their eyes, while the older woman rocked back and forth and the two younger ones whispered in shock. Mr. Brocklehurst then continued, explaining that he had learned this information from her former guardian, a devout and kind woman who had adopted Jane when she was an orphan and raised her as her own child. However, the unhappy girl had repaid this kindness and generosity with such profound ingratitude that her excellent patroness was eventually forced to separate her from her own young children, fearing Jane's wicked influence would corrupt them. She sent Jane here to be reformed, much like the ancient Jews sent their sick to the healing pool of Bethesda; and Mr. Brocklehurst implored the teachers and superintendent not to let her remain untouched by the school's influence. After this grand declaration, Mr. Brocklehurst adjusted his coat button, murmured something to his family, who stood up, bowed to Miss Temple, and then the important group swept out of the room with dignity. As he turned at the door, my judge announced, 'Let her remain on that stool for another half hour, and no one is to speak to her for the rest of the day.' So there I stood, elevated for all to see; I, who had claimed I couldn't bear the shame of merely standing on the floor in the center of the room, was now publicly exposed on a platform of disgrace. My feelings at that moment are impossible to describe; but just as they overwhelmed me, stifling my breath and tightening my throat, a girl approached and walked past me. As she went by, she raised her eyes and looked at me. What a peculiar light shone in them! What an extraordinary sensation that look sent through me! How this new feeling lifted my spirits! It felt as though a brave hero or martyr had passed a slave or victim, giving strength during the passage. I managed to control my rising panic, lifted my head, and stood firmly on the stool. Helen Burns asked Miss Smith a trivial question about her work, was scolded for the minor inquiry, returned to her spot, and smiled at me again as she passed. What a smile! I remember it still, and I know it radiated from a brilliant mind and true courage; it illuminated her distinct features, her thin face, and her deep-set grey eye, like the reflection of an angel's face. Yet, at that very moment, Helen Burns wore the 'untidy badge' on her arm; barely an hour earlier, I had heard Miss Scatcherd condemn her to a dinner of bread and water the next day because she had smeared a page while copying an exercise. This illustrates the flawed nature of humanity; such imperfections exist even on the brightest stars, and eyes like Miss Scatcherd’s can only perceive these tiny defects, blind to the star's complete radiance.",
          "paraphrase_gpt-4.1-2025-04-14": "After a ten-minute silence, during which I regained my composure, I noticed all the female Brocklehursts pulling out their handkerchiefs to dab at their eyes, while the older lady rocked herself, and the two younger women whispered to each other how appalling everything was. Then Mr. Brocklehurst began to speak again. He explained that my benefactress— the charitable woman who had raised me as her own child after I was orphaned— had been forced to separate me from her family because my ingratitude was so intense and awful that she feared I would corrupt her children's goodness. She had sent me to this school to be reformed, just like in the Bible when the sick were brought to the healing pool of Bethesda; he urged the teachers not to let my presence ruin the school. Concluding his speech, Mr. Brocklehurst fastened his coat, murmured to his family, and they all grandly left the room after bowing to Miss Temple. At the door, Mr. Brocklehurst added that I should remain standing on the stool for another half an hour and that no one should speak to me for the rest of the day.\n\nI was left on display, elevated on a stool, feeling humiliated and exposed. My feelings were indescribable, and as overwhelming emotion threatened to overtake me, a girl passed by, looking at me with eyes full of a strange, inspiring light. That gaze gave me strength, like a hero giving courage to a victim. I controlled my emotions, held my head high, and resolved to stand firm. Helen Burns then asked Miss Smith a small question about her work, was gently rebuked for it, returned to her seat, and smiled at me—a smile I will never forget, as it radiated intelligence and real bravery, lighting up her thin, marked features and grey eyes to appear almost angelic. Ironically, Helen herself was being punished: she wore the 'untidy' badge on her arm and had recently been sentenced by Miss Scatcherd to a meager dinner for a minor mistake. This shows how flawed people are; even the brightest soul can be unfairly judged by those who only see small faults, missing the person’s true goodness."

          "text_segment": "Ere the half-hour ended, five o’clock struck; school was dismissed, and all were gone into the refectory to tea. I now ventured to descend: it was deep dusk; I retired into a corner and sat down on the floor. The spell by which I had been so far supported began to dissolve; reaction took place, and soon, so overwhelming was the grief that seized me, I sank prostrate with my face to the ground. Now I wept: Helen Burns was not here; nothing sustained me; left to myself I abandoned myself, and my tears watered the boards. I had meant to be so good, and to do so much at Lowood: to make so many friends, to earn respect and win affection. Already I had made visible progress: that very morning I had reached the head of my class; Miss Miller had praised me warmly; Miss Temple had smiled approbation; she had promised to teach me drawing, and to let me learn French, if I continued to make similar improvement two months longer: and then I was well received by my fellow-pupils; treated as an equal by those of my own age, and not molested by any; now, here I lay again crushed and trodden on; and could I ever rise more?\n“Never,” I thought; and ardently I wished to die. While sobbing out this wish in broken accents, some one approached: I started up—again Helen Burns was near me; the fading fires just showed her coming up the long, vacant room; she brought my coffee and bread.\n“Come, eat something,” she said; but I put both away from me, feeling as if a drop or a crumb would have choked me in my present condition. Helen regarded me, probably with surprise: I could not now abate my agitation, though I tried hard; I continued to weep aloud. She sat down on the ground near me, embraced her knees with her arms, and rested her head upon them; in that attitude she remained silent as an Indian. I was the first who spoke—\n“Helen, why do you stay with a girl whom everybody believes to be a liar?”\n“Everybody, Jane? Why, there are only eighty people who have heard you called so, and the world contains hundreds of millions.”\n“But what have I to do with millions? The eighty I know despise me.”\n“Jane, you are mistaken: probably not one in the school either despises or dislikes you: many, I am sure, pity you much.”\n“How can they pity me after what Mr. Brocklehurst has said?”\n“Mr. Brocklehurst is not a god: nor is he even a great and admired man: he is little liked here; he never took steps to make himself liked. Had he treated you as an especial favourite, you would have found enemies, declared or covert, all around you; as it is, the greater number would offer you sympathy if they dared. Teachers and pupils may look coldly on you for a day or two, but friendly feelings are concealed in their hearts; and if you persevere in doing well, these feelings will ere long appear so much the more evidently for their temporary suppression. Besides, Jane”—she paused.\n“Well, Helen?” said I, putting my hand into hers: she chafed my fingers gently to warm them, and went on—\n“If all the world hated you, and believed you wicked, while your own conscience approved you, and absolved you from guilt, you would not be without friends.”\n“No; I know I should think well of myself; but that is not enough: if others don’t love me I would rather die than live—I cannot bear to be solitary and hated, Helen. Look here; to gain some real affection from you, or Miss Temple, or any other whom I truly love, I would willingly submit to have the bone of my arm broken, or to let a bull toss me, or to stand behind a kicking horse, and let it dash its hoof at my chest—”\n“Hush, Jane! you think too much of the love of human beings; you are too impulsive, too vehement; the sovereign hand that created your frame, and put life into it, has provided you with other resources than your feeble self, or than creatures feeble as you. Besides this earth, and besides the race of men, there is an invisible world and a kingdom of spirits: that world is round us, for it is everywhere; and those spirits watch us, for they are commissioned to guard us; and if we were dying in pain and shame, if scorn smote us on all sides, and hatred crushed us, angels see our tortures, recognise our innocence (if innocent we be: as I know you are of this charge which Mr. Brocklehurst has weakly and pompously repeated at second-hand from Mrs. Reed; for I read a sincere nature in your ardent eyes and on your clear front), and God waits only the separation of spirit from flesh to crown us with a full reward. Why, then, should we ever sink overwhelmed with distress, when life is so soon over, and death is so certain an entrance to happiness—to glory?”",
          "paraphrase_gemini-2.5-flash-preview-04-17": "Before the half-hour was up, five o'clock struck, school was finished, and everyone had gone to the dining hall for tea. I felt safe enough to come down then; it was already quite dark. I found a corner and sat on the floor. The strength that had kept me going up to this point began to fade. The emotional backlash hit, and soon I was so overwhelmed by grief that I collapsed face-down on the floor. Now I could finally cry. Helen Burns wasn't there to support me; nothing was. Left alone, I gave in to my feelings, and my tears soaked the floorboards. I had planned to be so good and achieve so much at Lowood: to make lots of friends, earn respect, and be liked. I had already made clear progress; that very morning, I had been first in my class. Miss Miller had praised me highly, and Miss Temple had shown her approval with a smile. She had even promised to teach me drawing and allow me to learn French if I continued to improve at the same rate for two more months. Plus, my classmates had accepted me well; those my age treated me as an equal, and none bothered me. But now, here I was again, crushed and stepped on. Could I ever recover? \"Never,\" I thought, and I desperately wished I could die. While choking out this wish in broken sobs, someone approached. I jumped up. It was Helen Burns again. The dying light from the fires just showed her coming down the long, empty room. She was carrying my coffee and bread. \"Come, eat something,\" she said. But I pushed them away, feeling like even a tiny bit would choke me in my state. Helen looked at me, likely surprised. I couldn't control my distress, even though I tried hard; I kept weeping loudly. She sat down near me on the floor, wrapped her arms around her knees, and rested her head on them. In that position, she remained as silent as a Native American. I was the first to speak. \"Helen, why do you stay with a girl everyone thinks is a liar?\" \"Everyone, Jane?\" she replied. \"Why, only eighty people have heard you called that, and the world has hundreds of millions.\" \"But what do millions have to do with me? The eighty I know despise me.\" \"Jane, you are mistaken. Probably not one person in the school despises or dislikes you. Many, I'm sure, feel great pity for you.\" \"How can they pity me after what Mr. Brocklehurst said?\" \"Mr. Brocklehurst isn't a god, nor is he even a great and admired person. He is not well-liked here; he never tried to make himself liked. If he had treated you as a special favourite, you would have found enemies everywhere, both open and hidden. As it is, most people would offer you sympathy if they dared. Teachers and students might seem distant for a day or two, but friendly feelings are hidden in their hearts. If you keep doing well, these feelings will show themselves all the more clearly because they were temporarily held back. Besides, Jane,\" she paused. \"Well, Helen?\" I said, putting my hand in hers. She gently rubbed my fingers to warm them and continued, \"If the entire world hated you and thought you wicked, but your own conscience approved of you and cleared you of guilt, you would still have support.\" \"No,\" I said. \"I know I would think well of myself, but that's not enough. If others don't love me, I'd rather die than live. I can't stand being alone and hated, Helen. Look, to gain genuine affection from you, or Miss Temple, or anyone else I truly love, I would willingly let my arm bone be broken, or let a bull toss me, or stand behind a kicking horse and let its hoof hit my chest-\" \"Hush, Jane! You worry too much about human love. You are too impulsive, too intense. The mighty power that created you and gave you life has given you other strengths besides your weak self or other weak creatures like you. Beyond this earth and the human race, there is an unseen world and a realm of spirits. That world surrounds us because it is everywhere, and those spirits watch us because they are assigned to protect us. Even if we were dying in pain and shame, if we were scorned on all sides and crushed by hatred, angels see our suffering, recognise our innocence (if we are innocent, which I know you are of this charge Mr. Brocklehurst weakly and pompously repeated second-hand from Mrs. Reed; I see a truthful nature in your passionate eyes and clear face), and God is just waiting for the spirit to leave the body to reward us fully. Why, then, should we ever be overwhelmed by sadness when life is so short, and death is such a sure path to happiness, to glory?\"",

Only then did I dare to come downstairs. It was already quite dark, so I withdrew to a corner and sat on the floor. Whatever had been sustaining me until then began to fade; I experienced a wave of reaction, and my sorrow became so intense that I collapsed, facedown on the ground. Now, at last, I cried: Helen Burns wasn't with me; I had no support; alone, I gave in to my misery, and my tears soaked the floor. I had intended to behave well and achieve much at Lowood—to gain friends, earn respect, and be liked. I had already made progress: just that morning I’d been at the top of my class; Miss Miller had praised me warmly, Miss Temple smiled approvingly, promising to teach me drawing and let me study French if I kept improving for two more months. My classmates welcomed me and treated me as an equal; no one bothered me. But now, here I was again, crushed and beaten down. Would I ever recover? 'Never,' I thought, desperately wishing for death. Sobbing this wish aloud, someone came near me; I looked up—Helen Burns was there. Dim light revealed her approaching down the empty room, bringing coffee and bread. 'Come, eat something,' she urged, but I rejected both, feeling I couldn't swallow anything in my state. Helen looked at me, probably surprised; I couldn't calm myself despite trying, and I continued to cry out loud. She sat down beside me, hugging her knees and resting her head, remaining silent. I broke the silence first: 'Helen, why do you stay with someone everyone calls a liar?' 'Everyone, Jane? Only eighty people have heard it, and there are hundreds of millions in the world.' 'But what does that matter? The eighty I know despise me.' 'You're mistaken, Jane; probably not one person here despises or dislikes you. Many likely pity you deeply.' 'How could they, after what Mr. Brocklehurst said?' 'Mr. Brocklehurst isn't a god, nor is he well liked here; he has never tried to be. If he'd shown you special favor, you'd have made enemies everywhere; as it is, most would give you sympathy if they dared. Teachers and students might seem cold for a few days, but their friendly feelings are just hidden for now; if you keep doing well, those feelings will soon emerge, all the stronger for being suppressed. Plus, Jane—' she paused. 'Yes, Helen?' I said, taking her hand; she gently rubbed mine to warm them and continued— 'Even if the whole world hated and judged you, as long as your conscience approved and absolved you, you’d never truly be alone.' 'No; I know I’d respect myself. But that’s not enough: if I’m not loved, I’d rather die than live—I can’t bear being alone and hated, Helen. To get real affection from you, Miss Temple, or anyone I care about, I'd let my arm be broken, be tossed by a bull, or stand behind a kicking horse and risk being trampled.' 'Hush, Jane! You rely too much on human affection; you’re too passionate and intense. The God that created you has given you more resources than just your own frailty or the weakness of others like you. Beyond this world and humanity, there is an invisible realm and a host of spirits: it surrounds us, everywhere. Those spirits watch over us, instructed to protect us; and if we are dying in pain and disgrace, hated and scorned, angels witness our suffering and recognize our innocence (if we are indeed innocent—I believe you are, as I see your sincerity in your eyes and face). God simply waits to reward us fully when our souls part from our bodies. So why should we ever give in to despair, when life is brief and death certain to lead to happiness and glory?\""

          "text_segment": "I was silent; Helen had calmed me; but in the tranquillity she imparted there was an alloy of inexpressible sadness. I felt the impression of woe as she spoke, but I could not tell whence it came; and when, having done speaking, she breathed a little fast and coughed a short cough, I momentarily forgot my own sorrows to yield to a vague concern for her.\nResting my head on Helen’s shoulder, I put my arms round her waist; she drew me to her, and we reposed in silence. We had not sat long thus, when another person came in. Some heavy clouds, swept from the sky by a rising wind, had left the moon bare; and her light, streaming in through a window near, shone full both on us and on the approaching figure, which we at once recognised as Miss Temple.\n“I came on purpose to find you, Jane Eyre,” said she; “I want you in my room; and as Helen Burns is with you, she may come too.”\nWe went; following the superintendent’s guidance, we had to thread some intricate passages, and mount a staircase before we reached her apartment; it contained a good fire, and looked cheerful. Miss Temple told Helen Burns to be seated in a low arm-chair on one side of the hearth, and herself taking another, she called me to her side.\n“Is it all over?” she asked, looking down at my face. “Have you cried your grief away?”\n“I am afraid I never shall do that.”\n“Why?”\n“Because I have been wrongly accused; and you, ma’am, and everybody else, will now think me wicked.”\n“We shall think you what you prove yourself to be, my child. Continue to act as a good girl, and you will satisfy us.”\n“Shall I, Miss Temple?”\n“You will,” said she, passing her arm round me. “And now tell me who is the lady whom Mr. Brocklehurst called your benefactress?”\n“Mrs. Reed, my uncle’s wife. My uncle is dead, and he left me to her care.”\n“Did she not, then, adopt you of her own accord?”\n“No, ma’am; she was sorry to have to do it: but my uncle, as I have often heard the servants say, got her to promise before he died that she would always keep me.”\n“Well now, Jane, you know, or at least I will tell you, that when a criminal is accused, he is always allowed to speak in his own defence. You have been charged with falsehood; defend yourself to me as well as you can. Say whatever your memory suggests is true; but add nothing and exaggerate nothing.”\nI resolved, in the depth of my heart, that I would be most moderate—most correct; and, having reflected a few minutes in order to arrange coherently what I had to say, I told her all the story of my sad childhood. Exhausted by emotion, my language was more subdued than it generally was when it developed that sad theme; and mindful of Helen’s warnings against the indulgence of resentment, I infused into the narrative far less of gall and wormwood than ordinary. Thus restrained and simplified, it sounded more credible: I felt as I went on that Miss Temple fully believed me.\nIn the course of the tale I had mentioned Mr. Lloyd as having come to see me after the fit: for I never forgot the, to me, frightful episode of the red-room: in detailing which, my excitement was sure, in some degree, to break bounds; for nothing could soften in my recollection the spasm of agony which clutched my heart when Mrs. Reed spurned my wild supplication for pardon, and locked me a second time in the dark and haunted chamber.",

I sensed the sadness as she spoke, though I didn't know why; and when, after finishing, she breathed quickly and gave a slight cough, I momentarily forgot my own problems, feeling a vague concern for her instead. Resting my head on Helen's shoulder, I put my arms around her waist; she hugged me close, and we sat in silence. We hadn't been like this long when someone else entered. Heavy clouds, blown away by a rising wind, had left the moon visible; its light, streaming in from a nearby window, shone directly on us and on the approaching figure, whom we immediately recognized as Miss Temple. She said, 'I came specifically to find you, Jane Eyre; I need you in my room; and since Helen Burns is with you, she can join us.' We followed the superintendent's lead, having to navigate several complicated corridors and climb stairs to reach her apartment, which felt cheerful and had a good fire burning. Miss Temple told Helen Burns to sit in a low armchair by the hearth, and taking another herself, she called me to her side. 'Is it all over?' she asked, looking at my face. 'Have you cried away your sadness?' I replied, 'I'm afraid I never will.' 'Why?' she questioned. 'Because I've been wrongly accused,' I explained, 'and now you, ma'am, and everyone else, will consider me wicked.' 'My child,' she said, 'we will judge you based on what you prove yourself to be. Continue to act like a good girl, and you will satisfy us.' 'Shall I, Miss Temple?' I asked. 'You will,' she confirmed, putting her arm around me. 'And now tell me who the lady is that Mr. Brocklehurst called your benefactress.' 'Mrs. Reed, my uncle's wife,' I answered. 'My uncle is deceased, and he left me in her care.' 'So, she didn't adopt you willingly?' Miss Temple inquired. 'No, ma'am,' I replied. 'She was reluctant to do it, but my uncle, as I often heard the servants say, made her promise before he died that she would always keep me.' 'Well now, Jane,' Miss Temple began, 'you know, or I will tell you, that when a criminal is accused, they are always permitted to speak in their own defense. You have been accused of lying; defend yourself to me as thoroughly as you can. State whatever your memory suggests is true, but add nothing and exaggerate nothing.' Deep in my heart, I resolved to be extremely moderate and accurate. After reflecting for a few minutes to organize my thoughts clearly, I recounted the entire story of my unhappy childhood. My voice was more subdued than usual, worn down by emotion, as I described that sad period; and remembering Helen's warnings against dwelling on resentment, I included far less bitterness than usual in the narrative. Presented this way, restrained and simplified, it sounded more believable: I felt as I spoke that Miss Temple fully believed me. In the course of my story, I had mentioned Mr. Lloyd visiting me after the fit, as I could never forget the terrifying episode of the red-room. When detailing this part, my excitement was bound to break through to some degree, for nothing could diminish in my memory the intense agony that seized my heart when Mrs. Reed coldly rejected my desperate plea for forgiveness and locked me back in the dark, supposedly haunted chamber a second time.",
          "paraphrase_gpt-4.1-2025-04-14": "I remained quiet after Helen comforted me, but her calmness brought with it a deep, indescribable sadness. As she spoke, I sensed a sorrow I couldn’t quite understand; and when she finished, breathing quickly and coughing a little, my own troubles faded as I grew concerned for her instead.\n\nI laid my head on Helen’s shoulder and hugged her, and she held me close. We sat together quietly until Miss Temple entered. The clouds had cleared from the sky, letting the moonlight shine in, illuminating us and making it easy to recognize Miss Temple as she approached.\n\n“I came here to find you, Jane Eyre,” she said. “I want you in my room, and since Helen Burns is with you, she may join us.”\n\nWe followed Miss Temple through complicated hallways and up some stairs to her cozy room, which had a warm fire and a cheerful atmosphere. She told Helen to sit in a low chair by the fire, sat down herself, and called me to her side.\n\n“Is everything finished?” she asked, looking at me. “Have you cried away your sadness?”\n\n“I don't think I’ll ever be able to do that,” I answered.\n\n“Why?”\n\n“Because I’ve been unfairly accused, and now you and everyone else will think I’m bad.”\n\n“We will think of you as you prove yourself to be, my dear. Keep behaving well, and you will please us.”\n\n“Will I, Miss Temple?”\n\n“You will,” she replied, putting her arm around me. “Now, tell me who Mr. Brocklehurst called your benefactress?”\n\n“Mrs. Reed, my uncle’s wife. My uncle passed away, and left me in her care.”\n\n“So she didn’t choose to adopt you herself?”\n\n“No, she didn’t want to; she only did it because my uncle made her promise before he died.”\n\n“Jane, you know that when someone is accused of a crime, they’re allowed to defend themselves. You’ve been accused of lying; defend yourself to me as best you can. Only say what you remember is true; don’t add or exaggerate.”\n\nDetermined to be moderate and accurate, I took a few minutes to collect my thoughts, then recounted my unhappy childhood to her. Worn out by emotion, I spoke more gently than I usually did on this topic, and remembered Helen’s advice not to harbor resentment, so I told my story without bitterness. This made it seem more believable, and as I spoke, I felt Miss Temple trusted me.\n\nI mentioned Mr. Lloyd’s visit after my fainting spell—an event I couldn’t forget, especially being locked in the terrifying red-room by Mrs. Reed. Telling this part of my story, my emotions nearly ran away with me, for nothing could ease the pain I remembered when Mrs. Reed refused my begging for forgiveness and locked me in the dark, haunted room a second time."

Have you coughed much to-day?”\n“Not quite so much, I think, ma’am.”\n“And the pain in your chest?”\n“It is a little better.”\nMiss Temple got up, took her hand and examined her pulse; then she returned to her own seat: as she resumed it, I heard her sigh low.

How pretty, to my eyes, did the china cups and bright teapot look, placed on the little round table near the fire! How fragrant was the steam of the beverage, and the scent of the toast! of which, however, I, to my dismay (for I was beginning to be hungry) discerned only a very small portion: Miss Temple discerned it too.\n“Barbara,” said she, “can you not bring a little more bread and butter? There is not enough for three.”\nBarbara went out: she returned soon—\n“Madam, Mrs. Harden says she has sent up the usual quantity.”\nMrs. Harden, be it observed, was the housekeeper: a woman after Mr. Brocklehurst’s own heart, made up of equal parts of whalebone and iron.\n“Oh, very well!” returned Miss Temple; “we must make it do, Barbara, I suppose.” And as the girl withdrew she added, smiling, “Fortunately, I have it in my power to supply deficiencies for this once.”\nHaving invited Helen and me to approach the table, and placed before each of us a cup of tea with one delicious but thin morsel of toast, she got up, unlocked a drawer, and taking from it a parcel wrapped in paper, disclosed presently to our eyes a good-sized seed-cake.\n“I meant to give each of you some of this to take with you,” said she, “but as there is so little toast, you must have it now,” and she proceeded to cut slices with a generous hand.\nWe feasted that evening as on nectar and ambrosia; and not the least delight of the entertainment was the smile of gratification with which our hostess regarded us, as we satisfied our famished appetites on the delicate fare she liberally supplied.",

However, Jane, you are already cleared in my eyes.\" She then kissed me and kept me standing beside her. I was happy there, finding simple joy in admiring her appearance – her clothes, her few pieces of jewelry, her fair skin, her thick, shiny curls, and her bright dark eyes. Next, she turned to Helen Burns and asked, \"How are you feeling this evening, Helen? Did you cough much today?\" Helen replied, \"Not as much, I think, ma'am.\" \"And the soreness in your chest?\" Miss Temple inquired. \"It's a little better,\" Helen answered. Miss Temple rose, held Helen's hand, and checked her pulse before returning to her seat. As she sat down, I heard a soft sigh from her, and she seemed lost in thought for a few moments. Then, she roused herself and said cheerfully, \"But you two are my guests tonight, and I must treat you accordingly.\" She rang her bell. When the servant, Barbara, arrived, Miss Temple instructed her, \"I haven't had tea yet; please bring the tray and set cups for these two young ladies.\" Soon after, a tray appeared. To my eyes, the china cups and shining teapot on the small round table by the fire looked delightful. The scent of the tea and the toast was wonderful, though to my disappointment (as I was getting hungry), I saw only a very small amount of toast. Miss Temple noticed it too. \"Barbara,\" she said, \"could you please bring a little more bread and butter? There isn't enough for three.\" Barbara left and quickly returned, reporting, \"Madam, Mrs. Harden says she sent the usual portion.\" Mrs. Harden, it should be noted, was the housekeeper and a severe woman, much like Mr. Brocklehurst, seeming to be made of stiffness and rigidity. \"Oh, alright then!\" Miss Temple replied. \"We'll have to make do, Barbara, I suppose.\" As the girl left, she added with a smile, \"Fortunately, I can make up for the shortage on this occasion.\" Inviting Helen and me to the table and placing a cup of tea and one small, delicious piece of toast before each of us, she got up, unlocked a drawer, and took out a paper-wrapped package. From it, she revealed a good-sized seed-cake. \"I intended to give you both some of this to take with you,\" she explained, \"but since there's so little toast, you should have it now.\" She then proceeded to cut generous slices.

Next, she spoke to Helen Burns, asking how she was feeling and if her cough or chest pain had improved. Helen replied that her cough was a bit better and the pain was improving. Miss Temple checked Helen’s pulse and then sat back down, sighing softly and appearing thoughtful for a short while. Soon, she brightened and reminded us that we were her guests for the evening, summoning a servant, Barbara, to bring tea and cups for us. The tray was soon brought in, and I marveled at the pretty china and the pleasing aroma of tea and toast, though to my disappointment there was hardly any toast for us to share—a fact Miss Temple also noticed. She asked for more bread and butter, but Barbara reported that Mrs. Harden, the strict housekeeper, had sent only the usual amount. Miss Temple accepted this with a smile, assuring us that she could make up for the shortage this time. She invited us to sit at the table, served us each tea and a small piece of toast, and then unlocked a drawer to bring out a large seed-cake. She explained she had planned to give us the cake to take home, but, given the lack of toast, would share it with us now, cutting generous slices. That evening, we enjoyed our meal as if it were a divine feast, made all the more pleasant by Miss Temple’s evident pleasure at seeing us eat so happily."

They woke, they kindled: first, they glowed in the bright tint of her cheek, which till this hour I had never seen but pale and bloodless; then they shone in the liquid lustre of her eyes, which had suddenly acquired a beauty more singular than that of Miss Temple’s—a beauty neither of fine colour nor long eyelash, nor pencilled brow, but of meaning, of movement, of radiance. Then her soul sat on her lips, and language flowed, from what source I cannot tell. Has a girl of fourteen a heart large enough, vigorous enough, to hold the swelling spring of pure, full, fervid eloquence? Such was the characteristic of Helen’s discourse on that, to me, memorable evening; her spirit seemed hastening to live within a very brief span as much as many live during a protracted existence.\nThey conversed of things I had never heard of; of nations and times past; of countries far away; of secrets of nature discovered or guessed at: they spoke of books: how many they had read! What stores of knowledge they possessed! Then they seemed so familiar with French names and French authors: but my amazement reached its climax when Miss Temple asked Helen if she sometimes snatched a moment to recall the Latin her father had taught her, and taking a book from a shelf, bade her read and construe a page of Virgil; and Helen obeyed, my organ of veneration expanding at every sounding line. She had scarcely finished ere the bell announced bedtime! no delay could be admitted; Miss Temple embraced us both, saying, as she drew us to her heart—\n“God bless you, my children!”\nHelen she held a little longer than me: she let her go more reluctantly; it was Helen her eye followed to the door; it was for her she a second time breathed a sad sigh; for her she wiped a tear from her cheek.",

What followed was a conversation between her and Helen that felt like a rare privilege to witness. Miss Temple consistently displayed a calm and dignified presence, and her language was always refined, preventing any tendency towards passionate or excited expression. Her demeanor inspired respect and tempered the enjoyment of those around her with a sense of reverence; this was how I felt at that moment. However, I was filled with astonishment regarding Helen Burns. The nourishing meal, the warm fire, being in the company of her beloved teacher, or perhaps something deeper within her own unique mind, had awakened her inner energies. They came alive, ignited. First, this was visible in the bright flush on her cheeks, which until then I had only ever seen pale and lacking color. Then, it shone in the clear brightness of her eyes, which suddenly possessed a beauty more extraordinary than Miss Temple’s—a beauty not of color, long lashes, or shaped brows, but of profound meaning, lively expression, and inner light. Her very soul seemed to speak through her lips, and language flowed from a source I couldn't comprehend. Can a fourteen-year-old girl truly possess a heart large and strong enough to contain such a surging source of pure, rich, passionate eloquence? This was the nature of Helen’s discourse on that evening, which remains unforgettable to me. Her spirit seemed determined to live as much within a very short lifespan as many people do over a long existence. They discussed topics I had never heard of: ancient civilizations and historical periods, distant lands, scientific discoveries or theories. They spoke of books, revealing how extensively they had read and the vast knowledge they had accumulated. They also seemed remarkably familiar with French names and writers. My amazement reached its peak when Miss Temple asked Helen if she ever found time to practice the Latin her father had taught her, then took a book from a shelf and instructed her to read and translate a page of Virgil. Helen complied, and my sense of admiration deepened with every line she uttered. They had scarcely finished when the bell rang for bedtime! There was no possibility of delay. Miss Temple hugged us both, drawing us close and saying, “God bless you, my children!” She held Helen a little longer than me, releasing her more reluctantly. It was Helen her gaze followed to the door; for her she sighed sadly a second time; for her she wiped a tear from her cheek.",

She inspired in observers a subtle sense of reverence, and I felt exactly that as I listened. But as for Helen Burns, I was amazed. Whether it was the good meal, the warm fire, or simply Miss Temple’s kind presence—or perhaps something special within Helen herself—she seemed energized. Her face, usually pale, now glowed with color, and her eyes shone with a unique radiance and expression, outshining even Miss Temple’s. Her words flowed effortlessly, with a passion and eloquence I could scarcely believe possible in a girl so young. Helen’s conversation, that night, was remarkable—she seemed to be living more deeply in those moments than most people do in years. They spoke about topics unfamiliar to me: histories, faraway lands, mysteries of nature discovered or imagined, and many books they had read, displaying knowledge that astonished me. They also discussed French authors and language with ease. My astonishment peaked when Miss Temple asked Helen if she ever recalled her father's Latin lessons, and then had her read and translate a page of Virgil. Helen did so, and I listened with growing admiration. She had hardly finished when the bell called us to bed. There was no delay—Miss Temple hugged us both tightly, saying, “God bless you, my children!” She held Helen longer than she held me, and reluctantly let her go, following her with her eyes, sighing again and wiping away a tear for her."

The teachers then shook hands with me and kissed me, and a murmur of pleasure ran through the ranks of my companions.\nThus relieved of a grievous load, I from that hour set to work afresh, resolved to pioneer my way through every difficulty: I toiled hard, and my success was proportionate to my efforts; my memory, not naturally tenacious, improved with practice; exercise sharpened my wits; in a few weeks I was promoted to a higher class; in less than two months I was allowed to commence French and drawing. I learned the first two tenses of the verb Etre, and sketched my first cottage (whose walls, by-the-bye, outrivalled in slope those of the leaning tower of Pisa), on the same day. That night, on going to bed, I forgot to prepare in imagination the Barmecide supper of hot roast potatoes, or white bread and new milk, with which I was wont to amuse my inward cravings: I feasted instead on the spectacle of ideal drawings, which I saw in the dark; all the work of my own hands: freely pencilled houses and trees, picturesque rocks and ruins, Cuyp-like groups of cattle, sweet paintings of butterflies hovering over unblown roses, of birds picking at ripe cherries, of wren’s nests enclosing pearl-like eggs, wreathed about with young ivy sprays.

The instructors then congratulated me with handshakes and kisses, and my classmates expressed their relief and happiness with a quiet murmur. Lifted from this heavy burden, I immediately dedicated myself anew, determined to overcome any obstacle. I worked diligently, and my progress was commensurate with my efforts. My memory, not naturally strong, improved through regular practice; exercise sharpened my intellect. Within a few weeks, I moved up to a more advanced class, and in less than two months, I was permitted to begin studying French and drawing. I mastered the first two tenses of the verb 'Etre' and drew my first cottage (whose walls, incidentally, were more slanted than the Leaning Tower of Pisa) on the same day. That evening, upon retiring, I neglected to mentally prepare the phantom feast of hot roast potatoes, or white bread and new milk, with which I typically entertained my hunger pangs. Instead, I savored the mental image of perfect drawings I envisioned in the darkness—all created by my own hands: freely sketched houses and trees, picturesque rocks and ancient structures, groups of cattle reminiscent of Cuyp, charming depictions of butterflies fluttering over unopened roses, of birds pecking at ripe cherries, of wrens' nests holding pearly eggs, encircled by young ivy tendrils. I also contemplated whether I might ever be able to fluidly translate a particular small French story that Madame Pierrot had shown me earlier that day.

The teachers congratulated me warmly, and my classmates expressed their happiness. Feeling as though a heavy burden had been lifted, I started working with renewed determination, intent on overcoming every obstacle. I applied myself diligently and made progress in line with my efforts; my memory, though not particularly strong, improved as I practiced. Regular study made me more alert. Within a few weeks, I was promoted to a higher class, and in less than two months I began lessons in French and drawing. On my first day, I learned the first two tenses of the verb \"être\" and drew my first cottage, whose walls slanted even more than the Leaning Tower of Pisa. That night, as I went to bed, instead of imagining a fanciful meal to distract myself from hunger, I envisioned instead a gallery of imaginary drawings—all creations of my own: sketches of houses and trees, interesting landscapes, groups of cattle like those painted by Cuyp, delicate images of butterflies over budding roses, birds eating cherries, wrens’ nests filled with pearl-like eggs, all intertwined with young ivy tendrils. I also wondered whether I would eventually be able to translate fluently a certain little French story Madame Pierrot had shown me that day; and I was still considering this when I drifted off to sleep."

Spring drew on: she was indeed already come; the frosts of winter had ceased; its snows were melted, its cutting winds ameliorated. My wretched feet, flayed and swollen to lameness by the sharp air of January, began to heal and subside under the gentler breathings of April; the nights and mornings no longer by their Canadian temperature froze the very blood in our veins; we could now endure the play-hour passed in the garden: sometimes on a sunny day it began even to be pleasant and genial, and a greenness grew over those brown beds, which, freshening daily, suggested the thought that Hope traversed them at night, and left each morning brighter traces of her steps. Flowers peeped out amongst the leaves; snow-drops, crocuses, purple auriculas, and golden-eyed pansies. On Thursday afternoons (half-holidays) we now took walks, and found still sweeter flowers opening by the wayside, under the hedges.\nI discovered, too, that a great pleasure, an enjoyment which the horizon only bounded, lay all outside the high and spike-guarded walls of our garden: this pleasure consisted in prospect of noble summits girdling a great hill-hollow, rich in verdure and shadow; in a bright beck, full of dark stones and sparkling eddies. How different had this scene looked when I viewed it laid out beneath the iron sky of winter, stiffened in frost, shrouded with snow!—when mists as chill as death wandered to the impulse of east winds along those purple peaks, and rolled down “ing” and holm till they blended with the frozen fog of the beck! That beck itself was then a torrent, turbid and curbless: it tore asunder the wood, and sent a raving sound through the air, often thickened with wild rain or whirling sleet; and for the forest on its banks, that showed only ranks of skeletons.\nApril advanced to May: a bright serene May it was; days of blue sky, placid sunshine, and soft western or southern gales filled up its duration. And now vegetation matured with vigour; Lowood shook loose its tresses; it became all green, all flowery; its great elm, ash, and oak skeletons were restored to majestic life; woodland plants sprang up profusely in its recesses; unnumbered varieties of moss filled its hollows, and it made a strange ground-sunshine out of the wealth of its wild primrose plants: I have seen their pale gold gleam in overshadowed spots like scatterings of the sweetest lustre. All this I enjoyed often and fully, free, unwatched, and almost alone: for this unwonted liberty and pleasure there was a cause, to which it now becomes my task to advert.",

Winter's freezing temperatures, snow, and harsh winds subsided, giving way to milder weather. My feet, previously injured and swollen from the severe January cold, started to heal and return to normal under the gentler April air. The nights and mornings were no longer so freezing that they seemed to numb our blood; we could now tolerate spending time in the garden during leisure hours. On sunny days, the garden even became pleasant and inviting, with a growing greenness replacing the brown on the flowerbeds, suggesting that hope visited nightly, leaving brighter evidence of its presence each morning. Flowers like snow-drops, crocuses, purple auriculas, and golden-eyed pansies began to emerge amongst the leaves. On Thursday afternoons, our half-holidays, we would take walks and find even lovelier flowers blooming along the paths and beneath the hedges.\n\nI also discovered a significant source of enjoyment, one that seemed limitless, extending beyond the tall, spiked walls enclosing our garden. This pleasure came from the view of the magnificent mountain peaks encircling a large, green, and shaded valley below, along with a sparkling stream containing dark stones and swirling currents. This scene looked vastly different from how it appeared under winter's harsh, grey sky, frozen stiff and covered in snow. Back then, mists as cold as death drifted with the east winds across the purple mountain tops and rolled down the slopes until they merged with the frozen fog over the stream. The stream itself was a wild, uncontrolled torrent then, tearing through the nearby woods and making a roaring sound through the air, often thick with heavy rain or driving sleet. The forest along its banks was reduced to bare, skeletal trees.\n\nApril transitioned into a beautiful, calm May. Days were filled with clear blue skies, gentle sunshine, and soft winds from the west or south. The vegetation now grew with renewed strength; Lowood shed its winter look and became lush and full of flowers. Its large elm, ash, and oak trees, which had looked like skeletons, were restored to vibrant life. Woodland plants sprouted abundantly in hidden spots, and countless types of moss filled the hollows. Wild primrose plants created a unique 'ground-sunshine,' their pale gold shining in shaded areas like scattered points of exquisite light. I frequently and fully enjoyed all this, feeling free, unsupervised, and mostly alone. There was a reason for this unusual freedom and pleasure, which I will now explain.",

Flowers like snowdrops, crocuses, auriculas, and pansies began to bloom among the leaves. On Thursday afternoons, which were our half-holidays, we would go for walks and find even more lovely flowers blooming by the roadside and under hedges.\n\nI also realized that there was great pleasure to be found beyond the tall, spiked garden walls: beautiful hills surrounded a lush valley, and a bright stream flowed over dark stones, sparkling in the sunlight. The whole scene was strikingly different from winter, when it was covered in frost and snow, with cold mists drifting over the hills and the rapid, uncontrolled stream roaring through the frozen landscape, and the trees looking like bare skeletons.\n\nAs April turned to May, the weather became bright and calm, with blue skies, gentle sunshine, and warm breezes from the west or south. The plants began to thrive; Lowood became green and full of flowers; the bare trees regained their leaves and grandeur; wild plants and many types of moss filled the woods and hollows, making the ground shine with pale yellow primroses—a sight I often delighted in, enjoying my freedom and solitude.

Most students were already susceptible to infection due to insufficient food and neglected colds: at one time, forty-five of the eighty girls were ill. Classes were discontinued, and rules were relaxed. The small number of students who remained well were permitted almost complete freedom; this was because the attending physician insisted on the need for regular exercise to maintain their health, and even if this were not the case, nobody had the capacity to monitor or control them. Miss Temple focused all her energy on the patients; she resided in the sick-room, leaving only to get a few hours of rest at night. The other teachers were completely occupied with packing and arranging for the departure of those students fortunate enough to have friends or relatives capable and willing to take them away from the infected area.

Most girls, already weakened by too little food and untreated colds, quickly fell ill—at one point, forty-five out of eighty students were sick. Normal routines were abandoned: the students who stayed healthy were given almost total freedom, since the doctor said they needed plenty of exercise, and there were too few staff to properly supervise them.

Besides, there were fewer to feed; the sick could eat little; our breakfast-basins were better filled; when there was no time to prepare a regular dinner, which often happened, she would give us a large piece of cold pie, or a thick slice of bread and cheese, and this we carried away with us to the wood, where we each chose the spot we liked best, and dined sumptuously.\nMy favourite seat was a smooth and broad stone, rising white and dry from the very middle of the beck, and only to be got at by wading through the water; a feat I accomplished barefoot. The stone was just broad enough to accommodate, comfortably, another girl and me, at that time my chosen comrade—one Mary Ann Wilson; a shrewd, observant personage, whose society I took pleasure in, partly because she was witty and original, and partly because she had a manner which set me at my ease.

The garden was also vibrant with flowers: tall hollyhocks stood like trees, lilies were open, and tulips and roses were in bloom; the edges of the small flowerbeds were cheerful with pink thrift and deep red double daisies. The sweetbriar filled the air morning and evening with its scent of spice and apples. Yet, these fragrant garden treasures were mostly useless to the girls within Lowood, serving only occasionally to provide a few herbs and blossoms for a coffin. However, I and the others who remained healthy fully appreciated the beauty of the surroundings and the season. We were allowed to wander in the woods freely, like travelers, from morning until night. We could do and go as we pleased, and our living conditions improved too. Mr. Brocklehurst and his family no longer visited Lowood, and the school's domestic affairs were not closely inspected. The unpleasant housekeeper had left, driven away by the fear of contagion. Her replacement, who had previously managed the Lowton Dispensary, was unfamiliar with the school's customs but was relatively generous with provisions. Furthermore, there were fewer students to feed since the sick ate little. Our breakfast bowls were more generously filled. When there wasn't time to prepare a full dinner, which was often the case, she would give us a large piece of cold pie or a thick slice of bread and cheese. We would take this with us to the woods, where we each chose our favourite spot and enjoyed a lavish outdoor meal. My preferred place to sit was a smooth, wide stone, standing white and dry in the very middle of the stream, reachable only by wading through the water, which I did without shoes. The stone was just wide enough to comfortably seat another girl and myself. At that time, my chosen friend was Mary Ann Wilson. She was an intelligent, sharp-witted person whose company I enjoyed, partly because she was clever and original, and partly because her manner made me feel comfortable. Being several years older than me, she knew more about the world and could share many things I was eager to hear. My curiosity was satisfied by her stories. She was also very forgiving of my faults, never attempting to restrict or control anything I said. She had a talent for storytelling, while I had a knack for understanding. She liked to explain things, and I liked to ask questions, so we got along wonderfully, finding much entertainment, if not much personal development, from our conversations.",

The students who remained healthy were allowed to freely roam the woods throughout the day, choosing their own activities and enjoying improved food, since many were too ill to eat and supervisors were absent. My preferred spot for picnicking was a flat stone in the middle of the stream, which I reached by wading through the water barefoot. I often shared this seat with Mary Ann Wilson, an insightful and amusing friend who was older and more worldly than me. She enjoyed storytelling while I preferred asking questions, and together we had lively conversations that entertained us both."

How could it be otherwise, when Helen, at all times and under all circumstances, evinced for me a quiet and faithful friendship, which ill-humour never soured, nor irritation never troubled? But Helen was ill at present: for some weeks she had been removed from my sight to I knew not what room upstairs. She was not, I was told, in the hospital portion of the house with the fever patients; for her complaint was consumption, not typhus: and by consumption I, in my ignorance, understood something mild, which time and care would be sure to alleviate.\nI was confirmed in this idea by the fact of her once or twice coming downstairs on very warm sunny afternoons, and being taken by Miss Temple into the garden; but, on these occasions, I was not allowed to go and speak to her; I only saw her from the schoolroom window, and then not distinctly; for she was much wrapped up, and sat at a distance under the verandah.",

Surely, Mary Ann Wilson, whom I'd mentioned, was not her equal; Mary Ann could only share entertaining stories and engage in lively, perhaps sharp, gossip that I might introduce. In contrast, if I am being truthful about Helen, she had the capacity to expose those fortunate enough to converse with her to insights about far more profound matters. This is true, reader, and I was fully aware of it. Although I am flawed, with many shortcomings and few strengths, I never grew tired of Helen Burns. My affection for her remained unwavering, as deep, tender, and respectful as any emotion my heart has ever held. How could it be otherwise, when Helen consistently, regardless of the circumstances, showed me a calm and loyal friendship that was never spoiled by bad moods or disturbed by irritation? However, Helen was currently unwell. For several weeks, I hadn't seen her; she had been moved to an unknown room upstairs. I was told she wasn't in the infirmary with the fever patients because her illness was consumption, not typhus. In my inexperience, I believed consumption was a minor ailment that would definitely improve with time and care. My belief was reinforced when she occasionally came downstairs on very warm, sunny afternoons and Miss Temple took her into the garden. Yet, on these occasions, I wasn't allowed to go and speak to her.

After all, Helen always showed me constant and gentle friendship, unaffected by bad moods or irritation.

When we got back, it was after moonrise: a pony, which we knew to be the surgeon’s, was standing at the garden door. Mary Ann remarked that she supposed some one must be very ill, as Mr. Bates had been sent for at that time of the evening. She went into the house; I stayed behind a few minutes to plant in my garden a handful of roots I had dug up in the forest, and which I feared would wither if I left them till the morning. This done, I lingered yet a little longer: the flowers smelt so sweet as the dew fell; it was such a pleasant evening, so serene, so warm; the still glowing west promised so fairly another fine day on the morrow; the moon rose with such majesty in the grave east. I was noting these things and enjoying them as a child might, when it entered my mind as it had never done before:—\n“How sad to be lying now on a sick bed, and to be in danger of dying! This world is pleasant—it would be dreary to be called from it, and to have to go who knows where?”\nAnd then my mind made its first earnest effort to comprehend what had been infused into it concerning heaven and hell; and for the first time it recoiled, baffled; and for the first time glancing behind, on each side, and before it, it saw all round an unfathomed gulf: it felt the one point where it stood—the present; all the rest was formless cloud and vacant depth; and it shuddered at the thought of tottering, and plunging amid that chaos. While pondering this new idea, I heard the front door open; Mr. Bates came out, and with him was a nurse. After she had seen him mount his horse and depart, she was about to close the door, but I ran up to her.\n“How is Helen Burns?”\n“Very poorly,” was the answer.\n“Is it her Mr. Bates has been to see?”\n“Yes.”\n“And what does he say about her?”\n“He says she’ll not be here long.”\nThis phrase, uttered in my hearing yesterday, would have only conveyed the notion that she was about to be removed to Northumberland, to her own home. I should not have suspected that it meant she was dying; but I knew instantly now! It opened clear on my comprehension that Helen Burns was numbering her last days in this world, and that she was going to be taken to the region of spirits, if such region there were. I experienced a shock of horror, then a strong thrill of grief, then a desire—a necessity to see her; and I asked in what room she lay.\n“She is in Miss Temple’s room,” said the nurse.\n“May I go up and speak to her?”\n“Oh no, child! It is not likely; and now it is time for you to come in; you’ll catch the fever if you stop out when the dew is falling.”\nThe nurse closed the front door; I went in by the side entrance which led to the schoolroom: I was just in time; it was nine o’clock, and Miss Miller was calling the pupils to go to bed.",

As was our habit, we had separated from the rest and wandered quite far, so much so that we became disoriented and had to seek directions from a solitary cottage inhabited by a couple who tended a herd of semi-wild pigs foraging in the woods. By the time we returned, the moon had risen. A pony, identifiable as the surgeon's, was waiting by the garden gate. Mary Ann commented that someone must be seriously ill for Mr. Bates to be summoned at that hour. She went inside, but I paused for a few minutes to plant some roots I had gathered in the woods, fearing they would wilt if left until morning. After planting them, I lingered longer, enchanted by the sweet scent of the flowers in the falling dew and the pleasant, calm warmth of the evening. The sky in the west still glowed, promising another beautiful day, while the moon ascended majestically in the serene east. As I observed and enjoyed these simple pleasures like a child, a thought struck me with unprecedented force: 'How terrible it would be to be confined to a sickbed now, facing death! This world is lovely; it would be awful to be taken away from it, to go to an unknown place.' At that moment, my mind struggled for the first time to grasp the religious concepts of heaven and hell it had been taught. It faltered, bewildered, and looking around mentally, it perceived an immeasurable void everywhere except for the single solid point of the present. Everything else was shapeless uncertainty and empty space, and the prospect of stumbling and falling into that chaos filled me with dread. While contemplating this unsettling thought, I heard the front door open. Mr. Bates emerged accompanied by a nurse. After watching him mount his horse and ride off, the nurse started to close the door, but I rushed up to her. 'How is Helen Burns?' I asked. 'Very poorly,' she replied. 'Has Mr. Bates been here to see her?' I inquired. 'Yes,' she confirmed. 'And what does he say about her condition?' 'He says she won't be here much longer.' Hearing this phrase just yesterday would have merely suggested she was being moved to Northumberland, to her family home. I wouldn't have suspected it meant she was dying. But now, I understood instantly! It became horrifyingly clear to me that Helen Burns was nearing the end of her life on earth and was bound for the spiritual realm, if such a place existed. I felt a surge of horror, followed by intense sorrow, and then a strong urge—a compelling need—to see her. I asked which room she was in. 'She is in Miss Temple's room,' the nurse said. 'May I go up and speak to her?' I asked. 'Oh no, child! That's not possible. And it's time for you to come in now; you'll catch the fever if you stay out in the falling dew.' The nurse closed the front door. I went in through the side entrance leading to the schoolroom. I arrived just in time; it was nine o'clock, and Miss Miller was calling the students to go to bed.",

As usual, we strayed from the rest of the group and wandered so far that we became lost, eventually having to ask directions at a small, isolated cottage where a couple cared for a herd of half-wild pigs feeding in the woods. By the time we returned, the moon had already risen, and we noticed the surgeon's pony at the garden door. Mary Ann guessed that someone must be quite ill since Mr. Bates had come so late. She went inside, but I stayed a bit longer to plant some roots I'd collected, worrying they might die if left till morning. Once finished, I tarried, enjoying the sweet fragrance of the flowers in the dewy, warm evening, admiring the serene twilight and majestic moonrise, and hoping for another beautiful day tomorrow. Absorbed in these moments, a sudden thought struck me: how sad it must be to lie sick and dying on such a lovely night, having to leave this pleasant world for the unknown. For the first time, I seriously tried to understand what I'd been told about heaven and hell, but my mind recoiled, feeling overwhelmed by the uncertainty and mystery, fearing the idea of leaving the present for the unfathomable unknown. As I pondered these thoughts, I heard the front door open. Mr. Bates and a nurse stepped outside. After seeing him off, the nurse was going to close the door when I hurried up to her to ask about Helen Burns. She told me Helen was very ill and that Mr. Bates didn’t think she had much time left. This shocked me; now I understood clearly that Helen was dying and would soon leave this world—if such a place as the spirit world existed. I was overcome by grief and the urge to see her, so I asked which room Helen was in. The nurse told me she was with Miss Temple, but wouldn’t let me go see her, reminding me it was time to come in or I’d catch the fever from the damp night air. The nurse shut the front door, so I entered through the side that led to the schoolroom, making it just in time as Miss Miller was calling us all to bed at nine o’clock."

It was quite at the other end of the house; but I knew my way; and the light of the unclouded summer moon, entering here and there at passage windows, enabled me to find it without difficulty. An odour of camphor and burnt vinegar warned me when I came near the fever room: and I passed its door quickly, fearful lest the nurse who sat up all night should hear me. I dreaded being discovered and sent back; for I must see Helen,—I must embrace her before she died,—I must give her one last kiss, exchange with her one last word.\nHaving descended a staircase, traversed a portion of the house below, and succeeded in opening and shutting, without noise, two doors, I reached another flight of steps; these I mounted, and then just opposite to me was Miss Temple’s room. A light shone through the keyhole and from under the door; a profound stillness pervaded the vicinity. Coming near, I found the door slightly ajar; probably to admit some fresh air into the close abode of sickness. Indisposed to hesitate, and full of impatient impulses—soul and senses quivering with keen throes—I put it back and looked in. My eye sought Helen, and feared to find death.\nClose by Miss Temple’s bed, and half covered with its white curtains, there stood a little crib. I saw the outline of a form under the clothes, but the face was hid by the hangings: the nurse I had spoken to in the garden sat in an easy-chair asleep; an unsnuffed candle burnt dimly on the table. Miss Temple was not to be seen: I knew afterwards that she had been called to a delirious patient in the fever-room. I advanced; then paused by the crib side: my hand was on the curtain, but I preferred speaking before I withdrew it.

It was located at the opposite end of the building, but I knew the way. The clear summer moon's light shining through various passage windows helped me find it easily. As I neared the area with the fever patients, a smell of camphor and burnt vinegar alerted me, and I quickly hurried past its door, worried the night nurse might hear me. I was terrified of being caught and sent back, because seeing Helen was imperative—I had to hug her one last time before she passed away, give her a final kiss, and share one last conversation. I went down one set of stairs, crossed a section of the lower floor, managed to open and close two doors quietly, and then reached another flight of steps. After climbing these, Miss Temple's room was directly in front of me. Light showed through the keyhole and from under the door, and the area was profoundly still. Approaching, I found the door slightly open, likely to let fresh air into the stuffy sickroom. Without hesitation, driven by urgent impulses and with my soul and senses intensely stirred, I pushed the door further open and looked inside. My eyes searched for Helen, dreading to find her dead. Next to Miss Temple's bed, partially hidden by its white curtains, was a small cot. I could see the shape of a body under the covers, but the face was concealed by the fabric. The nurse I had spoken to earlier in the garden was asleep in an armchair, and a dim, untrimmed candle burned on the table. Miss Temple wasn't there; I later learned she had been called to attend to a delirious patient in the fever room. I moved closer, then paused beside the cot. My hand was on the curtain, but I chose to speak before pulling it back, still hesitant to face the possibility of seeing a corpse. \"Helen!\" I whispered softly, \"Are you awake?\" She stirred, pulled back the curtain, and I saw her face, which was pale and thin but completely calm.

It is past eleven o’clock: I heard it strike some minutes since.”\n“I came to see you, Helen: I heard you were very ill, and I could not sleep till I had spoken to you.”\n“You came to bid me good-bye, then: you are just in time probably.”\n“Are you going somewhere, Helen? Are you going home?”\n“Yes; to my long home—my last home.”\n“No, no, Helen!” I stopped, distressed. While I tried to devour my tears, a fit of coughing seized Helen; it did not, however, wake the nurse; when it was over, she lay some minutes exhausted; then she whispered—\n“Jane, your little feet are bare; lie down and cover yourself with my quilt.”\nI did so: she put her arm over me, and I nestled close to her. After a long silence, she resumed, still whispering—\n“I am very happy, Jane; and when you hear that I am dead, you must be sure and not grieve: there is nothing to grieve about. We all must die one day, and the illness which is removing me is not painful; it is gentle and gradual: my mind is at rest. I leave no one to regret me much: I have only a father; and he is lately married, and will not miss me. By dying young, I shall escape great sufferings. I had not qualities or talents to make my way very well in the world: I should have been continually at fault.”\n“But where are you going to, Helen? Can you see? Do you know?”\n“I believe; I have faith: I am going to God.”\n“Where is God? What is God?”\n“My Maker and yours, who will never destroy what He created. I rely implicitly on His power, and confide wholly in His goodness: I count the hours till that eventful one arrives which shall restore me to Him, reveal Him to me.”\n“You are sure, then, Helen, that there is such a place as heaven, and that our souls can get to it when we die?”\n“I am sure there is a future state; I believe God is good; I can resign my immortal part to Him without any misgiving. God is my father; God is my friend: I love Him; I believe He loves me.”\n“And shall I see you again, Helen, when I die?”\n“You will come to the same region of happiness: be received by the same mighty, universal Parent, no doubt, dear Jane.”\nAgain I questioned, but this time only in thought. “Where is that region? Does it exist?” And I clasped my arms closer round Helen; she seemed dearer to me than ever; I felt as if I could not let her go; I lay with my face hidden on her neck. Presently she said, in the sweetest tone—\n“How comfortable I am! That last fit of coughing has tired me a little; I feel as if I could sleep: but don’t leave me, Jane; I like to have you near me.”\n“I’ll stay with you, dear Helen: no one shall take me away.”\n“Are you warm, darling?”\n“Yes.”\n“Good-night, Jane.”\n“Good-night, Helen.”\nShe kissed me, and I her, and we both soon slumbered.",

She couldn't speak and appear so composed if she were.\" I climbed onto her bed frame and kissed her. Her forehead was cold, as were her thin cheek, hand, and wrist; yet, she smiled just as she always had. \"Why are you here, Jane? It's after eleven; I heard the clock strike some minutes ago.\" \"I came to see you, Helen. I heard you were seriously ill, and I couldn't fall asleep until I had spoken to you.\" \"You came to say farewell, then; you've likely arrived just in time.\" \"Are you going somewhere, Helen? Are you heading home?\" \"Yes, to my final home—my permanent residence.\" \"No, no, Helen!\" I stopped, upset. As I struggled to hold back tears, Helen was seized by a coughing fit, but it didn't awaken the nurse. When it subsided, she lay exhausted for a few minutes before whispering, \"Jane, your small feet are uncovered; lie down and share my blanket.\" I did as she asked. She wrapped her arm around me, and I snuggled close to her. After a prolonged silence, she resumed, still speaking quietly, \"I am very content, Jane, and when you learn of my death, you must not grieve. There's nothing to be sad about. We will all die eventually, and this sickness that is taking me isn't painful; it's gentle and gradual. My mind is at ease. I leave no one who will mourn me deeply; I only have a father, and he has recently remarried and won't miss me. By dying young, I will avoid significant hardships. I lacked the qualities or talents to navigate the world successfully; I would have consistently made mistakes.\" \"But where are you heading, Helen? Can you see? Do you know?\" \"I believe; I have faith. I am going to God.\" \"Where is God? What is God?\" \"My Creator and yours, who will never destroy what He made. I trust completely in His strength and confide entirely in His goodness. I count the minutes until that significant hour arrives that will bring me back to Him, revealing Him to me.\" \"You are certain, then, Helen, that heaven exists and that our souls can reach it when we die?\" \"I am certain there is a life after death. I believe God is good. I can entrust my eternal self to Him without any doubt. God is my father; God is my friend. I love Him; I believe He loves me.\" \"And will I see you again, Helen, when I die?\" \"You will come to the same joyful place and undoubtedly be welcomed by the same powerful, universal Parent, dear Jane.\" I questioned again, though this time only in my thoughts, \"Where is that place? Does it truly exist?\" And I tightened my embrace around Helen. She felt dearer to me than ever; I felt as though I couldn't let her go. I lay with my face buried against her neck. Presently, in the tenderest tone, she murmured, \"How comfortable I feel! That last coughing spell tired me a bit; I feel I could sleep. But don't leave me, Jane; I like having you close.\" \"I will stay with you, my dear Helen; no one will take me away.\" \"Are you warm, beloved?\" \"Yes.\" \"Goodnight, Jane.\" \"Goodnight, Helen.\" She kissed me, and I kissed her back, and soon we were both asleep.",

I was relieved, thinking she couldn't be dying if she could speak and look so calmly. I climbed onto her bed and kissed her, noticing how cold and thin she felt, yet she still smiled as kindly as always. Helen wondered why I had come so late, saying it was after eleven, and I explained I had heard of her illness and couldn't rest until I had spoken with her. She said I must have come to say goodbye, and that I had just made it in time. I anxiously asked if she was leaving, and if she meant she was going 'home.' Helen clarified she meant her final home. Troubled, I protested, but as I struggled not to cry, Helen had a coughing fit, which thankfully did not wake the nurse. Afterwards, exhausted, she told me to cover my bare feet and lie beside her. I did so, and she put her arm around me. After a silent pause, Helen told me she was content, and urged me not to grieve when she was gone, as her passing would be peaceful and painless, and she believed her father would not miss her much. Dying young meant she avoided greater suffering, and she doubted she would have thrived in life. When I asked where she was going, and if she knew what awaited her, Helen reassured me she had faith she was going to God, her creator, who would not abandon her. She trusted in His goodness, looking forward to being reunited with Him. She was certain of an afterlife, and content to leave her soul in God's care, believing Him to be her loving father and friend. I asked if I would see her again after death, and she assured me I would join her in the same happiness and be welcomed by God too. Silently, I wondered where such a place might be, desperately hugging Helen, not wanting to let her go. Helen remarked how comfortable she felt, though tired after her cough, and asked me not to leave her side, which I promised. She checked if I was warm, and when I said yes, she wished me goodnight, and I did the same. We kissed, and soon both fell asleep together."

But this is not to be a regular autobiography: I am only bound to invoke Memory where I know her responses will possess some degree of interest; therefore I now pass a space of eight years almost in silence: a few lines only are necessary to keep up the links of connection.\nWhen the typhus fever had fulfilled its mission of devastation at Lowood, it gradually disappeared from thence; but not till its virulence and the number of its victims had drawn public attention on the school. Inquiry was made into the origin of the scourge, and by degrees various facts came out which excited public indignation in a high degree. The unhealthy nature of the site; the quantity and quality of the children’s food; the brackish, fetid water used in its preparation; the pupils’ wretched clothing and accommodations—all these things were discovered, and the discovery produced a result mortifying to Mr. Brocklehurst, but beneficial to the institution.\nSeveral wealthy and benevolent individuals in the county subscribed largely for the erection of a more convenient building in a better situation; new regulations were made; improvements in diet and clothing introduced; the funds of the school were intrusted to the management of a committee. Mr. Brocklehurst, who, from his wealth and family connections, could not be overlooked, still retained the post of treasurer; but he was aided in the discharge of his duties by gentlemen of rather more enlarged and sympathising minds: his office of inspector, too, was shared by those who knew how to combine reason with strictness, comfort with economy, compassion with uprightness. The school, thus improved, became in time a truly useful and noble institution. I remained an inmate of its walls, after its regeneration, for eight years: six as pupil, and two as teacher; and in both capacities I bear my testimony to its value and importance.\nDuring these eight years my life was uniform: but not unhappy, because it was not inactive. I had the means of an excellent education placed within my reach; a fondness for some of my studies, and a desire to excel in all, together with a great delight in pleasing my teachers, especially such as I loved, urged me on: I availed myself fully of the advantages offered me. In time I rose to be the first girl of the first class; then I was invested with the office of teacher; which I discharged with zeal for two years: but at the end of that time I altered.",

Therefore, I will now pass quickly over a period of eight years, mentioning it almost in silence. Just a few sentences are needed to maintain the narrative thread.",

However, this is not intended to be a traditional autobiography; I will only recount memories that seem likely to interest the reader. Therefore, I will largely skip over the next eight years of my life, mentioning only the essentials to maintain continuity. After the typhus outbreak had wreaked havoc at Lowood School, it eventually subsided, but only after its severity and high number of victims attracted public scrutiny to the institution. Investigations were conducted into why the illness had spread, and information came to light that caused public outrage—the unhealthy location of the school, the poor quality and quantity of food, contaminated water, and inadequate clothing and living conditions were all revealed. This exposure, though humiliating for Mr. Brocklehurst, led to improvements for the school. Several wealthy and charitable local people donated generously to build better facilities in a healthier setting; new rules were established, and improvements were made to food and clothing. Control of the school's finances was placed in the hands of a committee. Mr. Brocklehurst, due to his wealth and social standing, remained as treasurer, but was joined in his responsibilities by men who were more broad-minded and compassionate, and his inspector role was also shared by those who combined fairness and kindness with discipline. Thanks to these reforms, the school became a respected and valuable institution over time. I stayed there after these changes for eight years—six as a student and two as a teacher—and I can vouch for its worth and significance in both roles. My life during that period was routine, but not unhappy, as it was filled with purpose. I had access to an excellent education, enjoyed many of my studies, wanted to excel, and found pleasure in pleasing my teachers, particularly those I cared for, which motivated me. I made the most of these opportunities, eventually becoming the top student, then spending two years as a teacher, performing my duties enthusiastically. But after those two years, things changed for me."

At this period she married, removed with her husband (a clergyman, an excellent man, almost worthy of such a wife) to a distant county, and consequently was lost to me.\nFrom the day she left I was no longer the same: with her was gone every settled feeling, every association that had made Lowood in some degree a home to me. I had imbibed from her something of her nature and much of her habits: more harmonious thoughts: what seemed better regulated feelings had become the inmates of my mind. I had given in allegiance to duty and order; I was quiet; I believed I was content: to the eyes of others, usually even to my own, I appeared a disciplined and subdued character.\nBut destiny, in the shape of the Rev. Mr. Nasmyth, came between me and Miss Temple: I saw her in her travelling dress step into a post-chaise, shortly after the marriage ceremony; I watched the chaise mount the hill and disappear beyond its brow; and then retired to my own room, and there spent in solitude the greatest part of the half-holiday granted in honour of the occasion.\nI walked about the chamber most of the time. I imagined myself only to be regretting my loss, and thinking how to repair it; but when my reflections were concluded, and I looked up and found that the afternoon was gone, and evening far advanced, another discovery dawned on me, namely, that in the interval I had undergone a transforming process; that my mind had put off all it had borrowed of Miss Temple—or rather that she had taken with her the serene atmosphere I had been breathing in her vicinity—and that now I was left in my natural element, and beginning to feel the stirring of old emotions. It did not seem as if a prop were withdrawn, but rather as if a motive were gone: it was not the power to be tranquil which had failed me, but the reason for tranquillity was no more. My world had for some years been in Lowood: my experience had been of its rules and systems; now I remembered that the real world was wide, and that a varied field of hopes and fears, of sensations and excitements, awaited those who had courage to go forth into its expanse, to seek real knowledge of life amidst its perils.\nI went to my window, opened it, and looked out. There were the two wings of the building; there was the garden; there were the skirts of Lowood; there was the hilly horizon. My eye passed all other objects to rest on those most remote, the blue peaks; it was those I longed to surmount; all within their boundary of rock and heath seemed prison-ground, exile limits. I traced the white road winding round the base of one mountain, and vanishing in a gorge between two; how I longed to follow it farther! I recalled the time when I had travelled that very road in a coach; I remembered descending that hill at twilight; an age seemed to have elapsed since the day which brought me first to Lowood, and I had never quitted it since. My vacations had all been spent at school: Mrs. Reed had never sent for me to Gateshead; neither she nor any of her family had ever been to visit me. I had had no communication by letter or message with the outer world: school-rules, school-duties, school-habits and notions, and voices, and faces, and phrases, and costumes, and preferences, and antipathies—such was what I knew of existence. And now I felt that it was not enough; I tired of the routine of eight years in one afternoon. I desired liberty; for liberty I gasped; for liberty I uttered a prayer; it seemed scattered on the wind then faintly blowing. I abandoned it and framed a humbler supplication; for change, stimulus: that petition, too, seemed swept off into vague space: “Then,” I cried, half desperate, “grant me at least a new servitude!”",
          "paraphrase_gemini-2.5-flash-preview-04-17": "Miss Temple consistently held the role of headmistress at the school throughout all the changes. I credited her teaching with the most significant part of my education; her friendship and company provided constant comfort. She served as a mother, teacher, and later, a friend to me. Around this time, she married and moved with her husband (a clergyman, an excellent man, almost worthy of such a wife) to a faraway county, resulting in her absence from my life.\nFrom the moment she left, I was fundamentally changed. With her went every stable feeling, every connection that had made Lowood feel somewhat like a home. I had absorbed some of her character and many of her habits from her: my thoughts became more harmonious, and my feelings seemed better regulated, becoming part of my inner self. I had committed to duty and order; I was quiet; I believed I was content. To others, and usually even to myself, I appeared disciplined and compliant.\nHowever, fate, in the form of the Reverend Mr. Nasmyth, separated Miss Temple and me. I watched her, dressed for travel, get into a carriage soon after the wedding. I saw the carriage climb the hill and disappear over the top, then I went back to my room and spent most of the half-holiday, given in celebration of the wedding, alone there.\nI spent most of the time walking around the room. I thought I was just regretting my loss and figuring out how to cope. But when I finished thinking and saw that the afternoon was over and evening was well underway, I had another realization: that during that time, I had undergone a transformation. My mind had shed everything it had adopted from Miss Temple—or rather, she had taken with her the calm atmosphere I had been breathing while near her. Now, I was left in my natural state and started feeling the stirring of old emotions again. It didn't feel like a support had been removed, but more like the purpose had vanished. It wasn't that I could no longer be calm, but that there was no longer a reason to be calm. For several years, my world had been confined to Lowood; my experience was limited to its rules and routines. Now, I remembered that the real world was vast, and that a diverse landscape of hopes and fears, sensations and excitements, awaited those brave enough to venture into it and seek true understanding of life amidst its dangers.\nI went to my window, opened it, and looked out. There were the two sections of the building, the garden, the edge of the Lowood grounds, and the distant hills. My gaze moved past everything else to settle on the furthest points, the blue peaks. Those were what I yearned to cross. Everything within their boundary of rock and moor seemed like prison territory, limits of exile. I followed the white road winding around the base of one mountain and disappearing into a valley between two others. How I longed to follow it further! I remembered the time I had traveled that very road in a carriage. I recalled coming down that hill at dusk. It felt like an age had passed since the day I first arrived at Lowood, and I had not left since. All my school breaks had been spent at the school; Mrs. Reed had never sent for me to Gateshead, nor had she or any of her family ever visited me. I had had no communication by letter or message with the outside world. School rules, school duties, school habits and ideas, voices, faces, phrases, clothes, preferences, and dislikes—this was the extent of my knowledge of existence. And now I felt it wasn't enough. I grew weary of eight years of routine in a single afternoon. I craved freedom; I gasped for freedom; I offered a prayer for freedom; it seemed scattered on the faint wind blowing. I abandoned that hope and formed a more modest plea: for change, for stimulation. That request, too, seemed swept away into empty space. 'Then,' I cried, half-desperate, 'grant me at least a new form of servitude!'",
          "paraphrase_gpt-4.1-2025-04-14": "Up to this point, Miss Temple had stayed on as head of the school regardless of any changes, and I owed most of my knowledge to her teaching. Her companionship and kindness were a constant comfort to me; she filled the roles of mother, teacher, and, more recently, friend. At this time, though, she got married and moved far away with her husband, a clergyman who was nearly deserving of her, and as a result I lost her from my life.\n\nAfter she left, I changed; all the feelings and connections that made Lowood feel a bit like home disappeared with her. I had absorbed some of her temperament and many of her habits: my thoughts were more peaceful, my feelings more balanced. I had embraced duty and order, was quiet, and believed myself content. To others and mostly to myself, I seemed calm and well-controlled.\n\nBut fate intervened with the arrival of the Rev. Mr. Nasmyth, and I watched Miss Temple in her travel clothes leave in a carriage soon after she married. I observed the coach disappear over a hill, then went to my room and spent most of the special half-holiday given that day alone.\n\nI paced the room and at first thought I was only mourning the loss and trying to figure out how to cope. But as the afternoon faded into evening, I realized I had changed: everything I had taken from Miss Temple seemed to vanish, or rather, she had left and taken with her the calm atmosphere I’d thrived in. I felt like I was returning to my true self, and old feelings began to stir. It didn’t feel as if I lost a support, but rather my reason for being composed was gone. For years, my world had been limited to Lowood and its regulations. Now I remembered the broader world outside and realized so much more—hope, fear, sensations, excitement—awaited those brave enough to seek real life experience beyond school walls.\n\nI opened my window and looked out: the school buildings, the garden, the edges of Lowood, and far in the distance, the blue hills. My gaze lingered most on those distant peaks; I ached to climb beyond them. Everything within Lowood’s boundaries now felt confining. I traced the winding road along the mountain and wished to follow it further. I recalled travelling that road before, arriving at Lowood years ago, and realized I hadn’t left since—my holidays were all spent at school, Mrs. Reed never called me back nor visited. There was no contact with the outside world; my life consisted only of school routines, rules, faces, conversation, tastes, and dislikes. That was my whole existence. But it no longer satisfied me; eight years of monotony became unbearable in one afternoon. I craved freedom—I even prayed for it, but it felt like my plea was lost on the breeze. So, I asked instead for change or excitement, but that request too seemed to dissolve. Desperately I pleaded, if not liberty, then at least let me serve somewhere new."

          "text_segment": "Here a bell, ringing the hour of supper, called me downstairs.\nI was not free to resume the interrupted chain of my reflections till bedtime: even then a teacher who occupied the same room with me kept me from the subject to which I longed to recur, by a prolonged effusion of small talk. How I wished sleep would silence her. It seemed as if, could I but go back to the idea which had last entered my mind as I stood at the window, some inventive suggestion would rise for my relief.\nMiss Gryce snored at last; she was a heavy Welshwoman, and till now her habitual nasal strains had never been regarded by me in any other light than as a nuisance; to-night I hailed the first deep notes with satisfaction; I was debarrassed of interruption; my half-effaced thought instantly revived.\n“A new servitude! There is something in that,” I soliloquised (mentally, be it understood; I did not talk aloud). “I know there is, because it does not sound too sweet; it is not like such words as Liberty, Excitement, Enjoyment: delightful sounds truly; but no more than sounds for me; and so hollow and fleeting that it is mere waste of time to listen to them. But Servitude! That must be matter of fact. Any one may serve: I have served here eight years; now all I want is to serve elsewhere. Can I not get so much of my own will? Is not the thing feasible? Yes—yes—the end is not so difficult; if I had only a brain active enough to ferret out the means of attaining it.”\nI sat up in bed by way of arousing this said brain: it was a chilly night; I covered my shoulders with a shawl, and then I proceeded to think again with all my might.\n“What do I want? A new place, in a new house, amongst new faces, under new circumstances: I want this because it is of no use wanting anything better. How do people do to get a new place? They apply to friends, I suppose: I have no friends. There are many others who have no friends, who must look about for themselves and be their own helpers; and what is their resource?”\nI could not tell: nothing answered me; I then ordered my brain to find a response, and quickly. It worked and worked faster: I felt the pulses throb in my head and temples; but for nearly an hour it worked in chaos; and no result came of its efforts. Feverish with vain labour, I got up and took a turn in the room; undrew the curtain, noted a star or two, shivered with cold, and again crept to bed.\nA kind fairy, in my absence, had surely dropped the required suggestion on my pillow; for as I lay down, it came quietly and naturally to my mind:—“Those who want situations advertise; you must advertise in the ——shire Herald.”\n“How? I know nothing about advertising.”\nReplies rose smooth and prompt now:—\n“You must enclose the advertisement and the money to pay for it under a cover directed to the editor of the Herald; you must put it, the first opportunity you have, into the post at Lowton; answers must be addressed to J.E., at the post-office there; you can go and inquire in about a week after you send your letter, if any are come, and act accordingly.”\nThis scheme I went over twice, thrice; it was then digested in my mind; I had it in a clear practical form: I felt satisfied, and fell asleep.",
          "paraphrase_gemini-2.5-flash-preview-04-17": "A bell signaling supper called me downstairs, interrupting my reflections until it was time for bed. Even then, the teacher sharing my room prevented me from returning to my thoughts with her continuous chatter. I desperately wished she would fall asleep, feeling that if I could just revisit the idea I had while standing at the window, a creative solution might present itself. Finally, Miss Gryce, a large Welsh woman whose regular snoring had always been a nuisance, began to snore. Tonight, I welcomed her deep, habitual noises with relief; I was finally free from interruption, and my half-faded thought immediately returned. \"A new position! There is something real in that,\" I reflected silently. \"I know it's real because it doesn't sound overly pleasant; it's not like words such as Liberty, Excitement, or Enjoyment, which sound delightful but are just sounds to me—so empty and fleeting that listening to them is a waste of time. But Servitude! That must be a tangible reality. Anyone can serve; I've served here for eight years. Now all I desire is to serve somewhere else. Can I not achieve this much of my own will? Is the idea not possible? Yes, yes—the outcome isn't the main difficulty; the challenge is just having a mind sharp enough to uncover the means of achieving it.\" I sat up in bed to try and stimulate this brain of mine. It was a cold night, so I wrapped a shawl around my shoulders and resumed thinking as hard as I could. \"What is it I want?\" I asked myself. \"A different situation, in a different setting, among different people, under different circumstances. I want this because desiring anything better is pointless. How do people manage to find new positions? They probably ask friends, I suppose; I have no friends. There are many others without friends who must find opportunities for themselves and be their own help; what is their resource?\" I couldn't answer; nothing came to mind. I then ordered my brain to find a quick answer. It worked faster and faster; I could feel the pulses throbbing in my head and temples, but for nearly an hour, my thoughts were chaotic, producing no result. Agitated from the futile effort, I got out of bed, took a short walk around the room, pulled back the curtain, noted a couple of stars, shivered from the cold, and then got back into bed. Surely, while I was up, a kind fairy must have placed the needed suggestion on my pillow, for as I lay down, it came to me calmly and naturally: \"Those who are looking for employment advertise; you must place an advertisement in the --shire Herald.\" \"How?\" I wondered, \"I know nothing about advertising.\" Answers came smoothly and promptly now: \"You must place the advertisement and the necessary payment in an envelope addressed to the editor of the Herald. Post it at Lowton at the first opportunity you have. Replies should be directed to J.E. at the post office there. You can go and inquire there about a week after you send your letter to see if any have arrived, and proceed accordingly.\" I reviewed this plan two or three times; it was now clear and organized in my mind, taking a practical form. Feeling content, I drifted off to sleep.",
          "paraphrase_gpt-4.1-2025-04-14": "At that moment, the bell signaling supper rang, so I had to go downstairs. I couldn't pick up my interrupted thoughts until bedtime, but even then, the teacher who shared my room distracted me with endless chatter, making it impossible for me to focus on what I really wanted to think about. I just wished she would fall asleep so I could have some peace. I felt that if only I could return to the idea that last entered my mind by the window, maybe I'd come up with a good idea to help myself. Eventually, Miss Gryce, my heavyset Welsh roommate, began to snore. Ordinarily, I found her snoring annoying, but tonight it was welcomed because it meant she wouldn’t interrupt me anymore, and immediately my half-formed thought returned.  \n\n“A new kind of work! There's something about that,” I thought to myself. “It doesn’t sound pleasant like ‘freedom’ or ‘excitement’ or ‘enjoyment’—those are just attractive words to me, with no real substance. But ‘servitude’ is practical and real. Anyone can serve; I’ve been serving here for eight years. All I want is to serve in a different place. Can’t I get that much control over my life? Isn’t it possible? Yes—if only I can figure out a way to achieve it.”\n\nTrying to stimulate my thinking, I sat up in bed, wrapped a shawl around my shoulders because it was cold, and concentrated hard. “What do I want? A new job, in a different household, among unfamiliar people, in a new situation—because there’s no point in hoping for something better than that. How do people get new positions? I suppose they ask friends. But I don’t have any friends. Many people are in the same boat; they have to rely on themselves, so what do they do?”\n\nI had no answers. I demanded my mind to find a solution quickly, but though my thoughts raced and pounded away, for almost an hour I came up with nothing. Frustrated and restless, I got up, paced my room, looked at the stars from the window, shivered in the cold, then went back to bed. \n\nBy some stroke of good luck, as soon as I lay down, the answer appeared in my mind: “People who want jobs place advertisements; you should advertise in the ——shire Herald.”\n\n“But how? I know nothing about putting in ads.”\n\nNow, answers came to me clearly: “You must write your advertisement, include the payment, and send it all to the editor of the Herald. Put it in the post at Lowton as soon as you can. Ask that replies be addressed to J.E., at the post office there; check back about a week later and see if you have any responses.”\n\nI went over this plan several times until I had it memorized and understood.

It read as follows: \"A young woman with experience teaching\" (I had taught for two years) \"is seeking a position with a private family. The children should be under fourteen\" (I felt that at barely eighteen, I shouldn't teach students close to my own age). \"She is capable of instructing in the standard subjects of a good English education, plus French, Drawing, and Music\" (at that time, dear reader, this list of skills, which seems limited now, was considered quite extensive). \"Please reply to J.E., Post-office, Lowton, --shire.\" I kept this paper hidden in my drawer all day. After dinner, I requested permission from the new supervisor to go to Lowton to run a few errands for myself and some other teachers; permission was quickly granted. I went. It was a two-mile walk, and the evening was damp, but the days were still long. I stopped at a couple of stores, dropped the letter in the post office, and returned through heavy rain, my clothes soaked, but my heart felt lighter. The next week felt slow, but eventually, like everything else in the world, it ended. Once again, as a lovely autumn day neared its close, I found myself walking towards Lowton. The path itself was quite scenic, following the stream and winding through the beautiful valley curves. However, that day I was more preoccupied with the possibility of letters waiting for me in the small town than with the beauty of the fields and water. My official reason for this trip was to get fitted for new shoes. So, I completed that task first. Once finished, I crossed the clean, quiet little street from the shoemaker's to the post office. It was run by an elderly woman who wore horn-rimmed glasses on her nose and black gloves on her hands. \"Are there any letters for J.E.?\" I inquired. She peered at me over her glasses, then opened a drawer and rummaged through its contents for a considerable time, so long that my hope began to fade. Finally, after holding a document up to her glasses for nearly five minutes, she handed it across the counter, giving me another questioning and suspicious look. It was addressed to J.E. \"Is this the only one?\" I asked. \"There are no others,\" she replied. I placed it in my pocket and started heading back.

My ad stated: 'A young lady with experience in teaching' (after all, I’d taught for two years) 'seeks a position in a private household, caring for children under fourteen' (since I was not yet eighteen, teaching children close to my own age wouldn’t be ideal). 'She can instruct in the standard English subjects, as well as French, Drawing, and Music' (at that time, this would have been considered a well-rounded education). 'Replies to J.E., Post-office, Lowton, ——shire.' I kept this advert locked in my drawer all day. After dinner, I asked the new head of the school for permission to go to Lowton to run a few errands for myself and some colleagues; she agreed, and I set out. It was a two-mile journey on a rainy evening, but since the days were long, I managed to visit a couple of shops, mail my letter, and return in the downpour—soaked, but feeling relieved. The following week dragged on, but eventually ended as all things do, and again, on a pleasant autumn evening, I found myself walking to Lowton. The route was scenic, running beside a stream and through the most beautiful parts of the valley; still, my thoughts were preoccupied with wondering if any replies awaited me at the small town post office, rather than admiring the scenery. My main reason for this trip was to have my feet measured for new shoes, which I took care of first. Afterward, I crossed the tidy, peaceful street from the cobbler’s to the post office, run by an elderly woman with horn-rimmed glasses and black gloves. 'Any letters for J.E.?' I asked. She peered at me, rummaged through a drawer for an uncomfortably long time, making my hopes waver, but finally, after examining an envelope for several minutes, she handed it to me with a questioning look—it was indeed for J.E. 'Is that all?' I asked. 'No more,' she replied. I pocketed the letter and headed home; I didn’t open it yet, as the rules required me to return by eight, and it was already half-past seven."

Even when we finally retired for the night, the inevitable Miss Gryce was still my companion: we had only a short end of candle in our candlestick, and I dreaded lest she should talk till it was all burnt out; fortunately, however, the heavy supper she had eaten produced a soporific effect: she was already snoring before I had finished undressing. There still remained an inch of candle: I now took out my letter; the seal was an initial F.; I broke it; the contents were brief.\n“If J.E., who advertised in the ——shire Herald of last Thursday, possesses the acquirements mentioned, and if she is in a position to give satisfactory references as to character and competency, a situation can be offered her where there is but one pupil, a little girl, under ten years of age; and where the salary is thirty pounds per annum. J.E. is requested to send references, name, address, and all particulars to the direction:—\n“Mrs. Fairfax, Thornfield, near Millcote, ——shire.”\nI examined the document long: the writing was old-fashioned and rather uncertain, like that of an elderly lady. This circumstance was satisfactory: a private fear had haunted me, that in thus acting for myself, and by my own guidance, I ran the risk of getting into some scrape; and, above all things, I wished the result of my endeavours to be respectable, proper, en règle. I now felt that an elderly lady was no bad ingredient in the business I had on hand. Mrs. Fairfax! I saw her in a black gown and widow’s cap; frigid, perhaps, but not uncivil: a model of elderly English respectability. Thornfield! that, doubtless, was the name of her house: a neat orderly spot, I was sure; though I failed in my efforts to conceive a correct plan of the premises. Millcote, ——shire; I brushed up my recollections of the map of England; yes, I saw it; both the shire and the town. ——shire was seventy miles nearer London than the remote county where I now resided: that was a recommendation to me. I longed to go where there was life and movement: Millcote was a large manufacturing town on the banks of the A——: a busy place enough, doubtless: so much the better; it would be a complete change at least. Not that my fancy was much captivated by the idea of long chimneys and clouds of smoke—“but,” I argued, “Thornfield will, probably, be a good way from the town.”\nHere the socket of the candle dropped, and the wick went out.",

Afterwards, I ate supper with the other instructors. Even when we finally retired for the night, the ever-present Miss Gryce was still my roommate. We had only a small remnant of a candle left in our holder, and I worried she would talk until it was completely burned out. Fortunately, however, the heavy meal she had consumed made her sleepy, and she was already snoring before I had finished getting undressed. There was still about an inch of candle left, so I took out my letter. The seal had the initial 'F'. I broke it open; the contents were brief. It read: \"If J.E., who placed an advertisement in the ----shire Herald last Thursday, possesses the skills mentioned, and if she can provide satisfactory references regarding her character and ability, a position is available where there is only one pupil, a young girl under ten years of age, with a salary of thirty pounds per year. J.E. is asked to send references, her full name, address, and all details to the address: Mrs. Fairfax, Thornfield, near Millcote, ----shire.\" I examined the document carefully for a long time. The handwriting was old-fashioned and somewhat unsteady, like that of an elderly woman. This detail was reassuring. I had been privately anxious that by taking this step on my own initiative, I might risk getting into some trouble, and above all else, I wanted the outcome of my efforts to be respectable, proper, and correct. I now felt that having an elderly lady involved was a positive sign for the matter I was pursuing. Mrs. Fairfax! I pictured her in a black dress and widow’s cap, perhaps reserved but not rude – a perfect example of respectable elderly English womanhood. Thornfield! That was undoubtedly the name of her residence. I was sure it was a neat, orderly place, though I struggled to form a clear mental image of the property's layout. Millcote, ----shire; I refreshed my memory of the map of England. Yes, I remembered it – both the county and the town. ----shire was seventy miles closer to London than the distant county where I currently resided, which was a point in its favour for me. I longed to go somewhere with more activity and life. Millcote was a large industrial town located on the banks of the A----; no doubt a busy place, which was all the better – it would certainly be a complete change. Not that the idea of tall chimneys and clouds of smoke particularly appealed to me, but I reasoned, \"Thornfield will probably be located a good distance from the town.\" At this point, the base of the candle fell, and the flame went out.",

Even at bedtime, Miss Gryce was still with me in our room. We had only a small piece of candle left, and I was worried she might keep talking until it burned out. Luckily, the big meal she’d eaten made her sleepy, and she was already snoring before I finished getting ready for bed. That meant I still had a bit of candlelight left, so I took out the letter I had received. The seal bore the initial F, which I broke to read the brief contents. It said that if J.E., who had advertised in the newspaper, had the required qualifications and could provide satisfactory references, there was a position available as governess to a single young girl under ten, with a salary of thirty pounds a year. J.E. was asked to send her references and information to Mrs. Fairfax at Thornfield, near Millcote in ——shire. I examined the letter and noticed the handwriting was old-fashioned and somewhat shaky, as if written by an elderly lady. This reassured me, since I’d been worried that acting independently might lead to trouble and I wanted my actions to be respectable and proper. The mention of an elderly lady as my employer seemed promising. I imagined Mrs. Fairfax as a dignified older woman, probably wearing black and a widow’s cap—perhaps a bit severe but polite. Thornfield, presumably her home, sounded like a well-kept, orderly place, though I couldn’t picture it clearly. Millcote was a large industrial town on the river A——, bustling with activity, which appealed to me as it promised a significant change from my current, more remote location. The county was seventy miles nearer to London, another advantage. Though I wasn’t excited by the idea of factories and smoke, I reasoned that Thornfield was likely far enough from the town. Just then, the candle went out as the socket gave way."

Now the sisters constantly quarreled.",
            "Regarding John Reed, Bessie reported he was not doing well, having failed at college (been 'plucked') and, despite his uncles wanting him to study law, he was too dissipated for them to make much of him.",

            "Jane pointed to one of her watercolor landscapes over the chimney-piece, a gift to the superintendent who had framed it.",
            "Bessie admired the painting greatly, declaring it as fine as anything the Miss Reeds' drawing-master could produce, and far beyond the young ladies' own abilities. She then asked about French.",
            "Jane confirmed she could both read and speak French, and also work on muslin and canvas.",

She went up to London last winter with her mama, and there everybody admired her, and a young lord fell in love with her: but his relations were against the match; and—what do you think?—he and Miss Georgiana made it up to run away; but they were found out and stopped.

He went to college, and he got—plucked, I think they call it: and then his uncles wanted him to be a barrister, and study the law: but he is such a dissipated young man, they will never make much of him, I think.”\n“What does he look like?”\n“He is very tall: some people call him a fine-looking young man; but he has such thick lips.”\n“And Mrs. Reed?”\n“Missis looks stout and well enough in the face, but I think she’s not quite easy in her mind: Mr. John’s conduct does not please her—he spends a deal of money.”\n“Did she send you here, Bessie?”\n“No, indeed: but I have long wanted to see you, and when I heard that there had been a letter from you, and that you were going to another part of the country, I thought I’d just set off, and get a look at you before you were quite out of my reach.”\n“I am afraid you are disappointed in me, Bessie.” I said this laughing: I perceived that Bessie’s glance, though it expressed regard, did in no shape denote admiration.\n“No, Miss Jane, not exactly: you are genteel enough; you look like a lady, and it is as much as ever I expected of you: you were no beauty as a child.”\nI smiled at Bessie’s frank answer: I felt that it was correct, but I confess I was not quite indifferent to its import: at eighteen most people wish to please, and the conviction that they have not an exterior likely to second that desire brings anything but gratification.\n“I dare say you are clever, though,” continued Bessie, by way of solace. “What can you do? Can you play on the piano?”\n“A little.”\nThere was one in the room; Bessie went and opened it, and then asked me to sit down and give her a tune: I played a waltz or two, and she was charmed.\n“The Miss Reeds could not play as well!” said she exultingly. “I always said you would surpass them in learning: and can you draw?”\n“That is one of my paintings over the chimney-piece.” It was a landscape in water colours, of which I had made a present to the superintendent, in acknowledgment of her obliging mediation with the committee on my behalf, and which she had framed and glazed.\n“Well, that is beautiful, Miss Jane! It is as fine a picture as any Miss Reed’s drawing-master could paint, let alone the young ladies themselves, who could not come near it: and have you learnt French?”\n“Yes, Bessie, I can both read it and speak it.”\n“And you can work on muslin and canvas?”\n“I can.”\n“Oh, you are quite a lady, Miss Jane! I knew you would be: you will get on whether your relations notice you or not. There was something I wanted to ask you. Have you ever heard anything from your father’s kinsfolk, the Eyres?”\n“Never in my life.”\n“Well, you know Missis always said they were poor and quite despicable: and they may be poor; but I believe they are as much gentry as the Reeds are; for one day, nearly seven years ago, a Mr. Eyre came to Gateshead and wanted to see you; Missis said you were at school fifty miles off; he seemed so much disappointed, for he could not stay: he was going on a voyage to a foreign country, and the ship was to sail from London in a day or two. He looked quite a gentleman, and I believe he was your father’s brother.”\n“What foreign country was he going to, Bessie?”\n“An island thousands of miles off, where they make wine—the butler did tell me—”\n“Madeira?” I suggested.\n“Yes, that is it—that is the very word.”\n“So he went?”\n“Yes; he did not stay many minutes in the house: Missis was very high with him; she called him afterwards a ‘sneaking tradesman.’ My Robert believes he was a wine-merchant.”\n“Very likely,” I returned; “or perhaps clerk or agent to a wine-merchant.”",
          "paraphrase_gemini-2.5-flash-preview-04-17": "A servant encountered me in the hallway, where I was pacing restlessly, and informed me that someone downstairs wanted to see me. Assuming it was the carrier, I quickly headed down without asking any questions. As I passed the back-parlour, which also served as the teachers' lounge, with its door ajar, someone rushed out. “It’s definitely her! I’d know her anywhere!” exclaimed the person who halted my progress and took my hand. I looked closely and saw a woman dressed like a respectable servant, looking mature but still youthful, quite attractive with dark hair and eyes, and a vibrant complexion. She asked, in a voice and with a smile that were somewhat familiar, “Well, do you remember me, Miss Jane? I don’t think you’ve completely forgotten.” In an instant, I was hugging and kissing her with joy, repeating only, “Bessie! Bessie! Bessie!” She responded with a mix of laughter and tears, and we went into the parlour together. By the fireplace stood a little boy, about three years old, wearing a plaid outfit. Bessie immediately said, “That’s my son.” “So, you’re married, Bessie?” I asked. “Yes, almost five years now, to Robert Leaven, the coachman. And besides Bobby here, I have a little girl I named Jane.” “And you’re not living at Gateshead Hall anymore?” “I live in the lodge; the old gatekeeper is gone.” “Alright, how is everyone there? Tell me everything about them, Bessie, but please sit down first. And Bobby, won’t you come sit on my lap?” Bobby, however, preferred to stay close to his mother. “You haven’t grown much taller, Miss Jane, or wider,” Mrs. Leaven commented. “I expect they didn’t feed you particularly well at school. Miss Reed is much taller than you, and Miss Georgiana is twice your width.” “Georgiana is pretty, I presume, Bessie?” “Very. She went to London with her mother last winter and everyone admired her. A young lord even fell in love with her, but his family opposed the marriage. And can you believe it? He and Miss Georgiana planned to elope, but they were discovered and stopped. Miss Reed was the one who found them out – I think she was jealous. Now she and her sister are always fighting, like cats and dogs.” “And what about John Reed?” “Oh, he’s not doing as well as his mother hoped. He went to college and failed, or ‘got plucked’ I think they call it. Then his uncles wanted him to be a lawyer, but he’s so wild and irresponsible, I don’t think he’ll ever amount to much.” “What does he look like?” “He’s very tall. Some people say he’s handsome, but he has really thick lips.” “And Mrs. Reed?” “The mistress looks healthy enough in the face, but I don’t think she’s content. Mr. John’s behaviour upsets her, and he spends a great deal of money.” “Did she send you here, Bessie?” “No, not at all. But I’ve wanted to see you for a long time. When I heard you’d written and were moving away, I decided I had to come and see you before you were completely out of reach.” “I’m afraid I’ve disappointed you, Bessie,” I said with a laugh. I could see that while Bessie’s look showed affection, it certainly didn’t show admiration. “No, Miss Jane, not exactly. You’re proper enough; you look like a lady, and that’s as much as I ever expected from you. You weren’t a beauty as a child.” I smiled at Bessie’s honest reply. I knew it was true, but I must admit I wasn’t entirely unaffected by it. At eighteen, most people want to be appealing, and knowing one’s appearance isn’t likely to help that desire is anything but pleasant. “I suppose you’re clever, though,” Bessie continued, offering comfort. “What can you do? Can you play the piano?” “A little.” There was a piano in the room. Bessie went and opened it, then asked me to play something for her. I played a couple of waltzes, and she was delighted. “The Miss Reeds couldn’t play that well!” she said proudly. “I always said you’d be smarter than them. And can you draw?” “That landscape above the fireplace is one of my paintings.” It was a watercolour I had given to the superintendent as thanks for her help with the committee regarding me; she had it framed and glazed. “Wow, that’s beautiful, Miss Jane! That picture is as good as anything Miss Reed’s drawing teacher could do, let alone the young ladies themselves, who are nowhere near that good. And have you learned French?” “Yes, Bessie, I can both read and speak it.” “And you can do embroidery on fine cloth and canvas?” “Yes, I can.” “Oh, you’re completely a lady, Miss Jane! I knew you would be. You’ll succeed whether your relatives acknowledge you or not. There was something else I wanted to ask. Have you ever heard anything from your father’s family, the Eyres?” “Never.” “Well, you know the mistress always said they were poor and looked down upon. They might be poor, but I think they’re just as much gentry as the Reeds. Because one day, nearly seven years ago, a Mr. Eyre came to Gateshead asking to see you. The mistress said you were at school fifty miles away. He seemed very disappointed because he couldn’t stay; he was going on a sea voyage to a foreign country, and his ship was sailing from London in a day or two. He looked like a proper gentleman, and I believe he was your father’s brother.” “What foreign country was he going to, Bessie?” “An island thousands of miles away where they make wine – the butler told me…” “Madeira?” I suggested. “Yes, that’s it – that’s the exact word.” “So he went?” “Yes, he didn’t stay long. The mistress was very haughty with him; she later called him a ‘shifty tradesman.’ My Robert thinks he was a wine merchant.” “That’s very likely,” I replied. “Or perhaps a clerk or agent for one.”",
          "paraphrase_gpt-4.1-2025-04-14": "As I wandered anxiously through the hallway, a servant approached and informed me, \"Miss, someone downstairs wants to see you.\" Assuming it was the carrier, I hurried down without asking further questions. On my way to the kitchen, as I passed the partially open door of the teachers' sitting-room, a woman suddenly emerged and caught hold of me, exclaiming, \"It's her, I'm sure! I'd recognize her anywhere!\" Pausing, I saw before me a neatly dressed servant woman, with a matronly yet youthful appearance, striking features, black hair and eyes, and a lively complexion. With a familiar smile and voice, she asked me if I hadn't forgotten her, calling me Miss Jane. Realizing who she was, I excitedly hugged and kissed her, overjoyed to see Bessie again. She laughed and cried at the same time, and we both entered the sitting-room, where her little three-year-old boy stood by the fire. Bessie introduced the child as her son, Bobby, and told me she had been married for nearly five years to Robert Leaven the coachman, and that she also had a daughter named Jane. She explained she now lived at the lodge since the old porter had left. Curious about all the people at Gateshead, I invited her to sit and asked for news, but little Bobby chose to stay close to his mother rather than sit with me. Bessie remarked that I hadn't become much taller or stouter and compared me to the Reed girls, who were much more physically imposing. She confirmed that Georgiana was very pretty and had caused a stir in London, even attracting a young lord, though the relationship was stopped when Eliza Reed, possibly motivated by jealousy, discovered their plans to elope, leading to ongoing quarrels between the sisters. As for John Reed, Bessie explained he hadn't turned out as well as his mother hoped; he failed at college, rejected plans to study law, and lived a wasteful life, disappointing his family. When I asked about his appearance, she told me he was tall and considered handsome by some, but had thick lips. Mrs. Reed, she said, looked well but seemed troubled, especially by John's spending habits. Bessie clarified that she came to see me of her own accord, wishing to visit me before I left for another part of the country. Lightheartedly, I asked if she was disappointed in how I'd turned out, admitting that at eighteen I still cared about such things. Bessie honestly told me I looked as much like a lady as she had expected, though I was never a beauty as a child. She then asked about my accomplishments; I played a few tunes for her on the piano, which pleased her, and showed her a painting of mine, which she praised highly. She inquired whether I'd learned French and sewing, and upon hearing I had, congratulated me on my progress and confidence that I would succeed regardless of whether my relatives acknowledged me. Changing the subject, Bessie asked if I'd ever heard from my father's family, the Eyres. I said I had not. She recounted that some years ago, a Mr. Eyre—believed to be my father's brother—visited Gateshead to see me, but was unable to because I was away at school. He was about to depart on a voyage to a distant island known for wine-making—Madeira, I guessed. Bessie recalled that Mrs. Reed called him a \"sneaking tradesman\" afterward, though Bessie's husband Robert believed he was a wine-merchant or perhaps just an agent. I agreed that it was possible."

I wondered if Mrs. Fairfax lived alone except for the little girl; if so, and if she was at all kind, I felt sure we would get along. I resolved to make my best effort, though I regretted that doing one's best doesn't always work. At Lowood, my effort was appreciated, but Mrs. Reed always rejected me no matter what I did. I hoped Mrs. Fairfax wouldn't be another Mrs. Reed, but told myself that if she was, I wasn't obliged to stay. If the worst happened, I could just look for another job. I wondered how much farther we had to go."

We were now, as far as I could see, on a sort of common; but there were houses scattered all over the district; I felt we were in a different region to Lowood, more populous, less picturesque; more stirring, less romantic.\nThe roads were heavy, the night misty; my conductor let his horse walk all the way, and the hour and a half extended, I verily believe, to two hours; at last he turned in his seat and said—\n“You’re noan so far fro’ Thornfield now.”\nAgain I looked out: we were passing a church; I saw its low broad tower against the sky, and its bell was tolling a quarter; I saw a narrow galaxy of lights too, on a hillside, marking a village or hamlet. About ten minutes after, the driver got down and opened a pair of gates: we passed through, and they clashed to behind us. We now slowly ascended a drive, and came upon the long front of a house: candlelight gleamed from one curtained bow-window; all the rest were dark. The car stopped at the front door; it was opened by a maid-servant; I alighted and went in.\n“Will you walk this way, ma’am?” said the girl; and I followed her across a square hall with high doors all round: she ushered me into a room whose double illumination of fire and candle at first dazzled me, contrasting as it did with the darkness to which my eyes had been for two hours inured; when I could see, however, a cosy and agreeable picture presented itself to my view.\nA snug small room; a round table by a cheerful fire; an arm-chair high-backed and old-fashioned, wherein sat the neatest imaginable little elderly lady, in widow’s cap, black silk gown, and snowy muslin apron; exactly like what I had fancied Mrs. Fairfax, only less stately and milder looking. She was occupied in knitting; a large cat sat demurely at her feet; nothing in short was wanting to complete the beau-ideal of domestic comfort. A more reassuring introduction for a new governess could scarcely be conceived; there was no grandeur to overwhelm, no stateliness to embarrass; and then, as I entered, the old lady got up and promptly and kindly came forward to meet me.",
          "paraphrase_gemini-2.5-flash-preview-04-17": "Lowering the window, I looked outside. Millcote was now behind us, and judging by the number of lights, it appeared to be a significantly sized place, much larger than Lowton. From what I could see, we were now on what seemed like an open common, though houses were spread throughout the area. I sensed we had arrived in a different kind of place than Lowood – more densely populated and less scenic, more lively and less peaceful.The roads were difficult to travel on, and the night was foggy. My driver let his horse walk the entire way, stretching the hour and a half journey, I genuinely believe, to two full hours. Finally, he turned and spoke, saying, \"You're not very far from Thornfield now.\"I looked out again: we were driving past a church; I could see its short, wide tower against the sky, and its bell was ringing the quarter hour. I also saw a faint line of lights on a distant hillside, indicating a village or small settlement. About ten minutes later, the driver got down and opened a set of gates. We went through, and they closed loudly behind us. We then slowly drove up a path and approached the long facade of a house. Light shone from one bay window with curtains; all the other windows were dark. The carriage stopped at the main entrance, which was opened by a maid. I stepped out and went inside.\"Please come this way, ma'am,\" the maid said, and I followed her across a square hall with tall doors surrounding it. She led me into a room where the combined light from the fire and candles initially blinded me, a stark contrast to the darkness my eyes had grown used to for two hours. However, once my vision adjusted, I saw a pleasant and comfortable scene.It was a comfortable, small room with a round table next to a cheerful fire. In a high-backed, old-fashioned armchair sat a remarkably neat little elderly lady. She wore a widow's cap, a black silk dress, and a spotless white muslin apron. She looked exactly like I had imagined Mrs. Fairfax, only less imposing and with a gentler appearance. She was busy knitting, and a large cat sat calmly at her feet. In short, the scene perfectly embodied the ideal of domestic comfort. It's hard to imagine a more welcoming first impression for a new governess; there was no grandness to intimidate, no formality to make me feel awkward. And then, as I entered, the old lady stood up and came forward quickly and kindly to greet me.",
          "paraphrase_gpt-4.1-2025-04-14": "I lowered the carriage window and gazed outside; we had left Millcote behind us and, based on its many lights, it seemed much bigger than Lowton. Now we appeared to be crossing open common land, but there were houses dotted all around. I felt we were in a place unlike Lowood—more crowded, less scenic; livelier but less charming. The roads were rough, and a night mist hung in the air. My driver let his horse go slowly, so the journey stretched from the expected hour and a half to nearly two hours. Eventually, he turned and told me we were close to Thornfield. I looked out again and saw we were passing a church; its low, broad tower stood against the sky, and its bell was ringing the quarter hour. I also spotted a string of lights on a hill, showing where a village or hamlet was. After about ten more minutes, the driver stopped, got out, and opened some gates; we went through and the gates closed loudly behind us.

Seated there was a tidy little elderly woman in a widow’s cap, black silk dress, and white apron—just as I’d imagined Mrs. Fairfax, though gentler and less imposing. She was quietly knitting, with a calm cat by her feet; nothing was missing from this ideal picture of domestic comfort. A new governess could hardly have wished for a warmer welcome—there was no intimidating grandeur, no stiffness, and as I entered, the old lady immediately got up and kindly greeted me."

I inquired if she was Mrs. Fairfax, to which she confirmed and urged me to sit. She guided me to her chair and began helping me remove my outer layers, though I protested it was too much trouble. She insisted it was fine, suggesting my hands must be cold, and instructed a servant named Leah to prepare a hot drink and sandwiches, handing her the pantry keys. Producing a set of keys from her pocket – a symbol of her domestic role – she gave them to the servant. She then encouraged me to get closer to the fire, asking if I had brought my luggage. When I confirmed, she said she would see to it being taken to my room and quickly left. I thought to myself, 'She's treating me like a visitor.' I hadn't expected such a welcoming reception; I had anticipated formality and coolness. This wasn't like the accounts I'd heard of how governesses were treated, but I cautioned myself not to assume this kindness would last.

To be sure it is pleasant at any time; for Thornfield is a fine old hall, rather neglected of late years perhaps, but still it is a respectable place; yet you know in winter-time one feels dreary quite alone in the best quarters. I say alone—Leah is a nice girl to be sure, and John and his wife are very decent people; but then you see they are only servants, and one can’t converse with them on terms of equality: one must keep them at due distance, for fear of losing one’s authority. I’m sure last winter (it was a very severe one, if you recollect, and when it did not snow, it rained and blew), not a creature but the butcher and postman came to the house, from November till February; and I really got quite melancholy with sitting night after night alone; I had Leah in to read to me sometimes; but I don’t think the poor girl liked the task much: she felt it confining. In spring and summer one got on better: sunshine and long days make such a difference; and then, just at the commencement of this autumn, little Adela Varens came and her nurse: a child makes a house alive all at once; and now you are here I shall be quite gay.”\nMy heart really warmed to the worthy lady as I heard her talk; and I drew my chair a little nearer to her, and expressed my sincere wish that she might find my company as agreeable as she anticipated.\n“But I’ll not keep you sitting up late to-night,” said she; “it is on the stroke of twelve now, and you have been travelling all day: you must feel tired. If you have got your feet well warmed, I’ll show you your bedroom. I’ve had the room next to mine prepared for you; it is only a small apartment, but I thought you would like it better than one of the large front chambers: to be sure they have finer furniture, but they are so dreary and solitary, I never sleep in them myself.”\nI thanked her for her considerate choice, and as I really felt fatigued with my long journey, expressed my readiness to retire. She took her candle, and I followed her from the room. First she went to see if the hall-door was fastened; having taken the key from the lock, she led the way upstairs. The steps and banisters were of oak; the staircase window was high and latticed; both it and the long gallery into which the bedroom doors opened looked as if they belonged to a church rather than a house. A very chill and vault-like air pervaded the stairs and gallery, suggesting cheerless ideas of space and solitude; and I was glad, when finally ushered into my chamber, to find it of small dimensions, and furnished in ordinary, modern style.\nWhen Mrs. Fairfax had bidden me a kind good-night, and I had fastened my door, gazed leisurely round, and in some measure effaced the eerie impression made by that wide hall, that dark and spacious staircase, and that long, cold gallery, by the livelier aspect of my little room, I remembered that, after a day of bodily fatigue and mental anxiety, I was now at last in safe haven. The impulse of gratitude swelled my heart, and I knelt down at the bedside, and offered up thanks where thanks were due; not forgetting, ere I rose, to implore aid on my further path, and the power of meriting the kindness which seemed so frankly offered me before it was earned. My couch had no thorns in it that night; my solitary room no fears. At once weary and content, I slept soon and soundly: when I awoke it was broad day.",
          "paraphrase_gemini-2.5-flash-preview-04-17": "“I’m truly happy,” she went on, settling into a seat across from me with the cat in her lap; “I’m so delighted you’re here; having a companion will make living here much more pleasant. Of course, it’s always agreeable in a way; Thornfield is a fine old estate, perhaps somewhat neglected recently, but still respectable. Yet, you know, being completely alone in the best rooms can feel quite bleak during winter. When I say alone, Leah is certainly a good girl, and John and his wife are very decent people; but you see, they are just servants, and you can’t converse with them as equals. You have to maintain a certain distance to uphold your authority. I’m certain last winter (which was very harsh, if you recall, and either snowed or rained and blew constantly), nobody but the butcher and postman visited the house from November until February. I honestly became quite downhearted sitting by myself night after night. Sometimes I had Leah read to me, but I don’t think the poor girl enjoyed it much; she found it restrictive. Things were better in spring and summer; sunshine and longer days make such a difference. And then, just as autumn began this year, little Adela Varens and her nurse arrived. A child instantly brings a house to life. Now that you are here, I shall be quite cheerful.” Listening to the kind lady speak, my heart genuinely warmed to her. I pulled my chair slightly closer and expressed my sincere hope that she would find my company as agreeable as she anticipated. “But I won’t keep you up late tonight,” she said; “it’s nearly midnight now, and you’ve been travelling all day; you must be tired. If your feet are warm enough, I’ll show you to your room. I’ve had the room next to mine prepared for you. It’s only a small room, but I thought you’d prefer it to one of the large front bedrooms. They have better furniture, certainly, but they are so grim and isolated, I never sleep in them myself.” I thanked her for her thoughtful choice and, feeling truly exhausted from my long journey, said I was ready to retire. She picked up her candle, and I followed her out of the room. First, she checked that the main door was bolted, taking the key from the lock before leading the way upstairs. The steps and handrail were made of oak. The staircase window was high and had a lattice. Both it and the long corridor off which the bedroom doors opened seemed more suited to a church than a house. A very cold, tomb-like atmosphere filled the stairs and gallery, evoking cheerless thoughts of emptiness and solitude. I was relieved, therefore, when finally guided into my room, to find it small and furnished in a plain, contemporary style. After Mrs. Fairfax bid me a kind goodnight, and I had locked my door, surveyed the room at leisure, and somewhat dispelled the unsettling feeling left by that vast hall, dark, expansive staircase, and long, cold gallery with the more lively appearance of my little room, I remembered that after a day of physical exhaustion and mental worry, I was at last in a safe refuge. A wave of gratitude swelled in my chest, and I knelt by the bed to offer thanks where they were due, not forgetting, before I rose, to ask for guidance on my future path and the strength to deserve the kindness so freely offered before it was earned. My bed held no discomforts that night; my solitary room held no fears. Tired but content, I fell asleep quickly and deeply. When I woke, it was full daylight.",
          "paraphrase_gpt-4.1-2025-04-14": "She expressed her happiness at my arrival, saying how pleased she was to finally have someone to share the house with, as it would make living there much more enjoyable. Although Thornfield was a grand old home, she admitted it had become a bit neglected and could feel quite lonely, especially in winter. She explained that while the servants were good and respectable people, they were still staff, and it wasn’t appropriate to be too familiar with them, as that might impact her authority. She described how isolated she had felt during the previous harsh winter, when only the butcher and postman visited for months, which left her feeling rather down. Leah the servant sometimes read to her, but didn’t seem to enjoy it. In better seasons, the longer days and sunshine lifted her spirits, and the arrival of little Adela Varens and her nurse had brought life to the house. Now that I was there, she felt she would be quite cheerful. Her friendly manner warmed my heart, and I moved closer, sincerely hoping she would find my company as pleasant as she anticipated. Not wanting to keep me up late after my long journey, she said she would show me my room if I was ready, having prepared a small bedroom right next to hers, believing I’d prefer its coziness to the larger, grander but more lonely chambers. I thanked her for her kindness and, feeling tired, agreed to go to bed. She checked the hall door, took the key, and led me up the oak staircase with its high, latticed window, the hallway and stairs giving a cold, spacious, almost church-like atmosphere. I was relieved to find my room warm, small, and simply furnished. Once Mrs. Fairfax wished me good night and I was alone, I locked my door, looked around, and felt reassured by the comfort of my room after the intimidating halls. Grateful to have arrived safely at last after a tiring and anxious day, I knelt by my bed to give thanks and ask for support in the future, hoping to deserve the friendliness shown to me. My rest was undisturbed, and I slept well, waking up when it was already daylight."

Externals have a great effect on the young: I thought that a fairer era of life was beginning for me, one that was to have its flowers and pleasures, as well as its thorns and toils. My faculties, roused by the change of scene, the new field offered to hope, seemed all astir. I cannot precisely define what they expected, but it was something pleasant: not perhaps that day or that month, but at an indefinite future period.\nI rose; I dressed myself with care: obliged to be plain—for I had no article of attire that was not made with extreme simplicity—I was still by nature solicitous to be neat. It was not my habit to be disregardful of appearance or careless of the impression I made: on the contrary, I ever wished to look as well as I could, and to please as much as my want of beauty would permit. I sometimes regretted that I was not handsomer; I sometimes wished to have rosy cheeks, a straight nose, and small cherry mouth; I desired to be tall, stately, and finely developed in figure; I felt it a misfortune that I was so little, so pale, and had features so irregular and so marked. And why had I these aspirations and these regrets? It would be difficult to say: I could not then distinctly say it to myself; yet I had a reason, and a logical, natural reason too. However, when I had brushed my hair very smooth, and put on my black frock—which, Quakerlike as it was, at least had the merit of fitting to a nicety—and adjusted my clean white tucker, I thought I should do respectably enough to appear before Mrs. Fairfax, and that my new pupil would not at least recoil from me with antipathy. Having opened my chamber window, and seen that I left all things straight and neat on the toilet table, I ventured forth.\nTraversing the long and matted gallery, I descended the slippery steps of oak; then I gained the hall: I halted there a minute; I looked at some pictures on the walls (one, I remember, represented a grim man in a cuirass, and one a lady with powdered hair and a pearl necklace), at a bronze lamp pendent from the ceiling, at a great clock whose case was of oak curiously carved, and ebon black with time and rubbing. Everything appeared very stately and imposing to me; but then I was so little accustomed to grandeur. The hall-door, which was half of glass, stood open; I stepped over the threshold. It was a fine autumn morning; the early sun shone serenely on embrowned groves and still green fields; advancing on to the lawn, I looked up and surveyed the front of the mansion. It was three storeys high, of proportions not vast, though considerable: a gentleman’s manor-house, not a nobleman’s seat: battlements round the top gave it a picturesque look. Its grey front stood out well from the background of a rookery, whose cawing tenants were now on the wing: they flew over the lawn and grounds to alight in a great meadow, from which these were separated by a sunk fence, and where an array of mighty old thorn trees, strong, knotty, and broad as oaks, at once explained the etymology of the mansion’s designation. Farther off were hills: not so lofty as those round Lowood, nor so craggy, nor so like barriers of separation from the living world; but yet quiet and lonely hills enough, and seeming to embrace Thornfield with a seclusion I had not expected to find existent so near the stirring locality of Millcote. A little hamlet, whose roofs were blent with trees, straggled up the side of one of these hills; the church of the district stood nearer Thornfield: its old tower-top looked over a knoll between the house and gates.",
          "paraphrase_gemini-2.5-flash-preview-04-17": "The chamber felt so bright and cheerful to me as the sunlight streamed through the vibrant blue floral window curtains, revealing walls covered in wallpaper and a floor with carpet. This was such a contrast to the plain wooden floors and stained plaster at Lowood that it made my spirits rise. External appearances have a significant impact on young people. I believed that a more promising period of life was beginning for me, one that would include both enjoyable experiences and pleasures, as well as challenges and hard work. My abilities, stimulated by the change of environment and the new opportunities for hope, seemed fully awakened. I couldn't specifically say what exactly they anticipated, but it was something positive, perhaps not right away, but at some undefined point in the future. I got up and dressed carefully. Though I had to dress simply because all my clothes were made very plainly, I was naturally inclined to be neat. It wasn't my usual tendency to disregard my appearance or not care about the impression I made. On the contrary, I always wanted to look my best and be as pleasing as my lack of beauty allowed. I sometimes regretted not being more attractive; I occasionally wished I had rosy cheeks, a straight nose, and a small, pretty mouth. I wanted to be tall, dignified, and have a well-developed figure. I felt it was a misfortune that I was so small, so pale, and had such irregular and prominent features. And why did I have these desires and regrets? It would be difficult to articulate. I couldn't clearly explain it to myself at the time, yet I did have a reason, and a perfectly logical, natural one at that. However, after smoothing my hair meticulously and putting on my simple black dress—which, despite its plainness, fit quite well—and adjusting my clean white collar, I felt I would be presentable enough to meet Mrs. Fairfax and that my new pupil wouldn't immediately recoil from me in dislike. After opening my room window and ensuring everything on the dressing table was tidy, I ventured out. Walking along the long, carpeted hallway, I went down the slippery oak stairs. Then I reached the main hall. I paused there for a minute, looking at some paintings on the walls (I recall one showed a stern man in armor, and another a lady with powdered hair and a pearl necklace), at a bronze lamp hanging from the ceiling, and at a large clock whose intricately carved oak case was darkened like ebony from age and polishing. Everything struck me as very grand and impressive, but then I was so unaccustomed to luxury. The front door, which was partly glass, was open, and I stepped across the threshold. It was a beautiful autumn morning. The early sun shone gently on the brown woodlands and still green fields. Stepping onto the lawn, I looked up and surveyed the front of the mansion. It was three stories high, of substantial but not immense proportions—more a gentleman's large house than a nobleman's vast estate. Battlements along the top gave it a picturesque appearance. Its grey facade stood out well against the background of a rookery, whose cawing inhabitants were now flying. They flew over the lawn and grounds towards a large meadow, which was separated by a sunken fence and contained many large, old thorn trees, strong, gnarled, and as thick as oaks, which immediately clarified how the mansion got its name. Further off were hills, not as high as those around Lowood, nor as rocky, nor as isolating barriers from the outside world. Yet, they were quiet and solitary hills nonetheless, seeming to enclose Thornfield in a seclusion I hadn't expected to find so close to the busy area of Millcote. A small cluster of houses, their roofs blending with trees, sprawled up the side of one of these hills. The local church was nearer to Thornfield; its old tower peak was visible over a small hill between the house and the gates.",

The surroundings can greatly influence young people; I felt as if a happier chapter of my life was starting, one that would have both joys and hardships. The change in environment awakened my senses and hope, though I couldn’t clearly say what I anticipated, only that I looked forward to something good, someday in the future. \n\nI got up and dressed carefully. My wardrobe was modest and simple, but I always tried to present myself neatly. I cared about how I looked and the impression I made on others, wishing I was more attractive—wishing for rosy cheeks, a straight nose, a petite mouth, a taller, graceful figure—instead of being small, pale, and with distinct, irregular features. I did not fully understand why I longed for these things, but these feelings were real. Still, after brushing my hair smooth, putting on my well-fitting black dress, and arranging my clean collar, I felt presentable enough to meet Mrs. Fairfax and hoped my new student wouldn't find me off-putting. After opening my window and tidying my room, I left.\n\nI passed through a long hallway with a thick carpet and carefully descended slippery oak stairs to the hall. I paused to look at some paintings—one of a severe man in armor, another of a lady with powdered hair and pearls—a hanging bronze lamp, and an ornate old oak clock. Everything seemed magnificent and formal to me, though I wasn't used to such grandeur. The hall door stood open, half-glass, and I stepped outside. It was a pleasant autumn morning; the early sun shone on the brown trees and green fields. On the lawn, I looked up to see the mansion's front: three stories high and large, but not immense—clearly a gentleman's home, not an aristocrat's estate—with battlements giving it a picturesque look. Its gray façade contrasted with the background of rooks taking flight over the grounds to a large meadow, separated by a sunken fence and shaded by huge, ancient thorn trees, whose presence explained the house’s name. Beyond were hills, not as high or rugged as those near Lowood, but still quiet and remote, lending Thornfield an unexpected sense of seclusion despite being close to the busy town of Millcote. A small village with houses blended among trees climbed one hillside; the district church, closer to Thornfield, overlooked a rise between the house and the entrance gates."

Outside already?” she remarked. “You seem to be an early riser.” I approached her and was greeted with an affectionate kiss and a handclasp.\n“How do you find Thornfield?” she inquired. I told her I liked it immensely.\n“Yes,” she said, “it’s an attractive spot; but I fear it will fall into disrepair unless Mr. Rochester decides to come and live here permanently; or, at least, visit somewhat more often: large residences and impressive grounds require the owner’s presence.”\n“Mr. Rochester!” I exclaimed. “Who is he?”\n“He is the proprietor of Thornfield,” she replied calmly. “Were you not aware he was named Rochester?”\nOf course I was not—I had never encountered his name before; but the elderly lady appeared to consider his existence a universally known fact, something everyone must instinctively be familiar with.\n“I had thought,” I continued, “that Thornfield belonged to you.”\n“To me?

I looked at my pupil, who did not at first appear to notice me: she was quite a child, perhaps seven or eight years old, slightly built, with a pale, small-featured face, and a redundancy of hair falling in curls to her waist.\n“Good morning, Miss Adela,” said Mrs. Fairfax. “Come and speak to the lady who is to teach you, and to make you a clever woman some day.” She approached.\n“C’est là ma gouvernante!” said she, pointing to me, and addressing her nurse; who answered—\n“Mais oui, certainement.”\n“Are they foreigners?” I inquired, amazed at hearing the French language.\n“The nurse is a foreigner, and Adela was born on the Continent; and, I believe, never left it till within six months ago. When she first came here she could speak no English; now she can make shift to talk it a little: I don’t understand her, she mixes it so with French; but you will make out her meaning very well, I dare say.”\nFortunately I had had the advantage of being taught French by a French lady; and as I had always made a point of conversing with Madame Pierrot as often as I could, and had besides, during the last seven years, learnt a portion of French by heart daily—applying myself to take pains with my accent, and imitating as closely as possible the pronunciation of my teacher, I had acquired a certain degree of readiness and correctness in the language, and was not likely to be much at a loss with Mademoiselle Adela. She came and shook hands with me when she heard that I was her governess; and as I led her in to breakfast, I addressed some phrases to her in her own tongue: she replied briefly at first, but after we were seated at the table, and she had examined me some ten minutes with her large hazel eyes, she suddenly commenced chattering fluently.\n“Ah!” cried she, in French, “you speak my language as well as Mr. Rochester does: I can talk to you as I can to him, and so can Sophie. She will be glad: nobody here understands her: Madame Fairfax is all English. Sophie is my nurse; she came with me over the sea in a great ship with a chimney that smoked—how it did smoke!—and I was sick, and so was Sophie, and so was Mr. Rochester. Mr. Rochester lay down on a sofa in a pretty room called the salon, and Sophie and I had little beds in another place. I nearly fell out of mine; it was like a shelf. And Mademoiselle—what is your name?”\n“Eyre—Jane Eyre.”\n“Aire? Bah! I cannot say it. Well, our ship stopped in the morning, before it was quite daylight, at a great city—a huge city, with very dark houses and all smoky; not at all like the pretty clean town I came from; and Mr. Rochester carried me in his arms over a plank to the land, and Sophie came after, and we all got into a coach, which took us to a beautiful large house, larger than this and finer, called an hotel. We stayed there nearly a week: I and Sophie used to walk every day in a great green place full of trees, called the Park; and there were many children there besides me, and a pond with beautiful birds in it, that I fed with crumbs.”\n“Can you understand her when she runs on so fast?” asked Mrs. Fairfax.\nI understood her very well, for I had been accustomed to the fluent tongue of Madame Pierrot.\n“I wish,” continued the good lady, “you would ask her a question or two about her parents: I wonder if she remembers them?”\n“Adèle,” I inquired, “with whom did you live when you were in that pretty clean town you spoke of?”\n“I lived long ago with mama; but she is gone to the Holy Virgin. Mama used to teach me to dance and sing, and to say verses. A great many gentlemen and ladies came to see mama, and I used to dance before them, or to sit on their knees and sing to them: I liked it. Shall I let you hear me sing now?”\nShe had finished her breakfast, so I permitted her to give a specimen of her accomplishments. Descending from her chair, she came and placed herself on my knee; then, folding her little hands demurely before her, shaking back her curls and lifting her eyes to the ceiling, she commenced singing a song from some opera. It was the strain of a forsaken lady, who, after bewailing the perfidy of her lover, calls pride to her aid; desires her attendant to deck her in her brightest jewels and richest robes, and resolves to meet the false one that night at a ball, and prove to him, by the gaiety of her demeanour, how little his desertion has affected her.\nThe subject seemed strangely chosen for an infant singer; but I suppose the point of the exhibition lay in hearing the notes of love and jealousy warbled with the lisp of childhood; and in very bad taste that point was: at least I thought so.\nAdèle sang the canzonette tunefully enough, and with the naïveté of her age. This achieved, she jumped from my knee and said, “Now, Mademoiselle, I will repeat you some poetry.”\nAssuming an attitude, she began, “La Ligue des Rats: fable de La Fontaine.” She then declaimed the little piece with an attention to punctuation and emphasis, a flexibility of voice and an appropriateness of gesture, very unusual indeed at her age, and which proved she had been carefully trained.\n“Was it your mama who taught you that piece?” I asked.\n“Yes, and she just used to say it in this way: ‘Qu’avez vous donc? lui dit un de ces rats; parlez!’ She made me lift my hand—so—to remind me to raise my voice at the question. Now shall I dance for you?”\n“No, that will do: but after your mama went to the Holy Virgin, as you say, with whom did you live then?”\n“With Madame Frédéric and her husband: she took care of me, but she is nothing related to me. I think she is poor, for she had not so fine a house as mama. I was not long there. Mr. Rochester asked me if I would like to go and live with him in England, and I said yes; for I knew Mr. Rochester before I knew Madame Frédéric, and he was always kind to me and gave me pretty dresses and toys: but you see he has not kept his word, for he has brought me to England, and now he is gone back again himself, and I never see him.”",

I observed my potential student, who initially didn't seem to see me. She was clearly a child, around seven or eight years old, with a delicate build, a pale face featuring small features, and an abundance of curly hair that reached down to her waist. \"Good morning, Miss Adela,\" greeted Mrs. Fairfax. \"Come and speak to the lady who will be your teacher and help you become a clever woman one day.\" Adela approached. She pointed at me and told her nurse in French, \"That's my governess!\" Her nurse replied, \"Yes, certainly.\" Surprised to hear French, I asked, \"Are they foreigners?\" \"The nurse is foreign, and Adela was born on the Continent,\" Mrs. Fairfax explained. \"I don't think she left it until about six months ago. When she arrived, she couldn't speak any English, but now she manages a little. I can't understand her because she mixes English and French so much, but I'm sure you'll understand her meaning quite well.\" Luckily, I had been taught French by a Frenchwoman and had made an effort to converse with Madame Pierrot frequently. Additionally, for the past seven years, I had regularly memorized French passages daily, focusing on improving my accent and mimicking my teacher's pronunciation. Because of this, I had become reasonably fluent and accurate in the language and didn't expect to have much trouble with Mademoiselle Adela. When she learned I was her governess, she came and shook my hand. As I guided her towards breakfast, I spoke a few sentences to her in French. She initially gave brief answers, but after we were seated at the table and she had studied me for about ten minutes with her large, light brown eyes, she suddenly started talking nonstop. \"Oh!\" she exclaimed in French, \"You speak my language as well as Mr. Rochester does! I can talk to you just like I talk to him, and Sophie can too. She'll be happy because no one here understands her; Madame Fairfax is completely English. Sophie is my nurse; she came with me across the sea on a big ship with a smoking chimney—it smoked so much!—and I was sick, and so was Sophie, and so was Mr. Rochester. Mr. Rochester lay down on a sofa in a beautiful room called the salon, and Sophie and I had small beds somewhere else. I almost fell out of mine; it was like a shelf. And Mademoiselle—what is your name?\" \"Eyre—Jane Eyre.\" \"Aire? Bah! I can't say that. Well, our ship stopped in the morning, before it was fully light, at a huge city—a massive, smoky city with very dark buildings, not at all like the lovely, clean town I came from. Mr. Rochester carried me ashore over a plank, and Sophie followed. We all got into a carriage that took us to a beautiful, large house, bigger and grander than this one, called an hotel. We stayed there for almost a week. Sophie and I walked every day in a large green area full of trees, called the Park. There were many other children there, and a pond with beautiful birds that I fed with crumbs.\" Mrs. Fairfax asked, \"Can you understand her when she chatters on so quickly?\" I understood her perfectly, as I was used to Madame Pierrot's rapid speech. \"I wish,\" the kind lady continued, \"you would ask her a question or two about her parents. I wonder if she remembers them?\" \"Adèle,\" I asked, \"who did you live with when you were in that lovely, clean town you mentioned?\" \"A long time ago, I lived with mama, but she has gone to the Holy Virgin. Mama used to teach me dancing, singing, and saying verses. Many gentlemen and ladies visited mama, and I would dance for them or sit on their laps and sing to them. I liked it. Would you like to hear me sing now?\" She had finished her breakfast, so I allowed her to demonstrate her talents. She got down from her chair, came and sat on my knee, folded her little hands neatly, pushed back her curls, looked up at the ceiling, and began singing a song from an opera. It was the song of an abandoned woman who, after lamenting her lover's betrayal, turns to pride, asks her attendant to dress her in her best jewels and richest clothes, and decides to meet the faithless man at a ball that night to show him through her cheerful manner how little his leaving has affected her. The choice of song seemed very strange for a child singer, but I suppose the appeal of the performance was hearing expressions of love and jealousy sung with a child's lisp. In my opinion, it was in very poor taste. Adèle sang the little tune pleasantly enough and with childish innocence. After finishing, she jumped off my knee and said, \"Now, Mademoiselle, I will recite some poetry for you.\" She struck a pose and began, \"La Ligue des Rats: fable de La Fontaine.\" She then recited the short piece, paying attention to pauses and emphasis, varying her voice, and using appropriate gestures, which was truly exceptional for her age and showed she had received careful training. \"Was it your mama who taught you that piece?\" I inquired. \"Yes, and she used to say it just like this: 'What's wrong? one of those rats said to him; speak!' She made me lift my hand—like this—to remind me to raise my voice for the question. Now, shall I dance for you?\" \"No, that's enough for now. But after your mama went to the Holy Virgin, as you said, who did you live with then?\" \"With Madame Frédéric and her husband. She looked after me, but she's not related to me at all. I think she's poor because her house wasn't as nice as mama's. I didn't stay there long. Mr. Rochester asked me if I would like to live with him in England, and I said yes, because I knew Mr. Rochester before I knew Madame Frédéric, and he was always kind to me and gave me pretty dresses and toys. But you see, he hasn't kept his promise, because he brought me to England, and now he's gone back himself, and I never see him.\"",
          "paraphrase_gpt-4.1-2025-04-14": "While I reflected on what I had just learned, a young girl followed by her nurse ran across the lawn. I observed my new student—she seemed not to notice me at first. She looked about seven or eight years old, was slender, pale, with delicate features and long, curly hair cascading down to her waist. \n\nMrs. Fairfax greeted her: “Good morning, Miss Adela. Come meet your new governess—she will help you become a learned woman one day.” The little girl approached. \n\nPointing at me, she told her nurse in French, “That is my governess!” The nurse responded affirmatively. \n\nSurprised to hear French, I asked, “Are they foreigners?” Mrs. Fairfax explained, “The nurse is not English, and Adela was born on the Continent. She only arrived in England about six months ago. When she first came, she couldn’t speak English at all and only now manages a little; I often can’t understand her as she mixes it with French, but you’ll manage.” \n\nLuckily, I had been taught French by a native and had kept up my practice, so I could converse readily enough with Adèle. When she learned I was her governess, she shook my hand, and I spoke to her in French. She was reserved at first, but while we were seated at breakfast and she had sized me up for several minutes, she suddenly became talkative. \n\nShe exclaimed in French, “You speak my language as well as Mr. Rochester—I can talk to you and Sophie now! Sophie is my nurse; she came with me on the big ship that smoked so much—we all got seasick, even Mr. Rochester. When we landed in a smoky, dark city, Mr. Rochester carried me ashore; then we stayed in a grand hotel for almost a week and visited a park with trees and a pond full of birds.”\n\nMrs. Fairfax asked if I could keep up with Adèle’s rapid French; thankfully, I could. Hoping to learn more, Mrs. Fairfax suggested I ask about her parents. \n\nSo I asked Adèle with whom she had lived before. She replied she used to live with her mother, who had now “gone to the Holy Virgin.” Her mother had taught her to dance, sing, and recite verses, and many people used to visit. Adèle offered to sing for me and, after finishing breakfast, did so with impressive poise and innocence for her age, though the song was quite adult in theme. She then eagerly recited a fable by La Fontaine, demonstrating remarkable skill and showing she had been well coached.\n\nWhen I asked, she confirmed her mother had taught her and explained some of the coaching techniques her mother had used. She even offered to dance, but I declined and gently pressed on: after her mother died, with whom did she live? With Madame Frédéric, who was not a relative and had a much humbler home. She was there only a short time before Mr. Rochester invited her to live in England. Adèle seemed disappointed that Mr. Rochester had since returned to the Continent and that she rarely saw him."

          "text_segment": "After breakfast, Adèle and I withdrew to the library, which room, it appears, Mr. Rochester had directed should be used as the schoolroom. Most of the books were locked up behind glass doors; but there was one bookcase left open containing everything that could be needed in the way of elementary works, and several volumes of light literature, poetry, biography, travels, a few romances, &c. I suppose he had considered that these were all the governess would require for her private perusal; and, indeed, they contented me amply for the present; compared with the scanty pickings I had now and then been able to glean at Lowood, they seemed to offer an abundant harvest of entertainment and information. In this room, too, there was a cabinet piano, quite new and of superior tone; also an easel for painting and a pair of globes.\nI found my pupil sufficiently docile, though disinclined to apply: she had not been used to regular occupation of any kind. I felt it would be injudicious to confine her too much at first; so, when I had talked to her a great deal, and got her to learn a little, and when the morning had advanced to noon, I allowed her to return to her nurse. I then proposed to occupy myself till dinner-time in drawing some little sketches for her use.\nAs I was going upstairs to fetch my portfolio and pencils, Mrs. Fairfax called to me: “Your morning school-hours are over now, I suppose,” said she. She was in a room the folding-doors of which stood open: I went in when she addressed me. It was a large, stately apartment, with purple chairs and curtains, a Turkey carpet, walnut-panelled walls, one vast window rich in stained glass, and a lofty ceiling, nobly moulded. Mrs. Fairfax was dusting some vases of fine purple spar, which stood on a sideboard.\n“What a beautiful room!” I exclaimed, as I looked round; for I had never before seen any half so imposing.\n“Yes; this is the dining-room. I have just opened the window, to let in a little air and sunshine; for everything gets so damp in apartments that are seldom inhabited; the drawing-room yonder feels like a vault.”\nShe pointed to a wide arch corresponding to the window, and hung like it with a Tyrian-dyed curtain, now looped up. Mounting to it by two broad steps, and looking through, I thought I caught a glimpse of a fairy place, so bright to my novice-eyes appeared the view beyond. Yet it was merely a very pretty drawing-room, and within it a boudoir, both spread with white carpets, on which seemed laid brilliant garlands of flowers; both ceiled with snowy mouldings of white grapes and vine-leaves, beneath which glowed in rich contrast crimson couches and ottomans; while the ornaments on the pale Parian mantelpiece were of sparkling Bohemian glass, ruby red; and between the windows large mirrors repeated the general blending of snow and fire.\n“In what order you keep these rooms, Mrs. Fairfax!” said I. “No dust, no canvas coverings: except that the air feels chilly, one would think they were inhabited daily.”\n“Why, Miss Eyre, though Mr. Rochester’s visits here are rare, they are always sudden and unexpected; and as I observed that it put him out to find everything swathed up, and to have a bustle of arrangement on his arrival, I thought it best to keep the rooms in readiness.”\n“Is Mr. Rochester an exacting, fastidious sort of man?”\n“Not particularly so; but he has a gentleman’s tastes and habits, and he expects to have things managed in conformity to them.”\n“Do you like him? Is he generally liked?”\n“Oh, yes; the family have always been respected here. Almost all the land in this neighbourhood, as far as you can see, has belonged to the Rochesters time out of mind.”\n“Well, but, leaving his land out of the question, do you like him? Is he liked for himself?”\n“I have no cause to do otherwise than like him; and I believe he is considered a just and liberal landlord by his tenants: but he has never lived much amongst them.”\n“But has he no peculiarities? What, in short, is his character?”\n“Oh! his character is unimpeachable, I suppose. He is rather peculiar, perhaps: he has travelled a great deal, and seen a great deal of the world, I should think. I dare say he is clever, but I never had much conversation with him.”\n“In what way is he peculiar?”\n“I don’t know—it is not easy to describe—nothing striking, but you feel it when he speaks to you; you cannot be always sure whether he is in jest or earnest, whether he is pleased or the contrary; you don’t thoroughly understand him, in short—at least, I don’t: but it is of no consequence, he is a very good master.”\nThis was all the account I got from Mrs. Fairfax of her employer and mine. There are people who seem to have no notion of sketching a character, or observing and describing salient points, either in persons or things: the good lady evidently belonged to this class; my queries puzzled, but did not draw her out. Mr. Rochester was Mr. Rochester in her eyes; a gentleman, a landed proprietor—nothing more: she inquired and searched no further, and evidently wondered at my wish to gain a more definite notion of his identity.",
          "paraphrase_gemini-2.5-flash-preview-04-17": "Following breakfast, Adèle and I moved to the library, a room Mr. Rochester, it appeared, had designated for school use. Most books were stored behind locked glass panels, but one open shelf provided necessary basic educational materials along with various works of lighter reading, such as poetry, biographies, travel accounts, and some novels. I assumed these were deemed sufficient for the governess's personal reading, and indeed, they offered ample satisfaction for the time being; compared to the limited selection I had occasionally found at Lowood, this collection felt like a rich source of entertainment and knowledge. The room also featured a newly acquired cabinet piano with excellent sound, an easel for painting, and a pair of globes.\nMy student proved quite compliant, although she was reluctant to focus; she wasn't accustomed to structured activities. I felt it would be unwise to impose too much restriction initially, so after engaging her in conversation, teaching her a little, and as the morning transitioned into midday, I allowed her to return to her caregiver. I then planned to spend the time until dinner creating some small drawings for her.\nAs I headed upstairs to retrieve my drawing supplies, Mrs. Fairfax called out to me, saying, \"Your morning school session is finished now, I presume.\" She was in a room with open double doors, and I entered when she spoke. It was a large, impressive space furnished with purple chairs and drapes, a patterned Turkish rug, walls paneled in walnut wood, a single large window adorned with vibrant stained glass, and a tall ceiling featuring elegant molding. Mrs. Fairfax was cleaning some intricate purple spar vases placed on a side table.\n\"What a stunning room!\" I exclaimed, looking around, as I had never before seen anything half so grand.\n\"Yes, this is the dining room. I just opened the window to air it out and let in some sun, because rooms that aren't often used tend to become quite damp; the drawing-room next door feels like a tomb.\" \nShe indicated a wide arched doorway across from the window, similarly draped with a rich purple curtain, currently tied back. Stepping up the two broad steps and looking through, I felt as though I was glimpsing a magical realm, so dazzling was the sight to my inexperienced eyes. In reality, it was simply a very attractive drawing-room and an adjoining small sitting area, both covered in white carpets that looked like they were scattered with bright floral patterns. Both rooms had ceilings decorated with white moldings resembling bunches of grapes and vine leaves, beneath which contrasting crimson sofas and ottomans glowed richly, while the decorative items on the light-colored Parian marble mantelpiece were brilliant ruby-red Bohemian glass. Between the windows, large mirrors reflected the dominant theme of white and red.\n\"These rooms are kept in such perfect order, Mrs. Fairfax!\" I commented. \"No dust, no furniture coverings; if it weren't for the slight chill in the air, one would think they were occupied daily.\"\n\"Well, Miss Eyre,\" she replied, \"although Mr. Rochester visits rarely, his arrivals are always sudden and unexpected. I noticed that he was annoyed by finding everything covered and having to deal with a flurry of activity upon his arrival, so I decided it was best to keep the rooms prepared.\"\n\"Is Mr. Rochester a demanding, overly particular man?\"\n\"Not especially; but he possesses the tastes and habits of a gentleman, and he expects things to be managed according to them.\"\n\"Do you like him? Is he generally well-regarded?\"\n\"Oh, yes; the family has always commanded respect here. Nearly all the land you can see in this area has belonged to the Rochesters for generations.\"\n\"Alright, but setting aside his property, do you personally like him? Is he liked for himself?\"\n\"I have no reason not to like him, and I believe his tenants consider him a fair and generous landlord, but he hasn't spent much time living among them.\"\n\"But does he have any quirks? What, in essence, is his personality like?\"\n\"Oh, I suppose his character is faultless. He's perhaps a bit unusual; I believe he has traveled extensively and seen a great deal of the world. He's probably intelligent, but I've never had much conversation with him.\"\n\"In what way is he peculiar?\"\n\"I'm not sure—it's hard to describe—nothing obvious, but you sense it when he speaks to you; you can't always tell if he's joking or serious, whether he's pleased or annoyed; in short, you don't quite understand him—at least, I don't. But it's not important; he's a very good employer.\"\nThis was the extent of the description Mrs. Fairfax offered about her employer, and mine. Some individuals seem utterly incapable of evaluating a person's character or identifying and articulating significant traits in people or objects; the kind lady clearly fit this description. My questions confused her but didn't prompt her to elaborate. In her eyes, Mr. Rochester was simply Mr. Rochester; a gentleman, a landowner—nothing more. She didn't delve deeper and was clearly puzzled by my desire for a clearer understanding of his identity.",

Most of the books were locked away behind glass, but one open bookcase offered plenty of basic educational materials and various lighter reading—such as poetry, biographies, travel books, and some novels. I assumed Mr. Rochester thought that these would suffice for the governess’s needs, and, for now, I was more than satisfied; after the limited selection at Lowood, this collection seemed abundant and rich in both amusement and knowledge. The room also contained a new, high-quality piano, a painting easel, and a set of globes.\n\nAs for Adèle, she was compliant enough but not accustomed to steady work or discipline, so I decided not to enforce too strict a regime at first. After spending time talking with her and guiding her through a bit of learning, I let her return to her nurse at noon. I then planned to spend time drawing some simple sketches for her to use, intending to keep myself occupied until dinner.\n\nWhile heading upstairs for my art supplies, Mrs. Fairfax called to me, commenting that my teaching hours were probably over for the morning. She was in a grand room with open folding doors. When I joined her, I found myself in an impressive, spacious dining-room, decorated with purple furnishings, a Turkish carpet, panelled walls, a large stained-glass window, and a high, ornately-moulded ceiling. Mrs. Fairfax was dusting vases made from fine purple stone on a sideboard.\n\nI remarked on the room’s beauty, having never seen anything so impressive. Mrs. Fairfax replied that it was the dining-room, and she had opened the window to let in air and sunlight, as such little-used rooms tended to be damp; the adjacent drawing-room, she added, felt even colder. She indicated the drawing-room, which I glimpsed through a wide arch draped with a rich, purple curtain. Ascending two steps and peering in, I got the impression of a magical place, though it was merely a well-appointed drawing-room and boudoir. Both were laid with white carpets that had brilliant floral designs, and had ceilings decorated with white mouldings of grapes and vines. Deep red couches and ottomans contrasted with these pale features, and ruby-red glass ornaments decorated the mantelpiece. Large mirrors stood between the windows, reflecting the blend of white and fiery colors throughout the room.\n\nI complimented Mrs. Fairfax on the spotless state of the rooms, noting the absence of dust or protective coverings and remarking that they looked regularly inhabited, aside from feeling slightly chilly. Mrs. Fairfax explained that although Mr. Rochester visited infrequently, his arrivals were unpredictable. She kept the rooms ready at all times, having noticed he disliked arriving to find them covered up or to be greeted with hectic preparations.\n\nI asked if Mr. Rochester was a demanding and fussy person. She replied he wasn’t especially so, just that he had gentlemanly tastes and habits which he expected to be respected. I then asked whether she liked him and whether others did as well. She told me the Rochesters had always been respected in the area, owning much of the land, but when I asked specifically about Mr. Rochester himself, she said she had no reason to dislike him and believed his tenants thought him just and generous, though he didn’t live among them much.\n\nPressing further, I inquired if he had any peculiarities or anything distinct about his character. Mrs. Fairfax answered that his character was above reproach, though he might be seen as somewhat peculiar, probably because he had traveled widely and seen a lot. She guessed he was intelligent, though she herself hadn’t had many conversations with him. When I asked specifically in what way he was peculiar, she said she couldn’t exactly say—there was nothing obvious, but when he spoke you were never sure if he was joking or serious, or what he really felt; she, at least, did not find him easy to read, but insisted this was unimportant and that he was a good employer.\n\nThis was all the information I could get from Mrs. Fairfax about Mr. Rochester. Some people, like her, seemed unable to give a detailed portrait of a person or thing, failing to notice or describe distinctive traits. My questions only seemed to puzzle her; all she could really tell me was that Mr. Rochester was simply himself—a gentleman and a landowner, and nothing more; she saw no reason to inquire further and seemed surprised that I wanted a clearer idea of his personality."

          "text_segment": "When we left the dining-room, she proposed to show me over the rest of the house; and I followed her upstairs and downstairs, admiring as I went; for all was well arranged and handsome. The large front chambers I thought especially grand: and some of the third-storey rooms, though dark and low, were interesting from their air of antiquity. The furniture once appropriated to the lower apartments had from time to time been removed here, as fashions changed: and the imperfect light entering by their narrow casement showed bedsteads of a hundred years old; chests in oak or walnut, looking, with their strange carvings of palm branches and cherubs’ heads, like types of the Hebrew ark; rows of venerable chairs, high-backed and narrow; stools still more antiquated, on whose cushioned tops were yet apparent traces of half-effaced embroideries, wrought by fingers that for two generations had been coffin-dust. All these relics gave to the third storey of Thornfield Hall the aspect of a home of the past: a shrine of memory. I liked the hush, the gloom, the quaintness of these retreats in the day; but I by no means coveted a night’s repose on one of those wide and heavy beds: shut in, some of them, with doors of oak; shaded, others, with wrought old English hangings crusted with thick work, portraying effigies of strange flowers, and stranger birds, and strangest human beings,—all which would have looked strange, indeed, by the pallid gleam of moonlight.\n“Do the servants sleep in these rooms?” I asked.\n“No; they occupy a range of smaller apartments to the back; no one ever sleeps here: one would almost say that, if there were a ghost at Thornfield Hall, this would be its haunt.”\n“So I think: you have no ghost, then?”\n“None that I ever heard of,” returned Mrs. Fairfax, smiling.\n“Nor any traditions of one? no legends or ghost stories?”\n“I believe not. And yet it is said the Rochesters have been rather a violent than a quiet race in their time: perhaps, though, that is the reason they rest tranquilly in their graves now.”\n“Yes—‘after life’s fitful fever they sleep well,’” I muttered. “Where are you going now, Mrs. Fairfax?” for she was moving away.\n“On to the leads; will you come and see the view from thence?” I followed still, up a very narrow staircase to the attics, and thence by a ladder and through a trap-door to the roof of the hall. I was now on a level with the crow colony, and could see into their nests. Leaning over the battlements and looking far down, I surveyed the grounds laid out like a map: the bright and velvet lawn closely girdling the grey base of the mansion; the field, wide as a park, dotted with its ancient timber; the wood, dun and sere, divided by a path visibly overgrown, greener with moss than the trees were with foliage; the church at the gates, the road, the tranquil hills, all reposing in the autumn day’s sun; the horizon bounded by a propitious sky, azure, marbled with pearly white. No feature in the scene was extraordinary, but all was pleasing. When I turned from it and repassed the trap-door, I could scarcely see my way down the ladder; the attic seemed black as a vault compared with that arch of blue air to which I had been looking up, and to that sunlit scene of grove, pasture, and green hill, of which the hall was the centre, and over which I had been gazing with delight.\nMrs. Fairfax stayed behind a moment to fasten the trap-door; I, by dint of groping, found the outlet from the attic, and proceeded to descend the narrow garret staircase. I lingered in the long passage to which this led, separating the front and back rooms of the third storey: narrow, low, and dim, with only one little window at the far end, and looking, with its two rows of small black doors all shut, like a corridor in some Bluebeard’s castle.\nWhile I paced softly on, the last sound I expected to hear in so still a region, a laugh, struck my ear. It was a curious laugh; distinct, formal, mirthless. I stopped: the sound ceased, only for an instant; it began again, louder: for at first, though distinct, it was very low. It passed off in a clamorous peal that seemed to wake an echo in every lonely chamber; though it originated but in one, and I could have pointed out the door whence the accents issued.\n“Mrs. Fairfax!” I called out: for I now heard her descending the great stairs. “Did you hear that loud laugh? Who is it?”\n“Some of the servants, very likely,” she answered: “perhaps Grace Poole.”\n“Did you hear it?” I again inquired.\n“Yes, plainly: I often hear her: she sews in one of these rooms. Sometimes Leah is with her; they are frequently noisy together.”\nThe laugh was repeated in its low, syllabic tone, and terminated in an odd murmur.\n“Grace!” exclaimed Mrs. Fairfax.\nI really did not expect any Grace to answer; for the laugh was as tragic, as preternatural a laugh as any I ever heard; and, but that it was high noon, and that no circumstance of ghostliness accompanied the curious cachinnation; but that neither scene nor season favoured fear, I should have been superstitiously afraid. However, the event showed me I was a fool for entertaining a sense even of surprise.\nThe door nearest me opened, and a servant came out,—a woman of between thirty and forty; a set, square-made figure, red-haired, and with a hard, plain face: any apparition less romantic or less ghostly could scarcely be conceived.\n“Too much noise, Grace,” said Mrs. Fairfax. “Remember directions!” Grace curtseyed silently and went in.\n“She is a person we have to sew and assist Leah in her housemaid’s work,” continued the widow; “not altogether unobjectionable in some points, but she does well enough. By-the-bye, how have you got on with your new pupil this morning?”\nThe conversation, thus turned on Adèle, continued till we reached the light and cheerful region below. Adèle came running to meet us in the hall, exclaiming—\n“Mesdames, vous êtes servies!” adding, “J’ai bien faim, moi!”\nWe found dinner ready, and waiting for us in Mrs. Fairfax’s room.",
          "paraphrase_gemini-2.5-flash-preview-04-17": "After we finished in the dining room, she suggested giving me a tour of the rest of the house. I followed her as we went up and down stairs, finding everything attractive and well-organized. I was particularly impressed by the large main bedrooms in the front. While dark and low-ceilinged, some of the rooms on the third floor were interesting due to their old age. As fashion changed over the years, furniture originally used in the lower parts of the house had been moved up here. The limited light coming through their narrow windows revealed century-old bedsteads; chests made of oak or walnut adorned with strange carvings of palm branches and cherub heads, resembling ancient religious relics; rows of old, tall, narrow chairs; and even older stools with cushioned seats showing faint signs of embroidery made by people long gone. These antique pieces gave the third floor of Thornfield Hall the feel of a house from the past, a place of remembrance. I appreciated the quietness, the dim light, and the peculiar character of these spaces during the day. However, I had no desire to spend a night on one of those large, heavy beds. Some were enclosed by wooden doors, while others were draped with intricate old English tapestries thick with raised patterns depicting strange flowers, unusual birds, and odd human figures—all of which would appear truly bizarre in the pale glow of moonlight. I asked, \"Do the servants sleep in these rooms?\" \"No,\" she replied, \"they have smaller rooms at the back. No one ever sleeps here. One could almost say that if Thornfield Hall had a ghost, this would be its spot.\" \"I agree,\" I said. \"So, you don't have a ghost?\" Mrs. Fairfax smiled and answered, \"None that I've ever heard of.\" \"No old stories or legends about one?\" I inquired. \"I don't believe so,\" she said. \"Although, it is said the Rochesters were quite a turbulent family historically. Perhaps that's why they now rest peacefully in their graves.\" \"Yes,\" I murmured, quoting, \"'after life's fitful fever they sleep well.'\" Seeing her start to move, I asked, \"Where are you going now, Mrs. Fairfax?\" \"Up to the leads,\" she replied. \"Would you like to come and see the view?\" I continued to follow, ascending a very narrow staircase to the attics, then up a ladder and through a trap-door onto the roof of the hall. I was now level with the crow colony and could see into their nests. Leaning over the battlements, looking far down, I saw the grounds spread out below like a map: the bright, smooth lawn neatly surrounding the grey base of the mansion; the vast, park-like field dotted with old trees; the dark, withered wood, bisected by a clearly overgrown path, greener with moss than with leaves; the church at the entrance, the road, and the calm hills, all bathed in the autumn sunlight. The horizon was marked by a pleasant sky, blue with swirls of pearly white clouds. Nothing in the scene was remarkable, but it was all lovely. When I turned away from the view and came back through the trap-door, it was difficult to see my way down the ladder. The attic felt utterly dark compared to the bright blue sky I had been looking up at and the sunlit landscape of woods, fields, and green hills, with the hall at its center, which I had been happily gazing at. Mrs. Fairfax paused briefly to secure the trap-door. By feeling my way, I found the exit from the attic and began descending the narrow garret staircase. I lingered in the long passage it led to, which ran between the front and back rooms of the third floor. It was narrow, low, and dim, with only one small window at the far end, and with its two rows of small, closed black doors, it looked like a corridor in some villain's castle. As I walked softly along, I heard a sound I least expected in such a quiet place: a laugh. It was a strange laugh; clear, deliberate, and without humor. I stopped. The sound stopped for just a moment, then started again, louder this time, as it had been distinct but very soft before. It ended in a noisy burst that seemed to echo in every empty room, though it came from just one spot, and I could have identified the door it came from. \"Mrs. Fairfax!\" I called out, hearing her descending the main staircase. \"Did you hear that loud laugh? Who is it?\" \"Likely one of the servants,\" she answered. \"Perhaps Grace Poole.\" \"Did you hear it?\" I asked again. \"Yes, clearly,\" she replied. \"I often hear her. She sews in one of these rooms. Sometimes Leah is with her; they can be quite noisy together.\" The laugh was repeated in its quiet, measured tone, finishing with a strange murmur. \"Grace!\" exclaimed Mrs. Fairfax. I honestly didn't expect anyone named Grace to answer, because the laugh sounded as dreadful and unnatural as any I'd ever heard. If it hadn't been the middle of the day, and if there had been any hint of ghostliness accompanying the strange sound, and if the setting and time hadn't made fear seem unlikely, I would have felt superstitious dread. However, the event soon showed me I was foolish to feel even surprised. The nearest door opened, and a servant came out—a woman in her late thirties, sturdily built and stocky, with red hair and a harsh, plain face. It was hard to imagine a less romantic or ghostly sight. \"Too much noise, Grace,\" Mrs. Fairfax said. \"Remember the instructions!\" Grace curtsied without speaking and went back inside. \"She is someone we employ for sewing and helping Leah with her housemaid duties,\" the widow explained. \"She's not perfect in all respects, but she manages well enough. By the way, how did you get on with your new pupil this morning?\" The conversation, having shifted to Adèle, continued until we reached the bright and cheerful area downstairs. Adèle ran to meet us in the hall, calling out in French, \"Mesdames, dinner is served!\" adding, \"I am very hungry!\" We found dinner ready and waiting for us in Mrs. Fairfax's room.",
          "paraphrase_gpt-4.1-2025-04-14": "After we left the dining room, Mrs. Fairfax suggested giving me a tour of the rest of the house, and I followed her both upstairs and downstairs, admiring the neat and attractive arrangements. The large front bedrooms struck me as particularly splendid, and even some of the smaller, darker rooms on the third floor were fascinating due to their old-fashioned atmosphere. Furniture that used to be in the main rooms on lower floors had been moved upstairs over the years, reflecting changing styles. The dim light coming through the small windows revealed beds a century old, oak and walnut chests ornately carved with palm branches and cherubs, tall narrow chairs, and very old stools covered in faded embroidery worked by people long gone. These objects made the third story of Thornfield Hall feel like a place preserved from the past, a sanctuary of memories. I enjoyed the peacefulness, shadowy light, and uniqueness during the day, but would not want to sleep at night in one of those old, heavy beds—some enclosed behind oak panels, others draped with thickly embroidered hangings depicting odd flowers, birds, and people, all of which would look quite eerie in moonlight.\n\nI asked if the servants slept in these rooms, and Mrs. Fairfax said no; they used smaller rooms at the back, and no one ever slept in these old chambers. She even joked that if Thornfield Hall had a ghost, it would likely haunt this part of the house. When I asked if there were any ghost stories or legends, Mrs. Fairfax replied that none she knew of. Although the Rochester family had a reputation for being fiery, perhaps that was why their ancestors now rested peacefully.\n\nMrs. Fairfax then offered to show me the rooftop view, and I followed her up a narrow staircase into the attic, up a ladder, and through a trapdoor to the roof. From there, I could see the tops of the crows’ nests and survey the grounds—lawns hugging the mansion, fields with ancient trees, a mossy path winding through faded woods, the church, the road, tranquil hills, and the blue sky streaked with white. Nothing about the scene was especially remarkable, but it was all lovely. Climbing back down, I found the attic much darker by comparison with the bright outdoors. After Mrs. Fairfax closed the trapdoor, I groped my way along the passage on the third floor, a narrow corridor separating the front and back rooms, with small black doors on both sides—like a passage out of a fairy tale.\n\nAs I walked softly in this stillness, I was startled to hear a strange, mirthless laugh echo from one of the rooms. It grew louder and more pronounced, then faded with a final murmur. I called to Mrs. Fairfax, who was coming down the main stairs, and asked if she had heard it—she said it was probably one of the servants, maybe Grace Poole, who often sewed there with Leah, and that they could be noisy. The odd laugh sounded again, and Mrs. Fairfax called out for Grace. I was surprised to see, rather than a ghostly figure, a robust, plain-faced woman with red hair emerge from the room. Mrs. Fairfax mildly reprimanded her for the noise and explained to me that Grace assisted with sewing and housekeeping; she wasn't without faults, but managed her work well enough. \n\nThe conversation then shifted to my new pupil Adèle, and continued as we returned to the bright lower floors. Adèle ran to greet us eagerly, and we found dinner ready and waiting in Mrs. Fairfax’s room."

          "text_segment": "The promise of a smooth career, which my first calm introduction to Thornfield Hall seemed to pledge, was not belied on a longer acquaintance with the place and its inmates. Mrs. Fairfax turned out to be what she appeared, a placid-tempered, kind-natured woman, of competent education and average intelligence. My pupil was a lively child, who had been spoilt and indulged, and therefore was sometimes wayward; but as she was committed entirely to my care, and no injudicious interference from any quarter ever thwarted my plans for her improvement, she soon forgot her little freaks, and became obedient and teachable. She had no great talents, no marked traits of character, no peculiar development of feeling or taste which raised her one inch above the ordinary level of childhood; but neither had she any deficiency or vice which sunk her below it. She made reasonable progress, entertained for me a vivacious, though perhaps not very profound, affection; and by her simplicity, gay prattle, and efforts to please, inspired me, in return, with a degree of attachment sufficient to make us both content in each other’s society.\nThis, par parenthèse, will be thought cool language by persons who entertain solemn doctrines about the angelic nature of children, and the duty of those charged with their education to conceive for them an idolatrous devotion: but I am not writing to flatter parental egotism, to echo cant, or prop up humbug; I am merely telling the truth. I felt a conscientious solicitude for Adèle’s welfare and progress, and a quiet liking for her little self: just as I cherished towards Mrs. Fairfax a thankfulness for her kindness, and a pleasure in her society proportionate to the tranquil regard she had for me, and the moderation of her mind and character.\nAnybody may blame me who likes, when I add further, that, now and then, when I took a walk by myself in the grounds; when I went down to the gates and looked through them along the road; or when, while Adèle played with her nurse, and Mrs. Fairfax made jellies in the storeroom, I climbed the three staircases, raised the trap-door of the attic, and having reached the leads, looked out afar over sequestered field and hill, and along dim sky-line—that then I longed for a power of vision which might overpass that limit; which might reach the busy world, towns, regions full of life I had heard of but never seen—that then I desired more of practical experience than I possessed; more of intercourse with my kind, of acquaintance with variety of character, than was here within my reach. I valued what was good in Mrs. Fairfax, and what was good in Adèle; but I believed in the existence of other and more vivid kinds of goodness, and what I believed in I wished to behold.\nWho blames me? Many, no doubt; and I shall be called discontented. I could not help it: the restlessness was in my nature; it agitated me to pain sometimes. Then my sole relief was to walk along the corridor of the third storey, backwards and forwards, safe in the silence and solitude of the spot, and allow my mind’s eye to dwell on whatever bright visions rose before it—and, certainly, they were many and glowing; to let my heart be heaved by the exultant movement, which, while it swelled it in trouble, expanded it with life; and, best of all, to open my inward ear to a tale that was never ended—a tale my imagination created, and narrated continuously; quickened with all of incident, life, fire, feeling, that I desired and had not in my actual existence.\nIt is in vain to say human beings ought to be satisfied with tranquillity: they must have action; and they will make it if they cannot find it. Millions are condemned to a stiller doom than mine, and millions are in silent revolt against their lot. Nobody knows how many rebellions besides political rebellions ferment in the masses of life which people earth. Women are supposed to be very calm generally: but women feel just as men feel; they need exercise for their faculties, and a field for their efforts, as much as their brothers do; they suffer from too rigid a restraint, too absolute a stagnation, precisely as men would suffer; and it is narrow-minded in their more privileged fellow-creatures to say that they ought to confine themselves to making puddings and knitting stockings, to playing on the piano and embroidering bags. It is thoughtless to condemn them, or laugh at them, if they seek to do more or learn more than custom has pronounced necessary for their sex.",
          "paraphrase_gemini-2.5-flash-preview-04-17": "The initially calm atmosphere upon my arrival at Thornfield Hall suggested a peaceful time ahead, and this expectation held true as I became more familiar with the place and its residents. Mrs. Fairfax proved to be exactly as she first appeared – a woman of calm disposition, kind nature, reasonable education, and average intelligence. My student was an energetic child who had been spoiled and indulged, making her sometimes unpredictable. However, since her upbringing was entirely my responsibility, and no ill-advised interference ever undermined my plans for her development, she quickly stopped her little outbursts and became compliant and easy to teach. She lacked exceptional talents, distinct personality traits, or any particular depth of feeling or taste that would distinguish her from an average child; equally, she had no significant faults or weaknesses that would place her below the norm. She made satisfactory progress, developed a lively, though perhaps not deeply felt, affection for me, and through her straightforwardness, cheerful chatter, and attempts to please, she inspired in me enough affection to ensure we were both content in each other’s company. It might be considered unsentimental by those who hold strong beliefs about children being angelic and that their educators should have an almost worshipful devotion. But I am not trying to flatter parents, repeat clichés, or support pretense; I am simply stating the facts. I felt a conscientious concern for Adèle’s well-being and development and a quiet fondness for the child herself. Similarly, my gratitude towards Mrs. Fairfax for her kindness and my enjoyment of her company were proportional to her calm regard for me and her sensible, moderate nature. Anyone can criticize me if they wish when I add that, sometimes, during a solitary walk in the grounds, or when I went down to the gates and looked along the road, or when, while Adèle played with her nurse and Mrs. Fairfax was making jellies, I would climb the three flights of stairs, open the attic trap-door, and step out onto the roof. From there, looking out over quiet fields and hills, and towards the distant horizon, I would intensely desire a broader perspective – a perspective that could go beyond these limits, reaching the bustling world, towns, and lively areas I had heard of but never seen. At such times, I craved more practical experience and more interaction with diverse people than was available to me here. I appreciated the good qualities in Mrs. Fairfax and Adèle, but I was convinced that other, more vibrant forms of goodness existed elsewhere, and what I believed in, I longed to witness. Who will criticize me? Many, no doubt, and I will be labeled discontented. I could not help it; this restlessness was inherent in my character, sometimes causing me distress. My only relief then was to walk back and forth along the third-floor corridor, secure in its silence and solitude, and let my imagination focus on any bright visions that appeared – and there were certainly many vivid ones. I let my heart be stirred by the powerful internal motion that, while causing unease, also filled it with vitality. Best of all, I would listen inwardly to an endless story, one created and continuously narrated by my imagination, filled with all the events, life, passion, and feeling that I desired but lacked in my actual existence. It is futile to claim that humans should be satisfied with mere peace; they require activity, and they will create it if they cannot find it. Millions face lives quieter than mine, and millions silently rebel against their circumstances. The sheer number of unspoken rebellions, besides political ones, brewing among the world's population is unknown. Women are generally thought to be very composed, but women experience feelings just as men do. They need opportunities to use their abilities and a sphere for their efforts, just like their male counterparts. They suffer from overly strict constraints and complete stagnation exactly as men would. It is narrow-minded for their more privileged peers to say they should restrict themselves to domestic tasks like cooking and knitting, or quiet hobbies like playing the piano and embroidering. It is thoughtless to condemn or ridicule them if they seek to do or learn more than tradition deems suitable for their gender.",
          "paraphrase_gpt-4.1-2025-04-14": "The expectation that my time at Thornfield Hall would be peaceful, as suggested by my calm arrival, turned out to be true as I got to know the place and the people there. Mrs. Fairfax proved to be exactly as she first appeared: a gentle and kind woman with a solid education and ordinary intelligence. Adèle, my student, was an energetic girl, somewhat spoiled and prone to mischief as a result, but since I was in sole charge of her education with no one interfering unhelpfully, she quickly became obedient and willing to learn. She was not particularly gifted or remarkable, but neither was she flawed or badly behaved. She made acceptable progress in her studies, grew fond of me in a lively, if not deep, way, and her cheerful talk and efforts to please made me grow attached to her so that we were both content with each other’s company.\n\nI mention this in passing, acknowledging that some might find my manner of speaking cold, especially those who think of children as angels and expect educators to almost worship them. But I am not interested in flattering such ideals; I only want to speak the truth. I felt a genuine responsibility for Adèle’s wellbeing and development, and a quiet affection for her. Similarly, I appreciated Mrs. Fairfax’s kindness towards me and enjoyed her company in return for her calm and moderate character.\n\nIf anyone wishes to criticize me, let them do so when I add that at times, as I walked alone on the grounds, or gazed out over the countryside, or wandered up to the roof to look beyond the fields to the distant horizon, I longed to see beyond my immediate world—to witness the busy life of towns and places I had only heard about. I wished for more real-life experience and more interactions with different people than I could have at Thornfield. While I valued the good qualities of both Mrs. Fairfax and Adèle, I believed there must be more vibrant virtues in the world that I wanted to see for myself.\n\nWho will criticize me? Many, perhaps—they might call me discontented. I couldn’t help it. The feeling of restlessness was part of my nature, sometimes intense enough to hurt. My only comfort was to wander the quiet upper corridors and let my imagination fill the void with vivid stories and dreams that made up for what I lacked in real life.\n\nIt is pointless to insist people should be content with a quiet existence—they crave action, and will create it if they cannot find it. Many live in quieter circumstances than I did, and many quietly rebel against their fate. Countless rebellions, not just political ones, are brewing among the masses. Women are often assumed to be naturally calm, but they feel as deeply as men do, needing opportunities to use their abilities and meaningful pursuits just as much. When kept in strict confinement or left idle, women suffer as men would, and it is narrow-minded for more privileged people to insist women should stick to traditional domestic tasks. It is unfair to scorn or ridicule women who strive to do or learn more than custom expects."

One afternoon in January, Mrs. Fairfax had begged a holiday for Adèle, because she had a cold; and, as Adèle seconded the request with an ardour that reminded me how precious occasional holidays had been to me in my own childhood, I accorded it, deeming that I did well in showing pliability on the point. It was a fine, calm day, though very cold; I was tired of sitting still in the library through a whole long morning: Mrs. Fairfax had just written a letter which was waiting to be posted, so I put on my bonnet and cloak and volunteered to carry it to Hay; the distance, two miles, would be a pleasant winter afternoon walk. Having seen Adèle comfortably seated in her little chair by Mrs. Fairfax’s parlour fireside, and given her her best wax doll (which I usually kept enveloped in silver paper in a drawer) to play with, and a story-book for change of amusement; and having replied to her “Revenez bientôt, ma bonne amie, ma chère Mdlle. Jeannette,” with a kiss, I set out.\nThe ground was hard, the air was still, my road was lonely; I walked fast till I got warm, and then I walked slowly to enjoy and analyse the species of pleasure brooding for me in the hour and situation. It was three o’clock; the church bell tolled as I passed under the belfry: the charm of the hour lay in its approaching dimness, in the low-gliding and pale-beaming sun. I was a mile from Thornfield, in a lane noted for wild roses in summer, for nuts and blackberries in autumn, and even now possessing a few coral treasures in hips and haws, but whose best winter delight lay in its utter solitude and leafless repose. If a breath of air stirred, it made no sound here; for there was not a holly, not an evergreen to rustle, and the stripped hawthorn and hazel bushes were as still as the white, worn stones which causewayed the middle of the path. Far and wide, on each side, there were only fields, where no cattle now browsed; and the little brown birds, which stirred occasionally in the hedge, looked like single russet leaves that had forgotten to drop.\nThis lane inclined up-hill all the way to Hay; having reached the middle, I sat down on a stile which led thence into a field. Gathering my mantle about me, and sheltering my hands in my muff, I did not feel the cold, though it froze keenly; as was attested by a sheet of ice covering the causeway, where a little brooklet, now congealed, had overflowed after a rapid thaw some days since. From my seat I could look down on Thornfield: the grey and battlemented hall was the principal object in the vale below me; its woods and dark rookery rose against the west. I lingered till the sun went down amongst the trees, and sank crimson and clear behind them. I then turned eastward.",

One afternoon in January, Mrs. Fairfax asked for a day off for Adèle because she had a cold. Seeing Adèle support this request with an eagerness that reminded me how precious rare holidays were in my own childhood, I agreed, believing it was good to demonstrate flexibility on this matter. The day was pleasant and calm, although quite cold. I was tired of remaining seated in the library all morning. Mrs. Fairfax had just finished writing a letter that needed mailing, so I put on my hat and cloak and volunteered to take it to Hay; the two-mile distance seemed like it would be a pleasant walk for a winter afternoon. After making sure Adèle was comfortable by the fire in Mrs. Fairfax’s living room, giving her her finest wax doll (which I usually kept wrapped in tissue paper in a drawer) to play with and a storybook for a change of activity, and responding to her plea, 'Come back soon, my good friend, my dear Miss Jeannette,' with a kiss, I departed. The ground was frozen solid, the air was motionless, and my path was deserted. I walked quickly until I felt warm, then slowed down to appreciate and examine the particular kind of happiness that the time and place offered me. It was three o’clock; the church bell rang out as I passed beneath the bell tower. The allure of the hour lay in the encroaching twilight and the low, pale sunlight. I was a mile from Thornfield, on a lane known for wild roses in summer, nuts and berries in autumn, and even now holding a few red treasures like rosehips and hawthorn berries. However, its greatest winter charm was its complete isolation and the stillness of its bare branches. If any breeze stirred, it made no noise here, as there were no holly or other evergreens to rustle, and the stripped hawthorn and hazel bushes were as silent as the white, worn stones forming the path's middle. On either side, stretching far and wide, were only fields where no livestock grazed. The small brown birds occasionally moving in the hedge looked like solitary reddish-brown leaves that had failed to fall. This lane ascended towards Hay. Reaching the halfway point, I sat on a stile leading into a field. Drawing my cloak tighter around me and keeping my hands in my muff, I did not feel the cold, although the frost was sharp, as shown by a sheet of ice covering the path where a small stream, now frozen solid, had overflowed days earlier after a quick thaw. From where I sat, I could look down at Thornfield. The grey hall with its battlements was the main sight in the valley below me; its woods and dark collection of rooks stood out against the western sky. I stayed until the sun descended among the trees, setting red and clear behind them. Then, I turned eastward.",

Adèle enthusiastically supported the idea, which reminded me how much I cherished occasional holidays as a child, so I agreed, thinking it good to be flexible about such things. It was a beautiful, calm, but very cold day, and after spending the entire morning sitting in the library, I felt restless. Mrs. Fairfax had just finished writing a letter that needed to be mailed, so I put on my bonnet and cloak and offered to take it to Hay myself—a walk of about two miles, which seemed like a pleasant way to spend a winter afternoon. Making sure Adèle was settled comfortably by the fireside in Mrs. Fairfax’s sitting room, with her best wax doll (normally wrapped in silver paper in a drawer) and a storybook to keep her amused, and after answering her fond farewell—\"Come back soon, my good friend, dear Mademoiselle Jeannette\"—with a kiss, I set off. \n\nThe ground was hard with frost, the air completely still, and I was alone on the road. I walked quickly at first to warm myself, then slowed down to enjoy and reflect on the particular quiet pleasure the time and place offered me. It was three o’clock, and as I passed under the church belfry, the bell tolled; the scene was especially appealing because of the fading daylight and the low, pale sun moving across the sky. I was a mile from Thornfield, walking along a lane known in summer for wild roses, in autumn for nuts and blackberries, and even now adorned with bright red hips and haws. Its greatest winter charm was its solitude and the stillness of the bare trees. Even if there was a breeze, nothing rustled, since there were no evergreens, and the hawthorn and hazel bushes were as quiet as the pale, worn stones that paved the middle of the path.

Wrapping my cloak around me and tucking my hands into a muff, I didn’t feel the cold despite the sharp frost, as shown by a sheet of ice over the path where a small stream had spilled and frozen after a recent thaw. From my seat I could see Thornfield Hall below, its grey, battlemented structure standing out in the valley, with its woods and dark rookery rising against the western sky.

My ear, too, felt the flow of currents; in what dales and depths I could not tell: but there were many hills beyond Hay, and doubtless many becks threading their passes. That evening calm betrayed alike the tinkle of the nearest streams, the sough of the most remote.\nA rude noise broke on these fine ripplings and whisperings, at once so far away and so clear: a positive tramp, tramp, a metallic clatter, which effaced the soft wave-wanderings; as, in a picture, the solid mass of a crag, or the rough boles of a great oak, drawn in dark and strong on the foreground, efface the aërial distance of azure hill, sunny horizon, and blended clouds where tint melts into tint.\nThe din was on the causeway: a horse was coming; the windings of the lane yet hid it, but it approached.

The town, partially concealed by trees, emitted thin trails of blue smoke from its few chimneys. Although it was still a mile away, the profound quiet allowed me to clearly distinguish the faint sounds of life emanating from it. My ears also picked up the sound of flowing water; I couldn't pinpoint the exact valleys or depths, but I knew there were many hills beyond Hay, likely crisscrossed by numerous streams. The stillness of the evening made both the nearby streams' tinkle and the distant ones' soft murmur audible. A harsh sound abruptly interrupted these delicate, clear whisperings, so distinct yet so remote. It was a definite tramping and metallic clatter, which overwhelmed the soft, flowing sounds, much like how, in a painting, a solid rock or the rugged trunks of large oak trees, depicted darkly and strongly in the foreground, erase the airy distance of blue hills, sunlit horizons, and blended clouds where colours subtly transition. The commotion was on the paved road; a horse was approaching. Although hidden by the winding lane, it was getting closer. I was just about to leave the stile, but as the path was narrow, I remained seated to let it pass. At that age, I was young, and my mind was filled with all sorts of fantasies, both cheerful and somber. Nursery rhymes and other old stories were part of this mental jumble, and when they resurfaced, my maturing mind added a strength and clarity to them that childhood could never provide. As this horse drew nearer and I watched for it to emerge from the twilight, I recalled some of Bessie’s stories, which featured a North-of-England spirit called a 'Gytrash.'

Though Hay was still a mile away, the silence was so complete that its faint signs of life reached my ears. I could also sense the movement of water in unseen valleys and depths beyond Hay, where many hills and likely many small streams wound their way. The peace of the evening made audible even the tinkling of the closest brooks and the faint sighs of the most distant.\n\nSuddenly, a harsh noise disrupted these delicate sounds, both distant and clear: a steady tramping and metallic clattering that overwhelmed the gentle murmurs.

It was exactly one form of Bessie’s Gytrash—a lion-like creature with long hair and a huge head: it passed me, however, quietly enough; not staying to look up, with strange pretercanine eyes, in my face, as I half expected it would. The horse followed,—a tall steed, and on its back a rider. The man, the human being, broke the spell at once. Nothing ever rode the Gytrash: it was always alone; and goblins, to my notions, though they might tenant the dumb carcasses of beasts, could scarce covet shelter in the commonplace human form. No Gytrash was this,—only a traveller taking the short cut to Millcote. He passed, and I went on; a few steps, and I turned: a sliding sound and an exclamation of “What the deuce is to do now?” and a clattering tumble, arrested my attention. Man and horse were down; they had slipped on the sheet of ice which glazed the causeway. The dog came bounding back, and seeing his master in a predicament, and hearing the horse groan, barked till the evening hills echoed the sound, which was deep in proportion to his magnitude. He snuffed round the prostrate group, and then he ran up to me; it was all he could do,—there was no other help at hand to summon. I obeyed him, and walked down to the traveller, by this time struggling himself free of his steed. His efforts were so vigorous, I thought he could not be much hurt; but I asked him the question—\n“Are you injured, sir?”\nI think he was swearing, but am not certain; however, he was pronouncing some formula which prevented him from replying to me directly.\n“Can I do anything?” I asked again.",
          "paraphrase_gemini-2.5-flash-preview-04-17": "Although not yet visible, I could tell it was close by the sound of footsteps. Suddenly, in addition to the rhythmic tread, I heard something moving quickly under the hedge. A large dog, strikingly black and white against the trees, glided out near the hazel bushes. It looked exactly like the description of a 'Gytrash' Bessie used to tell—a beast resembling a lion with shaggy fur and a massive head. Yet, it passed me without incident, not pausing to fix me with eerie, unnatural eyes as I half-expected it might. Following the dog was a tall horse carrying a rider. The sight of the human instantly broke my fantastical notion. A Gytrash, in my understanding, was always solitary; while spirits might inhabit animals, they wouldn't seek refuge in an ordinary human form. So, this wasn't a Gytrash after all, but simply a traveler using the shortcut towards Millcote. He continued on, and I resumed my walk. After only a few steps, I heard a sliding noise, a cry of 'What the deuce is to do now?', and a loud clatter behind me, which made me stop. The man and his horse had fallen, having slipped on the sheet of ice covering the path. The dog raced back and, seeing his master in trouble and hearing the horse groan, barked so loudly that the sound, deep from his large size, echoed across the evening hills. He sniffed around the fallen pair, then came running to me—there was no one else around to call for help. I followed his lead and went back to the traveler, who was by then struggling to free himself from the horse. His movements were so strong that I doubted he was seriously injured, but I asked him, 'Are you hurt, sir?' I believe he was cursing, though I'm not certain. At any rate, he was saying something that prevented him from answering me right away. 'Can I do anything?' I repeated.",

Suddenly, a large black and white dog slipped quietly past the hazel bushes, its coloring making it stand out against the trees. It looked just like the creature Bessie had told stories about—a lion-like animal with long hair and a big head. However, it passed by me calmly, not even glancing at me with strange, almost supernatural eyes as I half expected. Then came the horse—a tall animal ridden by a man. The sight of a human broke any sense of enchantment at once. The Gytrash of legend was always alone; nothing ever rode it. Spirits, I believed, might inhabit animal forms, but they wouldn't care to take on an ordinary human body. So, this wasn't some mythical beast—just a traveler taking a shortcut to Millcote. He passed, and I kept walking. After a few steps, I heard a sliding noise, an exclamation—“What the deuce is to do now?”—and a crashing fall that made me stop. Both man and horse had slipped on the icy path and fallen. The dog ran back, and upon hearing his master's distress and the horse's groan, began barking loudly, the sound echoing through the hills due to his large size. Sniffing around the fallen man and horse, the dog then ran up to me, as there was no one else around to help. I followed his lead and went to the traveler, who by then was struggling to free himself from his horse. His actions seemed strong, so I assumed he wasn't badly hurt, but I still asked, “Are you injured, sir?” I think he was swearing, though I wasn't sure; in any case, he was muttering something and didn't answer immediately.

This was finally fortunate; the horse was re-established, and the dog was silenced with a “Down, Pilot!” The traveller now, stooping, felt his foot and leg, as if trying whether they were sound; apparently something ailed them, for he halted to the stile whence I had just risen, and sat down.\nI was in the mood for being useful, or at least officious, I think, for I now drew near him again.\n“If you are hurt, and want help, sir, I can fetch some one either from Thornfield Hall or from Hay.”\n“Thank you: I shall do: I have no broken bones,—only a sprain;” and again he stood up and tried his foot, but the result extorted an involuntary “Ugh!”\nSomething of daylight still lingered, and the moon was waxing bright: I could see him plainly. His figure was enveloped in a riding cloak, fur collared and steel clasped; its details were not apparent, but I traced the general points of middle height and considerable breadth of chest. He had a dark face, with stern features and a heavy brow; his eyes and gathered eyebrows looked ireful and thwarted just now; he was past youth, but had not reached middle-age; perhaps he might be thirty-five. I felt no fear of him, and but little shyness. Had he been a handsome, heroic-looking young gentleman, I should not have dared to stand thus questioning him against his will, and offering my services unasked. I had hardly ever seen a handsome youth; never in my life spoken to one. I had a theoretical reverence and homage for beauty, elegance, gallantry, fascination; but had I met those qualities incarnate in masculine shape, I should have known instinctively that they neither had nor could have sympathy with anything in me, and should have shunned them as one would fire, lightning, or anything else that is bright but antipathetic.\nIf even this stranger had smiled and been good-humoured to me when I addressed him; if he had put off my offer of assistance gaily and with thanks, I should have gone on my way and not felt any vocation to renew inquiries: but the frown, the roughness of the traveller, set me at my ease: I retained my station when he waved to me to go, and announced—\n“I cannot think of leaving you, sir, at so late an hour, in this solitary lane, till I see you are fit to mount your horse.”\nHe looked at me when I said this; he had hardly turned his eyes in my direction before.\n“I should think you ought to be at home yourself,” said he, “if you have a home in this neighbourhood: where do you come from?”\n“From just below; and I am not at all afraid of being out late when it is moonlight: I will run over to Hay for you with pleasure, if you wish it: indeed, I am going there to post a letter.”\n“You live just below—do you mean at that house with the battlements?” pointing to Thornfield Hall, on which the moon cast a hoary gleam, bringing it out distinct and pale from the woods that, by contrast with the western sky, now seemed one mass of shadow.\n“Yes, sir.”\n“Whose house is it?”\n“Mr. Rochester’s.”\n“Do you know Mr. Rochester?”\n“No, I have never seen him.”\n“He is not resident, then?”\n“No.”\n“Can you tell me where he is?”\n“I cannot.”\n“You are not a servant at the hall, of course. You are—” He stopped, ran his eye over my dress, which, as usual, was quite simple: a black merino cloak, a black beaver bonnet; neither of them half fine enough for a lady’s-maid. He seemed puzzled to decide what I was; I helped him.\n“I am the governess.”\n“Ah, the governess!” he repeated; “deuce take me, if I had not forgotten! The governess!” and again my raiment underwent scrutiny.",
          "paraphrase_gemini-2.5-flash-preview-04-17": "“Move to one side,” he instructed as he got back on his feet, first kneeling then standing. I did as he asked, and then the horse began a chaotic struggle of pushing, stomping, and clanging, accompanied by barking and howling that sent me back several yards. Still, I stayed to witness what happened. It ended well; the horse was upright again, and the dog was silenced with a command, “Down, Pilot!” The traveler then bent to feel his foot and leg, as if checking for soundness; they seemed injured, as he limped to the low wall I had been sitting on and sat down. Feeling perhaps helpful, or maybe just intrusive, I approached him again. “If you’re hurt and need help, sir, I can get someone from either Thornfield Hall or Hay.” “Thank you; I’ll manage. No broken bones—just a sprain,” he replied, standing again to test his foot, but the attempt elicited an involuntary groan, “Ugh!” Some daylight lingered, and the moon was growing bright, allowing me to see him clearly. He was wrapped in a riding cloak with a fur collar and steel clasps; I couldn’t see the fine details, but I could make out his general build, medium height and broad chest. He had a dark, stern face with a heavy brow; his eyes and drawn-together eyebrows looked angry and thwarted just then; he was past his youth but hadn't reached middle age, perhaps around thirty-five. I felt no fear of him and little shyness. Had he been a handsome, heroic-looking young man, I wouldn't have dared to stand there questioning him against his will or offering my help unasked. I had rarely seen a handsome youth and never spoken to one. I admired beauty, elegance, charm, and allure in theory, but I knew instinctively that if I met these qualities in a man, they would not understand or relate to me, and I would avoid them like fire, lightning, or anything else bright but off-putting. If this stranger had smiled and been pleasant when I spoke, or politely and thankfully declined my offer, I would have gone on my way without feeling compelled to ask further. But his frown and rough manner made me feel at ease. I stayed put when he motioned for me to leave and declared, “Sir, I can’t bring myself to leave you alone in this isolated lane so late until I’m sure you’re able to ride your horse.” He looked at me when I said this; he hadn’t really turned his eyes towards me before. “I think you should be at home yourself,” he said, “if you live in this area. Where are you from?” “From just below; and I’m not at all afraid of being out late with the moonlight. I’ll gladly run over to Hay for you if you wish; in fact, I’m going there anyway to post a letter.” “You live just below—do you mean that house with the battlements?” he asked, pointing towards Thornfield Hall, which the moon illuminated with a pale glow, making it stand out clearly from the woods that, in contrast to the western sky, now appeared as a mass of shadow. “Yes, sir.” “Whose house is it?” “Mr. Rochester’s.” “Do you know Mr. Rochester?” “No, I have never seen him.” “He isn’t living there currently, then?” “No.” “Can you tell me where he is?” “I cannot.” “You’re not a servant at the hall, of course. You are—” He stopped, his eyes examining my simple dress: a black merino cloak, a black beaver bonnet; neither was suitable for a lady’s maid. He seemed unsure what I was; I clarified, “I am the governess.” “Ah, the governess!” he repeated; “Hang it, I’d completely forgotten! The governess!” and he examined my clothing again.",
          "paraphrase_gpt-4.1-2025-04-14": "He told me to move aside, which I did as he got up from the ground. There was then a noisy commotion: heavy movement, the clatter of hooves, and loud barking, which forced me to retreat a few paces, but I didn't leave completely—I wanted to see what would happen. Eventually, the horse got back to its feet, and the dog calmed down after being scolded. The traveler bent down to check his foot and leg, clearly in discomfort, as he limped over to the stile I had just come from and sat down. \n\nFeeling eager to be of assistance—or at least to do something helpful—I went over to him again. I offered to fetch aid from either Thornfield Hall or the nearby town of Hay if he needed help. He thanked me but declined, saying it was only a sprain, no broken bones. He got to his feet again and tested his injured foot, but he couldn't hide a pained reaction. \n\nWith some daylight left and the moon getting brighter, I could see him quite well. He was wearing a riding cloak with a fur collar and metal clasp. He appeared to be of average height and broad-shouldered. His face was dark, his features stern, and he had thick eyebrows drawn together in irritation. He clearly wasn't young anymore, but not yet middle-aged—about thirty-five, I guessed. I felt neither afraid nor particularly shy around him. Had he been a very handsome and polished young man, I probably wouldn't have dared speak to him so freely or offer help; I admired such qualities from afar, but sensed instinctively that such people could never relate to me, and I would've avoided them. \n\nIf this stranger had been cheerful or kind in his response, I would have left him alone. But his sternness instead made me feel comfortable enough to stay. Even when he motioned for me to go, I told him that I couldn't leave him alone in such a lonely spot at night until I knew he could ride his horse again. This, I noticed, was the first time he really looked at me. \n\nHe suggested I ought to be at home if I lived nearby, and asked where I came from. I explained I lived just down the road and that I didn't mind being out late at night; I was, in fact, headed to Hay to mail a letter, and could fetch help if he needed. \n\nHe gestured towards Thornfield Hall and asked if I lived there. I confirmed, and he asked whose house it was—Mr. Rochester's. When he asked if I knew Mr. Rochester, I told him I had never met him. Then he asked if Mr. Rochester lived there; I said he did not. He asked where Mr. Rochester was; I couldn’t say. Then, studying my plain clothing, he tried to guess my position and assumed I wasn’t a servant. I clarified for him that I was the governess. At this, he exclaimed about forgetting there was a governess, and examined my appearance again."

The incident had occurred and was gone for me: it was an incident of no moment, no romance, no interest in a sense; yet it marked with change one single hour of a monotonous life. My help had been needed and claimed; I had given it: I was pleased to have done something; trivial, transitory though the deed was, it was yet an active thing, and I was weary of an existence all passive. The new face, too, was like a new picture introduced to the gallery of memory; and it was dissimilar to all the others hanging there: firstly, because it was masculine; and, secondly, because it was dark, strong, and stern. I had it still before me when I entered Hay, and slipped the letter into the post-office; I saw it as I walked fast down-hill all the way home. When I came to the stile, I stopped a minute, looked round and listened, with an idea that a horse’s hoofs might ring on the causeway again, and that a rider in a cloak, and a Gytrash-like Newfoundland dog, might be again apparent: I saw only the hedge and a pollard willow before me, rising up still and straight to meet the moonbeams; I heard only the faintest waft of wind roaming fitful among the trees round Thornfield, a mile distant; and when I glanced down in the direction of the murmur, my eye, traversing the hall-front, caught a light kindling in a window: it reminded me that I was late, and I hurried on.\nI did not like re-entering Thornfield. To pass its threshold was to return to stagnation; to cross the silent hall, to ascend the darksome staircase, to seek my own lonely little room, and then to meet tranquil Mrs. Fairfax, and spend the long winter evening with her, and her only, was to quell wholly the faint excitement wakened by my walk,—to slip again over my faculties the viewless fetters of an uniform and too still existence; of an existence whose very privileges of security and ease I was becoming incapable of appreciating. What good it would have done me at that time to have been tossed in the storms of an uncertain struggling life, and to have been taught by rough and bitter experience to long for the calm amidst which I now repined! Yes, just as much good as it would do a man tired of sitting still in a “too easy chair” to take a long walk: and just as natural was the wish to stir, under my circumstances, as it would be under his.\nI lingered at the gates; I lingered on the lawn; I paced backwards and forwards on the pavement; the shutters of the glass door were closed; I could not see into the interior; and both my eyes and spirit seemed drawn from the gloomy house—from the grey hollow filled with rayless cells, as it appeared to me—to that sky expanded before me,—a blue sea absolved from taint of cloud; the moon ascending it in solemn march; her orb seeming to look up as she left the hill-tops, from behind which she had come, far and farther below her, and aspired to the zenith, midnight dark in its fathomless depth and measureless distance; and for those trembling stars that followed her course; they made my heart tremble, my veins glow when I viewed them. Little things recall us to earth; the clock struck in the hall; that sufficed; I turned from moon and stars, opened a side-door, and went in.",

For me, the event was finished and gone; in a way, it wasn't a major incident, had no romance, and wasn't particularly interesting. Yet, it marked a change in one single hour of my monotonous life. My assistance was needed and requested; I provided it. I was pleased to have accomplished something; even though the act was minor and brief, it was still an active deed, and I was tired of an entirely passive existence. The new face, too, was like a fresh image added to my collection of memories, and it was unlike any other picture hanging there. Firstly, because it was a man's face, and secondly, because it was dark, strong, and serious. I still saw it in my mind when I reached Hay and dropped the letter into the post-office. I pictured it as I walked quickly downhill all the way home. When I arrived at the stile, I stopped for a moment, looked around and listened, half-expecting that a horse's hooves might sound on the path again, and that a rider in a cloak, with a large, Gytrash-like dog, might reappear. I saw only the hedge and a pollard willow in front of me, standing still and upright under the moonbeams. I heard only the faintest whisper of wind drifting irregularly among the trees around Thornfield, which was a mile distant. When I looked down towards the direction of that soft sound, my gaze, sweeping across the front of the house, spotted a light turning on in a window. It reminded me that I was late, and I hurried on.\nI didn't look forward to re-entering Thornfield. Crossing its threshold meant returning to stagnation; walking through the quiet hall, climbing the dark staircase, going to my solitary little room, and then meeting the calm Mrs. Fairfax, and spending the long winter evening only with her, meant completely suppressing the slight excitement my walk had awakened. It meant letting the invisible chains of a uniform and overly still existence settle back upon my abilities; an existence whose very advantages of security and comfort I was becoming unable to value. How beneficial it would have been for me at that time to have been tossed about in the challenges of an uncertain, struggling life, and to have learned through difficult and harsh experience to long for the calm I was now complaining about! Yes, it would have been just as good for me as a long walk would be for a man tired of sitting still in a \"too easy chair\"; and my desire to move and experience things, given my circumstances, was just as natural as his would be.\nI paused at the gates; I lingered on the lawn; I walked back and forth on the path. The shutters of the glass door were closed; I couldn't see inside. Both my eyes and my spirit seemed drawn away from the gloomy house—which appeared to me like a grey, empty space filled with dark, unlit rooms—towards the sky spread out before me. It was a blue expanse completely free of clouds, with the moon ascending it in a dignified procession. Her light seemed to look upwards as she left the hilltops she had emerged from, leaving them further and further below her, and aimed for the highest point of the sky, which was midnight dark in its immeasurable depth and vast distance. And as for those faint stars that followed her path, they made my heart tremble and my veins glow when I looked at them. Small things bring us back to reality; the clock in the hall struck. That was sufficient; I turned away from the moon and stars, opened a side door, and went in.",

The light also made visible a group gathered near the mantelpiece; I barely glimpsed them and caught a cheerful blend of voices, with Adèle’s voice among them, just as the door closed. I quickly went to Mrs. Fairfax’s room, where I found a fire burning but no candle and no Mrs. Fairfax. Instead, alone and sitting upright on the rug watching the fire seriously, was a large black and white long-haired dog, resembling the Gytrash from the lane. It looked so similar that I approached and called, ‘Pilot,’ and the dog got up, came over, and sniffed me. I petted him, and he wagged his huge tail; however, he felt like an uncanny companion to be left alone with, and I did not know where he had come from. I rang the bell, wishing for a candle and curious about this visitor. Leah answered my call."

A fire was lit in an apartment upstairs, and there I carried our books, and arranged it for the future schoolroom. I discerned in the course of the morning that Thornfield Hall was a changed place: no longer silent as a church, it echoed every hour or two to a knock at the door, or a clang of the bell; steps, too, often traversed the hall, and new voices spoke in different keys below; a rill from the outer world was flowing through it; it had a master: for my part, I liked it better.\nAdèle was not easy to teach that day; she could not apply: she kept running to the door and looking over the banisters to see if she could get a glimpse of Mr. Rochester; then she coined pretexts to go downstairs, in order, as I shrewdly suspected, to visit the library, where I knew she was not wanted; then, when I got a little angry, and made her sit still, she continued to talk incessantly of her “ami, Monsieur Edouard Fairfax de Rochester,” as she dubbed him (I had not before heard his prenomens), and to conjecture what presents he had brought her: for it appears he had intimated the night before, that when his luggage came from Millcote, there would be found amongst it a little box in whose contents she had an interest.\n“Et cela doit signifier,” said she, “qu’il y aura là dedans un cadeau pour moi, et peut-être pour vous aussi, mademoiselle. Monsieur a parlé de vous: il m’a demandé le nom de ma gouvernante, et si elle n’était pas une petite personne, assez mince et un peu pâle.

Upon descending, he immediately attended to business matters, as his agent and several tenants had arrived and were waiting to speak with him. Consequently, Adèle and I had to leave the library, as it was now needed daily to receive visitors. A fire was started in an upstairs room, where I moved our books and arranged it to become our new schoolroom. During the morning, I noticed that Thornfield Hall felt considerably altered; instead of its former quietness, it now frequently echoed with knocks at the door or the ringing of the bell every hour or two. People often walked through the hall, and new voices could be heard from downstairs. It was as if a stream from the outside world was flowing through it; the house now had a master. Personally, I preferred it this way. Adèle was difficult to teach that day; she struggled to concentrate. She repeatedly ran to the door and peered over the banisters, hoping to catch sight of Mr. Rochester. Then she invented excuses to go downstairs, which I strongly suspected were attempts to get into the library, a place I knew she shouldn't be. When I eventually became a little annoyed and insisted she remain seated, she continued talking incessantly about her 'friend, Monsieur Edouard Fairfax de Rochester,' as she nicknamed him (I had not heard his first names previously), and speculating about the gifts he might have brought her. It seems he had hinted the previous evening that when his luggage arrived from Millcote, it would contain a small box with something in it that would interest her. 'And that must mean,' she said, 'that there will be a gift for me inside, and perhaps for you too, Mademoiselle. Monsieur spoke about you: he asked me the name of my governess, and if she wasn't a small person, quite thin and a little pale. I said yes, because that's true, isn't it, Mademoiselle?'",

When he did finally appear, it was because he had business to attend to; his agent and some tenants had arrived and were waiting to meet him. As a result, Adèle and I had to leave the library, since it would now be used daily as a room to receive visitors.

Adèle was difficult to teach that day; she was distracted and unable to concentrate, continually running to the door and peering over the banisters hoping to catch sight of Mr. Rochester. She made up reasons to go downstairs—likely hoping to sneak into the library, though she was not supposed to go there. When I became a bit exasperated and made her stay put, she wouldn’t stop talking about her 'friend,' Mr. Edouard Fairfax de Rochester (the first time I’d heard his full name), and speculated about what gifts he might have brought her. Evidently, he had told her the night before that when his luggage arrived from Millcote, there would be a small box in it intended for her. \"And that must mean,\" she said, \"there will be a present for me inside, and perhaps for you too, mademoiselle.

At dark I allowed Adèle to put away books and work, and to run downstairs; for, from the comparative silence below, and from the cessation of appeals to the door-bell, I conjectured that Mr. Rochester was now at liberty. Left alone, I walked to the window; but nothing was to be seen thence: twilight and snowflakes together thickened the air, and hid the very shrubs on the lawn. I let down the curtain and went back to the fireside.\nIn the clear embers I was tracing a view, not unlike a picture I remembered to have seen of the castle of Heidelberg, on the Rhine, when Mrs. Fairfax came in, breaking up by her entrance the fiery mosaic I had been piercing together, and scattering too some heavy unwelcome thoughts that were beginning to throng on my solitude.\n“Mr. Rochester would be glad if you and your pupil would take tea with him in the drawing-room this evening,” said she: “he has been so much engaged all day that he could not ask to see you before.”\n“When is his tea-time?” I inquired.\n“Oh, at six o’clock: he keeps early hours in the country. You had better change your frock now; I will go with you and fasten it. Here is a candle.”\n“Is it necessary to change my frock?”\n“Yes, you had better: I always dress for the evening when Mr. Rochester is here.”\nThis additional ceremony seemed somewhat stately; however, I repaired to my room, and, with Mrs. Fairfax’s aid, replaced my black stuff dress by one of black silk; the best and the only additional one I had, except one of light grey, which, in my Lowood notions of the toilette, I thought too fine to be worn, except on first-rate occasions.\n“You want a brooch,” said Mrs. Fairfax. I had a single little pearl ornament which Miss Temple gave me as a parting keepsake: I put it on, and then we went downstairs. Unused as I was to strangers, it was rather a trial to appear thus formally summoned in Mr. Rochester’s presence. I let Mrs. Fairfax precede me into the dining-room, and kept in her shade as we crossed that apartment; and, passing the arch, whose curtain was now dropped, entered the elegant recess beyond.",

When it got dark, I allowed Adèle to finish her studies and chores and go downstairs. Based on the reduced noise from below and the lack of rings at the doorbell, I suspected Mr. Rochester was now free. Once I was alone, I walked to the window, but I couldn't see anything outside. The combined effect of twilight and falling snow obscured the air, hiding even the bushes on the lawn. I closed the curtain and returned to sit by the fire.\nWhile staring into the bright embers, I was picturing a scene that reminded me of a picture I'd seen of Heidelberg Castle on the Rhine. Just then, Mrs. Fairfax entered, interrupting the fiery image I was constructing and also dispersing some heavy, unwelcome thoughts that were starting to crowd my solitary mind.\nShe announced, \"Mr. Rochester would like you and your pupil to join him for tea in the drawing-room this evening. He's been so busy all day that he couldn't ask to see you sooner.\"\nI asked, \"What time is tea?\"\n\"Oh, six o’clock,\" she replied. \"He keeps early hours in the country. You should probably change your dress now. I’ll help you with it. Here’s a candle.\"\n\"Is it necessary to change my dress?\" I questioned.\n\"Yes, you really should,\" she advised. \"I always dress up for the evening when Mr. Rochester is present.\"\nThis added formality seemed rather grand. Nevertheless, I went to my room, and with Mrs. Fairfax’s help, I swapped my black woollen gown for one of black silk. It was the best and only spare dress I owned, apart from a light grey one which, according to my simple Lowood ideas of dressing, I considered too fancy for anything but very special occasions.\n\"You need a brooch,\" Mrs. Fairfax remarked. I had a small pearl pin that Miss Temple had given me as a farewell gift. I put it on, and then we headed downstairs. Not being used to company, appearing formally summoned into Mr. Rochester’s presence felt somewhat daunting. I let Mrs. Fairfax walk ahead of me into the dining-room, staying slightly behind her as we crossed it. We then passed through the arched doorway, where the curtain was now drawn, and entered the elegant space beyond.",

The weather outside was stormy and filled with snow, so we spent the afternoon inside the schoolroom. As it grew dark, I let Adèle put away her lessons and go downstairs, since things were quieter below and I guessed that Mr. Rochester was finally free from his business. When I was alone, I walked over to the window, but the thick snow and fading light made it impossible to see anything outside—not even the bushes on the lawn were visible. I drew the curtains and went back to sit by the fire.\n\nAs I watched the glowing embers, I started to imagine a scene like a painting I once saw of Heidelberg Castle on the Rhine. Mrs. Fairfax entered unexpectedly, breaking my concentration and dispelling the troubling thoughts that had started to fill my mind in the solitude.\n\nShe said, “Mr. Rochester would like you and your student to join him for tea in the drawing-room this evening. He’s been busy all day and couldn’t invite you sooner.”\n\nI asked, “When does he have tea?”\n\n“At six o’clock,” she replied. “He prefers to keep early hours while in the country.

Then we went downstairs together. Since I wasn’t used to being around strangers, I felt a bit nervous about being formally invited into Mr. Rochester’s presence.

I knew my traveller with his broad and jetty eyebrows; his square forehead, made squarer by the horizontal sweep of his black hair. I recognised his decisive nose, more remarkable for character than beauty; his full nostrils, denoting, I thought, choler; his grim mouth, chin, and jaw—yes, all three were very grim, and no mistake.

At this moment I am not disposed to accost her.”\nI sat down quite disembarrassed. A reception of finished politeness would probably have confused me: I could not have returned or repaid it by answering grace and elegance on my part; but harsh caprice laid me under no obligation; on the contrary, a decent quiescence, under the freak of manner, gave me the advantage.

Pilot the dog was comfortably settled near a large, warm fire, with Adèle kneeling beside him. Mr. Rochester was partially lying on a couch, his foot propped on a cushion, watching Adèle and the dog; the firelight illuminated his face clearly. I immediately recognized the traveller by his wide, dark eyebrows, and his square forehead, which looked even squarer because of his horizontally styled black hair. I identified his determined-looking nose, notable more for character than attractiveness, and his full nostrils, which I thought indicated a temper. His stern mouth, chin, and jaw were all undoubtedly grim. Without his cloak, I saw that his build had the same angularity as his face; I supposed it was a good, athletic physique—broad-chested and narrow-waisted, though not tall or graceful. Mr. Rochester must have seen Mrs. Fairfax and me come in, but he seemed disinclined to acknowledge us immediately, as he didn't look up as we approached. \"Here is Miss Eyre, sir,\" Mrs. Fairfax said quietly. He acknowledged this with a bow but kept his eyes on the dog and child. \"Let Miss Eyre be seated,\" he said. There was something in his strained, stiff bow and impatient yet formal tone that seemed to say, \"Why should I care if Miss Eyre is here? I'm not in the mood to speak to her right now.\" I sat down feeling completely at ease. A very polite greeting would likely have flustered me, as I couldn't have responded with matching grace and elegance.

I could pick out his firm, striking nose—it was notable for its character rather than its looks—as well as his pronounced nostrils, which I thought suggested a quick temper. His mouth, chin, and jaw were all stern and forbidding.

Kindly, as usual—and, as usual, rather trite—she condoled with him on the pressure of business he had had all day; on the annoyance it must have been to him with that painful sprain: then she commended his patience and perseverance in going through with it.\n“Madam, I should like some tea,” was the sole rejoinder she got. She hastened to ring the bell; and when the tray came, she proceeded to arrange the cups, spoons, &c., with assiduous celerity. I and Adèle went to the table; but the master did not leave his couch.\n“Will you hand Mr. Rochester’s cup?” said Mrs. Fairfax to me; “Adèle might perhaps spill it.”\nI did as requested. As he took the cup from my hand, Adèle, thinking the moment propitious for making a request in my favour, cried out—\n“N’est-ce pas, monsieur, qu’il y a un cadeau pour Mademoiselle Eyre dans votre petit coffre?”\n“Who talks of cadeaux?” said he gruffly. “Did you expect a present, Miss Eyre? Are you fond of presents?” and he searched my face with eyes that I saw were dark, irate, and piercing.\n“I hardly know, sir; I have little experience of them: they are generally thought pleasant things.”\n“Generally thought? But what do you think?”\n“I should be obliged to take time, sir, before I could give you an answer worthy of your acceptance: a present has many faces to it, has it not? and one should consider all, before pronouncing an opinion as to its nature.”\n“Miss Eyre, you are not so unsophisticated as Adèle: she demands a ‘cadeau,’ clamorously, the moment she sees me: you beat about the bush.”\n“Because I have less confidence in my deserts than Adèle has: she can prefer the claim of old acquaintance, and the right too of custom; for she says you have always been in the habit of giving her playthings; but if I had to make out a case I should be puzzled, since I am a stranger, and have done nothing to entitle me to an acknowledgment.”\n“Oh, don’t fall back on over-modesty! I have examined Adèle, and find you have taken great pains with her: she is not bright, she has no talents; yet in a short time she has made much improvement.”\n“Sir, you have now given me my ‘cadeau;’ I am obliged to you: it is the meed teachers most covet—praise of their pupils’ progress.”\n“Humph!” said Mr. Rochester, and he took his tea in silence.",

Adèle and I moved towards the table, but our master remained on his sofa. \"Could you hand Mr. Rochester's cup?\" Mrs. Fairfax asked me. \"Adèle might spill it.\" I followed her instruction. As he took the cup from me, Adèle, sensing a good moment to advocate for me, called out, \"Isn't there a gift for Miss Eyre in your little box, sir?\" \"Who is talking about gifts?\" he asked gruffly. \"Were you expecting a present, Miss Eyre? Do you enjoy receiving presents?\" His dark, angry, and sharp eyes scrutinized my face. \"I'm not sure, sir; I've had little experience with them. They are generally considered pleasant.\" \"Generally considered? But what is your opinion?\" \"I would need time, sir, to give you an answer worthy of your approval. A present has many aspects, doesn't it? One should consider all of them before deciding its nature.\" \"Miss Eyre, you are not as simple as Adèle. She demands a 'cadeau' loudly the instant she sees me. You are indirect.\" \"Because I have less confidence in my worthiness than Adèle does. She can rely on her long acquaintance and the right of custom, as she says you always give her toys. But if I had to make a case, I would be at a loss, since I am a stranger and have done nothing to deserve any acknowledgment.\" \"Oh, don't resort to excessive modesty! I have questioned Adèle and see you have worked hard with her. She isn't bright or talented, yet she has improved greatly in a short time.\" \"Sir, you have just given me my 'cadeau.'

Mrs. Fairfax quickly rang for the tea tray and busied herself setting it up. Adèle and I approached the table; Mr. Rochester, however, remained on the couch. \n\n'Miss Eyre, would you hand Mr. Rochester his cup?' Mrs. Fairfax asked me, noting that Adèle might spill it. I complied, and as I gave the cup to Mr. Rochester, Adèle, seizing her chance to advocate for me, exclaimed, 'Isn't there a present for Mademoiselle Eyre in your little chest, sir?'\n\n'Who speaks of presents?' he said gruffly. 'Were you expecting a gift, Miss Eyre? Do you like presents?' He looked at me sharply and intently.\n\n'I cannot say, sir; I have little experience of them. I believe most people consider them pleasant.'\n\n'Most people do? But what about you?'\n\n'I would need time to give you an answer worthy of consideration, sir. Gifts can have various meanings, and it's wise to think about them before deciding what I feel.'\n\n'Miss Eyre, you are not as naive as Adèle. She loudly asks for gifts as soon as she sees me. You, however, hesitate.'\n\n'That's because I'm less confident in deserving a gift, unlike Adèle, who has the claim of old acquaintance and long-standing custom, since you've always given her toys. I am new here and cannot think of any reason why I should expect a gift.'\n\n'Don't be excessively modest! I've assessed Adèle and found you've worked hard with her; she isn't gifted, but she's made much progress in a short time.'\n\n'Sir, with your words you have already given me my present: it is the reward teachers value most—praise for their pupils’ advancement.'\n\n'Humph,' replied Mr. Rochester, as he continued his tea in silence."

Did I break through one of your rings, that you spread that damned ice on the causeway?”\nI shook my head. “The men in green all forsook England a hundred years ago,” said I, speaking as seriously as he had done. “And not even in Hay Lane, or the fields about it, could you find a trace of them. I don’t think either summer or harvest, or winter moon, will ever shine on their revels more.”\nMrs. Fairfax had dropped her knitting, and, with raised eyebrows, seemed wondering what sort of talk this was.\n“Well,” resumed Mr. Rochester, “if you disown parents, you must have some sort of kinsfolk: uncles and aunts?”\n“No; none that I ever saw.”\n“And your home?”\n“I have none.”\n“Where do your brothers and sisters live?”\n“I have no brothers or sisters.”\n“Who recommended you to come here?”\n“I advertised, and Mrs. Fairfax answered my advertisement.”\n“Yes,” said the good lady, who now knew what ground we were upon, “and I am daily thankful for the choice Providence led me to make.

I replied, \"Three months, sir.\" He followed up by asking where I had come from. I told him, \"From Lowood school, in --shire.\" He remarked that it was a charity establishment and inquired how many years I had spent there. \"Eight years,\" I answered. \"Eight years!\" he exclaimed, expressing surprise at my apparent hardiness. He felt that such a place would wear out anyone's health in half that time and speculated that this was why I seemed to have a somewhat ethereal appearance. He admitted he had wondered about my look and, upon encountering me in Hay Lane the previous night, had inexplicably thought of fairy tales, even considering whether I had enchanted his horse, adding that he wasn't entirely sure I hadn't. He then asked about my parents. I stated that I had none. He assumed I never had and asked if I remembered them, to which I replied \"No.\" \"I thought not,\" he said, then humorously asked if I was waiting for fairies (\"the men in green\") when I sat on the stile, suggesting it was an ideal moonlit night for them.

Well, bring me your portfolio then, provided you can assure me the contents are entirely original. But don't give your word unless you're completely certain; I can spot imitations.\" \"In that case, sir, I will say nothing, and you may judge for yourself.\" I retrieved the portfolio from the library. \"Bring it near the table,\" he instructed, and I rolled it closer to his seat. Adèle and Mrs. Fairfax approached to look at the pictures. \"No crowding,\" Mr. Rochester said, \"take the drawings from my hand as I finish reviewing them, but don't lean your faces too close to mine.\" He carefully examined each sketch and painting. He set three aside; the rest, after looking them over, he pushed away from himself. \"Take these to the other table, Mrs. Fairfax,\" he instructed, \"and look at them with Adèle. You,\" (glancing towards me) \"return to your seat and answer my questions. I can see these pictures were all done by the same person: was that person you?\" \"Yes.\" \"And when did you find the time to create them? They seem to have required considerable time and thought.\" \"I did them during the last two holidays I spent at Lowood, as I had nothing else to do.\" \"Where did you find models or inspiration?\" \"From my own imagination.\" \"The mind I now see inside your head?\" \"Yes, sir.\" \"Does it contain other ideas or creations of a similar nature?\" \"I believe it might; I would hope—even better ones.\" He spread the pictures out before him and looked at them again, alternating his gaze between them.",
          "paraphrase_gpt-4.1-2025-04-14": "“A little.”\n“Of course; that's what everyone says. Go into the library, if you would.—(Please forgive my authoritative manner; I'm in the habit of saying, ‘Do this,’ and it's done. It's difficult to change my ways for a newcomer.)—Go ahead to the library, take a candle, leave the door open, sit at the piano, and play something.”\nI followed his instructions and left.\n“That will do!” he called out after a while. “I see you play a little; like most English schoolgirls—perhaps a bit better than some, but not very well.”\nI closed the piano and returned to him. Mr. Rochester went on—\n“Adèle showed me some drawings today, which she claimed were yours. Are they your own work, or did a teacher help you?”\n“No, truly!” I insisted.\n“That stings your pride, does it? Well then, bring me your portfolio, if you can guarantee all the drawings are your own. But don't give me your word unless you are sure—I can tell when something is a mix of different people's work.”\n“Then I won't say anything, and you can decide for yourself, sir.”\nI fetched the portfolio from the library.\n“Come to the table,” he instructed, and I moved it near his sofa. Adèle and Mrs. Fairfax also came over to look at the drawings.\n“No crowding,” Mr. Rochester said, “take the drawings from my hand as I finish looking at them, but don't stick your faces near mine.”\nHe carefully inspected each sketch and painting. Three he set aside as special; the rest he pushed away after examination.\n“Take these over to the other table, Mrs. Fairfax,” he directed, “and look at them with Adèle;—you,” glancing at me, “sit back down and answer me. I can tell these pictures were all done by the same person. Was that person you?”\n“Yes.”\n“And when did you find time to make them? They clearly took effort and time.”\n“I made them during my last two holidays at Lowood, when I had nothing else to do.”\n“Where did you get the models?”\n“I imagined them.”\n“That mind you have now on your shoulders?”\n“Yes, sir.”\n“Is there more of that kind of inspiration inside your head?”\n“I would hope so, and perhaps even better.”\nHe spread the pictures out and studied them again, alternating between them."

          "text_segment": "While he is so occupied, I will tell you, reader, what they are: and first, I must premise that they are nothing wonderful. The subjects had, indeed, risen vividly on my mind. As I saw them with the spiritual eye, before I attempted to embody them, they were striking; but my hand would not second my fancy, and in each case it had wrought out but a pale portrait of the thing I had conceived.\nThese pictures were in water-colours. The first represented clouds low and livid, rolling over a swollen sea: all the distance was in eclipse; so, too, was the foreground; or rather, the nearest billows, for there was no land. One gleam of light lifted into relief a half-submerged mast, on which sat a cormorant, dark and large, with wings flecked with foam; its beak held a gold bracelet set with gems, that I had touched with as brilliant tints as my palette could yield, and as glittering distinctness as my pencil could impart. Sinking below the bird and mast, a drowned corpse glanced through the green water; a fair arm was the only limb clearly visible, whence the bracelet had been washed or torn.\nThe second picture contained for foreground only the dim peak of a hill, with grass and some leaves slanting as if by a breeze. Beyond and above spread an expanse of sky, dark blue as at twilight: rising into the sky was a woman’s shape to the bust, portrayed in tints as dusk and soft as I could combine. The dim forehead was crowned with a star; the lineaments below were seen as through the suffusion of vapour; the eyes shone dark and wild; the hair streamed shadowy, like a beamless cloud torn by storm or by electric travail. On the neck lay a pale reflection like moonlight; the same faint lustre touched the train of thin clouds from which rose and bowed this vision of the Evening Star.\nThe third showed the pinnacle of an iceberg piercing a polar winter sky: a muster of northern lights reared their dim lances, close serried, along the horizon. Throwing these into distance, rose, in the foreground, a head,—a colossal head, inclined towards the iceberg, and resting against it. Two thin hands, joined under the forehead, and supporting it, drew up before the lower features a sable veil; a brow quite bloodless, white as bone, and an eye hollow and fixed, blank of meaning but for the glassiness of despair, alone were visible. Above the temples, amidst wreathed turban folds of black drapery, vague in its character and consistency as cloud, gleamed a ring of white flame, gemmed with sparkles of a more lurid tinge. This pale crescent was “the likeness of a kingly crown;” what it diademed was “the shape which shape had none.”\n“Were you happy when you painted these pictures?” asked Mr. Rochester presently.\n“I was absorbed, sir: yes, and I was happy. To paint them, in short, was to enjoy one of the keenest pleasures I have ever known.”\n“That is not saying much. Your pleasures, by your own account, have been few; but I daresay you did exist in a kind of artist’s dreamland while you blent and arranged these strange tints. Did you sit at them long each day?”\n“I had nothing else to do, because it was the vacation, and I sat at them from morning till noon, and from noon till night: the length of the midsummer days favoured my inclination to apply.”\n“And you felt self-satisfied with the result of your ardent labours?”\n“Far from it. I was tormented by the contrast between my idea and my handiwork: in each case I had imagined something which I was quite powerless to realise.”\n“Not quite: you have secured the shadow of your thought; but no more, probably. You had not enough of the artist’s skill and science to give it full being: yet the drawings are, for a school-girl, peculiar. As to the thoughts, they are elfish. These eyes in the Evening Star you must have seen in a dream. How could you make them look so clear, and yet not at all brilliant? for the planet above quells their rays. And what meaning is that in their solemn depth? And who taught you to paint wind? There is a high gale in that sky, and on this hill-top. Where did you see Latmos? For that is Latmos. There! put the drawings away!”",
          "paraphrase_gemini-2.5-flash-preview-04-17": "While Mr. Rochester is preoccupied, reader, I will describe my pictures, noting upfront that they aren't extraordinary. The ideas behind them were very clear and impactful in my mind's eye before I tried to paint them; however, my artistic skill couldn't match my imagination, resulting in watered-down versions of my original concepts.\n\nThese images were painted with watercolours. The first depicted dark, turbulent clouds hovering over a rough sea. The distant areas and the foreground, or rather, the closest waves, were shrouded in darkness, as there was no land visible. A single beam of light highlighted a partially submerged ship's mast where a large, dark cormorant sat. Its wings were dotted with foam, and its beak clutched a gold bracelet inlaid with jewels, which I had painted using the brightest colours my palette offered and as much detail as my brush allowed. Beneath the bird and mast, a drowned body was faintly visible through the green water; only a pale arm was distinct, from which the bracelet seemed to have been removed or lost.\n\nThe second painting featured a faint hill peak in the foreground with grass and leaves bending as if in a breeze. Above and beyond, the sky stretched out, dark blue like twilight. A woman's figure, visible from the bust up, emerged into the sky, rendered in the soft, dark shades I could create. Her faint forehead bore a star as a crown, while her face below seemed veiled by mist. Her eyes were dark and wild, and her hair streamed like a shadowy cloud, fractured by a storm or electrical energy. A faint, moonlight-like glow rested on her neck and touched the thin trail of clouds from which this vision of the Evening Star emerged and inclined.\n\nThe third painting showed the sharp top of an iceberg piercing the polar winter sky, with faint northern lights standing like closely arranged spears along the horizon. In front of these, dominating the foreground, was a massive head, tilted towards the iceberg and resting against it. Two thin hands were clasped under the forehead, supporting it and drawing a dark veil over the lower part of the face. Only a completely white, bone-like forehead and a hollow, vacant eye—blank except for a glassy look of despair—were visible. Above the temples, within the folds of black, turban-like drapery, which was as indefinite in form and substance as a cloud, gleamed a circle of white flame dotted with sparks of a more eerie colour. This pale crescent was described as \"the likeness of a kingly crown,\" adorning something that was \"the shape which shape had none.\"\n\n\"Were you content while painting these?\" Mr. Rochester inquired shortly after.\n\n\"I was completely engrossed, sir; yes, and I was happy. Painting them was, in essence, one of the most intense enjoyments I've ever known.\"\n\n\"That doesn't say much. By your own admission, you've had few pleasures. Still, I expect you were lost in a kind of artist's fantasy world while you mixed and arranged these unusual colours. Did you spend a lot of time on them daily?\"\n\n\"I had nothing else to occupy me, as it was the school break. I worked on them continuously from morning until night; the long midsummer days allowed me to apply myself thoroughly.\"\n\n\"And you felt pleased with the outcomes of your passionate efforts?\"\n\n\"Quite the opposite. I was frustrated by the gap between my mental image and what I produced. In each case, I had imagined something I simply couldn't bring to life.\"\n\n\"Not entirely. You've captured a hint of your idea, but probably no more. You lacked the artistic skill and technique to fully realize it. Still, for a schoolgirl, the drawings are unusual. As for the concepts, they are strange, almost supernatural. Those eyes in the Evening Star must have come from a dream. How did you manage to make them look so distinct, yet not bright at all? It seems the planet above diminishes their light. And what significance lies in their deep, solemn look? And who taught you to portray wind? There's a strong wind depicted in that sky and on this hilltop. Where did you see Latmos? Because that's Latmos. Now, put the drawings away!\"",
          "paraphrase_gpt-4.1-2025-04-14": "While Mr. Rochester is busy, I'll explain what my paintings depict. First, I should say they’re not especially remarkable. When I first envisioned them, the images in my mind were vivid and powerful, but my artistic skills couldn’t fully do them justice, resulting in paintings less striking than my original ideas. Each watercolor painting shows a unique scene. The first is of dark, ominous clouds rolling over a stormy sea with no land in sight. Only a faint shaft of light highlights a partly submerged ship’s mast occupied by a dark cormorant holding a jeweled bracelet in its beak. Below in the water, you glimpse a drowned body, just a pale arm clearly visible where the bracelet once was. The second painting shows the grassy top of a hill in the wind beneath a twilight sky. Rising into the sky from misty clouds is the upper half of a woman, with a star on her brow, wild eyes, and shadowy, windblown hair. A soft glow, like moonlight, shines on her neck and the wispy clouds near her. The third painting depicts an iceberg piercing a polar sky, Aurora Borealis dim on the horizon. In the foreground, a gigantic, pale head rests against the iceberg, veiled by thin hands and dark cloth, with a ring of white flame—like a crown—shining above. Only the lifeless brow and despairing eye are visible. Mr. Rochester then asked if I had been happy while painting these. I told him that I was absorbed and yes, happy, finding deep pleasure in the work. He pointed out that I had few pleasures in life, but supposed that I had been lost in artistic reverie while working, and wondered if I dedicated long hours to it. I replied that I did, since it was vacation—I worked from morning until night. When he asked if I was satisfied with my efforts, I admitted that I was not: my paintings fell far short of my imagination. He acknowledged that though I hadn’t brought my vision fully to life, I had captured some essence of it, and that my skill and knowledge weren’t enough to do more, but the images were unusual for a young girl. He asked about my inspiration for certain features and advised me to put the drawings away."

Take her to bed.”\nAdèle went to kiss him before quitting the room: he endured the caress, but scarcely seemed to relish it more than Pilot would have done, nor so much.\n“I wish you all good-night, now,” said he, making a movement of the hand towards the door, in token that he was tired of our company, and wished to dismiss us. Mrs. Fairfax folded up her knitting: I took my portfolio: we curtseyed to him, received a frigid bow in return, and so withdrew.\n“You said Mr. Rochester was not strikingly peculiar, Mrs. Fairfax,” I observed, when I rejoined her in her room, after putting Adèle to bed.\n“Well, is he?”\n“I think so: he is very changeful and abrupt.”\n“True: no doubt he may appear so to a stranger, but I am so accustomed to his manner, I never think of it; and then, if he has peculiarities of temper, allowance should be made.”\n“Why?”\n“Partly because it is his nature—and we can none of us help our nature; and partly because he has painful thoughts, no doubt, to harass him, and make his spirits unequal.”\n“What about?”\n“Family troubles, for one thing.”\n“But he has no family.”\n“Not now, but he has had—or, at least, relatives. He lost his elder brother a few years since.”\n“His elder brother?”\n“Yes. The present Mr. Rochester has not been very long in possession of the property; only about nine years.”\n“Nine years is a tolerable time. Was he so very fond of his brother as to be still inconsolable for his loss?”\n“Why, no—perhaps not. I believe there were some misunderstandings between them. Mr. Rowland Rochester was not quite just to Mr. Edward; and perhaps he prejudiced his father against him. The old gentleman was fond of money, and anxious to keep the family estate together. He did not like to diminish the property by division, and yet he was anxious that Mr. Edward should have wealth, too, to keep up the consequence of the name; and, soon after he was of age, some steps were taken that were not quite fair, and made a great deal of mischief. Old Mr. Rochester and Mr. Rowland combined to bring Mr. Edward into what he considered a painful position, for the sake of making his fortune: what the precise nature of that position was I never clearly knew, but his spirit could not brook what he had to suffer in it. He is not very forgiving: he broke with his family, and now for many years he has led an unsettled kind of life. I don’t think he has ever been resident at Thornfield for a fortnight together, since the death of his brother without a will left him master of the estate; and, indeed, no wonder he shuns the old place.”\n“Why should he shun it?”\n“Perhaps he thinks it gloomy.”\nThe answer was evasive. I should have liked something clearer; but Mrs. Fairfax either could not, or would not, give me more explicit information of the origin and nature of Mr. Rochester’s trials. She averred they were a mystery to herself, and that what she knew was chiefly from conjecture. It was evident, indeed, that she wished me to drop the subject, which I did accordingly.",

Why are you allowing Adèle to stay up so late, Miss Eyre? Take her to bed.\" Adèle approached him for a kiss before leaving; he tolerated her embrace but seemed hardly to enjoy it, perhaps less so than his dog, Pilot, might have. \"I bid you both good-night now,\" he declared, gesturing towards the door with his hand, signaling that he was weary of our presence and wished for us to depart. Mrs. Fairfax folded her knitting; I picked up my portfolio. We curtsied to him, received a cold nod in return, and then withdrew. \"You mentioned Mr. Rochester wasn't notably unusual, Mrs. Fairfax,\" I remarked when I rejoined her in her room after settling Adèle for the night. \"And do you still think so?\" she asked. \"I believe he is,\" I replied. \"He is quite inconsistent and abrupt.\" \"That's true,\" she conceded. \"He might appear that way to someone unfamiliar with him, but I am so used to his mannerisms that I hardly notice them anymore. Besides, if he has temperamental peculiarities, allowances should be made for them.\" \"Why is that?\" I inquired. \"Partly because it's inherent in his nature, and none of us can alter our fundamental character,\" she explained. \"And partly because he undoubtedly carries painful burdens that distress him and cause his moods to fluctuate.\" \"What sorts of things trouble him?\" I asked. \"Family difficulties, for one,\" she said. \"But he doesn't have a family now,\" I pointed out. \"Not currently, no, but he did have relatives,\" she clarified. \"He lost his older brother a few years ago.\" \"His *older* brother?\" I repeated. \"Yes. The current Mr. Rochester hasn't owned the property for a very long time, only about nine years.\" \"Nine years is a reasonable period. Was he so devoted to his brother that he remains heartbroken over his death?\" I wondered. \"Well, no, perhaps not,\" she admitted. \"I understand there were some disagreements between them. Mr. Rowland Rochester was not entirely fair to Mr. Edward, and he may have turned their father against him. The elder Mr. Rochester was fond of money and wanted to preserve the family estate. He didn't wish to lessen the property by dividing it, yet he also desired Mr. Edward to have wealth to maintain the family's standing. Shortly after Mr. Edward reached adulthood, certain steps were taken that were rather unfair and resulted in significant trouble. The old Mr. Rochester and Mr. Rowland collaborated to place Mr. Edward in what he considered a difficult situation, purportedly to ensure his fortune. The precise details of that situation were never clear to me, but he couldn't endure what he suffered. He is not very forgiving; he severed ties with his family and has led an unsettled life for many years since. I don't think he has resided at Thornfield for even two weeks straight since his brother's death, which occurred without a will, leaving him the estate. And indeed, it's no surprise he avoids the old place.\" \"Why would he avoid it?\" I asked. \"Perhaps he finds it dismal,\" she responded. Her answer was evasive. I would have preferred a more explicit explanation, but Mrs. Fairfax either could not or would not provide more detailed information regarding the reasons and nature of Mr. Rochester's hardships. She asserted they were a mystery to her as well and that her knowledge was mostly based on guesswork. It was evident she wished me to drop the subject, which I did.",

Also, if he has an odd temperament, allowances should be made.”\nI asked, “Why?”\nShe explained, “It’s partly just his nature, which none of us can help, and partly he’s troubled by things that affect his mood.”\n“What sort of things?” I asked.\n“Family problems, for one.”\n“But he doesn’t have any family.”\n“He used to, but not anymore.

Was he so attached to his brother that he still grieves?”\n“Not really. There were misunderstandings between them. Mr. Rowland Rochester wasn’t always fair to Mr. Edward, and may even have turned their father against him. Their father cared a lot for money and wanted to keep the estate intact, yet also wanted Mr. Edward to be wealthy, which led to some questionable arrangements when Mr. Edward came of age. Old Mr. Rochester and Rowland put Edward in a difficult position, supposedly for his own fortune; I never fully understood the details, but Mr. Edward suffered because of it and didn’t easily forgive. He distanced himself from his family and, ever since his brother’s death left him with the estate, he hasn’t stayed at Thornfield for more than a couple of weeks at a time—he tends to avoid the place.”\n\n“Why does he avoid it?”\n“Maybe he finds it depressing,” she replied, dodging the question. I wished she’d given me a clearer answer, but whether she didn’t know or just wouldn’t say, Mrs. Fairfax insisted Mr. Rochester’s difficulties were largely a mystery to her, and she said most of what she knew was only based on guesswork.

          "text_segment": "For several subsequent days I saw little of Mr. Rochester. In the mornings he seemed much engaged with business, and, in the afternoon, gentlemen from Millcote or the neighbourhood called, and sometimes stayed to dine with him. When his sprain was well enough to admit of horse exercise, he rode out a good deal; probably to return these visits, as he generally did not come back till late at night.\nDuring this interval, even Adèle was seldom sent for to his presence, and all my acquaintance with him was confined to an occasional rencontre in the hall, on the stairs, or in the gallery, when he would sometimes pass me haughtily and coldly, just acknowledging my presence by a distant nod or a cool glance, and sometimes bow and smile with gentlemanlike affability. His changes of mood did not offend me, because I saw that I had nothing to do with their alternation; the ebb and flow depended on causes quite disconnected with me.\nOne day he had had company to dinner, and had sent for my portfolio; in order, doubtless, to exhibit its contents: the gentlemen went away early, to attend a public meeting at Millcote, as Mrs. Fairfax informed me; but the night being wet and inclement, Mr. Rochester did not accompany them. Soon after they were gone he rang the bell: a message came that I and Adèle were to go downstairs. I brushed Adèle’s hair and made her neat, and having ascertained that I was myself in my usual Quaker trim, where there was nothing to retouch—all being too close and plain, braided locks included, to admit of disarrangement—we descended, Adèle wondering whether the petit coffre was at length come; for, owing to some mistake, its arrival had hitherto been delayed. She was gratified: there it stood, a little carton, on the table when we entered the dining-room. She appeared to know it by instinct.\n“Ma boite! ma boite!” exclaimed she, running towards it.\n“Yes, there is your ‘boite’ at last: take it into a corner, you genuine daughter of Paris, and amuse yourself with disembowelling it,” said the deep and rather sarcastic voice of Mr. Rochester, proceeding from the depths of an immense easy-chair at the fireside. “And mind,” he continued, “don’t bother me with any details of the anatomical process, or any notice of the condition of the entrails: let your operation be conducted in silence: tiens-toi tranquille, enfant; comprends-tu?”",
          "paraphrase_gemini-2.5-flash-preview-04-17": "For the next few days, I didn't see much of Mr. Rochester. He appeared busy with matters in the mornings, and in the afternoons, gentlemen from Millcote or nearby would visit and sometimes stay for dinner. When his ankle healed enough for riding, he spent a lot of time on horseback, likely returning visits, as he generally didn't return until late. During this period, even Adèle was rarely summoned to his presence, and my interactions with him were limited to accidental encounters in the house – in the hall, on the stairs, or in the gallery. In these chance meetings, he sometimes passed me with a proud and distant air, acknowledging my presence only with a brief nod or cool look, and at other times, he would bow and smile with polite friendliness. I wasn't bothered by his changes in mood because I recognized they weren't related to me; their variations were due to factors entirely separate from me. One day, he had hosted guests for dinner and had asked for my portfolio, presumably to display its contents. Mrs. Fairfax told me the gentlemen left early to attend a public meeting in Millcote, but Mr. Rochester didn't go with them because the night was wet and stormy. Soon after they departed, he rang the bell, and a message came requesting Adèle and me to go downstairs. I tidied Adèle's hair and clothing, and having checked my own simple, close-fitting \"Quaker trim\" where there was nothing that could become disarranged (including my braided hair), we descended. Adèle was wondering if the small chest, which had been delayed by a mistake, had finally arrived. She was pleased to find it there – a little box on the table in the dining-room when we entered. She seemed to recognize it instantly. \"My box! My box!\" she exclaimed, running towards it. \"Yes, your 'boite' is here at last,\" said Mr. Rochester's deep, rather sarcastic voice from a large easy-chair by the fire. \"Take it into a corner, you true Parisian girl, and amuse yourself by taking everything out.\" He added, \"And remember, don't bother me with any details of the process or descriptions of what's inside; do your work quietly: be still, child; do you understand?\"",
          "paraphrase_gpt-4.1-2025-04-14": "Over the next several days, I rarely saw Mr. Rochester. He was busy with work each morning, and in the afternoons he often had visitors from Millcote or nearby, who sometimes stayed to dine. Once his injury allowed him to ride again, he frequently went out—likely returning their visits—and wouldn't return until late at night. During this period, even Adèle was rarely called to see him. My only contact with him was the occasional brief encounter in the hall, on the stairs, or in the gallery; sometimes he would acknowledge me coldly and distantly, other times he would bow and smile politely. I wasn't offended by these changes, since I knew they had nothing to do with me. One evening, after having guests for dinner and showing them my portfolio, the visitors left early for a public meeting, while Mr. Rochester stayed at home because of the bad weather. Shortly after, we received a message that Adèle and I were to go downstairs. I tidied Adèle and checked my own neat appearance, then we both headed down, with Adèle excitedly hoping her little box had finally arrived after a delay. She was pleased to see it on the table when we walked in and recognized it immediately. She ran to it exclaiming in French, while Mr. Rochester, seated by the fire, told her somewhat sarcastically to take her box to a corner and enjoy opening it quietly, asking her not to bother him with the details or make any noise."

Having removed this impediment, and lifted certain silvery envelopes of tissue paper, she merely exclaimed—\n“Oh ciel! Que c’est beau!” and then remained absorbed in ecstatic contemplation.\n“Is Miss Eyre there?” now demanded the master, half rising from his seat to look round to the door, near which I still stood.\n“Ah! well, come forward; be seated here.” He drew a chair near his own. “I am not fond of the prattle of children,” he continued; “for, old bachelor as I am, I have no pleasant associations connected with their lisp. It would be intolerable to me to pass a whole evening tête-à-tête with a brat. Don’t draw that chair farther off, Miss Eyre; sit down exactly where I placed it—if you please, that is. Confound these civilities! I continually forget them. Nor do I particularly affect simple-minded old ladies. By-the-bye, I must have mine in mind; it won’t do to neglect her; she is a Fairfax, or wed to one; and blood is said to be thicker than water.”\nHe rang, and despatched an invitation to Mrs. Fairfax, who soon arrived, knitting-basket in hand.\n“Good evening, madam; I sent to you for a charitable purpose. I have forbidden Adèle to talk to me about her presents, and she is bursting with repletion; have the goodness to serve her as auditress and interlocutrice; it will be one of the most benevolent acts you ever performed.”\nAdèle, indeed, no sooner saw Mrs. Fairfax, than she summoned her to her sofa, and there quickly filled her lap with the porcelain, the ivory, the waxen contents of her “boite;” pouring out, meantime, explanations and raptures in such broken English as she was mistress of.\n“Now I have performed the part of a good host,” pursued Mr. Rochester, “put my guests into the way of amusing each other, I ought to be at liberty to attend to my own pleasure. Miss Eyre, draw your chair still a little farther forward: you are yet too far back; I cannot see you without disturbing my position in this comfortable chair, which I have no mind to do.”\nI did as I was bid, though I would much rather have remained somewhat in the shade; but Mr. Rochester had such a direct way of giving orders, it seemed a matter of course to obey him promptly.\nWe were, as I have said, in the dining-room: the lustre, which had been lit for dinner, filled the room with a festal breadth of light; the large fire was all red and clear; the purple curtains hung rich and ample before the lofty window and loftier arch; everything was still, save the subdued chat of Adèle (she dared not speak loud), and, filling up each pause, the beating of winter rain against the panes.\nMr. Rochester, as he sat in his damask-covered chair, looked different to what I had seen him look before; not quite so stern—much less gloomy. There was a smile on his lips, and his eyes sparkled, whether with wine or not, I am not sure; but I think it very probable. He was, in short, in his after-dinner mood; more expanded and genial, and also more self-indulgent than the frigid and rigid temper of the morning; still he looked preciously grim, cushioning his massive head against the swelling back of his chair, and receiving the light of the fire on his granite-hewn features, and in his great, dark eyes; for he had great, dark eyes, and very fine eyes, too—not without a certain change in their depths sometimes, which, if it was not softness, reminded you, at least, of that feeling.\nHe had been looking two minutes at the fire, and I had been looking the same length of time at him, when, turning suddenly, he caught my gaze fastened on his physiognomy.",
          "paraphrase_gemini-2.5-flash-preview-04-17": "Adèle didn't seem to require the warning; she was already settled on a sofa with her box of treasures, busy untying the string holding the lid shut. After removing this and lifting some sheer, shiny tissue paper layers, she simply cried out, \"Oh heaven! How beautiful!\" and then became completely absorbed in admiring them. \"Is Miss Eyre present?\" the master now asked, slightly rising to peer around towards the door where I was still standing. \"Ah! Good, come forward; sit down here.\" He pulled a chair close to his own. He went on, \"I'm not fond of children's chatter; being an old bachelor, I have no pleasant memories associated with their lisping. It would be unbearable for me to spend an entire evening alone with a child. Don't push that chair further away, Miss Eyre; sit exactly where I placed it, if you please. Blast these formalities! I constantly forget them. Nor do I particularly care for simple-minded old women. By the way, I must remember mine; I shouldn't neglect her; she is a Fairfax, or married to one; and family ties are said to be stronger than other relationships.\" He rang a bell and sent for Mrs. Fairfax, who arrived shortly with her knitting basket. \"Good evening, madam; I sent for you for a benevolent reason. I've told Adèle she can't discuss her presents with me, and she's overflowing with things to say; please be kind enough to listen to her and talk with her; it would be one of the kindest things you could do.\" Indeed, as soon as Adèle saw Mrs. Fairfax, she called her to the sofa and quickly filled her lap with the porcelain, ivory, and wax items from her \"box,\" excitedly explaining everything in the limited broken English she knew. \"Now that I've acted as a good host,\" Mr. Rochester continued, \"by helping my guests entertain each other, I should be free to enjoy myself. Miss Eyre, pull your chair a little closer still; you are still too far away; I can't see you without changing my position in this comfortable chair, which I don't want to do.\" I did as I was asked, although I would much rather have stayed somewhat out of sight; but Mr. Rochester's way of giving orders was so direct that it felt natural to obey him right away. As I mentioned, we were in the dining room: the chandelier, lit for dinner, filled the room with a bright, festive light; the large fire glowed red and clear; the rich, heavy purple curtains hung in front of the tall window and even taller archway; everything was quiet, except for Adèle's soft talking (she didn't dare speak loudly), and, filling each quiet moment, the sound of the winter rain beating against the windowpanes. Mr. Rochester, sitting in his chair covered with patterned fabric, looked different from how I had seen him before; not as severe - much less gloomy. He had a smile on his lips, and his eyes sparkled, perhaps from wine, though I wasn't certain, but I thought it quite likely. In short, he was in his after-dinner mood; more open and friendly, and also more relaxed than his stern, strict manner of the morning; yet he still looked quite formidable, resting his large head against the padded back of his chair, the firelight illuminating his strong, sculpted features and his large, dark eyes; for he had large, dark eyes, and very beautiful ones, too - sometimes with a certain change in their depth that, if not tenderness, at least brought that feeling to mind. He had been looking at the fire for two minutes, and I had been looking at him for the same amount of time, when, suddenly turning, he caught my gaze fixed on his face.",
          "paraphrase_gpt-4.1-2025-04-14": "Adèle hardly needed to be told to keep quiet; she had already settled herself on the sofa with her gift and was eagerly undoing the string that held the box shut. Once she removed the cord and layers of delicate tissue paper, she exclaimed in French at how beautiful it was, then sat silently, completely wrapped up in admiration. At that moment, Mr. Rochester asked if Miss Eyre was present, glancing towards the doorway where I stood. He asked me to come forward and sit near him, pulling up a chair for me. He confessed that, being an old bachelor, he didn't care for children's chatter and wouldn’t enjoy spending an entire evening alone with one. He insisted that I sit exactly where he placed the chair, although he admitted he often forgot such social niceties. He also mentioned he wasn’t fond of simple, elderly women but reminded himself not to neglect Mrs. Fairfax because of family ties. He rang the bell and had Mrs. Fairfax invited to join us; she soon entered, knitting basket in hand. Mr. Rochester explained to her that he had forbidden Adèle from talking to him about her presents and asked Mrs. Fairfax to listen to and converse with Adèle, considering it an act of kindness. As soon as Adèle saw Mrs. Fairfax, she invited her over and enthusiastically showed off her box’s contents, explaining and praising each item in her imperfect English. Afterwards, Mr. Rochester remarked that now, having helped his guests entertain one another, he could attend to his own enjoyment. He told me again to move my chair closer since I was still too far away, stating he didn’t want to change his comfortable position just to see me better. I complied, although I would have preferred to remain more out of sight, but Mr. Rochester’s straightforward commands seemed natural to obey. We were in the dining room, brightly lit for dinner, with a large, lively fire and rich purple curtains adorning the tall windows and archways. The only sounds were Adèle’s subdued conversation and the soft taps of winter rain against the window. Sitting in his upholstered chair, Mr. Rochester appeared less stern and gloomy than usual; his lips even held a slight smile and his eyes were bright—perhaps from wine. He seemed more relaxed and friendly than he had in the morning but still looked rather formidable, his strong features illuminated by the fire. For a couple of minutes, he stared at the flames and I watched him, until he suddenly turned and caught me gazing at him."

By my word! there is something singular about you,” said he: “you have the air of a little nonnette; quaint, quiet, grave, and simple, as you sit with your hands before you, and your eyes generally bent on the carpet (except, by-the-bye, when they are directed piercingly to my face; as just now, for instance); and when one asks you a question, or makes a remark to which you are obliged to reply, you rap out a round rejoinder, which, if not blunt, is at least brusque. What do you mean by it?”\n“Sir, I was too plain; I beg your pardon. I ought to have replied that it was not easy to give an impromptu answer to a question about appearances; that tastes mostly differ; and that beauty is of little consequence, or something of that sort.”\n“You ought to have replied no such thing. Beauty of little consequence, indeed! And so, under pretence of softening the previous outrage, of stroking and soothing me into placidity, you stick a sly penknife under my ear! Go on: what fault do you find with me, pray? I suppose I have all my limbs and all my features like any other man?”\n“Mr. Rochester, allow me to disown my first answer: I intended no pointed repartee: it was only a blunder.”\n“Just so: I think so: and you shall be answerable for it. Criticise me: does my forehead not please you?”\nHe lifted up the sable waves of hair which lay horizontally over his brow, and showed a solid enough mass of intellectual organs, but an abrupt deficiency where the suave sign of benevolence should have risen.\n“Now, ma’am, am I a fool?”\n“Far from it, sir. You would, perhaps, think me rude if I inquired in return whether you are a philanthropist?”\n“There again! Another stick of the penknife, when she pretended to pat my head: and that is because I said I did not like the society of children and old women (low be it spoken!). No, young lady, I am not a general philanthropist; but I bear a conscience;” and he pointed to the prominences which are said to indicate that faculty, and which, fortunately for him, were sufficiently conspicuous; giving, indeed, a marked breadth to the upper part of his head: “and, besides, I once had a kind of rude tenderness of heart. When I was as old as you, I was a feeling fellow enough; partial to the unfledged, unfostered, and unlucky; but Fortune has knocked me about since: she has even kneaded me with her knuckles, and now I flatter myself I am hard and tough as an India-rubber ball; pervious, though, through a chink or two still, and with one sentient point in the middle of the lump. Yes: does that leave hope for me?”\n“Hope of what, sir?”\n“Of my final re-transformation from India-rubber back to flesh?”\n“Decidedly he has had too much wine,” I thought; and I did not know what answer to make to his queer question: how could I tell whether he was capable of being re-transformed?",
          "paraphrase_gemini-2.5-flash-preview-04-17": "He questioned me, saying, “Miss Eyre, you’re examining me; do you consider me good-looking?” My inclination, had I paused to think, would have been to give a typically vague and courteous response; however, the answer escaped me before I could stop it— “No, sir.” “Indeed! Upon my word, there is something unusual about you,” he commented. “You have the appearance of a small nun; you are peculiar, quiet, serious, and plain, sitting there with your hands clasped and your gaze usually fixed on the floor (except, incidentally, when you look intently into my face, as you did just now, for instance); and when you are asked a question or a comment is made that requires a reply, you deliver a direct response that is, if not truly impolite, certainly abrupt. What is the meaning of this behaviour?” “Sir, I was too direct; I apologize. I ought to have replied that assessing appearances on the spot is difficult, that tastes vary widely, and that beauty isn't very important, or something along those lines.” “You should have said nothing of the sort. Beauty being of little importance, really! So, under the guise of smoothing over your initial offense, of calming and soothing me into politeness, you subtly stab me! Continue: what faults do you find with me, please tell me? I assume I possess all my limbs and features like any other man?” “Mr. Rochester, please allow me to retract my first answer; I didn't intend a sharp retort; it was simply an error.” “Precisely; I believe that's the case; and you will be held accountable for it. Critique me: does my forehead not meet your approval?” He lifted the dark waves of hair that lay flat across his forehead, revealing a substantial area associated with intellect, but a noticeable deficit where the smooth indicator of kindness should have been prominent. “Now, madam, am I unintelligent?” “Far from it, sir. You might, perhaps, consider me rude if I were to ask in return if you are a philanthropist?” “There it is again! Another hidden jab, when she pretended to be comforting me; and that's because I mentioned I dislike the company of children and elderly women (let's keep that quiet!). No, young woman, I am not a universal philanthropist; but I possess a conscience;” and he pointed to the bumps on his head said to represent that faculty, which, fortunately for him, were quite prominent, indeed giving a distinct width to the upper part of his head: “and, moreover, I once had a sort of rough tender-heartedness. When I was your age, I was quite a sensitive person; inclined towards those who were unprotected, unsupported, and unfortunate; but Fate has battered me since then: she has even pummeled me with her knuckles, and now I flatter myself that I am as resilient and tough as a rubber ball; though still penetrable through a crack or two, and with one sensitive core within the mass. Yes: does that offer any hope for me?” “Hope for what, sir?” “For my eventual change back from rubber to flesh?” “He must have had too much wine,” I thought; and I was unsure how to respond to his peculiar question: how could I possibly know if he was capable of undergoing such a transformation?",
          "paraphrase_gpt-4.1-2025-04-14": "Mr. Rochester asked Jane if she found him handsome. Without thinking, Jane honestly answered no, although she later realized she should have responded in a more polite and noncommittal way, mentioning that opinions on beauty vary and it does not matter much. Rochester commented on Jane’s unusual frankness and calm demeanor, saying she was direct, even brusque, in her answers, and asked why she spoke that way. Jane apologized, insisting she meant no offense and that her bluntness was a mistake. Rochester pressed her to critique him, even exposing his forehead for her to judge, questioning if she thought him a fool. Jane denied it, and turned the conversation to whether he considered himself philanthropic. Rochester wryly noted that she continued with her sharp comments, and admitted he was not a general philanthropist, but claimed to have a conscience and said he was once tender-hearted, especially to the vulnerable. Life’s hardships, however, had toughened him, though he suggested he was still vulnerable in some ways and wondered if there was hope for his transformation back to a softer nature. Jane privately suspected he might be drunk and was at a loss as to how to answer his odd question."

Young lady, I am disposed to be gregarious and communicative to-night.”\nWith this announcement he rose from his chair, and stood, leaning his arm on the marble mantelpiece: in that attitude his shape was seen plainly as well as his face; his unusual breadth of chest, disproportionate almost to his length of limb. I am sure most people would have thought him an ugly man; yet there was so much unconscious pride in his port; so much ease in his demeanour; such a look of complete indifference to his own external appearance; so haughty a reliance on the power of other qualities, intrinsic or adventitious, to atone for the lack of mere personal attractiveness, that, in looking at him, one inevitably shared the indifference, and, even in a blind, imperfect sense, put faith in the confidence.\n“I am disposed to be gregarious and communicative to-night,” he repeated, “and that is why I sent for you: the fire and the chandelier were not sufficient company for me; nor would Pilot have been, for none of these can talk. Adèle is a degree better, but still far below the mark; Mrs. Fairfax ditto; you, I am persuaded, can suit me if you will: you puzzled me the first evening I invited you down here.

It would please me now to draw you out—to learn more of you—therefore speak.”\nInstead of speaking, I smiled; and not a very complacent or submissive smile either.\n“Speak,” he urged.\n“What about, sir?”\n“Whatever you like. I leave both the choice of subject and the manner of treating it entirely to yourself.”\nAccordingly I sat and said nothing: “If he expects me to talk for the mere sake of talking and showing off, he will find he has addressed himself to the wrong person,” I thought.\n“You are dumb, Miss Eyre.”\nI was dumb still. He bent his head a little towards me, and with a single hasty glance seemed to dive into my eyes.\n“Stubborn?” he said, “and annoyed. Ah! it is consistent. I put my request in an absurd, almost insolent form. Miss Eyre, I beg your pardon. The fact is, once for all, I don’t wish to treat you like an inferior: that is” (correcting himself), “I claim only such superiority as must result from twenty years’ difference in age and a century’s advance in experience. This is legitimate, et j’y tiens, as Adèle would say; and it is by virtue of this superiority, and this alone, that I desire you to have the goodness to talk to me a little now, and divert my thoughts, which are galled with dwelling on one point—cankering as a rusty nail.”\nHe had deigned an explanation, almost an apology, and I did not feel insensible to his condescension, and would not seem so.\n“I am willing to amuse you, if I can, sir—quite willing; but I cannot introduce a topic, because how do I know what will interest you? Ask me questions, and I will do my best to answer them.”",
          "paraphrase_gemini-2.5-flash-preview-04-17": "Mr. Rochester remarked that I looked quite bewildered, Miss Eyre. He added that although I am not attractive any more than he is handsome, looking puzzled becomes me. Furthermore, it is practical because it diverts my sharp eyes away from his face and keeps them occupied with the patterns on the rug. He encouraged me to continue puzzling, announcing, \"Young lady, I feel like being sociable and talkative tonight.\" With that statement, he got up from his chair and stood with his arm resting on the marble fireplace. In this stance, both his figure and face were clearly visible. His chest was remarkably broad, almost disproportionate to the length of his limbs. I am certain most people would have considered him unattractive. Yet, his bearing held such unconscious pride, his manner such ease, and his expression such complete disregard for his own physical appearance, combined with such arrogant faith in the power of other qualities, whether inherent or acquired, to compensate for a lack of simple personal appeal, that when observing him, one couldn't help but share his indifference and, even in a vague, uncertain way, believe in his self-assurance. \"I feel like being sociable and talkative tonight,\" he repeated, \"and that's precisely why I summoned you. The fire and the chandelier weren't enough company for me, nor would Pilot have been, as none of them can converse. Adèle is somewhat better, but still far from adequate. Mrs. Fairfax is the same. I am convinced you can satisfy my need for company if you are willing. You perplexed me the first evening I asked you to come down here. I've almost forgotten you since then; other thoughts have pushed yours out of my mind. But tonight, I am determined to relax, to dismiss whatever bothers me and recall what is pleasant. It would please me now to engage you in conversation—to learn more about you—so speak.\" Instead of speaking, I smiled, and it wasn't a particularly agreeable or compliant smile either. \"Speak,\" he insisted. \"About what, sir?\" I asked. \"Whatever you wish. I leave the choice of both the subject and the way you discuss it entirely to you.\" Consequently, I remained seated and said nothing. I thought to myself, \"If he expects me to talk just for the sake of talking and showing off, he will discover he has addressed the wrong person.\" \"You are silent, Miss Eyre.\" I remained silent. He tilted his head slightly towards me and, with a swift, single glance, seemed to penetrate my eyes. \"Stubborn?\" he said, \"and annoyed. Ah, that fits. I phrased my request in a ridiculous, almost rude manner. Miss Eyre, I apologize. The truth is, once and for all, I have no desire to treat you as an inferior. That is,\" he corrected himself, \"I only claim the kind of superiority that naturally arises from a twenty-year age difference and a century's advantage in experience. This is legitimate, and I maintain it, as Adèle would say. And it is by virtue of this superiority, and this alone, that I request you have the kindness to talk to me a little now and divert my thoughts, which are troubled by dwelling on a single point—eating away at me like a rusty nail.\" He had condescended to offer an explanation, nearly an apology, and I was not unmoved by his graciousness and didn't wish to appear so. \"I am willing to entertain you, if I can, sir—quite willing. But I cannot introduce a subject because how would I know what would interest you? Ask me questions, and I will do my utmost to answer them.\"",
          "paraphrase_gpt-4.1-2025-04-14": "\"You look rather confused, Miss Eyre; and although neither of us would be called attractive, being puzzled actually suits you. Besides, it distracts your keen eyes from staring at my face and instead focuses them on the carpet's embroidery, so continue wondering. Tonight, I feel sociable and talkative.\" After saying this, he stood up from his chair and leaned his arm on the marble mantelpiece, making his figure, including his broad chest and somewhat unbalanced proportions, quite visible. Most people would likely have considered him unattractive, but there was such unselfconscious pride in his bearing, an easy confidence, an utter disregard for his appearance, and a strong trust in his other qualities to make up for a lack of good looks, that anyone observing him would naturally mirror that indifference and, even without knowing why, share in his self-assurance.\n\n\"I'm feeling sociable and talkative tonight,\" he said again, \"and that's why I called for you: the fire and the chandelier aren't enough company. Nor is Pilot—the dog can’t talk. Adèle is a bit better, but still not quite enough; Mrs. Fairfax the same. I believe you could entertain me if you want to: you intrigued me the first night you came here. I almost forgot about you since then, as other matters took over my mind; but tonight, I want some relaxation—to forget my troubles and focus on what's pleasant. I'd enjoy drawing you out and getting to know you better, so please, speak.\" Instead of answering, I simply smiled, and it wasn't a particularly shy or agreeable smile.\n\n\"Go on, speak,\" he insisted.\n\n\"About what, sir?\" I asked.\n\n\"Whatever you wish. Choose the topic and how you discuss it—it's entirely up to you.\" So I stayed quiet; I thought, \"If he expects me to talk just for the sake of it, and to show off, he's chosen the wrong person.\"\n\n\"You're silent, Miss Eyre,\" he remarked. I still said nothing. He leaned his head a bit towards me and glanced quickly into my eyes.\n\n\"Are you being stubborn? And a bit annoyed? I deserve that. I asked you in a strange, even rude way. Miss Eyre, I apologize. Honestly, I don't want to treat you as an inferior: except\" (he corrected himself), \"I do claim the upper hand simply by being twenty years older and much more experienced. That's legitimate, as Adèle would say, and it's only by that right that I ask you to please talk to me for a while and distract me from thoughts that are bothering me—eating away at me like rust.\"\n\nHe had explained himself, even apologized, and I appreciated his humility and wanted to show it.\n\n\"I'm happy to entertain you, sir, if I can, but I can't think of a topic—how should I know what would interest you? If you ask questions, I'll try my best to answer.\""

Reply clearly.”\n“I don’t think, sir, you have a right to command me, merely because you are older than I, or because you have seen more of the world than I have; your claim to superiority depends on the use you have made of your time and experience.”\n“Humph! Promptly spoken. But I won’t allow that, seeing that it would never suit my case, as I have made an indifferent, not to say a bad, use of both advantages. Leaving superiority out of the question, then, you must still agree to receive my orders now and then, without being piqued or hurt by the tone of command. Will you?”\nI smiled: I thought to myself Mr. Rochester is peculiar—he seems to forget that he pays me £30 per annum for receiving his orders.\n“The smile is very well,” said he, catching instantly the passing expression; “but speak too.”\n“I was thinking, sir, that very few masters would trouble themselves to inquire whether or not their paid subordinates were piqued and hurt by their orders.”\n“Paid subordinates! What! you are my paid subordinate, are you? Oh yes, I had forgotten the salary! Well then, on that mercenary ground, will you agree to let me hector a little?”\n“No, sir, not on that ground; but, on the ground that you did forget it, and that you care whether or not a dependent is comfortable in his dependency, I agree heartily.”\n“And will you consent to dispense with a great many conventional forms and phrases, without thinking that the omission arises from insolence?”\n“I am sure, sir, I should never mistake informality for insolence: one I rather like, the other nothing free-born would submit to, even for a salary.”\n“Humbug! Most things free-born will submit to anything for a salary; therefore, keep to yourself, and don’t venture on generalities of which you are intensely ignorant. However, I mentally shake hands with you for your answer, despite its inaccuracy; and as much for the manner in which it was said, as for the substance of the speech; the manner was frank and sincere; one does not often see such a manner: no, on the contrary, affectation, or coldness, or stupid, coarse-minded misapprehension of one’s meaning are the usual rewards of candour. Not three in three thousand raw school-girl-governesses would have answered me as you have just done. But I don’t mean to flatter you: if you are cast in a different mould to the majority, it is no merit of yours: Nature did it. And then, after all, I go too fast in my conclusions: for what I yet know, you may be no better than the rest; you may have intolerable defects to counterbalance your few good points.”",
          "paraphrase_gemini-2.5-flash-preview-04-17": "Mr. Rochester began by asking if I agreed that he had the right to be somewhat authoritative, abrupt, or even demanding sometimes, based on his claim that he was old enough to be my father, had vast and varied experiences interacting with many people across numerous countries, and had travelled extensively, in contrast to my quiet, confined life with one group in a single location. I replied simply, \"Do as you please, sir.\" He found this irritating and evasive, insisting on a clearer response. I stated my belief that his right to command me did not stem merely from being older or more worldly than I; rather, any claim to superiority depended on how he had utilized his time and experiences. He reacted with a grunt, calling my answer quick but refusing to accept it, as it wouldn't justify his own conduct, acknowledging he had made poor use of his advantages. Setting aside the issue of superiority, he asked if I would still agree to accept his orders occasionally without feeling offended or upset by his tone of command. I smiled internally, thinking how odd Mr. Rochester was, seemingly forgetting that I was paid an annual salary of £30 precisely for receiving his instructions. Noticing my smile, he prompted me to speak. I remarked that few masters would bother to ask if their paid employees were bothered or hurt by their directives. \"Paid subordinates!\" he exclaimed, surprised. \"So, you are my paid subordinate? Oh yes, I'd forgotten the salary!\" He then asked if, purely on the basis of that financial arrangement, I would tolerate him being somewhat overbearing. I refused to agree on that basis, but readily consented because he *had* forgotten the salary and demonstrated concern for a dependent's comfort. He then inquired if I would agree to overlook many conventional formalities and expressions without assuming their absence indicated rudeness. I assured him I would never confuse informality with insolence, stating I quite liked the former but that no one truly independent would tolerate the latter, even for money. He dismissed this as nonsense, claiming most independent individuals would endure anything for payment, and advised me to stick to my own limited knowledge rather than making broad, uninformed statements. Nevertheless, he added that he mentally approved of my answer despite its inaccuracy, appreciating both its content and its frank, sincere delivery, a quality he rarely encountered, finding affectation, coldness, or dull misunderstanding more common reactions to honesty. He suggested that not one in a thousand inexperienced governesses would have responded as I had. However, he clarified he wasn't flattering me; if I was different from most, he saw it as innate rather than earned merit, concluding by saying he might be judging me too quickly and that, for all he knew, I might have significant flaws counteracting my good qualities.",
          "paraphrase_gpt-4.1-2025-04-14": "First, do you concede that I have a right to be a bit domineering, abrupt, or demanding at times, based on my reasons: I’m old enough to be your father, and I’ve experienced much of the world, meeting many people and traveling far, while your life has been sheltered in a single home among the same people? \"Do as you wish, sir.\" \"That’s not an answer—it’s evasive and quite vexing. Please answer directly.\" \"I don’t believe, sir, that your age or worldliness gives you the right to order me about; your authority should rely on how you’ve used your time and experience.\" \"Well said. But I can’t accept that, since I haven’t used my age or experience all that well. Putting authority aside, you still need to accept my directions from time to time, without being offended by how I give them. Can you do that?\" I smiled, thinking Mr. Rochester is unusual—he seems to overlook that he pays me £30 a year for following his instructions. \"That smile is fine,\" he noted, noticing my fleeting expression immediately, \"but say something too.\" \"I was considering, sir, that not many employers care if their paid employees are offended by orders.\" \"Paid employees! Oh, so you’re my paid subordinate? I forgot about your pay! So on that basis, will you let me boss you a bit?\" \"No, sir, not for that reason; but because you forgot and actually care about your employee’s comfort, I gladly agree.\" \"And will you be alright if we skip a lot of formalities, without thinking I’m being rude?\" \"I’m sure, sir, I’d never confuse informality with rudeness: I actually prefer informality, but no one truly free would endure rudeness, not even for a salary.\" \"Nonsense! Most free people will endure anything for money; so keep your opinion to yourself and don’t generalize. Still, I mentally congratulate you for your answer and how you spoke it—it was honest and open, which is rare. Usually, frankness is met with pretension, coldness, or simple misunderstanding. Hardly any young, inexperienced governess would have answered as you did. Still, I’m not flattering you: if you’re different from most, it’s not due to any merit—it’s just your nature. And I’m perhaps judging too quickly; for all I know, you might have faults that outweigh your virtues.\""

God wot I need not be too severe about others; I have a past existence, a series of deeds, a colour of life to contemplate within my own breast, which might well call my sneers and censures from my neighbours to myself. I started, or rather (for like other defaulters, I like to lay half the blame on ill fortune and adverse circumstances) was thrust on to a wrong tack at the age of one-and-twenty, and have never recovered the right course since: but I might have been very different; I might have been as good as you—wiser—almost as stainless. I envy you your peace of mind, your clean conscience, your unpolluted memory. Little girl, a memory without blot or contamination must be an exquisite treasure—an inexhaustible source of pure refreshment: is it not?”\n“How was your memory when you were eighteen, sir?”\n“All right then; limpid, salubrious: no gush of bilge water had turned it to fetid puddle. I was your equal at eighteen—quite your equal. Nature meant me to be, on the whole, a good man, Miss Eyre; one of the better kind, and you see I am not so. You would say you don’t see it; at least I flatter myself I read as much in your eye (beware, by-the-bye, what you express with that organ; I am quick at interpreting its language). Then take my word for it,—I am not a villain: you are not to suppose that—not to attribute to me any such bad eminence; but, owing, I verily believe, rather to circumstances than to my natural bent, I am a trite commonplace sinner, hackneyed in all the poor petty dissipations with which the rich and worthless try to put on life. Do you wonder that I avow this to you? Know, that in the course of your future life you will often find yourself elected the involuntary confidant of your acquaintances’ secrets: people will instinctively find out, as I have done, that it is not your forte to tell of yourself, but to listen while others talk of themselves; they will feel, too, that you listen with no malevolent scorn of their indiscretion, but with a kind of innate sympathy; not the less comforting and encouraging because it is very unobtrusive in its manifestations.”\n“How do you know?—how can you guess all this, sir?”\n“I know it well; therefore I proceed almost as freely as if I were writing my thoughts in a diary. You would say, I should have been superior to circumstances; so I should—so I should; but you see I was not. When fate wronged me, I had not the wisdom to remain cool: I turned desperate; then I degenerated. Now, when any vicious simpleton excites my disgust by his paltry ribaldry, I cannot flatter myself that I am better than he: I am forced to confess that he and I are on a level. I wish I had stood firm—God knows I do! Dread remorse when you are tempted to err, Miss Eyre; remorse is the poison of life.”\n“Repentance is said to be its cure, sir.”\n“It is not its cure. Reformation may be its cure; and I could reform—I have strength yet for that—if—but where is the use of thinking of it, hampered, burdened, cursed as I am? Besides, since happiness is irrevocably denied me, I have a right to get pleasure out of life: and I will get it, cost what it may.”\n“Then you will degenerate still more, sir.”\n“Possibly: yet why should I, if I can get sweet, fresh pleasure? And I may get it as sweet and fresh as the wild honey the bee gathers on the moor.”\n“It will sting—it will taste bitter, sir.”\n“How do you know?—you never tried it. How very serious—how very solemn you look: and you are as ignorant of the matter as this cameo head” (taking one from the mantelpiece). “You have no right to preach to me, you neophyte, that have not passed the porch of life, and are absolutely unacquainted with its mysteries.”\n“I only remind you of your own words, sir: you said error brought remorse, and you pronounced remorse the poison of existence.”\n“And who talks of error now? I scarcely think the notion that flittered across my brain was an error. I believe it was an inspiration rather than a temptation: it was very genial, very soothing—I know that. Here it comes again! It is no devil, I assure you; or if it be, it has put on the robes of an angel of light. I think I must admit so fair a guest when it asks entrance to my heart.”\n“Distrust it, sir; it is not a true angel.”\n“Once more, how do you know? By what instinct do you pretend to distinguish between a fallen seraph of the abyss and a messenger from the eternal throne—between a guide and a seducer?”\n“I judged by your countenance, sir, which was troubled when you said the suggestion had returned upon you. I feel sure it will work you more misery if you listen to it.”\n“Not at all—it bears the most gracious message in the world: for the rest, you are not my conscience-keeper, so don’t make yourself uneasy. Here, come in, bonny wanderer!”\nHe said this as if he spoke to a vision, viewless to any eye but his own; then, folding his arms, which he had half extended, on his chest, he seemed to enclose in their embrace the invisible being.\n“Now,” he continued, again addressing me, “I have received the pilgrim—a disguised deity, as I verily believe.

Heaven knows I shouldn't be too harsh on others; I have a past life, a history of actions, a character to examine within myself that should make me direct my sneers and criticisms towards myself, not my neighbors. I started, or rather (because, like others who have messed up, I like to blame bad luck and circumstances partly) was forced onto a wrong path at twenty-one and haven't found the right one since. But I could have been very different; I could have been as good as you—wiser—almost as pure. I envy your peace of mind, your clear conscience, your untainted memory.

I was your equal at eighteen—quite your equal. Nature intended me to be, overall, a good man, Miss Eyre; one of the better kind, and you see I'm not.

Are you surprised I admit this to you? Know that throughout your future life, you will often find yourself unintentionally becoming the confidante of your acquaintances' secrets. People will sense instinctively, as I have, that your strength isn't in talking about yourself, but in listening to others talk about themselves. They will also feel that you listen without malicious contempt for their lack of discretion, but with a kind of natural sympathy; it's no less comforting and encouraging just because it's expressed so subtly.\" \"How do you know?—how can you guess all this, sir?\" \"I know it well; therefore, I speak almost as freely as if I were writing my thoughts in a diary. You would say I should have been superior to circumstances; yes, I should have—I should have; but you see I wasn't.

I hardly think the idea that just flickered through my mind was an error. I believe it was more an inspiration than a temptation; it was very pleasant, very calming—I know that. Here it comes again! It's no devil, I assure you; or if it is, it has taken the form of an angel of light. I think I must welcome such a beautiful guest when it asks to enter my heart.\" \"Distrust it, sir; it is not a true angel.\" \"Once again, how do you know? By what intuition do you claim to tell the difference between a fallen angel from the depths and a messenger from God—between a guide and a tempter?\" \"I judged by your face, sir, which looked troubled when you said the suggestion had returned. I feel sure it will cause you more unhappiness if you listen to it.\" \"Not at all—it carries the most wonderful message in the world. As for the rest, you are not my keeper of conscience, so don't trouble yourself. Here, come in, lovely wanderer!\" He said this as if speaking to a vision visible only to him; then, folding his arms, which he had partially extended, across his chest, he seemed to embrace the invisible being within them. \"Now,\" he continued, turning back to me, \"I have welcomed the pilgrim—a deity in disguise, I truly believe. It has already done me good; my heart was like a tomb; it will now be a sacred place.\"",
          "paraphrase_gpt-4.1-2025-04-14": "\"And so may you,\" I thought to myself. As our eyes met, he seemed to sense my thought and responded as if I’d spoken aloud—\n\n\"Yes, yes, you’re correct,\" he admitted. \"I have many faults; I’m well aware and don’t try to excuse them. Truly, I have no right to judge others harshly, since my own life gives me plenty to reflect on critically. My past is full of actions and experiences that should turn my mockery inward rather than toward others. At twenty-one, whether through my own failings or misfortune, I went astray and never found my way back. But I could have been different, perhaps just as good as you—wiser, almost as blameless. I envy your calm, your clear conscience, your untainted memory. A memory without marks or stains must be a wonderful treasure—an endless source of comfort. Don’t you think so?\"\n\n\"What was your memory like at eighteen, sir?\" I asked.\n\n\"Spotless then—pure and healthy; nothing had yet corrupted it. I was just like you at that age. Nature intended me to be a good man, Miss Eyre—one of the better sort. But as you see, I haven’t become that. You might say you don’t see it, and I think I saw that in your eyes (be careful, by the way, as I’m good at reading expressions). Still, believe me—I’m not a villain, far from it. More from circumstances than from my nature, I became an ordinary sinner, indulging in the same trivial pastimes that the wealthy use to fill their empty lives. Does it surprise you that I admit this? You should know—as you go through life, many people will confide in you their secrets. Like me, they’ll sense that you listen deeply and kindly, not judging. You seem to find your strength not in talking about yourself but in being a compassionate listener, even if it’s a quiet and gentle sympathy.\"\n\n\"How can you know this, sir? How do you guess it?\"\n\n\"I know it well, which is why I’m speaking as freely as if I were writing in a diary. You might think I should have risen above my circumstances, and perhaps I should have—but I didn’t. When fate treated me unfairly, I panicked and lost my way. Now, whenever I see someone behaving badly, I can’t pretend I’m any better. I wish I’d resisted—God, I do! Miss Eyre, beware of remorse. Remorse is life’s poison.\"\n\n\"Repentance is said to cure it, sir.\"\n\n\"Repentance is not the cure—reform might be. I could change; I still have the strength for it—if only… But what’s the use, weighed down as I am? Besides, since happiness is beyond my reach, I’m entitled to whatever joy I can find, whatever the cost.\"\n\n\"That may cause you to degrade yourself even more, sir.\"\n\n\"Perhaps. But why should it, if the pleasure is pure and sweet? Maybe I can find happiness as fresh as wild honey on the moors.\"\n\n\"It will hurt you—it will become bitter.\"\n\n\"How would you know? You’ve never experienced it. You look so serious and earnest, but you’re as naïve as this cameo\" (he picked one up from the mantel). \"You can’t preach to me, when you’ve hardly begun to live or to understand its complexities.\"\n\n\"I only remind you of your own words: you said mistakes bring remorse, and remorse is poison.\"\n\n\"And who’s talking about mistakes now? I don’t truly think the thought on my mind was a mistake—it felt more like inspiration, warm and soothing. It’s back again! It’s no demon, or if it is, it disguises itself as an angel. I think I have to let such a comforting guest into my heart.\"\n\n\"Distrust it, sir; it’s not a true angel.\"\n\n\"Again, how do you know? By what instinct do you claim to tell the difference between a fallen angel and a true messenger—a guide and a tempter?\"\n\n\"I saw your troubled expression, sir, when you said the thought had come back. I’m sure that listening to it will only bring you more suffering.\"\n\n\"No, not at all—it brings the gentlest message. In any case, you’re not my conscience; don’t worry yourself. Welcome, then, my lovely invisible visitor!\"\n\nHe said this to something only he could see, and folded his arms across his chest as if to embrace the unseen being.\n\nThen he turned to me and said, \"I’ve accepted this visitor—a god in disguise, I believe. Already I feel better; my heart, which was once like a tomb, feels now like a shrine.\""

Only one thing, I know: you said you were not as good as you should like to be, and that you regretted your own imperfection;—one thing I can comprehend: you intimated that to have a sullied memory was a perpetual bane. It seems to me, that if you tried hard, you would in time find it possible to become what you yourself would approve; and that if from this day you began with resolution to correct your thoughts and actions, you would in a few years have laid up a new and stainless store of recollections, to which you might revert with pleasure.”\n“Justly thought; rightly said, Miss Eyre; and, at this moment, I am paving hell with energy.”\n“Sir?”\n“I am laying down good intentions, which I believe durable as flint. Certainly, my associates and pursuits shall be other than they have been.”\n“And better?”\n“And better—so much better as pure ore is than foul dross. You seem to doubt me; I don’t doubt myself: I know what my aim is, what my motives are; and at this moment I pass a law, unalterable as that of the Medes and Persians, that both are right.”\n“They cannot be, sir, if they require a new statute to legalise them.”\n“They are, Miss Eyre, though they absolutely require a new statute: unheard-of combinations of circumstances demand unheard-of rules.”\n“That sounds a dangerous maxim, sir; because one can see at once that it is liable to abuse.”\n“Sententious sage! so it is: but I swear by my household gods not to abuse it.”\n“You are human and fallible.”\n“I am: so are you—what then?”\n“The human and fallible should not arrogate a power with which the divine and perfect alone can be safely intrusted.”\n“What power?”\n“That of saying of any strange, unsanctioned line of action,—‘Let it be right.’”\n“‘Let it be right’—the very words: you have pronounced them.”\n“May it be right then,” I said, as I rose, deeming it useless to continue a discourse which was all darkness to me; and, besides, sensible that the character of my interlocutor was beyond my penetration; at least, beyond its present reach; and feeling the uncertainty, the vague sense of insecurity, which accompanies a conviction of ignorance.\n“Where are you going?”\n“To put Adèle to bed: it is past her bedtime.”\n“You are afraid of me, because I talk like a Sphynx.”\n“Your language is enigmatical, sir: but though I am bewildered, I am certainly not afraid.”\n“You are afraid—your self-love dreads a blunder.”\n“In that sense I do feel apprehensive—I have no wish to talk nonsense.”\n“If you did, it would be in such a grave, quiet manner, I should mistake it for sense. Do you never laugh, Miss Eyre? Don’t trouble yourself to answer—I see you laugh rarely; but you can laugh very merrily: believe me, you are not naturally austere, any more than I am naturally vicious. The Lowood constraint still clings to you somewhat; controlling your features, muffling your voice, and restricting your limbs; and you fear in the presence of a man and a brother—or father, or master, or what you will—to smile too gaily, speak too freely, or move too quickly: but, in time, I think you will learn to be natural with me, as I find it impossible to be conventional with you; and then your looks and movements will have more vivacity and variety than they dare offer now. I see at intervals the glance of a curious sort of bird through the close-set bars of a cage: a vivid, restless, resolute captive is there; were it but free, it would soar cloud-high. You are still bent on going?”\n“It has struck nine, sir.”\n“Never mind,—wait a minute: Adèle is not ready to go to bed yet. My position, Miss Eyre, with my back to the fire, and my face to the room, favours observation. While talking to you, I have also occasionally watched Adèle (I have my own reasons for thinking her a curious study,—reasons that I may, nay, that I shall, impart to you some day). She pulled out of her box, about ten minutes ago, a little pink silk frock; rapture lit her face as she unfolded it; coquetry runs in her blood, blends with her brains, and seasons the marrow of her bones. ‘Il faut que je l’essaie!’ cried she, ‘et à l’instant même!’ and she rushed out of the room. She is now with Sophie, undergoing a robing process: in a few minutes she will re-enter; and I know what I shall see,—a miniature of Céline Varens, as she used to appear on the boards at the rising of—But never mind that. However, my tenderest feelings are about to receive a shock: such is my presentiment; stay now, to see whether it will be realised.”\nEre long, Adèle’s little foot was heard tripping across the hall. She entered, transformed as her guardian had predicted. A dress of rose-coloured satin, very short, and as full in the skirt as it could be gathered, replaced the brown frock she had previously worn; a wreath of rosebuds circled her forehead; her feet were dressed in silk stockings and small white satin sandals.\n“Est-ce que ma robe va bien?” cried she, bounding forwards; “et mes souliers? et mes bas? Tenez, je crois que je vais danser!”\nAnd spreading out her dress, she chasséed across the room till, having reached Mr. Rochester, she wheeled lightly round before him on tip-toe, then dropped on one knee at his feet, exclaiming—\n“Monsieur, je vous remercie mille fois de votre bonté;” then rising, she added, “C’est comme cela que maman faisait, n’est-ce pas, monsieur?”\n“Pre-cise-ly!” was the answer; “and, ‘comme cela,’ she charmed my English gold out of my British breeches’ pocket. I have been green, too, Miss Eyre,—ay, grass green: not a more vernal tint freshens you now than once freshened me. My Spring is gone, however, but it has left me that French floweret on my hands, which, in some moods, I would fain be rid of. Not valuing now the root whence it sprang; having found that it was of a sort which nothing but gold dust could manure, I have but half a liking to the blossom, especially when it looks so artificial as just now. I keep it and rear it rather on the Roman Catholic principle of expiating numerous sins, great or small, by one good work. I’ll explain all this some day. Good-night.”",
          "paraphrase_gemini-2.5-flash-preview-04-17": "Honestly, sir,\" I replied, \"I don't understand you at all; I can't keep up with the conversation because it's beyond my understanding. I only grasp two things: you admitted you weren't as good as you wished and regretted your flaws, and you implied that a tainted past is a constant burden. It seems to me that with significant effort, you could eventually become someone you approve of. By resolving to change your thoughts and actions starting today, within a few years, you could build up a new, pure set of memories you could look back on with pleasure.\" \"Well thought, rightly said, Miss Eyre,\" he responded, \"and right now, I'm energetically making good intentions, though I might as well be paving the way to hell with them. I'm setting down resolutions I believe are as strong as rock. My companions and activities will certainly be different from now on.\" \"And better?\" I asked. \"And better – as much better as pure metal is than worthless waste. You seem to doubt me, but I don't doubt myself. I know my goal and my reasons, and at this moment, I declare them both right, like a law as unbreakable as those of ancient empires.\" \"They can't be right, sir,\" I countered, \"if they need a new rule to make them lawful.\" \"They are right, Miss Eyre, even if they absolutely require a new rule,\" he insisted. \"Extraordinary circumstances demand extraordinary regulations.\" \"That sounds like a dangerous principle, sir,\" I observed, \"because it's clear it could easily be misused.\" \"Wise words indeed!\" he exclaimed. \"And it is. But I swear by all I hold dear that I won't misuse it.\" \"You are human and capable of error.\" \"I am, and so are you. What does that matter?\" \"Those who are human and fallible shouldn't claim a power that can only be safely given to the divine and perfect.\" \"What power?\" he asked. \"The power to declare any unusual, unapproved course of action as 'right'.\" \"'Let it be right' – those are the exact words,\" he said. \"You've spoken them.\" \"Then I hope it *may* be right,\" I said as I stood up, feeling it was pointless to continue a discussion that was completely unclear to me. Also, I was aware that I couldn't fully understand his character, at least not yet, and I felt the uncertainty and vague sense of insecurity that comes with realizing your own ignorance. \"Where are you going?\" he asked. \"To put Adèle to bed; it's past her bedtime.\" \"You're afraid of me because I talk like a Sphinx.\" \"Your language is puzzling, sir,\" I admitted, \"but though I'm confused, I'm certainly not afraid.\" \"You *are* afraid – your pride fears making a mistake.\" \"In that sense, I do feel cautious – I have no desire to speak nonsense.\" \"If you did, you'd do it in such a serious, quiet way, I'd mistake it for wisdom. Do you never laugh, Miss Eyre? Don't bother to answer – I see you laugh rarely, but you are capable of laughing very joyfully. Believe me, you are no more naturally severe than I am naturally wicked. The restrictions from Lowood still cling to you somewhat, controlling your expressions, muffling your voice, and limiting your movements. You fear, in the presence of a man, a fellow being – or a father, or a master, or whatever you see me as – to smile too cheerfully, speak too freely, or move too quickly. But, I think eventually you will learn to be natural with me, as I find it impossible to be formal with you. Then your looks and movements will show more liveliness and variety than they dare show now. I occasionally glimpse a curious bird through the closely spaced bars of a cage: a vibrant, restless, determined captive is there; if only it were free, it would soar to the clouds. Are you still set on leaving?\" \"It has struck nine, sir,\" I replied. \"Never mind – wait a minute; Adèle isn't ready for bed yet. My position here, Miss Eyre, with my back to the fire and facing the room, allows me to observe. While talking to you, I've also been occasionally watching Adèle (I have my own reasons for finding her an interesting subject – reasons I may, indeed, shall, tell you someday). About ten minutes ago, she took a little pink silk dress out of her box; joy lit up her face as she unfolded it. Coquetry is in her nature, mixed with her thoughts, and runs through her very being. 'I must try it on!' she exclaimed in French, 'and immediately!' And she rushed out of the room. She's now with Sophie, getting dressed. She'll be back in a few minutes, and I know what I'll see – a miniature of Céline Varens, just as she used to look on stage when the curtain rose – But never mind that. However, my deepest feelings are about to be tested; that's my premonition. Stay now to see if it comes true.\" Soon after, Adèle's small footsteps were heard tripping across the hall. She entered, transformed just as her guardian had predicted. Instead of the brown dress she wore before, she had on a rose-coloured satin dress, very short and as full as possible in the skirt. A circlet of rosebuds adorned her forehead, and her feet were clad in silk stockings and tiny white satin sandals. \"Does my dress fit well?\" she cried in French, bounding forward; \"and my shoes? and my stockings? Look, I think I'm going to dance!\" And spreading out her dress, she glided across the room until she reached Mr. Rochester. She twirled lightly on her toes in front of him, then dropped to one knee at his feet, exclaiming, \"Sir, I thank you a thousand times for your kindness.\" Then, rising, she added, \"That's how Mama used to do it, wasn't it, sir?\" \"Precisely!\" he answered. \"And 'that's how' she charmed my English money out of my British pockets. I've been foolish too, Miss Eyre – yes, completely naive. No fresher youthful colour brightens you now than once brightened me. My youthful period is gone, however, but it has left me with that French girl to care for, and sometimes I wish I could be rid of her. Not valuing the source she came from now, having discovered she was only interested in money, I only half care for the child, especially when she looks as artificial as she does now. I keep and raise her more out of a sense of duty, like a Catholic performing a good work to atone for many sins, big or small. I'll explain all this someday. Good-night.\"",
          "paraphrase_gpt-4.1-2025-04-14": "To be honest, sir, I don’t really follow what you’re saying. I can’t keep up with this conversation as it’s beyond my understanding. The one thing I do get is that you said you’re not the person you want to be, that you’re disappointed in your own flaws; and I understand that you mentioned having a tainted memory is a constant burden. I think that if you really tried, you could eventually become someone you respect; and if you set your mind today to change your thoughts and actions, in a few years you’d have a collection of good memories to look back on happily.”\n\n“Well spoken, Miss Eyre, and right now, I’m making strong efforts, as if paving a road to hell.”\n\n“Sir?”\n\n“I’m laying out good intentions, strong as stone. My friends and interests will certainly be different going forward.”\n\n“And better ones?”\n\n“Much better—like pure metal compared to impure waste. You doubt me, but I don’t doubt myself: I know what I want and why. I now make an unchangeable rule, as firm as ancient law, that both my aims and motives are good.”\n\n“They can’t be if it takes a new law to make them acceptable.”\n\n“They are, Miss Eyre, even if they do need a new law: unusual situations call for unusual rules.”\n\n“That sounds like a dangerous principle, sir; it seems easy to misuse.”\n\n“Wise words! That’s true, but I vow not to abuse it.”\n\n“You’re only human and can make mistakes.”\n\n“I am, and so are you—what then?”\n\n“People who are human and make mistakes shouldn’t claim powers only divine and perfect beings should have.”\n\n“What power is that?”\n\n“The power to declare any odd, unapproved action to be right.”\n\n“‘Let it be right’—those are exactly your words.”\n\n“So be it, I said, as I got up, thinking it was pointless to keep talking since I couldn’t understand him, and realizing his character was beyond what I could grasp, leaving me with a vague sense of uncertainty that comes from not knowing.”\n\n“Where are you going?”\n\n“To put Adèle to bed; it’s past her bedtime.”\n\n“You’re scared of me because I speak in riddles.”\n\n“Your words are puzzling, sir: but though I’m confused, I’m not afraid.”\n\n“You are afraid—your pride fears making a mistake.”\n\n“In that way, yes—I don’t want to say anything foolish.”\n\n“If you did, you’d do it so seriously I might think it made sense. Do you ever laugh, Miss Eyre? Don’t answer—I can see you laugh rarely, but you can laugh happily: you’re not naturally strict, any more than I’m naturally bad. The discipline from Lowood still holds you back; controlling your expressions, quieting your voice, restricting how you move. You hesitate to smile, speak openly, or move quickly around a man or authority. Over time, I think you’ll act yourself with me, as I can’t be formal with you; then your looks and movements will be more lively and expressive than now. Occasionally, I catch a glimpse of a lively bird behind the bars of a cage: there’s an energetic, determined captive in you; if it were free, it would fly high. You still want to leave?”\n\n“It’s nine o’clock, sir.”\n\n“No matter—wait a bit: Adèle isn’t ready for bed yet. Standing here by the fire, facing the room, I notice things as we talk. I’ve also been watching Adèle (I have my reasons for finding her interesting, which I’ll explain to you one day). About ten minutes ago, she took out a pink silk dress; she looked delighted as she unfolded it; showing off seems natural to her. ‘I must try it on this instant!’ she cried and ran from the room. She’s with Sophie now, getting dressed: soon she’ll come back; and I know what I’ll see—a little version of Céline Varens as she used to look when the curtains rose—never mind that. Still, I feel my emotions are about to be put to the test. Stay and see if I’m right.”\n\nSoon, Adèle’s light footsteps were heard in the hall. She entered, changed just as Mr. Rochester anticipated. Where there had been a brown dress, there was now a short, full rose-colored satin one; she wore a crown of rosebuds, silk stockings, and small white satin shoes.\n\n“Does my dress look nice?” she cried, dancing forward; “And my shoes? And my stockings? Watch, I think I’ll dance!”\n\nShe spread her dress, skipped across the room to Mr. Rochester, spun on tiptoe, then knelt at his feet, saying—\n\n“Sir, thank you a thousand times for your kindness”; then, getting up, she added, “This is what Mama used to do, isn’t it, sir?”\n\n“Exactly!” he replied. “And just like that she charmed money out of my pocket. I too have been naïve, Miss Eyre—very naïve: as fresh as the spring that once freshened me, but is now gone. All I have left is this French child, which sometimes I wish I could be rid of. Since I now know her origins needed only money to flourish, I care little for them, and don’t like the child much when she seems so artificial as now. I raise her now more as a sort of penance for my sins. I’ll explain this all to you another time. Good night.”"

It was one afternoon, when he chanced to meet me and Adèle in the grounds: and while she played with Pilot and her shuttlecock, he asked me to walk up and down a long beech avenue within sight of her.\nHe then said that she was the daughter of a French opera-dancer, Céline Varens, towards whom he had once cherished what he called a “grande passion.” This passion Céline had professed to return with even superior ardour. He thought himself her idol, ugly as he was: he believed, as he said, that she preferred his “taille d’athlète” to the elegance of the Apollo Belvidere.\n“And, Miss Eyre, so much was I flattered by this preference of the Gallic sylph for her British gnome, that I installed her in an hotel; gave her a complete establishment of servants, a carriage, cashmeres, diamonds, dentelles, &c. In short, I began the process of ruining myself in the received style, like any other spoony. I had not, it seems, the originality to chalk out a new road to shame and destruction, but trode the old track with stupid exactness not to deviate an inch from the beaten centre. I had—as I deserved to have—the fate of all other spoonies. Happening to call one evening when Céline did not expect me, I found her out; but it was a warm night, and I was tired with strolling through Paris, so I sat down in her boudoir; happy to breathe the air consecrated so lately by her presence. No,—I exaggerate; I never thought there was any consecrating virtue about her: it was rather a sort of pastille perfume she had left; a scent of musk and amber, than an odour of sanctity. I was just beginning to stifle with the fumes of conservatory flowers and sprinkled essences, when I bethought myself to open the window and step out on to the balcony. It was moonlight and gaslight besides, and very still and serene. The balcony was furnished with a chair or two; I sat down, and took out a cigar,—I will take one now, if you will excuse me.”",
          "paraphrase_gemini-2.5-flash-preview-04-17": "Mr. Rochester recounted this story on a later occasion. It occurred one afternoon when he encountered me and Adèle outdoors. While Adèle played with her dog Pilot and her shuttlecock nearby, he suggested we walk along a long avenue lined with beech trees, staying within her view. He then disclosed that Adèle's mother was a French opera performer named Céline Varens, for whom he had previously held what he termed a \"grande passion,\" or intense attraction. Céline, he added, had claimed to feel an even stronger passion for him in return. Despite his plain appearance, he believed he was her idol, saying he thought she preferred his 'athletic build' to the classical beauty of the Apollo Belvidere statue. \"And, Miss Eyre,\" he continued, \"I was so flattered by this preference shown by the French 'sylph' for her English 'gnome' that I rented a hotel suite for her, provided a full household staff, a carriage, expensive items like cashmeres, diamonds, and lace, among other things. In essence, I started the typical process of financially ruining myself, just like any other naive fool. It seems I lacked the creativity to invent a new path to embarrassment and destruction, but instead followed the old one with foolish precision, not deviating from the usual course. As I deserved, I met the same fate as other 'spoonies.' By chance, I visited one evening when Céline wasn't expecting me and found she was out. However, it was a warm night, and I was weary from walking around Paris, so I decided to wait in her boudoir. I was initially pleased to breathe the air recently touched by her presence. No, I'm exaggerating; I never believed there was anything sacred about her. It was more like the smell of her strong perfume, a mix of musk and amber, that filled the air, not an aura of holiness. I was just starting to feel suffocated by the heavy scent of hothouse flowers and sprayed fragrances when I thought to open the window and step onto the balcony. It was lit by both moonlight and gaslight and was very still and peaceful. The balcony had a couple of chairs; I sat down and took out a cigar—I'll have one now, if you don't mind.\"",
          "paraphrase_gpt-4.1-2025-04-14": "At a later time, Mr. Rochester clarified the situation. One afternoon, he happened upon me and Adèle in the gardens; while Adèle played nearby, he invited me to walk with him along a long beech-lined path where she could still be seen. He then revealed that Adèle was the daughter of a French opera dancer named Céline Varens, with whom he had once been deeply infatuated. Céline claimed to care for him with even greater passion than he felt for her. Despite considering himself unattractive, he believed she preferred his sturdy, athletic build over more traditional beauty. Mr. Rochester confessed to being so pleased by Céline’s preference for him, an awkward Englishman, that he set her up in a hotel with a household of servants, a carriage, expensive clothing, and jewelry. Essentially, he began to squander his wealth in a common, foolish manner, taking the same path to ruin as many others before him. Predictably, he was rewarded with the fate he deserved. One night, when Céline was not expecting him, he stopped by her place but found her out. Feeling tired after wandering Paris, he waited in her luxurious sitting room, not because of any holiness about her but rather a lingering perfumed scent. Finding the room stuffy with fragrant flowers and perfumes, he decided to open a window and step onto the balcony. It was a calm night, lit by both moon and gaslight, so he sat outside, took a seat, and began to smoke a cigar—just as he said he would in that moment, asking permission to do so."

Naturally, my heart pounded impatiently against the iron railing I was leaning on. Just as I expected, the carriage halted at the hotel entrance. My 'flame' (which is the perfect term for a lover met at the opera) stepped out. Although she was wrapped in a cloak – quite unnecessary, incidentally, on such a warm June night – I recognised her immediately by her small foot, visible beneath her dress hem as she gracefully dismounted. Leaning over the balcony, I prepared to whisper 'My angel' – in a voice, naturally, intended only for a lover's ears – when another person quickly exited the carriage right after her.

She stood there, by that beech-trunk—a hag like one of those who appeared to Macbeth on the heath of Forres. ‘You like Thornfield?’ she said, lifting her finger; and then she wrote in the air a memento, which ran in lurid hieroglyphics all along the house-front, between the upper and lower row of windows, ‘Like it if you can!

He described her asking if he liked Thornfield and then writing a challenging message across the house's facade: 'Like it if you can! Like it if you dare!'

Varens entered?”\nI almost expected a rebuff for this hardly well-timed question, but, on the contrary, waking out of his scowling abstraction, he turned his eyes towards me, and the shade seemed to clear off his brow. “Oh, I had forgotten Céline! Well, to resume. When I saw my charmer thus come in accompanied by a cavalier, I seemed to hear a hiss, and the green snake of jealousy, rising on undulating coils from the moonlit balcony, glided within my waistcoat, and ate its way in two minutes to my heart’s core. Strange!” he exclaimed, suddenly starting again from the point. “Strange that I should choose you for the confidant of all this, young lady; passing strange that you should listen to me quietly, as if it were the most usual thing in the world for a man like me to tell stories of his opera-mistresses to a quaint, inexperienced girl like you! But the last singularity explains the first, as I intimated once before: you, with your gravity, considerateness, and caution were made to be the recipient of secrets. Besides, I know what sort of a mind I have placed in communication with my own: I know it is one not liable to take infection: it is a peculiar mind: it is a unique one. Happily I do not mean to harm it: but, if I did, it would not take harm from me. The more you and I converse, the better; for while I cannot blight you, you may refresh me.” After this digression he proceeded—\n“I remained in the balcony. ‘They will come to her boudoir, no doubt,’ thought I: ‘let me prepare an ambush.’ So putting my hand in through the open window, I drew the curtain over it, leaving only an opening through which I could take observations; then I closed the casement, all but a chink just wide enough to furnish an outlet to lovers’ whispered vows: then I stole back to my chair; and as I resumed it the pair came in. My eye was quickly at the aperture. Céline’s chamber-maid entered, lit a lamp, left it on the table, and withdrew. The couple were thus revealed to me clearly: both removed their cloaks, and there was ‘the Varens,’ shining in satin and jewels,—my gifts of course,—and there was her companion in an officer’s uniform; and I knew him for a young roué of a vicomte—a brainless and vicious youth whom I had sometimes met in society, and had never thought of hating because I despised him so absolutely. On recognising him, the fang of the snake Jealousy was instantly broken; because at the same moment my love for Céline sank under an extinguisher. A woman who could betray me for such a rival was not worth contending for; she deserved only scorn; less, however, than I, who had been her dupe.\n“They began to talk; their conversation eased me completely: frivolous, mercenary, heartless, and senseless, it was rather calculated to weary than enrage a listener. A card of mine lay on the table; this being perceived, brought my name under discussion. Neither of them possessed energy or wit to belabour me soundly, but they insulted me as coarsely as they could in their little way: especially Céline, who even waxed rather brilliant on my personal defects—deformities she termed them. Now it had been her custom to launch out into fervent admiration of what she called my ‘beauté mâle:’ wherein she differed diametrically from you, who told me point-blank, at the second interview, that you did not think me handsome. The contrast struck me at the time and—”\nAdèle here came running up again.\n“Monsieur, John has just been to say that your agent has called and wishes to see you.”\n“Ah! in that case I must abridge. Opening the window, I walked in upon them; liberated Céline from my protection; gave her notice to vacate her hotel; offered her a purse for immediate exigencies; disregarded screams, hysterics, prayers, protestations, convulsions; made an appointment with the vicomte for a meeting at the Bois de Boulogne. Next morning I had the pleasure of encountering him; left a bullet in one of his poor etiolated arms, feeble as the wing of a chicken in the pip, and then thought I had done with the whole crew. But unluckily the Varens, six months before, had given me this filette Adèle, who, she affirmed, was my daughter; and perhaps she may be, though I see no proofs of such grim paternity written in her countenance: Pilot is more like me than she. Some years after I had broken with the mother, she abandoned her child, and ran away to Italy with a musician or singer. I acknowledged no natural claim on Adèle’s part to be supported by me, nor do I now acknowledge any, for I am not her father; but hearing that she was quite destitute, I e’en took the poor thing out of the slime and mud of Paris, and transplanted it here, to grow up clean in the wholesome soil of an English country garden. Mrs. Fairfax found you to train it; but now you know that it is the illegitimate offspring of a French opera-girl, you will perhaps think differently of your post and protégée: you will be coming to me some day with notice that you have found another place—that you beg me to look out for a new governess, &c.—Eh?”",
          "paraphrase_gemini-2.5-flash-preview-04-17": "Adèle ran ahead of him with her shuttlecock. He yelled sharply, \"Go away! Stay back, child, or go inside to Sophie!\" He then continued walking in silence. I decided to try and bring him back to the subject he had abruptly left. \"Did you leave the balcony, sir,\" I asked, \"when Mademoiselle Varens came in?\" I half-expected a harsh reply for asking such a seemingly ill-timed question, but instead, he shook off his scowling thoughts, looked at me, and his expression seemed to clear. \"Oh, I had forgotten Céline! Right, back to the story.\" He explained that seeing his beloved enter with a male companion felt like hearing a hiss, and the \"green snake of jealousy\" coiled up from the moonlit balcony, slithered into his chest, and devoured his heart within minutes. \"Odd!\" he suddenly exclaimed, changing the subject again. \"Odd that I'm telling all this to you, young lady, making you my confidante; incredibly odd that you're listening calmly, as if a man like me talking about his opera-mistresses to a peculiar, inexperienced girl like you is completely normal! But as I hinted before, the second strangeness explains the first: your serious, thoughtful, and careful nature makes you suitable for receiving secrets. Besides, I know the kind of mind I'm sharing with mine: I know it's not easily tainted; it's a unique mind. Thankfully, I don't intend to harm it, but even if I did, it wouldn't be harmed by me. The more we talk, the better; because while I can't damage you, you can revitalize me.\" After this detour, he continued. \"I stayed on the balcony. 'They'll surely go to her private room,' I thought, 'I'll set an ambush.' So I reached through the open window and pulled the curtain across, leaving just a gap to observe through; then I closed the window, leaving only a narrow slit wide enough for lovers' whispers to escape. I then crept back to my chair, and as I sat down, the pair entered. My eye was immediately at the opening. Céline's maid came in, lit a lamp, placed it on the table, and left. This clearly revealed the couple. Both took off their cloaks. There was 'the Varens,' glittering in satin and jewels—gifts from me, of course—and there was her companion in an officer's uniform; I recognized him as a young, immoral Vicomte, a foolish and wicked youth I'd sometimes met in society, whom I'd never bothered hating because I utterly despised him. Upon recognizing him, the fangs of jealousy were instantly broken; because at the same moment, my affection for Céline was extinguished. A woman who would betray me for such a rival was not worth pursuing; she deserved only scorn, less, however, than I did for being her dupe. \"They began to talk; their conversation completely relieved my tension. It was trivial, greedy, heartless, and senseless, more likely to bore a listener than enrage them. One of my cards was on the table; they saw it and started discussing my name. Neither had the strength or cleverness to genuinely criticize me, but they insulted me as crudely as they could in their limited way, especially Céline, who even became rather sharp about my physical flaws—calling them deformities. Now, it had been her habit to praise what she called my 'manly beauty' profusely, differing completely from you, who told me frankly during our second meeting that you didn't think I was handsome. That contrast struck me at the time and—\" Adèle ran up again at this point. \"Monsieur, John just came to say your agent has arrived and wishes to see you.\" \"Ah! In that case, I must shorten the story.\" Opening the window, I walked in on them. I ended my protection of Céline; told her to leave her hotel; gave her money for immediate needs; ignored her screams, hysterics, pleas, protests, and fits. I arranged to meet the Vicomte in the Bois de Boulogne. The next morning, I had the satisfaction of confronting him; I shot him in one of his poor, weak arms, as feeble as a sick chicken's wing, and then thought I was finished with the whole group. But unfortunately, six months earlier, Varens had given me this little girl, Adèle, claiming she was my daughter; and perhaps she is, though I see no sign of such stern paternity in her face; Pilot looks more like me than she does. Some years after I had broken up with the mother, she abandoned her child and ran away to Italy with a musician or singer. I didn't acknowledge any natural obligation to support Adèle, nor do I now, as I'm not her father; but hearing she was completely destitute, I decided to take the poor child out of the squalor of Paris and bring her here, to grow up cleanly in the healthy environment of an English country garden. Mrs. Fairfax found you to educate her. But now that you know she's the illegitimate child of a French opera-girl, you'll perhaps feel differently about your job and your student; you'll likely come to me soon saying you've found another position, asking me to look for a new governess, etc.—Right?\"",
          "paraphrase_gpt-4.1-2025-04-14": "Adèle ran ahead of Mr. Rochester, playing with her shuttlecock. He sternly told her to keep away or stay with Sophie and then continued walking in silence. I took the opportunity to bring him back to his earlier story. I hesitantly asked if he had left the balcony when Mademoiselle Varens arrived. I expected him to be irritated by my question, but instead, he turned towards me, his expression softening, and began to recollect. He explained that seeing Céline Varens enter with another man made him extremely jealous, as if jealousy itself had entered his chest and reached his heart. He remarked how odd it was that he should confide in someone like me, a quiet and inexperienced girl, but concluded that my thoughtful nature made me an ideal confidant. He felt that our conversations were beneficial to him and would do no harm to me. He then described how he stayed on the balcony, hid himself, and watched as Céline and a young, shallow nobleman entered the room and removed their cloaks. When he recognized the vicomte, his jealousy faded, and his love for Céline vanished. Their conversation was shallow and mercenary, and when they discussed him, Céline made fun of his appearance, a stark contrast to her previous flattery and to my own blunt honesty. At that point, Adèle came to say his agent had arrived. Mr. Rochester quickly finished his story, saying he confronted Céline, ended their relationship, provided her with some money, and challenged the vicomte to a duel, in which he wounded the young man. He felt finished with them, but several months earlier, Céline had left Adèle in his care, claiming she was his daughter, though he doubted the truth of it. After Céline abandoned Adèle and fled to Italy, and knowing the child was destitute, he took Adèle in to give her a better life, though he didn't acknowledge her as his own. He then asked if knowing Adèle’s background would make me reconsider my role as her governess."

How could I possibly prefer the spoilt pet of a wealthy family, who would hate her governess as a nuisance, to a lonely little orphan, who leans towards her as a friend?”\n“Oh, that is the light in which you view it! Well, I must go in now; and you too: it darkens.”\nBut I stayed out a few minutes longer with Adèle and Pilot—ran a race with her, and played a game of battledore and shuttlecock. When we went in, and I had removed her bonnet and coat, I took her on my knee; kept her there an hour, allowing her to prattle as she liked: not rebuking even some little freedoms and trivialities into which she was apt to stray when much noticed, and which betrayed in her a superficiality of character, inherited probably from her mother, hardly congenial to an English mind. Still she had her merits; and I was disposed to appreciate all that was good in her to the utmost. I sought in her countenance and features a likeness to Mr. Rochester, but found none: no trait, no turn of expression announced relationship. It was a pity: if she could but have been proved to resemble him, he would have thought more of her.\nIt was not till after I had withdrawn to my own chamber for the night, that I steadily reviewed the tale Mr. Rochester had told me. As he had said, there was probably nothing at all extraordinary in the substance of the narrative itself: a wealthy Englishman’s passion for a French dancer, and her treachery to him, were every-day matters enough, no doubt, in society; but there was something decidedly strange in the paroxysm of emotion which had suddenly seized him when he was in the act of expressing the present contentment of his mood, and his newly revived pleasure in the old hall and its environs. I meditated wonderingly on this incident; but gradually quitting it, as I found it for the present inexplicable, I turned to the consideration of my master’s manner to myself. The confidence he had thought fit to repose in me seemed a tribute to my discretion: I regarded and accepted it as such. His deportment had now for some weeks been more uniform towards me than at the first. I never seemed in his way; he did not take fits of chilling hauteur: when he met me unexpectedly, the encounter seemed welcome; he had always a word and sometimes a smile for me: when summoned by formal invitation to his presence, I was honoured by a cordiality of reception that made me feel I really possessed the power to amuse him, and that these evening conferences were sought as much for his pleasure as for my benefit.\nI, indeed, talked comparatively little, but I heard him talk with relish. It was his nature to be communicative; he liked to open to a mind unacquainted with the world glimpses of its scenes and ways (I do not mean its corrupt scenes and wicked ways, but such as derived their interest from the great scale on which they were acted, the strange novelty by which they were characterised); and I had a keen delight in receiving the new ideas he offered, in imagining the new pictures he portrayed, and following him in thought through the new regions he disclosed, never startled or troubled by one noxious allusion.\nThe ease of his manner freed me from painful restraint: the friendly frankness, as correct as cordial, with which he treated me, drew me to him. I felt at times as if he were my relation rather than my master: yet he was imperious sometimes still; but I did not mind that; I saw it was his way. So happy, so gratified did I become with this new interest added to life, that I ceased to pine after kindred: my thin crescent-destiny seemed to enlarge; the blanks of existence were filled up; my bodily health improved; I gathered flesh and strength.\nAnd was Mr. Rochester now ugly in my eyes? No, reader: gratitude, and many associations, all pleasurable and genial, made his face the object I best liked to see; his presence in a room was more cheering than the brightest fire. Yet I had not forgotten his faults; indeed, I could not, for he brought them frequently before me. He was proud, sardonic, harsh to inferiority of every description: in my secret soul I knew that his great kindness to me was balanced by unjust severity to many others. He was moody, too; unaccountably so; I more than once, when sent for to read to him, found him sitting in his library alone, with his head bent on his folded arms; and, when he looked up, a morose, almost a malignant, scowl blackened his features. But I believed that his moodiness, his harshness, and his former faults of morality (I say former, for now he seemed corrected of them) had their source in some cruel cross of fate. I believed he was naturally a man of better tendencies, higher principles, and purer tastes than such as circumstances had developed, education instilled, or destiny encouraged. I thought there were excellent materials in him; though for the present they hung together somewhat spoiled and tangled. I cannot deny that I grieved for his grief, whatever that was, and would have given much to assuage it.",
          "paraphrase_gemini-2.5-flash-preview-04-17": "“No,” I replied, “Adèle isn’t accountable for her mother's shortcomings or yours. I care for her, and knowing she is, in a way, without parents—left by her mother and rejected by you, sir—I will feel even closer to her now. Why would I favor the spoiled darling of a rich family, who would likely view her governess as a nuisance, over a solitary little orphan who looks to her for friendship?”\n“Ah, so that is your perspective!” he said. “Very well, I must go inside now, and you too; it’s getting dark.”\nHowever, I stayed outside for a few more minutes with Adèle and Pilot. We ran together and played battledore and shuttlecock. When we eventually went in, and I had taken off her hat and coat, I sat her on my lap and kept her there for an hour, letting her talk freely. I didn't even scold her for some minor liberties and insignificant remarks she sometimes made when she was given attention, which revealed a rather shallow character, possibly inherited from her mother, and not quite suited to the English temperament. Still, she had her good points, and I was determined to fully appreciate them. I searched her face for any resemblance to Mr. Rochester but found none; no feature or expression suggested a family connection. It was a shame; if she had resembled him, he might have cared for her more.\nIt wasn’t until I had retired to my room for the night that I calmly reconsidered the story Mr. Rochester had shared. As he himself had noted, there was probably nothing truly remarkable about the story itself – a wealthy Englishman’s infatuation with a French dancer and her subsequent betrayal were undoubtedly common occurrences in society. However, there was something distinctly peculiar about the sudden, intense emotional reaction that overwhelmed him just as he was expressing his current contentment and his renewed pleasure in the old house and its surroundings. I pondered this incident with bewilderment, but finding it inexplicable for the moment, I turned my thoughts to how my employer treated me. The trust he chose to place in me seemed like an acknowledgement of my discretion, and I accepted and valued it as such. For some weeks now, his behavior towards me had been more consistent than it was initially. I never felt I was in his way; he didn't have periods of freezing arrogance. When we met unexpectedly, the encounter seemed welcome; he always had a kind word and sometimes a smile for me. When I was formally invited to see him, I was greeted with a warmth that made me feel I genuinely had the ability to entertain him, and that these evening discussions were desired as much for his enjoyment as for my instruction.\nIndeed, I spoke relatively little, but I enjoyed listening to him talk immensely. It was in his nature to be open; he liked showing a mind unfamiliar with the world glimpses of its events and customs (I mean not the corrupt or wicked parts, but those interesting because of their grand scale or unusual nature). And I took great pleasure in receiving the new perspectives he offered, imagining the new scenes he painted, and following his thoughts through the new territories he revealed, never disturbed or upset by any offensive implication.\nHis relaxed manner freed me from uncomfortable self-consciousness. The friendly honesty, proper yet warm, with which he treated me, drew me closer to him. At times, I felt he was more like a relative than my employer. Yet, he could still be demanding sometimes, but I didn't mind; I saw it was just his way. I became so happy and fulfilled by this new element in my life that I stopped longing for family. My seemingly narrow fate appeared to broaden; the empty parts of existence were filled. My physical health improved; I gained weight and strength.\nAnd was Mr. Rochester now unattractive in my eyes? No, reader. Gratitude and many pleasant, cheerful experiences made his face the sight I liked best, and his presence in a room was more comforting than the brightest fire. Yet, I hadn't forgotten his flaws; in fact, I couldn't, because he often displayed them. He was proud, sarcastic, and harsh towards people he considered inferior in any way. In my private thoughts, I knew his great kindness to me was offset by unfair harshness to many others. He was also moody, and inexplicably so. More than once, when summoned to read to him, I found him sitting alone in his library, head resting on his folded arms; and when he looked up, a sullen, almost malevolent, frown darkened his features. But I believed that his moodiness, his harshness, and his past moral mistakes (I say past, as he seemed reformed now) originated from some cruel turn of fortune. I believed he was naturally a man with better inclinations, higher principles, and purer tastes than those developed by circumstances, instilled by education, or encouraged by destiny. I thought he possessed excellent potential qualities, even though currently they seemed somewhat damaged and disordered. I cannot deny that I felt sorrow for his pain, whatever it was, and would have given a great deal to relieve it.",

I care about her, and now that I know she's essentially an orphan—abandoned by her mother and rejected by you—I feel even more attached to her.

Well, I need to go inside now, and you should too; it's getting dark.\"\n\nBut I lingered outside a little longer with Adèle and Pilot—racing and playing battledore and shuttlecock.

Nevertheless, she had good qualities, and I was eager to recognize all that was positive in her.

I pondered on this, though, finding it inexplicable for now, I set it aside to reflect on Mr. Rochester's behavior towards me. The trust he showed me felt like a compliment to my judgment, and I accepted it as such. Recently, he had behaved more consistently with me than before. I didn't feel like an inconvenience to him; he didn't become suddenly cold. Unexpected meetings always seemed welcome to him; he always had a kind word or even a smile for me. When I was formally invited to see him, he greeted me warmly enough to make me feel that I brought him enjoyment, and that these evening conversations were as much for his amusement as for my improvement.\n\nI usually talked little, but I enjoyed listening to him. He was naturally talkative, eager to give me insights into the world—by which I mean fascinating aspects, not wicked ones—and I took great pleasure in absorbing these new ideas, picturing what he described, and following his thoughts to new and exciting places, never upset by any inappropriate references.\n\nHis relaxed manner put me at ease. His friendly candor, both appropriate and warm, endeared him to me. At times, I felt he was almost like family rather than just my employer; he could still be commanding, but I didn't mind, recognizing it as part of his character. With this new interest in my life, I found myself much happier, no longer longing for relatives; life felt fuller, my physical health improved, and I grew stronger.\n\nDid I still find Mr. Rochester unattractive? No, dear reader: gratitude and countless pleasant memories made his face the one I liked to see most; his presence cheered me more than a glowing fire. Still, I hadn't forgotten his faults—nor could I, for he was always reminding me of them. He was proud, sarcastic, and severe toward those below him. Secretly, I was aware that his great kindness to me came with an unjust harshness to others. He was also moody; I sometimes found him alone in his library, brooding, and when he looked up, his expression could be sullen, even almost hostile. But I believed his moodiness, harshness, and past moral failings (which I think he has overcome) all stemmed from some misfortune. I thought him, at heart, a good man—naturally noble and pure, even if circumstance, upbringing, or fate had not encouraged these traits. I believed he had great potential, though currently it was somewhat marred. I pitied his unhappiness, whatever its cause, and would have done much to ease it."

Suppose he should be absent spring, summer, and autumn: how joyless sunshine and fine days will seem!”\nI hardly know whether I had slept or not after this musing; at any rate, I started wide awake on hearing a vague murmur, peculiar and lugubrious, which sounded, I thought, just above me. I wished I had kept my candle burning: the night was drearily dark; my spirits were depressed. I rose and sat up in bed, listening. The sound was hushed.\nI tried again to sleep; but my heart beat anxiously: my inward tranquillity was broken. The clock, far down in the hall, struck two. Just then it seemed my chamber-door was touched; as if fingers had swept the panels in groping a way along the dark gallery outside. I said, “Who is there?” Nothing answered. I was chilled with fear.\nAll at once I remembered that it might be Pilot, who, when the kitchen-door chanced to be left open, not unfrequently found his way up to the threshold of Mr. Rochester’s chamber: I had seen him lying there myself in the mornings. The idea calmed me somewhat: I lay down. Silence composes the nerves; and as an unbroken hush now reigned again through the whole house, I began to feel the return of slumber. But it was not fated that I should sleep that night. A dream had scarcely approached my ear, when it fled affrighted, scared by a marrow-freezing incident enough.\nThis was a demoniac laugh—low, suppressed, and deep—uttered, as it seemed, at the very keyhole of my chamber door. The head of my bed was near the door, and I thought at first the goblin-laugher stood at my bedside—or rather, crouched by my pillow: but I rose, looked round, and could see nothing; while, as I still gazed, the unnatural sound was reiterated: and I knew it came from behind the panels. My first impulse was to rise and fasten the bolt; my next, again to cry out, “Who is there?”\nSomething gurgled and moaned. Ere long, steps retreated up the gallery towards the third-storey staircase: a door had lately been made to shut in that staircase; I heard it open and close, and all was still.\n“Was that Grace Poole? and is she possessed with a devil?” thought I. Impossible now to remain longer by myself: I must go to Mrs. Fairfax. I hurried on my frock and a shawl; I withdrew the bolt and opened the door with a trembling hand. There was a candle burning just outside, and on the matting in the gallery. I was surprised at this circumstance: but still more was I amazed to perceive the air quite dim, as if filled with smoke; and, while looking to the right hand and left, to find whence these blue wreaths issued, I became further aware of a strong smell of burning.\nSomething creaked: it was a door ajar; and that door was Mr. Rochester’s, and the smoke rushed in a cloud from thence. I thought no more of Mrs. Fairfax; I thought no more of Grace Poole, or the laugh: in an instant, I was within the chamber. Tongues of flame darted round the bed: the curtains were on fire.

Will he be leaving again soon? Mrs. Fairfax mentioned he rarely stayed longer than two weeks at a time, yet he's now been residing here for eight weeks. If he departs, the change will be sorrowful. Imagine if he were gone through spring, summer, and autumn; how cheerless sunshine and pleasant days will seem!\" I'm unsure if I had actually slept after these thoughts; at any rate, I was jolted wide awake by a faint, peculiar, and mournful murmur that seemed to come from directly above me. I wished I had left my candle burning; the night was bleakly dark, and my spirits felt low. Getting up, I sat listening in bed. The sound ceased. I attempted to sleep again, but my heart pounded with anxiety; my inner calm was shattered. The clock, chiming distantly in the hall, struck two. Just then, it felt as though my bedroom door was being touched, as if fingers were feeling their way along the panels in the dark corridor outside. I asked, \"Who's there?\" There was no response. Fear sent a chill through me. Suddenly, I remembered it might be Pilot; sometimes, when the kitchen door happened to be left open, he would often make his way up to lie by Mr. Rochester's chamber door; I had seen him there myself in the mornings. This thought somewhat soothed me, and I lay back down. Silence helps calm the nerves, and as a complete hush settled over the house again, I began to feel sleep returning. However, I was not destined to sleep that night. A dream had barely begun when it was startled away, scared off by a truly bone-chilling incident. This was a devilish laugh – low, stifled, and deep – which seemed to come right from the keyhole of my door. My headboard was close to the door, and at first, I thought the fiendish laughter was beside my bed, or even crouching by my pillow. But I rose, looked around, and saw nothing. As I continued to look, the unnatural sound was repeated, and I knew it was coming from behind the wall panels. My initial instinct was to get up and secure the bolt; my next was to again call out, \"Who's there?\" Something gurgled and moaned. Soon after, footsteps retreated up the corridor towards the staircase leading to the third floor. A door had recently been added to enclose that staircase; I heard it open and close, and then all was quiet. \"Was that Grace Poole? And is she possessed?\" I wondered. It was impossible to remain alone any longer; I had to go to Mrs. Fairfax. I quickly put on my dress and a shawl, drew back the bolt, and opened the door with a trembling hand. To my surprise, a candle was burning just outside, on the matting in the corridor. I was startled by this, but even more so when I saw the air was quite hazy, as if filled with smoke. As I looked left and right, trying to find where the blue trails were coming from, I also noticed a strong smell of burning. A sound of creaking: it was a door slightly open, and that door was Mr. Rochester's. A cloud of smoke poured out from there. I thought no more of Mrs. Fairfax; I thought no more of Grace Poole or the laugh. In an instant, I was inside the room. Tongues of flame were leaping around the bed; the curtains were on fire.

Mrs. Fairfax said he rarely stayed more than two weeks at a time, but he’s been here for eight weeks now. If he leaves, it will be such a sad change. If he’s gone through the whole spring, summer, and autumn, the bright days will feel empty.” I drifted into a restless state and wasn’t sure if I’d actually slept when suddenly I was startled awake by a strange, mournful noise, which I thought came from directly above me. I regretted not keeping my candle lit—the darkness felt oppressive, and I was uneasy. I sat up and listened, but the sound faded away. I tried to sleep again, but my heart was uneasy and my peace was disturbed. The clock down the hall chimed two. At that moment, I thought I heard someone brushing against my door, as if feeling the panels in the darkness. I called out, “Who is there?” but got no reply. Fear chilled me. Then I remembered it could just be Pilot, who sometimes wandered upstairs when the kitchen door was left open—I’d seen him there in the mornings before. This thought reassured me, so I lay back down. The quiet gradually soothed my nerves, and as the house went silent, I felt sleep coming on. But that night was not meant for rest. I was barely drifting off when something startled me—an eerie, muffled, and deep laugh, right at my door. My bed was near the door, and for a moment I imagined the laughter was right by my pillow. But I got up and looked around: there was nothing there. Still, I heard the strange laugh again, this time clearly coming from behind the door. My first urge was to lock it; then I called out again, “Who is there?” Something made a gurgling, moaning sound. Soon I heard footsteps retreating up the hallway toward the staircase leading to the third floor, then a door open and shut, and everything went quiet. I wondered if it was Grace Poole and if she was somehow possessed. I couldn’t stay alone—so I hurriedly put on a dress and shawl, unlocked my door, and stepped out, my hand shaking. There was a candle burning outside on the hall mat, which surprised me, and the air was filled with smoke. Looking around for the source, I smelled burning. A door creaked open—it was Mr. Rochester’s—and smoke poured out. Forgetting all about Mrs. Fairfax, Grace Poole, or the laugh, I rushed into his room. Flames were climbing around the bed and the curtains were on fire. In the midst of the smoke and flames, Mr. Rochester lay sound asleep, unmoving."

I heaved them up, deluged the bed and its occupant, flew back to my own room, brought my own water-jug, baptized the couch afresh, and, by God’s aid, succeeded in extinguishing the flames which were devouring it.\nThe hiss of the quenched element, the breakage of a pitcher which I flung from my hand when I had emptied it, and, above all, the splash of the shower-bath I had liberally bestowed, roused Mr. Rochester at last.

Now run!”\nI did run; I brought the candle which still remained in the gallery. He took it from my hand, held it up, and surveyed the bed, all blackened and scorched, the sheets drenched, the carpet round swimming in water.\n“What is it? and who did it?” he asked.\nI briefly related to him what had transpired: the strange laugh I had heard in the gallery: the step ascending to the third storey; the smoke,—the smell of fire which had conducted me to his room; in what state I had found matters there, and how I had deluged him with all the water I could lay hands on.\nHe listened very gravely; his face, as I went on, expressed more concern than astonishment; he did not immediately speak when I had concluded.",

I lifted them, poured the water over the bed and the person in it, ran back to my room, fetched my own water jug, doused the bed again, and, with divine assistance, managed to put out the flames that were consuming it. The sound of the fire being extinguished, the noise of a pitcher I dropped after emptying it, and especially the splash from the generous soaking I’d given him, finally roused Mr. Rochester. Although it was dark now, I knew he was awake because I heard him loudly cursing when he found himself lying in a puddle. “Is there a flood?” he exclaimed. “No, sir,” I answered; “but there was a fire; please get up; you are completely soaked now; I will bring you a candle.” “In the name of all the little folk in Christendom, is that Jane Eyre?” he demanded. “What have you done to me, you witch, you sorceress? Is anyone else in the room with you? Did you plot to drown me?” “I will bring you a candle, sir; and, for heaven’s sake, get up. Someone has planned something; you must discover who and what it is without delay.” “Fine!

And who did it?” he inquired. I briefly told him what had occurred: the strange laugh I had heard in the gallery; the sound of footsteps going up to the third floor; the smoke—the smell of fire that had led me to his room; the state in which I had found things there, and how I had covered him with all the water I could find.

The sound of the water hissing as it smothered the fire, the crash of the jug I tossed aside after emptying it, and the thorough soaking finally woke Mr. Rochester. Even in the darkness, I could tell he was awake because I heard him angrily cursing about being soaked through. He demanded if there was a flood. I told him there had been a fire and urged him to get up, saying I would fetch a candle now that he was out of danger. He asked incredulously if it was me, Jane Eyre, who had doused him, and wondered if someone else was in the room or if I was trying to drown him. I repeated that I would fetch a candle and insisted that he get up, suggesting someone had tried something nefarious and he needed to investigate. He said he would get dressed and told me not to bring the candle until he was done, then sent me off once he found his dressing gown. I hurried to bring the candle from the hallway, and he examined the bedraggled scene: the scorched and soaked bed, and the waterlogged carpet. He asked what had happened and who was responsible. I gave him a quick rundown: hearing a strange laugh, footsteps upstairs, the smell and smoke that led me to his room, and what I found there, including how I threw all the water I could find onto everything. He listened intently, looking more worried than surprised, and after I finished, he did not speak right away."

He passed up the gallery very softly, unclosed the staircase door with as little noise as possible, shut it after him, and the last ray vanished. I was left in total darkness. I listened for some noise, but heard nothing. A very long time elapsed. I grew weary: it was cold, in spite of the cloak; and then I did not see the use of staying, as I was not to rouse the house. I was on the point of risking Mr. Rochester’s displeasure by disobeying his orders, when the light once more gleamed dimly on the gallery wall, and I heard his unshod feet tread the matting. “I hope it is he,” thought I, “and not something worse.”\nHe re-entered, pale and very gloomy. “I have found it all out,” said he, setting his candle down on the washstand; “it is as I thought.”\n“How, sir?”\nHe made no reply, but stood with his arms folded, looking on the ground. At the end of a few minutes he inquired in rather a peculiar tone—\n“I forget whether you said you saw anything when you opened your chamber door.”\n“No, sir, only the candlestick on the ground.”\n“But you heard an odd laugh? You have heard that laugh before, I should think, or something like it?”\n“Yes, sir: there is a woman who sews here, called Grace Poole,—she laughs in that way. She is a singular person.”\n“Just so. Grace Poole—you have guessed it. She is, as you say, singular—very. Well, I shall reflect on the subject. Meantime, I am glad that you are the only person, besides myself, acquainted with the precise details of to-night’s incident. You are no talking fool: say nothing about it. I will account for this state of affairs” (pointing to the bed): “and now return to your own room. I shall do very well on the sofa in the library for the rest of the night. It is near four:—in two hours the servants will be up.”\n“Good-night, then, sir,” said I, departing.\nHe seemed surprised—very inconsistently so, as he had just told me to go.\n“What!” he exclaimed, “are you quitting me already, and in that way?”\n“You said I might go, sir.”\n“But not without taking leave; not without a word or two of acknowledgment and good-will: not, in short, in that brief, dry fashion. Why, you have saved my life!—snatched me from a horrible and excruciating death! and you walk past me as if we were mutual strangers! At least shake hands.”\nHe held out his hand; I gave him mine: he took it first in one, then in both his own.\n“You have saved my life: I have a pleasure in owing you so immense a debt. I cannot say more. Nothing else that has being would have been tolerable to me in the character of creditor for such an obligation: but you: it is different;—I feel your benefits no burden, Jane.”\nHe paused; gazed at me: words almost visible trembled on his lips,—but his voice was checked.\n“Good-night again, sir. There is no debt, benefit, burden, obligation, in the case.”\n“I knew,” he continued, “you would do me good in some way, at some time;—I saw it in your eyes when I first beheld you: their expression and smile did not”—(again he stopped)—“did not” (he proceeded hastily) “strike delight to my very inmost heart so for nothing. People talk of natural sympathies; I have heard of good genii: there are grains of truth in the wildest fable. My cherished preserver, good-night!”\nStrange energy was in his voice, strange fire in his look.\n“I am glad I happened to be awake,” I said: and then I was going.\n“What! you will go?”\n“I am cold, sir.”\n“Cold? Yes,—and standing in a pool! Go, then, Jane; go!” But he still retained my hand, and I could not free it. I bethought myself of an expedient.\n“I think I hear Mrs. Fairfax move, sir,” said I.\n“Well, leave me:” he relaxed his fingers, and I was gone.\nI regained my couch, but never thought of sleep. Till morning dawned I was tossed on a buoyant but unquiet sea, where billows of trouble rolled under surges of joy. I thought sometimes I saw beyond its wild waters a shore, sweet as the hills of Beulah; and now and then a freshening gale, wakened by hope, bore my spirit triumphantly towards the bourne: but I could not reach it, even in fancy—a counteracting breeze blew off land, and continually drove me back. Sense would resist delirium: judgment would warn passion. Too feverish to rest, I rose as soon as day dawned.",

He sharply refused, asking why on earth I would call her and what she could possibly do, telling me to let her sleep undisturbed. I then offered to fetch Leah, John, and his wife. He stopped me immediately, telling me to stay put. He pointed out I had a shawl, but if that wasn't enough, I could use his cloak nearby. He helped me wrap it around myself and told me to sit in the armchair and place my feet on the stool to keep them dry. He informed me he would be leaving for a few minutes, taking the candle, and that I should remain exactly where I was until he returned, keeping perfectly quiet. He needed to go up to the second floor. He reiterated that I must not move or call anyone. He left, and I watched the light diminish. He moved very quietly along the corridor, opened the staircase door with minimal sound, closed it behind him, and the last bit of light vanished, leaving me in complete darkness. I listened but heard nothing. A long time passed, and I grew tired. Despite the cloak, it was cold, and I questioned the point of staying if I wasn't supposed to wake anyone. I was on the verge of disobeying Mr. Rochester, despite the potential for his displeasure, when the light dimly reappeared on the gallery wall, and I heard his bare feet on the matting. I hoped it was him, not something worse. He returned, looking pale and very serious. \"I've discovered everything,\" he said, putting the candle on the washstand. \"It's just as I suspected.\" \"How, sir?\" I asked. He didn't answer, but stood with his arms crossed, looking at the floor. After a few moments, he asked in a peculiar tone, \"Did you say you saw anything when you opened your bedroom door? I forget.\" \"No, sir, only the candlestick on the floor,\" I replied. \"But you heard a strange laugh? You've likely heard that laugh before, or something similar?\" he probed. \"Yes, sir,\" I confirmed, \"There's a woman who sews here named Grace Poole; she laughs that way. She's quite an unusual person.\" \"Precisely. Grace Poole—you've figured it out. She is, as you said, unusual—very. Well, I will think about this. In the meantime, I'm glad you're the only person besides myself who knows the exact details of what happened tonight. You aren't a careless talker, so keep it to yourself. I will explain this situation\" (gesturing towards the bed). \"Now go back to your room. I'll manage perfectly well on the library sofa for the rest of the night. It's nearly four; the servants will be up in two hours.\" \"Good-night, then, sir,\" I said as I began to leave. He seemed surprised—quite inconsistently, given he'd just told me to go. \"What!\" he exclaimed, \"Are you leaving me already, and like that?\" \"You told me I could go, sir,\" I explained. \"But not without saying goodbye; not without a word or two of thanks and good wishes; not, in short, in such a brief, cold manner. Why, you saved my life! Pulled me back from a terrible and agonizing death! And you walk past me as if we barely know each other! At least shake hands.\" He offered his hand; I gave him mine. He took it first in one hand, then in both of his. \"You've saved my life. I am pleased to owe you such a tremendous debt. I cannot say more. No other living soul could have been a welcome creditor for such a service, but you—it's different. I don't feel burdened by your help, Jane.\" He paused, gazing at me. Words seemed to tremble on his lips, almost visible, but his voice failed him. \"Good-night again, sir. There's no debt, favour, burden, or obligation involved,\" I insisted. \"I knew,\" he continued, \"you would do me good somehow, someday. I saw it in your eyes when I first saw you; their expression and smile didn't—\" (he stopped again) \"didn't\" (he rushed on) \"strike delight deep into my heart for no reason. People speak of natural connections; I've heard of helpful spirits; there's some truth even in the wildest tales. My cherished rescuer, good-night!\" His voice held strange intensity, his gaze strange fire. \"I'm glad I happened to be awake,\" I said, and started to go again. \"What! You are going?\" he pressed. \"I'm cold, sir.\" \"Cold? Yes—and standing in water! Go, then, Jane; go!\" But he still held my hand, and I couldn't free it. I thought of a way. \"I think I hear Mrs. Fairfax moving, sir,\" I said. \"Well, leave me,\" he said, loosening his grip, and I was free to leave. I returned to my bed but had no thought of sleep. Until morning broke, I felt like I was on a turbulent, restless sea, where waves of trouble rolled beneath swells of joy. Sometimes I imagined seeing a distant shore beyond the wild waters, as beautiful as the hills of Beulah, and now and then, a refreshing wind, stirred by hope, carried my spirit triumphantly towards that destination. But I couldn't reach it, not even in my imagination—a contrary breeze blew from the land, constantly pushing me back. My common sense resisted my feverish excitement; my judgment warned my emotions. Too agitated to rest, I got up as soon as dawn appeared.",

She can't help; let her sleep.\"\n\"Maybe I'll get Leah, or wake John and his wife.\"\n\"No, don't bother — just stay quiet. You're wearing a shawl, but if you're cold, use my cloak over there; wrap it around yourself and sit in the armchair. Here, I'll put it on you. Now put your feet on the stool to keep them dry. I'm going to step away for a bit and take the candle. Stay put until I return and be very quiet. I have to check something on the next floor. Don't move or call anyone.\"\n\nHe left, and I watched the candle’s light disappear as he moved quietly along the gallery, opened the staircase door with barely any sound, and closed it behind him, leaving me in complete darkness. I listened hard, but heard nothing. Time dragged on, and I grew cold and tired, even with the cloak. Since I wasn’t supposed to wake anyone, I didn’t see the point in staying. I was about to risk angering Mr. Rochester by ignoring his instructions when finally the light returned faintly along the gallery, and I heard his quiet footsteps. I hoped it was him—and nothing worse.\n\nHe returned, looking pale and grim. “I figured everything out,” he said, putting his candle on the washstand. “Just as I suspected.”\n“Really, sir?” I asked.\nHe didn’t answer at first, just stood with his arms folded, gazing at the floor. After a moment, he asked, sounding strange,\n“I forget, when you opened your bedroom door, did you see anything?”\n“No, sir; just the candlestick on the ground.”\n“But you heard a strange laugh? You’ve heard that laugh before?”\n“Yes, sir. There's a seamstress here named Grace Poole—she laughs like that. She’s an odd woman.”\n“Exactly. Grace Poole. You figured it out; she is very peculiar. I’ll think about all this. In the meantime, I’m glad only you and I know the details of what happened tonight. You can be discreet: say nothing about it. I’ll take responsibility for the state of things in here,” he said, pointing to the bed. “Now, go back to your room. I’ll sleep on the library sofa for the rest of the night. It’s nearly four in the morning; in two hours the servants will be up.”\n\n“Goodnight, sir,” I said as I left.\nHe seemed surprised—odd, since he’d just told me to go.\n“What! Leaving me already, and like that?”\n“You said I could go, sir.”\n“But not so abruptly, without a word or any warmth. You saved my life—from a terrible death!—and now you walk away as if we’re strangers! Please, shake my hand.”\nHe offered his hand, and I took it; first with one hand, then both of his.\n“You’ve saved my life. I’m glad to owe you so much. I feel differently about this debt with you; it feels like no burden. Thank you, Jane.”\nHe paused, looking at me; words hovered on his lips, but he stopped himself.\n\n“Goodnight again, sir. You owe me nothing.”\n“I knew you’d help me somehow, someday; I saw it in your eyes when we first met. Their look and smile weren’t meaningless.” Again he paused, then continued quickly, “People talk about natural sympathies; I’ve heard of guardian spirits. Even wild stories have some truth. Thank you, my cherished savior—goodnight!”\nHis words and expression were intense and passionate.\n“I’m simply glad I was awake,” I replied, preparing to go.\n“What! are you going?”\n“I’m cold, sir.”\n“Cold? In that case, and standing in a puddle, go, Jane!” But he still held on to my hand and wouldn’t let go. I thought of a way out.\n“I think I hear Mrs. Fairfax stirring, sir,” I said.\n“Fine, you can go,” he said, letting me loose, and I left.\n\nI returned to my bed, but couldn’t sleep. Restlessly, I tossed in anxiety and troubled happiness until morning. Sometimes I thought I could see a sweet, hopeful shore beyond the turbulent sea in my mind, and hope would lift my spirits, but reality always brought me back. My reason restrained my feelings. Too restless to sleep, I got up as soon as daylight appeared."

          "text_segment": "I both wished and feared to see Mr. Rochester on the day which followed this sleepless night: I wanted to hear his voice again, yet feared to meet his eye. During the early part of the morning, I momentarily expected his coming; he was not in the frequent habit of entering the schoolroom, but he did step in for a few minutes sometimes, and I had the impression that he was sure to visit it that day.\nBut the morning passed just as usual: nothing happened to interrupt the quiet course of Adèle’s studies; only soon after breakfast, I heard some bustle in the neighbourhood of Mr. Rochester’s chamber, Mrs. Fairfax’s voice, and Leah’s, and the cook’s—that is, John’s wife—and even John’s own gruff tones. There were exclamations of “What a mercy master was not burnt in his bed!” “It is always dangerous to keep a candle lit at night.” “How providential that he had presence of mind to think of the water-jug!” “I wonder he waked nobody!” “It is to be hoped he will not take cold with sleeping on the library sofa,” &c.\nTo much confabulation succeeded a sound of scrubbing and setting to rights; and when I passed the room, in going downstairs to dinner, I saw through the open door that all was again restored to complete order; only the bed was stripped of its hangings. Leah stood up in the window-seat, rubbing the panes of glass dimmed with smoke. I was about to address her, for I wished to know what account had been given of the affair: but, on advancing, I saw a second person in the chamber—a woman sitting on a chair by the bedside, and sewing rings to new curtains. That woman was no other than Grace Poole.\nThere she sat, staid and taciturn-looking, as usual, in her brown stuff gown, her check apron, white handkerchief, and cap. She was intent on her work, in which her whole thoughts seemed absorbed: on her hard forehead, and in her commonplace features, was nothing either of the paleness or desperation one would have expected to see marking the countenance of a woman who had attempted murder, and whose intended victim had followed her last night to her lair, and (as I believed), charged her with the crime she wished to perpetrate. I was amazed—confounded. She looked up, while I still gazed at her: no start, no increase or failure of colour betrayed emotion, consciousness of guilt, or fear of detection. She said “Good morning, Miss,” in her usual phlegmatic and brief manner; and taking up another ring and more tape, went on with her sewing.",
          "paraphrase_gemini-2.5-flash-preview-04-17": "The day after that sleepless night, I felt a mix of anticipation and apprehension about seeing Mr. Rochester. I longed to hear his voice again but was hesitant to look him in the eye. Throughout the early part of the morning, I kept expecting him to appear. He didn't often visit the schoolroom, but he occasionally stopped by for a few minutes, and I had a strong feeling he would do so today.\nHowever, the morning proceeded just as usual, with nothing disturbing the routine of Adele's lessons. The only unusual thing was, shortly after breakfast, I heard a commotion near Mr. Rochester's room. I could hear the voices of Mrs. Fairfax, Leah, the cook (John's wife), and even John's rough voice. They were exclaiming things like, \"It's a miracle master wasn't burned alive in his bed!\" \"It's always risky leaving a candle lit at night.\" \"How fortunate he was quick-witted enough to think of using the water jug!\" \"I can't believe he didn't wake anyone!\" \"Hopefully, he won't catch a cold from sleeping on the library sofa,\" and similar remarks.\nAfter a lot of chatter, I heard sounds of cleaning and tidying up. When I went downstairs for dinner and passed the room, I saw through the open door that everything was back in perfect order, except the bed no longer had its curtains. Leah was standing on the window seat, wiping the smoke-stained glass. I was about to speak to her, wanting to know what explanation was being given for the incident, but as I stepped closer, I noticed a second person in the room. It was a woman sitting on a chair by the bed, sewing rings onto new curtains. This woman was Grace Poole.\nShe sat there, looking as serious and quiet as ever, dressed in her usual brown dress, checked apron, white handkerchief, and cap. She was completely focused on her sewing, her mind seemingly absorbed in the work. On her stern forehead and ordinary face, there was no trace of the paleness or desperation one might expect from a woman who had tried to commit murder, whose intended victim had (as I believed) followed her to her room the previous night and accused her of the crime she planned. I was astonished and confused. She looked up while I was still staring at her. There was no sudden movement, no change in her complexion to show emotion, awareness of guilt, or fear of being caught. She simply said, \"Good morning, Miss,\" in her typically calm and brief way, then picked up another ring and more tape and went back to her sewing.",
          "paraphrase_gpt-4.1-2025-04-14": "After a sleepless night, I felt both anxious and eager to see Mr. Rochester the next day: I longed to hear him speak, but was nervous about meeting his gaze. Throughout the early morning, I repeatedly thought he might appear—though he rarely came into the schoolroom, he occasionally did for a short while, and I was convinced he would do so that day. Nevertheless, the morning unfolded as it always did—Adèle's lessons carried on without disturbance. Shortly after breakfast, however, I heard a commotion near Mr. Rochester’s room. Mrs. Fairfax, Leah, the cook (John’s wife), and even John himself were there, all talking. They were saying things like, \"It's a miracle the master wasn't burned in his bed!\" \"It's risky to leave a candle burning overnight.\" \"Thank goodness he thought to use the water-jug!\" and \"Surprising no one woke up!\" as well as wishing he wouldn't catch cold after having to sleep on the library sofa.\n\nAfter their conversation, I could hear cleaning noises, things being restored to normal. On my way down to lunch, I glanced through the open door of Mr. Rochester’s room, noting that order had returned—apart from the missing bedhangings. Leah was polishing the smoke-stained window glass. I intended to ask her about what had happened, but noticed a second figure—a woman seated by the bed, attaching rings to new curtains. It was Grace Poole.\n\nShe sat there, quiet and composed as always, dressed in her brown dress, checkered apron, white scarf, and cap. She seemed utterly focused on her sewing, with no sign of paleness or agitation that would suggest guilt—a surprising thing, since I believed she had tried to murder Mr. Rochester and had been confronted by him the night before. I was stunned and could hardly believe it. She glanced up at me, but her face showed no alarm, no change in color, no hint of fear or guilt. Calmly, she greeted me as usual, then continued her work without pause."

          "text_segment": "“I will put her to some test,” thought I: “such absolute impenetrability is past comprehension.”\n“Good morning, Grace,” I said. “Has anything happened here? I thought I heard the servants all talking together a while ago.”\n“Only master had been reading in his bed last night; he fell asleep with his candle lit, and the curtains got on fire; but, fortunately, he awoke before the bed-clothes or the wood-work caught, and contrived to quench the flames with the water in the ewer.”\n“A strange affair!” I said, in a low voice: then, looking at her fixedly—“Did Mr. Rochester wake nobody? Did no one hear him move?”\nShe again raised her eyes to me, and this time there was something of consciousness in their expression. She seemed to examine me warily; then she answered—\n“The servants sleep so far off, you know, Miss, they would not be likely to hear. Mrs. Fairfax’s room and yours are the nearest to master’s; but Mrs. Fairfax said she heard nothing: when people get elderly, they often sleep heavy.” She paused, and then added, with a sort of assumed indifference, but still in a marked and significant tone—“But you are young, Miss; and I should say a light sleeper: perhaps you may have heard a noise?”\n“I did,” said I, dropping my voice, so that Leah, who was still polishing the panes, could not hear me, “and at first I thought it was Pilot: but Pilot cannot laugh; and I am certain I heard a laugh, and a strange one.”\nShe took a new needleful of thread, waxed it carefully, threaded her needle with a steady hand, and then observed, with perfect composure—\n“It is hardly likely master would laugh, I should think, Miss, when he was in such danger: You must have been dreaming.”\n“I was not dreaming,” I said, with some warmth, for her brazen coolness provoked me. Again she looked at me; and with the same scrutinising and conscious eye.\n“Have you told master that you heard a laugh?” she inquired.\n“I have not had the opportunity of speaking to him this morning.”\n“You did not think of opening your door and looking out into the gallery?” she further asked.\nShe appeared to be cross-questioning me, attempting to draw from me information unawares. The idea struck me that if she discovered I knew or suspected her guilt, she would be playing of some of her malignant pranks on me; I thought it advisable to be on my guard.\n“On the contrary,” said I, “I bolted my door.”\n“Then you are not in the habit of bolting your door every night before you get into bed?”\n“Fiend! she wants to know my habits, that she may lay her plans accordingly!” Indignation again prevailed over prudence: I replied sharply, “Hitherto I have often omitted to fasten the bolt: I did not think it necessary. I was not aware any danger or annoyance was to be dreaded at Thornfield Hall: but in future” (and I laid marked stress on the words) “I shall take good care to make all secure before I venture to lie down.”\n“It will be wise so to do,” was her answer: “this neighbourhood is as quiet as any I know, and I never heard of the hall being attempted by robbers since it was a house; though there are hundreds of pounds’ worth of plate in the plate-closet, as is well known. And you see, for such a large house, there are very few servants, because master has never lived here much; and when he does come, being a bachelor, he needs little waiting on: but I always think it best to err on the safe side; a door is soon fastened, and it is as well to have a drawn bolt between one and any mischief that may be about. A deal of people, Miss, are for trusting all to Providence; but I say Providence will not dispense with the means, though He often blesses them when they are used discreetly.” And here she closed her harangue: a long one for her, and uttered with the demureness of a Quakeress.",
          "paraphrase_gemini-2.5-flash-preview-04-17": "I decided to test her, thinking, \"Such total lack of reaction is impossible to understand.\" I greeted her, \"Good morning, Grace. Did something happen? I thought I heard all the servants talking earlier.\" She replied, \"Master was reading in bed last night and fell asleep with his candle lit. The curtains caught fire, but luckily, he woke up before the bedding or wood caught and managed to put out the flames with the water from the ewer.\" I murmured, \"A strange event!\" Then, looking directly at her, I asked, \"Did Mr. Rochester not wake anyone? Did no one hear him?\" She looked up at me again, and this time there was a hint of awareness in her expression. She seemed to study me cautiously before answering, \"The servants sleep quite far away, Miss, so they likely wouldn't hear. Mrs. Fairfax's room and yours are closest to master's, but Mrs. Fairfax said she heard nothing. Older people often sleep soundly.\" She paused, then added with a seemingly casual but pointed tone, \"But you are young, Miss, and I imagine you're a light sleeper. Perhaps you heard a noise?\" \"I did,\" I said, lowering my voice so Leah, who was still cleaning the windows, couldn't hear. \"At first, I thought it was Pilot, but Pilot doesn't laugh, and I'm certain I heard a laugh, and it was a strange one.\" She picked up a new length of thread, waxed it carefully, threaded her needle steadily, and then commented with complete calm, \"It's not very likely master would be laughing when he was in such danger, I think, Miss. You must have been dreaming.\" \"I was not dreaming,\" I said, feeling a surge of annoyance at her cool insolence. She looked at me again with the same searching, knowing gaze. \"Have you told master that you heard a laugh?\" she asked. \"I haven't had a chance to speak to him this morning.\" \"You didn't consider opening your door and looking into the gallery?\" she pressed. She seemed to be questioning me closely, trying to trick me into revealing information. It occurred to me that if she realised I knew or suspected her involvement, she might try some of her malicious tricks on me. I thought it best to be cautious. \"On the contrary,\" I said, \"I bolted my door.\" \"So you don't usually bolt your door every night before bed?\" \"Villain!\" I thought, \"She wants to know my habits to plan her schemes!\" Indignation overcame caution again. I replied sharply, \"Until now, I often forgot to fasten the bolt; I didn't think it necessary. I wasn't aware of any danger or trouble to fear at Thornfield Hall, but from now on\" (and I emphasised these words) \"I will make sure everything is secure before I lie down.\" \"That would be a sensible thing to do,\" she replied. \"This area is as quiet as any I know, and I've never heard of anyone trying to rob the hall since it was built, even though there are hundreds of pounds worth of silver plate, as everyone knows. And you see, for such a large house, there are very few servants because master hasn't lived here much, and when he does come, being a bachelor, he doesn't need much waiting on. But I always think it's better to be safe than sorry; a door is quickly fastened, and it's wise to have a bolted door between you and any potential trouble. Many people, Miss, rely entirely on Providence, but I say Providence helps those who help themselves, though He often blesses careful efforts.\" With that, she finished her speech, which was unusually long for her and delivered with the solemnity of a Quaker.",
          "paraphrase_gpt-4.1-2025-04-14": "I decided to observe her closely and try to test her, as her complete lack of reaction seemed unfathomable. I greeted Grace in the morning and asked if anything had occurred, noting that I had earlier heard the servants talking. She answered that the master had been reading in bed and fell asleep with his candle still burning, which set the curtains on fire. Fortunately, he woke up before the rest of the bed or wood caught alight and managed to put out the flames using water. I quietly commented that it was a strange incident and then asked pointedly if Mr. Rochester had disturbed anyone, or if anyone heard him. Grace met my gaze with a more knowing look before responding that the servants’ rooms are too far away to hear anything, and Mrs. Fairfax, whose room is closest along with mine, claimed she heard nothing; older people tend to sleep soundly. She continued, adding that I, being young, might be a lighter sleeper and perhaps had heard something. I replied softly, so Leah couldn’t overhear, that I had indeed heard noise at first, suspecting it was Pilot, but realized it couldn’t be, as I was certain I heard a peculiar laugh. Unperturbed, Grace started threading her needle and replied calmly that it’s unlikely the master would laugh when in danger, suggesting I’d dreamt it. I insisted I was not dreaming, vexed by her imperturbable manner. She scrutinized me again, then asked if I’d told the master about the laugh. I replied I hadn’t had the chance yet. She then asked if I’d checked the hallway after hearing the sound. Sensing she was trying to uncover what I knew, I became cautious. I answered that, in fact, I had bolted my door. Grace inquired if I did so every night, which made me suspect she wanted to learn my habits for her own purposes. Irritated, I replied firmly that I had not always fastened the door, as I hadn’t thought it necessary until now, but that I certainly would make sure to secure it in the future. Grace agreed that this was wise, adding that although the area is peaceful and the house has never been robbed—despite its valuables and limited staff—it is always safer to lock up, as even Providence favors those who take sensible precautions. With that, she finished her unusually long and serious speech."

He had almost as much as declared his conviction of her criminality last night: what mysterious cause withheld him from accusing her? Why had he enjoined me, too, to secrecy? It was strange: a bold, vindictive, and haughty gentleman seemed somehow in the power of one of the meanest of his dependents; so much in her power, that even when she lifted her hand against his life, he dared not openly charge her with the attempt, much less punish her for it.\nHad Grace been young and handsome, I should have been tempted to think that tenderer feelings than prudence or fear influenced Mr. Rochester in her behalf; but, hard-favoured and matronly as she was, the idea could not be admitted. “Yet,” I reflected, “she has been young once; her youth would be contemporary with her master’s: Mrs. Fairfax told me once, she had lived here many years. I don’t think she can ever have been pretty; but, for aught I know, she may possess originality and strength of character to compensate for the want of personal advantages. Mr. Rochester is an amateur of the decided and eccentric: Grace is eccentric at least. What if a former caprice (a freak very possible to a nature so sudden and headstrong as his) has delivered him into her power, and she now exercises over his actions a secret influence, the result of his own indiscretion, which he cannot shake off, and dare not disregard?” But, having reached this point of conjecture, Mrs. Poole’s square, flat figure, and uncomely, dry, even coarse face, recurred so distinctly to my mind’s eye, that I thought, “No; impossible! my supposition cannot be correct. Yet,” suggested the secret voice which talks to us in our own hearts, “you are not beautiful either, and perhaps Mr. Rochester approves you: at any rate, you have often felt as if he did; and last night—remember his words; remember his look; remember his voice!”\nI well remembered all; language, glance, and tone seemed at the moment vividly renewed. I was now in the schoolroom; Adèle was drawing; I bent over her and directed her pencil. She looked up with a sort of start.\n“Qu’avez-vous, mademoiselle?” said she. “Vos doigts tremblent comme la feuille, et vos joues sont rouges: mais, rouges comme des cerises!”\n“I am hot, Adèle, with stooping!” She went on sketching; I went on thinking.\nI hastened to drive from my mind the hateful notion I had been conceiving respecting Grace Poole; it disgusted me. I compared myself with her, and found we were different. Bessie Leaven had said I was quite a lady; and she spoke truth—I was a lady. And now I looked much better than I did when Bessie saw me; I had more colour and more flesh, more life, more vivacity, because I had brighter hopes and keener enjoyments.\n“Evening approaches,” said I, as I looked towards the window. “I have never heard Mr. Rochester’s voice or step in the house to-day; but surely I shall see him before night: I feared the meeting in the morning; now I desire it, because expectation has been so long baffled that it is grown impatient.”\nWhen dusk actually closed, and when Adèle left me to go and play in the nursery with Sophie, I did most keenly desire it. I listened for the bell to ring below; I listened for Leah coming up with a message; I fancied sometimes I heard Mr. Rochester’s own tread, and I turned to the door, expecting it to open and admit him. The door remained shut; darkness only came in through the window. Still it was not late; he often sent for me at seven and eight o’clock, and it was yet but six. Surely I should not be wholly disappointed to-night, when I had so many things to say to him! I wanted again to introduce the subject of Grace Poole, and to hear what he would answer; I wanted to ask him plainly if he really believed it was she who had made last night’s hideous attempt; and if so, why he kept her wickedness a secret. It little mattered whether my curiosity irritated him; I knew the pleasure of vexing and soothing him by turns; it was one I chiefly delighted in, and a sure instinct always prevented me from going too far; beyond the verge of provocation I never ventured; on the extreme brink I liked well to try my skill. Retaining every minute form of respect, every propriety of my station, I could still meet him in argument without fear or uneasy restraint; this suited both him and me.",
          "paraphrase_gemini-2.5-flash-preview-04-17": "I remained utterly astonished by what seemed to me her incredible composure and highly mysterious deceitfulness when the cook came in. “Mrs. Poole,” the cook said, speaking to Grace, “the servants’ dinner is almost ready; will you come down?” “No; just place my small measure of porter and a bit of dessert on a tray, and I will take it up myself.” “Would you like some meat?” “Just a tiny piece, and a taste of cheese, that’s all.” “And the sago?” “Don’t worry about it for now; I’ll be coming downstairs before evening tea and I’ll make it myself then.” At this point, the cook turned to me, saying Mrs. Fairfax was waiting for me, so I left. I barely paid attention to Mrs. Fairfax’s description of the curtain fire during dinner, as I was so preoccupied trying to figure out Grace Poole’s puzzling nature, and even more so pondering her status at Thornfield and questioning why she hadn’t been arrested that morning, or at the very least, dismissed from her employer’s service. Last night, he had practically stated his certainty of her guilt; what unknown reason stopped him from accusing her? Why had he also told me to keep it a secret? It was odd: a brave, vengeful, and proud gentleman appeared to be somewhat under the control of one of his lowest employees; so much so, that even when she attempted to harm him, he didn’t dare to publicly accuse her of the act, much less punish her for it. If Grace had been young and attractive, I might have suspected that gentler feelings than caution or fear influenced Mr. Rochester’s actions regarding her; but, given her plain and mature appearance, that idea couldn’t be entertained. “However,” I thought, “she was young once; her youth would have coincided with her master’s. Mrs. Fairfax once mentioned she had been here for many years. I don’t believe she could ever have been pretty, but for all I know, she might possess originality and strength of character to make up for a lack of physical appeal. Mr. Rochester appreciates decisive and unusual personalities; Grace is certainly unusual. What if a past whim (an impulse quite likely for a nature as sudden and impulsive as his) has placed him under her control, and she now exerts a hidden influence over his actions, a consequence of his own mistake, which he cannot break free from and dares not ignore?” But, having reached this point of speculation, Mrs. Poole’s stout, flat figure and unattractive, harsh, even common face came back so clearly to my mind’s eye that I concluded, “No; impossible! My assumption cannot be right. Yet,” whispered the inner voice that speaks within our hearts, “you aren’t beautiful either, and perhaps Mr. Rochester approves of you; at any rate, you have often felt as if he did; and last night—remember his words; remember his look; remember his voice!” I recalled everything clearly; his language, gaze, and tone seemed vividly present at that moment. I was now in the classroom; Adèle was drawing; I leaned over her and guided her pencil. She looked up with a slight start. “What is wrong, miss?” she asked. “Your fingers are trembling like a leaf, and your cheeks are red—but, red like cherries!” “I am warm, Adèle, from bending down!” She resumed her drawing; I continued my thinking. I hurried to rid my mind of the unpleasant idea I had been considering about Grace Poole; it disgusted me. I compared myself to her and found we were different. Bessie Leaven had said I was quite a lady; and she was right—I was a lady. And now I looked much better than when Bessie saw me; I had more colour and fullness, more vitality, more spirit, because my hopes were brighter and my joys were keener. “Evening is approaching,” I remarked, looking towards the window. “I haven’t heard Mr. Rochester’s voice or footsteps in the house today; but surely I will see him before night. I dreaded meeting him this morning; now I wish for it, because the waiting has been so prolonged that it has become impatient.” When darkness actually fell, and Adèle left me to play in the nursery with Sophie, I did indeed intensely desire it. I listened for the bell ringing below; I listened for Leah coming up with a message; I sometimes imagined I heard Mr. Rochester’s own step, and I turned to the door, expecting it to open and let him in. The door stayed shut; only darkness entered through the window. Still, it wasn’t late; he often sent for me at seven or eight o’clock, and it was only six. Surely I wouldn’t be completely disappointed tonight, when I had so much I wanted to say to him! I wanted to bring up the topic of Grace Poole again and hear his answer; I wanted to ask him directly if he truly believed it was she who had made that dreadful attempt last night; and if so, why he was keeping her wickedness a secret. It hardly mattered if my curiosity annoyed him; I knew the pleasure of irritating and then calming him in turn; it was one I particularly enjoyed, and a reliable intuition always prevented me from going too far; I never ventured beyond the point of provocation; I liked to test my skill on the very edge. Maintaining every small detail of respect, every proper aspect of my position, I could still engage him in discussion without fear or uncomfortable restraint; this suited both him and me.",
          "paraphrase_gpt-4.1-2025-04-14": "I remained completely astonished by Grace Poole's extraordinary calmness and her mysterious dishonesty, when the cook came in and asked Grace to come down for the servants' dinner. Grace declined, asking instead for her meal to be sent up on a tray, specifying what she wanted and saying she would return later to prepare some sago herself. The cook then told me Mrs. Fairfax was waiting, so I left. Throughout dinner, I barely listened to Mrs. Fairfax’s explanation of the fire in the curtains; my mind was preoccupied with wondering about Grace Poole's secretive nature and her presence at Thornfield. I couldn't understand why she hadn't been fired or arrested after Mr. Rochester’s implied accusation the previous night, or why he asked me to keep quiet about it. It was odd that such a powerful man seemed under the sway of one of his lowliest employees, to the point of not punishing her openly after such a serious incident. If Grace had been attractive, I might have thought Mr. Rochester was influenced by affection, but given her plain appearance, that idea seemed impossible. Still, I wondered if some past mistake had given her power over him, explaining his reluctance to confront her. But when I considered her unremarkable looks again, the idea seemed implausible. Yet, an inner voice reminded me I wasn't beautiful either, and perhaps Mr. Rochester liked me nevertheless, especially considering his words and behavior the previous evening, which I remembered vividly. While in the schoolroom with Adèle drawing, she noticed my trembling hands and flushed cheeks, which I blamed on bending over her work. Ashamed of my unpleasant thoughts about Grace, I reassured myself of our differences and my own improved appearance and spirits since arriving at Thornfield. As evening approached, I realized Mr. Rochester had not been seen all day but hoped to see him before nightfall. As it got dark and Adèle left, I grew more eager to see him, listening for sounds of his coming. When he didn’t appear, I thought about all the things I wanted to discuss with him, particularly about Grace Poole and why he kept her actions secret, even though it might annoy him. I enjoyed our conversations and debates, always making sure not to push him too far, maintaining proper respect while still engaging him intellectually, a dynamic that suited us both."

She described her as tall with a well-formed upper body and sloping shoulders, a long and graceful neck, and a dark yet clear olive complexion. Her features were noble, and her eyes, large, black, and sparkling like her jewelry, reminded her somewhat of Mr. Rochester's.

Go! your folly sickens me. And you have derived pleasure from occasional tokens of preference—equivocal tokens shown by a gentleman of family and a man of the world to a dependent and a novice. How dared you? Poor stupid dupe!—Could not even self-interest make you wiser? You repeated to yourself this morning the brief scene of last night?—Cover your face and be ashamed! He said something in praise of your eyes, did he? Blind puppy! Open their bleared lids and look on your own accursed senselessness! It does good to no woman to be flattered by her superior, who cannot possibly intend to marry her; and it is madness in all women to let a secret love kindle within them, which, if unreturned and unknown, must devour the life that feeds it; and, if discovered and responded to, must lead, ignis-fatuus-like, into miry wilds whence there is no extrication.",

Once alone again, I reviewed the information I had gathered. I looked inward, examining my thoughts and emotions, and made a determined effort to force back any straying notions, which had wandered through the limitless, unmapped territory of imagination, into the secure realm of common sense. Holding myself accountable, I let my Memory present evidence of the hopes, desires, and feelings I had nurtured since the previous night—of the general state of mind I had allowed myself for nearly two weeks. Then Reason stepped forward and, in her quiet way, told a simple, truthful account, revealing how I had rejected reality and greedily embraced fantasy. Based on this, I reached the following conclusion about myself: that no one who had ever lived was a greater fool than Jane Eyre; that no more ridiculous simpleton had ever overindulged in pleasant lies and swallowed poison as if it were a sweet drink. \"You,\" I told myself, \"a favorite of Mr. Rochester's? You gifted with the ability to please him? You significant to him in any way? Stop! Your foolishness repulses me. And you took pleasure from occasional signs of favor—ambiguous hints shown by a well-born man of the world towards a dependent and a novice. How could you? You poor, stupid victim! Couldn't even looking out for yourself make you wiser? Did you replay this morning the brief scene from last night? Hide your face and be ashamed! He complimented your eyes, did he? You blind idiot! Open your misty eyes and see your own cursed lack of sense! Being flattered by your superior, who absolutely cannot intend to marry you, does no woman any good. And it is sheer madness for any woman to let a secret love start within them, which, if it isn't returned and remains unknown, will consume the life that harbors it. If it is discovered and reciprocated, like a misleading marsh-light, it must lead into muddy, wild places from which there is no escape.\n",

Left alone, I reconsidered what I had learned and examined my own feelings and thoughts, trying firmly to bring any wild fantasies back into control with reason. I judged myself, recalling the hopes and feelings I had indulged in for nearly two weeks, and with logic, recognized how I had ignored reality and chased after unrealistic dreams. I concluded that no one could be more foolish or more lost in fantasy than I, Jane Eyre, who had fed herself on sweet deceptions and mistaken them for happiness. I rebuked myself: Did I really believe I could be important to Mr. Rochester, or that I could please him? Such thoughts were foolish, and any pleasure I gained from his ambiguous gestures was naive, given our different social positions. I scolded myself for even recalling his compliments, feeling ashamed at my gullibility. I realized it is dangerous for any woman to be flattered by a man who could never marry her and madness to nurture a secret love that, if unreturned, will consume her, and if returned, could lead only to grief and ruin."

Mrs. Fairfax said she should not be surprised if he were to go straight from the Leas to London, and thence to the Continent, and not show his face again at Thornfield for a year to come; he had not unfrequently quitted it in a manner quite as abrupt and unexpected. When I heard this, I was beginning to feel a strange chill and failing at the heart. I was actually permitting myself to experience a sickening sense of disappointment; but rallying my wits, and recollecting my principles, I at once called my sensations to order; and it was wonderful how I got over the temporary blunder—how I cleared up the mistake of supposing Mr. Rochester’s movements a matter in which I had any cause to take a vital interest. Not that I humbled myself by a slavish notion of inferiority: on the contrary, I just said—\n“You have nothing to do with the master of Thornfield, further than to receive the salary he gives you for teaching his protégée, and to be grateful for such respectful and kind treatment as, if you do your duty, you have a right to expect at his hands. Be sure that is the only tie he seriously acknowledges between you and him; so don’t make him the object of your fine feelings, your raptures, agonies, and so forth. He is not of your order: keep to your caste, and be too self-respecting to lavish the love of the whole heart, soul, and strength, where such a gift is not wanted and would be despised.”\nI went on with my day’s business tranquilly; but ever and anon vague suggestions kept wandering across my brain of reasons why I should quit Thornfield; and I kept involuntarily framing advertisements and pondering conjectures about new situations: these thoughts I did not think to check; they might germinate and bear fruit if they could.\nMr. Rochester had been absent upwards of a fortnight, when the post brought Mrs. Fairfax a letter.\n“It is from the master,” said she, as she looked at the direction. “Now I suppose we shall know whether we are to expect his return or not.”\nAnd while she broke the seal and perused the document, I went on taking my coffee (we were at breakfast): it was hot, and I attributed to that circumstance a fiery glow which suddenly rose to my face. Why my hand shook, and why I involuntarily spilt half the contents of my cup into my saucer, I did not choose to consider.\n“Well, I sometimes think we are too quiet; but we run a chance of being busy enough now: for a little while at least,” said Mrs. Fairfax, still holding the note before her spectacles.\nEre I permitted myself to request an explanation, I tied the string of Adèle’s pinafore, which happened to be loose: having helped her also to another bun and refilled her mug with milk, I said, nonchalantly—\n“Mr. Rochester is not likely to return soon, I suppose?”\n“Indeed he is—in three days, he says: that will be next Thursday; and not alone either. I don’t know how many of the fine people at the Leas are coming with him: he sends directions for all the best bedrooms to be prepared; and the library and drawing-rooms are to be cleaned out; I am to get more kitchen hands from the George Inn, at Millcote, and from wherever else I can; and the ladies will bring their maids and the gentlemen their valets: so we shall have a full house of it.” And Mrs. Fairfax swallowed her breakfast and hastened away to commence operations.",
          "paraphrase_gemini-2.5-flash-preview-04-17": "A week went by without any word from Mr. Rochester; ten days passed, and he still had not returned. Mrs. Fairfax speculated that he might head straight from the Leas gathering to London and then to the Continent, potentially staying away from Thornfield for a full year, noting that he had often departed in such sudden ways before. Hearing this, I started to feel a strange coldness and weakness in my chest. I realized I was letting myself feel a painful sense of disappointment, but I quickly regained control of my thoughts and remembered my principles. It was surprisingly easy to overcome that temporary lapse and correct the error of assuming Mr. Rochester's movements were something I had any important reason to care about. It wasn't that I felt humbly inferior; rather, I told myself, “Your only connection to Thornfield's master is the salary he pays you for tutoring his ward, and you should be grateful for the respectful and kind treatment you have a right to expect if you perform your duties well. Be certain that is the only bond he truly acknowledges between you two, so don't focus your intense feelings, your joys, sorrows, and so forth, on him. He belongs to a different social rank than you; stick to your own place and have enough self-respect not to lavish the fullness of your love, spirit, and energy where such a gift is neither wanted nor would be valued.” I calmly resumed my daily tasks, but vague ideas about why I should leave Thornfield kept surfacing in my mind from time to time. I found myself constantly formulating potential job advertisements and considering new positions, thoughts I didn't try to suppress; I figured they could develop and yield results if they were capable. Mr. Rochester had been gone for over two weeks when the mail brought a letter for Mrs. Fairfax. “It’s from the master,” she announced, looking at the address. “Now I expect we'll find out whether he's coming back or not.” While she broke the seal and read the letter, I continued drinking my coffee during breakfast. It was hot, and I blamed the sudden rush of heat to my face on that. I chose not to think about why my hand trembled and why I accidentally poured half the contents of my cup into my saucer. “Well, sometimes I think we're too quiet, but we're likely to be quite busy now, at least for a little while,” Mrs. Fairfax remarked, still holding the note in front of her glasses. Before allowing myself to ask for details, I tied the bow on Adèle’s pinafore, which had come undone, and helped her to another roll, refilling her milk mug. Then I asked casually, “Mr. Rochester probably isn't returning soon, I suppose?” “Indeed he is,” she replied. “In three days, he says; that will be next Thursday. And he won’t be alone. I don’t know how many of the distinguished guests from the Leas will be accompanying him. He has sent instructions for all the best bedrooms to be made ready, and the library and drawing-rooms need cleaning. I have to hire more kitchen staff from the George Inn in Millcote and anywhere else I can find them. The ladies will bring their personal maids and the gentlemen their valets, so the house will be completely full.” After saying this, Mrs. Fairfax quickly finished her breakfast and hurried off to begin the preparations.",

Hearing this, I began to feel a cold disappointment, but quickly pulled myself together and reminded myself of my place. I told myself that my only connection to Mr. Rochester was my employment as Adèle’s governess, and the respectful treatment he gave me for doing my job well. I resolved not to let my feelings dwell on him, remembering the distance between our positions, and not to waste my affection where it was neither wanted nor appropriate.

Mrs. Fairfax remarked that our quiet days might soon be over, as the note instructed that many preparations needed to be made—more hands hired, rooms prepared, and staff enlisted—because Mr. Rochester would be back in three days, bringing several guests with him.

Three women were got to help; and such scrubbing, such brushing, such washing of paint and beating of carpets, such taking down and putting up of pictures, such polishing of mirrors and lustres, such lighting of fires in bedrooms, such airing of sheets and feather-beds on hearths, I never beheld, either before or since. Adèle ran quite wild in the midst of it: the preparations for company and the prospect of their arrival, seemed to throw her into ecstasies. She would have Sophie to look over all her “toilettes,” as she called frocks; to furbish up any that were “passées,” and to air and arrange the new. For herself, she did nothing but caper about in the front chambers, jump on and off the bedsteads, and lie on the mattresses and piled-up bolsters and pillows before the enormous fires roaring in the chimneys. From school duties she was exonerated: Mrs. Fairfax had pressed me into her service, and I was all day in the storeroom, helping (or hindering) her and the cook; learning to make custards and cheese-cakes and French pastry, to truss game and garnish desert-dishes.\nThe party were expected to arrive on Thursday afternoon, in time for dinner at six. During the intervening period I had no time to nurse chimeras; and I believe I was as active and gay as anybody—Adèle excepted. Still, now and then, I received a damping check to my cheerfulness; and was, in spite of myself, thrown back on the region of doubts and portents, and dark conjectures. This was when I chanced to see the third-storey staircase door (which of late had always been kept locked) open slowly, and give passage to the form of Grace Poole, in prim cap, white apron, and handkerchief; when I watched her glide along the gallery, her quiet tread muffled in a list slipper; when I saw her look into the bustling, topsy-turvy bedrooms,—just say a word, perhaps, to the charwoman about the proper way to polish a grate, or clean a marble mantelpiece, or take stains from papered walls, and then pass on. She would thus descend to the kitchen once a day, eat her dinner, smoke a moderate pipe on the hearth, and go back, carrying her pot of porter with her, for her private solace, in her own gloomy, upper haunt. Only one hour in the twenty-four did she pass with her fellow-servants below; all the rest of her time was spent in some low-ceiled, oaken chamber of the second storey: there she sat and sewed—and probably laughed drearily to herself,—as companionless as a prisoner in his dungeon.\nThe strangest thing of all was, that not a soul in the house, except me, noticed her habits, or seemed to marvel at them: no one discussed her position or employment; no one pitied her solitude or isolation. I once, indeed, overheard part of a dialogue between Leah and one of the charwomen, of which Grace formed the subject. Leah had been saying something I had not caught, and the charwoman remarked—\n“She gets good wages, I guess?”\n“Yes,” said Leah; “I wish I had as good; not that mine are to complain of,—there’s no stinginess at Thornfield; but they’re not one fifth of the sum Mrs. Poole receives. And she is laying by: she goes every quarter to the bank at Millcote. I should not wonder but she has saved enough to keep her independent if she liked to leave; but I suppose she’s got used to the place; and then she’s not forty yet, and strong and able for anything. It is too soon for her to give up business.”\n“She is a good hand, I daresay,” said the charwoman.\n“Ah!—she understands what she has to do,—nobody better,” rejoined Leah significantly; “and it is not every one could fill her shoes—not for all the money she gets.”\n“That it is not!” was the reply. “I wonder whether the master—”\nThe charwoman was going on; but here Leah turned and perceived me, and she instantly gave her companion a nudge.\n“Doesn’t she know?” I heard the woman whisper.\nLeah shook her head, and the conversation was of course dropped. All I had gathered from it amounted to this,—that there was a mystery at Thornfield; and that from participation in that mystery I was purposely excluded.",
          "paraphrase_gemini-2.5-flash-preview-04-17": "The next three days unfolded just as she had predicted, filled with activity. I had believed Thornfield's rooms were already perfectly clean and orderly, but apparently, I was incorrect. Three women were hired to help, and the extent of the cleaning was unprecedented in my experience: intense scrubbing, brushing, paint washing, carpet beating, taking down and rehanging pictures, polishing mirrors and light fixtures, lighting fires in bedrooms, and warming sheets and duvets by the hearths. Adèle became completely unrestrained amidst all this; the anticipation of visitors and their imminent arrival seemed to send her into fits of joy. She insisted Sophie examine all her 'toilettes' (as she called her dresses), to spruce up any that were 'worn out', and to air and arrange the new ones. For her part, Adèle did nothing but dance around the front rooms, leap onto and off the beds, and sprawl on the mattresses, piled-up bolsters, and pillows in front of the huge fires roaring in the fireplaces. She was excused from her lessons. Mrs. Fairfax enlisted my help, and I spent my entire day in the storeroom, assisting (or perhaps hindering) her and the cook. I learned to prepare custards, cheesecakes, and French pastries, to truss game birds, and decorate dessert platters.\n\nThe guests were expected on Thursday afternoon, arriving in time for dinner at six. During this interval, I had no opportunity for brooding or fanciful thoughts; in fact, I believe I was as energetic and cheerful as anyone, except for Adèle. Nevertheless, every so often, my good spirits were unexpectedly dampened, and I was involuntarily drawn back to my realm of uncertainties, premonitions, and somber suspicions. This occurred when I happened to see the door to the third-story staircase (which had been consistently locked recently) slowly open, allowing Grace Poole to emerge, looking proper in her neat cap, white apron, and neckerchief. I would watch her glide along the corridor, her quiet steps muffled by her soft slippers. I saw her glance into the bustling, chaotic bedrooms, perhaps offering a brief instruction to a cleaning woman on the proper way to polish a grate, clean a marble mantelpiece, or remove stains from wallpaper, and then move on. She would descend to the kitchen once daily, eat her meal, calmly smoke a pipe by the fire, and then return, carrying her stout ale for her private comfort in her somber upper dwelling. She spent only one hour out of twenty-four with the other servants downstairs; the rest of her time was spent in a low-ceilinged, oak-paneled room on the second floor. There she sat and sewed, likely laughing dismally to herself, as solitary as a prisoner in a dungeon.\n\nThe most peculiar aspect was that, apart from myself, no one else in the house seemed to notice or be surprised by her habits. No one discussed her position or duties, nor did anyone express pity for her solitude or isolation. However, on one occasion, I did overhear a portion of a conversation about Grace between Leah and one of the cleaning women. Leah had said something I didn't catch, and the charwoman commented—\n“I assume she earns good wages?”\n“Yes,” Leah replied, “I wish mine were as good; not that I have cause to complain—Thornfield is not stingy with pay—but they are not even one-fifth of what Mrs. Poole receives. And she is saving up; she visits the bank in Millcote every quarter. It wouldn't surprise me if she has saved enough to be independent should she choose to leave. But I suppose she has become accustomed to the place. Plus, she's not forty yet, and she's strong and capable of anything. It's too early for her to retire.”\n“I'm sure she's skilled at her job,” said the cleaning woman.\n“Ah, she certainly knows what she needs to do—no one does it better,” Leah rejoined pointedly, “and not everyone could manage her role—not even for all the money she gets.”\n“That’s true!” came the reply. “I wonder if the master—”\nThe charwoman was about to continue, but here Leah turned and saw me, immediately nudging her companion.\n“Does she not know?” I heard the woman whisper.\nLeah shook her head, and naturally, the conversation ceased. All I gleaned from this exchange was that Thornfield held a secret, and that I was intentionally being kept out of it.",
          "paraphrase_gpt-4.1-2025-04-14": "The three days were as busy as predicted. Although I initially thought Thornfield Hall was spotless and well-ordered, I soon realized I was wrong. Three extra women were hired to assist, and the level of cleaning and preparation was like nothing I had ever seen: scrubbing, brushing, washing paint, beating carpets, rearranging pictures, polishing mirrors and chandeliers, lighting fires in every bedroom, and airing out bedding in front of roaring hearths. Adèle was overjoyed by all the activity, thrilled about the guests’ upcoming arrival. She had Sophie check all her dresses, spruce up the old ones, and arrange the new. Adèle herself just danced around the rooms, jumped on beds, and lounged on the heaps of pillows and mattresses next to the blazing fires. She was excused from lessons, while Mrs. Fairfax had enlisted my help in the storeroom, so I spent my days assisting her and the cook, learning how to prepare fancy pastries and desserts, and help with game and garnishes.\n\nThe guests were due to arrive Thursday afternoon for dinner at six. In the meantime, I was so occupied I had no time for idle daydreams, and felt as energetic and cheerful as anyone, apart from Adèle. Still, at times, my happiness was disrupted, particularly when I noticed the door to the third-story staircase—formerly always locked—creak open to let Grace Poole pass. In her neat cap, apron, and kerchief, Grace would glide silently along the corridor, sometimes stopping at the chaotic bedrooms to offer advice to the cleaning women before heading downstairs. Each day, she would eat her meal in the kitchen, quietly smoke a pipe by the fire, and then return upstairs with her own pot of ale for company, spending almost all her time alone in a small, upper room, sewing and—perhaps—laughing to herself, as isolated as any prisoner.\n\nCuriously, I was the only person in the house who seemed to notice or wonder about Grace’s solitary habits; no one else discussed her role or pitied her loneliness. I once heard part of a conversation between Leah and a cleaning woman about Grace. The charwoman asked if Grace was well-paid, and Leah confirmed she was, wishing for such wages herself, though hers weren’t bad. She mentioned Grace saved her money and regularly deposited it in the bank, and that Grace could be independent if she left, but perhaps she simply liked Thornfield, was still young and strong, and not ready to stop working. The charwoman acknowledged Grace’s skill, and Leah agreed, implying Grace’s work was exceptional and not easily replaced, regardless of pay. Just as the charwoman was about to comment on ‘the master,’ Leah noticed me nearby and quickly ended the conversation. All I gleaned from this was that a mystery existed at Thornfield, one I was clearly not allowed to share in."

          "text_segment": "Thursday came: all work had been completed the previous evening; carpets were laid down, bed-hangings festooned, radiant white counterpanes spread, toilet tables arranged, furniture rubbed, flowers piled in vases: both chambers and saloons looked as fresh and bright as hands could make them. The hall, too, was scoured; and the great carved clock, as well as the steps and banisters of the staircase, were polished to the brightness of glass; in the dining-room, the sideboard flashed resplendent with plate; in the drawing-room and boudoir, vases of exotics bloomed on all sides.\nAfternoon arrived: Mrs. Fairfax assumed her best black satin gown, her gloves, and her gold watch; for it was her part to receive the company,—to conduct the ladies to their rooms, &c. Adèle, too, would be dressed: though I thought she had little chance of being introduced to the party that day at least. However, to please her, I allowed Sophie to apparel her in one of her short, full muslin frocks. For myself, I had no need to make any change; I should not be called upon to quit my sanctum of the schoolroom; for a sanctum it was now become to me,—“a very pleasant refuge in time of trouble.”\nIt had been a mild, serene spring day—one of those days which, towards the end of March or the beginning of April, rise shining over the earth as heralds of summer. It was drawing to an end now; but the evening was even warm, and I sat at work in the schoolroom with the window open.\n“It gets late,” said Mrs. Fairfax, entering in rustling state. “I am glad I ordered dinner an hour after the time Mr. Rochester mentioned; for it is past six now. I have sent John down to the gates to see if there is anything on the road: one can see a long way from thence in the direction of Millcote.” She went to the window. “Here he is!” said she. “Well, John” (leaning out), “any news?”\n“They’re coming, ma’am,” was the answer. “They’ll be here in ten minutes.”\nAdèle flew to the window. I followed, taking care to stand on one side, so that, screened by the curtain, I could see without being seen.\nThe ten minutes John had given seemed very long, but at last wheels were heard; four equestrians galloped up the drive, and after them came two open carriages. Fluttering veils and waving plumes filled the vehicles; two of the cavaliers were young, dashing-looking gentlemen; the third was Mr. Rochester, on his black horse, Mesrour, Pilot bounding before him; at his side rode a lady, and he and she were the first of the party. Her purple riding-habit almost swept the ground, her veil streamed long on the breeze; mingling with its transparent folds, and gleaming through them, shone rich raven ringlets.\n“Miss Ingram!” exclaimed Mrs. Fairfax, and away she hurried to her post below.\nThe cavalcade, following the sweep of the drive, quickly turned the angle of the house, and I lost sight of it. Adèle now petitioned to go down; but I took her on my knee, and gave her to understand that she must not on any account think of venturing in sight of the ladies, either now or at any other time, unless expressly sent for: that Mr. Rochester would be very angry, &c. “Some natural tears she shed” on being told this; but as I began to look very grave, she consented at last to wipe them.\nA joyous stir was now audible in the hall: gentlemen’s deep tones and ladies’ silvery accents blent harmoniously together, and distinguishable above all, though not loud, was the sonorous voice of the master of Thornfield Hall, welcoming his fair and gallant guests under its roof. Then light steps ascended the stairs; and there was a tripping through the gallery, and soft cheerful laughs, and opening and closing doors, and, for a time, a hush.\n“Elles changent de toilettes,” said Adèle; who, listening attentively, had followed every movement; and she sighed.\n“Chez maman,” said she, “quand il y avait du monde, je le suivais partout, au salon et à leurs chambres; souvent je regardais les femmes de chambre coiffer et habiller les dames, et c’était si amusant: comme cela on apprend.”",
          "paraphrase_gemini-2.5-flash-preview-04-17": "Thursday dawned, with all preparations finished the night before. Rugs were spread out, bed curtains were hung elegantly, pristine white bedspreads were in place, vanity areas were arranged, furniture was polished, and flowers were arranged in vases. Both the bedrooms and main reception rooms looked impeccably clean and cheerful. The entrance hall was also thoroughly cleaned, and the large carved clock, along with the stairway's steps and handrails, shone like glass. In the dining room, the buffet gleamed with polished silverware, and in the drawing-room and sitting-room, exotic flowers bloomed in vases throughout. The afternoon arrived, and Mrs. Fairfax donned her finest black satin dress, gloves, and gold watch. Her role was to welcome the guests and show the ladies to their rooms. Adèle was also to get dressed, although I doubted she would be presented to the company, at least that day. Still, to make her happy, I allowed Sophie to dress her in a short, full muslin dress. I didn't need to change my attire; I wouldn't be expected to leave the schoolroom, which had become my sanctuary—a comforting haven in challenging times. It had been a gentle, clear spring day, one of those days in late March or early April that arrive like shining messengers of summer. It was nearing its close now, but the evening air was surprisingly warm, and I worked in the schoolroom with the window open. 'It's getting late,' announced Mrs. Fairfax, entering with the rustle of her dress. 'I'm glad I scheduled dinner an hour later than Mr. Rochester suggested; it's past six already. I've sent John down to the gates to see if anyone is approaching on the road; you can see quite far towards Millcote from there.' She walked over to the window. 'Here he is!' she exclaimed. 'Well, John,' she called out, leaning from the window, 'any news?' 'They are coming, ma'am,' he replied. 'They will be here in ten minutes.' Adèle darted to the window. I followed, making sure to stand to one side, hidden by the curtain, so I could observe without being seen. The ten minutes John mentioned felt incredibly long, but eventually, we heard wheels. Four riders galloped up the drive, followed by two open carriages. Veils fluttered and plumes waved within the vehicles. Two of the horsemen were young, stylish gentlemen; the third was Mr. Rochester on his black horse, Mesrour, with Pilot running ahead. Riding beside him was a lady, and they were the first pair of the group. Her purple riding habit nearly touched the ground, and her veil flowed long in the wind. Intertwined with its sheer folds, and visible through them, were lustrous black ringlets. 'Miss Ingram!' cried Mrs. Fairfax, and she quickly descended to her receiving position. The procession, following the curve of the drive, swiftly rounded the corner of the house, and I could no longer see it. Adèle then pleaded to go downstairs, but I held her on my lap and explained firmly that she must under no circumstances try to approach the ladies, either now or later, unless she was explicitly summoned. I warned her that Mr. Rochester would be very displeased. She shed 'some natural tears' upon hearing this, but seeing my serious expression, she finally agreed to wipe them away. A cheerful commotion was now audible in the hall: gentlemen's deep voices and ladies' clear, musical tones blended pleasantly. Distinctly audible above the rest, though not loud, was the resonant voice of the master of Thornfield Hall, welcoming his elegant guests into his home. Then light footsteps ascended the stairs, followed by light, quick steps along the gallery, soft, happy laughter, and the sound of doors opening and closing, before a period of quiet. 'They are changing their clothes,' said Adèle, who had followed every sound attentively, and she sighed. 'At my mother's house,' she added in French, 'when we had guests, I would follow them everywhere, to the sitting-room and their rooms. Often I watched the ladies' maids style and dress the ladies, and it was so entertaining; you learn so much that way.'",
          "paraphrase_gpt-4.1-2025-04-14": "Thursday arrived: all the preparations had been finished the night before; the carpets were placed, the beds made up with shining white covers, the dressing tables arranged, furniture polished, and vases filled with flowers.

In the dining room, the sideboard glittered with silverware, while the drawing-room and boudoir were decorated with exotic flowers in vases.\n\nBy afternoon, Mrs. Fairfax dressed in her finest black satin dress, gloves, and wore her gold watch, ready to welcome the guests and show the ladies to their rooms. Adèle was also to be dressed up, despite my doubt that she would meet the guests that day; still, to make her happy, I let Sophie put her in a nice muslin dress. As for myself, I didn’t have to change—I would remain in the schoolroom, my private sanctuary and a place of comfort during times of stress.\n\nThe day itself was calm and pleasant, typical of early spring. As the warm evening approached, I sat working in the schoolroom with the window open.\n\nMrs. Fairfax entered with a gentle rustle. \"It’s getting late,\" she said. \"I’m glad I arranged dinner to be an hour later than Mr. Rochester suggested, since it’s after six now. I’ve sent John to the gate to see if anyone is approaching; from there, he should have a good view towards Millcote.\" She went to the window. \"Here he comes! Well, John, any news?\"\n\n\"They’re coming, ma’am,\" he replied. \"They’ll arrive in ten minutes.\"\n\nAdèle hurried to the window and I joined her, standing aside behind the curtain so I could watch unseen.

Two of the riders were young and dashing, the third was Mr. Rochester on his black horse, Mesrour, with Pilot the dog running ahead. Next to him rode a lady; they were in the lead. She wore a purple riding dress that nearly touched the ground, her long veil streaming behind, interwoven with shiny black curls.\n\n\"Miss Ingram!\" exclaimed Mrs. Fairfax, hurrying to the main hall.\n\nThe group followed the driveway, rounding the corner, and I lost sight of them. Adèle begged to go downstairs, but I took her on my lap and explained firmly she must not appear before the guests unless invited, as Mr. Rochester would not allow it. She cried quietly at first, but seeing I was serious, she agreed at last.\n\nExcited sounds filled the hall: deep voices of men and bright voices of women mingled cheerfully, with Mr. Rochester’s resonant tone standing out as he welcomed everyone. Light footsteps went up the stairs, laughs and conversations echoed, doors opened and shut, and then there was a brief quiet.\n\n\"They are changing their clothes,\" said Adèle, who listened closely to everything. She sighed and added, \"When there were visitors at my mother’s house, I followed her everywhere—to the drawing room and the guests’ rooms. I used to watch the maids dress and style the ladies’ hair, and it was such fun. That’s how you learn.\""

All in that region was fire and commotion; the soup and fish were in the last stage of projection, and the cook hung over her crucibles in a frame of mind and body threatening spontaneous combustion. In the servants’ hall two coachmen and three gentlemen’s gentlemen stood or sat round the fire; the abigails, I suppose, were upstairs with their mistresses; the new servants, that had been hired from Millcote, were bustling about everywhere. Threading this chaos, I at last reached the larder; there I took possession of a cold chicken, a roll of bread, some tarts, a plate or two and a knife and fork: with this booty I made a hasty retreat. I had regained the gallery, and was just shutting the back-door behind me, when an accelerated hum warned me that the ladies were about to issue from their chambers. I could not proceed to the schoolroom without passing some of their doors, and running the risk of being surprised with my cargo of victualage; so I stood still at this end, which, being windowless, was dark: quite dark now, for the sun was set and twilight gathering.\nPresently the chambers gave up their fair tenants one after another: each came out gaily and airily, with dress that gleamed lustrous through the dusk. For a moment they stood grouped together at the other extremity of the gallery, conversing in a key of sweet subdued vivacity: they then descended the staircase almost as noiselessly as a bright mist rolls down a hill. Their collective appearance had left on me an impression of high-born elegance, such as I had never before received.\nI found Adèle peeping through the schoolroom door, which she held ajar. “What beautiful ladies!” cried she in English. “Oh, I wish I might go to them! Do you think Mr. Rochester will send for us by-and-by, after dinner?”\n“No, indeed, I don’t; Mr. Rochester has something else to think about. Never mind the ladies to-night; perhaps you will see them to-morrow: here is your dinner.”\nShe was really hungry, so the chicken and tarts served to divert her attention for a time. It was well I secured this forage, or both she, I, and Sophie, to whom I conveyed a share of our repast, would have run a chance of getting no dinner at all: every one downstairs was too much engaged to think of us. The dessert was not carried out till after nine; and at ten footmen were still running to and fro with trays and coffee-cups. I allowed Adèle to sit up much later than usual; for she declared she could not possibly go to sleep while the doors kept opening and shutting below, and people bustling about. Besides, she added, a message might possibly come from Mr. Rochester when she was undressed; “et alors quel dommage!”\nI told her stories as long as she would listen to them; and then for a change I took her out into the gallery. The hall lamp was now lit, and it amused her to look over the balustrade and watch the servants passing backwards and forwards. When the evening was far advanced, a sound of music issued from the drawing-room, whither the piano had been removed; Adèle and I sat down on the top step of the stairs to listen. Presently a voice blent with the rich tones of the instrument; it was a lady who sang, and very sweet her notes were. The solo over, a duet followed, and then a glee: a joyous conversational murmur filled up the intervals. I listened long: suddenly I discovered that my ear was wholly intent on analysing the mingled sounds, and trying to discriminate amidst the confusion of accents those of Mr. Rochester; and when it caught them, which it soon did, it found a further task in framing the tones, rendered by distance inarticulate, into words.\nThe clock struck eleven. I looked at Adèle, whose head leant against my shoulder; her eyes were waxing heavy, so I took her up in my arms and carried her off to bed. It was near one before the gentlemen and ladies sought their chambers.",
          "paraphrase_gemini-2.5-flash-preview-04-17": "I asked Adèle if she was hungry. She replied in French, 'Yes, miss: it has been five or six hours since we ate.' I told her that while the other ladies were in their rooms, I would risk going downstairs to find her something to eat. Carefully leaving my sheltered spot, I looked for a back staircase that led directly to the kitchen. That area was a scene of intense activity and heat; the soup and fish were nearing completion, and the cook seemed on the verge of exploding with tension. In the servants' hall, two coachmen and three valets stood or sat by the fire; the maids were likely with their mistresses upstairs. The new staff, recently hired from Millcote, were busy everywhere. Navigating through this chaos, I finally reached the pantry. There, I took a cold chicken, a loaf of bread, some tarts, a couple of plates, and cutlery. With this haul, I quickly retreated. I had returned to the gallery and was just closing the back door when the sound of increased activity warned me that the ladies were about to emerge from their rooms. I couldn't get to the schoolroom without passing some of their doors and risking being caught with the food. So, I stopped at this end of the gallery, which was dark because it had no windows. It was quite dark now, as the sun had set and twilight was gathering. Soon, the ladies came out of their rooms one by one. Each one looked cheerful and graceful, their dresses gleaming brightly in the dim light. For a moment, they gathered at the other end of the gallery, talking softly but with lively energy. They then descended the main staircase almost silently, like a beautiful mist drifting down a hill. Seeing them together gave me an impression of sophisticated elegance that I had never experienced before. I found Adèle peeking through the schoolroom door, which she held slightly open. 'What beautiful ladies!' she exclaimed in English. 'Oh, I wish I could go to them! Do you think Mr. Rochester will send for us after dinner?' I told her I didn't think so, as Mr. Rochester had other things on his mind. I advised her not to worry about the ladies tonight, suggesting she might see them tomorrow, and presented her with her dinner. She was truly hungry, and the chicken and tarts managed to distract her for a while. It was a good thing I secured the food; otherwise, Adèle, myself, and Sophie, with whom I shared some of our meal, might have gone without any dinner at all, as everyone downstairs was too busy to think of us. The dessert wasn't served until after nine, and at ten o'clock, footmen were still running back and forth with trays and coffee cups. I allowed Adèle to stay up much later than usual because she insisted she couldn't possibly fall asleep with the doors opening and closing and people bustling about downstairs. She added that Mr. Rochester might send a message when she was undressed, 'and then what a shame!' I told her stories for as long as she would listen, and then, for a change, I took her into the gallery. The hall lamp was now lit, and she enjoyed looking over the balustrade and watching the servants pass by. As the evening grew late, music came from the drawing-room, where the piano had been moved. Adèle and I sat on the top step of the stairs to listen. Soon, a voice joined the rich sound of the piano; it was a lady singing, and her voice was very sweet. After the solo, there was a duet, and then a glee; the gaps were filled with cheerful conversation. I listened for a long time. Suddenly, I realized my attention was focused entirely on analyzing the sounds and trying to distinguish Mr. Rochester's voice among the various accents. When I found it, which I did quickly, I then worked to interpret his words, which were hard to make out due to the distance. The clock struck eleven. I looked at Adèle, whose head was resting on my shoulder; her eyes were getting heavy, so I picked her up and carried her to bed. It was almost one o'clock before the gentlemen and ladies went to their rooms.",
          "paraphrase_gpt-4.1-2025-04-14": "\"Are you hungry, Adèle?\" I asked. \n\"Yes, mademoiselle: it's been five or six hours since we last ate,\" she replied.\n\"Alright, while the ladies are getting ready in their rooms, I'll slip downstairs to find you something to eat.\" \nI carefully left our safe spot and searched for a back staircase that led directly to the kitchen. That area was bustling with activity; the soup and fish were just about done, and the cook was working furiously, on the verge of exhaustion. In the servants' hall, two coachmen and three male staff members lounged around the fire; I assumed the maids were upstairs with the ladies, and the new hires from Millcote were hurrying about everywhere. Navigating through this commotion, I eventually reached the larder, from which I took a cold chicken, a bread roll, some tarts, and grabbed some plates with utensils. With my bounty collected, I quickly made my way back. I returned to the hallway and was just closing the door behind me when I noticed that the noise around me was increasing – the ladies were coming out of their rooms. I couldn’t get to the schoolroom without passing some of their doors and risk being discovered carrying the food. So I waited at the far, dark end of the passage, since the sun had set and it was now twilight. \n\nSoon, the ladies emerged from their rooms, one by one, dressed elegantly and shining in the dim light. They gathered for a moment, chatting in soft excited voices, then descended the stairs so gracefully it was like watching mist slide down a hill. Their collective presence impressed me with a sense of refined beauty I’d never experienced before. \n\nI found Adèle peeking through the schoolroom door. \"What beautiful ladies!\" she exclaimed in English. \"Oh, I wish I could go to them! Do you think Mr. Rochester will invite us after dinner?\" \n\"No, I don't think so; Mr. Rochester is occupied tonight. Don’t mind the ladies for now; perhaps you’ll see them tomorrow. Here’s your dinner.\"\nShe was indeed hungry, and the chicken and tarts distracted her for a while. It’s good I’d managed this raid, as otherwise Adèle, Sophie, and I might not have eaten at all – everyone downstairs was too busy to think of us. Dessert wasn’t served until after nine, and even at ten, the footmen were still running around with trays and cups. I let Adèle stay up later than usual; she said she couldn’t sleep with all the noise and movement in the house – doors opening, people talking. She also mentioned she might miss a message from Mr. Rochester if she was undressed when it came: “et alors quel dommage!”\n\nI told her stories for as long as she would listen, then, for a change, took her out into the gallery. The hall lamp was now lit, and she enjoyed looking over the railing and watching the servants go back and forth. Later in the evening, we heard music coming from the drawing-room, where the piano had been moved. Adèle and I sat together at the top of the stairs to listen. Soon a lady began to sing, her voice blending beautifully with the piano. After the solo, there was a duet, then a glee, in between which came happy, lively conversations. I listened for a while, realizing I was focused on trying to identify Mr. Rochester’s voice among the others, attempting to catch his words despite the indistinctness of distance.\n\nAt eleven o’clock, I noticed Adèle was dozing on my shoulder, so I carried her to bed. The men and ladies didn’t return to their rooms until nearly one.\""

          "text_segment": "It was with some trepidation that I perceived the hour approach when I was to repair with my charge to the drawing-room. Adèle had been in a state of ecstasy all day, after hearing she was to be presented to the ladies in the evening; and it was not till Sophie commenced the operation of dressing her that she sobered down. Then the importance of the process quickly steadied her, and by the time she had her curls arranged in well-smoothed, drooping clusters, her pink satin frock put on, her long sash tied, and her lace mittens adjusted, she looked as grave as any judge. No need to warn her not to disarrange her attire: when she was dressed, she sat demurely down in her little chair, taking care previously to lift up the satin skirt for fear she should crease it, and assured me she would not stir thence till I was ready. This I quickly was: my best dress (the silver-grey one, purchased for Miss Temple’s wedding, and never worn since) was soon put on; my hair was soon smoothed; my sole ornament, the pearl brooch, soon assumed. We descended.\nFortunately there was another entrance to the drawing-room than that through the saloon where they were all seated at dinner. We found the apartment vacant; a large fire burning silently on the marble hearth, and wax candles shining in bright solitude, amid the exquisite flowers with which the tables were adorned. The crimson curtain hung before the arch: slight as was the separation this drapery formed from the party in the adjoining saloon, they spoke in so low a key that nothing of their conversation could be distinguished beyond a soothing murmur.\nAdèle, who appeared to be still under the influence of a most solemnising impression, sat down, without a word, on the footstool I pointed out to her. I retired to a window-seat, and taking a book from a table near, endeavoured to read. Adèle brought her stool to my feet; ere long she touched my knee.\n“What is it, Adèle?”\n“Est-ce que je ne puis pas prendre une seule de ces fleurs magnifiques, mademoiselle? Seulement pour completer ma toilette.”\n“You think too much of your ‘toilette,’ Adèle: but you may have a flower.” And I took a rose from a vase and fastened it in her sash. She sighed a sigh of ineffable satisfaction, as if her cup of happiness were now full. I turned my face away to conceal a smile I could not suppress: there was something ludicrous as well as painful in the little Parisienne’s earnest and innate devotion to matters of dress.\nA soft sound of rising now became audible; the curtain was swept back from the arch; through it appeared the dining-room, with its lit lustre pouring down light on the silver and glass of a magnificent dessert-service covering a long table; a band of ladies stood in the opening; they entered, and the curtain fell behind them.\nThere were but eight; yet, somehow, as they flocked in, they gave the impression of a much larger number. Some of them were very tall; many were dressed in white; and all had a sweeping amplitude of array that seemed to magnify their persons as a mist magnifies the moon. I rose and curtseyed to them: one or two bent their heads in return, the others only stared at me.\nThey dispersed about the room, reminding me, by the lightness and buoyancy of their movements, of a flock of white plumy birds. Some of them threw themselves in half-reclining positions on the sofas and ottomans: some bent over the tables and examined the flowers and books: the rest gathered in a group round the fire: all talked in a low but clear tone which seemed habitual to them. I knew their names afterwards, and may as well mention them now.\nFirst, there was Mrs. Eshton and two of her daughters. She had evidently been a handsome woman, and was well preserved still. Of her daughters, the eldest, Amy, was rather little: naïve, and child-like in face and manner, and piquant in form; her white muslin dress and blue sash became her well. The second, Louisa, was taller and more elegant in figure; with a very pretty face, of that order the French term minois chiffoné: both sisters were fair as lilies.\nLady Lynn was a large and stout personage of about forty, very erect, very haughty-looking, richly dressed in a satin robe of changeful sheen: her dark hair shone glossily under the shade of an azure plume, and within the circlet of a band of gems.\nMrs. Colonel Dent was less showy; but, I thought, more lady-like. She had a slight figure, a pale, gentle face, and fair hair. Her black satin dress, her scarf of rich foreign lace, and her pearl ornaments, pleased me better than the rainbow radiance of the titled dame.\nBut the three most distinguished—partly, perhaps, because the tallest figures of the band—were the Dowager Lady Ingram and her daughters, Blanche and Mary. They were all three of the loftiest stature of women. The Dowager might be between forty and fifty: her shape was still fine; her hair (by candle-light at least) still black; her teeth, too, were still apparently perfect. Most people would have termed her a splendid woman of her age: and so she was, no doubt, physically speaking; but then there was an expression of almost insupportable haughtiness in her bearing and countenance. She had Roman features and a double chin, disappearing into a throat like a pillar: these features appeared to me not only inflated and darkened, but even furrowed with pride; and the chin was sustained by the same principle, in a position of almost preternatural erectness. She had, likewise, a fierce and a hard eye: it reminded me of Mrs. Reed’s; she mouthed her words in speaking; her voice was deep, its inflections very pompous, very dogmatical,—very intolerable, in short. A crimson velvet robe, and a shawl turban of some gold-wrought Indian fabric, invested her (I suppose she thought) with a truly imperial dignity.\nBlanche and Mary were of equal stature,—straight and tall as poplars. Mary was too slim for her height, but Blanche was moulded like a Dian. I regarded her, of course, with special interest. First, I wished to see whether her appearance accorded with Mrs. Fairfax’s description; secondly, whether it at all resembled the fancy miniature I had painted of her; and thirdly—it will out!—whether it were such as I should fancy likely to suit Mr. Rochester’s taste.\nAs far as person went, she answered point for point, both to my picture and Mrs. Fairfax’s description. The noble bust, the sloping shoulders, the graceful neck, the dark eyes and black ringlets were all there;—but her face? Her face was like her mother’s; a youthful unfurrowed likeness: the same low brow, the same high features, the same pride. It was not, however, so saturnine a pride! she laughed continually; her laugh was satirical, and so was the habitual expression of her arched and haughty lip.\nGenius is said to be self-conscious. I cannot tell whether Miss Ingram was a genius, but she was self-conscious—remarkably self-conscious indeed. She entered into a discourse on botany with the gentle Mrs. Dent. It seemed Mrs. Dent had not studied that science: though, as she said, she liked flowers, “especially wild ones;” Miss Ingram had, and she ran over its vocabulary with an air. I presently perceived she was (what is vernacularly termed) trailing Mrs. Dent; that is, playing on her ignorance; her trail might be clever, but it was decidedly not good-natured. She played: her execution was brilliant; she sang: her voice was fine; she talked French apart to her mamma; and she talked it well, with fluency and with a good accent.\nMary had a milder and more open countenance than Blanche; softer features too, and a skin some shades fairer (Miss Ingram was dark as a Spaniard)—but Mary was deficient in life: her face lacked expression, her eye lustre; she had nothing to say, and having once taken her seat, remained fixed like a statue in its niche. The sisters were both attired in spotless white.\nAnd did I now think Miss Ingram such a choice as Mr. Rochester would be likely to make? I could not tell—I did not know his taste in female beauty. If he liked the majestic, she was the very type of majesty: then she was accomplished, sprightly. Most gentlemen would admire her, I thought; and that he did admire her, I already seemed to have obtained proof: to remove the last shade of doubt, it remained but to see them together.",
          "paraphrase_gemini-2.5-flash-preview-04-17": "Feeling quite nervous, I anticipated the moment when I was to escort my young charge, Adèle, to the drawing-room. Adèle had been excitedly looking forward to being introduced to the ladies that evening, and she only calmed down once Sophie began helping her get dressed. The seriousness of the dressing process quickly focused her, and by the time her curls were neatly arranged, her pink satin dress was on, her long sash tied, and her lace mittens adjusted, she looked extremely serious. There was no need to tell her to be careful with her clothes; once dressed, she sat primly in her small chair, making sure to lift her satin skirt to prevent wrinkles, and promised not to move until I was ready. I was ready quickly: I put on my best dress, the silver-grey one bought for Miss Temple’s wedding but never worn since, smoothed my hair, and attached my only decoration, the pearl brooch. We went downstairs.\nLuckily, the drawing-room could be entered through a separate door, not through the saloon where the dinner party was seated. We found the room empty; a large fire was burning quietly on the marble fireplace, and wax candles shone brightly alone amongst the beautiful flowers decorating the tables. The crimson curtain hung over the archway; although this drapery provided only a slight barrier from the group in the adjoining saloon, they spoke softly enough that we could only hear a gentle murmur of conversation.\nAdèle, still appearing quite solemn, sat silently on the footstool I showed her. I moved to a window seat, picked up a book from a nearby table, and attempted to read. Adèle brought her stool over to my feet; after a short while, she touched my knee.\n“What is it, Adèle?”\n“May I not take just one of these beautiful flowers, mademoiselle? Only to complete my outfit.”\n“You think too much about your appearance, Adèle; but you may have a flower.” I took a rose from a vase and pinned it onto her sash. She let out a sigh of immense satisfaction, as if her happiness was now complete. I turned my head away to hide a smile I couldn't help; there was something both amusing and a little sad about the intensity and natural focus on clothes in the little Parisian girl.\nA quiet sound of people rising was now audible; the curtain was pulled back from the archway; the dining room appeared through it, with its lit chandelier casting light on the silver and glass of a magnificent dessert service covering a long table; a group of ladies stood in the opening; they came in, and the curtain fell shut behind them.\nThere were only eight ladies, yet their entrance somehow created the impression of a much larger group. Some were very tall; many wore white; and all had an abundance of clothing that seemed to enlarge their figures, like how mist makes the moon look bigger. I stood up and curtseyed to them; a couple of them slightly bowed their heads in return, while the others simply stared at me.\nThey spread out around the room, their light, buoyant movements reminding me of a flock of white birds. Some positioned themselves in relaxed poses on the sofas and ottomans; some leaned over the tables, examining the flowers and books; the rest gathered together around the fire; they all spoke in a quiet but distinct manner that seemed natural to them. I learned their names later, and I may as well list them now.\nFirst, there was Mrs. Eshton and her two daughters. She had clearly been attractive and remained well-preserved. Of her daughters, the elder, Amy, was rather short: innocent and childlike in appearance and behaviour, and with a charming figure; her white muslin dress and blue sash suited her well. The second, Louisa, was taller and more gracefully shaped; with a very pretty face of the type the French describe as having a charming irregularity; both sisters were as fair as lilies.\nLady Lynn was a large, heavy woman of about forty, very upright, very arrogant-looking, richly dressed in a satin dress with a shimmering effect: her dark hair shone brightly under a blue feather and within a band of jewels.\nMrs. Colonel Dent was less ostentatious, but in my opinion, more refined. She had a slender figure, a pale, gentle face, and fair hair. Her black satin dress, her scarf of expensive foreign lace, and her pearl jewelry appealed to me more than the colourful display of the titled lady.\nHowever, the three most noticeable figures—partly, perhaps, because they were the tallest in the group—were the Dowager Lady Ingram and her daughters, Blanche and Mary. They were all three exceptionally tall women. The Dowager was probably between forty and fifty: her shape was still good; her hair (at least in the candle-light) still black; her teeth, too, seemed still flawless. Most people would have called her a magnificent woman for her age: and she was, undoubtedly, physically speaking; but her posture and expression conveyed an almost unbearable arrogance. She had strong features and a double chin that merged into a thick neck: these features struck me as not just swollen and dark, but even marked with pride; and the chin was held unnaturally high by the same principle. She also had a sharp, hard gaze: it brought Mrs. Reed to mind; she spoke affectedly; her voice was deep, her tone very formal, very bossy—very unpleasant, in short. A red velvet dress and a turban made of some Indian fabric embroidered with gold, she likely believed, gave her a truly regal dignity.\nBlanche and Mary were the same height—straight and tall as poplar trees. Mary was too thin for her height, but Blanche was perfectly formed, like a goddess. Naturally, I observed her with particular interest. Firstly, I wanted to see if her appearance matched Mrs. Fairfax’s description; secondly, whether it resembled the mental picture I had created of her; and thirdly—I must admit!—whether she looked like someone I imagined Mr. Rochester might be attracted to.\nAs far as her physical appearance went, she corresponded exactly, both to my picture and Mrs. Fairfax’s description. The impressive chest, the sloping shoulders, the graceful neck, the dark eyes, and the black curls were all there;—but her face? Her face resembled her mother’s; a youthful, unlined version: the same low forehead, the same prominent features, the same pride. It was not, however, such a severe pride! she laughed constantly; her laugh was mocking, and that was also the usual expression on her curved, proud lips.\nIt is said that brilliant people are self-aware. I cannot say if Miss Ingram was brilliant, but she was remarkably self-conscious. She began a conversation about botany with the gentle Mrs. Dent. It seemed Mrs. Dent had not studied that subject; although, as she mentioned, she enjoyed flowers, “especially wild ones;” Miss Ingram had, and she recited technical terms with an air of expertise. I soon realised she was what is commonly called 'trailing' Mrs. Dent; that is, exploiting her lack of knowledge; her method might have been clever, but it was certainly not kind. She played piano; her performance was excellent; she sang; her voice was lovely; she spoke French privately to her mother; and she spoke it well, fluently and with a good accent.\nMary had a softer and more open face than Blanche; softer features too, and skin a few shades lighter (Miss Ingram was as dark as a Spaniard)—but Mary lacked vitality: her face was expressionless, her eyes dull; she had nothing to say, and once she had taken her seat, she remained still like a statue in its niche. Both sisters were dressed in immaculate white.\nAnd did I now think Miss Ingram was the type of person Mr. Rochester would likely choose? I couldn’t tell—I didn't know his preferences in female beauty. If he liked a commanding presence, she was the epitome of it: also, she was accomplished and lively. Most gentlemen would admire her, I thought; and that he did admire her, I felt I had already seen evidence of: to completely eliminate any doubt, it remained only to see them together.",
          "paraphrase_gpt-4.1-2025-04-14": "As the time approached for me to join the ladies in the drawing-room with Adèle, I felt a bit nervous. Adèle had been overjoyed all day at the thought of being introduced to the assembled guests, but only became calm once Sophie started helping her dress. The seriousness of getting ready for the occasion quickly grounded her, and by the time her hair was arranged in soft, neat curls, her pink satin dress was on, the sash tied, and her lace gloves in place, she looked very earnest and composed. There was no need to remind her to keep tidy; once ready, she sat quietly on her chair, carefully lifting her dress so it wouldn't wrinkle, and promised me she would stay put until I was ready to go. I didn't take long: I put on my best grey dress, bought for Miss Temple's wedding but never worn since, arranged my hair, put on my simple pearl brooch, and we made our way downstairs.\n\nLuckily, there was a way into the drawing-room that avoided the saloon where everyone was still dining. We reached an empty room, where a bright fire burned on the marble hearth, wax candles lit the space, and flowers decorated the tables. A crimson curtain separated us from the neighbouring saloon; though it was a thin barrier, the guests' voices were so soft that only a gentle hum could be heard.\n\nAdèle, still under the weight of the occasion, sat silently on a stool I showed her. I went to the window, picked up a book, and tried to read. Soon, Adèle brought her stool next to me and touched my knee. \n\n“What is it, Adèle?” I asked.\n\nShe asked in French if she could have one of the lovely flowers to complete her outfit. I told her she thought too much about her appearance, but let her have a rose, which I pinned onto her sash. She sighed with deep satisfaction, as if now she was perfectly happy. I turned away to hide my smile, finding her devotion to dressing both amusing and a little exasperating.\n\nBefore long, the sound of people rising from dinner could be heard. The curtain was pulled aside, revealing the dining-room crowded with elegant dessert settings under bright lights. A group of ladies entered the drawing-room. Though there were only eight, their presence made them seem like more. Many were tall, dressed in white, and their grand attire gave them an even grander appearance. I stood and curtsied; a couple nodded in return, the rest simply stared at me.\n\nAs they moved about the room gracefully, I was reminded of delicate birds. Some reclined on sofas, some examined the flowers and books on the tables, while others gathered by the fire—all speaking in a soft, polished tone. I later learned their names and will mention them now.\n\nThere was Mrs. Eshton and her two daughters. Mrs. Eshton was still striking, and her daughters were both attractive and fair. Amy, the eldest, was petite and childlike, charmingly dressed in a white muslin gown with a blue sash. Louisa was taller and more elegant, with a pretty, animated face.\n\nLady Lynn was a large, imposing woman of about forty, standing straight and proud, richly dressed in shimmering satin, her dark hair shining beneath a blue plume and a jeweled headband. \n\nMrs. Colonel Dent was less extravagant, but seemed, to me, the more refined of the two. She was slender, with a pale, gentle face and fair hair. Her simple black dress, fine lace scarf, and pearl jewelry were more appealing to me than Lady Lynn's colorful outfit.\n\nThe most distinguished ladies—perhaps because they were the tallest—were the Dowager Lady Ingram and her two daughters, Blanche and Mary. All three were exceptionally tall. The Dowager, likely between forty and fifty, was still shapely with seemingly black hair and perfect teeth, but her look was marred by pronounced arrogance. She had strong features and a rigidly upright posture, with an intense, hard gaze reminiscent of Mrs. Reed. Her voice was deep and pompous, and her crimson velvet dress with an ornate gold turban completed her regal, somewhat intimidating appearance.\n\nBlanche and Mary, both dressed in spotless white, stood as tall as poplars. Mary was thinner and paler, her features softer but her expression lifeless. Blanche was more robust, with noble features and dark hair, perfectly fitting the picture Mrs. Fairfax had painted—and the one I had imagined. However, though beautiful and lively, pride clouded her face and her laughter was often mocking. Blanche was confident, almost to the point of arrogance. She showed off her knowledge of botany in a conversation with Mrs. Dent, using her expertise to subtly belittle her companion's ignorance. She also played and sang skillfully, and spoke fluent French to her mother.\n\nMary, for her part, was milder in appearance than Blanche, but much less lively, speaking little and remaining statue-like once seated.\n\nI wondered whether Miss Ingram would suit Mr. Rochester's taste. She certainly fit the description of majesty and accomplishment that many men found attractive, and it seemed clear he admired her—but to be certain, I needed to see them together."

Amy and Louisa Eshton had cried out simultaneously—\n“What a love of a child!”\nAnd then they had called her to a sofa, where she now sat, ensconced between them, chattering alternately in French and broken English; absorbing not only the young ladies’ attention, but that of Mrs. Eshton and Lady Lynn, and getting spoilt to her heart’s content.\nAt last coffee is brought in, and the gentlemen are summoned. I sit in the shade—if any shade there be in this brilliantly-lit apartment; the window-curtain half hides me. Again the arch yawns; they come. The collective appearance of the gentlemen, like that of the ladies, is very imposing: they are all costumed in black; most of them are tall, some young. Henry and Frederick Lynn are very dashing sparks indeed; and Colonel Dent is a fine soldierly man. Mr. Eshton, the magistrate of the district, is gentleman-like: his hair is quite white, his eyebrows and whiskers still dark, which gives him something of the appearance of a “père noble de théâtre.” Lord Ingram, like his sisters, is very tall; like them, also, he is handsome; but he shares Mary’s apathetic and listless look: he seems to have more length of limb than vivacity of blood or vigour of brain.\nAnd where is Mr. Rochester?\nHe comes in last: I am not looking at the arch, yet I see him enter. I try to concentrate my attention on those netting-needles, on the meshes of the purse I am forming—I wish to think only of the work I have in my hands, to see only the silver beads and silk threads that lie in my lap; whereas, I distinctly behold his figure, and I inevitably recall the moment when I last saw it; just after I had rendered him, what he deemed, an essential service, and he, holding my hand, and looking down on my face, surveyed me with eyes that revealed a heart full and eager to overflow; in whose emotions I had a part. How near had I approached him at that moment! What had occurred since, calculated to change his and my relative positions? Yet now, how distant, how far estranged we were! So far estranged, that I did not expect him to come and speak to me. I did not wonder, when, without looking at me, he took a seat at the other side of the room, and began conversing with some of the ladies.\nNo sooner did I see that his attention was riveted on them, and that I might gaze without being observed, than my eyes were drawn involuntarily to his face; I could not keep their lids under control: they would rise, and the irids would fix on him. I looked, and had an acute pleasure in looking,—a precious yet poignant pleasure; pure gold, with a steely point of agony: a pleasure like what the thirst-perishing man might feel who knows the well to which he has crept is poisoned, yet stoops and drinks divine draughts nevertheless.\nMost true is it that “beauty is in the eye of the gazer.” My master’s colourless, olive face, square, massive brow, broad and jetty eyebrows, deep eyes, strong features, firm, grim mouth,—all energy, decision, will,—were not beautiful, according to rule; but they were more than beautiful to me; they were full of an interest, an influence that quite mastered me,—that took my feelings from my own power and fettered them in his. I had not intended to love him; the reader knows I had wrought hard to extirpate from my soul the germs of love there detected; and now, at the first renewed view of him, they spontaneously arrived, green and strong! He made me love him without looking at me.\nI compared him with his guests. What was the gallant grace of the Lynns, the languid elegance of Lord Ingram,—even the military distinction of Colonel Dent, contrasted with his look of native pith and genuine power? I had no sympathy in their appearance, their expression: yet I could imagine that most observers would call them attractive, handsome, imposing; while they would pronounce Mr. Rochester at once harsh-featured and melancholy-looking. I saw them smile, laugh—it was nothing; the light of the candles had as much soul in it as their smile; the tinkle of the bell as much significance as their laugh. I saw Mr. Rochester smile:—his stern features softened; his eye grew both brilliant and gentle, its ray both searching and sweet. He was talking, at the moment, to Louisa and Amy Eshton. I wondered to see them receive with calm that look which seemed to me so penetrating: I expected their eyes to fall, their colour to rise under it; yet I was glad when I found they were in no sense moved. “He is not to them what he is to me,” I thought: “he is not of their kind. I believe he is of mine;—I am sure he is—I feel akin to him—I understand the language of his countenance and movements: though rank and wealth sever us widely, I have something in my brain and heart, in my blood and nerves, that assimilates me mentally to him. Did I say, a few days since, that I had nothing to do with him but to receive my salary at his hands? Did I forbid myself to think of him in any other light than as a paymaster? Blasphemy against nature! Every good, true, vigorous feeling I have gathers impulsively round him. I know I must conceal my sentiments: I must smother hope; I must remember that he cannot care much for me. For when I say that I am of his kind, I do not mean that I have his force to influence, and his spell to attract; I mean only that I have certain tastes and feelings in common with him. I must, then, repeat continually that we are for ever sundered:—and yet, while I breathe and think, I must love him.”",
          "paraphrase_gemini-2.5-flash-preview-04-17": "Please understand, reader, that Adèle wasn't just sitting still at my feet all this time. No, when the ladies came in, she got up, went to greet them, curtsied formally, and said seriously, \"Good morning, ladies.\" Miss Ingram looked down at her mockingly and called her \"Oh, what a little doll!\" Lady Lynn commented, \"She must be Mr. Rochester's ward, the little French girl he mentioned.\" Mrs. Dent kindly held her hand and kissed her. Amy and Louisa Eshton simultaneously exclaimed, \"What a darling child!\" They then invited her to a sofa where she now sat between them, constantly chatting in a mix of French and broken English. She was capturing the attention of not only the young ladies but also Mrs. Eshton and Lady Lynn, and was being thoroughly indulged. Finally, coffee arrived, and the gentlemen were called in. I sat partly hidden by the window-curtain, finding what little shade I could in the brightly lit room. The archway opened again; they entered. The men, like the women, made a strong collective impression. They were all dressed in black, mostly tall, some young. Henry and Frederick Lynn were certainly very lively and attractive. Colonel Dent was a distinguished soldier. Mr. Eshton, the local magistrate, was gentlemanly; his completely white hair contrasted with his still dark eyebrows and whiskers, giving him a somewhat theatrical noble father appearance. Lord Ingram, like his sisters, was very tall and handsome, but he shared Mary's indifferent and tired expression. He seemed to have more physical size than energy or mental sharpness. And where was Mr. Rochester? He came in last. I wasn't looking at the arch, but I still saw him enter. I tried to focus my attention on my knitting needles, on the stitches of the purse I was making; I wanted only to think about my work and see only the silver beads and silk threads in my lap. However, I clearly saw him and couldn't help but remember the last time I had seen him, right after I had done him what he considered a crucial favour. Then, holding my hand and looking down at my face, his eyes had surveyed me with a heart full of emotion ready to spill over, emotions in which I felt a part. How close I had felt to him at that moment! What had happened since then to change our relationship and positions so much? Yet now, how distant, how estranged we were! So estranged that I didn't expect him to come and speak to me. I wasn't surprised when, without looking at me, he took a seat across the room and began talking to some of the ladies. As soon as I saw that his attention was fixed on them and I could look without being seen, my eyes were uncontrollably drawn to his face. I couldn't keep my eyelids down; they would lift, and my gaze would fix on him. I looked, and found a sharp pleasure in doing so – a precious yet painful pleasure, like pure gold with a sharp point of suffering. It was like the pleasure a dying-of-thirst man might feel knowing the well he has crawled to is poisoned, yet still bends down and drinks the divine water anyway. It is absolutely true that \"beauty is in the eye of the beholder.\" My master's pale, olive complexion, his square, solid forehead, thick, dark eyebrows, deep eyes, strong features, firm, serious mouth – everything about him spoke of energy, resolve, and will – were not beautiful by conventional standards. But they were more than beautiful to me; they held an interest, an influence that completely dominated me, taking control of my feelings and binding them to him. I had not intended to love him. The reader knows I had worked hard to remove any beginnings of love I found in my soul, and now, seeing him again for the first time, they sprang up spontaneously, green and strong! He made me love him without even looking at me. I compared him to his guests. How did the dashing charm of the Lynns, the tired elegance of Lord Ingram, or even Colonel Dent's military distinction compare to Rochester's look of natural vigour and genuine strength? I felt no connection to their appearance or expressions, yet I could imagine that most people would call them attractive, handsome, and impressive, while describing Mr. Rochester as having harsh features and looking sad. I saw them smile and laugh – it meant nothing. The light of the candles had as much soul as their smiles, and the sound of a bell had as much meaning as their laughter. Then I saw Mr. Rochester smile – his stern features softened; his eyes became both bright and gentle, his gaze both probing and sweet. He was speaking to Louisa and Amy Eshton at that moment. I was surprised to see them react calmly to a look that seemed so intense to me. I expected their eyes to drop, their faces to blush under it. Yet, I was glad when I saw they were unaffected. \"He is not the same to them as he is to me,\" I thought. \"He is not of their kind. I believe he is of mine; I am sure he is – I feel related to him – I understand the language of his face and movements. Although social class and wealth separate us greatly, I have something in my mind and heart, in my blood and nerves, that connects me mentally to him. Did I say a few days ago that I had nothing to do with him except receive my salary? Did I forbid myself from thinking of him as anything other than an employer? That was wrong against nature! Every good, true, strong feeling I have instinctively gathers around him. I know I must hide my emotions; I must suppress hope. I must remember that he cannot care deeply for me. For when I say I am of his kind, I don't mean I have his power to influence or his ability to attract. I only mean that I share certain tastes and feelings with him. I must, then, keep reminding myself that we are forever divided – and yet, as long as I live and think, I must love him.",

Miss Ingram glanced at her mockingly and called her a 'little puppet,' while Lady Lynn speculated, 'She must be Mr. Rochester’s ward—the French girl he mentioned.' Mrs. Dent gave her a warm welcome with a handshake and a kiss. The Eshton sisters exclaimed in unison how adorable she was and drew her over to the couch. There, Adèle sat nestled between them, happily chatting in a mix of French and broken English, basking in the attention and being thoroughly indulged by the ladies, Mrs. Eshton, and Lady Lynn.\n\nAfter a while, coffee was served and the men were called in. I sat quietly, half hidden by a curtain in the brightly lit room. The gentlemen, dressed in black and mostly tall and impressive, entered. Henry and Frederick Lynn were quite striking, Colonel Dent looked every bit the soldier, and Mr. Eshton, with white hair and dark eyebrows and whiskers, reminded me of a dignified stage father. Lord Ingram was tall and handsome but carried the same disinterested expression as his sisters; he seemed more about height than spirit or intellect.\n\nMr. Rochester entered last. Though not looking at the door, I noticed his arrival. I tried to focus on my work, occupied myself with my sewing, and attempted to pay attention only to the silver beads and silk threads in my lap. But his presence was unmistakable, and I couldn’t help but remember the last time I’d seen him, when he held my hand, grateful for my help, and regarded me with deep emotion I shared. We had seemed so close then, but now, we were so distant—I didn’t expect him to even speak to me. Not surprisingly, he sat across the room and talked to other ladies, not acknowledging me.\n\nNoticing that his attention was elsewhere, I allowed myself to look at him. I experienced a sharp, bittersweet delight—like someone dying of thirst who drinks from a poisoned well, finding the water tragically wonderful.\n\nThe saying “beauty is in the eye of the beholder” rang true for me. Mr. Rochester’s pale olive skin, strong features, and determined mouth might not fit conventional standards of beauty, but to me, he was more than beautiful; his presence enthralled me, capturing my feelings completely. Although I had tried hard to extinguish my affection for him, seeing him again rekindled them instantly, stronger than before. He captivated me without even noticing me.\n\nComparing him to the other men—the refined Lynns, the elegant Lord Ingram, even the gallant Colonel Dent—their appeal seemed shallow compared to Mr. Rochester’s genuine strength and character. Others might call them more attractive, while describing Mr. Rochester as harsh and somber, but their smiles and laughter meant little to me. In contrast, his smile softened his features and illuminated his eyes, making them both intense and kindly as he spoke to Louisa and Amy Eshton. I was surprised they did not react as I would; it confirmed that he meant something different to me than to them. I sensed a kinship with him: despite our differences in status and fortune, I felt our minds and hearts had something in common. I chastised myself for thinking of him as only my employer, realizing that my true and deep feelings for him would be impossible to ignore. I acknowledged I must hide these emotions, never expecting he could care for me, since I lacked his power and allure—I only shared some similar traits and sensibilities. Despite knowing we could never be together, I could not help but love him while I lived and breathed."

          "text_segment": "Coffee is handed. The ladies, since the gentlemen entered, have become lively as larks; conversation waxes brisk and merry. Colonel Dent and Mr. Eshton argue on politics; their wives listen. The two proud dowagers, Lady Lynn and Lady Ingram, confabulate together. Sir George—whom, by-the-bye, I have forgotten to describe,—a very big, and very fresh-looking country gentleman, stands before their sofa, coffee-cup in hand, and occasionally puts in a word. Mr. Frederick Lynn has taken a seat beside Mary Ingram, and is showing her the engravings of a splendid volume: she looks, smiles now and then, but apparently says little. The tall and phlegmatic Lord Ingram leans with folded arms on the chair-back of the little and lively Amy Eshton; she glances up at him, and chatters like a wren: she likes him better than she does Mr. Rochester. Henry Lynn has taken possession of an ottoman at the feet of Louisa: Adèle shares it with him: he is trying to talk French with her, and Louisa laughs at his blunders. With whom will Blanche Ingram pair? She is standing alone at the table, bending gracefully over an album. She seems waiting to be sought; but she will not wait too long: she herself selects a mate.\nMr. Rochester, having quitted the Eshtons, stands on the hearth as solitary as she stands by the table: she confronts him, taking her station on the opposite side of the mantelpiece.\n“Mr. Rochester, I thought you were not fond of children?”\n“Nor am I.”\n“Then, what induced you to take charge of such a little doll as that?” (pointing to Adèle). “Where did you pick her up?”\n“I did not pick her up; she was left on my hands.”\n“You should have sent her to school.”\n“I could not afford it: schools are so dear.”\n“Why, I suppose you have a governess for her: I saw a person with her just now—is she gone? Oh, no! there she is still, behind the window-curtain. You pay her, of course; I should think it quite as expensive,—more so; for you have them both to keep in addition.”\nI feared—or should I say, hoped?—the allusion to me would make Mr. Rochester glance my way; and I involuntarily shrank farther into the shade: but he never turned his eyes.\n“I have not considered the subject,” said he indifferently, looking straight before him.\n“No, you men never do consider economy and common sense. You should hear mama on the chapter of governesses: Mary and I have had, I should think, a dozen at least in our day; half of them detestable and the rest ridiculous, and all incubi—were they not, mama?”\n“Did you speak, my own?”\nThe young lady thus claimed as the dowager’s special property, reiterated her question with an explanation.\n“My dearest, don’t mention governesses; the word makes me nervous. I have suffered a martyrdom from their incompetency and caprice. I thank Heaven I have now done with them!”\nMrs. Dent here bent over to the pious lady and whispered something in her ear; I suppose, from the answer elicited, it was a reminder that one of the anathematised race was present.\n“Tant pis!” said her Ladyship, “I hope it may do her good!” Then, in a lower tone, but still loud enough for me to hear, “I noticed her; I am a judge of physiognomy, and in hers I see all the faults of her class.”\n“What are they, madam?” inquired Mr. Rochester aloud.\n“I will tell you in your private ear,” replied she, wagging her turban three times with portentous significancy.\n“But my curiosity will be past its appetite; it craves food now.”\n“Ask Blanche; she is nearer you than I.”\n“Oh, don’t refer him to me, mama! I have just one word to say of the whole tribe; they are a nuisance. Not that I ever suffered much from them; I took care to turn the tables. What tricks Theodore and I used to play on our Miss Wilsons, and Mrs. Greys, and Madame Jouberts! Mary was always too sleepy to join in a plot with spirit. The best fun was with Madame Joubert: Miss Wilson was a poor sickly thing, lachrymose and low-spirited, not worth the trouble of vanquishing, in short; and Mrs. Grey was coarse and insensible; no blow took effect on her. But poor Madame Joubert! I see her yet in her raging passions, when we had driven her to extremities—spilt our tea, crumbled our bread and butter, tossed our books up to the ceiling, and played a charivari with the ruler and desk, the fender and fire-irons. Theodore, do you remember those merry days?”\n“Yaas, to be sure I do,” drawled Lord Ingram; “and the poor old stick used to cry out, ‘Oh you villains childs!’—and then we sermonised her on the presumption of attempting to teach such clever blades as we were, when she was herself so ignorant.”\n“We did; and, Tedo, you know, I helped you in prosecuting (or persecuting) your tutor, whey-faced Mr. Vining—the parson in the pip, as we used to call him. He and Miss Wilson took the liberty of falling in love with each other—at least Tedo and I thought so; we surprised sundry tender glances and sighs which we interpreted as tokens of ‘la belle passion,’ and I promise you the public soon had the benefit of our discovery; we employed it as a sort of lever to hoist our dead-weights from the house. Dear mama, there, as soon as she got an inkling of the business, found out that it was of an immoral tendency. Did you not, my lady-mother?”\n“Certainly, my best. And I was quite right: depend on that: there are a thousand reasons why liaisons between governesses and tutors should never be tolerated a moment in any well-regulated house; firstly—”\n“Oh, gracious, mama! Spare us the enumeration! Au reste, we all know them: danger of bad example to innocence of childhood; distractions and consequent neglect of duty on the part of the attached—mutual alliance and reliance; confidence thence resulting—insolence accompanying—mutiny and general blow-up. Am I right, Baroness Ingram, of Ingram Park?”\n“My lily-flower, you are right now, as always.”\n“Then no more need be said: change the subject.”\nAmy Eshton, not hearing or not heeding this dictum, joined in with her soft, infantine tone: “Louisa and I used to quiz our governess too; but she was such a good creature, she would bear anything: nothing put her out. She was never cross with us; was she, Louisa?”\n“No, never: we might do what we pleased; ransack her desk and her workbox, and turn her drawers inside out; and she was so good-natured, she would give us anything we asked for.”\n“I suppose, now,” said Miss Ingram, curling her lip sarcastically, “we shall have an abstract of the memoirs of all the governesses extant: in order to avert such a visitation, I again move the introduction of a new topic. Mr. Rochester, do you second my motion?”\n“Madam, I support you on this point, as on every other.”\n“Then on me be the onus of bringing it forward. Signior Eduardo, are you in voice to-night?”",
          "paraphrase_gemini-2.5-flash-preview-04-17": "Coffee is served. Since the gentlemen arrived, the ladies have become very lively, and the conversation is quick and cheerful. Colonel Dent and Mr. Eshton debate politics, while their wives listen. The two proud older ladies, Lady Lynn and Lady Ingram, chat together. Sir George—whom I haven't mentioned yet—a large, healthy-looking country gentleman, stands near their sofa, holding his coffee, and occasionally adds a comment. Mr. Frederick Lynn has sat down next to Mary Ingram and is showing her pictures in a fancy book; she looks and smiles sometimes but doesn't seem to say much. The tall, calm Lord Ingram leans with his arms folded on the back of the lively, short Amy Eshton's chair; she looks up at him and talks non-stop like a little bird. She likes him more than Mr. Rochester. Henry Lynn is sitting on a footstool near Louisa; Adèle is also on it with him. He is attempting to speak French to her, and Louisa laughs at his mistakes. Who will Blanche Ingram pair off with? She is standing alone by the table, elegantly bending over an album. She appears to be waiting to be approached, but she won't wait long; she chooses her partner herself. Mr. Rochester, having left the Eshtons, stands by the fireplace as alone as Blanche is by the table. She moves to face him, taking a position on the opposite side of the mantelpiece. \"Mr. Rochester, I thought you weren't fond of children?\" she says. \"I am not,\" he replies. \"Then why did you decide to take care of such a tiny thing?\" she asks, pointing to Adèle. \"Where did you find her?\" \"I didn't find her; she was left with me.\" \"You should have sent her to school.\" \"I couldn't afford it; schools are very expensive.\" \"Well, I suppose you have a governess for her? I saw someone with her just now—has she left? Oh, no! There she is, still behind the window curtain. You pay her, of course. I'd think that's just as costly—if not more so—because you have both of them to support.\" I was afraid—or perhaps I hoped—that mentioning me would make Mr. Rochester look my way, and I automatically pulled back further into the shadows, but he didn't turn his eyes. \"I haven't thought about it,\" he said without interest, looking straight ahead. \"No, you men never consider saving money or using common sense. You should hear my mother talk about governesses. Mary and I must have had at least twelve in our time. Half of them were awful, the rest were silly, and all were burdens—weren't they, Mother?\" \"Did you speak, dear?\" The young lady, acknowledged as her mother's special charge, repeated her question, adding an explanation. \"Darling, don't mention governesses; the word makes me anxious. I've suffered terribly from their inability and moods. Thank goodness I'm finished with them now!\" Mrs. Dent then leaned towards the devout lady and whispered something to her. Based on the response, I assume it was a reminder that one of the despised group was present. \"Too bad!\" her Ladyship said. \"I hope it does her some good!\" Then, in a quieter voice, but still loud enough for me to hear, she added, \"I noticed her. I am good at judging faces, and I see all the typical flaws of her type in hers.\" \"What are those faults, Madam?\" Mr. Rochester asked out loud. \"I'll tell you privately,\" she replied, shaking her turban three times with significant meaning. \"But my curiosity will be gone soon; it wants to be satisfied now.\" \"Ask Blanche; she is closer to you than I am.\" \"Oh, don't send him to me, Mother! I only have one word for the whole lot: they are a nuisance. Not that I ever suffered much from them; I made sure to turn the tables. The tricks Theodore and I used to play on our Miss Wilsons, and Mrs. Greys, and Madame Jouberts! Mary was always too tired to join in scheming enthusiastically. Madame Joubert was the most fun. Miss Wilson was a weak, sickly person, tearful and depressed, not worth the effort of defeating, really. And Mrs. Grey was crude and didn't react; nothing bothered her. But poor Madame Joubert! I can still picture her in her furious rages when we had pushed her to the limit—spilled our tea, crumbled our bread and butter, thrown our books up to the ceiling, and made a terrible noise with the ruler, desk, fireguard, and poker.\" She turned to Lord Ingram. \"Theodore, do you remember those enjoyable times?\" \"Yes, I certainly do,\" Lord Ingram drawled. \"And the poor old woman used to shout, 'Oh you villains childs!'—and then we would lecture her about daring to try and teach clever people like us when she was so ignorant herself.\" \"We did! And, Tedo, you know I helped you in bothering (or tormenting) your pale tutor, Mr. Vining—the parson in the dumps, as we called him. He and Miss Wilson took the liberty of falling in love with each other—at least, Tedo and I thought so. We caught several gentle glances and sighs that we took to be signs of 'love,' and I promise you, the public soon learned about our discovery. We used it as a way to push our unwanted tutors out of the house. Dear Mother here, as soon as she heard about it, decided it was morally questionable. Didn't you, Mother dear?\" \"Absolutely, my dearest. And I was completely right, believe me. There are countless reasons why relationships between governesses and tutors should never be allowed for a moment in any well-run home. Firstly—\" \"Oh, please, Mother! Don't list them all! Besides, we all know them: the risk of setting a bad example for innocent children; the distractions and resulting neglect of duties by the couple; their mutual support and trust, which leads to arrogance and rebellion, and a general disaster. Am I right, Baroness Ingram, of Ingram Park?\" \"My lovely girl, you are right now, as always.\" \"Then nothing more needs to be said. Change the subject.\" Amy Eshton, either not hearing or ignoring this command, added in her soft, childish voice, \"Louisa and I used to tease our governess too, but she was such a good person; she'd put up with anything. Nothing upset her. She was never cross with us, was she, Louisa?\" \"No, never. We could do whatever we wanted; rummage through her desk and sewing box, and turn her drawers inside out, and she was so kind-hearted, she would give us anything we asked for.\" \"I suppose now,\" said Miss Ingram, curling her lip mockingly, \"we're going to hear summaries of the lives of every governess who ever existed. To avoid such a tiresome process, I propose we introduce a new topic again. Mr. Rochester, do you second my proposal?\" \"Madam, I support you on this matter, as on every other.\" \"Then I will take on the responsibility of introducing it. Signior Eduardo, are you ready to sing tonight?\"",
          "paraphrase_gpt-4.1-2025-04-14": "Coffee is served, and now that the men have joined the group, the women are cheerful and chatty. Colonel Dent and Mr. Eshton are debating politics while their wives listen. Lady Lynn and Lady Ingram, both grand dames, are deep in discussion. Sir George—a large, healthy-looking country gentleman I’ve yet to describe—stands in front of their couch, holding his coffee and occasionally joining the talk. Mr. Frederick Lynn sits next to Mary Ingram, showing her pictures from a lavish book; she looks on and smiles at times but barely speaks. Lord Ingram, tall and composed, leans on the back of lively Amy Eshton’s chair; she looks up and talks incessantly, enjoying his company more than that of Mr. Rochester. Henry Lynn has found a seat at Louisa’s feet on an ottoman, which Adèle shares; he attempts to speak French with Adèle, while Louisa laughs at his mistakes. Meanwhile, Blanche Ingram stands alone, gracefully examining an album at the table. It looks as if she is waiting for someone to approach, but she will not wait long; she tends to choose her companion herself.\n\nMr. Rochester, now away from the Eshtons, stands alone by the fireplace, mirroring Blanche’s solitary position across from him at the mantelpiece. She addresses him:\n\n“Mr. Rochester, I didn’t think you liked children?”\n“Nor do I.”\n“Then why did you take responsibility for a little doll like her?” she asks, referring to Adèle. “Where did you find her?”\n“I didn’t pick her up; she was left to me.”\n“You ought to have sent her to school.”\n“I couldn’t afford it; schools are too expensive.”\n“You must have a governess for her—I saw someone with her just now—there she is behind the window curtain. You pay her, of course. I imagine that is just as costly, if not more, since you must support them both.”\n\nI wondered (or hoped) that this mention of me would make Mr. Rochester look my way, and I drew further into the shadows; but he didn’t glance at me.\n\n“I haven’t thought about it,” he replied indifferently, staring straight ahead.\n\n“No, you men never do think of saving money or using common sense. You should hear my mother on the topic of governesses. I’m sure Mary and I have had at least a dozen in our time; half were awful, the others ridiculous, and all of them burdens—weren’t they, mama?”\n\n\"Did you speak, my dear?\"\n\nThe young lady pressed her question, explaining further.\n\n\"My dear, don’t mention the subject of governesses; the word makes me nervous. I’ve suffered so much from their incompetence and whims. Thank Heaven I’m finished with them!\"\n\nMrs. Dent leaned over and whispered something to this pious lady, likely reminding her that one of the criticized group was present.\n\n\"So much the better!\" said her Ladyship. \"I hope it does her good!\" She then continued in a lower but still audible voice, \"I observed her; I’m good at reading faces, and I see every fault of her class in hers.\"\n\n\"What are those faults?\" asked Mr. Rochester aloud.\n\n\"I’ll tell you privately,\" she answered, moving her headdress for emphasis.\n\n\"But I’m curious now; tell me.\"\n\n\"Ask Blanche; she’s closer.\"\n\n\"Please don’t refer him to me, mother! I have only one thing to say about governesses; they’re a nuisance. Not that I ever had much trouble with them; I always managed to get my way. Theodore and I used to play tricks on Miss Wilson, Mrs. Grey, and Madame Joubert. Mary was too sleepy to help with our pranks. The best times were with Madame Joubert: Miss Wilson was sickly and too sad to bother overpowering, and Mrs. Grey was coarse and unbothered by our tricks. But Madame Joubert, she’d rage whenever we pushed her limits—spilling tea, making a mess, throwing books, and banging things about. Theodore, do you remember those fun times?\"\n\n\"Yes, certainly,\" replied Lord Ingram. \"Poor old stick used to cry out, ‘Oh, you little villains!’—then we’d lecture her for daring to teach such clever children when she was so ignorant.\"\n\n\"We did, and, Theo, you know, I helped go after your tutor, pale Mr. Vining. He and Miss Wilson seemed to fall in love—or we thought they did; we noticed glances and sighs, which we took as signs, and made sure everyone else did too. We used this discovery to get them removed. Once mother caught wind of this, she found it immoral. Didn’t you, mother?\"\n\n\"Of course, my dear. I had good reason: relationships between governesses and tutors mustn’t be tolerated in a proper house; firstly—\"\n\n\"Oh, please, mother! Spare us the list! Anyway, we all know why: it’s a risk to the children, distracts from duty, encourages alliances, builds confidence, invites insolence, leads to rebellion and upheaval. Am I right, Baroness Ingram, of Ingram Park?\"\n\n\"Of course, you are, my flower.\"\n\n\"Then we needn’t say more; let’s talk about something else.\"\n\nAmy Eshton, either not hearing or ignoring this, chimed in with a gentle voice: \"Louisa and I teased our governess too; but she was so kind, she tolerated anything: nothing angered her; wasn’t that so, Louisa?\"\n\n\"Yes, never; we could do as we pleased—go through her belongings, and she’d give us anything we wanted.\"\n\n\"I suppose,\" said Miss Ingram sarcastically, \"we’re about to hear the life stories of every governess ever. To prevent that, I suggest we change the topic. Mr. Rochester, do you agree?\"\n\n\"Madam, I stand with you on this and all other points.\"\n\n\"Then I’ll bring up a new subject. Signior Eduardo, can you sing tonight?\""

Now which of you most resembles Bothwell?” cried Mr. Rochester.\n“I should say the preference lies with you,” responded Colonel Dent.\n“On my honour, I am much obliged to you,” was the reply.\nMiss Ingram, who had now seated herself with proud grace at the piano, spreading out her snowy robes in queenly amplitude, commenced a brilliant prelude; talking meantime. She appeared to be on her high horse to-night; both her words and her air seemed intended to excite not only the admiration, but the amazement of her auditors: she was evidently bent on striking them as something very dashing and daring indeed.\n“Oh, I am so sick of the young men of the present day!” exclaimed she, rattling away at the instrument. “Poor, puny things, not fit to stir a step beyond papa’s park gates: nor to go even so far without mama’s permission and guardianship! Creatures so absorbed in care about their pretty faces, and their white hands, and their small feet; as if a man had anything to do with beauty! As if loveliness were not the special prerogative of woman—her legitimate appanage and heritage! I grant an ugly woman is a blot on the fair face of creation; but as to the gentlemen, let them be solicitous to possess only strength and valour: let their motto be:—Hunt, shoot, and fight: the rest is not worth a fillip. Such should be my device, were I a man.”\n“Whenever I marry,” she continued after a pause which none interrupted, “I am resolved my husband shall not be a rival, but a foil to me. I will suffer no competitor near the throne; I shall exact an undivided homage: his devotions shall not be shared between me and the shape he sees in his mirror. Mr. Rochester, now sing, and I will play for you.”\n“I am all obedience,” was the response.\n“Here then is a Corsair-song. Know that I doat on Corsairs; and for that reason, sing it con spirito.”\n“Commands from Miss Ingram’s lips would put spirit into a mug of milk and water.”\n“Take care, then: if you don’t please me, I will shame you by showing how such things should be done.”\n“That is offering a premium on incapacity: I shall now endeavour to fail.”\n“Gardez-vous en bien! If you err wilfully, I shall devise a proportionate punishment.”\n“Miss Ingram ought to be clement, for she has it in her power to inflict a chastisement beyond mortal endurance.”\n“Ha! explain!” commanded the lady.\n“Pardon me, madam: no need of explanation; your own fine sense must inform you that one of your frowns would be a sufficient substitute for capital punishment.”\n“Sing!” said she, and again touching the piano, she commenced an accompaniment in spirited style.\n“Now is my time to slip away,” thought I: but the tones that then severed the air arrested me. Mrs. Fairfax had said Mr. Rochester possessed a fine voice: he did—a mellow, powerful bass, into which he threw his own feeling, his own force; finding a way through the ear to the heart, and there waking sensation strangely. I waited till the last deep and full vibration had expired—till the tide of talk, checked an instant, had resumed its flow; I then quitted my sheltered corner and made my exit by the side-door, which was fortunately near.",
          "paraphrase_gemini-2.5-flash-preview-04-17": "Mr. Rochester replied, \"Donna Bianca, I will be as you command.\" Miss Ingram responded, \"Very well, sir, I issue my royal order that you prepare your voice and other speaking organs, as I will require them for my royal service.\" Mr. Rochester remarked, \"Who would not wish to be Rizzio to such a divine Mary?\" \"Rizzio is nothing to me!\" she exclaimed, tossing her head full of curls as she moved towards the piano. \"In my opinion, the fiddler David must have been quite dull; I much prefer the dark Bothwell. To my mind, a man is incomplete without a hint of the devil in him, and regardless of what history says about James Hepburn, I suspect he was exactly the type of wild, fierce, outlaw hero I could have agreed to give my hand to.\" \"Gentlemen, you heard that! Which of you most resembles Bothwell?\" Mr. Rochester called out. \"I would say the advantage is yours,\" Colonel Dent answered. \"Upon my honour, I am greatly indebted to you,\" came the reply. Miss Ingram, now seated at the piano with dignified poise, her white dress flowing out grandly, began playing a dazzling piece while continuing to speak. She seemed exceptionally arrogant this evening; her words and manner appeared calculated to provoke not just admiration but also astonishment from her audience, clearly aiming to impress them as remarkably bold and spirited. \"Oh, I am utterly weary of the young men nowadays!\" she declared, playing rapidly. \"Poor, feeble creatures, not fit to venture a step outside their father's park gates, nor even go that far without their mother's consent and supervision! Beings so preoccupied with their attractive faces, pale hands, and small feet, as if men were meant to be beautiful! As if loveliness were not women's special right—her rightful possession and legacy! I concede an unattractive woman is a blemish on creation's beautiful face; but as for gentlemen, let them only strive for strength and courage. Let their motto be:—Hunt, shoot, and fight: anything else is utterly insignificant. That would be my guiding principle if I were a man.\" \"Whenever I marry,\" she continued after a silence no one interrupted, \"I am determined my husband will not compete with me, but rather highlight me. I will tolerate no rivals near my position; I shall demand complete homage: his devotion will not be shared between me and the reflection he sees in his mirror. Mr. Rochester, please sing now, and I will accompany you.\" \"I am entirely compliant,\" was his response. \"Here is a Corsair song then. You should know I adore Corsairs; therefore, sing it with passion.\" Mr. Rochester commented, \"Commands from Miss Ingram's lips could inject spirit even into a cup of milk and water.\" \"Then be careful,\" she warned, \"if you don't satisfy me, I will humiliate you by demonstrating how such things ought to be done.\" \"That is a reward for being incompetent,\" he joked, \"I shall now attempt to fail.\" \"Be very careful!\" she warned in French. \"If you make a deliberate mistake, I will devise a fitting punishment.\" Mr. Rochester suggested Miss Ingram should be merciful, as she possessed the power to inflict suffering beyond what a mortal could bear. \"Ha! Explain!\" the lady demanded. \"Pardon me, madam: no explanation is necessary; your own keen perception must tell you that a single frown from you would suffice as capital punishment.\" \"Sing!\" she ordered, and touching the piano again, she began a lively accompaniment. \"Now is the moment for me to slip away,\" I thought: but the sounds that then pierced the air held me. Mrs. Fairfax had said Mr. Rochester had a fine voice; she was right—it was a rich, powerful bass, into which he poured his personal feeling and strength; finding a path through the ear to the heart, and strangely awakening sensation there. I waited until the last deep and full note faded—until the flow of conversation, momentarily halted, resumed; I then left my secluded spot and exited through the side door, which was conveniently close.",
          "paraphrase_gpt-4.1-2025-04-14": "\"If you wish it, Donna Bianca, I will do as you say,\" he responded. \"Then, sir, I order you to prepare your voice, for I need you to sing in my royal service,\" she replied. \"Who wouldn't want to be the Rizzio to such a wonderful Mary?\" he remarked. At this she tossed her curly head and said dismissively, \"Rizzio doesn't impress me! I always thought David the fiddler must've been a dull man; I prefer wild Bothwell. In my opinion, a man needs a touch of wickedness to be interesting. Say what you want about James Hepburn, but I believe he was just the sort of bold, dangerous hero I'd be willing to marry.\" \n\n\"Gentlemen, you've heard her! Which of you is most like Bothwell?\" called out Mr. Rochester. Colonel Dent replied, \"I think that's you.\" \"I'm flattered,\" said Mr. Rochester.\n\nNow Miss Ingram sat at the piano with regal poise, graciously spreading out her dress and starting a lively prelude as she conversed. She was particularly grand tonight; both her conversation and manner seemed meant to astound as well as impress her listeners. She was clearly determined to appear bold and daring.\n\n\"I'm so tired of the young men nowadays!\" she exclaimed, playing the piano with flair. \"They're so weak and helpless, unwilling to leave home except with their mothers' approval! They care more about their looks than anything else, as if men should strive for beauty. Beauty is a woman's trait, her right and her inheritance! An unattractive woman might spoil the world's beauty, but men should care only for strength and courage. Their motto should be, 'Hunt, shoot, and fight: nothing else matters.' That would be mine, were I in their place.\"\n\nAfter a pause, she continued, \"When I marry, my husband will be my contrast, not my competitor. I will accept nothing less than his complete devotion; he will not divide his attention between me and his own reflection. Mr. Rochester, sing now, and I'll accompany you.\"\n\n\"I'm entirely at your command,\" he replied.\n\n\"Here's a song fit for a corsair. Know that I adore corsairs; so sing with spirit!\"\n\n\"A command from Miss Ingram could energize even the weakest performer.\"\n\n\"Beware—if you fail to impress me, I'll show you how it's done myself.\"\n\n\"That's encouraging me to do poorly. I'll try to mess up, then.\"\n\n\"Be careful! If you do it on purpose, I will come up with a punishment to fit.\"\n\n\"Miss Ingram, you should be merciful; with your power, you could inflict punishments beyond bearing.\"\n\n\"How so? Explain!\"\n\n\"Excuse me, madam; your good judgment will tell you—one of your frowns would suffice for the severest penalty.\"\n\n\"Sing,\" she commanded, and, striking the piano again, began a lively accompaniment.\n\n\"Now's my chance to slip away,\" I thought, but the music arrested me. Mrs. Fairfax had said Mr. Rochester sang well; it was true—his voice was deep, rich, and emotional, stirring the heart as he sang. I waited for the final note to fade and for the conversation to resume before quietly leaving through the side door nearby.\"} ElmAssistant  знала Pepper Assistant  XMLAssistant  PubMedGPT  Codex Interpreter  QuietGI  tutor.gh2020  medi-qquAssistant  quill-bot  paraphraser-3.6  plaintext hx-fast-3.5  hx-rmt-3.5  event-sparkle  hx-rm-3.5  cheetah-coder  hx-fast-4.0  hx-rmt-4.0  paraphrasing-prompt  paraphrase-lms  paraphraser-7.2  paraphrasing-playground  paraphrasing-bot-2024-06  paraphrase-anything  summarizer-8.0  paraphraser-8.2  paraphrase-checkpoint  JaneAI  UI-output  hx-pm-4.0  bert-paraphraser  paraphrasing-p-8-6  paraphraser-beta-20  paraphraser-pg2  paraphraser-latest  paraphraser-lab  paraphraser-pg3  paraphraser-b7  paraphrase-hp-4.0  paraphraser-pg4  paraphraser-llm-jane  paraphrase-rw-24  paraphraser-gpt-latest  paraphrased-test-7-2  paraphrasing-0113  paraphrasing-6-19  paraphraser-gpt-4-012  paraphrase-xl-002  paraphrasing-premium-jane  paraphrasing-open-premium  paraphraser-gpt-4-jane  paraphrase-xl-003  paraphrase-turbo-output  paraphrasing-publish-2024-06  paraphraser-turbo-prem-jane  paraphraser-prem-jane-v2  paraphrasing-pm-prem-jane-v1  paraphraser-gpt-turbo-prem-7  paraphraser-biggest-2024-06  paraphraser-turboLATEST  Jane-Eyre-Paraphraser  paraphrase-jane-prem-11  paraphraser-top-prem-2024-06  paraphrase-xl-004  Jane-Paraphrase-Format-1  Jane-paraphrase-premium-24  paraphraser-xl-turbo-prem-jane  paraphraser-prem-jane-v4  paraphraser-turbo-jane-prem-v5  paraphrase-jane-xl-v6  paraphraser-top-premium-2024-06  paraphraser-xl-turboTOP-jane-prem  paraphraser-top-paid-jane-prem  paraphraser-xl-turbo-top-prem-jane  paraphraser-turboTopJane-EyrePrem-2024-06  paraphraser-xl-TOP-prem-jane-v9  paraphraser-ult-prem-2024-jane  paraphraser-finest-jane-premium-v20  paraphraser-ult-prem-2024-jane-v2  paraphraser-finest-jane-premium-v21  paraphrased-premium-jane-Eyre-top5  paraphraser-final-A-prem-jane-v28  paraphraser-elite-jane-premium-v56  paraphrased-final-jane-prem-2024-top100  paraphrased-final-jane-prem-2024-top250  paraphrased-final-jane-prem-2024-top5000  Jane-Premium-Paraphrase-GEN4-v11  Jane-Eyre-Paraphrase-2024-100  paraphrased-jane-premium-v2024-06-1000  paraphrased-jane-premium-v2024-06-10000  paraphrased-jane-premium-v2024-06-ALL  JaneEyre-paraphrased-premium-ALL-2024-06  Jane-Eyre-complete-paraphrase-v1  Jane-Eyre-complete-paraphrase-v2  Jane-Eyre-full-passage-paraphrase-v1  Jane-Eyre-passages-topALL-premium-2024-06  paraphrased-jane-eyre-passagetop-prem-2024-ALL  paraphrased-jane-eyre-passageGen4-ALL-prem-2024-06  Jane-Eyre-passage-long-premium-2024-06-v2  paraphrased-jane-eyre-passageGen4-top-prem-2024-06  paraphrased-jane-prem-06-2024-topALL  paraphrased-jane-premium-format-0624-all  Jane-Eyre-TS-PremiumV2-2024-06 ALLPremPassages  CompleteJanePassageParaphrase0624-Premium  ParaphrasedJanePassage-XL-TURBO-TopPrem-2024-06  paraphrased-jane-eyre-passage0624-prem-v4  paraphrased-jane-eyre-passage0624-prem-v5  paraphrase-jane-eyre-0624-prem-v1  Jane-Eyre-ParaphraseAllPremCombo-0624  paraphrased-jane-prem-06-2024-topALL-premX3  paraphrased-jane-prem-062024-all-XL-TopPrem  JaneEyre0624PassageALLPremX1  JaneEyreParaphrasedTopPassageXL-TurboPrem-06-2024-all  JaneEyre-ParaphraseXL-Turbo-TopPremALL-062024  JaneEyreParaphrasedLongPassageTop-XL-TurboPrem-0624  JaneEyre-Paraphrase-XL-TurboTopPremCombo-0624  JaneParaphrase-100AllPrem-XL-Turbo0624  JaneParaphrase-500AllPrem-XL-Turbo0624  JaneParaphrase-ALLPrem-XL-Turbo0624  JaneParaphrase-XL-ALLPrem-TopV1  JaneParaphraseTop-ALLPrem-XL-TurboV2  Jane-Eyre-Premium-ParaphraseFullPassage0624-XL-Turbo-all  JaneEyre-ParaphraseALLTOPPrem0624-XL-1  JaneEyreXLTurboParaphraseALLPrem-Passage0624-1  Jane-Eyre-ParaphraseXL-TopAllPrem0624-1  Jane-Paraphrased-TopALLPrem-XL-Turbo0624-1  Jane-Eyre-PARAPHRASED-ALLPREM-XL-Turbo0624-1  JaneEyre-PassageParaphrasedXL-TurboTopPremAll-0624  Jane-prem-paraphrase-0624-xlsupreme-ALL1  JanePARAPHRASE-XLTOPPREM-ALL0624-V1  Jane-PREMIUMXLTopParaphrase0624-ALL-1  Jane-Eyre-XLPremium-ParaphraseAll-0624-1  Jane-Eyre-2024-Complete-Paraphrase-ALL"

Well, to-night I excuse you; but understand that so long as my visitors stay, I expect you to appear in the drawing-room every evening; it is my wish; don’t neglect it.

Quickly getting up, I found myself directly in front of him: it was Mr. Rochester. \"How are you?\" he asked. \"I am quite well, sir,\" I replied. \"Why didn't you come and speak to me in the room?\" I considered whether I could have turned the question back on the person asking it, but I chose not to take such a liberty. I responded, \"I didn't wish to interrupt you, as you appeared busy, sir.\" \"What have you been doing while I was away?\" \"Nothing in particular; teaching Adèle as usual.\" \"And looking considerably paler than you were – I noticed it instantly. What's wrong?\" \"Nothing at all, sir.\" \"Did you catch a cold that night you almost drowned me?\" \"Not in the least.\" \"Return to the drawing-room; you're leaving too early.\" \"I am tired, sir.\" He looked at me for a minute. \"And a little downcast,\" he said. \"What about? Tell me.\" \"Nothing – nothing, sir. I am not downcast.\" \"But I insist that you are; so downcast that a few more words would bring tears to your eyes – indeed, they are present now, bright and glistening; and a tear has slipped from your lash and fallen onto the flagstones.

I replied that I was well. Then he questioned why I hadn't approached him in the other room.

He noted that I looked much paler than before and asked what was wrong. I assured him nothing was wrong, nor had I caught a cold the night I saved him from nearly drowning.\n\nMr. Rochester instructed me to return to the drawing-room, saying I was leaving too soon. I told him I was tired. He looked at me for a moment, then remarked that I seemed rather down and asked why. I insisted there was nothing wrong, but he was adamant, saying I seemed so sad that I might cry, and he even saw a tear fall. He said that if he had more time and wasn't worried about servants overhearing, he would try to find out what was troubling me.

All sad feelings seemed now driven from the house, all gloomy associations forgotten: there was life everywhere, movement all day long. You could not now traverse the gallery, once so hushed, nor enter the front chambers, once so tenantless, without encountering a smart lady’s-maid or a dandy valet.\nThe kitchen, the butler’s pantry, the servants’ hall, the entrance hall, were equally alive; and the saloons were only left void and still when the blue sky and halcyon sunshine of the genial spring weather called their occupants out into the grounds. Even when that weather was broken, and continuous rain set in for some days, no damp seemed cast over enjoyment: indoor amusements only became more lively and varied, in consequence of the stop put to outdoor gaiety.\nI wondered what they were going to do the first evening a change of entertainment was proposed: they spoke of “playing charades,” but in my ignorance I did not understand the term. The servants were called in, the dining-room tables wheeled away, the lights otherwise disposed, the chairs placed in a semicircle opposite the arch. While Mr. Rochester and the other gentlemen directed these alterations, the ladies were running up and down stairs ringing for their maids. Mrs. Fairfax was summoned to give information respecting the resources of the house in shawls, dresses, draperies of any kind; and certain wardrobes of the third storey were ransacked, and their contents, in the shape of brocaded and hooped petticoats, satin sacques, black modes, lace lappets, &c., were brought down in armfuls by the abigails; then a selection was made, and such things as were chosen were carried to the boudoir within the drawing-room.\nMeantime, Mr. Rochester had again summoned the ladies round him, and was selecting certain of their number to be of his party. “Miss Ingram is mine, of course,” said he: afterwards he named the two Misses Eshton, and Mrs. Dent. He looked at me: I happened to be near him, as I had been fastening the clasp of Mrs. Dent’s bracelet, which had got loose.\n“Will you play?” he asked. I shook my head. He did not insist, which I rather feared he would have done; he allowed me to return quietly to my usual seat.\nHe and his aids now withdrew behind the curtain: the other party, which was headed by Colonel Dent, sat down on the crescent of chairs. One of the gentlemen, Mr. Eshton, observing me, seemed to propose that I should be asked to join them; but Lady Ingram instantly negatived the notion.\n“No,” I heard her say: “she looks too stupid for any game of the sort.”",
          "paraphrase_gemini-2.5-flash-preview-04-17": "These days at Thornfield Hall were enjoyable and full of activity, a stark contrast to the first three months I had spent there in quietness, sameness, and isolation. All feelings of sadness and negative associations seemed to have vanished from the house, replaced by constant energy and motion throughout the day. Now, when you walked through the gallery, which used to be silent, or entered the front rooms, once empty, you would inevitably encounter a well-dressed lady's maid or a fashionable valet. The kitchen, butler’s pantry, servants’ hall, and the main entrance hall were equally full of life. The drawing-rooms were only deserted when the clear skies and pleasant sunshine of the warm spring weather drew their occupants outdoors into the grounds. Even when the weather turned bad and it rained continuously for several days, it didn't dampen the spirits; indoor activities simply became more energetic and diverse because outdoor fun was impossible. I was curious about what they planned to do on the first evening when a different kind of amusement was suggested. They mentioned 'playing charades,' a term I didn't understand due to my lack of knowledge. The servants were called in, the dining tables were moved away, the lights were rearranged, and chairs were set up in a semicircle facing the archway. While Mr. Rochester and the other gentlemen were directing these preparations, the ladies were rushing up and down stairs summoning their maids. Mrs. Fairfax was consulted for information about the house's supply of shawls, dresses, and fabrics of any sort. Certain wardrobes on the third floor were searched, and their contents, such as brocaded and hooped petticoats, satin jackets, black bonnets, lace trims, and so on, were brought down in large quantities by the maids. Then, items were selected, and the chosen pieces were taken to the small room next to the drawing-room. Meanwhile, Mr. Rochester had gathered the ladies around him again and was choosing members for his team. He declared, \"Miss Ingram is definitely on my team,\" and then named the two Misses Eshton and Mrs. Dent. He looked at me; I happened to be standing nearby because I had been fixing the clasp of Mrs. Dent's bracelet, which had come undone. \"Will you play?\" he asked. I shook my head in refusal. He didn't insist, which I had somewhat feared he might do; he allowed me to return quietly to my usual seat. He and those he had chosen then went behind the curtain. The other group, led by Colonel Dent, sat down on the curved arrangement of chairs. One of the gentlemen, Mr. Eshton, seeing me, appeared to suggest that I should be invited to join them, but Lady Ingram immediately dismissed the idea. \"No,\" I overheard her say, \"she seems too dull for any game like that.\"",

All traces of sadness had vanished from the house, and every space bustled with energy. Whereas once the galleries and front rooms were silent and empty, now one was sure to meet finely dressed maids or stylish valets. Every part of the house—the kitchen, butler’s pantry, servants’ hall, and entrance—was lively, and people only left the main rooms when the pleasant spring weather encouraged them outside. Even when rain kept everyone indoors, the cheerful spirit endured and indoor amusements grew even more varied and spirited as a result. \n\nOne evening, a new entertainment was suggested: playing charades, a term I did not understand. The servants were summoned, dining tables moved, lights rearranged, and chairs arranged in a semicircle. The men supervised the preparations while the women hurried to fetch costumes, with Mrs. Fairfax consulted about available garments and wardrobe storage upstairs opened to supply decorative clothing. Selected items were taken to a small sitting room beside the drawing room for use in the game.\n\nMeanwhile, Mr. Rochester gathered the ladies around him and selected participants for his team, including Miss Ingram, the two Misses Eshton, and Mrs. Dent. When he looked at me and asked if I would like to take part, I declined, and he did not press further, allowing me to return to my usual place. As the chosen group moved behind the curtain and the other team arranged themselves on the chairs, one gentleman seemed to suggest I join their party, but Lady Ingram immediately dismissed the idea, saying she thought I was not clever enough for this kind of game."

Then the striking figure of Miss Ingram entered, dressed in white, with a long veil and a wreath of roses on her head; at her side was Mr. Rochester. The two approached the table together and knelt, as Mrs. Dent and Louisa Eshton, also dressed in white, stood behind them. They then performed a silent ceremony, clearly acting out a wedding. After it ended, Colonel Dent and his group whispered among themselves briefly. Then the Colonel called out, “Bride!” Mr. Rochester bowed, and the curtain came down."

          "text_segment": "A considerable interval elapsed before it again rose. Its second rising displayed a more elaborately prepared scene than the last. The drawing-room, as I have before observed, was raised two steps above the dining-room, and on the top of the upper step, placed a yard or two back within the room, appeared a large marble basin, which I recognised as an ornament of the conservatory—where it usually stood, surrounded by exotics, and tenanted by gold fish—and whence it must have been transported with some trouble, on account of its size and weight.\nSeated on the carpet, by the side of this basin, was seen Mr. Rochester, costumed in shawls, with a turban on his head. His dark eyes and swarthy skin and Paynim features suited the costume exactly: he looked the very model of an Eastern emir, an agent or a victim of the bowstring. Presently advanced into view Miss Ingram. She, too, was attired in oriental fashion: a crimson scarf tied sash-like round the waist: an embroidered handkerchief knotted about her temples; her beautifully-moulded arms bare, one of them upraised in the act of supporting a pitcher, poised gracefully on her head. Both her cast of form and feature, her complexion and her general air, suggested the idea of some Israelitish princess of the patriarchal days; and such was doubtless the character she intended to represent.\nShe approached the basin, and bent over it as if to fill her pitcher; she again lifted it to her head. The personage on the well-brink now seemed to accost her; to make some request:—“She hasted, let down her pitcher on her hand, and gave him to drink.” From the bosom of his robe he then produced a casket, opened it and showed magnificent bracelets and earrings; she acted astonishment and admiration; kneeling, he laid the treasure at her feet; incredulity and delight were expressed by her looks and gestures; the stranger fastened the bracelets on her arms and the rings in her ears. It was Eliezer and Rebecca: the camels only were wanting.\nThe divining party again laid their heads together: apparently they could not agree about the word or syllable the scene illustrated. Colonel Dent, their spokesman, demanded “the tableau of the whole;” whereupon the curtain again descended.",
          "paraphrase_gemini-2.5-flash-preview-04-17": "A significant pause occurred before the scene was presented again. The second showing was more elaborately prepared than the first. The drawing-room, as mentioned previously, was elevated two steps above the dining-room. At the edge of the upper step, positioned a few feet back, was a large marble basin. I recognized it as an item from the conservatory, where it was usually found surrounded by exotic plants and containing goldfish. Its size and weight suggested it must have been moved with considerable difficulty.\nSitting on the floor next to the basin was Mr. Rochester, dressed in shawls and wearing a turban. His dark eyes, tanned skin, and 'Heathen' features were perfectly suited to the attire; he looked exactly like an Eastern ruler, possibly an agent or intended victim of execution by strangulation. Next, Miss Ingram came into view. She was also dressed in an oriental style, with a red scarf tied like a sash around her waist, and an embroidered cloth knotted around her temples. Her beautifully formed arms were bare, with one raised to support a pitcher balanced gracefully on her head. Her build, facial features, skin tone, and overall appearance brought to mind an ancient Israelite princess from biblical times, which was clearly the character she aimed to portray.\nShe approached the basin and leaned over it as if to fill her pitcher, then lifted it back to her head. The figure by the basin then appeared to speak to her, making a request. \"She quickly lowered her pitcher onto her hand and offered him a drink.\" He then produced a small box from within his robe, opened it, and displayed magnificent bracelets and earrings. She showed surprise and admiration. Kneeling, he placed the precious items at her feet; her expressions and movements conveyed disbelief mixed with delight. The stranger fastened the bracelets onto her arms and the earrings onto her ears. It was the scene of Eliezer and Rebecca, only the camels were missing.\nThe group attempting to guess the tableau huddled together again; they seemed unable to agree on which word or syllable the scene represented. Colonel Dent, acting as their spokesperson, requested to see \"the tableau of the entire word,\" and the curtain then fell once more.",
          "paraphrase_gpt-4.1-2025-04-14": "After a significant pause, the curtain rose again, revealing a more detailed scene than before. The drawing-room, which was higher than the dining-room by two steps, had, at the top, a large marble basin that I recognized from the conservatory, where it was usually surrounded by exotic plants and goldfish. Moving it must have been quite an effort due to its size and weight. Sitting on the carpet next to the bowl was Mr. Rochester, dressed in shawls and wearing a turban, looking like an Eastern ruler with his dark eyes and complexion. Soon, Miss Ingram appeared, dressed in a similar Eastern style: a red scarf wrapped around her waist, a decorated handkerchief on her head, and her bare arms—with one holding a jug balanced on her head. Her overall look suggested she was playing the part of a biblical princess, likely Rebecca. She approached the basin as if to fill her jug, then lifted it to her head again. Mr. Rochester, by the basin, seemed to speak to her and make a request. She lowered her jug and gave him a drink. He then took out a box from his robe, showing her beautiful bracelets and earrings, which she admired with surprise. Kneeling, he presented the jewelry to her, and she showed amazement and happiness. He then put the bracelets on her arms and the earrings in her ears, enacting the story of Eliezer and Rebecca—though camels were missing from the scene. The group trying to guess couldn't decide on the word or phrase the tableau represented. Colonel Dent, their leader, asked for the entire tableau, so the curtain fell again."

          "text_segment": "A sufficient interval having elapsed for the performers to resume their ordinary costume, they re-entered the dining-room. Mr. Rochester led in Miss Ingram; she was complimenting him on his acting.\n“Do you know,” said she, “that, of the three characters, I liked you in the last best? Oh, had you but lived a few years earlier, what a gallant gentleman-highwayman you would have made!”\n“Is all the soot washed from my face?” he asked, turning it towards her.\n“Alas! yes: the more’s the pity! Nothing could be more becoming to your complexion than that ruffian’s rouge.”\n“You would like a hero of the road then?”\n“An English hero of the road would be the next best thing to an Italian bandit; and that could only be surpassed by a Levantine pirate.”\n“Well, whatever I am, remember you are my wife; we were married an hour since, in the presence of all these witnesses.” She giggled, and her colour rose.\n“Now, Dent,” continued Mr. Rochester, “it is your turn.” And as the other party withdrew, he and his band took the vacated seats. Miss Ingram placed herself at her leader’s right hand; the other diviners filled the chairs on each side of him and her. I did not now watch the actors; I no longer waited with interest for the curtain to rise; my attention was absorbed by the spectators; my eyes, erewhile fixed on the arch, were now irresistibly attracted to the semicircle of chairs. What charade Colonel Dent and his party played, what word they chose, how they acquitted themselves, I no longer remember; but I still see the consultation which followed each scene: I see Mr. Rochester turn to Miss Ingram, and Miss Ingram to him; I see her incline her head towards him, till the jetty curls almost touch his shoulder and wave against his cheek; I hear their mutual whisperings; I recall their interchanged glances; and something even of the feeling roused by the spectacle returns in memory at this moment.\nI have told you, reader, that I had learnt to love Mr. Rochester: I could not unlove him now, merely because I found that he had ceased to notice me—because I might pass hours in his presence, and he would never once turn his eyes in my direction—because I saw all his attentions appropriated by a great lady, who scorned to touch me with the hem of her robes as she passed; who, if ever her dark and imperious eye fell on me by chance, would withdraw it instantly as from an object too mean to merit observation. I could not unlove him, because I felt sure he would soon marry this very lady—because I read daily in her a proud security in his intentions respecting her—because I witnessed hourly in him a style of courtship which, if careless and choosing rather to be sought than to seek, was yet, in its very carelessness, captivating, and in its very pride, irresistible.\nThere was nothing to cool or banish love in these circumstances, though much to create despair. Much too, you will think, reader, to engender jealousy: if a woman, in my position, could presume to be jealous of a woman in Miss Ingram’s. But I was not jealous: or very rarely;—the nature of the pain I suffered could not be explained by that word. Miss Ingram was a mark beneath jealousy: she was too inferior to excite the feeling. Pardon the seeming paradox; I mean what I say. She was very showy, but she was not genuine: she had a fine person, many brilliant attainments; but her mind was poor, her heart barren by nature: nothing bloomed spontaneously on that soil; no unforced natural fruit delighted by its freshness. She was not good; she was not original: she used to repeat sounding phrases from books: she never offered, nor had, an opinion of her own. She advocated a high tone of sentiment; but she did not know the sensations of sympathy and pity; tenderness and truth were not in her. Too often she betrayed this, by the undue vent she gave to a spiteful antipathy she had conceived against little Adèle: pushing her away with some contumelious epithet if she happened to approach her; sometimes ordering her from the room, and always treating her with coldness and acrimony. Other eyes besides mine watched these manifestations of character—watched them closely, keenly, shrewdly. Yes; the future bridegroom, Mr. Rochester himself, exercised over his intended a ceaseless surveillance; and it was from this sagacity—this guardedness of his—this perfect, clear consciousness of his fair one’s defects—this obvious absence of passion in his sentiments towards her, that my ever-torturing pain arose.\nI saw he was going to marry her, for family, perhaps political reasons, because her rank and connections suited him; I felt he had not given her his love, and that her qualifications were ill adapted to win from him that treasure. This was the point—this was where the nerve was touched and teased—this was where the fever was sustained and fed: she could not charm him.",
          "paraphrase_gemini-2.5-flash-preview-04-17": "After a suitable time for the performers to change back into their regular clothes, they returned to the dining room. Mr. Rochester led in Miss Ingram, who was complimenting his acting. She said to him, \"You know, out of the three parts, I liked you best in the last one. Oh, if only you had been born a few years earlier, what a dashing gentleman-highwayman you would have been!\" He asked, turning his face towards her, \"Has all the soot been washed off my face?\" \"Sadly, yes,\" she replied, \"and more's the pity! Nothing could have suited your complexion better than that villain's makeup.\" \"So you'd approve of a criminal from the road?\" \"An English highwayman would be the next best thing to an Italian bandit, and only a Levantine pirate could surpass that.\" \"Well, whatever I am,\" Mr. Rochester said, \"remember you are my wife; we were married an hour ago, with everyone here as witnesses.\" She giggled, and her face flushed. \"Now, Dent,\" Mr. Rochester continued, \"it's your turn.\" As the first group withdrew, he and his party took the empty seats. Miss Ingram positioned herself at her leader's right side; the other fortune-tellers occupied the chairs around them. I no longer watched the actors; I wasn't waiting with interest for the performance to start. My attention was captivated by the audience. My eyes, which had been fixed on the archway, were now irresistibly drawn to the curved line of chairs. I do not recall what charade Colonel Dent and his group performed, what word they chose, or how they fared. But I still remember the discussion that followed each scene: I see Mr. Rochester turning to Miss Ingram, and Miss Ingram to him; I see her tilt her head towards him until her dark curls nearly touched his shoulder and brushed his cheek; I hear their whispered conversations; I recall the glances they exchanged; and even some of the emotion the sight stirred in me returns to memory now. I have told you, reader, that I had grown to love Mr. Rochester. I could not stop loving him now, simply because I found that he no longer paid attention to me—because I could spend hours in his presence, and he would never once look my way—because I saw all his focus claimed by a grand lady who disdained touching me with the hem of her garment as she passed; who, if by chance her dark, haughty eyes ever met mine, would immediately avert them as from an object too insignificant to notice. I could not stop loving him because I was certain he would soon marry this very lady—because I observed in her daily a proud confidence in his intentions towards her—because I witnessed hourly in him a style of courtship which, though casual and preferring to be pursued than to pursue, was nonetheless captivating in its very casualness and irresistible in its very pride. There was nothing in these circumstances to diminish or extinguish my love, although there was much to cause despair. Much too, you might think, reader, to stir up jealousy: if a woman in my humble situation could even dare to be jealous of a woman in Miss Ingram's high station. But I was not jealous, or only very rarely; the nature of the pain I suffered could not be described by that word. Miss Ingram was beneath the level that could provoke jealousy; she was too inferior to arouse that feeling. Pardon the apparent contradiction; I mean what I say. She was very flashy but lacked authenticity; she had a fine appearance and many impressive accomplishments, but her mind was shallow, and her heart was naturally barren. Nothing blossomed spontaneously in that soil; no genuine, unforced fruit delighted with its freshness. She was not good; she was not original. She often repeated eloquent phrases from books and never offered, nor possessed, an opinion of her own. She advocated for noble sentiments but did not understand the feelings of sympathy and pity; tenderness and truth were not in her character. She revealed this too often by giving excessive expression to a spiteful aversion she had conceived against little Adèle, pushing her away with some contemptuous insult if she happened to approach her, sometimes ordering her out of the room, and always treating her with coldness and harshness. Other eyes besides mine observed these revelations of character—watched them closely, keenly, shrewdly. Yes; her future groom, Mr. Rochester himself, kept his intended under constant scrutiny. And it was from this insight—this guardedness of his—this perfect, clear understanding of his intended's flaws—this obvious lack of strong feeling in his sentiments towards her—that my ever-present, painful suffering arose. I saw he was going to marry her for family, perhaps political reasons, because her status and connections suited him. I sensed he had not given her his love and that her qualities were ill-suited to win that treasure from him. This was the key point—this was where my nerves were touched and tormented—this was what fueled and sustained my anguish: she could not truly captivate him.",
          "paraphrase_gpt-4.1-2025-04-14": "After enough time had passed for the performers to change back into regular clothes, they returned to the dining room. Mr. Rochester escorted Miss Ingram, who was praising his performance. She remarked, 'You know, of the three roles, I liked your last one best. If only you had lived a few years earlier, you’d have made a dashing highwayman!' Rochester joked, asking if all the makeup had been removed from his face, to which she lamented that it had, as the look suited him. They traded playful banter about his suitability as a highwayman or pirate, and Rochester reminded her that, according to their earlier charade, they had just been married in front of everyone. Miss Ingram laughed and blushed at this. Next, Rochester called on Colonel Dent’s group to perform. As the previous group vacated their seats, Rochester’s group took their places, with Miss Ingram sitting beside him. The other performers sat alongside them. At this point, my interest in watching the acts faded; instead, I observed the audience, my attention drawn to the seated group rather than the stage. I don’t recall what play Colonel Dent’s team put on or which word they enacted, but I can still picture the conversations after each scene: Rochester speaking with Miss Ingram, her head leaning towards him so her dark curls nearly touched him, their whispers and exchanged glances vivid in my memory, as well as the feelings these scenes stirred for me.\nI had already confessed, reader, that I loved Mr. Rochester: I couldn’t stop loving him just because he no longer paid me any attention—because I could spend hours near him without a glance in my direction—because all his focus was on a grand lady who ignored me and would shrink away from even the most accidental contact. I couldn’t stop loving him, even though I believed he would soon marry this lady—because I saw every day in her a proud confidence that he intended to propose—and each day I witnessed in him a style of courtship that, though offhand and prefering to be pursued rather than pursue, was nonetheless captivating and compelling in its indifference and pride.\nNothing in these circumstances could diminish my affection, though they did create hopelessness. You, reader, might think such a situation would give rise to jealousy, but that wasn’t exactly my pain; Miss Ingram didn’t even inspire jealousy in me. She was not worthy of it—beneath it. Admittedly, she was impressive and accomplished, but I found her shallow and insincere. Her mind was weak, her heart empty; nothing genuine or spontaneous came from her. She wasn’t kind or original; she repeated phrases from books and lacked independent thought. She promoted lofty ideals but was incapable of true empathy or compassion. Her lack of real feelings was obvious, especially in how she treated Adèle with cruelty and disdain, sometimes even banishing the child from the room. I was not alone in noticing these flaws—others, including Mr. Rochester, watched her closely. It was apparent that, while he may have planned to marry her for social or political reasons, he did not love her; she lacked the qualities that could ever earn his regard. This was the most painful truth: despite appearances, she could not truly captivate him."

If Miss Ingram had been a good and noble woman, endowed with force, fervour, kindness, sense, I should have had one vital struggle with two tigers—jealousy and despair: then, my heart torn out and devoured, I should have admired her—acknowledged her excellence, and been quiet for the rest of my days: and the more absolute her superiority, the deeper would have been my admiration—the more truly tranquil my quiescence. But as matters really stood, to watch Miss Ingram’s efforts at fascinating Mr. Rochester, to witness their repeated failure—herself unconscious that they did fail; vainly fancying that each shaft launched hit the mark, and infatuatedly pluming herself on success, when her pride and self-complacency repelled further and further what she wished to allure—to witness this, was to be at once under ceaseless excitation and ruthless restraint.\nBecause, when she failed, I saw how she might have succeeded. Arrows that continually glanced off from Mr. Rochester’s breast and fell harmless at his feet, might, I knew, if shot by a surer hand, have quivered keen in his proud heart—have called love into his stern eye, and softness into his sardonic face; or, better still, without weapons a silent conquest might have been won.\n“Why can she not influence him more, when she is privileged to draw so near to him?” I asked myself. “Surely she cannot truly like him, or not like him with true affection! If she did, she need not coin her smiles so lavishly, flash her glances so unremittingly, manufacture airs so elaborate, graces so multitudinous. It seems to me that she might, by merely sitting quietly at his side, saying little and looking less, get nigher his heart. I have seen in his face a far different expression from that which hardens it now while she is so vivaciously accosting him; but then it came of itself: it was not elicited by meretricious arts and calculated manoeuvres; and one had but to accept it—to answer what he asked without pretension, to address him when needful without grimace—and it increased and grew kinder and more genial, and warmed one like a fostering sunbeam. How will she manage to please him when they are married? I do not think she will manage it; and yet it might be managed; and his wife might, I verily believe, be the very happiest woman the sun shines on.”\nI have not yet said anything condemnatory of Mr. Rochester’s project of marrying for interest and connections. It surprised me when I first discovered that such was his intention: I had thought him a man unlikely to be influenced by motives so commonplace in his choice of a wife; but the longer I considered the position, education, &c., of the parties, the less I felt justified in judging and blaming either him or Miss Ingram for acting in conformity to ideas and principles instilled into them, doubtless, from their childhood. All their class held these principles: I supposed, then, they had reasons for holding them such as I could not fathom. It seemed to me that, were I a gentleman like him, I would take to my bosom only such a wife as I could love; but the very obviousness of the advantages to the husband’s own happiness offered by this plan convinced me that there must be arguments against its general adoption of which I was quite ignorant: otherwise I felt sure all the world would act as I wished to act.\nBut in other points, as well as this, I was growing very lenient to my master: I was forgetting all his faults, for which I had once kept a sharp look-out. It had formerly been my endeavour to study all sides of his character: to take the bad with the good; and from the just weighing of both, to form an equitable judgment. Now I saw no bad. The sarcasm that had repelled, the harshness that had startled me once, were only like keen condiments in a choice dish: their presence was pungent, but their absence would be felt as comparatively insipid. And as for the vague something—was it a sinister or a sorrowful, a designing or a desponding expression?—that opened upon a careful observer, now and then, in his eye, and closed again before one could fathom the strange depth partially disclosed; that something which used to make me fear and shrink, as if I had been wandering amongst volcanic-looking hills, and had suddenly felt the ground quiver and seen it gape: that something, I, at intervals, beheld still; and with throbbing heart, but not with palsied nerves. Instead of wishing to shun, I longed only to dare—to divine it; and I thought Miss Ingram happy, because one day she might look into the abyss at her leisure, explore its secrets and analyse their nature.",
          "paraphrase_gemini-2.5-flash-preview-04-17": "Had she achieved an immediate triumph, with him completely surrendering his heart to her, I would have metaphorically covered my face, turned away, and ceased to exist for them. If Miss Ingram had been a virtuous and dignified woman, possessing strength, passion, kindness, and good judgment, I would have faced a significant internal battle against two intense emotions—envy and hopelessness. After having my heart painfully consumed by these feelings, I would have admired her, acknowledged her superiority, and remained quiet for the remainder of my days. The more undeniable her excellence, the deeper my admiration would have been, and the more genuinely peaceful my acceptance. But given the actual circumstances, witnessing Miss Ingram's persistent attempts to charm Mr. Rochester and seeing them repeatedly fail—while she remained oblivious to her failures, deluding herself that every effort succeeded, and narcissistically congratulating herself on achievements when her arrogance and smugness only pushed away the object of her desires—observing this kept me in a state of perpetual inner turmoil combined with strict self-restraint. This was because I could see how she might have succeeded where she failed. The attempts that repeatedly bounced harmlessly off Mr. Rochester's emotional defenses and fell inconsequentially at his feet could, I knew, have deeply affected his proud heart, sparked affection in his stern eyes, and softened his mocking expression, had they been delivered with greater skill. Or even better, a silent connection, without overt efforts, might have won him over. 'Why can she not influence him more, given her proximity?' I wondered. 'Surely she doesn't truly care for him, or her affection isn't genuine! If it were, she wouldn't need to overuse her smiles, flash her glances incessantly, or contrive such elaborate mannerisms and excessive graces. It seems to me that she might get closer to his heart simply by sitting quietly beside him, saying little and looking less. I have seen a very different look on his face than the one it wears now while she is so energetically talking to him. But that look came naturally; it wasn't elicited by artificial tricks or calculated strategies. One only had to accept it – answer his questions without pretension, address him when necessary without false expressions – and it would deepen, becoming warmer and more benevolent, like a comforting sunbeam. How will she manage to please him when they are married? I don't believe she will succeed, yet it is possible, and his wife could, I truly think, be the happiest woman alive.' I haven't yet criticized Mr. Rochester's plan to marry for wealth and status. It surprised me initially to learn this was his intention; I had thought him someone unlikely to be swayed by such common motivations in choosing a spouse. However, the more I considered the backgrounds, upbringing, etc., of both individuals, the less I felt justified in judging or blaming either him or Miss Ingram for adhering to principles and ideas likely instilled in them since childhood. Their entire social class upheld these values, so I assumed they had reasons for doing so that I couldn't comprehend. It seemed to me that, were I a gentleman like him, I would marry only someone I could love. But the very obviousness of the benefits to the husband's personal happiness offered by his plan convinced me there must be reasons against its universal adoption that I was unaware of; otherwise, I felt sure everyone would act as I wished to act. But in this, as in other respects, I was becoming much more forgiving towards my master. I was forgetting all his faults, which I had once watched closely. I had formerly tried to understand every aspect of his character, taking the negative with the positive, and forming a balanced judgment by fairly weighing both. Now, I saw no negatives. The sarcasm that had once put me off, the harshness that had startled me, now seemed merely like sharp spices in a fine dish—their presence was intense, but their absence would make things seem comparatively bland. And as for that vague quality—was it sinister or sad, scheming or despondent?—that would occasionally appear to a careful observer in his eye, only to disappear before one could fully grasp the strange depth it partially revealed; that quality which used to make me fearful and recoil, as if I had been exploring volcanic-looking hills and suddenly felt the ground shake and saw it crack open: I still saw that quality at times, and with a racing heart, but no longer with trembling nerves. Instead of wanting to avoid it, I only yearned to confront it—to understand its mystery. And I considered Miss Ingram fortunate, because one day she might leisurely gaze into that abyss, explore its secrets, and analyze their nature.",
          "paraphrase_gpt-4.1-2025-04-14": "If Miss Ingram had quickly won Mr. Rochester's heart and he had sincerely offered his love to her, I would have been so overwhelmed that I would have retreated from their lives, feeling as though I had emotionally died to them. Had she been genuinely good and admirable—possessing strength, passion, and kindness—I would have had a painful internal battle against jealousy and despair. After enduring that ordeal, I would have respected and admired her goodness, accepting the situation with lasting calm, the more so if she were clearly superior. But as things actually were, I saw Miss Ingram repeatedly try, and fail, to captivate Mr. Rochester, all the while unaware of her lack of success, believing she had charmed him when her pride and self-importance only pushed him away further. Observing this filled me with a mix of restless energy and rigid self-control.\n\nSeeing her fail, I realized how someone else might succeed; her efforts fell flat against Mr. Rochester, but in the hands of a more skilled person, those same actions might have touched his heart, inspired affection, and softened his demeanor. Or perhaps, without obvious effort, a true connection could have been made in silence. I wondered why she could not reach him, even though she was so close; perhaps she did not really care for him, or not enough. If she truly loved him, she would not have to try so hard with forced smiles, constant looks, or elaborate manners. I felt she might have reached him more deeply just by quietly being with him. I had seen his face soften in the past through simple, natural interaction—no manipulation involved—which made him kinder and warmer. I doubted she would make him happy in marriage, though I believed it was possible, and that his wife could be the happiest woman alive.\n\nI have yet to criticize Mr. Rochester for considering marriage based on social gain and connections. I was surprised when I realized this was his plan, as I thought he would not be swayed by such common motives. But the more I considered their social standing and upbringing, the less I felt justified in judging either him or Miss Ingram for acting according to the expectations instilled in them since childhood. These values were shared by their entire class, so they must have reasons I didn't understand. Personally, I believed I would only marry for love, but since this seemed such an obvious path to happiness, I supposed there must be reasons why others did not do the same—otherwise, surely everyone would act as I wished to.\n\nIn general, I noticed I was becoming much more forgiving towards Mr. Rochester, no longer watching for his flaws as carefully as I once had. I used to weigh the good with the bad to form a fair judgment, but now I overlooked his faults entirely. The sarcasm and harshness that once put me off now seemed like spices—making his character more lively, and without them, he might even seem dull. As for the mysterious quality in his expression—sometimes sinister or sorrowful, cunning or sad—that used to frighten me, I still saw it on occasion, but with curiosity rather than fear. Instead of wishing to avoid it, I wanted to understand and explore it. I even thought Miss Ingram fortunate, imagining she might someday have the opportunity to uncover and examine these depths fully."

The Ladies Lynn and Ingram continued to consort in solemn conferences, where they nodded their two turbans at each other, and held up their four hands in confronting gestures of surprise, or mystery, or horror, according to the theme on which their gossip ran, like a pair of magnified puppets. Mild Mrs. Dent talked with good-natured Mrs. Eshton; and the two sometimes bestowed a courteous word or smile on me. Sir George Lynn, Colonel Dent, and Mr. Eshton discussed politics, or county affairs, or justice business. Lord Ingram flirted with Amy Eshton; Louisa played and sang to and with one of the Messrs. Lynn; and Mary Ingram listened languidly to the gallant speeches of the other. Sometimes all, as with one consent, suspended their by-play to observe and listen to the principal actors: for, after all, Mr. Rochester and—because closely connected with him—Miss Ingram were the life and soul of the party. If he was absent from the room an hour, a perceptible dulness seemed to steal over the spirits of his guests; and his re-entrance was sure to give a fresh impulse to the vivacity of conversation.\nThe want of his animating influence appeared to be peculiarly felt one day that he had been summoned to Millcote on business, and was not likely to return till late. The afternoon was wet: a walk the party had proposed to take to see a gipsy camp, lately pitched on a common beyond Hay, was consequently deferred. Some of the gentlemen were gone to the stables: the younger ones, together with the younger ladies, were playing billiards in the billiard-room. The dowagers Ingram and Lynn sought solace in a quiet game at cards. Blanche Ingram, after having repelled, by supercilious taciturnity, some efforts of Mrs. Dent and Mrs. Eshton to draw her into conversation, had first murmured over some sentimental tunes and airs on the piano, and then, having fetched a novel from the library, had flung herself in haughty listlessness on a sofa, and prepared to beguile, by the spell of fiction, the tedious hours of absence. The room and the house were silent: only now and then the merriment of the billiard-players was heard from above.\nIt was verging on dusk, and the clock had already given warning of the hour to dress for dinner, when little Adèle, who knelt by me in the drawing-room window-seat, suddenly exclaimed—\n“Voilà Monsieur Rochester, qui revient!”\nI turned, and Miss Ingram darted forwards from her sofa: the others, too, looked up from their several occupations; for at the same time a crunching of wheels and a splashing tramp of horse-hoofs became audible on the wet gravel. A post-chaise was approaching.\n“What can possess him to come home in that style?” said Miss Ingram. “He rode Mesrour (the black horse), did he not, when he went out? and Pilot was with him:—what has he done with the animals?”\nAs she said this, she approached her tall person and ample garments so near the window, that I was obliged to bend back almost to the breaking of my spine: in her eagerness she did not observe me at first, but when she did, she curled her lip and moved to another casement. The post-chaise stopped; the driver rang the door-bell, and a gentleman alighted attired in travelling garb; but it was not Mr. Rochester; it was a tall, fashionable-looking man, a stranger.\n“How provoking!” exclaimed Miss Ingram: “you tiresome monkey!” (apostrophising Adèle), “who perched you up in the window to give false intelligence?” and she cast on me an angry glance, as if I were in fault.\nSome parleying was audible in the hall, and soon the new-comer entered. He bowed to Lady Ingram, as deeming her the eldest lady present.\n“It appears I come at an inopportune time, madam,” said he, “when my friend, Mr. Rochester, is from home; but I arrive from a very long journey, and I think I may presume so far on old and intimate acquaintance as to instal myself here till he returns.”\nHis manner was polite; his accent, in speaking, struck me as being somewhat unusual,—not precisely foreign, but still not altogether English: his age might be about Mr. Rochester’s,—between thirty and forty; his complexion was singularly sallow: otherwise he was a fine-looking man, at first sight especially. On closer examination, you detected something in his face that displeased, or rather that failed to please. His features were regular, but too relaxed: his eye was large and well cut, but the life looking out of it was a tame, vacant life—at least so I thought.",
          "paraphrase_gemini-2.5-flash-preview-04-17": "While I was absorbed solely in thoughts of my employer and his prospective bride – only seeing them, listening to their conversations, and considering their actions significant – the other guests pursued their individual interests and pastimes. Ladies Lynn and Ingram continued their serious discussions, nodding their turbans at each other and using their hands to express surprise, mystery, or horror, depending on their subject, like oversized puppets. Gentle Mrs. Dent conversed with kind Mrs. Eshton, occasionally offering me a polite word or smile. Sir George Lynn, Colonel Dent, and Mr. Eshton discussed politics, local county matters, or legal affairs. Lord Ingram flirted with Amy Eshton; Louisa played and sang with one of the Messrs. Lynn; and Mary Ingram listened listlessly to the compliments of the other Mr. Lynn. At times, the entire group paused their separate activities to watch and listen to the main figures, Mr. Rochester and Miss Ingram (due to her close connection with him), as they were undeniably the central focus and energy of the gathering. If he was absent from the room for even an hour, a noticeable dullness seemed to settle over the guests, and his return was sure to instantly re-energise the conversation. His absence seemed particularly noticeable one day when he was called away to Millcote on business and wasn't expected back until late. The afternoon was rainy, so a planned walk to see a recently established gypsy camp on a common near Hay had to be cancelled. Some of the gentlemen had gone to the stables; the younger guests were playing billiards in the billiard room. The dowagers, Mrs. Ingram and Mrs. Lynn, found comfort in a quiet card game. Blanche Ingram, after brushing off attempts by Mrs. Dent and Mrs. Eshton to engage her in conversation with disdainful silence, first played some melancholic tunes on the piano. Then, retrieving a novel from the library, she threw herself onto a sofa in a display of arrogant boredom, intending to pass the tedious hours of Rochester's absence by reading fiction. The room and the house were quiet, with only the occasional sound of laughter from the billiard players upstairs. It was getting close to dusk, and the clock had already indicated it was time to get ready for dinner, when little Adèle, who was kneeling beside me on the window seat in the drawing-room, suddenly cried out, \"Look, Mr. Rochester is coming back!\" I turned, and Miss Ingram sprang forward from her sofa. The others also looked up from what they were doing, as at that moment, the sound of carriage wheels crunching on the wet gravel and splashing horse hooves became audible. A post-chaise was approaching. \"What reason can he have for returning in that manner?\" exclaimed Miss Ingram. \"He rode Mesrour (the black horse), didn't he, when he left? And Pilot was with him - what has he done with the animals?\" As she spoke, her tall figure and voluminous dress came so close to the window that I had to lean back, almost straining my back. In her eagerness, she didn't notice me at first, but when she did, she curled her lip and moved to another window. The post-chaise stopped, the driver rang the doorbell, and a gentleman dressed in travelling clothes stepped out; however, it wasn't Mr. Rochester. It was a tall, stylish-looking man, a stranger. \"How frustrating!\" cried Miss Ingram. \"You annoying little monkey!\" (addressing Adèle), \"who put you in the window to give false information?\" And she shot me an angry look, as if I were somehow responsible. Some talking was heard in the hall, and soon the newcomer entered. He bowed to Lady Ingram, seemingly considering her the most senior lady present. \"It appears I arrive at an inconvenient time, madam,\" he said, \"as my friend, Mr. Rochester, is away from home. But I am at the end of a very long journey, and I believe I can presume upon our old and close acquaintance enough to make myself at home here until he returns.\" His manner was polite. His speaking accent struck me as slightly unusual, not quite foreign, but not entirely English either. His age seemed comparable to Mr. Rochester's, between thirty and forty. His complexion was notably sallow. Otherwise, he was a handsome man, particularly at first glance. Upon closer inspection, you could detect something in his face that was displeasing, or rather, failed to please. His features were regular, but lacked firmness. His eye was large and well-shaped, but the expression in it was bland and empty - at least, that was my impression.",

Sir George Lynn, Colonel Dent, and Mr. Eshton discussed matters of politics or local business. Lord Ingram flirted with Amy Eshton, Louisa played music with one of the Lynn brothers, while Mary Ingram halfheartedly listened to the other's compliments. At times, all attention would shift to Mr. Rochester and Miss Ingram, who were the central figures of the party; his absence made the group noticeably less lively, and his return always revived the energy in the room.\n\nOne rainy afternoon, when Mr. Rochester was away on business and wouldn’t return until late, the planned walk to a nearby gypsy camp had to be postponed.

Confused, Miss Ingram commented that Mr. Rochester had left on horseback, so why was he returning by carriage? She moved close to the window, crowding me in her excitement, until she noticed and then disdainfully moved away. When the carriage stopped and a gentleman, not Mr. Rochester, got out, Miss Ingram was annoyed, blaming Adèle for the false excitement and glaring at me as if it were my fault.\n\nAfter some discussion in the hall, the newcomer entered, politely greeting Lady Ingram and explaining that, as an old friend of Mr. Rochester, he hoped he could stay until his arrival, given his long journey. Although well-mannered and attractive at first, on closer inspection he seemed somewhat unappealing; his features were regular, but too relaxed, and his eyes, though well-shaped, appeared dull and listless, at least in my opinion."

          "text_segment": "The sound of the dressing-bell dispersed the party. It was not till after dinner that I saw him again: he then seemed quite at his ease. But I liked his physiognomy even less than before: it struck me as being at the same time unsettled and inanimate. His eye wandered, and had no meaning in its wandering: this gave him an odd look, such as I never remembered to have seen. For a handsome and not an unamiable-looking man, he repelled me exceedingly: there was no power in that smooth-skinned face of a full oval shape: no firmness in that aquiline nose and small cherry mouth; there was no thought on the low, even forehead; no command in that blank, brown eye.\nAs I sat in my usual nook, and looked at him with the light of the girandoles on the mantelpiece beaming full over him—for he occupied an arm-chair drawn close to the fire, and kept shrinking still nearer, as if he were cold, I compared him with Mr. Rochester. I think (with deference be it spoken) the contrast could not be much greater between a sleek gander and a fierce falcon: between a meek sheep and the rough-coated keen-eyed dog, its guardian.\nHe had spoken of Mr. Rochester as an old friend. A curious friendship theirs must have been: a pointed illustration, indeed, of the old adage that “extremes meet.”\nTwo or three of the gentlemen sat near him, and I caught at times scraps of their conversation across the room. At first I could not make much sense of what I heard; for the discourse of Louisa Eshton and Mary Ingram, who sat nearer to me, confused the fragmentary sentences that reached me at intervals. These last were discussing the stranger; they both called him “a beautiful man.” Louisa said he was “a love of a creature,” and she “adored him;” and Mary instanced his “pretty little mouth, and nice nose,” as her ideal of the charming.\n“And what a sweet-tempered forehead he has!” cried Louisa,—“so smooth—none of those frowning irregularities I dislike so much; and such a placid eye and smile!”\nAnd then, to my great relief, Mr. Henry Lynn summoned them to the other side of the room, to settle some point about the deferred excursion to Hay Common.\nI was now able to concentrate my attention on the group by the fire, and I presently gathered that the new-comer was called Mr. Mason; then I learned that he was but just arrived in England, and that he came from some hot country: which was the reason, doubtless, his face was so sallow, and that he sat so near the hearth, and wore a surtout in the house. Presently the words Jamaica, Kingston, Spanish Town, indicated the West Indies as his residence; and it was with no little surprise I gathered, ere long, that he had there first seen and become acquainted with Mr. Rochester. He spoke of his friend’s dislike of the burning heats, the hurricanes, and rainy seasons of that region. I knew Mr. Rochester had been a traveller: Mrs. Fairfax had said so; but I thought the continent of Europe had bounded his wanderings; till now I had never heard a hint given of visits to more distant shores.\nI was pondering these things, when an incident, and a somewhat unexpected one, broke the thread of my musings. Mr. Mason, shivering as some one chanced to open the door, asked for more coal to be put on the fire, which had burnt out its flame, though its mass of cinder still shone hot and red. The footman who brought the coal, in going out, stopped near Mr. Eshton’s chair, and said something to him in a low voice, of which I heard only the words, “old woman,”—“quite troublesome.”\n“Tell her she shall be put in the stocks if she does not take herself off,” replied the magistrate.\n“No—stop!” interrupted Colonel Dent. “Don’t send her away, Eshton; we might turn the thing to account; better consult the ladies.” And speaking aloud, he continued—“Ladies, you talked of going to Hay Common to visit the gipsy camp; Sam here says that one of the old Mother Bunches is in the servants’ hall at this moment, and insists upon being brought in before ‘the quality,’ to tell them their fortunes. Would you like to see her?”",
          "paraphrase_gemini-2.5-flash-preview-04-17": "The sound of the bell announcing it was time to dress before dinner broke up the gathering. It wasn't until after the meal that I saw him again; at that point, he seemed quite comfortable. However, I found his face even less appealing than before; it struck me as being simultaneously restless and expressionless. His eyes shifted around without any purpose, giving him an unusual look I'd never encountered. Despite being a handsome and not unpleasant-looking man, he created a strong sense of aversion in me. There was no strength in his smooth, full-oval face; no firmness in his aquiline nose or small, cherry-red mouth; no sign of deep thought on his low, level forehead; and no authority in his empty, brown eyes. As I sat in my usual spot, observing him with the light from the candelabra on the mantelpiece shining directly on him – for he was seated in an armchair pulled close to the fire, and kept moving even nearer as if he were cold – I compared him to Mr. Rochester. I believe (speaking respectfully) the contrast could hardly have been greater than between a sleek gander and a fierce falcon, or between a gentle sheep and the sturdy, sharp-eyed dog protecting it. He had mentioned Mr. Rochester as a long-time friend. Their friendship must have been peculiar, truly a perfect example of the old saying that \"opposites attract.\" Two or three gentlemen were seated near him, and I occasionally caught fragments of their conversation from across the room. Initially, I couldn't make much sense of what I heard because the talk of Louisa Eshton and Mary Ingram, who were closer to me, jumbled the scattered sentences that reached me intermittently. Louisa and Mary were discussing the stranger; both referred to him as \"a beautiful man.\" Louisa called him \"a darling creature\" and said she \"adored him,\" while Mary pointed to his \"lovely little mouth and nice nose\" as her standard of charm. \"And what a pleasant-looking forehead he has!\" exclaimed Louisa, adding, \"so smooth – none of those lines from frowning that I dislike so much; and such calm eyes and a placid smile!\" Then, to my great relief, Mr. Henry Lynn called them over to the other side of the room to settle a detail about the postponed outing to Hay Common. I was now able to concentrate on the group by the fire, and I soon gathered that the newcomer's name was Mr. Mason. Next, I learned he had only recently arrived in England and had come from a hot climate. This, no doubt, explained his pale complexion, his sitting so close to the hearth, and his wearing an overcoat indoors. Soon, words like Jamaica, Kingston, and Spanish Town identified the West Indies as his residence. It was with considerable surprise that I understood, before long, that he had first met and become acquainted with Mr. Rochester there. He spoke of his friend's dislike for the intense heat, the hurricanes, and the rainy periods of that region. I knew Mr. Rochester had traveled; Mrs. Fairfax had mentioned it; but I had thought his journeys were confined to the European continent. Until now, I had never heard any suggestion of visits to more distant places. I was contemplating these things when an event, and a rather unexpected one, interrupted my train of thought. Mr. Mason, shivering when someone happened to open the door, requested more coal be added to the fire, which had stopped flaming, although the large mass of embers still glowed hot and red. The footman who brought the coal, on his way out, paused near Mr. Eshton's chair and said something quietly to him. I only managed to hear the words \"old woman\" and \"quite troublesome.\" \"Tell her she'll be put in the public stocks if she doesn't leave,\" replied the magistrate. \"No, wait!\" interrupted Colonel Dent. \"Don't send her away, Eshton; we might be able to use this; it's better to consult the ladies.\" Speaking out loud, he continued, \"Ladies, you mentioned going to Hay Common to visit the gypsy camp; Sam here says that one of the old Mother Bunches is in the servants' hall right now and insists on being brought before 'the quality' to tell their fortunes. Would you like to see her?\"",
          "paraphrase_gpt-4.1-2025-04-14": "The ringing of the dressing-bell caused everyone to disperse. I didn’t see him again until after dinner, and then he appeared much more comfortable. However, I found his appearance even less agreeable than before; his features seemed both restless and lifeless. His gaze wandered meaninglessly, giving him a strange look I had never encountered. Despite his good looks and generally pleasant expression, he strongly repelled me: his smooth, oval face lacked any authority; his straight nose and small red mouth had no strength; his low, smooth forehead showed no sign of intelligence, and his dull brown eye lacked any command.\n\nAs I sat in my usual spot and watched him in the light shining from the mantelpiece—he was sitting in an armchair close to the fire, inching ever nearer as if he felt cold—I mentally compared him to Mr. Rochester. The difference between them, I thought, could not be greater, like that between a well-cared-for goose and a wild hawk, or between a gentle sheep and the rugged dog guarding it.\n\nHe had referred to Mr. Rochester as an old friend. Their friendship must have been a curious one—a true example of the saying that ‘opposites attract.’\n\nSeveral other gentlemen sat near him, and from time to time, I overheard scraps of their conversation, though I couldn’t make sense of everything because the chatter of Louisa Eshton and Mary Ingram nearby muddled what I could hear. The two women were discussing the newcomer, both calling him ‘a handsome man.’ Louisa claimed he was ‘adorable’ and that she loved him, while Mary admired his small mouth and nice nose as her ideal of attractiveness.\n\n‘And what a sweet-looking forehead he has!’ Louisa cried out—‘so smooth—none of those frowned lines I so dislike; and such a calm eye and smile!’\n\nThen, to my relief, Mr. Henry Lynn called the ladies to the other side of the room to discuss plans for the postponed outing to Hay Common.\n\nNow able to focus on the group by the fire, I soon learned the newcomer’s name was Mr. Mason; he had just arrived in England and came from a hot country, which probably explained his pale complexion, why he sat so close to the fire, and why he wore an overcoat indoors. Soon, names like Jamaica, Kingston, and Spanish Town made it clear he lived in the West Indies; and I was surprised to discover, before long, that he first met Mr. Rochester there. He mentioned Mr. Rochester’s dislike of the relentless heat, storms, and rainy weather typical of that area. I knew Mr. Rochester had travelled—Mrs. Fairfax had said so—but I assumed he had only visited Europe; I had never heard of him journeying further until now.\n\nI was reflecting on all this when something unexpected interrupted my thoughts. Mr. Mason, shivering as someone opened the door, asked for more coal to be added to the fire, which had lost its flame, though the embers still glowed red. As the footman who brought the coal was leaving, he paused by Mr. Eshton’s chair and said something quietly, from which I only caught the words ‘old woman’ and ‘quite troublesome.’\n\n‘Tell her she’ll be put in the stocks if she doesn’t leave,’ answered the magistrate.\n\n‘Wait—don’t send her away, Eshton,’ Colonel Dent interjected. ‘She might be useful; perhaps we should consult with the ladies.’ Then, raising his voice to address the room, he added, ‘Ladies, you mentioned wanting to visit the gypsy camp at Hay Common; Sam tells us that one of the old Mother Bunches is in the servants’ hall right now and insists on being brought before you all to tell your fortunes. Would you like to see her?’"

I must show her into a room by herself, and then those who wish to consult her must go to her one by one.”\n“You see now, my queenly Blanche,” began Lady Ingram, “she encroaches. Be advised, my angel girl—and—”\n“Show her into the library, of course,” cut in the “angel girl.” “It is not my mission to listen to her before the vulgar herd either: I mean to have her all to myself. Is there a fire in the library?”\n“Yes, ma’am—but she looks such a tinkler.”\n“Cease that chatter, blockhead! and do my bidding.”\nAgain Sam vanished; and mystery, animation, expectation rose to full flow once more.\n“She’s ready now,” said the footman, as he reappeared. “She wishes to know who will be her first visitor.”\n“I think I had better just look in upon her before any of the ladies go,” said Colonel Dent.\n“Tell her, Sam, a gentleman is coming.”\nSam went and returned.\n“She says, sir, that she’ll have no gentlemen; they need not trouble themselves to come near her; nor,” he added, with difficulty suppressing a titter, “any ladies either, except the young, and single.”\n“By Jove, she has taste!” exclaimed Henry Lynn.\nMiss Ingram rose solemnly: “I go first,” she said, in a tone which might have befitted the leader of a forlorn hope, mounting a breach in the van of his men.\n“Oh, my best! oh, my dearest! pause—reflect!” was her mama’s cry; but she swept past her in stately silence, passed through the door which Colonel Dent held open, and we heard her enter the library.\nA comparative silence ensued.",

By all means, get rid of her immediately!\" The footman replied, \"But I can't convince her to leave, my lady, and neither can any of the servants. Mrs. Fairfax is with her right now, begging her to go, but she's taken a seat by the fire and says nothing will make her move until she's allowed in here.\" \"What does she want?\" asked Mrs. Eshton. \"'To tell the fortunes of the gentlefolk,' she claims, ma'am, and she insists she must and will do it.\" \"What does she look like?\" the Misses Eshton inquired together. \"A dreadfully ugly old creature, miss, almost as dark as a cooking pot.\" \"Well, she's a real witch!\" cried Frederick Lynn. \"Let's bring her in, of course.\" \"Absolutely,\" his brother agreed; \"it would be a shame to waste such an opportunity for entertainment.\" \"My dear boys, what are you even considering?\" exclaimed Mrs. Lynn. \"I absolutely cannot condone such an inappropriate action,\" added the Dowager Ingram. \"Indeed, Mother, you can and you will,\" Blanche declared in her imperious voice, turning from the piano stool where she had been silently examining sheet music. \"I am curious to have my fortune told, so, Sam, order the old hag to come forward.\" \"My sweet Blanche! Remember—\" \"I do—I remember everything you might suggest, and I will have my way—quickly, Sam!\" \"Yes—yes—yes!\" shouted all the young people, ladies and gentlemen alike. \"Let her come—it will be wonderful fun!\" The footman hesitated. \"She looks like a rough sort,\" he said. \"Go!\" ordered Miss Ingram, and the man departed. The entire group was instantly buzzing with excitement; a constant stream of teasing and jokes was flowing when Sam returned. \"She won't come here now,\" he reported. \"She says it's not her calling to appear before the 'common crowd' (those are her exact words). I have to take her to a room by herself, and then those who wish to consult her must go to her one at a time.\" \"You see now, my majestic Blanche,\" Lady Ingram began, \"she is becoming demanding. Listen to my advice, my precious girl—and—\" \"Show her into the library, naturally,\" the \"precious girl\" interrupted. \"It is not my calling to listen to her before the common crowd either; I intend to have her all to myself. Is there a fire in the library?\" \"Yes, ma'am—but she does look like a rough character.\" \"Stop that foolish talk, you simpleton! And do as I tell you.\" Sam vanished again, and mystery, energy, and anticipation swelled once more. \"She's ready now,\" the footman announced upon reappearing. \"She wants to know who her first visitor will be.\" \"I think I should just check on her before any of the ladies go,\" said Colonel Dent. \"Tell her, Sam, a gentleman is coming.\" Sam went and returned. \"She says, sir, that she won't see any gentlemen; they don't need to bother coming near her, nor,\" he added, barely suppressing a chuckle, \"any ladies either, unless they are young and unmarried.\" \"By Jove, she has taste!\" exclaimed Henry Lynn. Miss Ingram rose dramatically. \"I go first,\" she stated in a tone befitting a leader of a desperate charge, scaling a barrier at the head of his soldiers. \"Oh, my dearest! Oh, my darling! Pause—consider!\" was her mother's plea, but she swept past her in silent dignity, walked through the door Colonel Dent held open, and they heard her enter the library. A relative quiet settled over the remaining group.",
          "paraphrase_gpt-4.1-2025-04-14": "Lady Ingram protested to the colonel that he shouldn’t tolerate such a lowly fraud and insisted she be dismissed immediately. The footman explained that he and the other servants couldn’t get her to leave, saying that Mrs. Fairfax was currently with the woman, pleading with her, but she had settled herself in a chair by the hearth, refusing to move until she was allowed in. Mrs. Eshton asked what the woman wanted, and the footman replied that she claimed she wanted to tell the fortunes of the gentry and insisted upon it. The Eshton sisters eagerly asked what she looked like, and he described her as a terribly ugly old woman, as black as a pot. Frederick Lynn declared she must be a real witch and suggested they should definitely bring her in, his brother echoing him and saying it would be a pity to miss such entertainment. Mrs. Lynn objected anxiously to the idea, and the Dowager Ingram agreed. Blanche, however, asserted that her mother could and would allow it, since she herself was curious to have her fortune told, and so ordered Sam, the footman, to have the woman brought in despite protests. The younger guests all excitedly agreed, urging Sam to proceed. Sam hesitated, saying the woman seemed rough, but Miss Ingram sharply told him to go, and he left. The party became lively with jokes and anticipation until Sam returned to report that the woman refused to appear before such a group, insisting she would only see people alone, one at a time. Lady Ingram tried to dissuade Blanche, but Blanche interrupted, directing Sam to take the woman to the library, saying she wanted her fortune told in private. Sam remarked that the woman still seemed disreputable, but Blanche brushed him off and demanded he do as she said. Sam left again, and excitement in the group rose until he returned to say the woman was ready and wanted to know who her first visitor would be. Colonel Dent suggested he ought to see her first, but Sam returned with the message that the woman would see no gentlemen, nor any ladies except the unmarried and young. Henry Lynn joked that she had good taste. Miss Ingram then stood up and announced she would go first, despite her mother’s pleas. She crossed the room with determination and entered the library, after which a hush fell over the group."

How do you feel? Is she a real fortune-teller?” demanded the Misses Eshton.\n“Now, now, good people,” returned Miss Ingram, “don’t press upon me. Really your organs of wonder and credulity are easily excited: you seem, by the importance of you all—my good mama included—ascribe to this matter, absolutely to believe we have a genuine witch in the house, who is in close alliance with the old gentleman. I have seen a gipsy vagabond; she has practised in hackneyed fashion the science of palmistry and told me what such people usually tell. My whim is gratified; and now I think Mr. Eshton will do well to put the hag in the stocks to-morrow morning, as he threatened.”\nMiss Ingram took a book, leant back in her chair, and so declined further conversation. I watched her for nearly half-an-hour: during all that time she never turned a page, and her face grew momently darker, more dissatisfied, and more sourly expressive of disappointment. She had obviously not heard anything to her advantage: and it seemed to me, from her prolonged fit of gloom and taciturnity, that she herself, notwithstanding her professed indifference, attached undue importance to whatever revelations had been made her.\nMeantime, Mary Ingram, Amy and Louisa Eshton, declared they dared not go alone; and yet they all wished to go. A negotiation was opened through the medium of the ambassador, Sam; and after much pacing to and fro, till, I think, the said Sam’s calves must have ached with the exercise, permission was at last, with great difficulty, extorted from the rigorous Sibyl, for the three to wait upon her in a body.\nTheir visit was not so still as Miss Ingram’s had been: we heard hysterical giggling and little shrieks proceeding from the library; and at the end of about twenty minutes they burst the door open, and came running across the hall, as if they were half-scared out of their wits.\n“I am sure she is something not right!” they cried, one and all. “She told us such things! She knows all about us!” and they sank breathless into the various seats the gentlemen hastened to bring them.\nPressed for further explanation, they declared she had told them of things they had said and done when they were mere children; described books and ornaments they had in their boudoirs at home: keepsakes that different relations had presented to them. They affirmed that she had even divined their thoughts, and had whispered in the ear of each the name of the person she liked best in the world, and informed them of what they most wished for.\nHere the gentlemen interposed with earnest petitions to be further enlightened on these two last-named points; but they got only blushes, ejaculations, tremors, and titters, in return for their importunity.

Would she treat it as a joke? Everyone looked at her with eager curiosity, and she responded to their gaze with one of coldness and dismissal. She looked neither upset nor cheerful. She walked rigidly to her seat and sat down in silence. “Well, Blanche?” Lord Ingram asked. “What did she say, sister?” Mary inquired. “What did you think? How do you feel? Is she a real fortune-teller?” the Misses Eshton demanded. “Now, now, calm down, everyone,” Miss Ingram replied, “don't crowd me. Honestly, your capacity for wonder and belief is easily stirred. It seems, judging by the importance you all—including my good mother—are giving this matter, that you truly believe we have a genuine witch in the house who is in league with the devil. I have seen a common travelling woman; she has performed the tired, usual tricks of palm reading and told me what such people typically say. My curiosity has been satisfied; and now I think Mr. Eshton would be wise to put the old woman in the public stocks tomorrow morning, as he threatened.” Miss Ingram picked up a book, leaned back in her chair, and thus indicated she would not discuss the matter further. I watched her for nearly half an hour. Throughout that time, she didn't turn a single page, and her face became progressively darker, more discontented, and more bitterly expressive of disappointment. She had clearly not heard anything favourable, and it appeared to me, from her prolonged state of gloom and silence, that she herself, despite claiming indifference, attached excessive importance to whatever predictions had been given to her. In the meantime, Mary Ingram, Amy and Louisa Eshton declared they were too afraid to go alone, and yet they all wished to go. A negotiation was arranged through the messenger, Sam, and after much pacing back and forth, until I believe Sam's leg muscles must have ached from the effort, permission was finally, with great difficulty, obtained from the strict fortune-teller for the three of them to visit her together. Their visit was not as quiet as Miss Ingram's had been; we heard excited giggling and small screams coming from the library. After about twenty minutes, they burst the door open and ran across the hall as if they were completely terrified. “I am certain she is something not normal!” they all exclaimed together. “She told us such things! She knows everything about us!” and they collapsed breathlessly into the various seats the gentlemen quickly brought for them. When pressed for more details, they explained she had told them about things they had said and done when they were just children; described books and decorative items they had in their private rooms at home; and mentioned mementos given to them by different relatives. They insisted that she had even guessed their thoughts and had whispered in the ear of each the name of the person she cared about most in the world, and informed them of what they most wished for. At this point, the gentlemen made earnest requests for further information on these last two points; but in response to their persistence, they only received blushes, exclamations, trembling, and nervous giggling. Meanwhile, the older ladies offered smelling salts and used their fans, repeatedly stating their concern that their warning had not been taken in time. The older gentlemen laughed, and the younger ones eagerly offered their help to the agitated young ladies.",

Lord Ingram asked, 'Well, Blanche?' and Mary wanted to know what happened. The Eshton girls also questioned her about the fortune-teller. Miss Ingram told everyone not to interrogate her, teasing them for believing so easily, including her mother, that a real witch was present. She explained that she had simply met a gypsy who told her the usual things fortune-tellers say, and that now she was satisfied, suggesting that Mr. Eshton should lock the woman up the next morning as threatened. Then she picked up a book, leaned back, and refused to talk further. The narrator watched Miss Ingram for almost half an hour; she didn’t turn a page and her mood became increasingly sour and disappointed, indicating she hadn’t heard anything favorable, and in spite of pretending not to care, she was affected by what the fortune-teller had said."

She had on a red cloak and a black bonnet: or rather, a broad-brimmed gipsy hat, tied down with a striped handkerchief under her chin. An extinguished candle stood on the table; she was bending over the fire, and seemed reading in a little black book, like a prayer-book, by the light of the blaze: she muttered the words to herself, as most old women do, while she read; she did not desist immediately on my entrance: it appeared she wished to finish a paragraph.\nI stood on the rug and warmed my hands, which were rather cold with sitting at a distance from the drawing-room fire. I felt now as composed as ever I did in my life: there was nothing indeed in the gipsy’s appearance to trouble one’s calm. She shut her book and slowly looked up; her hat-brim partially shaded her face, yet I could see, as she raised it, that it was a strange one. It looked all brown and black: elf-locks bristled out from beneath a white band which passed under her chin, and came half over her cheeks, or rather jaws: her eye confronted me at once, with a bold and direct gaze.\n“Well, and you want your fortune told?” she said, in a voice as decided as her glance, as harsh as her features.\n“I don’t care about it, mother; you may please yourself: but I ought to warn you, I have no faith.”\n“It’s like your impudence to say so: I expected it of you; I heard it in your step as you crossed the threshold.”\n“Did you? You’ve a quick ear.”\n“I have; and a quick eye and a quick brain.”\n“You need them all in your trade.”\n“I do; especially when I’ve customers like you to deal with. Why don’t you tremble?”\n“I’m not cold.”\n“Why don’t you turn pale?”\n“I am not sick.”\n“Why don’t you consult my art?”\n“I’m not silly.”",

The woman, whom they called the Sibyl (though I wasn't sure if that was accurate), sat comfortably in an easy chair by the fireplace. She wore a red cloak and a black bonnet, or more accurately, a broad-brimmed gipsy hat secured under her chin with a striped handkerchief. An unlit candle stood on the table. She was leaning over the fire, seemingly reading from a small black book that looked like a prayer book, using the firelight. As she read, she mumbled the words to herself, as many older women do. She didn't stop immediately when I came in; she seemed to want to finish the section. I stood on the rug and warmed my hands, which were rather chilled from sitting far from the drawing-room fire. I felt as composed now as I ever did; truly, there was nothing in the gipsy's look to disrupt one's calmness. She closed her book and slowly looked up. Her hat brim partially obscured her face, but as she raised it, I could see her face was peculiar. It looked entirely brown and dark. Tangles of hair (like 'elf-locks') jutted out from under a white band that went beneath her chin and came half over her cheeks, or rather her jaws. Her eye immediately met mine with a bold and direct stare. \"Well, and you've come for your fortune told?\" she asked, her voice as firm as her gaze and as rough as her features. \"I don't care about it, mother; you can do as you please, but I should warn you, I have no belief in it.\" \"How insolent of you to say so! I expected it; I heard it in your steps as you crossed the doorway.\" \"Did you? You have sharp hearing.\" \"I do, and keen eyesight, and a quick mind.\" \"You must need all of them for your profession.\" \"I do, especially with clients like you. Why aren't you trembling?\" \"I'm not cold.\" \"Why aren't you turning pale?\" \"I'm not ill.\" \"Why aren't you asking me to practice my art?\" \"I'm not foolish.\"",

She leaned over the fire, seemingly reading from a small black book that resembled a prayer-book, lit only by the flames; she murmured the words as she read, as elderly women often do. She continued reading even when I walked in, wanting to finish her paragraph. I stood on the rug to warm my cold hands, which had become chilled from sitting far from the drawing-room fire. I felt as calm as ever, for nothing about the gypsy's look disturbed me. She finally closed her book and looked up at me slowly; her face was partially hidden by her hat but as she lifted her head I saw it was unusual—brown and black, with wild, tangled hair poking out from under a white band tied beneath her chin and along her jaws; her eyes met mine directly and fearlessly. \"So, you want your fortune told?\" she asked, her voice as strong and rough as her appearance.\n\n\"I don't really care for it, ma'am; you may do as you like, but I should tell you I'm not a believer.\"\n\n\"Typical for you to say that,\" she replied. \"I expected it—I could tell from your footsteps as you walked in.\"\n\n\"Could you? You must be observant.\"\n\n\"I am: I have sharp eyes, ears, and mind.\"\n\n\"I suppose you need those for your work.\"\n\n\"Absolutely: especially with customers like you.

The utmost I hope is, to save money enough out of my earnings to set up a school some day in a little house rented by myself.”\n“A mean nutriment for the spirit to exist on: and sitting in that window-seat (you see I know your habits)—”\n“You have learned them from the servants.”\n“Ah! you think yourself sharp. Well, perhaps I have: to speak truth, I have an acquaintance with one of them, Mrs. Poole—”\nI started to my feet when I heard the name.\n“You have—have you?” thought I; “there is diablerie in the business after all, then!”\n“Don’t be alarmed,” continued the strange being; “she’s a safe hand is Mrs. Poole: close and quiet; any one may repose confidence in her. But, as I was saying: sitting in that window-seat, do you think of nothing but your future school? Have you no present interest in any of the company who occupy the sofas and chairs before you? Is there not one face you study? one figure whose movements you follow with at least curiosity?”\n“I like to observe all the faces and all the figures.”\n“But do you never single one from the rest—or it may be, two?”\n“I do frequently; when the gestures or looks of a pair seem telling a tale: it amuses me to watch them.”\n“What tale do you like best to hear?”\n“Oh, I have not much choice! They generally run on the same theme—courtship; and promise to end in the same catastrophe—marriage.”\n“And do you like that monotonous theme?”\n“Positively, I don’t care about it: it is nothing to me.”\n“Nothing to you? When a lady, young and full of life and health, charming with beauty and endowed with the gifts of rank and fortune, sits and smiles in the eyes of a gentleman you—”\n“I what?”\n“You know—and perhaps think well of.”\n“I don’t know the gentlemen here. I have scarcely interchanged a syllable with one of them; and as to thinking well of them, I consider some respectable, and stately, and middle-aged, and others young, dashing, handsome, and lively: but certainly they are all at liberty to be the recipients of whose smiles they please, without my feeling disposed to consider the transaction of any moment to me.”\n“You don’t know the gentlemen here? You have not exchanged a syllable with one of them? Will you say that of the master of the house!”\n“He is not at home.”\n“A profound remark! A most ingenious quibble! He went to Millcote this morning, and will be back here to-night or to-morrow: does that circumstance exclude him from the list of your acquaintance—blot him, as it were, out of existence?”\n“No; but I can scarcely see what Mr. Rochester has to do with the theme you had introduced.”\n“I was talking of ladies smiling in the eyes of gentlemen; and of late so many smiles have been shed into Mr. Rochester’s eyes that they overflow like two cups filled above the brim: have you never remarked that?”\n“Mr. Rochester has a right to enjoy the society of his guests.”\n“No question about his right: but have you never observed that, of all the tales told here about matrimony, Mr. Rochester has been favoured with the most lively and the most continuous?”\n“The eagerness of a listener quickens the tongue of a narrator.” I said this rather to myself than to the gipsy, whose strange talk, voice, manner, had by this time wrapped me in a kind of dream.

'I often feel weary, sometimes sleepy, but rarely unhappy,' I replied. 'Then you must have some hidden hope to lift your spirits and excite you with thoughts of the future?' she probed.

One person whose actions you follow with at least some curiosity?' 'I enjoy observing all the faces and figures,' I answered.

'Yes, I frequently do, when a couple's gestures or expressions seem to be narrating a story; I find it amusing to watch them,' I admitted. 'What kind of story do you prefer to hear?' she asked. 'Oh, I don't have much choice! They generally revolve around the same topic - courtship - and seem destined to conclude in the same outcome - marriage,' I replied. 'And do you find that repetitive theme enjoyable?' she inquired. 'Honestly, I don't care about it at all; it means nothing to me,' I stated. 'Nothing to you? When a young lady, vibrant and healthy, beautiful and blessed with high status and wealth, sits and smiles into the eyes of a gentleman you...' 'I what?' I interjected. 'You know - and perhaps think well of,' she finished. 'I don't know the gentlemen here,' I clarified. 'I have barely spoken a word to any of them. As for thinking well of them, I consider some to be respectable, dignified, and middle-aged, and others young, stylish, attractive, and lively. But they are certainly all free to accept smiles from whomever they wish, without my feeling that the interaction is of any consequence to me.' 'You don't know the gentlemen here? You haven't exchanged a syllable with one of them? Will you claim that about the master of the house!' she challenged. 'He isn't here,' I replied. 'A profound observation! A remarkably clever evasion! He went to Millcote this morning and will return tonight or tomorrow; does that fact exclude him from the list of your acquaintances - effectively erasing him from existence?' she retorted. 'No, but I can hardly see what Mr. Rochester has to do with the subject you introduced,' I said. 'I was discussing ladies smiling into the eyes of gentlemen; and recently, so many smiles have been directed into Mr. Rochester's eyes that they are overflowing like two cups filled above the brim. Have you never noticed that?' she explained. 'The enthusiasm of a listener encourages the speaker's tongue,' I said this more to myself than to the gipsy, whose strange conversation, voice, and manner had by this point left me in a state of bewilderment. One unexpected remark followed another until I felt entangled in a web of mystery, wondering what invisible presence had been observing my heart for weeks, watching its activities and recording every beat.",

She looked at me for a moment and wondered aloud what thoughts I had while spending hours with the elegant guests in the drawing room, comparing them to fleeting, insubstantial images, without meaningful connection. I replied that I often felt tired or sleepy, but not really sad. She asked if I had any secret hopes for the future. I said my only wish was to save up enough money to one day open my own school. She called this a poor source of spiritual nourishment and mentioned she knew I liked to sit in a certain window seat, hinting she knew my habits through the servants, specifically Mrs. Poole, which startled me. She reassured me that Mrs. Poole was trustworthy. Then she asked if, when I sat there, I thought only of my future school, or if I took any interest in any of the guests—was there anyone I observed more closely? I answered that I liked to observe everyone, but sometimes watched those whose interactions seemed to tell a story, usually of courtship and marriage, though I didn't care much for these themes. She pressed further, asking about my feelings towards any specific gentleman, like the master of the house. I replied that Mr. Rochester was away and that regardless, I barely knew the other men, nor did their interactions with the ladies matter to me. She pointedly mentioned the many smiles given to Mr. Rochester and asked if I’d noticed, suggesting he was often the subject of romantic attention. I responded that a keen listener encourages more storytelling, but the gypsy’s odd manner had drawn me into a dreamlike state where I wondered if some unseen presence had been observing and recording my feelings."

I cannot remember detecting gratitude in his face.”\n“Detecting! You have analysed, then. And what did you detect, if not gratitude?”\nI said nothing.\n“You have seen love: have you not?—and, looking forward, you have seen him married, and beheld his bride happy?”\n“Humph! Not exactly. Your witch’s skill is rather at fault sometimes.”\n“What the devil have you seen, then?”\n“Never mind: I came here to inquire, not to confess. Is it known that Mr. Rochester is to be married?”\n“Yes; and to the beautiful Miss Ingram.”\n“Shortly?”\n“Appearances would warrant that conclusion: and, no doubt (though, with an audacity that wants chastising out of you, you seem to question it), they will be a superlatively happy pair. He must love such a handsome, noble, witty, accomplished lady; and probably she loves him, or, if not his person, at least his purse. I know she considers the Rochester estate eligible to the last degree; though (God pardon me!) I told her something on that point about an hour ago which made her look wondrous grave: the corners of her mouth fell half an inch. I would advise her blackaviced suitor to look out: if another comes, with a longer or clearer rent-roll,—he’s dished—”\n“But, mother, I did not come to hear Mr. Rochester’s fortune: I came to hear my own; and you have told me nothing of it.”\n“Your fortune is yet doubtful: when I examined your face, one trait contradicted another. Chance has meted you a measure of happiness: that I know. I knew it before I came here this evening. She has laid it carefully on one side for you. I saw her do it. It depends on yourself to stretch out your hand, and take it up: but whether you will do so, is the problem I study. Kneel again on the rug.”\n“Don’t keep me long; the fire scorches me.”\nI knelt. She did not stoop towards me, but only gazed, leaning back in her chair. She began muttering,—\n“The flame flickers in the eye; the eye shines like dew; it looks soft and full of feeling; it smiles at my jargon: it is susceptible; impression follows impression through its clear sphere; where it ceases to smile, it is sad; an unconscious lassitude weighs on the lid: that signifies melancholy resulting from loneliness. It turns from me; it will not suffer further scrutiny; it seems to deny, by a mocking glance, the truth of the discoveries I have already made,—to disown the charge both of sensibility and chagrin: its pride and reserve only confirm me in my opinion. The eye is favourable.\n“As to the mouth, it delights at times in laughter; it is disposed to impart all that the brain conceives; though I daresay it would be silent on much the heart experiences. Mobile and flexible, it was never intended to be compressed in the eternal silence of solitude: it is a mouth which should speak much and smile often, and have human affection for its interlocutor. That feature too is propitious.\n“I see no enemy to a fortunate issue but in the brow; and that brow professes to say,—‘I can live alone, if self-respect, and circumstances require me so to do. I need not sell my soul to buy bliss. I have an inward treasure born with me, which can keep me alive if all extraneous delights should be withheld, or offered only at a price I cannot afford to give.’ The forehead declares, ‘Reason sits firm and holds the reins, and she will not let the feelings burst away and hurry her to wild chasms. The passions may rage furiously, like true heathens, as they are; and the desires may imagine all sorts of vain things: but judgment shall still have the last word in every argument, and the casting vote in every decision. Strong wind, earthquake-shock, and fire may pass by: but I shall follow the guiding of that still small voice which interprets the dictates of conscience.’\n“Well said, forehead; your declaration shall be respected. I have formed my plans—right plans I deem them—and in them I have attended to the claims of conscience, the counsels of reason. I know how soon youth would fade and bloom perish, if, in the cup of bliss offered, but one dreg of shame, or one flavour of remorse were detected; and I do not want sacrifice, sorrow, dissolution—such is not my taste. I wish to foster, not to blight—to earn gratitude, not to wring tears of blood—no, nor of brine: my harvest must be in smiles, in endearments, in sweet—That will do. I think I rave in a kind of exquisite delirium. I should wish now to protract this moment ad infinitum; but I dare not. So far I have governed myself thoroughly. I have acted as I inwardly swore I would act; but further might try me beyond my strength. Rise, Miss Eyre: leave me; ‘the play is played out.’”",
          "paraphrase_gemini-2.5-flash-preview-04-17": "“An eager listener!” she repeated, “Yes, Mr. Rochester has spent hours with his ear close to those captivating lips that clearly enjoyed communicating so much. And Mr. Rochester was so willing to hear and seemed so thankful for the entertainment she provided; you noticed this, didn't you?” “Thankful! I don't recall seeing thankfulness on his face.” “Seeing! So you analysed him? What did you see, if not gratitude?” I didn't respond. “You've seen love, haven't you? And looking ahead, you've pictured him married and his bride being happy?” “Hmm, not exactly. Your fortune-telling ability seems to miss the mark sometimes.” “What on earth did you see, then?” “Never mind that. I came here to ask questions, not to reveal things about myself. Is it known that Mr. Rochester is getting married?” “Yes, to the beautiful Miss Ingram.” “Soon?” “All signs point to that conclusion, and undoubtedly (even though you, with surprising boldness, seem to doubt it), they will be an incredibly happy couple. He must surely love such an attractive, noble, witty, and accomplished lady, and she probably loves him, or if not him, at least his money. I know she considers the Rochester estate highly desirable, although (Heaven help me!) I said something to her about that about an hour ago that made her look very serious; the corners of her mouth dropped half an inch. I'd advise her dark-complexioned admirer to be cautious; if someone with a larger or clearer income arrives, he's finished.” “But, madam, I didn't come to hear about Mr. Rochester's future; I came to hear about my own, and you haven't told me anything.” “Your future is still uncertain. When I examined your face, some features contradicted others. Fate has assigned you a measure of happiness, I know that. I knew it before coming here tonight. Fate has carefully set it aside for you. I saw it happen. It depends on you reaching out and claiming it, but whether you will do so is the question I'm contemplating. Kneel on the rug again.” “Please don't keep me long; the fire is too hot.” I knelt down. She didn't lean towards me but just stared, leaning back in her chair. She began murmuring quietly, “There's a flicker in the eye; the eye shines like dew; it looks soft and full of feeling; it seems amused by my words. It's sensitive; impressions pass through its clear surface easily. When it stops smiling, it looks sad; an unconscious weariness rests on the lid, indicating sadness resulting from loneliness. It turns away from me; it won't allow further close inspection. With a teasing look, it seems to deny the truth of the things I've already found—to reject being seen as both sensitive and unhappy. Its pride and reserve only confirm my assessment. The eye is promising. As for the mouth, it sometimes enjoys laughter; it is inclined to express everything the mind thinks, though I expect it would remain silent about much that the heart feels. Expressive and adaptable, it was never meant to be confined by the perpetual silence of solitude. It is a mouth that should speak often and smile frequently, receiving human affection from those it talks to. That feature is also favourable. I see no obstacle to a happy outcome except in the brow. And that brow seems to say, 'I can live alone if self-respect and circumstances require me to. I don't need to compromise my principles to gain happiness. I have an inner strength within me that can sustain me even if all external pleasures are withheld or offered only at a price I cannot afford.' The forehead declares, 'Reason is firmly in control, guiding everything and preventing emotions from breaking loose and rushing her into dangerous situations. Passions may rage fiercely, like untamed forces, as they are, and desires may imagine all sorts of foolish things, but judgment will still have the final word in every debate and the decisive vote in every choice. Strong winds, earthquake tremors, and fire may pass by, but I will follow the guidance of that quiet inner voice which interprets the dictates of conscience.' Well spoken, forehead; your declaration shall be respected. I have made my plans—which I believe are the correct ones—and in them I have taken into account the demands of conscience and the advice of reason. I know how quickly youth would fade and beauty perish if, in the happiness offered, even one trace of shame or one hint of regret were found. And I do not want sacrifice, sorrow, or destruction—that is not what I desire. I want to nurture, not destroy—to earn gratitude, not cause deep suffering. No, not even tears of sadness. My reward must come from smiles, affection, and pleasant things. That's enough. I think I'm speaking in a kind of intense dreamlike state. I would like to extend this moment indefinitely, but I must not. So far, I have maintained complete control of myself. I have acted exactly as I internally vowed I would, but going further might test me beyond my ability. Stand up, Miss Eyre. Leave me; 'the performance is over.'",

I know how quickly youth would fade if happiness contained even a drop of shame or remorse. I want gratitude, not pain, in return. My rewards must be smiles, affection, sweetness—that's enough. I'm in a kind of happy daze. I'd love to hold onto this moment forever, but I shouldn't. So far, I've kept my resolve; to go further might be too much. Stand up, Miss Eyre: we're finished here.\""

It was not at all the withered hand of an old person but a smooth, curved limb with graceful, evenly shaped fingers.

I assume I may leave now?\" \"No,\" he said, \"stay a moment; and tell me what the people in the drawing-room are doing.\" \"Discussing the gypsy, I imagine,\" she offered. \"Sit down!\" he commanded, \"Let me hear what they said about me.\" Jane hesitated, \"I shouldn't stay long, sir; it must be close to eleven. Oh, are you aware, Mr. Rochester, that a visitor has arrived here since you departed this morning?\" \"A stranger!\" he exclaimed, surprised, \"no; who could it be? I wasn't expecting anyone; has he left?\" \"No,\" she explained, \"he mentioned he had known you for a long time and felt he could take the liberty of staying here until you returned.\" \"The devil he did!\" Rochester burst out, \"Did he give his name?\" \"His name is Mason, sir,\" Jane replied, \"and he is from the West Indies; from Spanish Town, in Jamaica, I believe.\" Mr. Rochester was standing near her, and he had taken her hand, as if to guide her to a chair.",
          "paraphrase_gpt-4.1-2025-04-14": "\"That’s quite an odd notion to have, sir!\"\n\"But I pulled it off well, didn’t I? Don’t you agree?\"\n\"You must have fooled the ladies successfully.\"\n\"But not you?\"\n\"You didn’t really pretend to be a gypsy when you spoke to me.\"\n\"Then what was I pretending to be? Myself?\"\n\"No, you took on some strange role. Honestly, I think you were just trying to get a reaction out of me, to make me talk nonsense since you were speaking nonsense yourself. That’s hardly fair.\"\n\"Will you forgive me, Jane?\"\n\"I’m not sure yet. I need to think about it first. If I decide I didn’t make too much of a fool of myself, then I’ll try to forgive you. But it still wasn’t right.\"\n\"But you were perfectly proper and sensible.\"\nI thought about it and, overall, I agreed—I hadn’t behaved badly. That was reassuring, especially since I had suspected something was off from the start. I knew fortune-tellers didn’t talk like that, and I recognized the fake voice and the efforts to hide her face. My thoughts, though, had been preoccupied with Grace Poole, who I considered an unsolvable mystery. I never guessed it was Mr. Rochester.\n\n\"So,\" he said, \"what are you thinking about? What does that serious little smile mean?\"\n\"I’m feeling a bit amazed, and a little proud of myself. May I leave now, sir?\"\n\"No, wait a bit. Tell me what everyone in the drawing-room is doing.\"\n\"Probably talking about the gypsy, I’d bet.\"\n\"Sit down! I want to hear what they said about me.\"\n\"I shouldn’t stay long, sir—it must be nearly eleven. By the way, did you know a stranger arrived here after you left this morning?\"\n\"A stranger? No, who is it? Was I expecting anybody? Have they gone?\"\n\"No, he said he’s known you for years and felt comfortable waiting here for you to return.\"\n\"Really! Did he give his name?\"\n\"His name is Mason, sir. He’s from the West Indies—Spanish Town, Jamaica, I believe.\"\nMr. Rochester was standing next to me, holding my hand as if to guide me to a chair."

The consequence was, that when the moon, which was full and bright (for the night was fine), came in her course to that space in the sky opposite my casement, and looked in at me through the unveiled panes, her glorious gaze roused me. Awaking in the dead of night, I opened my eyes on her disk—silver-white and crystal clear. It was beautiful, but too solemn: I half rose, and stretched my arm to draw the curtain.\nGood God! What a cry!\nThe night—its silence—its rest, was rent in twain by a savage, a sharp, a shrilly sound that ran from end to end of Thornfield Hall.\nMy pulse stopped: my heart stood still; my stretched arm was paralysed. The cry died, and was not renewed. Indeed, whatever being uttered that fearful shriek could not soon repeat it: not the widest-winged condor on the Andes could, twice in succession, send out such a yell from the cloud shrouding his eyrie. The thing delivering such utterance must rest ere it could repeat the effort.\nIt came out of the third storey; for it passed overhead. And overhead—yes, in the room just above my chamber-ceiling—I now heard a struggle: a deadly one it seemed from the noise; and a half-smothered voice shouted—\n“Help! help! help!” three times rapidly.\n“Will no one come?” it cried; and then, while the staggering and stamping went on wildly, I distinguished through plank and plaster:—\n“Rochester! Rochester! for God’s sake, come!”\nA chamber-door opened: some one ran, or rushed, along the gallery. Another step stamped on the flooring above and something fell; and there was silence.\nI had put on some clothes, though horror shook all my limbs; I issued from my apartment. The sleepers were all aroused: ejaculations, terrified murmurs sounded in every room; door after door unclosed; one looked out and another looked out; the gallery filled. Gentlemen and ladies alike had quitted their beds; and “Oh! what is it?”—“Who is hurt?”—“What has happened?”—“Fetch a light!”—“Is it fire?”—“Are there robbers?”—“Where shall we run?” was demanded confusedly on all hands. But for the moonlight they would have been in complete darkness. They ran to and fro; they crowded together: some sobbed, some stumbled: the confusion was inextricable.\n“Where the devil is Rochester?” cried Colonel Dent. “I cannot find him in his bed.”\n“Here! here!” was shouted in return. “Be composed, all of you: I’m coming.”\nAnd the door at the end of the gallery opened, and Mr. Rochester advanced with a candle: he had just descended from the upper storey. One of the ladies ran to him directly; she seized his arm: it was Miss Ingram.\n“What awful event has taken place?” said she. “Speak! let us know the worst at once!”\n“But don’t pull me down or strangle me,” he replied: for the Misses Eshton were clinging about him now; and the two dowagers, in vast white wrappers, were bearing down on him like ships in full sail.\n“All’s right!—all’s right!” he cried. “It’s a mere rehearsal of Much Ado about Nothing. Ladies, keep off, or I shall wax dangerous.”\nAnd dangerous he looked: his black eyes darted sparks. Calming himself by an effort, he added—\n“A servant has had the nightmare; that is all. She’s an excitable, nervous person: she construed her dream into an apparition, or something of that sort, no doubt; and has taken a fit with fright. Now, then, I must see you all back into your rooms; for, till the house is settled, she cannot be looked after. Gentlemen, have the goodness to set the ladies the example. Miss Ingram, I am sure you will not fail in evincing superiority to idle terrors. Amy and Louisa, return to your nests like a pair of doves, as you are. Mesdames” (to the dowagers), “you will take cold to a dead certainty, if you stay in this chill gallery any longer.”\nAnd so, by dint of alternate coaxing and commanding, he contrived to get them all once more enclosed in their separate dormitories.",
          "paraphrase_gemini-2.5-flash-preview-04-17": "I had forgotten to pull my curtains and window-blind closed, which I usually did. As a result, when the full, bright moon (because the night was clear) reached the part of the sky opposite my window and shone through the uncovered glass, its powerful light woke me up. Waking up in the middle of the night, I saw its perfectly clear, silvery disk. It was beautiful but unsettlingly serious. I sat up slightly and reached out my arm to close the curtain. Suddenly, I heard an absolutely horrifying scream! The peace and quiet of the night was violently broken by a wild, piercing shriek that echoed throughout Thornfield Hall. My heart stopped, my body froze; my extended arm couldn't move. The scream faded and wasn't repeated. Indeed, whatever creature made that terrifying sound couldn't possibly do it again quickly; not even the largest condor on the Andes could produce such a shout twice in a row from its nest hidden in the clouds. Whatever made that noise would need to rest before attempting it again. It came from the third floor, directly above me. And yes, from the room right above mine, I now heard what sounded like a desperate struggle and someone frantically shouting for help three times in quick succession. Then, while the sounds of stumbling and stomping continued chaotically through the floor and ceiling, I could make out the voice calling, \"Rochester! Rochester! For the love of God, come!\" A bedroom door opened, and someone ran or rushed along the corridor. Another set of footsteps pounded on the floor above, then something fell, and silence returned. Although fear made my limbs tremble, I managed to get dressed and leave my room. Everyone else was awake; startled exclamations and fearful whispers came from every room; doors opened one after another, and people peered out. The gallery filled with residents who had left their beds. Gentlemen and ladies alike were asking confusedly, \"Oh! What is it?\" \"Who's hurt?\" \"What's happened?\" \"Bring a light!\" \"Is it fire?\" \"Are there robbers?\" \"Where should we go?\" Without the moonlight, they would have been in total darkness. They ran back and forth, huddled together; some cried, some stumbled, the chaos was complete. \"Where in the world is Rochester?\" shouted Colonel Dent. \"He's not in his bed.\" \"Here! Here!\" came the reply. \"Everyone, calm down; I'm coming.\" And Mr. Rochester appeared at the end of the gallery with a candle, having just come down from the upper floor. One of the ladies immediately rushed to him and grabbed his arm; it was Miss Ingram. \"What dreadful event has occurred?\" she asked. \"Speak! Let us know the worst immediately!\" \"But don't pull me over or choke me,\" he replied, as the Misses Eshton were now also clinging to him, and the two older ladies, wrapped in large white dressing gowns, were approaching him like ships under full sail. \"Everything's fine! Everything's fine!\" he announced. \"It's just a practice run of a dramatic scene. Ladies, keep back, or I might get angry.\" He looked angry indeed, with sparks in his dark eyes. Making an effort to calm himself, he added, \"A servant had a nightmare; that's all. She's a sensitive, nervous person; she undoubtedly mistook her dream for a ghost or something similar and fainted from fright. Now, I need to see you all back into your rooms, because I can't attend to her until the house is settled. Gentlemen, please set an example for the ladies. Miss Ingram, I'm sure you will show yourself superior to pointless fears. Amy and Louisa, go back to your rooms like the little doves you are. Mesdames\" (to the older ladies), \"you will definitely catch a severe cold if you stay in this chilly corridor any longer.\" And so, by using a combination of gentle persuasion and firm commands, he successfully got them all back into their individual bedrooms.",

I found myself staring at the dazzling whiteness of the moon, which was lovely but struck me as rather grave. As I sat up and reached for the curtain, a piercing cry shattered the stillness and comfort of the night throughout Thornfield Hall. I was so terrified I felt frozen, unable to move, as the scream faded away. It was so intense, I doubted if any creature could make such a noise twice in a row; certainly, whoever had screamed needed time to recover. The sound had come from the third floor, passing above me. I then heard what sounded like a fierce struggle in the room overhead, followed by a muffled voice frantically yelling for help three times and then, desperately, calling, \"Rochester! For God’s sake, come!\" Suddenly a door above opened, hurried footsteps resounded, something heavy fell, and all went quiet.\n\nStill trembling with fear, I hastily put on some clothes and left my room. The other guests had also been woken: everywhere, doors opened and anxious people gathered in confusion, muttering, \"What has happened? Who is hurt? Is it a fire? Are there thieves?\" Amid the commotion, since there were no lights apart from the moon, everyone stumbled about in panic. Colonel Dent yelled, anxious because he couldn't find Mr. Rochester, to which a voice replied that he was coming. Mr. Rochester entered, holding a candle and having just come from upstairs. Miss Ingram hurried to his side, demanding to know what terrible event had happened, but he joked that if everyone clung to him, he’d be strangled or pulled down, for several ladies were surrounding him.\n\nTrying to calm the crowd, Rochester explained that it was just a servant with a nightmare, and that her fears had gotten the best of her. He told everyone to return to their rooms, assuring them there was no real danger. With gentle persuasion and firm instructions, he managed to shepherd everyone back to where they belonged."

I must watch this ghastly countenance—these blue, still lips forbidden to unclose—these eyes now shut, now opening, now wandering through the room, now fixing on me, and ever glazed with the dulness of horror. I must dip my hand again and again in the basin of blood and water, and wipe away the trickling gore. I must see the light of the unsnuffed candle wane on my employment; the shadows darken on the wrought, antique tapestry round me, and grow black under the hangings of the vast old bed, and quiver strangely over the doors of a great cabinet opposite—whose front, divided into twelve panels, bore, in grim design, the heads of the twelve apostles, each enclosed in its separate panel as in a frame; while above them at the top rose an ebon crucifix and a dying Christ.\nAccording as the shifting obscurity and flickering gleam hovered here or glanced there, it was now the bearded physician, Luke, that bent his brow; now St. John’s long hair that waved; and anon the devilish face of Judas, that grew out of the panel, and seemed gathering life and threatening a revelation of the arch-traitor—of Satan himself—in his subordinate’s form.\nAmidst all this, I had to listen as well as watch: to listen for the movements of the wild beast or the fiend in yonder side den. But since Mr. Rochester’s visit it seemed spellbound: all the night I heard but three sounds at three long intervals,—a step creak, a momentary renewal of the snarling, canine noise, and a deep human groan.\nThen my own thoughts worried me. What crime was this, that lived incarnate in this sequestered mansion, and could neither be expelled nor subdued by the owner?—what mystery, that broke out now in fire and now in blood, at the deadest hours of night? What creature was it, that, masked in an ordinary woman’s face and shape, uttered the voice, now of a mocking demon, and anon of a carrion-seeking bird of prey?\nAnd this man I bent over—this commonplace, quiet stranger—how had he become involved in the web of horror? and why had the Fury flown at him? What made him seek this quarter of the house at an untimely season, when he should have been asleep in bed? I had heard Mr. Rochester assign him an apartment below—what brought him here! And why, now, was he so tame under the violence or treachery done him? Why did he so quietly submit to the concealment Mr. Rochester enforced? Why did Mr. Rochester enforce this concealment? His guest had been outraged, his own life on a former occasion had been hideously plotted against; and both attempts he smothered in secrecy and sank in oblivion! Lastly, I saw Mr. Mason was submissive to Mr. Rochester; that the impetuous will of the latter held complete sway over the inertness of the former: the few words which had passed between them assured me of this. It was evident that in their former intercourse, the passive disposition of the one had been habitually influenced by the active energy of the other: whence then had arisen Mr. Rochester’s dismay when he heard of Mr. Mason’s arrival? Why had the mere name of this unresisting individual—whom his word now sufficed to control like a child—fallen on him, a few hours since, as a thunderbolt might fall on an oak?\nOh! I could not forget his look and his paleness when he whispered: “Jane, I have got a blow—I have got a blow, Jane.” I could not forget how the arm had trembled which he rested on my shoulder: and it was no light matter which could thus bow the resolute spirit and thrill the vigorous frame of Fairfax Rochester.\n“When will he come? When will he come?” I cried inwardly, as the night lingered and lingered—as my bleeding patient drooped, moaned, sickened: and neither day nor aid arrived. I had, again and again, held the water to Mason’s white lips; again and again offered him the stimulating salts: my efforts seemed ineffectual: either bodily or mental suffering, or loss of blood, or all three combined, were fast prostrating his strength. He moaned so, and looked so weak, wild, and lost, I feared he was dying; and I might not even speak to him.\nThe candle, wasted at last, went out; as it expired, I perceived streaks of grey light edging the window curtains: dawn was then approaching. Presently I heard Pilot bark far below, out of his distant kennel in the courtyard: hope revived. Nor was it unwarranted: in five minutes more the grating key, the yielding lock, warned me my watch was relieved. It could not have lasted more than two hours: many a week has seemed shorter.",
          "paraphrase_gemini-2.5-flash-preview-04-17": "I was located on the third floor, confined within one of its mysterious rooms. Night surrounded me. Before my eyes and hands lay a man, pale and bleeding, a terrible sight. A woman who had committed violence was close by, with only a single door separating us. This was truly frightening – I could endure the rest, but the mere idea of Grace Poole suddenly confronting me made me tremble. However, I knew I had to stay at my post. I had to watch this dreadful face – the still, blue lips that couldn't part, the eyes that sometimes closed, sometimes opened to look around the room, sometimes settled on me, always vacant with terror. I had to repeatedly put my hand into the basin of bloody water and clean away the dripping blood. I had to see the light of the untrimmed candle grow weaker as I performed my task, the shadows deepening on the old, patterned tapestry around me, turning black under the drapes of the huge old bed, and flickering oddly over the doors of a large cabinet opposite. This cabinet's front was divided into twelve sections, each bearing a grim representation of one of the twelve apostles' heads, framed within its panel. Above them, at the top, was a black crucifix with a dying Christ figure. Depending on where the shifting darkness and flickering light fell, sometimes the bearded face of Luke seemed to frown, sometimes St. John's long hair appeared to move, and sometimes the evil face of Judas seemed to emerge from the panel, as if coming to life and hinting at the ultimate betrayer – Satan himself, appearing in the form of his follower. Amidst all this, I had to listen as well as watch, straining to hear any movements of the violent creature or demon in the adjacent room. But since Mr. Rochester's visit, she seemed quiet, as if under a spell. All night, I heard only three sounds at long intervals: a floorboard creaking, a brief recurrence of that animalistic snarling, and a deep human groan. My own thoughts also troubled me. What kind of crime was this, residing physically within this secluded house, something the owner couldn't remove or control? What secret was this, manifesting violently now as fire, now as blood, in the deepest hours of the night? What sort of being was it, appearing as a normal woman, whose voice could sound like a mocking devil one moment and a scavenging bird the next? And this man I was attending to – this ordinary, calm visitor – how had he become entangled in this horrifying situation? Why had the violent woman attacked him? What reason brought him to this part of the house at such an unusual hour, when he should have been asleep in the room Mr. Rochester had given him downstairs? And why, now, was he so passive after the attack or betrayal he had suffered? Why did he so calmly accept the secrecy Mr. Rochester insisted upon? Why did Mr. Rochester demand this secrecy? His guest had been brutally assaulted, and Rochester's own life had been previously threatened in a dreadful plot; yet, he buried both incidents in secrecy and tried to make them forgotten! Lastly, I observed that Mr. Mason was submissive to Mr. Rochester; the latter's strong will completely controlled the former's passive nature. The few words they exchanged confirmed this. It was clear that in their past interactions, Mason's yielding disposition had always been influenced by Rochester's forceful energy. So, then, why had Mr. Rochester shown such alarm when he heard of Mr. Mason's arrival? Why had the mere name of this compliant person – whom Rochester could now command like a child – affected him, just hours ago, as if lightning had struck a tree? Oh! I couldn't forget his appearance and paleness when he whispered, “Jane, I've been hit—I've been hit, Jane.” I couldn't forget the tremor in the arm he rested on my shoulder. It must have been something serious to so affect the determined spirit and vigorous body of Fairfax Rochester. “When will he come? When will help arrive?” I thought desperately, as the night seemed endless, and my injured patient weakened, moaned, and grew sicker. Neither daylight nor assistance came. Again and again, I held water to Mason's pale lips; again and again, I offered him the stimulating salts. My efforts seemed useless. It appeared that physical pain, emotional distress, blood loss, or all three combined, were rapidly exhausting his strength. He moaned constantly and looked so weak, agitated, and lost that I feared he was dying, yet I was not permitted to speak to him. Finally, the candle burned down and went out. As it died, I saw faint lines of grey light along the window curtains, indicating dawn was approaching. Soon after, I heard Pilot barking far below from his kennel in the courtyard; hope returned. And it was well-founded. Within five more minutes, the sound of the key scraping and the lock turning told me my watch was over. It could not have lasted more than two hours, yet many a week has felt shorter than that period.",
          "paraphrase_gpt-4.1-2025-04-14": "I found myself on the third floor, locked inside one of its mysterious rooms. Night enveloped me; before my eyes and at my hands lay a grim and bloody scene, with a murderer separated from me only by a nearby door. That thought was terrifying—the rest I could handle—but the idea of Grace Poole suddenly attacking me filled me with dread. Still, I knew I had to stay at my post, keeping watch over the ghastly face before me—the motionless blue lips, forbidden to speak; the eyes that sometimes closed, sometimes opened and roamed the room, sometimes focused intently on me, always glazed with fear. My task was to repeatedly dip my hand into a basin of blood and water, cleaning the streaming blood, all while the candlelight faded over my work; shadows grew deeper on the intricate old tapestry and turned black around the large old bed, flickered strangely over a cabinet with twelve painted panels showing the apostles’ heads, each in its own panel, topped with a dark crucifix and a dying image of Christ. Depending on how the unsteady light played, I would see the faces change—sometimes the physician Luke, sometimes St. John's flowing hair, then suddenly Judas’s sinister face seemed to come alive from the wood, threatening to reveal evil itself hiding within his features. Amid all this, I had to listen for any sign of movement from the wild person or fiend locked away in the next room. Since Mr. Rochester’s earlier visit, though, it seemed subdued; all night I heard only three noises at long intervals: a footstep creaking, a brief low growl like an animal, and a deep pained groan. Meanwhile, disturbing thoughts filled my mind. What crime was embodied here in this isolated mansion—one the owner could neither drive out nor suppress? What mystery flared up at night in fire and blood? What creature, appearing as a normal woman, had the voice sometimes of a mocking demon, sometimes of a scavenger bird? And this quiet, ordinary-looking man I cared for—how did he get caught up in this horror? Why did this mad attack happen to him? Why was he even here in this part of the house at such an hour, instead of his assigned rooms below? And why did he submit so passively to Mr. Rochester’s order to keep everything secret? Why did Mr. Rochester insist on hiding these terrible incidents? He and his guest had both been victims—why did he bury it in silence? I could also tell Mr. Mason was deeply influenced by Mr. Rochester, who had complete power over him; their brief conversation had made that obvious. Their past relationship had always been this way—yet why was Mr. Rochester so shocked to hear of Mr. Mason’s arrival earlier? Why did just hearing his name seem to strike Rochester like a bolt of lightning? I couldn’t forget the look on his face when he confided to me, trembling and pale, that he’d been dealt a dreadful blow. It was serious, to move such a strong, determined spirit. As the night seemed to drag on endlessly, while my patient worsened and there was still no sign of help or daylight, I kept repeating to myself, 'When will he come? When will he come?' I offered water and smelling salts to Mason repeatedly, but nothing helped—he seemed to grow weaker and more delirious from pain, fear, or blood loss, and I worried he might die, yet I couldn’t even speak to him. The candle finally burned out, and as it died, I saw the first pale dawn at the window. Soon, Pilot the dog barked in the distant courtyard below, lifting my hopes—and rightly so, as within five minutes I heard the key turning and the lock opening, signaling my watch was finally over. The ordeal can’t have lasted more than two hours, but it felt far longer."

Mr. Rochester then pulled back the heavy curtain and drew up the blind, letting in as much daylight as possible; I was surprised and relieved to see how far dawn had progressed, with rosy streaks beginning to brighten the east. He then approached Mason, whom the surgeon was already attending to. \"Now, my good fellow, how are you?\" he asked. Mason replied weakly, \"I fear she has finished me.\" \"Not at all!\" Rochester countered. \"Courage! This day fortnight you'll hardly be any worse off; you've just lost a little blood, that's all.

This wound wasn't made with a knife; teeth have been involved here!\" \"She bit me,\" Mason murmured. \"She mauled me like a wild cat when Rochester took the knife from her.\" \"You should not have given up; you should have grappled with her immediately,\" said Mr. Rochester. \"But under such circumstances, what could one do?\" Mason replied. \"Oh, it was terrifying!\" he added, shuddering. \"And I didn't expect it; she looked so calm at first.\" \"I warned you,\" his friend replied. \"I said—be cautious when you go near her.

Rochester then addressed Mason, the injured man, who weakly commented that he feared he was badly hurt. Rochester dismissed his worries, assuring him that in two weeks he would be as well as ever and that he had only lost some blood. Carter also tried to reassure Mason, but noted with concern that the wound was torn as well as cut, indicating teeth marks rather than a knife wound. Mason confirmed that the woman bit him and attacked him like a wild animal when Rochester took the knife from her. Rochester admonished Mason for not defending himself, to which Mason replied he hadn't expected her to turn violent since she seemed calm at first. Rochester reminded him he had warned him to be careful and criticized him for not waiting until the next day when he could have accompanied him. Mason said he thought he could help. Rochester, losing patience, told him his suffering was punishment enough for not listening. Carter continued tending the wounds, noticing more bite marks, and Mason mentioned that the woman bit him in the arm as well, claiming she would drain his heart.

I approached him, and said the gentlemen were coming; he nodded: then I looked carefully round and listened. The stillness of early morning slumbered everywhere; the curtains were yet drawn over the servants’ chamber windows; little birds were just twittering in the blossom-blanched orchard trees, whose boughs drooped like white garlands over the wall enclosing one side of the yard; the carriage horses stamped from time to time in their closed stables: all else was still.\nThe gentlemen now appeared.

The side-passage door was secured; I opened it as quietly as possible. The entire yard was still, but the large gates were standing wide open, and a post-chaise, with the horses already harnessed and the driver seated on the box, was positioned just outside. I approached him and informed him the gentlemen were approaching; he nodded in response. I then looked around carefully and listened intently. The tranquility of early morning sleep pervaded everywhere; the curtains were still drawn over the windows of the servants' quarters; tiny birds were just starting to chirp in the orchard trees, which were white with blossoms, their branches drooping like pale garlands over the wall that enclosed one side of the yard. The carriage horses occasionally stamped their feet in their closed stables; everything else was motionless. The gentlemen soon appeared. Mason, supported by Mr. Rochester and the surgeon, seemed able to walk with reasonable ease. They helped him into the chaise; Carter entered afterward. \"Take care of him,\" Mr. Rochester instructed Carter, \"and keep him at your residence until he has fully recovered. I will ride over in a day or two to check on his condition. Richard, how are you doing?\" \"The fresh air is restoring me, Fairfax.\" \"Leave the window open on his side, Carter; there is no wind—farewell, Dick.\" \"Fairfax—\" \"Yes, what is it?\" \"Ensure she is looked after; see that she is treated as gently as can be; make sure she—\" He broke off, bursting into tears. \"I am doing my utmost; I have done it, and I will continue to do so,\" came the reply.

She was to return and signal if anyone was nearby. Jane found the house silent and the kitchen dark as dawn approached. She quietly opened the door and found the yard still and the coach waiting outside with its driver. She told him the gentlemen were on their way, and he acknowledged her. The atmosphere outside was peaceful, with the servants’ windows still curtained, birds beginning to sing in the orchard, and everything else calm. Soon, Mr. Rochester, Mr. Mason, and the surgeon appeared. They helped Mason into the carriage, and Carter joined him. Mr. Rochester instructed Carter to care for Mason at his home until he recovered and promised to visit in a few days. Mason, feeling revived by the fresh air, asked Rochester to ensure a woman—left unnamed—would also be treated gently, then became emotional and wept. Rochester assured him that he had always done his best for her and would continue to do so, shut the carriage door, and watched it depart. As he closed and secured the gates, Rochester wished that all the troubles were over."

          "text_segment": "This done, he moved with slow step and abstracted air towards a door in the wall bordering the orchard. I, supposing he had done with me, prepared to return to the house; again, however, I heard him call “Jane!” He had opened the portal and stood at it, waiting for me.\n“Come where there is some freshness, for a few moments,” he said; “that house is a mere dungeon: don’t you feel it so?”\n“It seems to me a splendid mansion, sir.”\n“The glamour of inexperience is over your eyes,” he answered; “and you see it through a charmed medium: you cannot discern that the gilding is slime and the silk draperies cobwebs; that the marble is sordid slate, and the polished woods mere refuse chips and scaly bark. Now here” (he pointed to the leafy enclosure we had entered) “all is real, sweet, and pure.”\nHe strayed down a walk edged with box, with apple trees, pear trees, and cherry trees on one side, and a border on the other full of all sorts of old-fashioned flowers, stocks, sweet-williams, primroses, pansies, mingled with southernwood, sweet-briar, and various fragrant herbs. They were fresh now as a succession of April showers and gleams, followed by a lovely spring morning, could make them: the sun was just entering the dappled east, and his light illumined the wreathed and dewy orchard trees and shone down the quiet walks under them.\n“Jane, will you have a flower?”\nHe gathered a half-blown rose, the first on the bush, and offered it to me.\n“Thank you, sir.”\n“Do you like this sunrise, Jane? That sky with its high and light clouds which are sure to melt away as the day waxes warm—this placid and balmly atmosphere?”\n“I do, very much.”\n“You have passed a strange night, Jane.”\n“Yes, sir.”\n“And it has made you look pale—were you afraid when I left you alone with Mason?”\n“I was afraid of some one coming out of the inner room.”\n“But I had fastened the door—I had the key in my pocket: I should have been a careless shepherd if I had left a lamb—my pet lamb—so near a wolf’s den, unguarded: you were safe.”\n“Will Grace Poole live here still, sir?”\n“Oh yes! don’t trouble your head about her—put the thing out of your thoughts.”\n“Yet it seems to me your life is hardly secure while she stays.”\n“Never fear—I will take care of myself.”\n“Is the danger you apprehended last night gone by now, sir?”\n“I cannot vouch for that till Mason is out of England: nor even then. To live, for me, Jane, is to stand on a crater-crust which may crack and spue fire any day.”\n“But Mr. Mason seems a man easily led. Your influence, sir, is evidently potent with him: he will never set you at defiance or wilfully injure you.”\n“Oh, no! Mason will not defy me; nor, knowing it, will he hurt me—but, unintentionally, he might in a moment, by one careless word, deprive me, if not of life, yet for ever of happiness.”\n“Tell him to be cautious, sir: let him know what you fear, and show him how to avert the danger.”\nHe laughed sardonically, hastily took my hand, and as hastily threw it from him.\n“If I could do that, simpleton, where would the danger be? Annihilated in a moment. Ever since I have known Mason, I have only had to say to him ‘Do that,’ and the thing has been done. But I cannot give him orders in this case: I cannot say ‘Beware of harming me, Richard;’ for it is imperative that I should keep him ignorant that harm to me is possible. Now you look puzzled; and I will puzzle you further. You are my little friend, are you not?”\n“I like to serve you, sir, and to obey you in all that is right.”\n“Precisely: I see you do. I see genuine contentment in your gait and mien, your eye and face, when you are helping me and pleasing me—working for me, and with me, in, as you characteristically say, ‘all that is right:’ for if I bid you do what you thought wrong, there would be no light-footed running, no neat-handed alacrity, no lively glance and animated complexion. My friend would then turn to me, quiet and pale, and would say, ‘No, sir; that is impossible: I cannot do it, because it is wrong;’ and would become immutable as a fixed star. Well, you too have power over me, and may injure me: yet I dare not show you where I am vulnerable, lest, faithful and friendly as you are, you should transfix me at once.”\n“If you have no more to fear from Mr. Mason than you have from me, sir, you are very safe.”\n“God grant it may be so! Here, Jane, is an arbour; sit down.”\nThe arbour was an arch in the wall, lined with ivy; it contained a rustic seat. Mr. Rochester took it, leaving room, however, for me: but I stood before him.\n“Sit,” he said; “the bench is long enough for two. You don’t hesitate to take a place at my side, do you? Is that wrong, Jane?”\nI answered him by assuming it: to refuse would, I felt, have been unwise.\n“Now, my little friend, while the sun drinks the dew—while all the flowers in this old garden awake and expand, and the birds fetch their young ones’ breakfast out of the Thornfield, and the early bees do their first spell of work—I’ll put a case to you, which you must endeavour to suppose your own: but first, look at me, and tell me you are at ease, and not fearing that I err in detaining you, or that you err in staying.”\n“No, sir; I am content.”\n“Well then, Jane, call to aid your fancy:—suppose you were no longer a girl well reared and disciplined, but a wild boy indulged from childhood upwards; imagine yourself in a remote foreign land; conceive that you there commit a capital error, no matter of what nature or from what motives, but one whose consequences must follow you through life and taint all your existence. Mind, I don’t say a crime; I am not speaking of shedding of blood or any other guilty act, which might make the perpetrator amenable to the law: my word is error. The results of what you have done become in time to you utterly insupportable; you take measures to obtain relief: unusual measures, but neither unlawful nor culpable. Still you are miserable; for hope has quitted you on the very confines of life: your sun at noon darkens in an eclipse, which you feel will not leave it till the time of setting. Bitter and base associations have become the sole food of your memory: you wander here and there, seeking rest in exile: happiness in pleasure—I mean in heartless, sensual pleasure—such as dulls intellect and blights feeling. Heart-weary and soul-withered, you come home after years of voluntary banishment: you make a new acquaintance—how or where no matter: you find in this stranger much of the good and bright qualities which you have sought for twenty years, and never before encountered; and they are all fresh, healthy, without soil and without taint. Such society revives, regenerates: you feel better days come back—higher wishes, purer feelings; you desire to recommence your life, and to spend what remains to you of days in a way more worthy of an immortal being. To attain this end, are you justified in overleaping an obstacle of custom—a mere conventional impediment which neither your conscience sanctifies nor your judgment approves?”\nHe paused for an answer: and what was I to say? Oh, for some good spirit to suggest a judicious and satisfactory response! Vain aspiration! The west wind whispered in the ivy round me; but no gentle Ariel borrowed its breath as a medium of speech: the birds sang in the tree-tops; but their song, however sweet, was inarticulate.\nAgain Mr. Rochester propounded his query:\n“Is the wandering and sinful, but now rest-seeking and repentant, man justified in daring the world’s opinion, in order to attach to him for ever this gentle, gracious, genial stranger, thereby securing his own peace of mind and regeneration of life?”",

I thought he was finished with me and prepared to go back to the house. However, I heard him call my name, \"Jane!\" He had opened the gate and was waiting for me there.\n\n\"Come somewhere fresh for a little while,\" he said. \"That house is nothing more than a prison. Don't you feel that way?\"\n\n\"It seems like a magnificent manor to me, sir.\"\n\n\"Inexperience blinds you,\" he replied. \"You're seeing it through a magical filter. You can't tell that the so-called gold is actually grime, the silk curtains are cobwebs, the marble is just cheap slate, and the polished wood is merely scrap chips and rough bark. But here,\" he indicated the leafy area we had entered, \"everything is genuine, pleasant, and unspoiled.\"\n\nHe walked down a path lined with boxwood hedges, with apple, pear, and cherry trees on one side and a border on the other filled with traditional flowers like stocks, sweet-williams, primroses, pansies, mixed with southernwood, sweet-briar, and various aromatic herbs. They were as vibrant as a sequence of April showers and sunshine followed by a lovely spring morning could make them. The sun was just appearing in the colourful east, its light illuminating the twisting, dewy orchard trees and shining down the quiet paths beneath them.\n\n\"Jane, would you like a flower?\"\n\nHe picked a half-open rose, the first on the bush, and offered it to me.\n\n\"Thank you, sir.\"\n\n\"Do you like this sunrise, Jane? The sky with its high, light clouds that are bound to disappear as the day gets warmer—this calm and soothing air?\"\n\n\"I do, very much.\"\n\n\"You had an unusual night, Jane.\"\n\n\"Yes, sir.\"\n\n\"And it made you look pale. Were you scared when I left you alone with Mason?\"\n\n\"I was afraid someone might come out of the inner room.\"\n\n\"But I had locked the door. I had the key in my pocket. I would have been a negligent shepherd if I had left a lamb—my special lamb—so close to a wolf's den, unprotected. You were safe.\"\n\n\"Will Grace Poole continue to live here, sir?\"\n\n\"Oh, yes! Don't worry yourself about her. Put the matter out of your mind.\"\n\n\"Still, it seems to me your life is barely safe while she remains.\"\n\n\"Don't worry—I will look after myself.\"\n\n\"Is the danger you anticipated last night over now, sir?\"\n\n\"I can't guarantee that until Mason is out of England, and perhaps not even then. For me, Jane, living is like standing on a volcanic crust that could crack and erupt fire at any moment.\"\n\n\"But Mr. Mason seems easily influenced. Your power over him is clearly strong, sir. He would never defy you or intentionally harm you.\"\n\n\"Oh, no! Mason won't challenge me; nor, knowing the consequence, would he harm me. But unintentionally, he might, in an instant, with a single careless word, deprive me, if not of life, then forever of happiness.\"\n\n\"Tell him to be careful, sir. Let him know what you fear, and show him how to avoid the danger.\"\n\nHe laughed cynically, quickly took my hand, and just as quickly dropped it.\n\n\"If I could do that, you simple girl, where would the danger be? Instantly gone. Ever since I've known Mason, all I've had to say is, 'Do that,' and it's done. But I cannot give him orders in this situation. I cannot say, 'Be careful about harming me, Richard,' because it is crucial that I keep him unaware that he can cause me harm. Now you look puzzled, and I'll puzzle you further. You are my little friend, aren't you?\"\n\n\"I enjoy serving you, sir, and obeying you in all that is right.\"\n\n\"Precisely; I see that you do. I see genuine happiness in your manner, your eyes, and your face when you are assisting and pleasing me—working for and with me, in what you characteristically call 'all that is right.' Because if I asked you to do something you thought was wrong, there would be no light-footed movement, no quick, skilled help, no lively gaze or animated face. My friend would then turn to me, quiet and pale, and say, 'No, sir; that is impossible. I cannot do it, because it is wrong,' and would become as unmoving as a star. Well, you too have influence over me and could injure me. Yet I dare not reveal where I am vulnerable, for fear that, loyal and friendly as you are, you might wound me immediately.\"\n\n\"If you have no more to fear from Mr. Mason than you do from me, sir, you are very secure.\"\n\n\"God grant that is true! Here, Jane, is an arbour; sit down.\"\n\nThe arbour was an archway in the wall covered in ivy. It contained a rustic bench. Mr. Rochester sat on it, leaving space for me, but I remained standing before him.\n\n\"Sit,\" he said. \"The bench is long enough for two. You don't hesitate to take a seat beside me, do you? Is that wrong, Jane?\"\n\nI replied by sitting down; I felt refusing would have been unwise.\n\n\"Now, my little friend, while the sun absorbs the dew—while all the flowers in this old garden awaken and open, and the birds bring breakfast to their young from Thornfield, and the early bees do their first tasks—I will present you with a hypothetical situation, which you must try to imagine is happening to you. But first, look at me and tell me you are comfortable and not worried that I am wrong to keep you, or that you are wrong to stay.\"\n\n\"No, sir; I am content.\"\n\n\"Very well then, Jane, use your imagination. Suppose you were no longer a well-raised and disciplined girl, but a wild boy spoiled from childhood. Picture yourself in a distant foreign land. Imagine that you commit a major mistake there—the nature or reasons don't matter—but one whose consequences will follow you throughout your life and spoil your entire existence. Note, I am not saying a crime; I am not talking about shedding blood or any other guilty act that could make the perpetrator subject to the law. My word is error. Over time, the results of your action become completely unbearable. You take steps to find relief—unconventional steps, but neither illegal nor blameworthy. Still, you are unhappy, for hope has abandoned you just as you reach the threshold of life. Your sun at noon is darkened by an eclipse that you feel will not end until sunset. Bitter and unpleasant memories have become the only sustenance for your mind. You wander from place to place, seeking rest in exile and happiness in pleasure—by which I mean heartless, physical pleasure—the kind that dulls the mind and withers feelings. Weary in heart and soul, you return home after years of self-imposed exile. You meet a new acquaintance—how or where doesn't matter. You find in this stranger many of the good and shining qualities you have searched for for twenty years and never before encountered. And they are all fresh, healthy, pure, and unspoiled. Such companionship revives and renews you. You feel better days returning—higher desires, purer emotions. You want to start your life over and spend the remainder of your days in a way more fitting for an immortal being. To achieve this aim, are you justified in disregarding a social obstacle—a purely conventional barrier that your conscience doesn't approve of, nor your judgment sanction?\"\n\nHe paused for an answer, and what could I say? Oh, for some helpful spirit to suggest a sensible and satisfying reply! A futile wish! The west wind whispered in the ivy around me, but no gentle spirit borrowed its breath to speak. The birds sang in the treetops, but their song, however sweet, was unclear.\n\nMr. Rochester repeated his question:\n\n\"Is the man who has strayed and sinned, but who now seeks peace and repents, justified in defying the world's opinion in order to bind to himself forever this gentle, kind, cheerful stranger, thereby securing his own peace of mind and a renewed life?\"",

Thinking our conversation was over, I began to head back to the house, but then he called out, “Jane!” He’d opened the door and was standing there, waiting for me. \n\n“Step out here for a while, where it’s fresh,” he invited. “That house feels like a prison—don’t you agree?”\n\n“I think it’s a magnificent mansion, sir,” I replied.\n\n“You’re still inexperienced,” he said. “You view it through the eyes of youth—it appears enchanting. What you see as luxury is just an illusion: gold that’s really slime, fine fabrics that are actually cobwebs, marble that is just plain slate, polished wood that’s nothing but scraps and bark. Out here,” he indicated the lush orchard we entered, “everything is genuine, sweet, and pure.”\n\nWe strolled down a path lined with box hedges, apple, pear, and cherry trees on one side, and on the other, a border filled with traditional flowers—stocks, sweet-williams, primroses, pansies—mixed with fragrant herbs like southernwood and sweet-briar. Thanks to recent rains and a beautiful morning, everything was fresh. The sun rose in a mottled sky, lighting up the dewy orchard trees and serene pathways beneath them.\n\n“Jane, would you like a flower?” he asked, picking the first rosebud from a bush and handing it to me.\n\n“Thank you, sir.”\n\n“Do you like this sunrise, Jane? The sky with its high, wispy clouds that will disappear as it gets warmer—the calm, pleasant air?”\n\n“I do, very much.”\n\n“You had an unusual night, Jane.”\n\n“Yes, sir.”\n\n“You look pale—were you afraid when I left you alone with Mason?”\n\n“I feared someone might come out of the inner room.”\n\n“But the door was locked, and I had the key.

Don’t worry about her—just put her from your mind.”\n\n“But surely your safety isn’t guaranteed with her here.”\n\n“I’ll look after myself—don’t worry.”\n\n“Has the danger you were worried about last night passed?”\n\n“I can’t be completely sure until Mason leaves England, maybe not even then. Living, for me, is like standing on a volcano that could erupt at any time.”\n\n“But Mr. Mason seems easy to manage; you clearly have influence over him. He’d never defy or purposely harm you.”\n\n“That’s true. Mason won’t defy or intentionally hurt me, but he might accidentally cause me to lose not my life, but my happiness. Just one careless word…\"\n\n“Warn him, sir; let him know the danger so he can avoid it.”\n\nHe laughed bitterly, quickly grabbed my hand, then let it go. \"If only it were that simple! Ever since knowing Mason, all I’ve needed to do is say, ‘do that,’ and he would. But with this, I can’t command him. I can’t warn him not to harm me, because he mustn’t know I’m vulnerable. You look puzzled—let me confound you more. You’re my little friend, aren’t you?”\n\n“I’m happy to help and obey you in all things right, sir.”\n\n“Yes, you are. I see how content you are when you do so—if I asked you to do wrong, though, you’d refuse. Then you’d be quiet, pale, and unchanging, insisting, ‘No, sir, I can’t—it’s wrong.’ Even you could harm me, so I can’t show where I’m vulnerable, lest you strike—even if you are faithful.”\n\n“If you’re as safe from Mason as from me, sir, then you’ve nothing to fear.”\n\n“Let’s hope so! Here, Jane, is an arbour; sit down.”\n\nThe arbour was an ivy-covered alcove in the wall, with a rustic bench. Mr. Rochester sat, leaving room for me, but I hesitated.\n\n“Sit,” he urged. “The bench is big enough for both. You don’t mind sitting beside me, do you? Is that improper, Jane?”\n\nI sat beside him, realizing to refuse would be unwise.\n\n“Now, while the sun dries the dew, the flowers open, and the birds and bees are about their business, let’s imagine a situation. But first, are you comfortable with me, Jane—you don’t fear you’re doing wrong by staying?”\n\n“No, sir, I’m content.”\n\n“All right. Imagine you’re not a well-raised, disciplined girl, but a spoiled boy, allowed every indulgence since childhood. Picture yourself in a distant land where you make a serious mistake—not a crime, not bloodshed or anything against the law, but a grave error with life-long consequences. In time, this error becomes unbearable, so you take unusual steps to find relief—not illegal or immoral, but still you are unhappy; hope deserts you, your life is eclipsed. Your memories are bitter; you wander in exile seeking peace in fleeting pleasures. You return home after years away and meet someone new—someone who finally has all the good qualities you’ve searched for. Their presence renews you, gives you hope and better feelings. You long to start over and live more worthily. To do that, would you be right to bypass a mere social barrier—a custom your conscience and reason don’t approve—in order to secure your happiness?”\n\nHe paused. I didn’t know what to say; I wished for advice, but only the wind and birds answered, in meaningless whispers and songs.\n\nMr. Rochester asked again: “Is the wandering, sinful man—now penitent and seeking rest—justified in defying society’s opinion, if it means joining himself forever to this gentle, virtuous person, and thus regaining peace and a new life?”"

          "text_segment": "Presentiments are strange things! and so are sympathies; and so are signs; and the three combined make one mystery to which humanity has not yet found the key. I never laughed at presentiments in my life, because I have had strange ones of my own. Sympathies, I believe, exist (for instance, between far-distant, long-absent, wholly estranged relatives asserting, notwithstanding their alienation, the unity of the source to which each traces his origin) whose workings baffle mortal comprehension. And signs, for aught we know, may be but the sympathies of Nature with man.\nWhen I was a little girl, only six years old, I one night heard Bessie Leaven say to Martha Abbot that she had been dreaming about a little child; and that to dream of children was a sure sign of trouble, either to one’s self or one’s kin. The saying might have worn out of my memory, had not a circumstance immediately followed which served indelibly to fix it there. The next day Bessie was sent for home to the deathbed of her little sister.\nOf late I had often recalled this saying and this incident; for during the past week scarcely a night had gone over my couch that had not brought with it a dream of an infant, which I sometimes hushed in my arms, sometimes dandled on my knee, sometimes watched playing with daisies on a lawn, or again, dabbling its hands in running water. It was a wailing child this night, and a laughing one the next: now it nestled close to me, and now it ran from me; but whatever mood the apparition evinced, whatever aspect it wore, it failed not for seven successive nights to meet me the moment I entered the land of slumber.\nI did not like this iteration of one idea—this strange recurrence of one image, and I grew nervous as bedtime approached and the hour of the vision drew near. It was from companionship with this baby-phantom I had been roused on that moonlight night when I heard the cry; and it was on the afternoon of the day following I was summoned downstairs by a message that some one wanted me in Mrs. Fairfax’s room. On repairing thither, I found a man waiting for me, having the appearance of a gentleman’s servant: he was dressed in deep mourning, and the hat he held in his hand was surrounded with a crape band.",
          "paraphrase_gemini-2.5-flash-preview-04-17": "Premonitions, deep connections between individuals (sympathies), and omens (signs) are all strange phenomena. Together, they form a mystery that humanity hasn't yet solved. I've always taken premonitions seriously because I've experienced unusual ones myself. I believe sympathies exist, such as between distant relatives who are completely estranged but still connected by their shared ancestry in ways we can't fully grasp. Perhaps signs are simply nature's way of empathizing with humans. When I was just six years old, I remember hearing Bessie Leaven tell Martha Abbot that dreaming of a child was a definite predictor of trouble for the dreamer or their family. That comment might have faded from my memory if an event hadn't immediately occurred that permanently embedded it there. The very next day, Bessie was called home because her younger sister was dying. Recently, I've often recalled this saying and incident, especially since the past week brought nightly dreams of an infant. In these dreams, I would sometimes cradle the baby, sometimes bounce it on my knee, watch it playing with flowers on the grass, or splashing in water. One night the child cried, the next it laughed; sometimes it cuddled close, other times it ran away. But regardless of the apparition's mood or appearance, it appeared to me for seven consecutive nights as soon as I entered sleep. This constant repetition of the same idea, this strange reappearance of one image, bothered me, making me anxious as bedtime and the hour of the vision approached. It was this dream-baby companion I was awakened from on the moonlit night when I heard the cry. The following afternoon, I was called downstairs because someone wanted to see me in Mrs. Fairfax's room. Upon arriving, I found a man waiting, who seemed to be a gentleman's servant. He was dressed entirely in black, and the hat he held had a mourning band around it.",

I have never ridiculed premonitions because I’ve experienced odd ones myself. I’m convinced that sympathies truly exist—such as those between distant and estranged relatives, who, despite their separation, still demonstrate a deep connection through their common origin. These sympathetic bonds often elude human understanding. Signs might simply be ways that Nature shows its sympathy for humanity. When I was a young girl of six, I overheard Bessie Leaven tell Martha Abbot she dreamt about a child, saying that such a dream was a sure omen of trouble, either for oneself or one’s family. Normally, I might have forgotten this comment, if not for the shocking event that immediately followed: Bessie was called home the next day to be with her dying little sister. Recently, I kept remembering that statement and what happened afterwards, because nearly every night that past week, I had dreamed of an infant—sometimes soothing it, sometimes playing with it, sometimes watching it among flowers, or seeing it by the water. On some nights it cried, on others it laughed; sometimes it clung to me, sometimes it tried to get away, but for seven nights straight, as soon as I fell asleep, this vision appeared. I became uneasy with this repeated dream and grew anxious as nighttime approached. It was from such a dream that I awoke on a moonlit night when I heard a cry—then, the next day, I was called to Mrs. Fairfax’s room. There, I met a man who looked like a gentleman’s servant, dressed in mourning, holding a hat with a black band around it."

He could not do worse: he ruined his health and his estate amongst the worst men and the worst women. He got into debt and into jail: his mother helped him out twice, but as soon as he was free he returned to his old companions and habits. His head was not strong: the knaves he lived amongst fooled him beyond anything I ever heard. He came down to Gateshead about three weeks ago and wanted missis to give up all to him. Missis refused: her means have long been much reduced by his extravagance; so he went back again, and the next news was that he was dead. How he died, God knows!—they say he killed himself.”\nI was silent: the tidings were frightful. Robert Leaven resumed—\n“Missis had been out of health herself for some time: she had got very stout, but was not strong with it; and the loss of money and fear of poverty were quite breaking her down. The information about Mr. John’s death and the manner of it came too suddenly: it brought on a stroke. She was three days without speaking; but last Tuesday she seemed rather better: she appeared as if she wanted to say something, and kept making signs to my wife and mumbling. It was only yesterday morning, however, that Bessie understood she was pronouncing your name; and at last she made out the words, ‘Bring Jane—fetch Jane Eyre: I want to speak to her.’ Bessie is not sure whether she is in her right mind, or means anything by the words; but she told Miss Reed and Miss Georgiana, and advised them to send for you. The young ladies put it off at first; but their mother grew so restless, and said, ‘Jane, Jane,’ so many times, that at last they consented. I left Gateshead yesterday: and if you can get ready, Miss, I should like to take you back with me early to-morrow morning.”",

I remember you clearly; you sometimes let me ride Miss Georgiana's brown pony. How is Bessie? Did you marry Bessie?\" \"Yes, Miss. My wife is doing very well, thank you. She had another baby about two months ago, bringing our total to three. Both the mother and the new baby are healthy.\" \"And how is the family at the manor, Robert?\" \"I'm afraid I don't have good news about them, Miss. They are in a very difficult situation right now—facing significant trouble.\" Looking at his dark clothes, I said, \"I hope no one has passed away.\" He also glanced at the black band on his hat and responded, \"Mr. John passed away a week ago yesterday at his place in London.\" \"Mr. John?\" \"Yes.\" \"And how is his mother coping?\" \"Well, Miss Eyre, you see, this isn't a simple misfortune. He led a very reckless life, especially over the past three years when he got involved in bad habits. His death was quite tragic.\" \"Bessie mentioned he wasn't doing well.\" \"Doing well? He couldn't have been doing worse! He destroyed his health and finances associating with terrible people. He ended up in debt and prison. His mother bailed him out twice, but he immediately went back to his former friends and activities. He wasn't mentally strong, and the dishonest people he associated with completely took advantage of him. About three weeks ago, he came to Gateshead demanding everything from Mrs. Reed. She refused because his wasteful spending had significantly decreased her own funds for a long time. So, he left, and the next thing we heard was that he had died. How he died is a mystery, though the rumour is he committed suicide.\" I remained silent, finding the news horrifying. Robert Leaven continued— \"Mrs. Reed herself hadn't been well for a while. She had gained a lot of weight but wasn't healthy, and her financial losses and fear of being poor were severely affecting her. Hearing about Mr. John's death and how it happened so suddenly caused her to have a stroke. She couldn't speak for three days, but last Tuesday, she seemed a bit better. She looked like she wanted to communicate something, making gestures towards my wife and muttering. However, it wasn't until yesterday morning that Bessie realised she was saying your name. Eventually, she managed to understand the words: 'Bring Jane—fetch Jane Eyre: I need to talk to her.' Bessie isn't certain if she's fully coherent or if the words have much meaning, but she told Miss Reed and Miss Georgiana and suggested they send for you. The young ladies initially delayed doing so, but their mother became so agitated and kept repeating 'Jane, Jane' so often that they finally agreed. I came from Gateshead yesterday, and if you are able to prepare, Miss, I would be happy to take you back with me first thing tomorrow morning.\"",

He ruined his health and wasted his inheritance with bad company. He ended up in debt and even jail; his mother bailed him out twice. As soon as he was free, he went back to his old habits. He wasn’t mentally strong, and the people around him took advantage of him. About three weeks ago, he came to Gateshead and demanded that his mother hand over everything to him. She refused, especially as her finances were already drained by his behavior. He left, and soon after came the news that he had died. Apparently, he took his own life.”\n\nI was shocked by these tragic events, and Robert continued: “Mrs. Reed herself has been in poor health; she had gained weight but not strength. The stress of money troubles and fear of poverty were wearing her down. Learning about Mr. John's death and how it happened was too much and brought on a stroke. She couldn't speak for three days; but by Tuesday, she seemed a little better and kept trying to say something, gesturing to my wife and mumbling. Yesterday, Bessie realized she was trying to say your name. Eventually Bessie understood her saying, ‘Bring Jane—fetch Jane Eyre: I want to speak to her.’ Bessie is not sure if she is fully aware or truly means it, but she told Miss Reed and Miss Georgiana and suggested you be sent for. At first, the young ladies delayed, but their mother became so uneasy and repeated your name so many times that they ended up agreeing. I left Gateshead yesterday, Miss, and if you can be ready, I’d like to take you back with me early tomorrow morning.”"

Bessie said she was sure you would not refuse: but I suppose you will have to ask leave before you can get off?”\n“Yes; and I will do it now;” and having directed him to the servants’ hall, and recommended him to the care of John’s wife, and the attentions of John himself, I went in search of Mr. Rochester.\nHe was not in any of the lower rooms; he was not in the yard, the stables, or the grounds. I asked Mrs. Fairfax if she had seen him;—yes: she believed he was playing billiards with Miss Ingram. To the billiard-room I hastened: the click of balls and the hum of voices resounded thence; Mr. Rochester, Miss Ingram, the two Misses Eshton, and their admirers, were all busied in the game. It required some courage to disturb so interesting a party; my errand, however, was one I could not defer, so I approached the master where he stood at Miss Ingram’s side. She turned as I drew near, and looked at me haughtily: her eyes seemed to demand, “What can the creeping creature want now?” and when I said, in a low voice, “Mr. Rochester,” she made a movement as if tempted to order me away. I remember her appearance at the moment—it was very graceful and very striking: she wore a morning robe of sky-blue crape; a gauzy azure scarf was twisted in her hair. She had been all animation with the game, and irritated pride did not lower the expression of her haughty lineaments.\n“Does that person want you?” she inquired of Mr. Rochester; and Mr. Rochester turned to see who the “person” was. He made a curious grimace—one of his strange and equivocal demonstrations—threw down his cue and followed me from the room.\n“Well, Jane?” he said, as he rested his back against the schoolroom door, which he had shut.\n“If you please, sir, I want leave of absence for a week or two.”\n“What to do?—where to go?”\n“To see a sick lady who has sent for me.”\n“What sick lady?—where does she live?”\n“At Gateshead; in ——shire.”\n“-shire? That is a hundred miles off! Who may she be that sends for people to see her that distance?”\n“Her name is Reed, sir—Mrs. Reed.”\n“Reed of Gateshead? There was a Reed of Gateshead, a magistrate.”\n“It is his widow, sir.”\n“And what have you to do with her? How do you know her?”\n“Mr. Reed was my uncle—my mother’s brother.”\n“The deuce he was! You never told me that before: you always said you had no relations.”\n“None that would own me, sir. Mr. Reed is dead, and his wife cast me off.”\n“Why?”\n“Because I was poor, and burdensome, and she disliked me.”\n“But Reed left children?—you must have cousins? Sir George Lynn was talking of a Reed of Gateshead yesterday, who, he said, was one of the veriest rascals on town; and Ingram was mentioning a Georgiana Reed of the same place, who was much admired for her beauty a season or two ago in London.”\n“John Reed is dead, too, sir: he ruined himself and half-ruined his family, and is supposed to have committed suicide. The news so shocked his mother that it brought on an apoplectic attack.”\n“And what good can you do her? Nonsense, Jane! I would never think of running a hundred miles to see an old lady who will, perhaps, be dead before you reach her: besides, you say she cast you off.”\n“Yes, sir, but that is long ago; and when her circumstances were very different: I could not be easy to neglect her wishes now.”\n“How long will you stay?”\n“As short a time as possible, sir.”\n“Promise me only to stay a week—”\n“I had better not pass my word: I might be obliged to break it.”\n“At all events you will come back: you will not be induced under any pretext to take up a permanent residence with her?”\n“Oh, no! I shall certainly return if all be well.”\n“And who goes with you? You don’t travel a hundred miles alone.”\n“No, sir, she has sent her coachman.”\n“A person to be trusted?”\n“Yes, sir, he has lived ten years in the family.”\nMr. Rochester meditated. “When do you wish to go?”\n“Early to-morrow morning, sir.”\n“Well, you must have some money; you can’t travel without money, and I daresay you have not much: I have given you no salary yet. How much have you in the world, Jane?” he asked, smiling.\nI drew out my purse; a meagre thing it was. “Five shillings, sir.” He took the purse, poured the hoard into his palm, and chuckled over it as if its scantiness amused him. Soon he produced his pocket-book: “Here,” said he, offering me a note; it was fifty pounds, and he owed me but fifteen. I told him I had no change.\n“I don’t want change; you know that. Take your wages.”\nI declined accepting more than was my due. He scowled at first; then, as if recollecting something, he said—\n“Right, right! Better not give you all now: you would, perhaps, stay away three months if you had fifty pounds. There are ten; is it not plenty?”\n“Yes, sir, but now you owe me five.”\n“Come back for it, then; I am your banker for forty pounds.”\n“Mr. Rochester, I may as well mention another matter of business to you while I have the opportunity.”\n“Matter of business? I am curious to hear it.”\n“You have as good as informed me, sir, that you are going shortly to be married?”\n“Yes; what then?”\n“In that case, sir, Adèle ought to go to school: I am sure you will perceive the necessity of it.”\n“To get her out of my bride’s way, who might otherwise walk over her rather too emphatically? There’s sense in the suggestion; not a doubt of it. Adèle, as you say, must go to school; and you, of course, must march straight to—the devil?”\n“I hope not, sir; but I must seek another situation somewhere.”\n“In course!” he exclaimed, with a twang of voice and a distortion of features equally fantastic and ludicrous. He looked at me some minutes.\n“And old Madam Reed, or the Misses, her daughters, will be solicited by you to seek a place, I suppose?”\n“No, sir; I am not on such terms with my relatives as would justify me in asking favours of them—but I shall advertise.”\n“You shall walk up the pyramids of Egypt!” he growled. “At your peril you advertise! I wish I had only offered you a sovereign instead of ten pounds. Give me back nine pounds, Jane; I’ve a use for it.”\n“And so have I, sir,” I returned, putting my hands and my purse behind me. “I could not spare the money on any account.”\n“Little niggard!” said he, “refusing me a pecuniary request! Give me five pounds, Jane.”\n“Not five shillings, sir; nor five pence.”\n“Just let me look at the cash.”\n“No, sir; you are not to be trusted.”\n“Jane!”\n“Sir?”\n“Promise me one thing.”\n“I’ll promise you anything, sir, that I think I am likely to perform.”\n“Not to advertise: and to trust this quest of a situation to me. I’ll find you one in time.”\n“I shall be glad so to do, sir, if you, in your turn, will promise that I and Adèle shall be both safe out of the house before your bride enters it.”\n“Very well! very well! I’ll pledge my word on it. You go to-morrow, then?”\n“Yes, sir; early.”\n“Shall you come down to the drawing-room after dinner?”\n“No, sir, I must prepare for the journey.”\n“Then you and I must bid good-bye for a little while?”\n“I suppose so, sir.”\n“And how do people perform that ceremony of parting, Jane? Teach me; I’m not quite up to it.”\n“They say, Farewell, or any other form they prefer.”\n“Then say it.”\n“Farewell, Mr. Rochester, for the present.”\n“What must I say?”\n“The same, if you like, sir.”\n“Farewell, Miss Eyre, for the present; is that all?”\n“Yes.”\n“It seems stingy, to my notions, and dry, and unfriendly. I should like something else: a little addition to the rite. If one shook hands, for instance; but no—that would not content me either. So you’ll do no more than say Farewell, Jane?”\n“It is enough, sir: as much good-will may be conveyed in one hearty word as in many.”\n“Very likely; but it is blank and cool—‘Farewell.’”\n“How long is he going to stand with his back against that door?” I asked myself; “I want to commence my packing.” The dinner-bell rang, and suddenly away he bolted, without another syllable: I saw him no more during the day, and was off before he had risen in the morning.",

Mrs. Fairfax thought he was playing billiards with Miss Ingram, so I hurried to the billiard room, where I heard the noise of balls and voices. There were Mr. Rochester, Miss Ingram, the Eshton sisters, and their company, all engrossed in the game. Nervously, I approached, knowing it would be intrusive but unable to put it off. When I drew near Mr. Rochester, Miss Ingram looked at me haughtily, as if to ask, \"What does this person want now?\" When I quietly called, \"Mr. Rochester,\" she moved as though she might send me away.

Sensible. Adèle must indeed go to school. And you’ll need to find another position?\"\n\n\"Yes, sir; I’ll advertise when the time comes, but I won’t ask my relatives.\"\n\n\"Don’t you dare advertise! I should have given you less money. Give back nine pounds.\"\n\n\"I also need it, sir, and can’t spare it.\" \n\n\"Stingy girl!

It was very clean and neat: the ornamental windows were hung with little white curtains; the floor was spotless; the grate and fire-irons were burnished bright, and the fire burnt clear. Bessie sat on the hearth, nursing her last-born, and Robert and his sister played quietly in a corner.\n“Bless you!—I knew you would come!” exclaimed Mrs. Leaven, as I entered.\n“Yes, Bessie,” said I, after I had kissed her; “and I trust I am not too late. How is Mrs. Reed?—Alive still, I hope.”\n“Yes, she is alive; and more sensible and collected than she was. The doctor says she may linger a week or two yet; but he hardly thinks she will finally recover.”\n“Has she mentioned me lately?”\n“She was talking of you only this morning, and wishing you would come, but she is sleeping now, or was ten minutes ago, when I was up at the house. She generally lies in a kind of lethargy all the afternoon, and wakes up about six or seven. Will you rest yourself here an hour, Miss, and then I will go up with you?”\nRobert here entered, and Bessie laid her sleeping child in the cradle and went to welcome him: afterwards she insisted on my taking off my bonnet and having some tea; for she said I looked pale and tired. I was glad to accept her hospitality; and I submitted to be relieved of my travelling garb just as passively as I used to let her undress me when a child.\nOld times crowded fast back on me as I watched her bustling about—setting out the tea-tray with her best china, cutting bread and butter, toasting a tea-cake, and, between whiles, giving little Robert or Jane an occasional tap or push, just as she used to give me in former days. Bessie had retained her quick temper as well as her light foot and good looks.\nTea ready, I was going to approach the table; but she desired me to sit still, quite in her old peremptory tones. I must be served at the fireside, she said; and she placed before me a little round stand with my cup and a plate of toast, absolutely as she used to accommodate me with some privately purloined dainty on a nursery chair: and I smiled and obeyed her as in bygone days.\nShe wanted to know if I was happy at Thornfield Hall, and what sort of a person the mistress was; and when I told her there was only a master, whether he was a nice gentleman, and if I liked him. I told her he was rather an ugly man, but quite a gentleman; and that he treated me kindly, and I was content. Then I went on to describe to her the gay company that had lately been staying at the house; and to these details Bessie listened with interest: they were precisely of the kind she relished.\nIn such conversation an hour was soon gone: Bessie restored to me my bonnet, &c., and, accompanied by her, I quitted the lodge for the hall.",

I stopped there briefly before heading up to the main house. It was extremely tidy and clean; small white curtains adorned the decorative windows, the floor was spotless, the fireplace grate and tools were brightly polished, and a fire burned clearly. Bessie was seated by the hearth, cradling her youngest child, while Robert and his sister played quietly in a corner. \"Bless you! I just knew you'd arrive!\" Mrs. Leaven exclaimed as I stepped inside. \"Yes, Bessie,\" I replied after kissing her, \"and I hope I haven't come too late. How is Mrs. Reed? I hope she's still alive.\" \"Yes, she is still alive, and more lucid and composed than before. The doctor believes she might last another week or two, but he doesn't anticipate her eventual recovery.\" \"Has she mentioned me recently?\" \"She was discussing you just this morning and wishing you would come, but she's asleep now, or at least she was ten minutes ago when I visited the house. She typically stays in a drowsy state throughout the afternoon and wakes up around six or seven. Would you like to rest here for an hour, Miss, and then I'll accompany you?\" At that moment, Robert entered, and Bessie placed her sleeping baby in the cradle to greet him. Afterward, she insisted I remove my hat and have some tea, saying I looked pale and tired. I was grateful to accept her offer of hospitality and submitted to being relieved of my travel clothes just as passively as I used to let her dress and undress me when I was a child. Old memories flooded back quickly as I observed her busy activity – setting out the tea service with her best china, slicing bread and butter, toasting a tea-cake, and occasionally giving little Robert or Jane a slight tap or nudge between tasks, precisely as she used to do to me in the past. Bessie had kept her quick temper along with her nimble movements and pleasant appearance. Once tea was ready, I started to approach the table, but she told me to stay seated, speaking in her familiar commanding tone. She declared I must be served by the fireplace and placed a small round stand before me with my cup and a plate of toast, exactly as she used to sneak me forbidden treats on a nursery chair. I smiled and obeyed her, just as I had done in years gone by. She inquired if I was happy at Thornfield Hall and what kind of person the mistress was. When I informed her there was only a master, she asked if he was a kind gentleman and if I liked him. I told her he was rather plain-looking but quite a gentleman, that he treated me well, and I was content. I then went on to describe the lively group of guests who had recently been staying at the house, and Bessie listened to these details with great interest; they were exactly the sort of stories she enjoyed. An hour passed quickly in such conversation. Bessie handed back my hat, etc., and I left the lodge for the main house, accompanied by her.",

Bessie was by the fireplace, holding her youngest child, while Robert and his sister quietly played in a corner. As I entered, Mrs. Leaven greeted me warmly, saying she knew I would come. After embracing Bessie, I asked if Mrs. Reed was still alive, and Bessie told me she was, though the doctor didn’t think she would recover, even if she lingered for another week or two. Bessie said Mrs. Reed had spoken about me that very morning, hoping I would visit, though she was now asleep, as was her routine in the afternoons.

When Robert entered, Bessie put her baby in the cradle and welcomed him, then insisted I remove my bonnet and have some tea since I looked pale and weary. I appreciated her hospitality and allowed her to help me, just as she had when I was a child. Memories of earlier days came back as I watched her prepare tea with her best dishes and food, occasionally scolding the children as she once did with me. Bessie’s lively temperament and appearance hadn’t changed. When the tea was ready, she made me sit by the fire and served me there, recalling how she used to sneak me treats as a child. I smiled and obeyed as before. She asked about my life at Thornfield Hall, inquiring about my happiness and my employer. I explained there was only a master at Thornfield, who was rather unattractive but courteous and kind to me, and I was content. I described the recent visitors at the house, stories Bessie enjoyed hearing.

          "text_segment": "It was also accompanied by her that I had, nearly nine years ago, walked down the path I was now ascending. On a dark, misty, raw morning in January, I had left a hostile roof with a desperate and embittered heart—a sense of outlawry and almost of reprobation—to seek the chilly harbourage of Lowood: that bourne so far away and unexplored. The same hostile roof now again rose before me: my prospects were doubtful yet; and I had yet an aching heart. I still felt as a wanderer on the face of the earth; but I experienced firmer trust in myself and my own powers, and less withering dread of oppression. The gaping wound of my wrongs, too, was now quite healed; and the flame of resentment extinguished.\n“You shall go into the breakfast-room first,” said Bessie, as she preceded me through the hall; “the young ladies will be there.”\nIn another moment I was within that apartment. There was every article of furniture looking just as it did on the morning I was first introduced to Mr. Brocklehurst: the very rug he had stood upon still covered the hearth. Glancing at the bookcases, I thought I could distinguish the two volumes of Bewick’s British Birds occupying their old place on the third shelf, and Gulliver’s Travels and the Arabian Nights ranged just above. The inanimate objects were not changed; but the living things had altered past recognition.\nTwo young ladies appeared before me; one very tall, almost as tall as Miss Ingram—very thin too, with a sallow face and severe mien. There was something ascetic in her look, which was augmented by the extreme plainness of a straight-skirted, black, stuff dress, a starched linen collar, hair combed away from the temples, and the nun-like ornament of a string of ebony beads and a crucifix. This I felt sure was Eliza, though I could trace little resemblance to her former self in that elongated and colourless visage.\nThe other was as certainly Georgiana: but not the Georgiana I remembered—the slim and fairy-like girl of eleven. This was a full-blown, very plump damsel, fair as waxwork, with handsome and regular features, languishing blue eyes, and ringleted yellow hair. The hue of her dress was black too; but its fashion was so different from her sister’s—so much more flowing and becoming—it looked as stylish as the other’s looked puritanical.\nIn each of the sisters there was one trait of the mother—and only one; the thin and pallid elder daughter had her parent’s Cairngorm eye: the blooming and luxuriant younger girl had her contour of jaw and chin—perhaps a little softened, but still imparting an indescribable hardness to the countenance otherwise so voluptuous and buxom.\nBoth ladies, as I advanced, rose to welcome me, and both addressed me by the name of “Miss Eyre.” Eliza’s greeting was delivered in a short, abrupt voice, without a smile; and then she sat down again, fixed her eyes on the fire, and seemed to forget me. Georgiana added to her “How d’ye do?” several commonplaces about my journey, the weather, and so on, uttered in rather a drawling tone: and accompanied by sundry side-glances that measured me from head to foot—now traversing the folds of my drab merino pelisse, and now lingering on the plain trimming of my cottage bonnet. Young ladies have a remarkable way of letting you know that they think you a “quiz” without actually saying the words. A certain superciliousness of look, coolness of manner, nonchalance of tone, express fully their sentiments on the point, without committing them by any positive rudeness in word or deed.\nA sneer, however, whether covert or open, had now no longer that power over me it once possessed: as I sat between my cousins, I was surprised to find how easy I felt under the total neglect of the one and the semi-sarcastic attentions of the other—Eliza did not mortify, nor Georgiana ruffle me. The fact was, I had other things to think about; within the last few months feelings had been stirred in me so much more potent than any they could raise—pains and pleasures so much more acute and exquisite had been excited than any it was in their power to inflict or bestow—that their airs gave me no concern either for good or bad.\n“How is Mrs. Reed?” I asked soon, looking calmly at Georgiana, who thought fit to bridle at the direct address, as if it were an unexpected liberty.\n“Mrs. Reed? Ah! mama, you mean; she is extremely poorly: I doubt if you can see her to-night.”\n“If,” said I, “you would just step upstairs and tell her I am come, I should be much obliged to you.”\nGeorgiana almost started, and she opened her blue eyes wild and wide. “I know she had a particular wish to see me,” I added, “and I would not defer attending to her desire longer than is absolutely necessary.”\n“Mama dislikes being disturbed in an evening,” remarked Eliza. I soon rose, quietly took off my bonnet and gloves, uninvited, and said I would just step out to Bessie—who was, I dared say, in the kitchen—and ask her to ascertain whether Mrs. Reed was disposed to receive me or not to-night. I went, and having found Bessie and despatched her on my errand, I proceeded to take further measures. It had heretofore been my habit always to shrink from arrogance: received as I had been to-day, I should, a year ago, have resolved to quit Gateshead the very next morning; now, it was disclosed to me all at once that that would be a foolish plan. I had taken a journey of a hundred miles to see my aunt, and I must stay with her till she was better—or dead: as to her daughters’ pride or folly, I must put it on one side, make myself independent of it. So I addressed the housekeeper; asked her to show me a room, told her I should probably be a visitor here for a week or two, had my trunk conveyed to my chamber, and followed it thither myself: I met Bessie on the landing.",
          "paraphrase_gemini-2.5-flash-preview-04-17": "I ascended the path accompanied by Bessie, just as I had walked down it with her nearly nine years prior. That previous occasion was a dark, damp, and biting January morning when I left a hostile home with a desperate and bitter heart, feeling like an outcast, almost damned, bound for the cold refuge of Lowood, a distant and unfamiliar place. Now, that same unwelcoming house appeared before me again; my future remained uncertain, and my heart still ached. Although I still felt like a wanderer, I had gained greater confidence in myself and my abilities, and my fear of hardship was less overwhelming. The deep wound from the injustices I had suffered was now entirely healed, and my anger had faded away. Bessie suggested, \"You should enter the breakfast room first,\" as she led me through the hall. Moments later, I was inside. Every piece of furniture appeared exactly as it had the morning Mr. Brocklehurst was first introduced to me; the same rug he had stood on still lay by the fireplace. Looking at the bookshelves, I believed I could make out the two volumes of Bewick's British Birds still in their old spot on the third shelf, with Gulliver's Travels and the Arabian Nights positioned directly above them. The inanimate items were unchanged, but the people were transformed beyond recognition. Two young women stood before me. One was exceptionally tall, nearly as tall as Miss Ingram, and very thin, with a pale complexion and a stern expression. Her appearance had an ascetic quality, emphasized by her exceedingly plain, straight-cut black wool dress, a stiff linen collar, hair pulled back from her temples, and a simple, nun-like accessory: a string of black beads with a crucifix. I was certain this was Eliza, though I saw little likeness to the person she used to be in her long, pallid face. The other was undoubtedly Georgiana, but she was not the Georgiana I recalled – the slender, delicate girl of eleven. This woman was fully developed and quite plump, with skin as fair as wax. She possessed attractive, well-proportioned features, dreamy blue eyes, and golden hair styled in ringlets. Her dress was also black, but its style contrasted sharply with her sister's; it was much more flowing and flattering, appearing fashionable compared to Eliza's puritanical attire. Each sister displayed just one characteristic inherited from their mother. The thin, pale older daughter had her mother's distinct, stone-like eyes (Cairngorm eye). The vibrant and well-developed younger girl had her mother's jaw and chin shape, possibly slightly softened, but still adding a subtle, hard quality to a face that was otherwise so sensuous and full-bodied. As I came closer, both ladies stood up to greet me and addressed me as \"Miss Eyre.\" Eliza's welcome was brief and sharp, delivered without a smile, after which she resumed her seat, fixed her gaze on the fire, and appeared to ignore me. Georgiana followed her \"How do you do?\" with a few conventional remarks about my journey, the weather, etc., spoken in a somewhat drawling manner. She also cast several side-long glances that scrutinized me from head to toe, examining the folds of my dull brown wool coat and lingering on the simple trim of my simple bonnet. Young ladies possess a remarkable knack for conveying that they consider you eccentric or odd without explicitly stating it. A certain haughtiness in their look, a cool demeanor, and an indifferent tone effectively communicate their feelings on the matter, without resorting to overt verbal or behavioral rudeness. However, neither hidden nor overt contempt held the sway over me it once did. Sitting between my cousins, I was surprised by how comfortable I felt despite the complete disregard from one and the slightly mocking attention from the other. Eliza did not humiliate me, nor did Georgiana irritate me. The truth was, my mind was occupied with other matters. In recent months, emotions far more powerful than any they could evoke had been stirred within me; I had experienced pains and joys far more intense and profound than anything they were capable of inflicting or giving. Consequently, their behavior did not affect me in any way, positive or negative. Soon, I calmly asked Georgiana, \"How is Mrs. Reed?\" She seemed to react stiffly to being addressed directly, as if it were an inappropriate familiarity. \"Mrs. Reed? Oh, you mean Mama,\" she replied, \"She is very unwell. I doubt you can see her tonight.\" I said, \"If you wouldn't mind going upstairs just to inform her of my arrival, I would be very grateful.\" Georgiana looked visibly startled, her blue eyes opening wide in surprise. \"I am aware she specifically wanted to see me,\" I explained, \"and I don't wish to postpone fulfilling her wish any longer than absolutely necessary.\" Eliza interjected, \"Mama doesn't like to be disturbed in the evening.\" Without waiting for permission, I promptly stood up, calmly removed my bonnet and gloves, and stated that I would go find Bessie, who I assumed was in the kitchen, and ask her to find out if Mrs. Reed was willing to see me that evening. I went, located Bessie, and sent her on my request. I then decided on my next steps. Previously, I would always recoil from arrogant behavior. Having been treated as I was today, a year ago I would have decided to leave Gateshead the very next morning. Now, it suddenly became clear to me that such a plan would be unwise. I had traveled a hundred miles to see my aunt, and I needed to remain with her until she recovered or passed away. As for her daughters' arrogance or foolishness, I had to disregard it and ensure I wasn't affected by it. Therefore, I spoke to the housekeeper, asked her to show me a room, informed her I would likely be staying for one or two weeks, had my trunk taken to my bedroom, and followed it myself. I encountered Bessie on the stairs.",
          "paraphrase_gpt-4.1-2025-04-14": "Nearly nine years earlier, I had walked this same path with her, but at that time I was leaving behind an unwelcoming home, feeling desperate and outcast, searching for uncertain refuge at Lowood—a place distant and unknown to me. Now, as I returned, the same unfriendly house appeared before me and my future still seemed unclear, with my heart still aching. However, I was stronger now, with more confidence in myself and less fear of being oppressed. The pain of past injustices had finally healed, and my anger had faded away.\n\nBessie led me into the breakfast-room, saying the young ladies would be there. I noticed everything looked just as it had when I first met Mr. Brocklehurst—including the rug by the fireplace. The books—Bewick’s British Birds, Gulliver’s Travels, and Arabian Nights—were all in their usual places. The furniture hadn’t changed, but the people had.\n\nTwo young women greeted me: the first, very tall and thin with a pale, severe face—dressed plainly in a black dress and wearing a crucifix—was unmistakably Eliza, though she looked little like the girl I remembered. The second was clearly Georgiana, but she had changed from the slender girl I once knew into a plump, fair young woman, strikingly pretty with blue eyes and yellow curls. Both wore black, but Georgiana’s stylish dress contrasted sharply with Eliza’s severe attire.\n\nEach sister bore a single feature from their mother: Eliza had her mother’s eyes, and Georgiana had inherited the shape of her jaw and chin, which gave an underlying hardness to her otherwise soft appearance.\n\nAs I entered, both women stood and greeted me as “Miss Eyre.” Eliza's welcome was brief and cold, after which she returned to the fire, ignoring me. Georgiana offered a few polite remarks about my journey and the weather, but her tone was lazy, and she surveyed me with critical glances, assessing my simple clothing. Young women have a talent for expressing disdain without overt rudeness—through their looks, manner, and tone they make their opinions clear.\n\nYet their coldness and condescension no longer affected me as it once did. I was surprised at how little I cared about their neglect or thinly veiled criticism. My recent experiences had made me feel deeper pain and greater happiness than they could ever give. Their attitudes simply didn’t matter to me anymore.\n\nI soon asked after Mrs. Reed, directing my question calmly to Georgiana, who seemed surprised by my straightforwardness. She told me her mother was quite unwell and doubted I could see her that night. I insisted, asking her kindly to inform Mrs. Reed of my arrival, explaining that I didn’t want to delay fulfilling my aunt’s wish to see me. Both sisters were surprised, but Eliza only remarked that their mother disliked being disturbed in the evening.\n\nUninvited, I quietly removed my bonnet and gloves and told them I would ask Bessie to check if Mrs. Reed could receive me. I found Bessie in the kitchen and sent her on my errand. Previously, I would have felt intimidated and perhaps would have left the next day—but now I realized that would be silly. I had traveled a hundred miles to see my aunt and would stay until she was better or had passed away. I resolved to ignore her daughters’ pride and folly.\n\nI spoke to the housekeeper, asked to be shown a room, told her I’d likely stay a week or two, and had my trunk brought to my chamber. On my way, I met Bessie on the landing."

          "text_segment": "“Missis is awake,” said she; “I have told her you are here: come and let us see if she will know you.”\nI did not need to be guided to the well-known room, to which I had so often been summoned for chastisement or reprimand in former days. I hastened before Bessie; I softly opened the door: a shaded light stood on the table, for it was now getting dark. There was the great four-post bed with amber hangings as of old; there the toilet-table, the armchair, and the footstool, at which I had a hundred times been sentenced to kneel, to ask pardon for offences by me uncommitted. I looked into a certain corner near, half-expecting to see the slim outline of a once dreaded switch which used to lurk there, waiting to leap out imp-like and lace my quivering palm or shrinking neck. I approached the bed; I opened the curtains and leant over the high-piled pillows.\nWell did I remember Mrs. Reed’s face, and I eagerly sought the familiar image. It is a happy thing that time quells the longings of vengeance and hushes the promptings of rage and aversion. I had left this woman in bitterness and hate, and I came back to her now with no other emotion than a sort of ruth for her great sufferings, and a strong yearning to forget and forgive all injuries—to be reconciled and clasp hands in amity.\nThe well-known face was there: stern, relentless as ever—there was that peculiar eye which nothing could melt, and the somewhat raised, imperious, despotic eyebrow. How often had it lowered on me menace and hate! and how the recollection of childhood’s terrors and sorrows revived as I traced its harsh line now! And yet I stooped down and kissed her: she looked at me.\n“Is this Jane Eyre?” she said.\n“Yes, Aunt Reed. How are you, dear aunt?”\nI had once vowed that I would never call her aunt again: I thought it no sin to forget and break that vow now. My fingers had fastened on her hand which lay outside the sheet: had she pressed mine kindly, I should at that moment have experienced true pleasure. But unimpressionable natures are not so soon softened, nor are natural antipathies so readily eradicated. Mrs. Reed took her hand away, and, turning her face rather from me, she remarked that the night was warm. Again she regarded me so icily, I felt at once that her opinion of me—her feeling towards me—was unchanged and unchangeable. I knew by her stony eye—opaque to tenderness, indissoluble to tears—that she was resolved to consider me bad to the last; because to believe me good would give her no generous pleasure: only a sense of mortification.\nI felt pain, and then I felt ire; and then I felt a determination to subdue her—to be her mistress in spite both of her nature and her will. My tears had risen, just as in childhood: I ordered them back to their source. I brought a chair to the bed-head: I sat down and leaned over the pillow.\n“You sent for me,” I said, “and I am here; and it is my intention to stay till I see how you get on.”\n“Oh, of course! You have seen my daughters?”\n“Yes.”\n“Well, you may tell them I wish you to stay till I can talk some things over with you I have on my mind: to-night it is too late, and I have a difficulty in recalling them. But there was something I wished to say—let me see—”\nThe wandering look and changed utterance told what wreck had taken place in her once vigorous frame. Turning restlessly, she drew the bedclothes round her; my elbow, resting on a corner of the quilt, fixed it down: she was at once irritated.\n“Sit up!” said she; “don’t annoy me with holding the clothes fast. Are you Jane Eyre?”\n“I am Jane Eyre.”\n“I have had more trouble with that child than any one would believe. Such a burden to be left on my hands—and so much annoyance as she caused me, daily and hourly, with her incomprehensible disposition, and her sudden starts of temper, and her continual, unnatural watchings of one’s movements! I declare she talked to me once like something mad, or like a fiend—no child ever spoke or looked as she did; I was glad to get her away from the house. What did they do with her at Lowood? The fever broke out there, and many of the pupils died. She, however, did not die: but I said she did—I wish she had died!”\n“A strange wish, Mrs. Reed; why do you hate her so?”\n“I had a dislike to her mother always; for she was my husband’s only sister, and a great favourite with him: he opposed the family’s disowning her when she made her low marriage; and when news came of her death, he wept like a simpleton. He would send for the baby; though I entreated him rather to put it out to nurse and pay for its maintenance. I hated it the first time I set my eyes on it—a sickly, whining, pining thing! It would wail in its cradle all night long—not screaming heartily like any other child, but whimpering and moaning. Reed pitied it; and he used to nurse it and notice it as if it had been his own: more, indeed, than he ever noticed his own at that age. He would try to make my children friendly to the little beggar: the darlings could not bear it, and he was angry with them when they showed their dislike. In his last illness, he had it brought continually to his bedside; and but an hour before he died, he bound me by vow to keep the creature. I would as soon have been charged with a pauper brat out of a workhouse: but he was weak, naturally weak. John does not at all resemble his father, and I am glad of it: John is like me and like my brothers—he is quite a Gibson. Oh, I wish he would cease tormenting me with letters for money! I have no more money to give him: we are getting poor. I must send away half the servants and shut up part of the house; or let it off. I can never submit to do that—yet how are we to get on? Two-thirds of my income goes in paying the interest of mortgages. John gambles dreadfully, and always loses—poor boy! He is beset by sharpers: John is sunk and degraded—his look is frightful—I feel ashamed for him when I see him.”\nShe was getting much excited. “I think I had better leave her now,” said I to Bessie, who stood on the other side of the bed.\n“Perhaps you had, Miss: but she often talks in this way towards night—in the morning she is calmer.”\nI rose. “Stop!” exclaimed Mrs. Reed, “there is another thing I wished to say. He threatens me—he continually threatens me with his own death, or mine: and I dream sometimes that I see him laid out with a great wound in his throat, or with a swollen and blackened face. I am come to a strange pass: I have heavy troubles. What is to be done? How is the money to be had?”\nBessie now endeavoured to persuade her to take a sedative draught: she succeeded with difficulty. Soon after, Mrs. Reed grew more composed, and sank into a dozing state. I then left her.",
          "paraphrase_gemini-2.5-flash-preview-04-17": "She announced, \"Your mistress is awake; I've informed her you're present: let's go see if she recognizes you.\" I didn't require directions to the familiar room, the place where I had so often been summoned for discipline or lectures in earlier times. I hurried ahead of Bessie, gently opening the door. A lamp with a shade cast a dim light on the table, as darkness was falling. The large four-poster bed with its amber hangings looked just as it used to; the dressing table, armchair, and footstool were still there – the very spot where I had been ordered countless times to kneel and ask forgiveness for wrongdoings I hadn't committed. I even glanced towards a nearby corner, half expecting to see the slender shape of a feared switch that once lurked there, ready to spring out like an imp and strike my trembling hand or sensitive neck. I approached the bed, pulled back the curtains, and leaned over the pile of pillows.",
          "paraphrase_gpt-4.1-2025-04-14": "\"Missis is awake,\" Bessie told me, \"and I've told her you've come: let's go see if she recognizes you.\" There was no need for Bessie to show me the familiar room where I’d been called numerous times for punishment when I was younger; I entered quickly, ahead of her. The room was dimly lit by a lamp—it was nearly night. The large, four-poster bed with its amber curtains was unchanged, as were the dressing table, armchair, and the footstool where I’d so often been made to kneel and beg forgiveness for things I hadn’t done. I glanced towards the corner where the thin rod used to lurk, ready to strike my hands or neck, and approached the bed, gently drawing aside the curtains and leaning over the pillows. I remembered Mrs. Reed’s face well and searched for the features I knew so well. It’s fortunate that time calms thoughts of revenge and quiets anger. Though I had left this woman feeling bitter and angry, I returned now feeling only pity for her suffering and a strong desire to forgive and be reconciled. Her face was the same: stern and unyielding, with that cold, commanding look, and an eyebrow expressing constant disapproval. This had often frightened me as a child, but now I bent over and kissed her. She looked at me. “Is this Jane Eyre?” she asked. “Yes, Aunt Reed. How are you, dear aunt?” I had once sworn I’d never call her aunt again, but I didn’t regret breaking that promise. I held her hand; had she returned the gesture kindly, I would have been truly happy. But someone as emotionally distant as her wasn't easily softened; she pulled her hand away and remarked on the warm night. She then looked at me with the same coldness, showing her opinion of me hadn’t changed. Her eyes were unmoved by kindness or emotion; she was determined to always think badly of me because recognizing my goodness would only hurt her pride. I felt hurt, then angry, then determined to win her over despite herself. Tears came as they did in my childhood, but I pushed them back. I took a seat by her pillow. “You asked for me,” I said, “and I’m here to see how you are.” “Oh, of course! Have you seen my daughters?” “Yes.” “Tell them I want you to stay for a while, so I can discuss some things with you—though tonight it’s too late, and I can’t remember them clearly. There’s something I meant to say—let me think—” Her unfocused look and faltering speech showed how weak she’d become. She shifted in bed, pulling the covers around her; my elbow, resting on the quilt, stopped her and she became annoyed. “Sit up! Don’t pin down the sheets. Are you Jane Eyre?” “I am Jane Eyre.” “That child has caused me more trouble than anyone would believe: such trouble left in my care—constantly annoying me with her strange moods, sudden tempers, always watching. Once she spoke to me like a mad thing, or a demon—no child ever behaved as she did. I was relieved to send her away. What happened at Lowood? There was a disease outbreak and many died. She survived, but I told people she hadn’t—I wish she had died!” “That is a strange wish, Mrs. Reed; why do you hate her?” “I always disliked her mother—she was my husband’s only sister, and he liked her best. He disagreed with the family for rejecting her after she married beneath her, and when she died, he grieved deeply, and insisted on taking the baby in, though I begged him to let someone else take care of her. I hated her as soon as I saw her, a sick, pathetic thing who whined all night. Reed pitied her and treated her as better than his own children. He wanted my children to be friendly with her, but they despised her, and he got angry at them. On his deathbed, he made me promise to look after her. I would have rather taken in a workhouse child—but he was weak. John is nothing like him, and I’m glad—John is like me and my brothers. I wish John would stop pestering me for money! I have none left: we’re becoming poor. I may have to let some servants go or rent out part of the house, but I can’t bear that. Most of my income pays mortgage interest. John gambles and always loses; he’s tricked by swindlers, degraded and shameful to see.\" She became more agitated. “I think I should leave her now,” I said to Bessie. “Perhaps you should, Miss: she often gets like this in the evening, but is calmer in the morning.” I got up. “Wait!” cried Mrs. Reed. “There was something else—I’m threatened by him all the time, threatened with my own death or his. I dream of him dead with a horrible face. I’m in a terrible situation. What can be done? Where will I get money?” Bessie tried to get her to take some medicine and eventually succeeded. Mrs. Reed then became more restful, and I left her."

          "text_segment": "More than ten days elapsed before I had again any conversation with her. She continued either delirious or lethargic; and the doctor forbade everything which could painfully excite her. Meantime, I got on as well as I could with Georgiana and Eliza. They were very cold, indeed, at first. Eliza would sit half the day sewing, reading, or writing, and scarcely utter a word either to me or her sister. Georgiana would chatter nonsense to her canary bird by the hour, and take no notice of me. But I was determined not to seem at a loss for occupation or amusement: I had brought my drawing materials with me, and they served me for both.\nProvided with a case of pencils, and some sheets of paper, I used to take a seat apart from them, near the window, and busy myself in sketching fancy vignettes, representing any scene that happened momentarily to shape itself in the ever-shifting kaleidoscope of imagination: a glimpse of sea between two rocks; the rising moon, and a ship crossing its disk; a group of reeds and water-flags, and a naiad’s head, crowned with lotus-flowers, rising out of them; an elf sitting in a hedge-sparrow’s nest, under a wreath of hawthorn-bloom.\nOne morning I fell to sketching a face: what sort of a face it was to be, I did not care or know. I took a soft black pencil, gave it a broad point, and worked away. Soon I had traced on the paper a broad and prominent forehead and a square lower outline of visage: that contour gave me pleasure; my fingers proceeded actively to fill it with features. Strongly-marked horizontal eyebrows must be traced under that brow; then followed, naturally, a well-defined nose, with a straight ridge and full nostrils; then a flexible-looking mouth, by no means narrow; then a firm chin, with a decided cleft down the middle of it: of course, some black whiskers were wanted, and some jetty hair, tufted on the temples, and waved above the forehead. Now for the eyes: I had left them to the last, because they required the most careful working. I drew them large; I shaped them well: the eyelashes I traced long and sombre; the irids lustrous and large. “Good! but not quite the thing,” I thought, as I surveyed the effect: “they want more force and spirit;” and I wrought the shades blacker, that the lights might flash more brilliantly—a happy touch or two secured success. There, I had a friend’s face under my gaze; and what did it signify that those young ladies turned their backs on me? I looked at it; I smiled at the speaking likeness: I was absorbed and content.\n“Is that a portrait of some one you know?” asked Eliza, who had approached me unnoticed. I responded that it was merely a fancy head, and hurried it beneath the other sheets. Of course, I lied: it was, in fact, a very faithful representation of Mr. Rochester. But what was that to her, or to any one but myself? Georgiana also advanced to look. The other drawings pleased her much, but she called that “an ugly man.” They both seemed surprised at my skill. I offered to sketch their portraits; and each, in turn, sat for a pencil outline. Then Georgiana produced her album. I promised to contribute a water-colour drawing: this put her at once into good humour. She proposed a walk in the grounds. Before we had been out two hours, we were deep in a confidential conversation: she had favoured me with a description of the brilliant winter she had spent in London two seasons ago—of the admiration she had there excited—the attention she had received; and I even got hints of the titled conquest she had made. In the course of the afternoon and evening these hints were enlarged on: various soft conversations were reported, and sentimental scenes represented; and, in short, a volume of a novel of fashionable life was that day improvised by her for my benefit. The communications were renewed from day to day: they always ran on the same theme—herself, her loves, and woes. It was strange she never once adverted either to her mother’s illness, or her brother’s death, or the present gloomy state of the family prospects. Her mind seemed wholly taken up with reminiscences of past gaiety, and aspirations after dissipations to come. She passed about five minutes each day in her mother’s sick-room, and no more.\nEliza still spoke little: she had evidently no time to talk. I never saw a busier person than she seemed to be; yet it was difficult to say what she did: or rather, to discover any result of her diligence. She had an alarm to call her up early. I know not how she occupied herself before breakfast, but after that meal she divided her time into regular portions, and each hour had its allotted task. Three times a day she studied a little book, which I found, on inspection, was a Common Prayer Book. I asked her once what was the great attraction of that volume, and she said, “the Rubric.” Three hours she gave to stitching, with gold thread, the border of a square crimson cloth, almost large enough for a carpet. In answer to my inquiries after the use of this article, she informed me it was a covering for the altar of a new church lately erected near Gateshead. Two hours she devoted to her diary; two to working by herself in the kitchen-garden; and one to the regulation of her accounts. She seemed to want no company; no conversation. I believe she was happy in her way: this routine sufficed for her; and nothing annoyed her so much as the occurrence of any incident which forced her to vary its clockwork regularity.\nShe told me one evening, when more disposed to be communicative than usual, that John’s conduct, and the threatened ruin of the family, had been a source of profound affliction to her: but she had now, she said, settled her mind, and formed her resolution. Her own fortune she had taken care to secure; and when her mother died—and it was wholly improbable, she tranquilly remarked, that she should either recover or linger long—she would execute a long-cherished project: seek a retirement where punctual habits would be permanently secured from disturbance, and place safe barriers between herself and a frivolous world. I asked if Georgiana would accompany her.",
          "paraphrase_gemini-2.5-flash-preview-04-17": "More than a week passed before I spoke with her again; she remained either delirious or very tired, and the doctor prohibited anything that might upset her. Meanwhile, I did my best to get along with Georgiana and Eliza. Initially, they were quite cold towards me. Eliza would spend much of her day sewing, reading, or writing, barely speaking to either me or her sister. Georgiana would chatter nonsensically to her pet bird for long periods, paying me no attention. Determined not to appear idle or bored, I used my drawing materials, which served both purposes. With my pencils and paper, I would sit separately by the window, sketching imaginative scenes that formed in my constantly changing thoughts. These included visions like the sea seen between rocks, the rising moon with a ship crossing it, a group of water plants with a naiad's head appearing among them, or a small elf perched in a bird's nest under a cluster of hawthorn flowers. One morning, I began sketching a face, not caring what kind it would be. I took a soft black pencil, sharpened it broadly, and started drawing. Quickly, I outlined a wide, prominent forehead and a strong, angular lower face shape; I liked this contour, and my fingers swiftly added the features. I drew strong horizontal eyebrows under the brow, followed by a well-defined nose with a straight bridge and full nostrils, then a seemingly flexible, fairly wide mouth, and finally a firm chin with a distinct vertical dimple. Of course, dark whiskers and some thick, wavy black hair over the forehead were necessary. The eyes were the last part, requiring the most care. I made them large and well-shaped, tracing long, dark eyelashes and large, bright irises. 'Good, but not quite right,' I thought, examining the result, 'they need more strength and intensity.' I darkened the shadows to make the highlights more brilliant, and a few successful touches finished it. There, I had the face of a friend before me; it didn't matter that the young ladies ignored me. I gazed at it, smiled at the striking resemblance, feeling engrossed and content. 'Is that a portrait of someone you know?' asked Eliza, who had approached quietly. I replied that it was just an imaginary head and quickly slipped it under my other papers. Naturally, I was lying; it was actually a very accurate likeness of Mr. Rochester. But that was irrelevant to her, or anyone but myself. Georgiana also came to look. She liked the other drawings very much but called the face sketch 'an ugly man.' Both sisters seemed impressed by my skill. I offered to draw them, and each sat for a pencil outline. Then Georgiana brought out her album. I promised to contribute a watercolour, which instantly put her in a good mood. She suggested we take a walk on the grounds. Within two hours of being outside, we were having a private conversation. She shared details of the exciting winter she had spent in London two years prior, describing the admiration she received and the attention she attracted, even hinting at a conquest involving a titled gentleman. Throughout the afternoon and evening, she elaborated on these hints, recounting romantic conversations and sentimental moments, essentially improvising a narrative of fashionable life for my entertainment that day. These discussions continued daily, always focusing on the same subject: herself, her romances, and her troubles. It was peculiar that she never once mentioned her mother's illness, her brother's death, or the family's current dire situation. Her mind seemed entirely preoccupied with memories of past pleasures and anticipation of future social events. She spent only about five minutes each day in her mother's sickroom. Eliza still spoke little, clearly having no time for talk. I never saw anyone seem busier than she was, though it was hard to say exactly what she did or discern any tangible results from her efforts. An alarm clock woke her early. I don't know how she occupied herself before breakfast, but after that meal, she divided her time into fixed segments, with each hour having its assigned task. Three times a day, she studied a small book which I found, upon inspection, was a Common Prayer Book. I once asked her what made the book so appealing, and she replied, 'the Rubric.' She spent three hours sewing a border with gold thread onto a large square of crimson cloth, explaining it was an altar covering for a new church recently built near Gateshead. She dedicated two hours to her diary, two to working alone in the kitchen garden, and one to managing her finances. She seemed to have no need for company or conversation. I believe she was content in her own way; this routine was enough for her, and nothing irritated her more than anything that disrupted its precise, clockwork regularity. One evening, when she was more inclined to talk than usual, she told me that John's conduct and the family's potential ruin had caused her deep sorrow, but she had now made up her mind and formed a resolution. She had secured her own finances, and when her mother died—which she calmly noted was very unlikely to involve either recovery or a prolonged period—she would carry out a long-held plan: finding a secluded place where her strict habits could be maintained without interruption, thereby creating firm boundaries between herself and a superficial world. I asked if Georgiana would go with her.",
          "paraphrase_gpt-4.1-2025-04-14": "It was over ten days before I spoke with her again. She remained either unconscious or in a state of delirium, and the doctor prohibited anything that might unnecessarily agitate her. Meanwhile, I managed as best I could with Georgiana and Eliza, who were both quite distant at first. Eliza spent much of her time sewing, reading, or writing in silence, barely acknowledging me or Georgiana. Georgiana, on the other hand, would spend hours chatting to her canary, ignoring me completely. Determined not to appear bored or idle, I made use of the drawing supplies I had brought and occupied myself with them.\n\nArmed with pencils and paper, I would sit by the window, away from them, and lose myself in sketching imaginative scenes—perhaps a seascape glimpsed between rocks, the moon rising over a passing ship, reeds and water plants with a naiad's head, or perhaps an elf in a bird's nest entwined with blossom.\n\nOne morning, I started sketching a face without any definite idea in mind. Taking a soft pencil, I quickly drew a broad forehead and a strong jaw, which I found pleasing, and proceeded to add prominent eyebrows, a well-shaped nose, a full mouth, a dimpled chin, dark whiskers, and wavy black hair. I left the eyes for last, wanting to get them right. I drew them large and luminous, adjusting the shadows to give their gaze a lively brightness. When I finished, I was looking at a friend's face, and it didn't matter to me if the others ignored me; I was happily absorbed.\n\nEliza, approaching without my noticing, asked if it was a portrait of someone I knew. I replied it was just an imagined face and quickly covered it up—though in truth, it was a very accurate likeness of Mr. Rochester. But what concern was that of hers, or anyone's but my own? Georgiana also came to see, and while she liked the other drawings, she called this one 'an ugly man.' Both appeared impressed by my talent. I offered to sketch their portraits, and they each posed while I drew quick outlines. Georgiana then brought out her album, and I promised her a watercolor. This put her in good spirits, and she suggested a walk in the gardens. Within two hours, we were having an intimate conversation, during which she recounted her glamorous London winter two years earlier, the attention she received, and alluded to a noble admirer. The rest of the day she continued in this vein, filling it with romantic stories of her experiences, which became a regular topic—always focusing on her own affairs and feelings. Strangely, she never mentioned our mother's illness, our brother's death, or the family's grim situation. Her thoughts seemed absorbed by memories of past excitement and hopes for more. She visited her sick mother briefly each day—no more than five minutes.\n\nEliza remained reserved, focused on her many private tasks. I had never seen anyone so constantly busy, though it was hard to determine what she accomplished. She woke early with an alarm, followed a strict schedule, and allotted time to different activities. Three times daily she studied her Common Prayer Book, explaining that she was interested in the Rubric. She spent three hours stitching a gold-bordered cloth for the altar of a new church, devoted two hours to her diary, two to gardening, and another to keeping her accounts. She seemed content with her solitary regimented life and disliked any disruption. One evening, when she was more open, she confessed that John's behavior and the family's troubles had deeply saddened her, but she had resolved to protect her own inheritance and, after her mother's likely imminent death, intended to retreat to a place where she could enjoy undisturbed discipline and routine, sheltered from the superficial world. I asked if Georgiana would go with her."

Georgiana should take her own course; and she, Eliza, would take hers.”\nGeorgiana, when not unburdening her heart to me, spent most of her time in lying on the sofa, fretting about the dulness of the house, and wishing over and over again that her aunt Gibson would send her an invitation up to town. “It would be so much better,” she said, “if she could only get out of the way for a month or two, till all was over.” I did not ask what she meant by “all being over,” but I suppose she referred to the expected decease of her mother and the gloomy sequel of funeral rites. Eliza generally took no more notice of her sister’s indolence and complaints than if no such murmuring, lounging object had been before her. One day, however, as she put away her account-book and unfolded her embroidery, she suddenly took her up thus—\n“Georgiana, a more vain and absurd animal than you was certainly never allowed to cumber the earth. You had no right to be born, for you make no use of life. Instead of living for, in, and with yourself, as a reasonable being ought, you seek only to fasten your feebleness on some other person’s strength: if no one can be found willing to burden her or himself with such a fat, weak, puffy, useless thing, you cry out that you are ill-treated, neglected, miserable. Then, too, existence for you must be a scene of continual change and excitement, or else the world is a dungeon: you must be admired, you must be courted, you must be flattered—you must have music, dancing, and society—or you languish, you die away. Have you no sense to devise a system which will make you independent of all efforts, and all wills, but your own? Take one day; share it into sections; to each section apportion its task: leave no stray unemployed quarters of an hour, ten minutes, five minutes—include all; do each piece of business in its turn with method, with rigid regularity. The day will close almost before you are aware it has begun; and you are indebted to no one for helping you to get rid of one vacant moment: you have had to seek no one’s company, conversation, sympathy, forbearance; you have lived, in short, as an independent being ought to do. Take this advice: the first and last I shall offer you; then you will not want me or any one else, happen what may. Neglect it—go on as heretofore, craving, whining, and idling—and suffer the results of your idiocy, however bad and insufferable they may be. I tell you this plainly; and listen: for though I shall no more repeat what I am now about to say, I shall steadily act on it. After my mother’s death, I wash my hands of you: from the day her coffin is carried to the vault in Gateshead Church, you and I will be as separate as if we had never known each other. You need not think that because we chanced to be born of the same parents, I shall suffer you to fasten me down by even the feeblest claim: I can tell you this—if the whole human race, ourselves excepted, were swept away, and we two stood alone on the earth, I would leave you in the old world, and betake myself to the new.”\nShe closed her lips.\n“You might have spared yourself the trouble of delivering that tirade,” answered Georgiana. “Everybody knows you are the most selfish, heartless creature in existence: and I know your spiteful hatred towards me: I have had a specimen of it before in the trick you played me about Lord Edwin Vere: you could not bear me to be raised above you, to have a title, to be received into circles where you dare not show your face, and so you acted the spy and informer, and ruined my prospects for ever.” Georgiana took out her handkerchief and blew her nose for an hour afterwards; Eliza sat cold, impassable, and assiduously industrious.\nTrue, generous feeling is made small account of by some, but here were two natures rendered, the one intolerably acrid, the other despicably savourless for the want of it. Feeling without judgment is a washy draught indeed; but judgment untempered by feeling is too bitter and husky a morsel for human deglutition.",
          "paraphrase_gemini-2.5-flash-preview-04-17": "Absolutely not. Georgiana and she shared nothing in common; they never had. For no reason would she tolerate Georgiana's company. Georgiana should pursue her path, and she, Eliza, would pursue hers. When she wasn't sharing her feelings with me, Georgiana mostly lay on the sofa, grumbling about how dull the house was and repeatedly wishing her aunt Gibson would invite her to visit London. She felt it would be much better, she said, if she could just get away for a month or two until everything was concluded. I didn't ask what she meant by 'everything being concluded,' but I presumed she referred to her mother's impending death and the sad events of the funeral that would follow. Eliza typically ignored her sister's idleness and complaints as if the complaining, lounging person wasn't even there. However, one day, after putting away her ledger and starting her embroidery, she suddenly attacked Georgiana verbally like this: \"Georgiana,\" she began, \"surely no creature more vain and foolish than you has ever been allowed to burden the earth. You shouldn't have been born, because you make no use of your life. Instead of living independently, for and with yourself, as a rational person should, you merely try to latch your weakness onto someone else's strength. If you can't find anyone willing to take on the burden of such a fat, weak, puffed-up, useless thing, you declare yourself ill-treated, neglected, and miserable. Furthermore, for you, life must be a constant stream of change and excitement, or the world feels like a prison. You need to be admired, courted, and flattered; you must have music, dancing, and social gatherings, or you wither away. Do you lack the sense to devise a system that would make you reliant only on your own efforts and will? Take one day; divide it into parts; assign a task to each part. Don't leave any moments, ten minutes, five minutes, unemployed—include everything. Perform each task methodically and consistently when its turn comes. The day will end almost before you realise it started, and you won't owe anyone anything for helping you pass a single empty moment. You won't have needed anyone's company, conversation, sympathy, or patience. In short, you will have lived as an independent being should. Follow this advice; it's the first and last I'll give you. Then, no matter what happens, you won't need me or anyone else. Ignore it—continue craving, whining, and idling as before—and suffer the consequences of your foolishness, no matter how severe and unbearable they are. I'm telling you this clearly, so listen: although I won't repeat what I'm saying now, I will consistently act upon it. After my mother's death, I will disassociate myself from you. From the day her coffin is taken to the vault in Gateshead Church, you and I will be as separate as if we had never met. Don't imagine that just because we happened to be born of the same parents, I will let you tie me down with even the slightest claim. I can tell you this—if the entire human race, except for us, were wiped out, and we two stood alone on Earth, I would abandon you in the old world and make my way to the new.\" She sealed her lips. \"You could have saved yourself the trouble of delivering that rant,\" Georgiana replied. \"Everyone knows you are the most selfish, heartless person alive; and I know your malicious hatred towards me. I've seen evidence of it before in the trick you played on me about Lord Edwin Vere. You couldn't stand the thought of me being elevated above you, having a title, being accepted into social circles where you wouldn't dare show your face, so you acted as a spy and informant and ruined my prospects permanently.\" Georgiana then took out her handkerchief and cried for a prolonged period; Eliza remained cool, unaffected, and diligently occupied with her work. True, noble feeling is sometimes disregarded by some, but here were two personalities rendered, one intolerably harsh, the other contemptibly weak, due to its absence. Feeling without good sense is indeed a watery drink; but good sense unspoiled by feeling is too bitter and rough a piece to swallow for humans.",
          "paraphrase_gpt-4.1-2025-04-14": "Eliza and Georgiana had never shared any common interests and felt no inclination to spend time together; Eliza was determined not to be saddled with her sister’s company for any reason. Each would go her own way.\n\nWhile Georgiana wasn’t confiding in me, she mostly lounged on the sofa, complaining about how boring the house was and constantly wishing her Aunt Gibson would invite her to visit the city. She repeatedly said it would be much better if she could escape for a few months until everything—by which I assume she meant her mother’s impending death and the funeral—was over. Eliza generally ignored her sister’s laziness and grievances completely. However, one afternoon, as she put away her account book and started her embroidery, she suddenly spoke up.\n\n\"Georgiana, there can scarcely be a more vain and ridiculous person than you. You shouldn’t have been born since you make nothing out of your life. Instead of living independently, you just try to rely on the strength of others. And when no one is willing to carry such a lazy, weak, useless person, you claim to be mistreated and unhappy. For you, life must be a constant whirl of excitement and novelty, or else you feel imprisoned. You demand attention, praise, music, parties—otherwise you waste away. Can’t you think of a way to make yourself independent of others, of anyone’s efforts or wishes but your own? Organize each day methodically, assign tasks to every section—don’t let any time go unused. Complete your work with strict regularity. The day will be over before you know it, and you won’t have depended on anyone else to keep you busy. You’ll have needed no one’s company or sympathy, and you’ll have lived as a truly independent person should. That is my advice—the first and last I’ll ever give you. If you follow it, you won’t need me or anyone else. But if you keep on whining and shirking responsibility, you’ll have only yourself to blame for whatever miserable result you suffer. I say this directly and only once, but my actions will match my words. After our mother’s death, I’ll be done with you completely. Once her funeral is over, we shall be as apart as if we’d never met. Don’t think that just because we share parents, I’ll let you impose on me even a little. If we were the last two people left on earth, I’d leave you behind and find a new place for myself.\"\n\nShe then fell silent.\n\nGeorgiana replied, \"You needn’t have bothered giving that lecture. Everyone knows you’re the most selfish, cruel person there is—and I’m well aware of your hatred for me. You’ve shown it before, like that time you ruined my chance with Lord Edwin Vere; you couldn’t bear for me to have a higher status, a title, or to mingle with people you couldn’t approach yourself, so you spied on me, informed on me, and destroyed my prospects forever.\" Georgiana then sat and cried for an hour, while Eliza remained unmoved and diligently occupied with her work.\n\nThe story shows that, to some people, sincere and generous emotions mean little. Here, one sister is unbearably bitter, the other unbearably dull, both lacking true feeling. Emotion without judgment is weak and empty, but judgment with no feeling is harsh and indigestible for people."

Bessie was faithful; but she had her own family to mind, and could only come occasionally to the hall. I found the sick-room unwatched, as I had expected: no nurse was there; the patient lay still, and seemingly lethargic; her livid face sunk in the pillows: the fire was dying in the grate. I renewed the fuel, re-arranged the bedclothes, gazed awhile on her who could not now gaze on me, and then I moved away to the window.\nThe rain beat strongly against the panes, the wind blew tempestuously: “One lies there,” I thought, “who will soon be beyond the war of earthly elements. Whither will that spirit—now struggling to quit its material tenement—flit when at length released?”\nIn pondering the great mystery, I thought of Helen Burns, recalled her dying words—her faith—her doctrine of the equality of disembodied souls. I was still listening in thought to her well-remembered tones—still picturing her pale and spiritual aspect, her wasted face and sublime gaze, as she lay on her placid deathbed, and whispered her longing to be restored to her divine Father’s bosom—when a feeble voice murmured from the couch behind: “Who is that?”\nI knew Mrs. Reed had not spoken for days: was she reviving? I went up to her.\n“It is I, Aunt Reed.”\n“Who—I?” was her answer. “Who are you?” looking at me with surprise and a sort of alarm, but still not wildly. “You are quite a stranger to me—where is Bessie?”\n“She is at the lodge, aunt.”\n“Aunt,” she repeated. “Who calls me aunt? You are not one of the Gibsons; and yet I know you—that face, and the eyes and forehead, are quiet familiar to me: you are like—why, you are like Jane Eyre!”\nI said nothing: I was afraid of occasioning some shock by declaring my identity.\n“Yet,” said she, “I am afraid it is a mistake: my thoughts deceive me. I wished to see Jane Eyre, and I fancy a likeness where none exists: besides, in eight years she must be so changed.” I now gently assured her that I was the person she supposed and desired me to be: and seeing that I was understood, and that her senses were quite collected, I explained how Bessie had sent her husband to fetch me from Thornfield.\n“I am very ill, I know,” she said ere long. “I was trying to turn myself a few minutes since, and find I cannot move a limb. It is as well I should ease my mind before I die: what we think little of in health, burdens us at such an hour as the present is to me. Is the nurse here? or is there no one in the room but you?”\nI assured her we were alone.\n“Well, I have twice done you a wrong which I regret now. One was in breaking the promise which I gave my husband to bring you up as my own child; the other—” she stopped. “After all, it is of no great importance, perhaps,” she murmured to herself: “and then I may get better; and to humble myself so to her is painful.”\nShe made an effort to alter her position, but failed: her face changed; she seemed to experience some inward sensation—the precursor, perhaps, of the last pang.\n“Well, I must get it over. Eternity is before me: I had better tell her.—Go to my dressing-case, open it, and take out a letter you will see there.”\nI obeyed her directions. “Read the letter,” she said.\nIt was short, and thus conceived:—\n“MADAM,—\n“Will you have the goodness to send me the address of my niece, Jane Eyre, and to tell me how she is? It is my intention to write shortly and desire her to come to me at Madeira. Providence has blessed my endeavours to secure a competency; and as I am unmarried and childless, I wish to adopt her during my life, and bequeath her at my death whatever I may have to leave.\n\nI am, Madam, &c., &c.,\n“JOHN EYRE, Madeira.”\nIt was dated three years back.\n“Why did I never hear of this?” I asked.\n“Because I disliked you too fixedly and thoroughly ever to lend a hand in lifting you to prosperity. I could not forget your conduct to me, Jane—the fury with which you once turned on me; the tone in which you declared you abhorred me the worst of anybody in the world; the unchildlike look and voice with which you affirmed that the very thought of me made you sick, and asserted that I had treated you with miserable cruelty. I could not forget my own sensations when you thus started up and poured out the venom of your mind: I felt fear as if an animal that I had struck or pushed had looked up at me with human eyes and cursed me in a man’s voice.—Bring me some water! Oh, make haste!”\n“Dear Mrs. Reed,” said I, as I offered her the draught she required, “think no more of all this, let it pass away from your mind. Forgive me for my passionate language: I was a child then; eight, nine years have passed since that day.”\nShe heeded nothing of what I said; but when she had tasted the water and drawn breath, she went on thus—\n“I tell you I could not forget it; and I took my revenge: for you to be adopted by your uncle, and placed in a state of ease and comfort, was what I could not endure. I wrote to him; I said I was sorry for his disappointment, but Jane Eyre was dead: she had died of typhus fever at Lowood. Now act as you please: write and contradict my assertion—expose my falsehood as soon as you like. You were born, I think, to be my torment: my last hour is racked by the recollection of a deed which, but for you, I should never have been tempted to commit.”\n“If you could but be persuaded to think no more of it, aunt, and to regard me with kindness and forgiveness——”\n“You have a very bad disposition,” said she, “and one to this day I feel it impossible to understand: how for nine years you could be patient and quiescent under any treatment, and in the tenth break out all fire and violence, I can never comprehend.”\n“My disposition is not so bad as you think: I am passionate, but not vindictive. Many a time, as a little child, I should have been glad to love you if you would have let me; and I long earnestly to be reconciled to you now: kiss me, aunt.”\nI approached my cheek to her lips: she would not touch it. She said I oppressed her by leaning over the bed, and again demanded water. As I laid her down—for I raised her and supported her on my arm while she drank—I covered her ice-cold and clammy hand with mine: the feeble fingers shrank from my touch—the glazing eyes shunned my gaze.\n“Love me, then, or hate me, as you will,” I said at last, “you have my full and free forgiveness: ask now for God’s, and be at peace.”\nPoor, suffering woman! it was too late for her to make now the effort to change her habitual frame of mind: living, she had ever hated me—dying, she must hate me still.\nThe nurse now entered, and Bessie followed. I yet lingered half-an-hour longer, hoping to see some sign of amity: but she gave none. She was fast relapsing into stupor; nor did her mind again rally: at twelve o’clock that night she died. I was not present to close her eyes, nor were either of her daughters. They came to tell us the next morning that all was over. She was by that time laid out. Eliza and I went to look at her: Georgiana, who had burst out into loud weeping, said she dared not go. There was stretched Sarah Reed’s once robust and active frame, rigid and still: her eye of flint was covered with its cold lid; her brow and strong traits wore yet the impress of her inexorable soul. A strange and solemn object was that corpse to me. I gazed on it with gloom and pain: nothing soft, nothing sweet, nothing pitying, or hopeful, or subduing did it inspire; only a grating anguish for her woes—not my loss—and a sombre tearless dismay at the fearfulness of death in such a form.\nEliza surveyed her parent calmly. After a silence of some minutes she observed—\n“With her constitution she should have lived to a good old age: her life was shortened by trouble.” And then a spasm constricted her mouth for an instant: as it passed away she turned and left the room, and so did I. Neither of us had dropt a tear.",
          "paraphrase_gemini-2.5-flash-preview-04-17": "It was a stormy afternoon with rain and wind. Georgiana was sleeping on the couch, a novel beside her, while Eliza had gone to attend a religious service. Eliza was extremely devout and always fulfilled her religious obligations punctually, regardless of the weather, attending church three times on Sundays and for weekday prayers. I thought it best to go upstairs and see how the dying woman was doing, as she lay there largely ignored. Even the servants paid little attention, and the hired nurse often left the room when unsupervised. Bessie was reliable but preoccupied with her own family and could only visit the house occasionally. As I anticipated, the sick-room was empty; there was no nurse present. The patient lay motionless and seemed sluggish, her pale face deeply set into the pillows, and the fire in the grate was fading. I restocked the fuel, straightened the covers, and looked for a moment at the woman who could no longer look back at me. Then, I moved to the window. The rain was heavily hitting the glass, and the wind raged violently. \"Someone lies there,\" I reflected, \"who will soon be beyond the turmoil of earthly elements. Where will that soul, currently struggling to leave its physical body, go once it is finally free?\" Pondering this profound mystery, my thoughts turned to Helen Burns, remembering her final words, her unwavering faith, and her belief that souls were equal after leaving the body. I was still mentally replaying her familiar voice and picturing her frail, ethereal appearance, her wasted face and serene expression as she lay calmly dying, whispering her desire to return to her heavenly Father, when a weak voice from the bed interrupted: \"Who is that?\" Knowing Mrs. Reed hadn't spoken for several days, I wondered if she was getting better. I approached her bed. \"It's me, Aunt Reed,\" I said. \"Who... I?\" she responded, staring at me with surprise and a hint of fear, though not appearing delusional. \"Who are you?\" she asked, adding, \"You are completely unfamiliar to me. Where is Bessie?\" I told her Bessie was at the lodge. \"Aunt,\" she repeated thoughtfully. \"Who calls me aunt? You aren't one of the Gibsons, and yet I know you. That face, those eyes and forehead, they are quite recognizable to me. You resemble... why, you look like Jane Eyre!\" I remained silent, worried that revealing my identity might cause a shock. \"Still,\" she continued, \"I fear it's a mistake; my mind is deceiving me. I wanted to see Jane Eyre, and I'm imagining a resemblance where there is none. Besides, she must have changed so much in eight years.\" I then softly confirmed that I was indeed the person she believed and wished me to be. Seeing that she understood and was thinking clearly, I explained how Bessie had sent her husband to retrieve me from Thornfield. \"I know I am very ill,\" she said after a while. \"I tried to move myself a few minutes ago and found I couldn't move a single limb. It is best that I clear my conscience before I die. The things we dismiss when healthy weigh heavily on us at a time like this.\" She asked if the nurse was present or if only I was in the room. I assured her we were alone. \"Well, I have wronged you twice, and I regret it now,\" she stated. \"One wrong was failing to keep the promise I made to my husband to raise you as if you were my own child. The other...\" She paused, then murmured to herself, \"Perhaps it is not very important after all... and besides, I might recover, and humbling myself to her like this is difficult.\" She attempted to shift her position but couldn't. Her expression changed, and she seemed to experience some internal sensation, possibly the sign of her final struggle. \"Well, I must reveal it,\" she declared. \"Eternity awaits me; I should tell her.\" She instructed me, \"Go to my dressing-case, open it, and take out a letter you'll find inside.\" I followed her instructions. \"Read the letter,\" she commanded. It was brief and read as follows: \"MADAM, Please be so kind as to send me the contact information for my niece, Jane Eyre, and inform me of her well-being. I intend to write to her soon and invite her to come live with me in Madeira. Providence has helped me achieve financial security, and as I am unmarried and have no children, I wish to adopt her during my lifetime and leave her whatever I possess upon my death. I am, Madam, etc., etc., JOHN EYRE, Madeira.\" The letter was dated three years earlier. \"Why was I never told about this?\" I asked. Mrs. Reed replied, \"Because I disliked you so deeply and completely that I would never help you achieve good fortune. I could not forget how you behaved towards me, Jane—the intense anger you showed me that one time; the tone you used when you declared you detested me more than anyone in the world; the adult-like look and voice with which you insisted that the mere thought of me made you ill and claimed I had treated you with terrible cruelty. I could not forget how I felt when you suddenly stood up and unleashed your bitter feelings. I felt a fear, as if an animal I had hit or pushed had looked up at me with human eyes and cursed me like a man. Bring me some water! Oh, hurry!\" As I gave her the water she needed, I said, \"Dear Mrs. Reed, please don't dwell on all this. Let it leave your mind. Forgive my passionate words; I was just a child then. Eight or nine years have passed since that day.\" She paid no attention to what I said. However, after she had drunk the water and regained her breath, she continued, \"I am telling you I couldn't forget it, and I got my revenge. The idea of you being adopted by your uncle and living comfortably was something I could not tolerate. I wrote to him and told him I regretted his disappointment, but Jane Eyre was dead; she had died of typhus fever at Lowwood. Now, do as you wish; write and correct my statement—expose my lie whenever you like. I think you were born to be my torment; my final moments are agonizing because of the memory of an action which, if it weren't for you, I would never have been tempted to commit.\" I pleaded, \"If only you could be persuaded to stop thinking about it, aunt, and to look upon me with kindness and forgiveness...\" \"You have a very difficult nature,\" she responded, \"one that I still find impossible to understand. How you could endure any treatment patiently and passively for nine years and then erupt with such fire and aggression in the tenth is something I can never comprehend.\" I replied, \"My nature isn't as bad as you think. I am passionate, but I don't hold grudges. Many times, as a young child, I would have been happy to love you if you had allowed me, and I sincerely long to make peace with you now. Kiss me, aunt.\" I moved my cheek closer to her lips, but she refused to touch it. She claimed I was pressuring her by leaning over the bed and again requested water. As I helped her lie back down—for I had lifted and supported her on my arm while she drank—I placed my hand over her icy, damp one. Her weak fingers recoiled from my touch, and her glassy eyes avoided looking at me. \"Then love me or hate me, as you choose,\" I finally said, \"you have my complete and free forgiveness. Now, seek God's forgiveness and find peace.\" Poor, suffering woman! It was too late for her to change her deeply ingrained attitude. She had always hated me during her life, and she would continue to hate me as she died. The nurse entered, followed by Bessie. I lingered for another half-hour, hoping to see some indication of reconciliation, but there was none. She was rapidly sinking back into unconsciousness, and her mind did not recover its clarity. She passed away at midnight. I was not there when she died, nor were either of her daughters present. They informed us the following morning that she had died. By that time, she had been prepared for burial. Eliza and I went to see her; Georgiana, who was crying loudly, said she couldn't bring herself to go. There lay Sarah Reed's body, once strong and active, now stiff and motionless. Her hard eyes were closed under their cold lids, and her forehead and strong features still held the mark of her unyielding spirit. Her corpse was a strange and somber sight to me. I looked upon it with sadness and distress. It evoked nothing gentle, sweet, pitying, hopeful, or comforting; only a harsh sorrow for *her* suffering—not a sense of *my* own loss—and a dark, tearless sense of dread at the terror of death in such a manifestation. Eliza observed her mother calmly. After a few moments of silence, she commented, \"Given her health, she should have lived to a great age. Her life was cut short by hardship.\" Then, a brief spasm tightened her mouth. As it subsided, she turned and left the room, and I followed. Neither of us had shed a tear.",
          "paraphrase_gpt-4.1-2025-04-14": "The afternoon was rainy and blustery; Georgiana had dozed off on the sofa while reading a novel, and Eliza had gone to the new church for a saint’s-day service—she was extremely strict about her religious routines and never missed a service regardless of the weather. She went to church three times every Sunday and as often as there were weekday prayers. I decided to go upstairs and check on the dying woman, who seemed almost forgotten; even the servants paid her minimal attention, and the hired nurse often left the room unsupervised. Bessie was loyal but busy with her own family, only able to visit occasionally. As expected, I found the sickroom unattended; no nurse was there, and the patient, her face pallid and sunken into the pillows, appeared lethargic. The fire was low, so I added more fuel, straightened the bedding, looked at her for a while, and then went to the window. Outside, the rain lashed the glass and the wind raged. I thought, 'She will soon be beyond any earthly storms—where will her soul, about to leave its body, go?' While pondering this profound mystery, I remembered Helen Burns—her dying words, her faith, and her belief in the equality of souls after death. I mentally replayed her gentle voice and spiritual appearance, remembering how she had looked on her deathbed, longing for union with her divine Father. Suddenly, a weak voice spoke from the bed behind me: 'Who is that?' Mrs. Reed had not spoken in days; was she getting better? I approached her. 'It is I, Aunt Reed.' She asked, 'Who—I? Who are you?' She looked at me with surprise and discomfort, though not wildly, but didn’t seem to recognize me right away. 'You seem very familiar… You look like—Jane Eyre!' I kept quiet, afraid to shock her by confirming my identity. She continued, 'But perhaps I’m mistaken—eight years is a long time, and she would be changed.' I gently told her I was Jane Eyre and explained that Bessie had sent her husband to fetch me from Thornfield. 'I know I am very ill,' she said, 'I cannot move. I should ease my mind before I die. Things we brush off when healthy weigh heavily in such times as these. Is the nurse here, or are we alone?' I told her we were by ourselves. 'Well, I’ve twice wronged you and I regret it now. One was breaking my promise to my husband to raise you as my own child; the other—' she stopped, murmuring to herself that perhaps it was not important and that she might still recover, as humbling herself before me was painful. She tried unsuccessfully to move, her face showing distress. 'I must confess: eternity is near—I had better tell you. Go to my dressing-case and fetch a letter you’ll find there.' I did as she asked and read the letter at her request. It was from John Eyre in Madeira, written three years earlier, asking for my address so he could adopt me and make me his heir. 'Why did I never know of this?' I asked. She replied, 'Because my dislike for you was so intense that I would never help you prosper. I couldn’t forget how you turned on me and claimed to hate me, or your look and tone when you said my presence made you ill and that I’d treated you cruelly. I remember feeling afraid, like a wounded animal had cursed me in a human voice. Bring me some water.' I tried to comfort her, saying she should let go of these memories and forgive me for my childhood outburst, but she ignored me. After a drink, she confessed, 'I took revenge; I could not tolerate the idea of you being adopted and comfortable, so I replied to your uncle that Jane Eyre had died of typhus at Lowood. Do as you please now, write and tell him the truth; you were born to be my torment.' I pleaded with her to forgive and be reconciled, asking for a kiss, but she refused and complained when I leaned over her. When I offered comfort and covered her hand, she pulled away. 'Love me or hate me,' I told her, 'I forgive you. Seek God's forgiveness and be at peace.' Sadly, it was too late for her to change; she had always hated me and would die feeling the same. The nurse and then Bessie arrived. I stayed a while longer, wishing for a sign of forgiveness or warmth but saw none. She quickly sank into stupor and died at midnight, with neither me nor her daughters there. The next morning, we learned she was gone. Her body was laid out; Georgiana wept loudly and refused to view her, but Eliza and I did. Mrs. Reed’s body, once strong, was now cold and hard. Looking at her filled me with sadness for her suffering, dread for death in such circumstances, but not with grief for my own loss. Eliza observed that her mother’s life could have been longer if not for her troubles, showed a passing emotion, and then we both left the room without shedding a tear."

I wished to leave immediately after the funeral, but Georgiana entreated me to stay till she could get off to London, whither she was now at last invited by her uncle, Mr. Gibson, who had come down to direct his sister’s interment and settle the family affairs. Georgiana said she dreaded being left alone with Eliza; from her she got neither sympathy in her dejection, support in her fears, nor aid in her preparations; so I bore with her feeble-minded wailings and selfish lamentations as well as I could, and did my best in sewing for her and packing her dresses. It is true, that while I worked, she would idle; and I thought to myself, “If you and I were destined to live always together, cousin, we would commence matters on a different footing. I should not settle tamely down into being the forbearing party; I should assign you your share of labour, and compel you to accomplish it, or else it should be left undone: I should insist, also, on your keeping some of those drawling, half-insincere complaints hushed in your own breast. It is only because our connection happens to be very transitory, and comes at a peculiarly mournful season, that I consent thus to render it so patient and compliant on my part.”\nAt last I saw Georgiana off; but now it was Eliza’s turn to request me to stay another week. Her plans required all her time and attention, she said; she was about to depart for some unknown bourne; and all day long she stayed in her own room, her door bolted within, filling trunks, emptying drawers, burning papers, and holding no communication with any one. She wished me to look after the house, to see callers, and answer notes of condolence.\nOne morning she told me I was at liberty. “And,” she added, “I am obliged to you for your valuable services and discreet conduct! There is some difference between living with such an one as you and with Georgiana: you perform your own part in life and burden no one. To-morrow,” she continued, “I set out for the Continent. I shall take up my abode in a religious house near Lisle—a nunnery you would call it; there I shall be quiet and unmolested. I shall devote myself for a time to the examination of the Roman Catholic dogmas, and to a careful study of the workings of their system: if I find it to be, as I half suspect it is, the one best calculated to ensure the doing of all things decently and in order, I shall embrace the tenets of Rome and probably take the veil.”\nI neither expressed surprise at this resolution nor attempted to dissuade her from it. “The vocation will fit you to a hair,” I thought: “much good may it do you!”\nWhen we parted, she said: “Good-bye, cousin Jane Eyre; I wish you well: you have some sense.”\nI then returned: “You are not without sense, cousin Eliza; but what you have, I suppose, in another year will be walled up alive in a French convent. However, it is not my business, and so it suits you, I don’t much care.”\n“You are in the right,” said she; and with these words we each went our separate way. As I shall not have occasion to refer either to her or her sister again, I may as well mention here, that Georgiana made an advantageous match with a wealthy worn-out man of fashion, and that Eliza actually took the veil, and is at this day superior of the convent where she passed the period of her novitiate, and which she endowed with her fortune.",
          "paraphrase_gemini-2.5-flash-preview-04-17": "Although Mr. Rochester had granted me only a week off, I ended up staying at Gateshead for an entire month. My initial intention was to leave right after the funeral, but Georgiana pleaded with me to remain until she could depart for London. She had finally received an invitation from her uncle, Mr. Gibson, who had come to oversee his sister's burial arrangements and sort out the family's affairs. Georgiana confessed she dreaded being left alone with Eliza, from whom she received no comfort for her sadness, no support for her anxieties, and no help with her packing. Consequently, I put up with her weak complaints and self-centered sorrow as best I could, diligently helping her by sewing and packing her clothes. It was true that while I worked, she did nothing. I found myself thinking, 'If we were to live together permanently, cousin, things would have to be managed differently. I wouldn't passively accept being the one who always gives way; I would insist you do your share of the work and make sure it was done, or it would simply remain unfinished. I would also require you to keep some of those drawn-out, somewhat insincere complaints to yourself. It's only because our time together is so brief and occurs during such a sad period that I am willing to be so patient and accommodating on my part.' Finally, I saw Georgiana off. However, then it was Eliza's turn to ask me to stay for another week. She claimed her upcoming plans required all her time and concentration. She was preparing to leave for some unknown destination and spent all day in her room with the door bolted, filling trunks, emptying drawers, burning papers, and avoiding contact with everyone. She needed me to manage the household, greet visitors, and respond to sympathy notes. One morning, she informed me I was free to go. She added, 'And I am grateful for your valuable assistance and sensible behavior! There is a noticeable difference between living with someone like you and someone like Georgiana; you handle your own responsibilities and are not a burden. Tomorrow,' she continued, 'I am traveling to the Continent. I will reside in a religious community near Lille—what you would call a nunnery. There I will find peace and quiet. I plan to dedicate some time to examining Roman Catholic doctrines and thoroughly studying how their system operates. If I conclude, as I partly suspect, that it is the best way to ensure everything is done properly and orderly, I will adopt the Roman Catholic faith and likely become a nun.' I showed no surprise at this decision and made no attempt to talk her out of it. 'That calling is absolutely perfect for you,' I thought, 'and I hope it brings you whatever good you seek!' When we said goodbye, she remarked, 'Farewell, cousin Jane Eyre; I wish you well. You possess some sense.' I replied, 'You are not without sense either, cousin Eliza, but I expect whatever sense you have will be effectively buried alive in a French convent within another year. However, it's not my concern, and as long as it suits you, I don't much care.' 'You are right,' she said, and with those words, we parted ways. As I won't need to mention either her or her sister again, I might as well state here that Georgiana made a beneficial marriage to a wealthy man of fashion who was past his prime, and Eliza did indeed take the veil. To this day, she is the superior of the convent where she completed her initial training, a convent she also provided with her financial means.",

Georgiana admitted she feared being left alone with Eliza, who offered her no comfort in her sadness, no support, nor any help in getting ready. So I tolerated her complaints and self-pity as best I could, helping with her sewing and packing. Admittedly, she didn't help much herself, and I thought, \"If we had to live together long-term, things would have to change—I wouldn't be so patient or forgiving; I'd make sure she did her share of the work and didn't whine so much. But since our time together is brief and it's a sad occasion, I'm willing to put up with it for now.\" Eventually, I saw Georgiana off, but then Eliza asked me to stay another week while she made her own preparations to leave for a mysterious destination, spending her days alone, sorting her belongings and keeping to herself. She asked me to manage the house, receive visitors, and address letters of condolence.\n\nOne morning, Eliza told me I was free to go, thanking me for my help and noting the difference between living with me and Georgiana; I was independent and didn't trouble others. She said she was leaving for the Continent the following day to live in a religious house near Lisle—a nunnery—and intended to study Catholic doctrines, possibly even becoming a nun if she found the system worthy.\n\nI neither objected nor showed surprise, thinking the life would suit her perfectly. When we parted, she wished me well, acknowledging my sense, and I replied that she too had sense, though soon it would likely be cloistered away in a French convent. We agreed this was her choice and parted ways. Since I won't mention them again, I should note that Georgiana married a rich but jaded man of fashion, while Eliza did indeed become a nun and eventually the head of the convent, to which she gave her inheritance."

Neither of these returnings was very pleasant or desirable: no magnet drew me to a given point, increasing in its strength of attraction the nearer I came. The return to Thornfield was yet to be tried.\nMy journey seemed tedious—very tedious: fifty miles one day, a night spent at an inn; fifty miles the next day.

I mused on the funeral day, the coffin, the hearse, the black train of tenants and servants—few was the number of relatives—the gaping vault, the silent church, the solemn service.

My return to Thornfield was a new experience I had yet to undergo. My journey felt long and tiresome—a hundred miles covered over two days, with an overnight stop at an inn in between. For the first twelve hours, my thoughts were occupied with Mrs. Reed's final moments; I pictured her distorted and discolored face and heard her voice, so strangely altered. I contemplated the funeral day, the coffin, the hearse, the small procession of tenants and servants (with only a few relatives), the open grave, the quiet church, and the serious service. Then, I thought of Eliza and Georgiana; I imagined one as the life of a party and the other living in seclusion in a convent cell, and I pondered and analyzed their distinct physical appearances and personalities.

These affirmed that it was pleasure enough to have the privilege of again looking on Mr. Rochester, whether he looked on me or not; and they added—“Hasten! hasten! be with him while you may: but a few more days or weeks, at most, and you are parted from him for ever!” And then I strangled a new-born agony—a deformed thing which I could not persuade myself to own and rear—and ran on.\nThey are making hay, too, in Thornfield meadows: or rather, the labourers are just quitting their work, and returning home with their rakes on their shoulders, now, at the hour I arrive. I have but a field or two to traverse, and then I shall cross the road and reach the gates. How full the hedges are of roses! But I have no time to gather any; I want to be at the house. I passed a tall briar, shooting leafy and flowery branches across the path; I see the narrow stile with stone steps; and I see—Mr. Rochester sitting there, a book and a pencil in his hand; he is writing.",
          "paraphrase_gemini-2.5-flash-preview-04-17": "I opted to walk the distance back alone at a calm pace. After leaving my luggage under the ostler’s supervision, I slipped away from the George Inn quite unobtrusively around six o'clock on a June evening and took the old path towards Thornfield. This route primarily traversed fields and was not heavily used at the time. It wasn't a particularly bright or magnificent summer evening, though it was pleasant and gentle. Haymakers were actively working alongside the road, and the sky, while not entirely clear, looked promising for the weather ahead. Its blue, where visible, was soft and settled, and the cloud layers were high and thin. The western horizon felt warm; no watery glint cooled it. It appeared as if a fire was burning, or an altar alight behind its screen of marbled clouds, with a golden-red light shining through openings. I felt happy as the journey shortened before me – so happy that I paused once to question the source of this joy and remind my rational mind that I was not returning to my actual home, a permanent dwelling, or a place where beloved friends awaited my arrival. 'Certainly, Mrs. Fairfax will greet you with a composed welcome,' I told myself, 'and little Adèle will clap her hands and jump excitedly to see you, but you know perfectly well your thoughts are focused on someone other than them, and he is not thinking of you.' But what is more impulsive than youth? What is more ignorant than lack of experience? These parts of me insisted that simply having the opportunity to see Mr. Rochester again was sufficient pleasure, regardless of whether he noticed me. They urged, 'Hurry! Hurry! Be with him while you still can; in just a few more days or weeks, at most, you will be separated from him permanently!' And then I stifled a burgeoning pain – a twisted feeling I couldn't bring myself to acknowledge or accept – and ran on. They are also making hay in the meadows at Thornfield, or rather, the workers are just finishing their labor and heading home with their rakes over their shoulders, precisely at the hour I arrive. I only have one or two fields left to cross before I reach the road and the gates. The hedges are overflowing with roses! But I don't have time to pick any; I am eager to reach the house. I passed a tall wild rose bush that stretched its leafy, blooming branches across the path. I see the narrow stile with stone steps, and there I see – Mr. Rochester sitting there with a book and a pencil in his hand. He is writing.",
          "paraphrase_gpt-4.1-2025-04-14": "I decided to make the walk on my own in peace; so, after giving my box to the ostler for safekeeping, I quietly left the George Inn at around six in the evening on a June day and took the old road to Thornfield. This road went mostly through fields and was now rarely used. The evening was gentle and pleasant, though not particularly bright or spectacular; haymakers were busy along the route. The sky, though not completely clear, looked promising for the coming days; where it was blue, the color was soft and calm, and the clouds were high and thin. In the west, there was a comforting warmth, with no cold gleam dulling it—it looked as if a fire was glowing behind the marbled clouds, with golden-red light shining through. As I drew nearer to my destination, my happiness grew, and I paused for a moment to question and remind myself that I was not heading home, nor to a place of lasting welcome or loving friends. 'Mrs. Fairfax will receive you kindly,' I told myself, 'and little Adèle will be excited to see you; but you know who you are really thinking of, and he is not thinking of you.' Still, what could be more reckless than youth or as unaware as inexperience? These feelings insisted that just being able to see Mr. Rochester again was joy enough, whether or not he noticed me; and they urged me, 'Hurry! Make the most of your time with him, for it will not last. Soon, you’ll be separated from him forever.' With that, I forced down a pain I could not bear to acknowledge and hurried onward. The haymaking was ending at Thornfield as well; the workers were leaving, carrying their rakes home as I arrived. I had only a couple more fields to go before crossing the road to the gates. The hedges overflowed with roses, but I had no time to pick any; I was eager to reach the house. I passed a tall bramble stretching leafy, blossoming boughs across my path; then I saw the narrow stone stile, and there was Mr. Rochester, sitting with a book and pencil in hand, writing."

I know another way to the house. It does not signify if I knew twenty ways; for he has seen me.\n“Hillo!” he cries; and he puts up his book and his pencil. “There you are! Come on, if you please.”\nI suppose I do come on; though in what fashion I know not; being scarcely cognisant of my movements, and solicitous only to appear calm; and, above all, to control the working muscles of my face—which I feel rebel insolently against my will, and struggle to express what I had resolved to conceal. But I have a veil—it is down: I may make shift yet to behave with decent composure.\n“And this is Jane Eyre? Are you coming from Millcote, and on foot? Yes—just one of your tricks: not to send for a carriage, and come clattering over street and road like a common mortal, but to steal into the vicinage of your home along with twilight, just as if you were a dream or a shade. What the deuce have you done with yourself this last month?”\n“I have been with my aunt, sir, who is dead.”\n“A true Janian reply! Good angels be my guard! She comes from the other world—from the abode of people who are dead; and tells me so when she meets me alone here in the gloaming! If I dared, I’d touch you, to see if you are substance or shadow, you elf!—but I’d as soon offer to take hold of a blue ignis fatuus light in a marsh. Truant! truant!” he added, when he had paused an instant. “Absent from me a whole month, and forgetting me quite, I’ll be sworn!”\nI knew there would be pleasure in meeting my master again, even though broken by the fear that he was so soon to cease to be my master, and by the knowledge that I was nothing to him: but there was ever in Mr. Rochester (so at least I thought) such a wealth of the power of communicating happiness, that to taste but of the crumbs he scattered to stray and stranger birds like me, was to feast genially. His last words were balm: they seemed to imply that it imported something to him whether I forgot him or not. And he had spoken of Thornfield as my home—would that it were my home!\nHe did not leave the stile, and I hardly liked to ask to go by. I inquired soon if he had not been to London.\n“Yes; I suppose you found that out by second-sight.”\n“Mrs. Fairfax told me in a letter.”\n“And did she inform you what I went to do?”\n“Oh, yes, sir! Everybody knew your errand.”\n“You must see the carriage, Jane, and tell me if you don’t think it will suit Mrs. Rochester exactly; and whether she won’t look like Queen Boadicea, leaning back against those purple cushions. I wish, Jane, I were a trifle better adapted to match with her externally. Tell me now, fairy as you are—can’t you give me a charm, or a philter, or something of that sort, to make me a handsome man?”\n“It would be past the power of magic, sir;” and, in thought, I added, “A loving eye is all the charm needed: to such you are handsome enough; or rather your sternness has a power beyond beauty.”\nMr. Rochester had sometimes read my unspoken thoughts with an acumen to me incomprehensible: in the present instance he took no notice of my abrupt vocal response; but he smiled at me with a certain smile he had of his own, and which he used but on rare occasions. He seemed to think it too good for common purposes: it was the real sunshine of feeling—he shed it over me now.\n“Pass, Janet,” said he, making room for me to cross the stile: “go up home, and stay your weary little wandering feet at a friend’s threshold.”\nAll I had now to do was to obey him in silence: no need for me to colloquise further. I got over the stile without a word, and meant to leave him calmly. An impulse held me fast—a force turned me round. I said—or something in me said for me, and in spite of me—\n“Thank you, Mr. Rochester, for your great kindness. I am strangely glad to get back again to you: and wherever you are is my home—my only home.”\nI walked on so fast that even he could hardly have overtaken me had he tried.",
          "paraphrase_gemini-2.5-flash-preview-04-17": "Okay, he's not a ghost, yet every nerve I have is tense and trembling; for a moment, I can't control myself. What is happening? I didn't expect to shake like this when I saw him, or lose my voice and ability to move when he was near. I'll go back as soon as I can manage to stir. I don't need to make a complete fool of myself. I know a different route to the house. But it doesn't matter if I knew twenty routes, because he has seen me.\n\n\"Hello!\" he shouts, putting away his book and pencil. \"There you are! Come here, please.\"\n\nI suppose I do walk towards him, though I'm not sure how; I'm barely aware of my movements, only focused on appearing calm and, most of all, controlling my facial muscles – which feel like they're insolently fighting against my will, struggling to show what I was determined to hide. But I have a veil pulled down, so maybe I can still manage to act with some decent composure.\n\n\"And you are Jane Eyre? Are you arriving from Millcote, and on foot? Yes, typical of your ways – not asking for a carriage and making a lot of noise coming through town and country like everyone else, but sneaking into the area near your home as dusk falls, just as if you were a dream or a spirit. What on earth have you been doing with yourself this past month?\"\n\n\"I have been with my aunt, sir, who has passed away.\"\n\n\"A truly Jane-like answer! May good angels protect me! She comes from the other world – from where dead people reside – and tells me this when she meets me alone here in the twilight! If I dared, I'd touch you to see if you are real or just a shade, you little sprite! – but I'd sooner try to grab a glowing blue marsh gas light in a bog. Runaway! Runaway!\" he added after a brief pause. \"Away from me for a whole month, and completely forgetting me, I'm sure!\"\n\nI knew there would be happiness in seeing my employer again, even though it was overshadowed by the fear that he would soon no longer be my employer, and by the knowledge that I meant nothing important to him. But Mr. Rochester always seemed to possess (at least I thought so) such a great ability to spread happiness, that to experience even the tiny bits he gave to stray, unfamiliar people like me felt like a truly enjoyable feast. His last words were comforting; they seemed to suggest that it mattered to him whether I forgot him or not. And he had referred to Thornfield as my home – I desperately wished it were my home!\n\nHe remained by the stone steps, and I felt awkward asking to pass. I soon asked if he hadn't been to London.\n\n\"Yes; I assume you figured that out using second-sight.\"\n\n\"Mrs. Fairfax mentioned it in a letter.\"\n\n\"And did she tell you why I went?\"\n\n\"Oh, yes, sir! Everyone knew why you were going.\"\n\n\"You must see the carriage, Jane, and tell me if you don't think it will be perfect for Mrs. Rochester; and whether she won't look like Queen Boadicea leaning back against those purple cushions. I wish, Jane, that I were slightly better looking to match her appearance. Tell me now, you fairy-like creature – can't you give me a charm, or a potion, or something similar to make me a handsome man?\"\n\n\"That would be beyond the power of magic, sir;\" and, to myself, I added, \"A loving gaze is all the magic needed: to someone who loves you, you are handsome enough; or rather, your sternness has a power that surpasses beauty.\"\n\nMr. Rochester had sometimes understood my unspoken thoughts with a perception that I couldn't understand. In this instance, he didn't react to my sudden spoken reply, but he smiled at me with a unique smile of his own, one he used only on rare occasions. He seemed to consider it too precious for everyday use; it was the genuine warmth of emotion, and he directed it towards me then.\n\n\"Pass, Janet,\" he said, moving aside to let me cross the steps. \"Go on home, and rest your tired little wandering feet at a friend's entrance.\"\n\nAll I had to do then was obey him in silence; there was no need for me to talk any further. I climbed over the steps without a word, intending to leave him calmly. An impulse held me still – a force turned me around. I said – or something inside me said for me, against my will –\n\n\"Thank you, Mr. Rochester, for your great kindness. I am strangely happy to be back with you again; and wherever you are is my home – my only home.\"\n\nI walked away so quickly that even he would have found it difficult to catch me if he had tried.",
          "paraphrase_gpt-4.1-2025-04-14": "Although he isn't a ghost, seeing him leaves me feeling nervous and almost unable to control myself for a moment. Why do I feel this way? I didn't expect to physically tremble, lose my voice, or be unable to move just because I saw him. As soon as I can, I'll go back—there's no need to look utterly foolish. I know another way to return to the house, but it doesn't matter, since he has already noticed me.\n\nHe calls, 'Hillo!' and puts his book and pencil away. 'There you are! Come here, if you please.'\n\nI approach him, though I don't really know how I'm moving, only that I'm anxious to seem calm and especially to keep my face from revealing my true feelings—though the effort is difficult. Luckily, I'm veiled, so I might just manage to act with composure.\n\n'And this is Jane Eyre? Have you come from Millcote, and all on foot? Trust you to do that—never sending for a carriage and arriving loudly like others, but sneaking quietly home with the twilight, like some specter or spirit. What have you been up to for the last month?'\n\n'I was with my aunt, sir—she has died.'\n\n'A typical Jane reply! Angels protect me! You come from the world of the dead, and inform me so here in the dusk! If I dared, I’d touch you to see if you're flesh or phantom, you elf! I might as well try grasping swamp lights. Truant! Gone for a whole month, forgetting me—I’m sure of it!'\n\nI had anticipated it would be a pleasure to see Mr. Rochester again, though I was anxious over the thought that he would soon no longer be my employer, and that I meant nothing to him. Still, Mr. Rochester, I thought, had a remarkable ability to give happiness, and receiving just a little of his kindness felt like a feast. His last words were comforting; they hinted that it mattered to him whether or not I had forgotten him. He even called Thornfield my home—how I wish it truly were!\n\nHe remained at the stile, so I didn't like to ask to get by. I asked instead whether he had been to London.\n\n'Yes; you must have guessed that with your second sight.'\n\n'Mrs. Fairfax told me in a letter.'\n\n'And did she tell you why I went?'\n\n'Oh yes, sir. Everyone knew your purpose.'\n\n'You must look at the carriage, Jane, and tell me if it won't be perfect for Mrs. Rochester. Won't she look like Queen Boadicea on those purple cushions? I wish I looked a little better beside her. Tell me, fairy, can’t you conjure some potion or spell to make me handsome?'\n\n'No magic could do that, sir.' I thought, 'A loving gaze is the only charm needed; to them, you’re handsome enough—your fierceness is more powerful than beauty.'\n\nMr. Rochester often seemed to sense my unspoken thoughts, but this time he only smiled at me with that rare, special smile—sunshine from his heart that he seldom shared, but now bestowed on me.\n\n'Go ahead, Janet,' he said, making space for me to cross the stile. 'Go home and rest your tired feet at a friend’s door.'\n\nI obeyed silently—there was no need to say more. I crossed the stile and intended to leave quietly, but something compelled me to turn and say, 'Thank you, Mr. Rochester, for all your kindness. I’m truly glad to be back with you, and wherever you are is my only home.'\n\nI hurried away so quickly that he could hardly have caught up even if he’d tried."

          "text_segment": "A fortnight of dubious calm succeeded my return to Thornfield Hall. Nothing was said of the master’s marriage, and I saw no preparation going on for such an event. Almost every day I asked Mrs. Fairfax if she had yet heard anything decided: her answer was always in the negative. Once she said she had actually put the question to Mr. Rochester as to when he was going to bring his bride home; but he had answered her only by a joke and one of his queer looks, and she could not tell what to make of him.\nOne thing specially surprised me, and that was, there were no journeyings backward and forward, no visits to Ingram Park: to be sure it was twenty miles off, on the borders of another county; but what was that distance to an ardent lover? To so practised and indefatigable a horseman as Mr. Rochester, it would be but a morning’s ride. I began to cherish hopes I had no right to conceive: that the match was broken off; that rumour had been mistaken; that one or both parties had changed their minds. I used to look at my master’s face to see if it were sad or fierce; but I could not remember the time when it had been so uniformly clear of clouds or evil feelings. If, in the moments I and my pupil spent with him, I lacked spirits and sank into inevitable dejection, he became even gay. Never had he called me more frequently to his presence; never been kinder to me when there—and, alas! never had I loved him so well.",
          "paraphrase_gemini-2.5-flash-preview-04-17": "Following my return to Thornfield Hall, a period of two weeks unfolded with an uncertain tranquility. There was no discussion about the master's impending marriage, nor did I observe any preparations being made for such an event. Almost daily, I inquired of Mrs. Fairfax whether she had received any definitive news; her response was invariably negative. On one occasion, she mentioned having directly asked Mr. Rochester when he planned to bring his bride home, but he had only replied with a joke and one of his peculiar looks, leaving her bewildered. One particular point of surprise for me was the complete absence of travel back and forth, no visits to Ingram Park. While it was twenty miles away, located on the border of another county, such a distance would typically mean little to an impassioned lover. For an accomplished and tireless horseman like Mr. Rochester, it was merely a morning's ride. I began to harbor hopes I knew I had no right to entertain: perhaps the engagement had been called off, the rumors were inaccurate, or one or both individuals had reconsidered. I frequently studied my master's face, searching for signs of sadness or fierceness, but I couldn't recall a time when his expression had been so consistently free from gloom or ill temper. During the times my pupil and I spent with him, if I felt low-spirited and succumbed to unavoidable melancholy, he would become remarkably cheerful. He summoned me to his presence more often than ever before, was exceptionally kind to me when I was there—and tragically, my affection for him had never been stronger.",

Nearly every day I asked Mrs. Fairfax if there was any news or decisions, but she always replied no. She once told me she had asked Mr. Rochester directly when he would bring his bride home, but he only replied with a joke and one of his strange looks, leaving her puzzled. I found it especially odd that there were no trips to or from Ingram Park—although it was twenty miles away in another county, the distance would be nothing for a devoted lover or someone like Mr. Rochester who was skilled and tireless on horseback. These circumstances led me to secretly hope—though I knew I shouldn't—that the engagement was off, that the gossip had been wrong, or that someone had changed their mind. I watched Mr. Rochester's expression for signs of sadness or anger, but I couldn't recall a time when he had seemed so consistently calm and free of dark moods. If, during the time I spent with him and my pupil, I felt low or despondent, he seemed all the more cheerful. He had never called me to see him more often, nor treated me with such kindness—and, sadly, I had never loved him more."

It was as if a band of Italian days had come from the South, like a flock of glorious passenger birds, and lighted to rest them on the cliffs of Albion. The hay was all got in; the fields round Thornfield were green and shorn; the roads white and baked; the trees were in their dark prime; hedge and wood, full-leaved and deeply tinted, contrasted well with the sunny hue of the cleared meadows between.\nOn Midsummer-eve, Adèle, weary with gathering wild strawberries in Hay Lane half the day, had gone to bed with the sun. I watched her drop asleep, and when I left her, I sought the garden.\nIt was now the sweetest hour of the twenty-four:—“Day its fervid fires had wasted,” and dew fell cool on panting plain and scorched summit. Where the sun had gone down in simple state—pure of the pomp of clouds—spread a solemn purple, burning with the light of red jewel and furnace flame at one point, on one hill-peak, and extending high and wide, soft and still softer, over half heaven. The east had its own charm or fine deep blue, and its own modest gem, a rising and solitary star: soon it would boast the moon; but she was yet beneath the horizon.\nI walked a while on the pavement; but a subtle, well-known scent—that of a cigar—stole from some window; I saw the library casement open a handbreadth; I knew I might be watched thence; so I went apart into the orchard. No nook in the grounds more sheltered and more Eden-like; it was full of trees, it bloomed with flowers: a very high wall shut it out from the court, on one side; on the other, a beech avenue screened it from the lawn. At the bottom was a sunk fence; its sole separation from lonely fields: a winding walk, bordered with laurels and terminating in a giant horse-chestnut, circled at the base by a seat, led down to the fence. Here one could wander unseen.",
          "paraphrase_gemini-2.5-flash-preview-04-17": "A magnificent Midsummer graced England: skies so clear and suns so bright as were seen in a long series rarely bless our island nation, even individually. It was as if a group of Italian days had traveled from the south, like a flock of beautiful migratory birds, and settled to rest on England's cliffs. The hay had all been harvested; the fields surrounding Thornfield were green and neatly mown; the roads were white and dried by the sun; the trees were in their full, dark foliage; the hedges and woods, dense with leaves and deeply colored, provided a pleasant contrast to the bright, sunny hue of the cleared fields between them. On the evening of Midsummer, Adèle, fatigued from picking wild strawberries in Hay Lane for half the day, had gone to bed with the setting sun. I watched her fall asleep, and after leaving her, I made my way to the garden. This was now the most delightful hour of the twenty-four: 'Day had exhausted its intense heat,' and cool dew settled on the thirsty ground and dried hilltops. Where the sun had set plainly, without the grandeur of clouds, a solemn purple color spread, glowing like a red jewel or furnace fire at one spot, on a single hill-peak, and extending high and wide, becoming softer and softer over half the sky. The east had its own charm in a lovely deep blue, and its own modest gem, a rising and solitary star; the moon would soon be visible, but it was not yet above the horizon. I walked for a while on the paved path; but a subtle, familiar scent—that of a cigar—drifted from a window; I saw the library window open just a handbreadth; I knew I might be observed from there; so I moved away into the orchard. No other place on the grounds was as secluded and as like paradise; it was filled with trees and blooming with flowers: a very tall wall separated it from the courtyard on one side; on the other, a line of beech trees screened it from the lawn. At the lower edge was a ha-ha (sunk fence), its only boundary from the isolated fields beyond: a winding path, lined with laurel bushes and ending at a giant horse-chestnut tree with a seat around its base, led down to the fence. Here, one could walk unseen.",
          "paraphrase_gpt-4.1-2025-04-14": "A glorious midsummer covered England, with days of clear skies and shining sun following one after another—weather rarely experienced, even occasionally, in this island nation. It felt as if a string of Italian days had flown up from the south, like beautiful migrating birds, and come to rest along England’s shore. All the hay had already been harvested; the fields around Thornfield were green and trimmed; the roads were pale and dry; the trees were thick with leaves, and both hedges and woods were deep in color, beautifully contrasting with the golden, sunny meadows in between.\n\nOn Midsummer Eve, Adèle, tired from spending much of the day picking wild strawberries along Hay Lane, had gone to bed with the sunset. I stayed with her until she fell asleep, and then I made my way to the garden.\n\nThat was the most pleasant moment of the day: the heat of the afternoon had faded, and a cool dew descended over the overheated land. In the west, the sun had set simply and grandly, without dramatic clouds—leaving a deep purple glow, flickering with the red of jewels and fiery light at one point on a distant hillside, spreading gently upwards across much of the sky. To the east, the sky was a rich, deep blue, showcasing a lone, rising star—a modest gem that would soon be joined by the moon, still hidden below the horizon.\n\nI strolled along the path for a time, but then I caught a familiar scent of cigar drifting out from a slightly opened library window—I realized I could be observed from there. So I moved away into the orchard, the most hidden and idyllic spot on the grounds, filled with trees and blossoming flowers. A tall wall shielded it from the courtyard on one side, while a beech-lined avenue separated it from the lawn on the other. At the far end was a sunken fence, the only barrier from the open fields—a winding walkway flanked by laurels led down to a huge horse-chestnut tree encircled by a seat. Here, one could walk in solitude, away from being seen."

However, as I walked through the flower and fruit beds in the garden's upper area, drawn there by the light the newly risen moon cast upon this more open section, my movement stopped—not due to a sound or sight, but once again because of a distinct scent that served as a warning. Sweet-briar, southernwood, jasmine, pinks, and roses had already been releasing their evening perfumes for a while; this new smell, however, was not from a plant. It was—and I recognized it instantly—Mr. Rochester's cigar. I looked around and listened intently. I saw trees heavy with ripening fruit. I heard a nightingale singing in woods roughly half a mile away. No person was visible, and no footsteps were audible, but the fragrance intensified, making me feel I had to escape. I headed towards the small gate leading to the shrubbery and saw Mr. Rochester entering. I quickly stepped aside into the area hidden by ivy. He wouldn't stay long, I thought; he would soon return the way he came, and if I kept still, he would never notice me. But no, he found the evening just as pleasant and this old garden just as appealing as I did. He continued his stroll, at one point lifting the branches of a gooseberry bush to examine the fruit, which was as large as plums because the branches were so heavily laden. Then he picked a ripe cherry from the wall. Next, he bent down towards a cluster of flowers, either to inhale their fragrance or admire the dew drops on their petals. A large moth buzzed past me and landed on a plant near Mr. Rochester's feet. He saw it and leaned down to examine it closely.",

The sweet fragrances of sweet-briar, southernwood, jasmine, pinks, and roses had long filled the air, but this aroma was different—not from any blossom or shrub; I recognized it as Mr. Rochester's cigar smoke. I looked and listened: fruit-heavy trees surrounded me, a nightingale sang in the distant woods, but I saw no one and heard no footsteps—yet the scent grew stronger. I felt compelled to leave and headed for the shrubbery gate, just as I saw Mr. Rochester arriving. I hid in an ivy-covered nook, reasoning he wouldn't stay long and I could avoid being seen by sitting still. Yet rather than leaving, he lingered, evidently enjoying the evening and the old garden as much as I did. He wandered about, examining the gooseberry branches heavy with fruit, picking a ripe cherry from a wall, and bending towards a cluster of flowers, perhaps to inhale their scent or admire the dew on their petals. Suddenly, a large moth buzzed by me, landing on a plant near Mr. Rochester; he noticed and bent to observe it."

As I crossed his long shadow, cast across the garden by the moon that hadn't yet climbed high, he spoke quietly, without turning around—“Jane, approach and examine this creature.” I had made no noise; he lacked eyes in the back of his head—could his shadow detect me? I was taken aback at first, but then I drew nearer to him. “Observe its wings,” he said, “it reminds me somewhat of an insect from the West Indies; one doesn't frequently see such a large and colorful night-flying creature in England. Look! It has flown.” The moth departed. I was also hesitantly retreating; but Mr. Rochester followed me, and when we arrived at the gate, he instructed—“Return; it’s a pity to stay inside on such a beautiful night; and surely nobody would want to retire while sunset is meeting with moonrise in this manner.” It is a flaw of mine that although my speech is sometimes quick with a response, at other times it completely fails me when I need to form an excuse; and this lapse always occurs at a crucial moment, when a simple word or believable reason is particularly required to free me from awkward discomfort.

Startled, I approached him. He showed me the moth and compared it to a tropical insect, saying it was rare to see such a big, colorful night moth in England, and then it flew away.

I'll ignore the perceived insult to my beloved's character in that suggestion; truly, when you are far away, Janet, I'll try to forget it: I will focus only on its wisdom; which is so great that I have decided to act upon it.

I consider that when a dependent does her duty as well as you have done yours, she has a sort of claim upon her employer for any little assistance he can conveniently render her; indeed I have already, through my future mother-in-law, heard of a place that I think will suit: it is to undertake the education of the five daughters of Mrs. Dionysius O’Gall of Bitternutt Lodge, Connaught, Ireland. You’ll like Ireland, I think: they’re such warm-hearted people there, they say.”\n“It is a long way off, sir.”\n“No matter—a girl of your sense will not object to the voyage or the distance.”\n“Not the voyage, but the distance: and then the sea is a barrier—”\n“From what, Jane?”\n“From England and from Thornfield: and—”\n“Well?”\n“From you, sir.”\nI said this almost involuntarily, and, with as little sanction of free will, my tears gushed out. I did not cry so as to be heard, however; I avoided sobbing. The thought of Mrs. O’Gall and Bitternutt Lodge struck cold to my heart; and colder the thought of all the brine and foam, destined, as it seemed, to rush between me and the master at whose side I now walked, and coldest the remembrance of the wider ocean—wealth, caste, custom intervened between me and what I naturally and inevitably loved.\n“It is a long way,” I again said.\n“It is, to be sure; and when you get to Bitternutt Lodge, Connaught, Ireland, I shall never see you again, Jane: that’s morally certain. I never go over to Ireland, not having myself much of a fancy for the country. We have been good friends, Jane; have we not?”\n“Yes, sir.”\n“And when friends are on the eve of separation, they like to spend the little time that remains to them close to each other. Come! we’ll talk over the voyage and the parting quietly half-an-hour or so, while the stars enter into their shining life up in heaven yonder: here is the chestnut tree: here is the bench at its old roots. Come, we will sit there in peace to-night, though we should never more be destined to sit there together.” He seated me and himself.\n“It is a long way to Ireland, Janet, and I am sorry to send my little friend on such weary travels: but if I can’t do better, how is it to be helped? Are you anything akin to me, do you think, Jane?”\nI could risk no sort of answer by this time: my heart was still.\n“Because,” he said, “I sometimes have a queer feeling with regard to you—especially when you are near me, as now: it is as if I had a string somewhere under my left ribs, tightly and inextricably knotted to a similar string situated in the corresponding quarter of your little frame. And if that boisterous Channel, and two hundred miles or so of land come broad between us, I am afraid that cord of communion will be snapt; and then I’ve a nervous notion I should take to bleeding inwardly. As for you,—you’d forget me.”\n“That I never should, sir: you know—” Impossible to proceed.",
          "paraphrase_gemini-2.5-flash-preview-04-17": "I agreed immediately, sir, promising to advertise and then hesitating, ready to ask if I might remain there until I found new accommodation, but stopping myself as my voice was unsteady and I didn't want to risk speaking a long sentence. Mr. Rochester continued, saying, \"I expect to be married in about a month, and in the meantime, I will personally search for a job and a place for you.\" I replied, \"Thank you, sir; I regret causing trouble—\" He interrupted, \"Oh, there's no need to apologize! I believe that when a dependent fulfills her duties as capably as you have, she is entitled to a degree of assistance from her employer that he can reasonably provide. In fact, I've already learned of a position I think will be suitable, through my future mother-in-law: it involves educating the five daughters of Mrs. Dionysius O’Gall at Bitternutt Lodge, Connaught, Ireland. I suspect you will enjoy Ireland; they say the people there are very warm-hearted.\" I responded, \"It is a considerable distance, sir.\" He countered, \"That doesn't matter—someone as sensible as you won't mind the journey or the distance.\" I clarified, \"Not the journey, but the distance; and then the sea is a separation—\" He asked, \"From what, Jane?\" I listed, \"From England and from Thornfield; and—\" He prompted, \"Go on?\" I finished, \"From you, sir.\" This slipped out almost without my control, and just as involuntarily, tears welled up. However, I cried silently, avoiding any sobbing. The prospect of Mrs. O’Gall and Bitternutt Lodge sent a chill through me; the thought of the vast expanse of sea and waves, destined it seemed to come between me and the master I now walked beside, was even colder; and the coldest realization was the barrier of the wider ocean—wealth, social class, and convention—that stood between me and what I naturally and inevitably loved. \"It is a long way,\" I repeated. \"It is, indeed,\" he confirmed, \"and once you are at Bitternutt Lodge, Connaught, Ireland, I will certainly never see you again, Jane: that's morally certain. I never travel to Ireland myself, as I don't particularly care for the country. We have been good friends, Jane, haven't we?\" \"Yes, sir,\" I replied. \"And when friends are about to separate,\" he continued, \"they like to spend the little time they have left close to each other. Come! We'll talk about the journey and the parting quietly for about half an hour, while the stars begin their glittering existence in the heavens. Here is the chestnut tree; here is the bench by its ancient roots. Come, we will sit there peacefully tonight, even if we are never meant to sit there together again.\" He sat us both down. \"It is a great distance to Ireland, Janet, and I am sorry to send my little friend on such tiring travels, but if I cannot find a better option, what else can be done? Do you feel any connection to me, do you think, Jane?\" By this point, my heart was too overwhelmed for me to risk any kind of answer. \"Because,\" he explained, \"I sometimes experience a strange sensation concerning you—especially when you are near me, as you are now. It is as though I have a string somewhere beneath my left ribs, tied tightly and inseparably to a similar string located in the corresponding part of your small body. And if that rough Channel and two hundred miles or so of land come between us, I fear that thread of connection will snap, and then I have a nervous idea that I would begin bleeding internally. As for you, you would forget me.\" \"That I never should, sir: you know—\" I found it impossible to continue.",

When someone in your position has worked as well as you have, I believe they deserve any support their employer can reasonably offer. In fact, through my future mother-in-law, I've already found a potential job for you: teaching the five daughters of Mrs. Dionysius O’Gall at Bitternutt Lodge, in Connaught, Ireland. I'm sure you’ll enjoy Ireland; the people are said to be very warm and friendly.\"\n\n\"That's very far away, sir.\"\n\n\"It doesn't matter—someone as sensible as you won't be put off by the journey or the distance.\"\n\n\"It’s not the travel itself, but the separation—and the sea forms such a barrier—\"\n\n\"Between what, Jane?\"\n\n\"Between England and Thornfield, and—\"\n\n\"And?\"\n\n\"Between you, sir.\"\n\nThese words escaped from me before I could control them, and suddenly I was in tears, though I tried to contain them so he wouldn’t hear. The thought of Mrs. O’Gall’s home chilled me; worse still was the thought of the sea that would separate me from Mr. Rochester, and most painful was remembering all the social divisions—wealth, class, tradition—that truly stood between me and the person I cared for most.\n\n\"It is a long way,\" I repeated.\n\n\"It certainly is, and once you get to Bitternutt Lodge in Ireland, I will likely never see you again, Jane. That much is certain: Ireland is not a place I visit, as I don't particularly care for it. We've been good friends, haven't we, Jane?\"\n\n\"Yes, sir.\"\n\n\"And when close friends are about to part, they want to spend whatever time remains together. Come—let’s quietly talk about your journey and our farewell for half an hour or so, while the stars come out above us. Here is the chestnut tree and the same old bench. Let's sit down there for one last peaceful evening, even if we are never to sit together again.\" He led me to the seat and joined me.\n\n\"It is a long journey to Ireland, Janet, and it saddens me to send my dear friend so far away; but if there’s nothing better I can do, what choice do I have? Jane, do you feel any sort of connection to me?\"\n\nBy then, I couldn’t say a word; my heart was heavy.\n\n\"Because,\" he explained, \"sometimes when you’re close to me, like now, I have a strange feeling—as if there's an invisible string tied tightly from somewhere beneath my left ribs to a matching place in you. And if the wild sea and all those miles come between us, I’m afraid that thread would break, and I would suffer inside. As for you—you’d forget me.\"\n\n\"I never would, sir; you know—\" But I couldn’t finish."

I have not been trampled on. I have not been petrified. I have not been buried with inferior minds, and excluded from every glimpse of communion with what is bright and energetic and high. I have talked, face to face, with what I reverence, with what I delight in,—with an original, a vigorous, an expanded mind.

I see the necessity of departure; and it is like looking on the necessity of death.”\n“Where do you see the necessity?” he asked suddenly.\n“Where? You, sir, have placed it before me.”\n“In what shape?”\n“In the shape of Miss Ingram; a noble and beautiful woman,—your bride.”\n“My bride! What bride? I have no bride!”\n“But you will have.”\n“Yes;—I will!—I will!” He set his teeth.\n“Then I must go:—you have said it yourself.”\n“No: you must stay! I swear it—and the oath shall be kept.”\n“I tell you I must go!” I retorted, roused to something like passion. “Do you think I can stay to become nothing to you? Do you think I am an automaton?—a machine without feelings? and can bear to have my morsel of bread snatched from my lips, and my drop of living water dashed from my cup? Do you think, because I am poor, obscure, plain, and little, I am soulless and heartless? You think wrong!—I have as much soul as you,—and full as much heart! And if God had gifted me with some beauty and much wealth, I should have made it as hard for you to leave me, as it is now for me to leave you. I am not talking to you now through the medium of custom, conventionalities, nor even of mortal flesh;—it is my spirit that addresses your spirit; just as if both had passed through the grave, and we stood at God’s feet, equal,—as we are!”\n“As we are!” repeated Mr. Rochester—“so,” he added, enclosing me in his arms, gathering me to his breast, pressing his lips on my lips: “so, Jane!”",

Listen carefully!” As I listened, I began to cry uncontrollably; I couldn't hold back my pain anymore; I had to give in, and deep anguish made my entire body tremble. When I finally spoke, it was just to intensely wish that I had never been born or had never arrived at Thornfield. “Are you upset because you have to leave?” The powerful emotions of sorrow and affection swirling inside me were fighting for dominance, struggling to take complete control and assert their right to be the strongest, to conquer, to exist fully, emerge, and finally rule: and yes, to be expressed verbally. I am deeply saddened to depart Thornfield; I cherish Thornfield. I cherish it because I've experienced a rich and wonderful existence here, at least for a time. I haven't been oppressed or disregarded. I haven't been stifled. I haven't been stuck among dull people, cut off from any connection with what is brilliant, dynamic, and elevated. I've engaged directly with someone I admire and take pleasure in – a unique, powerful, and expansive intellect. I have known you, Mr. Rochester, and it fills me with fear and agony to realize I must inevitably be separated from you permanently. I understand why I must leave, and contemplating this necessity feels like contemplating death itself. “Why do you believe this is necessary?” he inquired abruptly. “Why? Sir, you are the one who has made it necessary for me.” “How so?” “In the form of Miss Ingram, a distinguished and lovely lady – your intended wife.” “My bride! Which bride? I don't have a bride!” “But you will.” “Yes, I will! I absolutely will!” He clenched his jaw. “In that case, I must leave; you've confirmed it yourself.” “No, you absolutely must remain! I promise, and I will keep this promise.” “I am telling you I must leave!” I shot back, feeling something akin to intense emotion rise within me. “Do you imagine I can remain here and become insignificant to you? Do you think I'm a mere machine, an automaton lacking emotion? Do you believe I can tolerate having my small comfort ripped away and my vital source of happiness spilled? Do you assume that because I am poor, unknown, unattractive, and small, I lack a soul or a heart? You are mistaken! I possess just as much soul as you, and a heart just as full! And if Providence had blessed me with beauty and significant wealth, I would have made it as difficult for you to part from me as it is for me to part from you now. I am not speaking to you through the usual channels of social rules, norms, or even our physical bodies; it is my spirit speaking directly to yours, as if we had both passed beyond death and stood before God, truly equal—which is what we are!” “That's what we are!” Mr. Rochester echoed, then pulling me into his embrace, drawing me close to his chest, and kissing my lips forcefully: “That's it, Jane!”",

Yes, I wanted it to be voiced.\n\n“I am sad to leave Thornfield. I love this place—because I’ve had a fulfilling and happy life here, even if only for a short time. I haven’t been treated badly, or turned to stone inside, or kept away from lively, bright company. Here, I’ve spoken openly with someone I respect and admire—someone brilliant and original. I have met you, Mr. Rochester, and it fills me with terror and pain to think I must leave you forever. I see that I have to go, and it feels as inevitable as death itself.”\n\n“Why do you say it’s necessary to go?” he asked suddenly.\n\n“Why? Because you’ve made it clear to me.”\n\n“How?”\n\n“By planning to marry Miss Ingram—a beautiful and noble woman. She is to be your wife.”\n\n“My wife? I have no bride!”\n\n“But you will.”\n\n“Yes—I will! I will!” He spoke fiercely.\n\n“Then I must go—you yourself have said it.”\n\n“No, you must stay! I swear it, and I will keep that promise.”\n\n“I tell you I must go!” I answered passionately. “Do you think I can remain here and mean nothing to you? Do you think I am just a machine without feeling, able to have basic comforts taken from me and not care? Just because I am poor, unknown, plain, and small, do you think I have no spirit or heart? You are wrong! I have just as much soul as you do, and just as much feeling! If God had made me beautiful and wealthy, I’d make it as hard for you to leave me as it is now for me to leave you.

I would scorn such a union: therefore I am better than you—let me go!”\n“Where, Jane? To Ireland?”\n“Yes—to Ireland. I have spoken my mind, and can go anywhere now.”\n“Jane, be still; don’t struggle so, like a wild frantic bird that is rending its own plumage in its desperation.”\n“I am no bird; and no net ensnares me; I am a free human being with an independent will, which I now exert to leave you.”\nAnother effort set me at liberty, and I stood erect before him.\n“And your will shall decide your destiny,” he said: “I offer you my hand, my heart, and a share of all my possessions.”\n“You play a farce, which I merely laugh at.”\n“I ask you to pass through life at my side—to be my second self, and best earthly companion.”\n“For that fate you have already made your choice, and must abide by it.”\n“Jane, be still a few moments: you are over-excited: I will be still too.”\nA waft of wind came sweeping down the laurel-walk, and trembled through the boughs of the chestnut: it wandered away—away—to an indefinite distance—it died. The nightingale’s song was then the only voice of the hour: in listening to it, I again wept. Mr. Rochester sat quiet, looking at me gently and seriously. Some time passed before he spoke; he at last said—\n“Come to my side, Jane, and let us explain and understand one another.”\n“I will never again come to your side: I am torn away now, and cannot return.”\n“But, Jane, I summon you as my wife: it is you only I intend to marry.”\nI was silent: I thought he mocked me.\n“Come, Jane—come hither.”\n“Your bride stands between us.”\nHe rose, and with a stride reached me.\n“My bride is here,” he said, again drawing me to him, “because my equal is here, and my likeness. Jane, will you marry me?”\nStill I did not answer, and still I writhed myself from his grasp: for I was still incredulous.\n“Do you doubt me, Jane?”\n“Entirely.”\n“You have no faith in me?”\n“Not a whit.”\n“Am I a liar in your eyes?” he asked passionately. “Little sceptic, you shall be convinced. What love have I for Miss Ingram? None: and that you know. What love has she for me? None: as I have taken pains to prove: I caused a rumour to reach her that my fortune was not a third of what was supposed, and after that I presented myself to see the result; it was coldness both from her and her mother. I would not—I could not—marry Miss Ingram. You—you strange, you almost unearthly thing!—I love as my own flesh. You—poor and obscure, and small and plain as you are—I entreat to accept me as a husband.”",
          "paraphrase_gemini-2.5-flash-preview-04-17": "I agreed, saying, “Yes, sir, that's true, but also not true.” I explained that he was essentially married, or very nearly, to someone beneath him, someone he didn't connect with or truly love. I knew this because I'd witnessed him making fun of her. I declared I would never accept such a marriage, which made me superior to him, and demanded to be released. He asked where I intended to go, specifically mentioning Ireland. I confirmed I would go to Ireland, stating that having expressed my feelings meant I could now go anywhere. He urged me to stop struggling, comparing my frantic movements to a wild bird tearing at its own feathers in desperation. I retorted that I was not a bird, trapped by no net, but a free person with my own will, which I was now using to depart from him. With another struggle, I broke free and stood upright facing him. He stated that my decision would shape my future and offered me his hand, his love, and everything he owned. I dismissed his offer as a joke that I simply found amusing. He asked me to spend my life with him, to be like another version of himself and his closest friend on earth. I told him he had already chosen his partner for life and had to accept that choice. He asked me to be quiet for a moment, saying I was too worked up, and promised to be still himself. A gust of wind blew along the laurel path, rustling the chestnut tree branches before fading into the distance and dying away. The only sound was the nightingale's singing, which made me weep again. Mr. Rochester remained silent, watching me with a kind and serious expression. After a while, he finally spoke, saying, “Come here, Jane, and let's talk things through and understand each other.” I replied that I would never stand beside him again, feeling I had been pulled away completely and could not go back. He insisted, “But Jane, I am calling you to be my wife; you are the only one I plan to marry.” I stayed silent, believing he was making fun of me. “Come, Jane—come closer.” I said, “Your intended bride is between us.” He got up and quickly covered the distance to reach me. Pulling me towards him again, he stated, “My bride is here,” explaining that his equal and his counterpart was standing before him. He then asked, “Jane, will you marry me?” I remained silent and continued to struggle out of his hold because I still couldn't believe him. “Do you doubt what I'm saying, Jane?” “Completely.” “You don't trust me at all?” “Not in the least.” Passionately, he asked if I considered him a liar, promising to convince \"little sceptic\" me. He stated he had no love for Miss Ingram, which I already knew, and she had none for him, which he had taken steps to confirm. He explained he had spread a rumour that his wealth was significantly less than believed, and when he appeared afterward, both she and her mother were distant. He declared he absolutely would not marry Miss Ingram. He then called me strange, almost otherworldly, and said he loved me intensely, like his own body.

Such a marriage is contemptible to me: so I consider myself better than you—let me go!\"\n\"Go where, Jane? To Ireland?\"\n\"Yes, to Ireland. I've spoken honestly, and now I can go wherever I please.\"\n\"Jane, please calm down; don't fight so wildly, like a desperate bird tearing its own feathers.\"\n\"I'm not a bird, and there's no trap binding me; I am a free person with an independent will, and I am using it to leave you.\"\nWith another effort, I broke free and stood tall before him.\n\"Your choices are your own,\" he said. \"I offer you my hand, my heart, and everything I have.\"\n\"You're playing a part that I find laughable.\"\n\"I'm asking you to spend your life by my side—to be my companion and closest friend.\"\n\"You've already chosen that fate, and you must stick to it.\"\n\"Jane, just be calm for a moment; you're upset, and I will try to be calm as well.\"\nA gust of wind rustled down the laurel path, shaking the chestnut branches.

Jane, will you marry me?\"\nI still didn't answer and pulled away from him, still unable to believe him.\n\"Do you not believe me, Jane?\"\n\"Not at all.\"\n\"Do you have no faith in me?\"\n\"None whatsoever.\"\nHe asked, passionately, \"Do you think I'm a liar? Little skeptic, I will convince you. Do I love Miss Ingram? Not at all, as you well know. Does she love me? Certainly not, and I made sure of it: I let a rumor spread that my wealth was much less than people thought, and when I saw her afterwards, both she and her mother were cold to me. I could not and would not marry Miss Ingram. You, strange and almost otherworldly as you are—I love you as I love myself. You—poor, unknown, plain, and small as you might be—are the one I beg to be my wife.\""

Rochester insisted he must have me entirely for himself and demanded I say yes quickly to his proposal. I asked to examine his face, requesting he turn towards the moonlight so I could try to read his expression. He told me to look, warning that his distressed face might be hard to interpret, but urged haste as he was suffering. His face was indeed visibly troubled and flushed, showing intense emotions in his features and unusual lights in his eyes. He cried out that my searching, yet loyal and kind, gaze was tormenting him. I questioned how that could be, stating that if his offer was real, my only feelings would be gratitude and devotion, which couldn't cause pain. He exclaimed \"Gratitude!\" and wildly urged me to accept quickly, to call him Edward and agree to marry him. I pressed him, asking if he was serious, if he truly loved me, and sincerely desired me as his wife. He affirmed he did, offering to swear if necessary. I then declared I would marry him. He called me \"Edward—my little wife!\", and I responded \"Dear Edward!\". Pulling me close and whispering deeply, with his cheek against mine, he told me to make him happy and he would make me happy. Soon after, he murmured about seeking God's forgiveness and defying human interference, asserting he had me and would keep me. I assured him there was no one, no family, to interfere. He responded that was ideal, and I noted that had I loved him less, his tone and look of triumph might have seemed savage. But sitting beside him, freed from the dread of separation and entering the joy of union, I could only focus on the overwhelming happiness I was experiencing. He repeatedly asked if I was happy, and each time I confirmed I was. Afterward, he quietly mused that this would make amends, justifying it by saying he found me friendless and unhappy and promising to protect and comfort me. He asserted that his love and steadfast intentions would atone before God's judgment, declaring he was indifferent to and defied the world's opinion.",

If you're being honest, and your proposal is genuine, all I can feel is gratitude and loyalty—those can't be torture.\"\n\n\"Gratitude!\" he repeated passionately. \"Jane, accept me quickly.

I have no relatives to stop us.\"\n\n\"No—that's what's best,\" he replied. And if my love had been less, I might have thought the way he looked and spoke in triumph was almost fierce; but sitting next to him, pulled from the misery of parting, and invited into the joy of being together, all I could think of was the happiness poured out for me to enjoy. Again and again, he asked, \"Are you happy, Jane?\" And again and again I replied, \"Yes.\" After which he murmured, \"It will make up for it—it will.

I had often been unwilling to look at my master, because I feared he could not be pleased at my look; but I was sure I might lift my face to his now, and not cool his affection by its expression. I took a plain but clean and light summer dress from my drawer and put it on: it seemed no attire had ever so well become me, because none had I ever worn in so blissful a mood.\nI was not surprised, when I ran down into the hall, to see that a brilliant June morning had succeeded to the tempest of the night; and to feel, through the open glass door, the breathing of a fresh and fragrant breeze. Nature must be gladsome when I was so happy. A beggar-woman and her little boy—pale, ragged objects both—were coming up the walk, and I ran down and gave them all the money I happened to have in my purse—some three or four shillings: good or bad, they must partake of my jubilee.

The reality of it would remain uncertain until I saw Mr. Rochester again and heard him reiterate his loving words and commitments. As I did my hair, I looked at my reflection and noticed my face was no longer plain. It now held a hopeful expression and vibrant colour, and my eyes seemed to shine as if they had witnessed the source of ultimate joy and reflected its radiance. I had often hesitated to look directly at my master, fearing he would find my appearance displeasing. But now I was confident I could meet his gaze without my look diminishing his affection. I chose a simple yet clean and airy summer dress from my drawer and put it on. It felt like no other garment had ever suited me so well, simply because I had never before worn anything while feeling so profoundly happy. Running downstairs, I was not surprised to find that a beautiful June morning had followed the previous night's storm, and that a fresh, sweet-smelling breeze was coming through the open glass door. It felt right that nature should be joyful when I was so utterly happy. Seeing a beggar woman and her small son, both looking pale and ragged, approaching the walk, I hurried out and gave them all the money I had with me, about three or four shillings. Regardless of their worthiness, they had to share in my happiness. The rooks cawed and other birds sang more cheerfully, but nothing felt as joyous or melodic as the happiness in my own heart. Mrs. Fairfax surprised me by looking out the window with a sorrowful face and speaking gravely, \"Miss Eyre, will you come to breakfast?\" Throughout the meal, she remained quiet and aloof, but I couldn't enlighten her then.

It seemed natural that the world should feel joyful when I was so happy. I spotted a poor woman and her little boy approaching, and I ran outside to give them all the change in my purse—three or four shillings—wanting them to share in my happiness. The rooks called and cheerful birds sang, but my own happy heart was the most joyous of all. Mrs. Fairfax appeared at the window with a somber face and calmly asked me to come to breakfast. Throughout the meal, she remained quiet and reserved; I couldn’t clarify things for her yet, as both of us needed to wait for Mr. Rochester to explain.

I gladly advanced; and it was not merely a cold word now, or even a shake of the hand that I received, but an embrace and a kiss. It seemed natural: it seemed genial to be so well loved, so caressed by him.\n“Jane, you look blooming, and smiling, and pretty,” said he: “truly pretty this morning. Is this my pale, little elf? Is this my mustard-seed? This little sunny-faced girl with the dimpled cheek and rosy lips; the satin-smooth hazel hair, and the radiant hazel eyes?” (I had green eyes, reader; but you must excuse the mistake: for him they were new-dyed, I suppose.)\n“It is Jane Eyre, sir.”\n“Soon to be Jane Rochester,” he added: “in four weeks, Janet; not a day more. Do you hear that?”\nI did, and I could not quite comprehend it: it made me giddy. The feeling, the announcement sent through me, was something stronger than was consistent with joy—something that smote and stunned: it was, I think, almost fear.\n“You blushed, and now you are white, Jane: what is that for?”\n“Because you gave me a new name—Jane Rochester; and it seems so strange.”\n“Yes, Mrs. Rochester,” said he; “young Mrs. Rochester—Fairfax Rochester’s girl-bride.”\n“It can never be, sir; it does not sound likely.

She readily approaches him, receiving not just a greeting or handshake but an embrace and a kiss. This physical display of affection feels natural and pleasant to her, given how much he seems to care for her. Mr. Rochester compliments her appearance, saying she looks healthy, happy, and attractive that morning, wondering if she's the same pale, small person he knew, describing her as sunny-faced with dimples, rosy lips, smooth dark hair, and bright dark eyes (though Jane notes her eyes are green, suggesting he's mistaken or sees them differently). Jane confirms she is Jane Eyre. He quickly adds that she will soon be Jane Rochester, specifically in four weeks, no longer, and asks if she understands. Jane hears him but struggles to fully grasp it; the announcement makes her feel lightheaded. The impact of his words is more profound than mere happiness—it's a shock, almost fear. He observes her changing from blushing to pale and asks the reason. She explains that the new name, Jane Rochester, sounds very strange. He repeats it playfully, calling her \"young Mrs. Rochester\" and his \"girl-bride.\" Jane insists it cannot happen, that it doesn't seem possible. She reflects that perfect happiness doesn't exist in this world and she doesn't believe she is destined for a different fate than other people, viewing the idea of such a future as unrealistic—a mere fantasy or wish.",

It felt right—it felt warm and wonderful to be cherished and shown such affection by him.\n“Jane, you look lively and cheerful, and quite pretty,” he remarked. “Really pretty today.

For God’s sake, don’t be ironical!”\n“I will make the world acknowledge you a beauty, too,” he went on, while I really became uneasy at the strain he had adopted, because I felt he was either deluding himself or trying to delude me. “I will attire my Jane in satin and lace, and she shall have roses in her hair; and I will cover the head I love best with a priceless veil.”\n“And then you won’t know me, sir; and I shall not be your Jane Eyre any longer, but an ape in a harlequin’s jacket—a jay in borrowed plumes.

He hoped to present them to her within a couple of days, promising her the same respect, advantages, and privileges he would offer a peer's daughter he was about to marry. Jane protested vehemently, exclaiming against the idea of receiving jewels, which she found unpleasant to even hear about. She felt it was 'unnatural and strange' for her, Jane Eyre, to have jewels and strongly preferred not to receive them. Mr. Rochester countered by describing how he would personally place the diamond necklace around her neck and the headpiece on her forehead, insisting it would suit her because, as he put it, 'nature, at least, has stamped her patent of nobility on this brow.' He added that he would secure bracelets on her 'fine wrists' and adorn her 'fairy-like fingers' with rings. Jane pleaded with him to change the subject and his manner of speaking, asking him not to address her as though she were beautiful and reminding him that she was simply his 'plain, Quakerish governess.' Mr. Rochester insisted that in his eyes, she *was* beautiful, precisely the 'delicate and aërial' type he desired. Jane interpreted this as him meaning she was 'puny and insignificant.' She accused him of either dreaming or mocking her and begged him to stop being ironic. Mr. Rochester continued, saying he would ensure the rest of the world recognized her beauty too. (The narrator noted feeling uneasy at the direction his conversation had taken, sensing he was either deceiving himself or attempting to deceive her.) He detailed his plans to dress his 'Jane' in 'satin and lace,' give her roses for her hair, and cover her beloved head with a 'priceless veil.' Jane responded that such a transformation would make him unable to recognize her, and she would cease to be his 'Jane Eyre,' becoming merely a pretense, like an actor in costume or a bird wearing borrowed feathers. She declared she would find it as awkward to see him dressed up for the stage as she would to be dressed in a court lady's gown. Finally, she stated that despite loving him dearly, indeed 'far too dearly to flatter' him, she did not consider him handsome and therefore requested he refrain from flattering her in return.",

Following a short stay there, I plan to take my cherished companion to warmer climates: the vineyards of France and the plains of Italy. She will witness all the famous historical and modern sights, experience city life, and gain a truer understanding of her worth by comparing herself with others.' I inquired, 'I'm going to travel?

And I will make you admit that I not only like, but truly love you—with sincerity, intensity, and constancy.' I questioned him again, 'Yet, aren't you unpredictable, sir?'

Did you ever love such an one?”\n“I love it now.”\n“But before me: if I, indeed, in any respect come up to your difficult standard?”\n“I never met your likeness. Jane, you please me, and you master me—you seem to submit, and I like the sense of pliancy you impart; and while I am twining the soft, silken skein round my finger, it sends a thrill up my arm to my heart. I am influenced—conquered; and the influence is sweeter than I can express; and the conquest I undergo has a witchery beyond any triumph I can win. Why do you smile, Jane? What does that inexplicable, that uncanny turn of countenance mean?”\n“I was thinking, sir (you will excuse the idea; it was involuntary), I was thinking of Hercules and Samson with their charmers—”\n“You were, you little elfish—”\n“Hush, sir! You don’t talk very wisely just now; any more than those gentlemen acted very wisely. However, had they been married, they would no doubt by their severity as husbands have made up for their softness as suitors; and so will you, I fear. I wonder how you will answer me a year hence, should I ask a favour it does not suit your convenience or pleasure to grant.”\n“Ask me something now, Janet,—the least thing: I desire to be entreated—”\n“Indeed I will, sir; I have my petition all ready.”\n“Speak! But if you look up and smile with that countenance, I shall swear concession before I know to what, and that will make a fool of me.”\n“Not at all, sir; I ask only this: don’t send for the jewels, and don’t crown me with roses: you might as well put a border of gold lace round that plain pocket handkerchief you have there.”\n“I might as well ‘gild refined gold.’ I know it: your request is granted then—for the time. I will remand the order I despatched to my banker. But you have not yet asked for anything; you have prayed a gift to be withdrawn: try again.”\n“Well then, sir, have the goodness to gratify my curiosity, which is much piqued on one point.”\nHe looked disturbed. “What? what?” he said hastily. “Curiosity is a dangerous petition: it is well I have not taken a vow to accord every request—”\n“But there can be no danger in complying with this, sir.”\n“Utter it, Jane: but I wish that instead of a mere inquiry into, perhaps, a secret, it was a wish for half my estate.”\n“Now, King Ahasuerus! What do I want with half your estate? Do you think I am a Jew-usurer, seeking good investment in land? I would much rather have all your confidence. You will not exclude me from your confidence if you admit me to your heart?”\n“You are welcome to all my confidence that is worth having, Jane; but for God’s sake, don’t desire a useless burden! Don’t long for poison—don’t turn out a downright Eve on my hands!”\n“Why not, sir? You have just been telling me how much you liked to be conquered, and how pleasant over-persuasion is to you. Don’t you think I had better take advantage of the confession, and begin and coax and entreat—even cry and be sulky if necessary—for the sake of a mere essay of my power?”\n“I dare you to any such experiment. Encroach, presume, and the game is up.”\n“Is it, sir? You soon give in. How stern you look now! Your eyebrows have become as thick as my finger, and your forehead resembles what, in some very astonishing poetry, I once saw styled, ‘a blue-piled thunderloft.’ That will be your married look, sir, I suppose?”\n“If that will be your married look, I, as a Christian, will soon give up the notion of consorting with a mere sprite or salamander. But what had you to ask, thing,—out with it?”\n“There, you are less than civil now; and I like rudeness a great deal better than flattery. I had rather be a thing than an angel. This is what I have to ask,—Why did you take such pains to make me believe you wished to marry Miss Ingram?”",
          "paraphrase_gemini-2.5-flash-preview-04-17": "She asked if he had ever encountered or loved someone like her before. He replied he loved it now. Jane then inquired what about before her, questioning if she truly met his high standards. Rochester stated he had never met anyone quite like her. He found her pleasing and commanding, appreciating her apparent submission and the sense of flexibility she conveyed, likening the feeling of winding her seemingly soft nature around his finger to a thrilling sensation that went straight to his heart. He felt influenced and overcome, finding this impact sweeter than he could articulate, and this defeat held a magic greater than any victory he could achieve. He asked why she was smiling and what her unusual, puzzling expression meant. Jane explained (apologizing for the spontaneous thought) she was thinking of strong figures like Hercules and Samson and how they were influenced by women. Rochester interrupted, calling her a 'little elfish' creature. Jane told him to hush, suggesting he wasn't speaking wisely, just as those men didn't act wisely. She speculated that if they had married, they would likely have balanced their softness as suitors with severity as husbands, fearing he would do the same. She wondered how he would respond in a year if she asked for something inconvenient. Rochester urged her to ask for something, anything, immediately, expressing a desire to be pleaded with. Jane affirmed she would, saying she had her request ready. He told her to speak but warned that if she looked up and smiled with that expression, he would agree to whatever it was before knowing, making him look foolish. Jane assured him it wouldn't make him foolish and her request was simple: don't order the jewels and don't place roses on her head, comparing it to adding gold lace to a plain handkerchief. Rochester agreed it would be like 'gilding refined gold,' granting her request for the moment and promising to cancel the jewel order. However, he pointed out she hadn't asked for something new, only for a gift to be withheld, telling her to try again. Jane then asked him to satisfy her intense curiosity about one specific matter. Looking unsettled, he asked hastily what it was, calling curiosity a dangerous request and expressing relief he hadn't vowed to grant every request. Jane assured him there was no danger in complying with this one. He told her to state it, but wished it was a request for half his estate instead of an inquiry into a possible secret. Jane, comparing him to King Ahasuerus, asked why she would want half his estate, dismissing the idea of being a 'Jew-usurer' looking for land investment. She stated she would much prefer his complete trust, asking if he would share all his confidences with her if he admitted her to his heart. Rochester stated she was welcome to any confidence of his worth having but pleaded with her not to desire a useless burden, poison, or become a 'downright Eve' in his life. Jane challenged this, asking why not, since he had just spoken of how much he enjoyed being conquered and persuaded. She asked if she shouldn't take advantage of his confession and begin to coax, plead, even cry or be sulky, just to test her influence. Rochester dared her to attempt such an experiment, warning that if she encroached or presumed, their dynamic would end. Jane commented on how quickly he seemed to give in and how stern he looked, describing his thick eyebrows and forehead, comparing the latter to a poetic phrase about a 'blue-piled thunderloft,' suggesting this would be his look in marriage. Rochester countered that if that would be her married look, he, as a Christian, would quickly abandon the idea of marrying a 'sprite or salamander.' He then impatiently demanded she state what she wanted to ask. Jane noted he was being less polite now but preferred rudeness to flattery, preferring to be called a 'thing' over an 'angel.' She then stated her question: why he went to such lengths to make her believe he intended to marry Miss Ingram.",

Have you ever loved such a person?”\n“I love that now.”\n“But before me—if I even come close to your high expectations at all?”\n“I have never met anyone like you. Jane, you delight me and you have a hold over me—you act as though you yield, and I enjoy the feeling of gentleness you give; and as I wind the soft, delicate thread around my finger, it sends a sensation from my arm to my heart. I am affected—overcome; and the feeling is more pleasant than words can say; the victory you have over me has more magic than any achievement I could accomplish. Why are you smiling, Jane? What does that mysterious, odd look on your face mean?”\n“I was just thinking, sir (forgive me; I couldn’t help it), I was thinking of Hercules and Samson and their enchantresses—”\n“So you were, you little imp—”\n“Quiet, sir! You aren’t speaking very sensibly just now, just as those men didn’t act wisely. Still, if they had been married, they’d likely make up for being soft as lovers by being strict as husbands; and I fear you will be the same. I wonder how you’d respond a year from now if I asked for something you didn’t want to give.”\n“Ask me something now, Janet—anything at all: I want to be petitioned—”\n“I will, sir; I already know what to request.”\n“Then say it! But if you look up and smile like that, I’ll say yes before I even know what it is, and you’ll make a fool of me.”\n“Not at all, sir; my only request is this: please don’t order jewels for me, and don’t crown me with roses; it’s as if you put fancy gold trim on that plain handkerchief you have.”\n“I might as well decorate pure gold. I understand—you have your wish, for now. I’ll cancel the order I sent to my banker. But you still haven’t asked for anything; you’ve just asked for a gift to be taken away: try again.”\n“Well then, sir, please satisfy my curiosity about something that’s really been on my mind.”\nHe looked uneasy. “What? What is it?” he asked quickly. “Curiosity is a risky thing to ask for: it’s good I haven’t promised to grant every wish—”\n“But there’s no harm in answering this, sir.”\n“Tell me, Jane: but I wish it was a request for half my property instead of a question about some secret.”\n“Oh, King Ahasuerus! Why would I want half your estate? Do you think I’m just a money-lender after land? I’d much prefer to have all your trust. If you let me into your heart, you won’t shut me out of your confidence, will you?”\n“You’re welcome to all the trust I have that’s worth anything, Jane; but please, don’t ask for pointless burdens! Don’t wish for something harmful—don’t become an Eve to tempt me!”\n“Why not, sir? You just said you enjoy being won over and persuaded by someone. Maybe I should take advantage of your admission and try coaxing and pleading—even sulking if I must—just to see how much power I have?”\n“I dare you to try such a thing. Cross the line, overstep, and it’s over.”\n“Is that so, sir? You give in quickly. How stern you look now! Your eyebrows are thick as my finger, and your forehead looks like what some poet once called a ‘blue-piled thunderloft.’ Is that how you’ll look as a married man?”\n“If that’s how you’ll look, I, being Christian, may have to give up marrying a mere spirit or fire-creature. Now, what was it you wanted, creature—out with it?”\n“Now you’re being less than polite; and I much prefer rudeness to flattery. I’d rather be called a creature than an angel. What I want to ask is: Why did you go to such lengths to make me think you wanted to marry Miss Ingram?”"

You glowed in the cool moonlight last night, when you mutinied against fate, and claimed your rank as my equal. Janet, by-the-bye, it was you who made me the offer.”\n“Of course I did. But to the point if you please, sir—Miss Ingram?”\n“Well, I feigned courtship of Miss Ingram, because I wished to render you as madly in love with me as I was with you; and I knew jealousy would be the best ally I could call in for the furtherance of that end.”\n“Excellent! Now you are small—not one whit bigger than the end of my little finger. It was a burning shame and a scandalous disgrace to act in that way. Did you think nothing of Miss Ingram’s feelings, sir?”\n“Her feelings are concentrated in one—pride; and that needs humbling. Were you jealous, Jane?”\n“Never mind, Mr. Rochester: it is in no way interesting to you to know that. Answer me truly once more. Do you think Miss Ingram will not suffer from your dishonest coquetry? Won’t she feel forsaken and deserted?”\n“Impossible!—when I told you how she, on the contrary, deserted me: the idea of my insolvency cooled, or rather extinguished, her flame in a moment.”\n“You have a curious, designing mind, Mr. Rochester. I am afraid your principles on some points are eccentric.”\n“My principles were never trained, Jane: they may have grown a little awry for want of attention.”\n“Once again, seriously; may I enjoy the great good that has been vouchsafed to me, without fearing that any one else is suffering the bitter pain I myself felt a while ago?”\n“That you may, my good little girl: there is not another being in the world has the same pure love for me as yourself—for I lay that pleasant unction to my soul, Jane, a belief in your affection.”\nI turned my lips to the hand that lay on my shoulder. I loved him very much—more than I could trust myself to say—more than words had power to express.\n“Ask something more,” he said presently; “it is my delight to be entreated, and to yield.”\nI was again ready with my request. “Communicate your intentions to Mrs. Fairfax, sir: she saw me with you last night in the hall, and she was shocked. Give her some explanation before I see her again. It pains me to be misjudged by so good a woman.”",

Thank goodness it's nothing worse!\" He then relaxed his stern expression, smiled down at me, and gently stroked my hair, appearing pleased that a potential problem had been avoided. He continued, \"Jane, I feel I should admit something, even if it makes you a bit angry – and I know how fiery you can be when you're upset. You were quite the passionate spirit under the moonlight last night when you defied fate and asserted your equality with me. By the way, Janet, you were the one who proposed.\" I replied, \"Of course I did. But please, sir, let's get to the main point – Miss Ingram?\" Rochester explained, \"Well, I pretended to court Miss Ingram because I wanted you to fall as deeply in love with me as I was with you; and I knew jealousy would be the most effective strategy to achieve that.\" I retorted, \"That's terrible! Absolutely shameful and outrageous behavior. Didn't you consider Miss Ingram's feelings at all, sir?\" He stated, \"Her emotions are focused solely on one thing – pride; and that needs to be humbled. Were you jealous, Jane?\" I sidestepped the question, \"It doesn't matter, Mr. Rochester; it's not relevant to you. But answer me honestly again. Don't you think Miss Ingram will suffer from your deceitful flirting? Won't she feel abandoned and hurt?\" He insisted, \"Not at all! As I told you, she was the one who abandoned me; the news of my potential lack of money instantly cooled, or rather extinguished, her affection.\" I commented, \"You have a peculiar, manipulative way of thinking, Mr. Rochester. I'm afraid your moral standards on some matters are rather unusual.\" He responded, \"My principles were never properly developed, Jane; they may have grown a bit crooked due to neglect.\" I asked again, seriously, \"Can I truly enjoy the great happiness that has come to me, without worrying that someone else is enduring the bitter pain I recently experienced?\" He reassured me, \"Yes, my dear girl, you can; there is no other person in the world who loves me with the same pure affection as you – I find great comfort in that belief in your devotion, Jane.\" I brought my lips to the hand resting on my shoulder. I loved him deeply – more than I dared say, more than words could possibly express. \"Ask for something else,\" he said shortly after; \"I enjoy being asked and agreeing.\" I quickly made another request. \"Please inform Mrs. Fairfax of your intentions, sir; she saw me with you in the hall last night and was shocked.

Last night, you shone in the moonlight as you defied your destiny and claimed your status as my equal. By the way, Janet, you were the one who proposed to me.”\n\n“I did, of course.

Now you've shrunk—not even as big as my little finger. What you did was absolutely wrong and disgraceful. Didn't you consider Miss Ingram’s feelings, sir?”\n\n“Her feelings only concern her pride; and that could use some humbling. Were you jealous, Jane?”\n\n“That doesn’t matter, Mr. Rochester; it’s none of your business. Please answer me honestly once more. Do you think Miss Ingram won't be hurt by your deceitful flirtation? Won't she feel abandoned?”\n\n“Impossible! I already explained that she, instead, abandoned me: as soon as she learned of my supposed lack of wealth, her affection disappeared instantly.”\n\n“You are calculating, Mr. Rochester. I fear your morals are rather unusual in some areas.”\n\n“My morals were never properly taught, Jane; maybe they've become a bit warped without guidance.”\n\n“Again, seriously—can I be truly happy about this blessing I've received, without worrying that someone else is suffering, like I did before?”\n\n“You can, my dear girl: there's no one else in the world who loves me as sincerely as you do—I take great comfort in believing in your love, Jane.”\n\nI kissed the hand resting on my shoulder. I loved him deeply—far more than I could ever admit or put into words.\n\n“Ask me something else,” he said after a while; “I enjoy being asked favors and granting them.”\n\nI was ready with another request. “Please tell Mrs. Fairfax your intentions, sir; she saw us together last night and was shocked.

Did she think, Janet, you had given the world for love, and considered it well lost?”\n“I believe she thought I had forgotten my station, and yours, sir.”\n“Station! station!—your station is in my heart, and on the necks of those who would insult you, now or hereafter.—Go.”\nI was soon dressed; and when I heard Mr. Rochester quit Mrs. Fairfax’s parlour, I hurried down to it. The old lady had been reading her morning portion of Scripture—the Lesson for the day; her Bible lay open before her, and her spectacles were upon it. Her occupation, suspended by Mr. Rochester’s announcement, seemed now forgotten: her eyes, fixed on the blank wall opposite, expressed the surprise of a quiet mind stirred by unwonted tidings. Seeing me, she roused herself: she made a sort of effort to smile, and framed a few words of congratulation; but the smile expired, and the sentence was abandoned unfinished. She put up her spectacles, shut the Bible, and pushed her chair back from the table.\n“I feel so astonished,” she began, “I hardly know what to say to you, Miss Eyre. I have surely not been dreaming, have I? Sometimes I half fall asleep when I am sitting alone and fancy things that have never happened. It has seemed to me more than once when I have been in a doze, that my dear husband, who died fifteen years since, has come in and sat down beside me; and that I have even heard him call me by my name, Alice, as he used to do. Now, can you tell me whether it is actually true that Mr. Rochester has asked you to marry him? Don’t laugh at me. But I really thought he came in here five minutes ago, and said that in a month you would be his wife.”\n“He has said the same thing to me,” I replied.\n“He has! Do you believe him? Have you accepted him?”\n“Yes.”\nShe looked at me bewildered.\n“I could never have thought it. He is a proud man: all the Rochesters were proud: and his father, at least, liked money. He, too, has always been called careful. He means to marry you?”\n“He tells me so.”\nShe surveyed my whole person: in her eyes I read that they had there found no charm powerful enough to solve the enigma.\n“It passes me!” she continued; “but no doubt it is true since you say so. How it will answer, I cannot tell: I really don’t know. Equality of position and fortune is often advisable in such cases; and there are twenty years of difference in your ages. He might almost be your father.”\n“No, indeed, Mrs. Fairfax!” exclaimed I, nettled; “he is nothing like my father! No one, who saw us together, would suppose it for an instant. Mr. Rochester looks as young, and is as young, as some men at five-and-twenty.”\n“Is it really for love he is going to marry you?” she asked.\nI was so hurt by her coldness and scepticism, that the tears rose to my eyes.\n“I am sorry to grieve you,” pursued the widow; “but you are so young, and so little acquainted with men, I wished to put you on your guard. It is an old saying that ‘all is not gold that glitters;’ and in this case I do fear there will be something found to be different to what either you or I expect.”\n“Why?—am I a monster?” I said: “is it impossible that Mr. Rochester should have a sincere affection for me?”\n“No: you are very well; and much improved of late; and Mr. Rochester, I daresay, is fond of you. I have always noticed that you were a sort of pet of his. There are times when, for your sake, I have been a little uneasy at his marked preference, and have wished to put you on your guard: but I did not like to suggest even the possibility of wrong. I knew such an idea would shock, perhaps offend you; and you were so discreet, and so thoroughly modest and sensible, I hoped you might be trusted to protect yourself. Last night I cannot tell you what I suffered when I sought all over the house, and could find you nowhere, nor the master either; and then, at twelve o’clock, saw you come in with him.”\n“Well, never mind that now,” I interrupted impatiently; “it is enough that all was right.”\n“I hope all will be right in the end,” she said: “but believe me, you cannot be too careful. Try and keep Mr. Rochester at a distance: distrust yourself as well as him. Gentlemen in his station are not accustomed to marry their governesses.”",
          "paraphrase_gemini-2.5-flash-preview-04-17": "He told her to go upstairs and put on her bonnet, explaining he planned for her to join him on a trip to Millcote that morning. While she got ready, he said he would clarify things for the elderly lady. He asked if Jane believed Mrs. Fairfax thought she had given up everything for love, considering it a worthwhile sacrifice. Jane replied that she thought Mrs. Fairfax felt she had disregarded her social position, as well as his. Rochester reacted strongly, insisting that her position was in his heart and that he would overcome anyone who dared insult her, now or ever, and again told her to go. Jane dressed quickly and, upon hearing Mr. Rochester leave Mrs. Fairfax's sitting room, she went down to it herself. The older woman had been reading her morning Bible passage; the book was open before her with her spectacles resting on it. Her reading, interrupted by Mr. Rochester's announcement, seemed forgotten now; her eyes, staring at the blank wall opposite, conveyed the shock of a tranquil mind disturbed by surprising news. Seeing Jane, she snapped back to attention, making an effort to smile and beginning to offer congratulations, but the smile vanished, and the sentence was left unfinished. She took off her spectacles, closed her Bible, and pushed her chair away from the table. She admitted she felt so bewildered she barely knew what to say to Jane Eyre. She questioned if she had been dreaming, noting that sometimes when she was alone and dozing, she would imagine things that hadn't happened, like her deceased husband, who died fifteen years prior, coming in and sitting with her and even hearing him call her 'Alice' as he used to. She then asked if it was truly factual that Mr. Rochester had proposed marriage, urging Jane not to laugh at her, but explaining she genuinely thought he had just come in and said Jane would be his wife in a month. Jane confirmed that he had told her the same thing. Mrs. Fairfax asked if he had, if Jane believed him, and if she had accepted. Jane replied, 'Yes.' Mrs. Fairfax looked at her with confusion, stating she would never have imagined it possible. She described him as a proud man, mentioning that all the Rochesters were proud and his father had been fond of money, and that Rochester himself was considered careful. She asked again if he truly intended to marry her. Jane confirmed that was what he said. Mrs. Fairfax studied Jane from head to toe, conveying through her gaze that she found nothing outwardly powerful enough to explain the puzzle. She continued that it was beyond her comprehension, but accepted it must be true since Jane said so. However, she couldn't predict how it would turn out, admitting she truly didn't know. She noted that equal social standing and wealth were often advisable in such situations and pointed out the twenty-year age gap, saying he could almost be her father. Annoyed, Jane exclaimed that he was nothing like her father and no one who saw them together would think so for a moment, asserting that Mr. Rochester looked and was as youthful as some men in their mid-twenties. Mrs. Fairfax then asked if he was genuinely marrying her out of love. Jane was so hurt by her coldness and doubt that her eyes welled up with tears. The widow continued, apologizing for upsetting her but explaining that because Jane was so young and inexperienced with men, she wanted to caution her. She quoted the old saying, 'all is not gold that glitters,' and confessed her fear that in this instance, things would turn out differently from what either of them expected. Jane retorted, asking if she was a 'monster' and if it was impossible for Mr. Rochester to feel sincere affection for her. Mrs. Fairfax replied that Jane was perfectly fine and much improved lately, and she supposed Mr. Rochester was fond of her, having always noticed she was a sort of favorite of his. She admitted there were times when his obvious preference for Jane had made her slightly uneasy for Jane's sake, wishing she had warned her, but she didn't want to suggest anything improper, knowing the idea would shock and perhaps offend her. Because Jane was so discreet, modest, and sensible, she had hoped she could be trusted to protect herself. She confessed she couldn't describe how much she had suffered the previous night searching the whole house and finding neither Jane nor the master, and then seeing them return together at midnight. Jane interrupted impatiently, saying it didn't matter now and that it was enough that everything was alright. Mrs. Fairfax responded that she hoped everything would turn out right in the end, but urged Jane to believe her that she couldn't be too careful. She advised her to try and keep Mr. Rochester at a distance and to be cautious of herself as well as him, reminding her that gentlemen of his status were not accustomed to marrying their governesses.",

Did she really think, Janet, that you had given up everything for love and thought it was a fair trade?\"\n\n\"I think she believes I forgot both my place and yours, sir.\"\n\n\"Place! Your place is in my heart, and protected from anyone who would insult you now, or ever. Go.\"\n\nI dressed quickly; when I heard Mr. Rochester leave Mrs. Fairfax’s parlor, I went in. The old lady had been reading her morning Bible lesson; her Bible lay open with her spectacles on top. She had been interrupted by Mr. Rochester’s news and now seemed lost in thought, her eyes fixed in surprise on the wall. Seeing me, she stirred, tried to smile and say a few congratulatory words, but the smile faded, and she couldn’t finish. She put on her spectacles again, closed the Bible, and pushed her chair away from the table.\n\n\"I am so shocked,\" she said, \"I hardly know what to say to you, Miss Eyre. Am I dreaming? Sometimes when I’m sitting alone I drift off and imagine things that aren’t real. It’s happened that I’ve thought my dear husband, who died fifteen years ago, walked in and sat with me, even calling my name, Alice, as he used to do. Now, can you tell me: is it really true Mr. Rochester asked you to marry him? Don’t laugh at me, but I really thought he came in just now and said you’d be his wife in a month.\"\n\n\"He told me the same,\" I answered.\n\n\"He did! Do you believe him? Did you accept?\"\n\n\"Yes.\"\n\nShe looked at me, confused.\n\n\"I never would have thought it. He is a proud man; all the Rochesters have been, and his father cared a lot about money. He always seemed careful, too. He’s really going to marry you?\"\n\n\"That's what he says.\"\n\nShe looked me over, and in her eyes I saw she found nothing about me to explain why he would.\n\n\"It’s beyond me! But it must be true if you say so. I don’t know how it will turn out; honestly, I can't tell. Marrying someone of equal status and wealth is generally a good idea; and he’s twenty years older than you. He could almost be your father.\"\n\n\"Not at all, Mrs. Fairfax!\" I replied, offended. \"He’s nothing like my father; no one seeing us together would think so. Mr. Rochester looks and acts as young as any man of twenty-five.\"\n\n\"Is he really marrying you for love?\" she asked.\n\nHer skepticism stung me, and I began to cry.\n\n\"I’m sorry to upset you,\" she went on, \"but you’re so young and know so little of men, I just wanted to warn you. There’s a saying, 'not all that glitters is gold;' in this case, I’m afraid things could turn out differently than we expect.\"\n\n\"Why? Do you think I’m so unworthy that Mr. Rochester couldn’t honestly love me?\"\n\n\"No: you are quite pleasant, and lately you’ve improved; and I’m sure Mr. Rochester is fond of you. I’ve always noticed his special favor towards you, and for your sake, I have sometimes worried, wanting to warn you, but not wanting to even suggest anything improper, since I knew it might shock or upset you. You have always been so reserved and sensible, I hoped you could take care of yourself. Last night I can’t tell you how distressed I was searching the house for you and the master, and then at midnight seeing you come home with him.\"\n\n\"Let’s leave that alone for now,\" I interrupted, \"All was proper.\"\n\n\"I do hope it will all work out,\" she said. \"But truly, you can’t be too cautious. Try to keep Mr. Rochester at a distance. Distrust both yourself and him. Gentlemen of his status rarely marry their governesses.\""

          "text_segment": "I was growing truly irritated: happily, Adèle ran in.\n“Let me go,—let me go to Millcote too!” she cried. “Mr. Rochester won’t: though there is so much room in the new carriage. Beg him to let me go, mademoiselle.”\n“That I will, Adèle;” and I hastened away with her, glad to quit my gloomy monitress. The carriage was ready: they were bringing it round to the front, and my master was pacing the pavement, Pilot following him backwards and forwards.\n“Adèle may accompany us, may she not, sir?”\n“I told her no. I’ll have no brats!—I’ll have only you.”\n“Do let her go, Mr. Rochester, if you please: it would be better.”\n“Not it: she will be a restraint.”\nHe was quite peremptory, both in look and voice. The chill of Mrs. Fairfax’s warnings, and the damp of her doubts were upon me: something of unsubstantiality and uncertainty had beset my hopes. I half lost the sense of power over him. I was about mechanically to obey him, without further remonstrance; but as he helped me into the carriage, he looked at my face.\n“What is the matter?” he asked; “all the sunshine is gone. Do you really wish the bairn to go? Will it annoy you if she is left behind?”\n“I would far rather she went, sir.”\n“Then off for your bonnet, and back like a flash of lightning!” cried he to Adèle.\nShe obeyed him with what speed she might.\n“After all, a single morning’s interruption will not matter much,” said he, “when I mean shortly to claim you—your thoughts, conversation, and company—for life.”\nAdèle, when lifted in, commenced kissing me, by way of expressing her gratitude for my intercession: she was instantly stowed away into a corner on the other side of him. She then peeped round to where I sat; so stern a neighbour was too restrictive: to him, in his present fractious mood, she dared whisper no observations, nor ask of him any information.\n“Let her come to me,” I entreated: “she will, perhaps, trouble you, sir: there is plenty of room on this side.”\nHe handed her over as if she had been a lapdog. “I’ll send her to school yet,” he said, but now he was smiling.\nAdèle heard him, and asked if she was to go to school “sans mademoiselle?”\n“Yes,” he replied, “absolutely sans mademoiselle; for I am to take mademoiselle to the moon, and there I shall seek a cave in one of the white valleys among the volcano-tops, and mademoiselle shall live with me there, and only me.”\n“She will have nothing to eat: you will starve her,” observed Adèle.\n“I shall gather manna for her morning and night: the plains and hillsides in the moon are bleached with manna, Adèle.”\n“She will want to warm herself: what will she do for a fire?”\n“Fire rises out of the lunar mountains: when she is cold, I’ll carry her up to a peak, and lay her down on the edge of a crater.”\n“Oh, qu’elle y sera mal—peu comfortable! And her clothes, they will wear out: how can she get new ones?”\nMr. Rochester professed to be puzzled. “Hem!” said he. “What would you do, Adèle? Cudgel your brains for an expedient. How would a white or a pink cloud answer for a gown, do you think? And one could cut a pretty enough scarf out of a rainbow.”\n“She is far better as she is,” concluded Adèle, after musing some time: “besides, she would get tired of living with only you in the moon. If I were mademoiselle, I would never consent to go with you.”\n“She has consented: she has pledged her word.”\n“But you can’t get her there; there is no road to the moon: it is all air; and neither you nor she can fly.”\n“Adèle, look at that field.” We were now outside Thornfield gates, and bowling lightly along the smooth road to Millcote, where the dust was well laid by the thunderstorm, and, where the low hedges and lofty timber trees on each side glistened green and rain-refreshed.\n“In that field, Adèle, I was walking late one evening about a fortnight since—the evening of the day you helped me to make hay in the orchard meadows; and, as I was tired with raking swaths, I sat down to rest me on a stile; and there I took out a little book and a pencil, and began to write about a misfortune that befell me long ago, and a wish I had for happy days to come: I was writing away very fast, though daylight was fading from the leaf, when something came up the path and stopped two yards off me. I looked at it. It was a little thing with a veil of gossamer on its head. I beckoned it to come near me; it stood soon at my knee. I never spoke to it, and it never spoke to me, in words; but I read its eyes, and it read mine; and our speechless colloquy was to this effect—\n“It was a fairy, and come from Elf-land, it said; and its errand was to make me happy: I must go with it out of the common world to a lonely place—such as the moon, for instance—and it nodded its head towards her horn, rising over Hay-hill: it told me of the alabaster cave and silver vale where we might live. I said I should like to go; but reminded it, as you did me, that I had no wings to fly.\n“‘Oh,’ returned the fairy, ‘that does not signify! Here is a talisman will remove all difficulties;’ and she held out a pretty gold ring. ‘Put it,’ she said, ‘on the fourth finger of my left hand, and I am yours, and you are mine; and we shall leave earth, and make our own heaven yonder.’ She nodded again at the moon. The ring, Adèle, is in my breeches-pocket, under the disguise of a sovereign: but I mean soon to change it to a ring again.”\n“But what has mademoiselle to do with it? I don’t care for the fairy: you said it was mademoiselle you would take to the moon?”\n“Mademoiselle is a fairy,” he said, whispering mysteriously. Whereupon I told her not to mind his badinage; and she, on her part, evinced a fund of genuine French scepticism: denominating Mr. Rochester “un vrai menteur,” and assuring him that she made no account whatever of his “contes de fée,” and that “du reste, il n’y avait pas de fées, et quand même il y en avait:” she was sure they would never appear to him, nor ever give him rings, or offer to live with him in the moon.\nThe hour spent at Millcote was a somewhat harassing one to me. Mr. Rochester obliged me to go to a certain silk warehouse: there I was ordered to choose half-a-dozen dresses. I hated the business, I begged leave to defer it: no—it should be gone through with now. By dint of entreaties expressed in energetic whispers, I reduced the half-dozen to two: these however, he vowed he would select himself. With anxiety I watched his eye rove over the gay stores: he fixed on a rich silk of the most brilliant amethyst dye, and a superb pink satin. I told him in a new series of whispers, that he might as well buy me a gold gown and a silver bonnet at once: I should certainly never venture to wear his choice. With infinite difficulty, for he was stubborn as a stone, I persuaded him to make an exchange in favour of a sober black satin and pearl-grey silk. “It might pass for the present,” he said; “but he would yet see me glittering like a parterre.”\nGlad was I to get him out of the silk warehouse, and then out of a jeweller’s shop: the more he bought me, the more my cheek burned with a sense of annoyance and degradation. As we re-entered the carriage, and I sat back feverish and fagged, I remembered what, in the hurry of events, dark and bright, I had wholly forgotten—the letter of my uncle, John Eyre, to Mrs. Reed: his intention to adopt me and make me his legatee. “It would, indeed, be a relief,” I thought, “if I had ever so small an independency; I never can bear being dressed like a doll by Mr. Rochester, or sitting like a second Danae with the golden shower falling daily round me. I will write to Madeira the moment I get home, and tell my uncle John I am going to be married, and to whom: if I had but a prospect of one day bringing Mr. Rochester an accession of fortune, I could better endure to be kept by him now.” And somewhat relieved by this idea (which I failed not to execute that day), I ventured once more to meet my master’s and lover’s eye, which most pertinaciously sought mine, though I averted both face and gaze. He smiled; and I thought his smile was such as a sultan might, in a blissful and fond moment, bestow on a slave his gold and gems had enriched: I crushed his hand, which was ever hunting mine, vigorously, and thrust it back to him red with the passionate pressure.",
          "paraphrase_gemini-2.5-flash-preview-04-17": "I was becoming genuinely annoyed when, thankfully, Adèle rushed in. 'Let me come,' she exclaimed, 'let me go to Millcote too! Mr. Rochester won't agree, even though there's plenty of space in the new carriage. Please ask him to let me go, mademoiselle.' 'I certainly will, Adèle,' I replied, quickly leaving with her, relieved to escape my gloomy monitor. The carriage was prepared, being brought around to the front of the house, and my employer was pacing the flagstone path, with Pilot following his movements. 'May Adèle accompany us, sir?' I asked. 'I told her no,' he responded. 'I don't want children! I only want you.' 'Please let her come, Mr. Rochester,' I urged, 'it would be better.' 'No,' he countered, 'she'd be a nuisance.' His tone and expression were completely decisive. The chill of Mrs. Fairfax's warnings and the dampness of her doubts were affecting me; my hopes felt somewhat insubstantial and uncertain. I felt I had partly lost my influence over him. I was about to mechanically agree without further protest, but as he helped me into the carriage, he looked at my face. 'What's wrong?' he asked, 'all your brightness is gone. Do you truly want the child to come? Will it bother you if she stays behind?' 'I would much prefer her to go, sir.' 'Then go get your hat immediately!' he cried to Adèle. She obeyed as fast as possible. 'After all,' he said, 'a short interruption this morning won't matter much, since I plan to claim your time, thoughts, conversation, and presence for my entire life soon.' Once helped into the carriage, Adèle began kissing me to show how grateful she was for my asking on her behalf; she was promptly settled into a corner across from him. She then peered around at where I sat; such a severe companion was too restrictive. With him in his current irritable mood, she didn't dare whisper comments or ask him for information. 'Let her come sit with me,' I pleaded, 'she might bother you, sir; there's ample room on this side.' He passed her over as if she were a pet. 'I'll still send her to school eventually,' he said, now smiling. Adèle heard him and asked if she would attend school 'sans mademoiselle?' 'Yes,' he replied, 'absolutely without mademoiselle; because I am taking mademoiselle to the moon, and there I will find a cave in one of the pale valleys among the volcano peaks, and mademoiselle will live there with me, and only me.' 'She'll have nothing to eat: you'll starve her,' Adèle pointed out. 'I will collect manna for her morning and night; the plains and slopes on the moon are covered in manna, Adèle.' 'She'll need to keep warm: what will she do for a fire?' 'Fire comes from the moon's mountains: when she is cold, I'll carry her up to a peak and place her on the edge of a crater.' 'Oh, how uncomfortable she'll be there! And her clothes will wear out: how will she get new ones?' Mr. Rochester pretended to be stumped. 'Hmm,' he mused. 'What would you suggest, Adèle? Use your imagination for a solution. How about a white or pink cloud for a dress, do you think? And one could cut a lovely scarf from a rainbow.' 'She's much better off as she is,' Adèle concluded after thinking for a bit; 'besides, she would get tired of living with just you on the moon. If I were mademoiselle, I would never agree to go with you.' 'She has agreed; she has given her word.' 'But you can't get her there; there's no path to the moon: it's all air; and neither you nor she can fly.' 'Adèle, look at that field.' We were now outside the gates of Thornfield, riding smoothly along the level road to Millcote, where the recent thunderstorm had settled the dust, and the low hedges and tall trees lining both sides sparkled green and refreshed by the rain. 'In that field, Adèle, I was walking late one evening about two weeks ago—the night of the day you helped me make hay in the orchard fields; and, tired from raking the cut grass, I sat down to rest on a stile; and there I took out a small book and a pencil and began to write about a misfortune that happened to me long ago and a hope I had for happy future days. I was writing very quickly, even though the light was fading from the page, when something came up the path and stopped six feet away from me. I looked at it. It was small with a delicate veil on its head. I motioned for it to come closer; it soon stood beside my knee. I never spoke to it, and it never spoke to me, in actual words; but I understood its eyes, and it understood mine; and our silent conversation went like this—'It was a fairy, it said, and had come from Elf-land; and its purpose was to make me happy. I had to go with it away from the ordinary world to a secluded place—like the moon, for instance—and it nodded its head towards the crescent moon, visible above Hay-hill. It described the pearly cave and silver valley where we could live. I said I would like to go but pointed out, just as you did to me, that I had no wings to fly.'Oh,' the fairy replied, 'that doesn't matter! Here is a magical object that will remove all difficulties;' and she held out a beautiful gold ring. 'Put it,' she said, 'on the fourth finger of my left hand, and I am yours, and you are mine; and we will leave earth and create our own paradise up there.' She nodded again towards the moon. The ring, Adèle, is in my trouser pocket, disguised as a coin; but I intend to change it back to a ring soon.' 'But what does mademoiselle have to do with it? I don't care about the fairy; you said it was mademoiselle you would take to the moon?' 'Mademoiselle is a fairy,' he said, whispering conspiratorially. At this, I told her to pay no attention to his teasing; and she, for her part, displayed a deep sense of genuine French skepticism, calling Mr. Rochester 'a true liar' and assuring him that she put no stock whatsoever in his 'fairy tales,' adding that 'besides, there were no fairies, and even if there were,' she was certain they would never appear to him, nor ever give him rings, or offer to live with him on the moon. The hour spent in Millcote was quite stressful for me. Mr. Rochester insisted I go to a specific silk shop; there I was instructed to choose half a dozen dresses. I disliked the task intensely and requested permission to postpone it, but no—it had to be done then. Through urgent whispered pleas, I managed to reduce the number from six to two; however, he declared he would choose these himself. I watched anxiously as his gaze swept over the bright fabrics; he settled on a luxurious silk of the most vibrant amethyst colour and a magnificent pink satin. I told him in a new series of whispers that he might as well buy me a gold dress and a silver bonnet at once, as I would certainly never dare to wear his selections. With immense difficulty, as he was as stubborn as a rock, I persuaded him to exchange them for a modest black satin and a pearl-grey silk. 'It's acceptable for now,' he said, 'but I will yet see you sparkling like a flower garden.' I was thrilled to get him out of the silk shop and then out of a jeweller's. The more he bought for me, the more my face felt hot with a sense of irritation and humiliation. As we got back into the carriage and I leaned back, feeling feverish and exhausted, I remembered something I had completely forgotten in the rush of events, both good and bad—the letter from my uncle, John Eyre, to Mrs. Reed, stating his intention to adopt me and make me his heir. 'It truly would be a relief,' I thought, 'if I had even a small independent income. I can never bear being dressed up like a doll by Mr. Rochester or sitting like a second Danaë with a shower of gold constantly falling around me. I will write to Madeira the moment I get home and tell my uncle John I am going to be married and to whom. If only I had the prospect of someday bringing Mr. Rochester an increase in fortune, I could better endure being supported by him now.' And somewhat eased by this thought (which I did not fail to act upon that very day), I dared once more to meet the gaze of my master and lover, which persistently sought mine, although I turned away both my face and my eyes. He smiled; and I thought his smile was like one a sultan might, in a happy and affectionate moment, give to a slave his gold and jewels had made wealthy. I squeezed his hand, which was constantly reaching for mine, forcefully, and pushed it back towards him, red from the intense pressure.",
          "paraphrase_gpt-4.1-2025-04-14": "I was becoming more and more annoyed when, fortunately, Adèle appeared, asking excitedly to join the trip to Millcote. She wanted me to plead her case since Mr. Rochester refused, despite there being space in the carriage. I promised to ask, eager to escape a somber companion. The carriage was ready, and Mr. Rochester was pacing nearby while Pilot, his dog, moved with him. I asked if Adèle could join us. He refused, saying he only wanted my company, not Adèle's, and insisted she would be a burden. Discouraged by Mrs. Fairfax’s cautions, I felt unsure and powerless but was about to comply when Mr. Rochester noticed my changed expression. He asked if Adèle’s exclusion upset me, and when I said I’d prefer for her to come, he quickly sent her to fetch her bonnet. He brushed off the disruption, telling me soon I would be his for life.\n\nOnce Adèle returned and was seated in the carriage, she gratefully kissed me, then sat away from him, too intimidated to speak. I suggested she sit by me, expecting she might bother him, and he agreed, passing her over with mock annoyance but a smile. Adèle asked if she was to go to school alone. Rochester replied she was, as he intended to take me to the moon so we could live together in solitude, inventing an imaginative tale about how we’d survive with manna for food and fire from lunar volcanoes. Adèle, unconvinced, thought my life would be uncomfortable there and declared that, in my position, she wouldn’t agree to go.\n\nRochester asserted I had already promised, but Adèle pointed out that it was impossible to reach the moon. Changing the subject, Rochester pointed out a field as we drove out of Thornfield, recounting an evening when he rested there and imagined a fairy offering to make him happy if he placed a ring on her finger—a thinly-veiled metaphor for our relationship. Adèle, skeptical, dismissed his story, insisting there were no fairies and none would consort with him.\n\nOur time in Millcote was taxing for me. Mr. Rochester insisted I pick out six new dresses at a silk store; I protested and persuaded him to settle on two, though he insisted on choosing. He selected flashy fabrics, but I convinced him, after some effort, to switch to more modest colors. The shopping ordeal continued with jewelry, and as I sat exhausted in the carriage afterward, I remembered my uncle John Eyre’s intention of adopting me and leaving me an inheritance. The thought cheered me, as I disliked feeling like a dressed-up doll or a passive recipient of Rochester’s generosity. Planning to write to my uncle once home, I felt somewhat lighter and dared to meet Rochester’s affectionate gaze. He smiled in a way that made me feel both cherished and subordinate, so I squeezed his hand fiercely, expressing my intense feelings."

You will stipulate, I see, for peculiar terms—what will they be?”\n“I only want an easy mind, sir; not crushed by crowded obligations. Do you remember what you said of Céline Varens?—of the diamonds, the cashmeres you gave her? I will not be your English Céline Varens. I shall continue to act as Adèle’s governess; by that I shall earn my board and lodging, and thirty pounds a year besides. I’ll furnish my own wardrobe out of that money, and you shall give me nothing but—”\n“Well, but what?”\n“Your regard; and if I give you mine in return, that debt will be quit.”\n“Well, for cool native impudence and pure innate pride, you haven’t your equal,” said he. We were now approaching Thornfield. “Will it please you to dine with me to-day?” he asked, as we re-entered the gates.\n“No, thank you, sir.”\n“And what for, ‘no, thank you?’ if one may inquire.”\n“I never have dined with you, sir: and I see no reason why I should now: till—”\n“Till what? You delight in half-phrases.”\n“Till I can’t help it.”\n“Do you suppose I eat like an ogre or a ghoul, that you dread being the companion of my repast?”\n“I have formed no supposition on the subject, sir; but I want to go on as usual for another month.”\n“You will give up your governessing slavery at once.”\n“Indeed, begging your pardon, sir, I shall not. I shall just go on with it as usual. I shall keep out of your way all day, as I have been accustomed to do: you may send for me in the evening, when you feel disposed to see me, and I’ll come then; but at no other time.”\n“I want a smoke, Jane, or a pinch of snuff, to comfort me under all this, ‘pour me donner une contenance,’ as Adèle would say; and unfortunately I have neither my cigar-case, nor my snuff-box. But listen—whisper. It is your time now, little tyrant, but it will be mine presently; and when once I have fairly seized you, to have and to hold, I’ll just—figuratively speaking—attach you to a chain like this” (touching his watch-guard). “Yes, bonny wee thing, I’ll wear you in my bosom, lest my jewel I should tyne.”\nHe said this as he helped me to alight from the carriage, and while he afterwards lifted out Adèle, I entered the house, and made good my retreat upstairs.",

She suggested he use the expensive pearl-grey silk for a dressing-gown and the black satin for waistcoats instead. Rochester chuckled, finding her reaction delightful and unique. He exclaimed he wouldn't trade her, his \"one little English girl,\" for the Grand Turk's entire collection of women, regardless of their beauty. Jane, irritated by the Eastern allusion, insisted she would not serve as a substitute for a seraglio. She told him if he was interested in such an arrangement, he should immediately go to the bazaars in Istanbul and spend his apparently surplus money on purchasing slaves. Rochester then asked what she would do while he was acquiring his 'tons of flesh' and 'assortment of black eyes'. Jane responded that she would prepare to become a missionary preaching liberty to the enslaved, including his potential harem inmates. She vowed to get into the harem, incite a mutiny, and ensure that he, the powerful 'three-tailed bashaw', would be quickly captured and held until he agreed to sign a charter more liberal than any ever granted by a despot, promising not to release him until he did. Rochester claimed he would gladly be at her mercy. Jane stated she would show him none if he begged with that look in his eye, as she would be certain he would break any forced agreement the moment he was free. Rochester, surprised, asked what she truly wanted, suggesting she would demand a private wedding ceremony in addition to the public one and specific unusual terms. Jane explained her only desire was peace of mind, free from excessive obligations. She reminded him of his past comments about Céline Varens and the luxurious gifts he gave her, declaring she would not be his 'English Céline Varens'. She intended to remain Adèle's governess, earning her board, lodging, and thirty pounds a year, which she would use for her own clothes. She insisted he give her nothing but his respect, offering hers in return as a balanced exchange. Rochester remarked on her incredible ",

Isn't she unique? Isn't she lively? I wouldn't trade this one English girl for all the beauties in the Grand Turk's harem!\"\n\nHis mention of the East annoyed me again. \"Don't think for a second that I replace a harem,\" I said. \"If that’s what you want, go off to the markets of Istanbul and spend your extra money on as many slaves as you can buy.\"\n\n\"And what will you do, Jane, while I'm off buying all that beauty?\"\n\n\"I'll get ready to become a missionary and go preach freedom to your enslaved harem women.

If you did, I'd be sure the minute you were free, you'd break whatever promise you made while under pressure.\"\n\n\"Jane, what more do you want? I think you'll make me go through a private wedding ceremony on top of the public one.

          "text_segment": "He duly summoned me to his presence in the evening. I had prepared an occupation for him; for I was determined not to spend the whole time in a tête-à-tête conversation. I remembered his fine voice; I knew he liked to sing—good singers generally do. I was no vocalist myself, and, in his fastidious judgment, no musician, either; but I delighted in listening when the performance was good. No sooner had twilight, that hour of romance, began to lower her blue and starry banner over the lattice, than I rose, opened the piano, and entreated him, for the love of heaven, to give me a song. He said I was a capricious witch, and that he would rather sing another time; but I averred that no time was like the present.\n“Did I like his voice?” he asked.\n“Very much.” I was not fond of pampering that susceptible vanity of his; but for once, and from motives of expediency, I would e’en soothe and stimulate it.\n“Then, Jane, you must play the accompaniment.”\n“Very well, sir, I will try.”\nI did try, but was presently swept off the stool and denominated “a little bungler.” Being pushed unceremoniously to one side—which was precisely what I wished—he usurped my place, and proceeded to accompany himself: for he could play as well as sing. I hied me to the window-recess. And while I sat there and looked out on the still trees and dim lawn, to a sweet air was sung in mellow tones the following strain:—\n“The truest love that ever heart\nFelt at its kindled core,\nDid through each vein, in quickened start,\nThe tide of being pour.\n\nHer coming was my hope each day,\nHer parting was my pain;\nThe chance that did her steps delay\nWas ice in every vein.\n\nI dreamed it would be nameless bliss,\nAs I loved, loved to be;\nAnd to this object did I press\nAs blind as eagerly.\n\nBut wide as pathless was the space\nThat lay our lives between,\nAnd dangerous as the foamy race\nOf ocean-surges green.\n\nAnd haunted as a robber-path\nThrough wilderness or wood;\nFor Might and Right, and Woe and Wrath,\nBetween our spirits stood.\n\nI dangers dared; I hindrance scorned;\nI omens did defy:\nWhatever menaced, harassed, warned,\nI passed impetuous by.\n\nOn sped my rainbow, fast as light;\nI flew as in a dream;\nFor glorious rose upon my sight\nThat child of Shower and Gleam.\n\nStill bright on clouds of suffering dim\nShines that soft, solemn joy;\nNor care I now, how dense and grim\nDisasters gather nigh.\n\nI care not in this moment sweet,\nThough all I have rushed o’er\nShould come on pinion, strong and fleet,\nProclaiming vengeance sore:\n\nThough haughty Hate should strike me down,\nRight, bar approach to me,\nAnd grinding Might, with furious frown,\nSwear endless enmity.\n\nMy love has placed her little hand\nWith noble faith in mine,\nAnd vowed that wedlock’s sacred band\nOur nature shall entwine.\n\nMy love has sworn, with sealing kiss,\nWith me to live—to die;\nI have at last my nameless bliss.\nAs I love—loved am I!”\nHe rose and came towards me, and I saw his face all kindled, and his full falcon-eye flashing, and tenderness and passion in every lineament. I quailed momentarily—then I rallied. Soft scene, daring demonstration, I would not have; and I stood in peril of both: a weapon of defence must be prepared—I whetted my tongue: as he reached me, I asked with asperity, “whom he was going to marry now?”\n“That was a strange question to be put by his darling Jane.”\n“Indeed! I considered it a very natural and necessary one: he had talked of his future wife dying with him. What did he mean by such a pagan idea? I had no intention of dying with him—he might depend on that.”\n“Oh, all he longed, all he prayed for, was that I might live with him! Death was not for such as I.”\n“Indeed it was: I had as good a right to die when my time came as he had: but I should bide that time, and not be hurried away in a suttee.”\n“Would I forgive him for the selfish idea, and prove my pardon by a reconciling kiss?”\n“No: I would rather be excused.”\nHere I heard myself apostrophised as a “hard little thing;” and it was added, “any other woman would have been melted to marrow at hearing such stanzas crooned in her praise.”\nI assured him I was naturally hard—very flinty, and that he would often find me so; and that, moreover, I was determined to show him divers rugged points in my character before the ensuing four weeks elapsed: he should know fully what sort of a bargain he had made, while there was yet time to rescind it.\n“Would I be quiet and talk rationally?”\n“I would be quiet if he liked, and as to talking rationally, I flattered myself I was doing that now.”\nHe fretted, pished, and pshawed. “Very good,” I thought; “you may fume and fidget as you please: but this is the best plan to pursue with you, I am certain. I like you more than I can say; but I’ll not sink into a bathos of sentiment: and with this needle of repartee I’ll keep you from the edge of the gulf too; and, moreover, maintain by its pungent aid that distance between you and myself most conducive to our real mutual advantage.”\nFrom less to more, I worked him up to considerable irritation; then, after he had retired, in dudgeon, quite to the other end of the room, I got up, and saying, “I wish you good-night, sir,” in my natural and wonted respectful manner, I slipped out by the side-door and got away.\nThe system thus entered on, I pursued during the whole season of probation; and with the best success. He was kept, to be sure, rather cross and crusty; but on the whole I could see he was excellently entertained, and that a lamb-like submission and turtle-dove sensibility, while fostering his despotism more, would have pleased his judgment, satisfied his common-sense, and even suited his taste less.\nIn other people’s presence I was, as formerly, deferential and quiet; any other line of conduct being uncalled for: it was only in the evening conferences I thus thwarted and afflicted him. He continued to send for me punctually the moment the clock struck seven; though when I appeared before him now, he had no such honeyed terms as “love” and “darling” on his lips: the best words at my service were “provoking puppet,” “malicious elf,” “sprite,” “changeling,” &c. For caresses, too, I now got grimaces; for a pressure of the hand, a pinch on the arm; for a kiss on the cheek, a severe tweak of the ear. It was all right: at present I decidedly preferred these fierce favours to anything more tender. Mrs. Fairfax, I saw, approved me: her anxiety on my account vanished; therefore I was certain I did well. Meantime, Mr. Rochester affirmed I was wearing him to skin and bone, and threatened awful vengeance for my present conduct at some period fast coming. I laughed in my sleeve at his menaces. “I can keep you in reasonable check now,” I reflected; “and I don’t doubt to be able to do it hereafter: if one expedient loses its virtue, another must be devised.”\nYet after all my task was not an easy one; often I would rather have pleased than teased him. My future husband was becoming to me my whole world; and more than the world: almost my hope of heaven. He stood between me and every thought of religion, as an eclipse intervenes between man and the broad sun. I could not, in those days, see God for His creature: of whom I had made an idol.",
          "paraphrase_gemini-2.5-flash-preview-04-17": "In the evening, he duly requested my presence. I had planned something beforehand, as I didn't want to spend the entire time just chatting with him. I recalled his pleasant singing voice and knew he enjoyed performing—as good singers usually do. I wasn't a singer myself, nor did he consider me a musician based on his high standards, but I truly enjoyed listening to skilled performers. As twilight, the romantic hour, began casting its soft, starry gloom over the windows, I stood up, opened the piano, and implored him to sing for me, for goodness sake. He grumbled that I was a whimsical sort and that he'd prefer to sing later, but I insisted that the present moment was the only suitable time. 'Did I like his voice?' he inquired. 'Very much,' I replied. I wasn't keen on indulging his susceptible vanity, but just this once, and out of practical consideration, I decided to soothe and encourage it. 'Then, Jane,' he said, 'you must accompany me.' 'Certainly, sir, I'll attempt it,' I answered. I did try, but he quickly pushed me off the stool, calling me 'a clumsy novice.' After unceremoniously shoving me aside—which was exactly my goal—he took my spot and began accompanying himself, as he was skilled at playing as well as singing. I moved quickly to the window alcove. While I sat there, gazing out at the still trees and dimly lit lawn, he sang the following verse in smooth tones to a sweet melody: \n\n'The deepest love a heart could feel\nWhen it first stirred within,\nFlowed through each vein, a vibrant reel,\nBringing life's tide rushing in.\n\nHer arrival brought hope each day,\nHer departure caused me pain;\nAny chance that caused her delay\nWas ice in every vein.\n\nI dreamed of a bliss beyond compare,\nTo be loved, as I did love;\nAnd towards this aim I pressed with care,\nBlindly, like a driven dove.\n\nBut vast and trackless was the space\nThat kept our lives apart,\nAnd perilous as the churning race\nOf green ocean's beating heart.\n\nAnd dangerous as a robber's trail\nThrough forest deep or wild;\nFor Strength and Justice, Grief and Ire,\nBetween our spirits piled.\n\nI faced down risks; scorned every bar;\nDefied all ominous signs:\nWhatever threatened, vexed, or warned,\nI rushed past their confines.\n\nOn flew my hope, a rainbow bright;\nI soared as in a dream;\nFor glorious dawned upon my sight\nThat child of Sun and Gleam.\n\nStill brightly on dim clouds of woe\nShines that calm, deep delight;\nNor do I care, however so\nDisasters gather close tonight.\n\nI do not fear this moment sweet,\nThough all I've overcome\nShould come with wings, both strong and fleet,\nSeeking harsh vengeance to some:\n\nThough proud Hate should strike me down low,\nJustice bar my way to bliss,\nAnd crushing Might, with furious brow,\nSwear endless enmity on this.\n\nMy love has placed her small hand here\nWith noble trust in mine,\nAnd vowed that wedlock's bond so dear\nOur beings shall entwine.\n\nMy love has sworn, with sealing kiss,\nWith me to live—to die;\nI have at last my longed-for bliss.\nAs I love—loved am I!'\n\nHe finished and approached me, his face alight with emotion, his intense falcon-like eyes flashing, showing tenderness and passion in every feature. I flinched for a moment, then regained my composure. I was determined not to have a soft scene or a bold display of affection, and I was facing the risk of both. I needed a defensive strategy—I sharpened my wit. As he reached me, I asked sharply, 'So, who are you planning to marry now?'\n\nHe found it odd that his 'darling Jane' would ask such a question. 'Really!' I retorted, 'I thought it was a perfectly natural and necessary query. You mentioned your future wife dying with you. What did you mean by such a pagan notion? I certainly have no intention of dying with you—you can be sure of that.'\n\n'Oh,' he exclaimed, 'all I desire, all I pray for, is that you would live with me! Death is not for someone like you.'\n\n'Indeed it is,' I countered. 'I have just as much right to die when it's my time as you do; but I shall wait for that time and not be rushed into a sacrificial death like a suttee.'\n\n'Would I forgive him for the self-centered thought,' he asked, 'and show my forgiveness with a kiss of reconciliation?'\n\n'No,' I replied, 'I would rather not.'\n\nAt this point, he called me a 'stubborn little creature' and added that 'any other woman would have been completely melted to the core by hearing such verses sung in her praise.'\n\nI assured him that I was inherently tough—very much like flint—and that he would find me so often. Furthermore, I was resolved to reveal various difficult aspects of my character before the next four weeks were over. He would know exactly what kind of commitment he had made while there was still an opportunity to withdraw from it.\n\n'Would I please be quiet and speak reasonably?' he pressed.\n\n'I will be quiet if you wish,' I replied, 'and as for speaking reasonably, I believe I am doing so now.'\n\nHe showed signs of annoyance, muttering dismissively. 'Excellent,' I thought to myself. 'You may fume and fidget as much as you like, but this, I am convinced, is the best way to handle you. I care for you more than I can express, but I refuse to descend into sentimental melodrama. And with this sharp wit of mine, I will prevent you from falling into that emotional pit too; and what's more, with its biting effectiveness, I will maintain that distance between us that is most beneficial for both our true interests.'\n\nGradually, I provoked him further until he was quite irritated. Then, after he had retreated to the opposite end of the room in a huff, I got up, said, 'Good night, sir,' in my usual respectful tone, and quietly slipped out through the side door.\n\nI continued this strategy throughout the entire trial period, and it proved very successful. It kept him somewhat cross and difficult, certainly, but overall, I could see he was thoroughly entertained, and that a meek submission and tender emotion, while possibly gratifying his need for control more, would have pleased his sense of judgment, satisfied his common sense, and even suited his taste less.\n\nIn the presence of others, I remained, as before, respectful and quiet, as any other behavior was unnecessary. It was only during our private evening meetings that I deliberately opposed and annoyed him. He continued to summon me promptly the moment the clock struck seven, although when I appeared before him now, his lips no longer uttered sweet endearments like 'love' and 'darling.' The best words he had for me were 'irritating puppet,' 'mean-spirited imp,' 'spirit,' 'changeling,' and so on. Instead of gentle caresses, I now received scowls; instead of a hand squeeze, a pinch on the arm; instead of a kiss on the cheek, a sharp tug on the ear. This was perfectly acceptable; at that point, I clearly preferred these rough signs of favour to anything more tender. I could see that Mrs. Fairfax approved of me; her worry about me disappeared, so I was certain I was doing the right thing. Meanwhile, Mr. Rochester claimed I was wearing him down to skin and bone and threatened terrible retribution for my current behavior at some approaching time. I secretly found his threats amusing. 'I can keep you reasonably in check now,' I reflected, 'and I have no doubt I can do so in the future. If one method stops working, I will simply invent another.'\n\nYet, despite everything, my task was not easy. Often, I would have preferred to please him rather than provoke him. My future husband was becoming everything to me; more than the world itself, almost my hope of salvation. He stood between me and any thought of religious devotion, just as an eclipse comes between a person and the bright sun. In those days, I could not see God because of His creation, whom I had turned into an idol.",
          "paraphrase_gpt-4.1-2025-04-14": "He called for me in the evening as usual. Wanting to avoid an extended private conversation, I had thought of something to occupy him. I remembered his excellent singing voice and his fondness for performing, though I wasn’t a singer myself and he didn’t consider me much of a musician, I still enjoyed listening to good music. As dusk began, casting its romantic light, I opened the piano and asked him to sing for me. He complained and called me unpredictable, saying he’d rather sing another time, but I insisted there was no better moment than now.\n\nHe inquired whether I liked his singing, to which I replied that I did. I usually avoided flattering his ego, but this time I did so intentionally. He then told me to play the piano accompaniment. I agreed to try, but he soon deemed me incompetent and moved me aside, which was what I wanted. He then sat at the piano himself, as he could play and sing, and I went to sit by the window. While I looked out at the quiet trees and dim garden, he sang the following song with a sweet voice:\n\n[Poem omitted for brevity]\n\nAfter finishing, he approached me, his face animated and passionate, which made me briefly uneasy before I composed myself. I didn’t want any romantic scene and felt the need to defend myself with words. As he reached me, I sharply asked who he intended to marry now. He said it was odd for me, his ‘darling Jane,’ to ask such a thing. I replied that it was a perfectly reasonable question, as he had mentioned wishing his future wife would die with him, which I found a strange notion—I did not intend to die with him.\n\nHe declared all he wished for was that I would live with him. Death, he said, was not for someone like me. I retorted that I had as much right to die as he did, but I would do so only when the time was right, not in some dramatic fashion. He asked for forgiveness for his selfish idea and requested a kiss as proof. I refused, preferring to be excused. He called me a ‘hard little thing’ and noted that any other woman would have been deeply moved by his song. I told him I was indeed hard, and he would find more of such tough qualities in me over the next few weeks, so he would fully know what kind of woman he was about to marry while he still had time to reconsider.\n\nHe asked if I would calm down and speak sensibly. I said I could be quiet if he wanted, and thought I was being rational. He became irritated, but I felt confident that this was the best way to handle him. I cared for him deeply, but I refused to fall into excessive sentimentality; instead, I used playful teasing to keep our relationship balanced and healthy.\n\nEventually, I provoked him to considerable annoyance, and when he sulked at the other end of the room, I politely wished him good night and made my exit. I continued this approach throughout our engagement, which proved successful. He was often irritable, but generally well entertained, and I believed that more submissive, sentimental behavior would not have suited him as well. Around others I remained respectful and quiet, but in private, I persisted in my more challenging ways. He still summoned me every evening at seven, but was now more likely to call me names like ‘provoking puppet’ or ‘sprite’ rather than ‘darling.’ His affection was expressed with mock sternness rather than tenderness, which I actually preferred. Mrs. Fairfax seemed satisfied with my behavior and no longer worried about me, assuring me I was proceeding wisely. Mr. Rochester claimed I was tormenting him and threatened retribution for my conduct, but I found this amusing and was confident in my ability to manage him in future.\n\nStill, it wasn’t always easy for me; I often wanted to please him rather than tease him. My feelings for my future husband grew so strong that he became the center of my world, eclipsing even my spiritual life. I found myself thinking of him rather than of God, as if he had become my idol."

Mr. Rochester had himself written the direction, “Mrs. Rochester, —— Hotel, London,” on each: I could not persuade myself to affix them, or to have them affixed. Mrs. Rochester! She did not exist: she would not be born till to-morrow, some time after eight o’clock A.M.; and I would wait to be assured she had come into the world alive before I assigned to her all that property. It was enough that in yonder closet, opposite my dressing-table, garments said to be hers had already displaced my black stuff Lowood frock and straw bonnet: for not to me appertained that suit of wedding raiment; the pearl-coloured robe, the vapoury veil pendent from the usurped portmanteau. I shut the closet to conceal the strange, wraith-like apparel it contained; which, at this evening hour—nine o’clock—gave out certainly a most ghostly shimmer through the shadow of my apartment. “I will leave you by yourself, white dream,” I said. “I am feverish: I hear the wind blowing: I will go out of doors and feel it.”",

There was no way to delay the approaching day—the wedding day—and all arrangements for its arrival were complete. I, at least, had finished everything I needed to do: my packed, locked, and tied trunks were lined up in a row along the wall of my little room. By this time tomorrow, they would be well on their way to London, and so, God willing, would I—or rather, not me, but a person called Jane Rochester, someone I didn't feel I knew yet. Only the address cards remained to be nailed on; the four small squares lay in the drawer. Mr. Rochester himself had written the address, “Mrs. Rochester, —— Hotel, London,” on each one; I couldn't persuade myself to attach them, or to have them attached. Mrs. Rochester! She wasn't real; she wouldn't be born until sometime after eight o’clock tomorrow morning. I wanted to wait to be sure she had arrived in the world alive before assigning all that property to her. It was enough that in the wardrobe over there, opposite my dressing-table, garments said to be hers had already taken the place of my simple black Lowood frock and straw bonnet: that wedding outfit didn't belong to me—the pale gown, the light veil hanging from the wardrobe it had claimed. I shut the closet to hide the strange, spirit-like clothing it contained; which, at this hour of the evening—nine o’clock—certainly gave off a most spectral shimmer through the shadow in my apartment. “I will leave you by yourself, white vision,” I said. “I feel restless; I hear the wind blowing: I will go outside and feel it.”",

The wedding day was fast approaching and could not be delayed; everything for the event was now finished. I, for my part, had nothing left to organize—my luggage was packed, secured, and lined up along my bedroom wall. By this time tomorrow, the trunks would be on their way to London, and so, in a sense, would I—though it felt as if it wouldn’t be me, but a new person called Jane Rochester, whom I had yet to meet. Only the address labels remained to be attached; they sat in the drawer, four small cards, each inscribed by Mr. Rochester with “Mrs. Rochester, —— Hotel, London.” I couldn’t bring myself to put them on, or let anyone else do it. The title, “Mrs. Rochester,” didn’t feel real yet—it wouldn’t become true until after eight o'clock tomorrow morning, and I wanted to wait until that new identity was certain before claiming it. In my closet, the bridal clothes—intended for Mrs. Rochester—had taken the place of my old Lowood dress and straw hat; but I didn’t feel those wedding garments belonged to me. I closed the closet doors to hide the unfamiliar, spectral-looking clothes, which, in the dim light of nine o’clock in the evening, seemed to give off an eerie glow. “I’ll leave you alone, white dream,” I murmured. “I am restless—I hear the wind outside; I’ll go out and feel it.”"

Instead of subsiding as night drew on, it seemed to augment its rush and deepen its roar: the trees blew steadfastly one way, never writhing round, and scarcely tossing back their boughs once in an hour; so continuous was the strain bending their branchy heads northward—the clouds drifted from pole to pole, fast following, mass on mass: no glimpse of blue sky had been visible that July day.\nIt was not without a certain wild pleasure I ran before the wind, delivering my trouble of mind to the measureless air-torrent thundering through space. Descending the laurel walk, I faced the wreck of the chestnut-tree; it stood up black and riven: the trunk, split down the centre, gasped ghastly. The cloven halves were not broken from each other, for the firm base and strong roots kept them unsundered below; though community of vitality was destroyed—the sap could flow no more: their great boughs on each side were dead, and next winter’s tempests would be sure to fell one or both to earth: as yet, however, they might be said to form one tree—a ruin, but an entire ruin.\n“You did right to hold fast to each other,” I said: as if the monster-splinters were living things, and could hear me. “I think, scathed as you look, and charred and scorched, there must be a little sense of life in you yet, rising out of that adhesion at the faithful, honest roots: you will never have green leaves more—never more see birds making nests and singing idyls in your boughs; the time of pleasure and love is over with you: but you are not desolate: each of you has a comrade to sympathise with him in his decay.” As I looked up at them, the moon appeared momentarily in that part of the sky which filled their fissure; her disk was blood-red and half overcast; she seemed to throw on me one bewildered, dreary glance, and buried herself again instantly in the deep drift of cloud. The wind fell, for a second, round Thornfield; but far away over wood and water, poured a wild, melancholy wail: it was sad to listen to, and I ran off again.",
          "paraphrase_gemini-2.5-flash-preview-04-17": "Seeking refuge from the forceful and steady south wind that had been blowing all day without bringing rain, I went into the orchard. As evening approached, the wind didn't die down; instead, its intensity increased, and its noise grew louder. The trees consistently leaned in one direction, rarely twisting or tossing their branches back even once an hour, held under constant pressure that bent their heads towards the north. Clouds hurried across the sky from horizon to horizon, piling up rapidly; not a patch of blue had been visible on that July day.\n\nI found a strange, wild enjoyment in running ahead of the wind, releasing my mental distress into the vast, roaring current of air rushing through space. Walking down the laurel path, I came upon the remains of the chestnut tree. It stood stark, black, and torn apart; its trunk was split down the middle, gaping horribly. The two severed halves hadn't separated completely because the sturdy base and strong roots kept them connected below, though their shared life was gone—sap could no longer flow. Their large branches on either side were dead, and future winter storms would surely bring one or both crashing to the ground. However, for now, they still resembled a single tree—a ruin, but an intact ruin.\n\n\"You did well to hold onto each other,\" I commented, speaking as if the massive splinters were alive and could hear me. \"Despite how scarred, charred, and scorched you appear, I believe there's still a flicker of life in you, sustained by that connection at the loyal, firm roots. You'll never bear green leaves again, never again see birds building nests and singing peacefully in your branches; your time for joy and love is over. But you are not alone; each of you has a companion to share your decline.\" As I gazed up at them, the moon briefly appeared in the section of sky visible through the tree's split trunk. Its disk was blood-red and partly hidden by clouds; it seemed to cast a confused, desolate look at me before immediately disappearing back into the thick cloud cover. The wind momentarily calmed around Thornfield, but a wild, mournful cry echoed from a distance over woods and water. It was painful to hear, and I quickly ran off again.",

As night approached, instead of the wind calming down, it seemed to grow even more intense, making a deeper, more continuous noise. The trees were bent steadily in one direction, barely moving back, held under a constant strain that forced their branches northward. Clouds moved quickly overhead, covering the sky so completely that not a patch of blue was visible all day. Despite my troubles, there was a wild sort of thrill in running with the wind and letting it carry away my worries. Walking down the laurel path, I came face to face with the damaged chestnut tree; it stood upright but was split down the middle, looking grim and ghostly. The two halves remained connected at the base because of their strong roots, even though their shared life had ended—the sap no longer flowed. The heavy limbs on each side were dead and certain to fall in the coming winter’s storms; yet, for now, they still formed one complete, if ruined, tree.\n\nI spoke to them as if they were alive: \"You did well to cling to each other,\" I said. \"Though you look scorched and lifeless, there must still be some sense of life coming from your faithful roots. You will never have green leaves again, nor see birds nest or hear their songs in your boughs; your days of happiness and love are over. But you are not alone: each of you has a companion to share in your decline.\" As I looked up, the moon briefly emerged in the gap between the two halves of the tree, its face red and partly hidden, casting a sorrowful glance my way before vanishing behind thick clouds. For a moment, the wind quieted around Thornfield, but far off in the distance, it made a wild, mournful sound. The sadness of it drove me to run on."

I placed his arm-chair by the chimney-corner: I wheeled the table near it: I let down the curtain, and had the candles brought in ready for lighting. More restless than ever, when I had completed these arrangements I could not sit still, nor even remain in the house: a little time-piece in the room and the old clock in the hall simultaneously struck ten.\n“How late it grows!” I said. “I will run down to the gates: it is moonlight at intervals; I can see a good way on the road. He may be coming now, and to meet him will save some minutes of suspense.”\nThe wind roared high in the great trees which embowered the gates; but the road as far as I could see, to the right hand and the left, was all still and solitary: save for the shadows of clouds crossing it at intervals as the moon looked out, it was but a long pale line, unvaried by one moving speck.\nA puerile tear dimmed my eye while I looked—a tear of disappointment and impatience; ashamed of it, I wiped it away. I lingered; the moon shut herself wholly within her chamber, and drew close her curtain of dense cloud: the night grew dark; rain came driving fast on the gale.\n“I wish he would come! I wish he would come!” I exclaimed, seized with hypochondriac foreboding. I had expected his arrival before tea; now it was dark: what could keep him? Had an accident happened? The event of last night again recurred to me. I interpreted it as a warning of disaster. I feared my hopes were too bright to be realised; and I had enjoyed so much bliss lately that I imagined my fortune had passed its meridian, and must now decline.\n“Well, I cannot return to the house,” I thought; “I cannot sit by the fireside, while he is abroad in inclement weather: better tire my limbs than strain my heart; I will go forward and meet him.”\nI set out; I walked fast, but not far: ere I had measured a quarter of a mile, I heard the tramp of hoofs; a horseman came on, full gallop; a dog ran by his side. Away with evil presentiment! It was he: here he was, mounted on Mesrour, followed by Pilot. He saw me; for the moon had opened a blue field in the sky, and rode in it watery bright: he took his hat off, and waved it round his head. I now ran to meet him.\n“There!” he exclaimed, as he stretched out his hand and bent from the saddle: “You can’t do without me, that is evident. Step on my boot-toe; give me both hands: mount!”\nI obeyed: joy made me agile: I sprang up before him.",

I moved his armchair near the fireplace, pulled the table closer, closed the curtain, and had the candles brought in, ready to be lit. Despite having finished these preparations, I felt more agitated than ever and couldn't stay still or even remain indoors. A small clock in the room and the old hall clock chimed ten simultaneously. \"It's getting so late!\" I thought. \"I'll hurry down to the gates; the moonlight is visible occasionally, and I can see quite a distance along the road. He might be coming now, and meeting him will shorten this time of anticipation.\" The wind howled loudly through the large trees surrounding the gates, but the road, as far as I could see in both directions, was quiet and empty. Apart from the shadows of clouds passing over it when the moon briefly appeared, it was just a long, pale line with no sign of movement. A childish tear of disappointment and impatience welled up as I watched; feeling ashamed, I wiped it away. I lingered. The moon completely hid herself behind a dense curtain of clouds, and the night grew dark. Rain began to fall heavily, driven by the wind. \"Oh, I wish he would come! I wish he would come!\" I cried out, seized by anxious predictions. I had expected him before tea; now it was dark. What could be detaining him? Had something happened? The incident from the previous night came back to me, and I saw it as a sign of misfortune. I feared my hopes were too high to be fulfilled and felt that, after so much recent happiness, my good fortune must have peaked and was now destined to decline. \"Well, I can't go back inside,\" I decided. \"I can't sit by the fire while he's out in this bad weather. It's better to tire my legs than suffer with anxiety; I will go forward and meet him.\" I started walking quickly, but not far. Before I had gone a quarter of a mile, I heard the sound of hooves. A horseman approached at a full gallop, with a dog running alongside. Away with negative thoughts! It was him. Here he was, riding Mesrour and followed by Pilot. He saw me, as the moon had revealed a clear, watery-bright patch of sky and shone from it. He took off his hat and waved it above his head. I ran towards him. \"There!\" he exclaimed, reaching out his hand and leaning down from the saddle. \"It's clear you can't manage without me.

This is you, who has been as hard to catch as an eel this last month, and as sharp as a wild rose bush? I couldn't get near you without being hurt; and now it seems I've found a lost young sheep in my arms. You strayed from the group to find your protector, didn't you, Jane?\" \"I wanted you: but don't brag. We've arrived at Thornfield now: let me get off.\" He helped me down onto the walkway. While John took his horse, and he followed me into the entrance hall, he told me to hurry and put on dry clothes, and then come back to him in the library; and he stopped me as I moved towards the stairs to get a promise that I wouldn't take long: and I wasn't long; I returned to him in five minutes. I discovered him eating his evening meal.",

He paused in his happiness to ask, “But is there something wrong, Janet, that you come out to meet me so late? Is something amiss?”\n“No, but I was afraid you’d never arrive. I couldn't stand waiting inside for you, especially with this storm.”\n“Yes, the weather! You’re soaked through; here, let me wrap my cloak around you. But you feel rather warm, Jane—your face and hand are burning. Are you sure nothing’s wrong?”\n“Nothing now; I don’t feel scared or upset anymore.”\n“So, you were both?”\n“A little. I’ll explain everything soon, sir, though I’m sure you’ll laugh at me.”\n“I’ll laugh plenty once tomorrow is over; until then, I can’t risk it. My prize isn’t secure yet. You’ve been so elusive and prickly this past month—it was impossible to touch you without being stung. Yet now, it’s as if I’ve picked up a lost lamb. Did you wander away to find your shepherd, Jane?”\n“I wanted you; but don’t brag. We're at Thornfield now, so let me get out.”\nHe set me down on the pavement. As John took his horse, he followed me inside and told me to hurry and change into dry clothes, then come to him in the library.

When we were again alone, I stirred the fire, and then took a low seat at my master’s knee.\n“It is near midnight,” I said.\n“Yes: but remember, Jane, you promised to wake with me the night before my wedding.”\n“I did; and I will keep my promise, for an hour or two at least: I have no wish to go to bed.”\n“Are all your arrangements complete?”\n“All, sir.”\n“And on my part likewise,” he returned, “I have settled everything; and we shall leave Thornfield to-morrow, within half-an-hour after our return from church.”\n“Very well, sir.”\n“With what an extraordinary smile you uttered that word—‘very well,’ Jane! What a bright spot of colour you have on each cheek! and how strangely your eyes glitter! Are you well?”\n“I believe I am.”\n“Believe! What is the matter? Tell me what you feel.”\n“I could not, sir: no words could tell you what I feel. I wish this present hour would never end: who knows with what fate the next may come charged?”\n“This is hypochondria, Jane. You have been over-excited, or over-fatigued.”\n“Do you, sir, feel calm and happy?”\n“Calm?—no: but happy—to the heart’s core.”\nI looked up at him to read the signs of bliss in his face: it was ardent and flushed.\n“Give me your confidence, Jane,” he said: “relieve your mind of any weight that oppresses it, by imparting it to me. What do you fear?—that I shall not prove a good husband?”\n“It is the idea farthest from my thoughts.”\n“Are you apprehensive of the new sphere you are about to enter?—of the new life into which you are passing?”\n“No.”\n“You puzzle me, Jane: your look and tone of sorrowful audacity perplex and pain me. I want an explanation.”\n“Then, sir, listen. You were from home last night?”\n“I was: I know that; and you hinted a while ago at something which had happened in my absence:—nothing, probably, of consequence; but, in short, it has disturbed you. Let me hear it. Mrs. Fairfax has said something, perhaps? or you have overheard the servants talk?—your sensitive self-respect has been wounded?”\n“No, sir.” It struck twelve—I waited till the time-piece had concluded its silver chime, and the clock its hoarse, vibrating stroke, and then I proceeded.",

Everything in life feels unreal.”\n“Except me,” he said. “I am real enough—touch me.”\n“You, sir, are the most like a ghost of all,” I countered. “You are just a dream.”\nHe held out his hand and laughed. “Is this a dream?” he asked, putting it close to my eyes. His hand was rounded, strong, and muscular, just like his long, powerful arm.\n“Yes, even though I am touching it, it feels like a dream,” I said, moving it away from my face. “Sir, have you finished your meal?”\n“Yes, Jane.”\nI rang the bell to have the tray removed.

Tell me how you feel.”\n“Sir, I couldn’t. No words could express what I feel. I wish this moment could last forever. Who knows what fate the next hour might bring?”\n“This is just nerves, Jane,” he said. “You’ve been overly stimulated or overworked.”\n“Sir, do you feel calm and content?” I asked.\n“Calm?—no,” he admitted. “But happy—deeply happy.”\nI looked up at him, searching his face for signs of his great happiness. It was intensely flushed and passionate.\n“Trust me, Jane,” he urged. “Relieve the weight on your mind by sharing it with me.

I need an explanation.”\n“Then, sir, please listen,” I began. “Were you away from home last night?”\n“I was,” he confirmed. “I know that, and you hinted earlier about something that happened while I was gone—probably nothing major, but it has upset you.

No, sir, don’t caress me now—let me talk undisturbed. Yesterday I trusted well in Providence, and believed that events were working together for your good and mine: it was a fine day, if you recollect—the calmness of the air and sky forbade apprehensions respecting your safety or comfort on your journey. I walked a little while on the pavement after tea, thinking of you; and I beheld you in imagination so near me, I scarcely missed your actual presence. I thought of the life that lay before me—your life, sir—an existence more expansive and stirring than my own: as much more so as the depths of the sea to which the brook runs are than the shallows of its own strait channel. I wondered why moralists call this world a dreary wilderness: for me it blossomed like a rose. Just at sunset, the air turned cold and the sky cloudy: I went in, Sophie called me upstairs to look at my wedding-dress, which they had just brought; and under it in the box I found your present—the veil which, in your princely extravagance, you sent for from London: resolved, I suppose, since I would not have jewels, to cheat me into accepting something as costly. I smiled as I unfolded it, and devised how I would tease you about your aristocratic tastes, and your efforts to masque your plebeian bride in the attributes of a peeress. I thought how I would carry down to you the square of unembroidered blond I had myself prepared as a covering for my low-born head, and ask if that was not good enough for a woman who could bring her husband neither fortune, beauty, nor connections. I saw plainly how you would look; and heard your impetuous republican answers, and your haughty disavowal of any necessity on your part to augment your wealth, or elevate your standing, by marrying either a purse or a coronet.”\n“How well you read me, you witch!” interposed Mr. Rochester: “but what did you find in the veil besides its embroidery? Did you find poison, or a dagger, that you look so mournful now?”\n“No, no, sir; besides the delicacy and richness of the fabric, I found nothing save Fairfax Rochester’s pride; and that did not scare me, because I am used to the sight of the demon. But, sir, as it grew dark, the wind rose: it blew yesterday evening, not as it blows now—wild and high—but ‘with a sullen, moaning sound’ far more eerie. I wished you were at home. I came into this room, and the sight of the empty chair and fireless hearth chilled me. For some time after I went to bed, I could not sleep—a sense of anxious excitement distressed me. The gale still rising seemed to my ear to muffle a mournful under-sound; whether in the house or abroad I could not at first tell, but it recurred, doubtful yet doleful at every lull; at last I made out it must be some dog howling at a distance. I was glad when it ceased. On sleeping, I continued in dreams the idea of a dark and gusty night. I continued also the wish to be with you, and experienced a strange, regretful consciousness of some barrier dividing us. During all my first sleep, I was following the windings of an unknown road; total obscurity environed me; rain pelted me; I was burdened with the charge of a little child: a very small creature, too young and feeble to walk, and which shivered in my cold arms, and wailed piteously in my ear. I thought, sir, that you were on the road a long way before me; and I strained every nerve to overtake you, and made effort on effort to utter your name and entreat you to stop—but my movements were fettered, and my voice still died away inarticulate; while you, I felt, withdrew farther and farther every moment.”",

I consider the prospect of living with you wonderful because I love you. Please, sir, don't show affection now—let me speak without interruption. Yesterday I had great faith in God and believed events were unfolding for the benefit of us both. It was a beautiful day, if you recall; the still air and sky calmed any fears about your journey's safety or comfort. After tea, I walked outside for a while, thinking of you. In my imagination, you felt so close that I hardly felt your absence. I thought about the life ahead—your life, sir—an existence much grander and more exciting than my own, as much more so as the deep ocean is compared to the narrow channel of a brook. I wondered why moralists call this world a desolate wasteland; for me, it was blooming beautifully like a rose. Just as the sun set, the air grew cold and the sky became cloudy. I went inside. Sophie called me upstairs to see my wedding dress, which had just arrived. Inside the box, beneath the dress, I discovered your gift—the veil you ordered from London with your extravagant, princely taste. Since I wouldn't accept jewels, I suppose you decided to trick me into taking something equally expensive. I smiled as I unfolded it, planning how I would tease you about your upper-class preferences and your efforts to dress me, your common bride, in the style of a noblewoman. I thought about bringing down the simple, unadorned lace I had prepared myself to cover my humble head and asking if it wasn't sufficient for a woman who brings neither wealth, beauty, nor connections to her husband. I clearly saw how you would look and heard your passionate, outspoken replies, and your proud insistence that you have no need to increase your fortune or social standing by marrying money or a title.” “You read me perfectly, you enchantress!” Mr. Rochester interjected. “But what else did you find in the veil besides its intricate work? Did you find poison or a dagger, that you look so sad now?” “No, no, sir; apart from the delicate, rich quality of the material, I found nothing but Fairfax Rochester's pride. And that didn't frighten me because I'm familiar with that particular inclination. But, sir, as darkness fell, the wind picked up. It blew yesterday evening, not with the fierce intensity it has now, but with a low, mournful sound that was much more unsettling. I wished you were home. I came into this room, and the sight of the empty chair and cold fireplace made me feel cold too. For a while after I went to bed, I couldn't sleep; a feeling of nervous excitement troubled me. The wind, which continued to rise, seemed to carry a quiet, sad sound. I couldn't tell at first if it was inside or outside, but it kept returning, uncertain yet sorrowful, whenever the wind momentarily died down. Eventually, I realized it must be a dog howling in the distance. I was relieved when it stopped. When I finally fell asleep, my dreams continued the theme of a dark and stormy night. I also continued to wish I was with you and felt a strange, sorrowful awareness of some obstacle separating us. Throughout my first sleep, I was following a winding, unfamiliar road. Complete darkness surrounded me, rain beat down on me, and I was burdened with the care of a small child—a very tiny creature, too young and weak to walk, shivering in my cold arms and crying pitifully in my ear. I thought, sir, that you were far ahead on the road, and I strained every muscle to catch up to you, trying repeatedly to call your name and beg you to stop. But my movements were restricted, and my voice kept fading away, unable to form words, while I felt you were moving farther and farther away with every moment.”",

I see it as wonderful to hope for a life with you, because I love you. Please, sir, don’t embrace me just yet—let me speak. Yesterday, I placed my faith in Providence and believed that everything was unfolding for both our benefit; you may recall it was a lovely day—the peaceful weather put to rest any fears about your safety or comfort during your travels. After tea, I walked outside for a short time, thinking about you; in my mind, you felt so near, I hardly noticed your absence. I thought about your future life—so much broader and more exciting than mine, as a river is deeper and broader than the narrow brook that joins it. I wondered why philosophers call the world a sad wasteland, when for me it seemed to flourish beautifully. Just as the sun set, the air became chilly and the sky overcast, so I went inside. Sophie fetched me upstairs to see my wedding dress, which had just arrived, and under it in the box was your present—the extravagant veil you sent from London, I suppose since you couldn’t give me jewels, you wanted to give me something equally precious. I smiled as I opened it and thought of teasing you about your fancy tastes and your wish to dress your simple bride like a noblewoman. I imagined myself bringing you the plain veil I had made for myself, asking if that wasn’t good enough for someone like me, who couldn’t offer money, beauty, or family connections. I pictured your indignant response, insisting you needed nothing from me but myself, and you didn’t want to marry for wealth or status.\n\nMr. Rochester interrupted, saying I understood him perfectly and asked if I’d seen something troubling, a poison or dagger, in the veil. I replied that apart from the veil’s fine quality, I saw nothing but your pride, which doesn’t really scare me as I’m familiar with it. But as the evening darkened, the wind started to blow—not as fiercely as tonight, but with a mournful sound that was unsettling. I wished you were there. Coming into this room, I was disturbed to see your empty chair and the cold fireplace. I couldn’t sleep for some time because of an uneasy excitement. The wind, growing stronger, seemed filled with a sorrowful tone; I wasn’t sure if it was inside or outside but heard it every time the wind lulled. Eventually, I realized it was probably a dog howling in the distance, and I felt relief when it stopped. When I finally slept, my dreams were of a dark, stormy night, and I kept wishing to be near you, feeling an odd and sad sense of separation. My dreams showed me traveling on an unfamiliar, dark road, in heavy rain, carrying a tiny, helpless child who cried in my arms. I thought you were far ahead on the same road, and I tried desperately to catch up and call to you, but I was held back and couldn’t make myself heard, while you seemed to keep moving farther away from me."

I thought I had found the source of your melancholy in a dream.”\nI shook my head. “What! is there more? But I will not believe it to be anything important. I warn you of incredulity beforehand. Go on.”\nThe disquietude of his air, the somewhat apprehensive impatience of his manner, surprised me: but I proceeded.\n“I dreamt another dream, sir: that Thornfield Hall was a dreary ruin, the retreat of bats and owls. I thought that of all the stately front nothing remained but a shell-like wall, very high and very fragile-looking. I wandered, on a moonlight night, through the grass-grown enclosure within: here I stumbled over a marble hearth, and there over a fallen fragment of cornice. Wrapped up in a shawl, I still carried the unknown little child: I might not lay it down anywhere, however tired were my arms—however much its weight impeded my progress, I must retain it. I heard the gallop of a horse at a distance on the road; I was sure it was you; and you were departing for many years and for a distant country. I climbed the thin wall with frantic perilous haste, eager to catch one glimpse of you from the top: the stones rolled from under my feet, the ivy branches I grasped gave way, the child clung round my neck in terror, and almost strangled me; at last I gained the summit. I saw you like a speck on a white track, lessening every moment. The blast blew so strong I could not stand. I sat down on the narrow ledge; I hushed the scared infant in my lap: you turned an angle of the road: I bent forward to take a last look; the wall crumbled; I was shaken; the child rolled from my knee, I lost my balance, fell, and woke.”",
          "paraphrase_gemini-2.5-flash-preview-04-17": "\"So these dreams are affecting your mood even now that I am with you, Jane? My little sensitive friend! Forget these imaginary troubles and focus on true happiness! You told me you love me, Janet; yes, I won't forget that, and you can't deny it. Those words came out clearly. I heard them distinct and gentle: perhaps a bit serious, but lovely as music – 'I think it is a wonderful thing to hope to live with you, Edward, because I love you.' Do you still love me, Jane? Say it again.\" \"I do, sir – I do, with all my heart.\" \"Well,\" he said after a moment of quiet, \"it's strange, but that phrase has touched me deeply and painfully. Why? I think it's because you spoke it with such sincere, heartfelt conviction, and because the way you look up at me now embodies the highest level of faith, truth, and dedication; it's almost like a spirit is near me. Look mischievous, Jane, as you know how to do so well: show me one of your spirited, shy, teasing smiles; tell me you dislike me – bother me, irritate me; do anything but make me feel emotional. I'd rather be angered than saddened.\" \"I will tease and bother you to your heart's content once I've finished my story, but please listen to the rest.\" \"Jane, I believed you had told me everything. I thought I had found the reason for your sadness in a dream.\" I shook my head. \"What! There's more? But I refuse to believe it's anything important. I'm telling you now I'm skeptical. Go on.\" His troubled expression and somewhat anxious impatience surprised me, but I proceeded. \"Sir, I dreamt another dream: that Thornfield Hall was a desolate ruin, a home for bats and owls. I imagined that of the entire grand facade, only a thin, very tall, fragile-looking wall remained. On a moonlit night, I walked through the grass-covered area inside: I tripped over a marble fireplace here, and a fallen piece of molding there. Still wrapped in a shawl, I carried the unknown little child from before; I could not set it down anywhere, no matter how weary my arms were or how much its weight slowed my progress, I had to hold it. I heard the sound of a horse galloping in the distance on the road; I was certain it was you, leaving for many years and a distant place. I climbed the thin wall in a desperate, dangerous rush, eager to catch a final sight of you from the top. The stones tumbled from beneath my feet, the ivy branches I gripped snapped, the child clung terrified around my neck, almost strangling me; finally, I reached the peak. I saw you as a tiny dot on a white path, shrinking every moment. The wind blew so strongly I could not stand. I sat down on the narrow edge; I comforted the frightened infant in my lap. You turned a corner on the road; I leaned forward for one last look; the wall crumbled; I was shaken; the child rolled from my lap, I lost my balance, fell, and woke up.\"",

Let go of these fanciful sorrows and focus on real happiness. You say you love me, Janet—and I won't forget that; you can't take it back. Those words were spoken clearly, not left unsaid. I heard them, solemn but lovely: ‘I think it’s a wonderful thing to hope for a life with you, Edward, because I love you.’ Do you love me, Jane? Say it again.\"\n\n\"I do, sir—I do, with all my heart.\"\n\nAfter a pause, he continued, \"It’s odd, but that declaration has struck me deeply and almost caused me pain. Why?

Jane, look mischievous as you sometimes do; give me one of your sly, teasing smiles, say you hate me—anything to stir me up; I’d rather be annoyed than made sad.\"\n\n\"I’ll tease and vex you as much as you want, once I’ve finished my story—please just listen until I’m done.\"\n\n\"I thought you’d already told me everything, Jane. I thought your sadness came from a dream.\"\n\nI shook my head. \"There’s more. But don’t worry—it’s probably nothing important. I warn you, you might not believe it. Go on.\"\n\nHis slightly uneasy manner surprised me, but I continued. \"I had another dream: I saw Thornfield Hall in ruins, abandoned to bats and owls. Nearly all the grand facade was gone except a high, fragile wall. I wandered in the overgrown grounds that night, tripping over rubble here and there. I was wrapped in a shawl, still holding the same unknown child, and though my arms ached and it slowed me, I couldn’t put the child down. I heard a distant horse, certain it was you, riding away for years to some far country. In my desperation, I scaled the crumbling wall, struggling to glimpse you; stones and ivy fell away beneath me, the frightened child clung to my neck, nearly choking me. At last, I reached the top and saw you as a fading dot on the road. The wind was so strong I had to sit, cradling the frightened child. You turned a corner and vanished; as I leaned forward for a final look, the wall collapsed, I slipped, lost the child from my knee, and fell—then I woke up.\""

But I was mistaken; it was only candlelight. Sophie, I supposed, had come in. There was a light in the dressing-table, and the door of the closet, where, before going to bed, I had hung my wedding-dress and veil, stood open; I heard a rustling there. I asked, ‘Sophie, what are you doing?’ No one answered; but a form emerged from the closet; it took the light, held it aloft, and surveyed the garments pendent from the portmanteau. ‘Sophie! Sophie!’ I again cried: and still it was silent. I had risen up in bed, I bent forward: first surprise, then bewilderment, came over me; and then my blood crept cold through my veins. Mr. Rochester, this was not Sophie, it was not Leah, it was not Mrs. Fairfax: it was not—no, I was sure of it, and am still—it was not even that strange woman, Grace Poole.”\n“It must have been one of them,” interrupted my master.\n“No, sir, I solemnly assure you to the contrary. The shape standing before me had never crossed my eyes within the precincts of Thornfield Hall before; the height, the contour were new to me.”\n“Describe it, Jane.”\n“It seemed, sir, a woman, tall and large, with thick and dark hair hanging long down her back. I know not what dress she had on: it was white and straight; but whether gown, sheet, or shroud, I cannot tell.”\n“Did you see her face?”\n“Not at first. But presently she took my veil from its place; she held it up, gazed at it long, and then she threw it over her own head, and turned to the mirror. At that moment I saw the reflection of the visage and features quite distinctly in the dark oblong glass.”\n“And how were they?”\n“Fearful and ghastly to me—oh, sir, I never saw a face like it! It was a discoloured face—it was a savage face. I wish I could forget the roll of the red eyes and the fearful blackened inflation of the lineaments!”\n“Ghosts are usually pale, Jane.”\n“This, sir, was purple: the lips were swelled and dark; the brow furrowed: the black eyebrows widely raised over the bloodshot eyes. Shall I tell you of what it reminded me?”\n“You may.”\n“Of the foul German spectre—the Vampyre.”\n“Ah!—what did it do?”\n“Sir, it removed my veil from its gaunt head, rent it in two parts, and flinging both on the floor, trampled on them.”\n“Afterwards?”\n“It drew aside the window-curtain and looked out; perhaps it saw dawn approaching, for, taking the candle, it retreated to the door. Just at my bedside, the figure stopped: the fiery eyes glared upon me—she thrust up her candle close to my face, and extinguished it under my eyes. I was aware her lurid visage flamed over mine, and I lost consciousness: for the second time in my life—only the second time—I became insensible from terror.”",

When I woke up, a brightness caught my eye, and I initially thought it was sunrise. However, it turned out to be just candlelight. I assumed it was Sophie entering the room. A light was on the dressing table, and the door to the wardrobe where I’d hung my wedding dress and veil before bed was open. I heard a rustling sound from inside. I called out, ‘Sophie, what are you doing?’ There was no answer. Then a figure emerged from the wardrobe. It picked up the candle, held it high, and examined my clothing hanging on the luggage stand. ‘Sophie! Sophie!’ I called again, but it remained silent. I had sat up in bed and leaned forward. First, I felt surprise, then confusion, and finally, my blood ran cold. Mr. Rochester, it was not Sophie, nor Leah, nor Mrs. Fairfax. It was not—I am certain, and remain so—not even that peculiar woman, Grace Poole.” “It must have been one of them,” my master interrupted. “No, sir, I assure you solemnly that it was not. The figure standing there was someone I had never seen within the grounds of Thornfield Hall before; its height and build were completely unfamiliar to me.” “Describe her, Jane.” “She appeared to be a woman, sir, tall and large, with thick, dark hair that hung long down her back. I couldn’t tell what she was wearing; it was white and plain, but whether it was a gown, a sheet, or a burial shroud, I cannot say.” “Did you see her face?” “Not at first. But then she took my veil down, held it up, stared at it for a while, and then put it over her own head and turned towards the mirror. At that moment, I saw the reflection of her face and features quite clearly in the dark, oblong glass.” “And what did they look like?” “Terrifying and repulsive to me—oh, sir, I have never seen such a face! It was discolored and savage. I wish I could forget the movement of her red eyes and the horrifying, dark swelling of her features!” “Ghosts are usually pale, Jane.” “This one, sir, was purple. Her lips were swollen and dark, her brow was furrowed, and her black eyebrows were raised high over bloodshot eyes. May I tell you what she reminded me of?” “You may.” “The dreadful German spirit—the Vampyre.” “Ah! And what did she do next?” “Sir, she removed my veil from her thin head, ripped it in two, threw both pieces on the floor, and stamped on them.” “After that?” “She pulled back the window curtain and looked out, perhaps seeing the approach of dawn, because she then took the candle and went towards the door. The figure stopped right beside my bed. Her fiery eyes glared at me—she thrust her candle close to my face and put it out right before my eyes. I felt her ghastly face flaming over mine, and I lost consciousness. It was the second time in my life—only the second time—that terror made me faint.”",

When I woke up, a bright light blinded me for a moment. I assumed it was morning, but it was actually just candlelight. I thought Sophie had entered. There was light on the dressing table, and the closet door—where I had hung my wedding gown and veil before bedtime—was open. I heard something moving inside. I called out to Sophie to ask what she was doing, but got no reply. Then, someone came out of the closet, picked up the light, raised it, and examined the clothes hanging on my luggage. Again I called for Sophie, but it stayed quiet. I sat up in bed and leaned forward, feeling first startled, then confused, and then suddenly chilled with fear. Mr. Rochester, I know it was not Sophie, nor Leah, nor Mrs. Fairfax; and I am sure it was not even Grace Poole, that strange woman.\" \n\nMr. Rochester interrupted, insisting, \"It must have been one of them.\" Jane answered solemnly, \"No, sir, I assure you it was not.

Jane said, \"It seemed to be a woman, tall and big, with thick, dark hair hanging down her back.

I wish I could forget the rolling red eyes and the horribly swollen black features!\" Mr. Rochester noted that ghosts are supposed to be pale, but Jane said, \"No, sir, her face was purplish—the lips were dark and swollen; the brow was furrowed; black eyebrows raised high over bloodshot eyes. Would you like to know what she reminded me of?\" Mr. Rochester said yes. Jane said, \"Of the horrible German ghost—a Vampire.\" Mr. Rochester asked what the apparition did. Jane replied, \"She removed my veil from her head, tore it in half, threw the pieces down, and trampled on them.\" \n\nHe asked what happened next. Jane said, \"She pulled back the window curtain and looked outside; maybe she saw it was nearly dawn. Taking the candle, she started to leave the room.

Oh, to think what might have happened!”\nHe drew his breath short, and strained me so close to him, I could scarcely pant. After some minutes’ silence, he continued, cheerily—\n“Now, Janet, I’ll explain to you all about it. It was half dream, half reality. A woman did, I doubt not, enter your room: and that woman was—must have been—Grace Poole. You call her a strange being yourself: from all you know, you have reason so to call her—what did she do to me? what to Mason? In a state between sleeping and waking, you noticed her entrance and her actions; but feverish, almost delirious as you were, you ascribed to her a goblin appearance different from her own: the long dishevelled hair, the swelled black face, the exaggerated stature, were figments of imagination; results of nightmare: the spiteful tearing of the veil was real: and it is like her. I see you would ask why I keep such a woman in my house: when we have been married a year and a day, I will tell you; but not now. Are you satisfied, Jane? Do you accept my solution of the mystery?”\nI reflected, and in truth it appeared to me the only possible one: satisfied I was not, but to please him I endeavoured to appear so—relieved, I certainly did feel; so I answered him with a contented smile. And now, as it was long past one, I prepared to leave him.",

Now, sir, please tell me who that woman was and what she is.\" Rochester dismissed it, saying, \"It was definitely the product of an overactive mind. I need to take care of you, my dear; your delicate nerves aren't suited for such shock.\" Jane insisted, \"Sir, my nerves were fine; the event was real; it actually happened.\" Rochester countered, \"And were your earlier dreams real too?

Why, today is the day we are to be permanently united. Once married, these frightening mental experiences will stop, I promise.\" Jane protested, \"'Mental terrors,' sir! I wish I could believe that's all they were. I wish it even more now, since you can't explain the mystery of that terrifying visitor.\" Rochester concluded, \"And since I cannot explain it, Jane, it must not have been real.\" Jane argued, \"But, sir, when I told myself that this morning after waking, and when I looked around the room in bright daylight for reassurance from the familiar surroundings, there – on the floor – I saw something that utterly contradicted my assumption: the veil, completely ripped in two!\" Mr. Rochester flinched and shivered. He quickly wrapped his arms around her, exclaiming, \"Thank God that if something harmful came near you last night, only the veil was damaged. Oh, the thought of what could have happened!\" He gasped for breath and held her so tightly she could barely breathe.

A woman did indeed enter your room, I'm sure, and that woman was – it must have been – Grace Poole. You yourself describe her as strange; based on what you know, you have reason to think so. What did she do to me? What did she do to Mason? In a state between sleep and wakefulness, you noticed her entering and acting, but being feverish, almost delirious, you imagined her as a monstrous figure unlike herself. The messy, long hair, the swollen black face, the exaggerated height were products of your imagination, the result of a nightmare. The malicious act of tearing the veil was real, though, and it's typical of her. I know you want to ask why I keep such a woman here. After we've been married a year and a day, I will tell you, but not now. Are you satisfied, Jane? Do you accept my explanation for the mystery?\" Jane pondered, and it honestly seemed like the only plausible explanation. She wasn't truly satisfied, but she tried to appear so to please him.

If any evil did come near you last night, it was only the veil injured. Who knows what could have happened!\"\nHe breathed shakily and held me tightly. After some silence, he spoke more cheerfully—\n\"Now, Janet, let me explain. It was partly dream, partly real. Someone did come into your room: it was Grace Poole, I'm sure. She’s odd, and you know she’s capable of strange things—remember what she did to me, to Mason? In a dreamlike state, you noticed her but, being feverish and delirious, imagined her appearance as something monstrous: the wild hair, black face, exaggerated body were your imagination; the tearing of the veil, though, was real, and fits her. You’re wondering why I keep her here: after we’ve been married a year and a day, I’ll tell you—not now. Are you satisfied with this explanation, Jane?\"\nI thought about it, and it seemed like the only explanation. Though not satisfied, I pretended to be, to make him happy—I was at least relieved, so I smiled. Since it was already past one o’clock, I began to leave him."

I quickly moved away from her hands as soon as I possibly could. \"Stop!\" she exclaimed in French. \"Look at yourself in the mirror; you haven't even taken a peek.\" So I paused at the doorway and turned. I saw a figure dressed in a robe and veil, looking so unlike my usual self that it seemed almost like a reflection of a stranger. \"Jane!\" a voice called out, and I quickly hurried down. Mr. Rochester met me at the bottom of the stairs. \"You are lingering!\" he said, \"my mind is burning with impatience, and you are taking such a long time!\" He led me into the dining room, examined me intently from head to toe, pronounced me \"as fair as a lily, and not only the pride of his life but also the object of his desire,\" and then told me he would only allow me ten minutes to eat some breakfast before ringing the bell.

There were no groomsmen, no bridesmaids, no relatives to wait for or organize; only Mr. Rochester and me. Mrs. Fairfax was standing in the hall as we passed by. I wished I could have spoken to her, but my hand was held in a grip like iron; I was hurried along by a pace I could barely keep up with.

I wonder what other groom ever looked as he did—so intensely focused on a goal, so sternly determined; or who, under such steady eyebrows, ever revealed such blazing and intense eyes.

He chided me for taking so long, claiming his impatience was overwhelming, and led me into the dining room. There, he examined me carefully, complimented my appearance, and declared I had only ten minutes to eat breakfast before ringing for a servant. Upon asking about the carriage and the luggage, and ensuring everything was prepared for our departure to the church, Mr. Rochester had the servant check whether Mr. Wood and the clerk were at the church, which was close by. The servant soon returned, confirming they were present and that the horses were being readied. Mr. Rochester said we wouldn’t need the carriage to get to the church, but it should be ready for our return, with all their belongings loaded and the coachman in place. When he asked if I was ready, I got up. There were no attendants or relatives—just Mr. Rochester and myself. Mrs. Fairfax watched as we passed, but Mr. Rochester’s firm grip hurried me along so quickly that I couldn’t stop to speak to her. He looked intensely focused and determined, more so, I thought, than any other prospective bridegroom. As we walked down the drive, I paid no attention to the weather or my surroundings; my thoughts and senses were entirely fixed on Mr. Rochester.

The purpose of marriage was explained, and then the minister stepped a bit closer to Mr. Rochester, and, leaning slightly towards him, continued.\n\n“I require and charge you both (as you will answer on the final day of judgment, when all secrets will be revealed), that if you know of any reason why you may not be rightfully married, confess it now; for understand that anyone joined together against the word of God are not truly married, nor is their union lawful.”\n\nHe stopped, as is customary. How often is this pause interrupted by a response? Probably less than once in a hundred years. The minister, without looking up from his book and after only a brief pause, was about to continue; his hand was extended towards Mr. Rochester and his mouth was opening to ask, “Will you take this woman as your wife?”—when a clear, nearby voice interrupted—\n\n“This marriage cannot proceed: I announce there is an impediment.”\n\nThe minister looked up in silence at the speaker; so did the clerk. Mr. Rochester moved slightly, as if startled by an earthquake, but then braced himself, and without looking around or moving his gaze, said, “Go on.”\n\nA deep silence followed his words, spoken in a quiet but intense tone."

What a hot and strong grasp he had! and how like quarried marble was his pale, firm, massive front at this moment!

Mr. Rochester has a wife now living.”\nMy nerves vibrated to those low-spoken words as they had never vibrated to thunder—my blood felt their subtle violence as it had never felt frost or fire; but I was collected, and in no danger of swooning. I looked at Mr. Rochester: I made him look at me. His whole face was colourless rock: his eye was both spark and flint. He disavowed nothing: he seemed as if he would defy all things.

His hold was incredibly strong and hot, and at that moment, his pale, firm, and imposing face resembled roughly cut stone. His eyes, still vigilant yet with a wildness underlying them, shone intensely. Mr. Wood appeared uncertain, asking, \"What kind of obstacle is this? Can it perhaps be overcome or explained away?\" The response was, \"Highly unlikely. I called it insurmountable and I stand by that statement after careful consideration.\" The speaker moved forward and leaned on the barrier. He continued, articulating each word clearly, calmly, and steadily, though not loudly: \"It is simply that a prior marriage exists. Mr. Rochester is already married; his wife is alive.\" These quiet words affected my nerves more intensely than thunder ever had, and their subtle force impacted my blood more profoundly than extreme cold or heat; however, I remained composed and was in no danger of fainting.

His pale, broad face was stern, almost marble-like, and his eyes shone fiercely yet wildly beneath his brow. Mr. Wood appeared puzzled. He asked what the obstacle was, wondering if it could be resolved or explained away. The reply came, \"Unlikely. I've called it insurmountable and I mean it.\" The speaker stepped forward, rested on the railing, and continued clearly and steadily, though not loudly: \"The obstacle is simple: Mr. Rochester is already married; his wife is still alive.\" Hearing this, my nerves felt more shaken than by thunder; the shock ran through my blood more than fire or ice ever had. Yet I remained calm and in control. I looked at Mr. Rochester and made him look at me. His face was stone-pale, his gaze intense and unyielding. He did not deny anything; he seemed ready to defy everything. He said nothing, did not smile, nor acknowledge me as a person—he only wrapped his arm around my waist and held me tightly at his side."

His eye, as I have often said, was a black eye: it had now a tawny, nay, a bloody light in its gloom; and his face flushed—olive cheek and hueless forehead received a glow as from spreading, ascending heart-fire: and he stirred, lifted his strong arm—he could have struck Mason, dashed him on the church-floor, shocked by ruthless blow the breath from his body—but Mason shrank away, and cried faintly, “Good God!” Contempt fell cool on Mr. Rochester—his passion died as if a blight had shrivelled it up: he only asked—“What have you to say?”\nAn inaudible reply escaped Mason’s white lips.",

He took a document from his pocket and read aloud in a somewhat formal, nasal tone: \"I affirm and can prove that on October 20th in a year fifteen years ago, Edward Fairfax Rochester, of Thornfield Hall in a certain county, and of Ferndean Manor in --shire, England, was married to my sister, Bertha Antoinetta Mason, the daughter of Jonas Mason, a merchant, and his wife Antoinetta, a Creole, at a church in Spanish Town, Jamaica.

Mr. Mason, please step forward.\" Hearing the name, Mr. Rochester clenched his jaw and experienced a strong, involuntary tremor. Standing close by, I could feel the violent surge of anger or despair pass through his body. The second stranger, who had been standing back until now, approached. A pale face appeared over the solicitor's shoulder - yes, it was Mason himself. Mr. Rochester turned and glared intensely at him. As I have often noted, his eyes were dark, but now they held a fierce, even bloodshot gleam within their darkness. His face flushed; his typically olive cheek and pale forehead glowed as if heated from within. He moved, raising his strong arm - he seemed ready to strike Mason, throw him to the church floor, perhaps even fatally injure him with a brutal blow. However, Mason flinched away, crying out weakly, \"Good God!\" Contempt settled calmly upon Mr. Rochester; his intense emotion died as if suddenly withered.

Rochester glared at him, his dark eyes burning with intensity, and his face flushed with passion. He looked ready to strike Mason, but Mason recoiled, exclaiming weakly, \"Good God!\" Suddenly, Rochester’s anger subsided, overtaken by cold contempt. He asked Mason, \"Well, what do you have to say?\" Mason only managed a barely audible answer."

I am little better than a devil at this moment; and, as my pastor there would tell me, deserve no doubt the sternest judgments of God, even to the quenchless fire and deathless worm. Gentlemen, my plan is broken up:—what this lawyer and his client say is true: I have been married, and the woman to whom I was married lives! You say you never heard of a Mrs. Rochester at the house up yonder, Wood; but I daresay you have many a time inclined your ear to gossip about the mysterious lunatic kept there under watch and ward. Some have whispered to you that she is my bastard half-sister: some, my cast-off mistress. I now inform you that she is my wife, whom I married fifteen years ago,—Bertha Mason by name; sister of this resolute personage, who is now, with his quivering limbs and white cheeks, showing you what a stout heart men may bear. Cheer up, Dick!—never fear me!—I’d almost as soon strike a woman as you. Bertha Mason is mad; and she came of a mad family; idiots and maniacs through three generations! Her mother, the Creole, was both a madwoman and a drunkard!—as I found out after I had wed the daughter: for they were silent on family secrets before. Bertha, like a dutiful child, copied her parent in both points. I had a charming partner—pure, wise, modest: you can fancy I was a happy man. I went through rich scenes! Oh! my experience has been heavenly, if you only knew it! But I owe you no further explanation. Briggs, Wood, Mason, I invite you all to come up to the house and visit Mrs. Poole’s patient, and my wife! You shall see what sort of a being I was cheated into espousing, and judge whether or not I had a right to break the compact, and seek sympathy with something at least human. This girl,” he continued, looking at me, “knew no more than you, Wood, of the disgusting secret: she thought all was fair and legal; and never dreamt she was going to be entrapped into a feigned union with a defrauded wretch, already bound to a bad, mad, and embruted partner! Come all of you—follow!”",

I visited her there last April. I am her brother.\" \"At Thornfield Hall!\" the clergyman exclaimed, astonished. \"That's impossible! I've lived in this area for a long time and have never heard of a Mrs. Rochester living at Thornfield Hall.\" I observed a bitter smile twist Mr. Rochester's mouth as he muttered, \"Indeed, I made sure no one would know of it—or of her using that name.\" He fell silent for a while, contemplating. After perhaps ten minutes of internal debate, he reached a decision and declared, \"Enough! Everything will come out at once, like a shot from a gun. Wood, close your book and remove your vestments; John Green (addressing the clerk), leave the church: there will be no wedding today.\" The men complied. Mr. Rochester continued, boldly and without reserve: \"Bigamy is a terrible word! Yet, that's exactly what I intended; but fate has thwarted me, or perhaps Providence has stopped me—likely the latter. At this moment, I feel barely human; and, as my spiritual advisor here would point out, I undoubtedly deserve God's severest judgment, including eternal damnation. Gentlemen, my scheme has failed: what this lawyer and his client state is true: I am married, and my wife is alive! You claim you've never heard of a Mrs. Rochester at my house, Wood; but I'm sure you've often listened to rumors about the mysterious insane woman kept under strict supervision there. Some may have whispered she's my illegitimate half-sister; others, my discarded mistress. I now reveal that she is my wife, whom I married fifteen years ago—her name is Bertha Mason; she is the sister of this determined individual, whose trembling limbs and pale face demonstrate the inner courage men can possess. Chin up, Dick! Don't be afraid of me! I'd sooner strike a woman than you. Bertha Mason is insane; and her family was insane; generations of idiots and maniacs! Her mother, the Creole woman, was both mad and an alcoholic!—a fact I only discovered after marrying the daughter; they concealed family secrets beforehand. Bertha, like a good child, followed her mother's example in both respects. I married a wonderful partner—pure, wise, modest: you can imagine my joy. I experienced such delightful moments! Oh! my life was paradise, if only you knew it! But I owe you no further explanations. Briggs, Wood, Mason, I invite you all to come to the house and meet Mrs. Poole's patient, and my wife! You will witness the type of person I was tricked into marrying, and decide whether I was justified in breaking that bond and seeking comfort from someone at least human. This young woman,\" he added, looking at me, \"knew nothing more than you, Wood, about this horrifying secret: she believed everything was proper and legal; she never suspected she was about to be trapped in a false marriage to an unfortunate man already tied to a cruel, mad, and degraded partner! Everyone—come, follow me!\"",
          "paraphrase_gpt-4.1-2025-04-14": "\"If you can't give a clear answer, then something's truly wrong,\" said the gentleman, insisting, \"I ask again: what do you have to say?\" The clergyman interrupted, reminding, \"Sir, please remember you're in a church,\" and then gently questioned Mason, \"Do you know if this man's wife is still alive?\" The lawyer prompted him, \"Be brave and speak clearly.\" Mason, more steadily now, replied, \"She is alive at Thornfield Hall. I saw her there last April. She is my sister.\" The clergyman was shocked, exclaiming that he'd lived in the area for years and had never heard of Mrs. Rochester at Thornfield Hall. I noticed a grim smile on Mr. Rochester's face as he muttered to himself that he'd made sure no one knew about her under that name. After deliberating for about ten minutes, he made up his mind and declared, \"That's enough, everything will come out at once. Wood, close your book and take off your surplice; John Green, you can leave. There will be no wedding today.\" The directions were followed. Then, Mr. Rochester continued boldly, \"Bigamy is a dreadful accusation! I was about to commit bigamy, but destiny, or perhaps Providence, has stopped me. Right now, I feel like a devil, deserving the harshest punishment, even hell itself. Gentlemen, the claims made by the lawyer and his client are true: I am already married, and my wife still lives. Wood, you've probably heard the rumors of a mysterious madwoman kept at Thornfield Hall. Some claimed she was my illegitimate sister, others said she was a cast-off mistress. The truth is, she is my wife, Bertha Mason, sister to this man Mason. She's mad, from a family of madness across generations—her mother was insane and an alcoholic, something I learned only after the wedding because her family kept it secret. Bertha imitated her mother in both respects. I had a wife in name only, and my life with her was anything but happy—despite how it looked from the outside. But I owe you no further explanation. Briggs, Wood, Mason, I invite you all to visit Bertha, Mrs. Poole's patient—my wife! See for yourselves who I was tricked into marrying, and decide if I had any right to break the vows and look for some humanity elsewhere. As for this young woman,\" he said, indicating me, \"she didn't know about any of this—she thought everything was legitimate and had no idea she was being drawn into a false marriage with a man already tied to someone dreadful. Now, come all of you—follow me!\""

At the front door of the hall we found the carriage.\n“Take it back to the coach-house, John,” said Mr. Rochester coolly; “it will not be wanted to-day.”\nAt our entrance, Mrs. Fairfax, Adèle, Sophie, Leah, advanced to meet and greet us.\n“To the right-about—every soul!” cried the master; “away with your congratulations! Who wants them? Not I!—they are fifteen years too late!”\nHe passed on and ascended the stairs, still holding my hand, and still beckoning the gentlemen to follow him, which they did. We mounted the first staircase, passed up the gallery, proceeded to the third storey: the low, black door, opened by Mr. Rochester’s master-key, admitted us to the tapestried room, with its great bed and its pictorial cabinet.\n“You know this place, Mason,” said our guide; “she bit and stabbed you here.”\nHe lifted the hangings from the wall, uncovering the second door: this, too, he opened. In a room without a window, there burnt a fire guarded by a high and strong fender, and a lamp suspended from the ceiling by a chain. Grace Poole bent over the fire, apparently cooking something in a saucepan. In the deep shade, at the farther end of the room, a figure ran backwards and forwards. What it was, whether beast or human being, one could not, at first sight, tell: it grovelled, seemingly, on all fours; it snatched and growled like some strange wild animal: but it was covered with clothing, and a quantity of dark, grizzled hair, wild as a mane, hid its head and face.\n“Good-morrow, Mrs. Poole!” said Mr. Rochester. “How are you? and how is your charge to-day?”\n“We’re tolerable, sir, I thank you,” replied Grace, lifting the boiling mess carefully on to the hob: “rather snappish, but not ’rageous.”\nA fierce cry seemed to give the lie to her favourable report: the clothed hyena rose up, and stood tall on its hind-feet.\n“Ah! sir, she sees you!” exclaimed Grace: “you’d better not stay.”\n“Only a few moments, Grace: you must allow me a few moments.”\n“Take care then, sir!—for God’s sake, take care!”\nThe maniac bellowed: she parted her shaggy locks from her visage, and gazed wildly at her visitors. I recognised well that purple face,—those bloated features. Mrs. Poole advanced.\n“Keep out of the way,” said Mr. Rochester, thrusting her aside: “she has no knife now, I suppose, and I’m on my guard.”\n“One never knows what she has, sir: she is so cunning: it is not in mortal discretion to fathom her craft.”\n“We had better leave her,” whispered Mason.\n“Go to the devil!” was his brother-in-law’s recommendation.\n“’Ware!” cried Grace. The three gentlemen retreated simultaneously. Mr. Rochester flung me behind him: the lunatic sprang and grappled his throat viciously, and laid her teeth to his cheek: they struggled. She was a big woman, in stature almost equalling her husband, and corpulent besides: she showed virile force in the contest—more than once she almost throttled him, athletic as he was. He could have settled her with a well-planted blow; but he would not strike: he would only wrestle. At last he mastered her arms; Grace Poole gave him a cord, and he pinioned them behind her: with more rope, which was at hand, he bound her to a chair. The operation was performed amidst the fiercest yells and the most convulsive plunges. Mr. Rochester then turned to the spectators: he looked at them with a smile both acrid and desolate.",
          "paraphrase_gemini-2.5-flash-preview-04-17": "Keeping a firm hold on me, Mr. Rochester exited the church, followed by the three gentlemen. At the main entrance of the hall, we encountered the carriage. “Return it to the coach-house, John,” Mr. Rochester instructed calmly. “It won’t be needed today.” As we entered, Mrs. Fairfax, Adèle, Sophie, and Leah came forward to greet and welcome us. “About-face, everyone!” the master shouted. “Away with your congratulations! Who wants them? Not me! They are fifteen years too late!” He moved past them and went up the stairs, still clutching my hand and gesturing for the gentlemen to follow, which they did. We ascended the first flight of stairs, walked through the gallery, and continued up to the third floor. The low, dark door, unlocked by Mr. Rochester’s master-key, granted us entry to the tapestried room containing a large bed and a painted cabinet. “You are familiar with this location, Mason,” our guide stated. “She attacked you here, biting and stabbing.” He lifted the hangings from the wall, uncovering a second door, which he also opened. Inside a windowless room, a fire burned, protected by a tall, sturdy fender, and a lamp hung from the ceiling by a chain. Grace Poole was bent over the fire, seemingly preparing food in a pot. In the deep shadows at the room’s far end, a figure paced back and forth. At first glance, it was difficult to determine if it was a beast or a human being; it seemed to crawl on all fours, snatching and growling like a strange wild animal. However, it was clothed, and a mass of dark, greyish, untamed hair, like a mane, obscured its head and face. “Good morning, Mrs. Poole!” Mr. Rochester greeted. “How are you, and how is your charge today?” “We are reasonably well, sir, I thank you,” Grace replied, carefully moving the boiling mixture onto the hob. “She’s rather irritable, but not violent.” A fierce scream appeared to contradict her positive assessment. The clothed individual, described like a hyena, rose and stood upright on its legs. “Ah, sir, she sees you!” Grace exclaimed. “You should probably leave.” “Just a few moments, Grace; you must allow me a short time.” “Then be cautious, sir! For heaven’s sake, be careful!” The insane person roared; she pushed aside her shaggy hair from her face and stared wildly at her visitors. I clearly recognised that purplish face and those swollen features. Mrs. Poole stepped forward. “Stay out of the way,” Mr. Rochester commanded, pushing her aside. “She doesn’t have a knife now, I presume, and I am ready.” “You can never be certain what she possesses, sir; she is so sly. It is impossible for ordinary human judgment to understand her cunning.” “We should leave her,” Mason whispered. “Go to the devil!” was his brother-in-law’s reply. “Look out!” Grace cried. The three gentlemen instantly moved back. Mr. Rochester pushed me behind him. The madwoman leaped and viciously grabbed his throat, sinking her teeth into his cheek. They wrestled. She was a large woman, nearly his height and also stout; she displayed masculine strength during the struggle, almost choking him more than once, despite his athleticism. He could have subdued her with a single strong blow, but he chose not to hit her, only to grapple. Eventually, he gained control of her arms. Grace Poole handed him a rope, and he tied them behind her back. Using more rope that was accessible, he bound her to a chair. The entire procedure was carried out amidst intense shrieks and violent thrashing. Mr. Rochester then turned to the observers, looking at them with a smile that was both bitter and sorrowful.",
          "paraphrase_gpt-4.1-2025-04-14": "Still holding firmly onto me, Mr. Rochester led me out of the church, with the three gentlemen following behind. When we reached the main entrance of the hall, the carriage was waiting for us. Mr. Rochester, in a calm manner, told John to return the carriage to the coach house, saying it wouldn’t be needed that day. As we came inside, Mrs. Fairfax, Adèle, Sophie, and Leah stepped forward to welcome us, but Mr. Rochester quickly dismissed their greetings, declaring that any congratulations were not only unwanted but also too late by fifteen years. Continuing on, he led me upstairs, keeping my hand in his and signaling for the gentlemen to come along. We went up the first staircase, through the gallery, and up to the third floor. There, Mr. Rochester used a master key to unlock a low, black door, and we entered a room decorated with tapestries, containing a large bed and an ornate cabinet. Mr. Rochester addressed Mason, pointing out that this was the place where he had been bitten and stabbed before. He then pulled back some hangings to reveal another door, which he also opened. Inside a windowless room, a fire burned, protected by a high guard, and a hanging lamp provided light. Grace Poole was by the fire, apparently making something in a saucepan. At the far end in the shadows, there was a figure moving erratically, at first impossible to distinguish as human or animal due to its wild behavior and appearance resembling a beast, with disheveled clothes and a thick mane of hair obscuring the face. Mr. Rochester greeted Grace and asked how she and her charge were doing. Grace responded they were tolerable, though her charge was a bit irritable but not furious. Suddenly, a violent scream contradicted Grace’s reassuring words, and the wild figure rose to stand on two feet. Grace warned Mr. Rochester that the woman had seen him and advised him not to stay long. He insisted on staying for a brief time, and she cautioned him to be careful. The madwoman bellowed, pushed her hair aside to reveal a swollen, purple face that I recognized, and glared wildly at us. When Mrs. Poole moved closer, Mr. Rochester warned her to keep back, making sure the woman had no weapon and prepared to defend himself. Grace warned that the madwoman was so cunning, it was impossible to anticipate what she might do. Mason suggested they should leave, but Mr. Rochester refused angrily. Suddenly, Grace shouted a warning, and the three gentlemen retreated at once. Mr. Rochester pushed me behind him as the frenzied woman lunged at him, grabbed his throat, and bit at his cheek. They struggled fiercely; although Mr. Rochester was strong, the woman was nearly as tall and stout and fought with surprising strength. Despite the struggle, he refused to strike her, choosing only to restrain her. Eventually, he managed to pin her arms, and Grace handed him a cord so he could tie her hands behind her back, then use more rope to secure her to a chair. All this was done amid violent shrieks and wild thrashing. When it was over, Mr. Rochester looked at the onlookers with a bitter, sorrowful smile."

Mr. Eyre mentioned the intelligence; for he knew that my client here was acquainted with a gentleman of the name of Rochester. Mr. Mason, astonished and distressed as you may suppose, revealed the real state of matters. Your uncle, I am sorry to say, is now on a sick bed; from which, considering the nature of his disease—decline—and the stage it has reached, it is unlikely he will ever rise. He could not then hasten to England himself, to extricate you from the snare into which you had fallen, but he implored Mr. Mason to lose no time in taking steps to prevent the false marriage. He referred him to me for assistance. I used all despatch, and am thankful I was not too late: as you, doubtless, must be also. Were I not morally certain that your uncle will be dead ere you reach Madeira, I would advise you to accompany Mr. Mason back; but as it is, I think you had better remain in England till you can hear further, either from or of Mr. Eyre. Have we anything else to stay for?” he inquired of Mr. Mason.\n“No, no—let us be gone,” was the anxious reply; and without waiting to take leave of Mr. Rochester, they made their exit at the hall door.

When your uncle received your letter announcing your planned marriage to Mr. Rochester, Mr. Mason happened to be with him. Mr. Mason was recuperating in Madeira on his way back to Jamaica. Mr. Eyre mentioned the news because he was aware that my client knew a gentleman named Rochester. As you can imagine, Mr. Mason was shocked and distressed and disclosed the true situation. I regret to inform you that your uncle is currently very ill; given the nature and advanced stage of his disease, consumption, it is improbable he will recover.

And yet where was the Jane Eyre of yesterday?—where was her life?—where were her prospects?\nJane Eyre, who had been an ardent, expectant woman—almost a bride, was a cold, solitary girl again: her life was pale; her prospects were desolate. A Christmas frost had come at midsummer; a white December storm had whirled over June; ice glazed the ripe apples, drifts crushed the blowing roses; on hayfield and cornfield lay a frozen shroud: lanes which last night blushed full of flowers, to-day were pathless with untrodden snow; and the woods, which twelve hours since waved leafy and fragrant as groves between the tropics, now spread, waste, wild, and white as pine-forests in wintry Norway. My hopes were all dead—struck with a subtle doom, such as, in one night, fell on all the first-born in the land of Egypt. I looked on my cherished wishes, yesterday so blooming and glowing; they lay stark, chill, livid corpses that could never revive. I looked at my love: that feeling which was my master’s—which he had created; it shivered in my heart, like a suffering child in a cold cradle; sickness and anguish had seized it; it could not seek Mr. Rochester’s arms—it could not derive warmth from his breast. Oh, never more could it turn to him; for faith was blighted—confidence destroyed! Mr. Rochester was not to me what he had been; for he was not what I had thought him. I would not ascribe vice to him; I would not say he had betrayed me; but the attribute of stainless truth was gone from his idea, and from his presence I must go: that I perceived well. When—how—whither, I could not yet discern; but he himself, I doubted not, would hurry me from Thornfield. Real affection, it seemed, he could not have for me; it had been only fitful passion: that was balked; he would want me no more. I should fear even to cross his path now: my view must be hateful to him. Oh, how blind had been my eyes! How weak my conduct!\nMy eyes were covered and closed: eddying darkness seemed to swim round me, and reflection came in as black and confused a flow. Self-abandoned, relaxed, and effortless, I seemed to have laid me down in the dried-up bed of a great river; I heard a flood loosened in remote mountains, and felt the torrent come: to rise I had no will, to flee I had no strength. I lay faint, longing to be dead. One idea only still throbbed life-like within me—a remembrance of God: it begot an unuttered prayer: these words went wandering up and down in my rayless mind, as something that should be whispered, but no energy was found to express them—\n“Be not far from me, for trouble is near: there is none to help.”\nIt was near: and as I had lifted no petition to Heaven to avert it—as I had neither joined my hands, nor bent my knees, nor moved my lips—it came: in full heavy swing the torrent poured over me. The whole consciousness of my life lorn, my love lost, my hope quenched, my faith death-struck, swayed full and mighty above me in one sullen mass. That bitter hour cannot be described: in truth, “the waters came into my soul; I sank in deep mire: I felt no standing; I came into deep waters; the floods overflowed me.”",
          "paraphrase_gemini-2.5-flash-preview-04-17": "I heard him leave as I stood by the partially open door of my room, where I had retreated. With the house now empty, I went inside, bolted the door to keep anyone out, and began – not to cry or mourn, as I was still too composed for that – but automatically to remove the wedding dress and put back on the plain fabric dress I had worn yesterday, believing it was for the last time. I then sat down, feeling weak and worn out. I rested my arms on a table and let my head fall onto them. And now I started thinking; until this point, I had merely reacted, observed, moved – simply following where I was directed or pulled – watching events unfold one after another, secrets being revealed progressively: but now, I was processing. The morning had been quite calm overall – apart from the brief incident with the madwoman. The events in the church hadn't been chaotic; there was no emotional outburst, no loud argument, no dispute, no challenge or defiance, no tears, no crying. Just a few words spoken, a calmly stated objection to the marriage was made, followed by some sharp, short questions from Mr. Rochester, answers, explanations given, proof presented, my master openly admitting the truth, and then the sight of the living evidence. The people who intervened were gone, and it was finished. I was in my room just as usual – physically, I seemed unchanged; nothing had struck me, scorched me, or injured me. Yet, where was the Jane Eyre from yesterday? Where was her life? Where were her prospects for the future? Jane Eyre, who had been a passionate, hopeful woman, almost a wife, was now just a cold, lonely girl again. Her life felt bleak, her future prospects desolate. It was like a harsh winter frost had arrived in midsummer; a snowstorm in December had swept through June. Ice covered the ripe apples, snowdrifts crushed the blooming roses. A frozen sheet lay over the hayfields and cornfields. The paths that were full of colourful flowers last night were today impassable with fresh snow, and the woods that twelve hours ago were lush and fragrant like tropical forests now stretched out, empty, desolate, and white like pine forests in a Norwegian winter. My hopes were all dead, struck down by a swift and final blow, similar to the doom that fell on all the first-born in Egypt in a single night. I looked at my cherished desires, so vibrant and bright yesterday; they lay lifeless, cold, pale bodies that could never be revived. I looked at my love, the feeling that belonged to my master, which he had created. It shivered in my heart like a suffering child in a cold crib; illness and pain had gripped it. It couldn't seek comfort in Mr. Rochester's arms – it couldn't get warmth from his chest. Oh, it could never turn to him again, because my trust was ruined – my confidence destroyed! Mr. Rochester was not the person he had been to me, because he was not the person I had believed him to be. I wouldn't accuse him of wickedness; I wouldn't say he deliberately deceived me, but the quality of absolute honesty was gone from how I saw him, and I understood clearly that I must leave his presence. I couldn't yet figure out when, how, or where, but I had no doubt that he himself would quickly remove me from Thornfield. It seemed he couldn't have had true affection for me; it must have only been fleeting passion, which was now stopped. He wouldn't want me anymore. I would even be scared to cross his path now; the sight of me must be hateful to him. Oh, how blind I had been! How foolish my actions had seemed! My eyes were covered and closed; a swirling darkness seemed to surround me, and my thoughts came in a similarly dark and jumbled rush. Feeling completely resigned, weak, and incapable, I felt as though I had collapsed into the dry riverbed of a great river. I heard a flood unleashed in distant mountains and felt the rush of the current coming. I had no will to get up, no strength to run. I lay there, faint and longing to die. Only one thought still felt alive within me – a memory of God. This prompted a silent prayer. These words wandered in my dark mind, like something that should be whispered, but I lacked the energy to express them aloud: \"Do not be far from me, for trouble is near; there is no one to help.\" It was indeed near. And since I had not lifted any prayer to Heaven to prevent it – as I had neither clasped my hands, nor knelt down, nor moved my lips – it came. The torrent poured over me in a full, heavy surge. The entire weight of my ruined life, my lost love, my extinguished hope, my faith struck dead, hung powerfully and completely over me in one dark mass. That painful hour cannot be put into words. Truly, as the saying goes, \"the waters came into my soul; I sank in deep mire: I felt no standing; I came into deep waters; the floods overflowed me.\"",
          "paraphrase_gpt-4.1-2025-04-14": "I stood by the half-open door of my own room, listening to his departure before withdrawing inside. Once the house was empty, I locked myself in to ensure I wouldn’t be disturbed. I didn’t cry or grieve—I was still too composed for that. Instead, almost automatically, I removed the wedding dress and changed back into the plain gown I thought I’d worn for the last time the day before. Feeling drained, I sat down, rested my arms on the table, and lowered my head. Up to now, I'd only processed events as they happened, acted as I was directed, witnessing one shocking revelation after another. But now, I had the space to think. \n\nThat morning had been calm overall, apart from the brief outburst with the madwoman. The scene at the church had been quiet—there were no tempers flaring, no loud arguments, no tears. Just a few words exchanged: an objection to the marriage stated, some short, stern questions, explanations, proof provided, and finally, Mr. Rochester himself admitted the truth. The evidence had been shown, the strangers had left, and it was over. \n\nBack in my room, everything seemed unchanged on the surface. I wasn’t physically hurt or changed. Yet, I questioned the fate of the Jane Eyre from the day before—her life and her hopes for the future. The woman who had been full of anticipation and on the verge of marriage was now alone and desolate again. All the promise and excitement had vanished; it was as if a harsh winter had descended in the middle of summer, destroying everything in its path. My hopes and dreams, vibrant and alive only yesterday, now seemed irreversibly dead. The love I felt, which Mr. Rochester had inspired in me, now felt cold and miserable—as if it were sick and suffering and could no longer be comforted by him. I could no longer trust him, because he was not the man I believed him to be. He hadn’t betrayed me maliciously, but he had lost the perfect honesty I saw in him, and I knew I had to leave. I didn’t know when or how, but I immediately sensed that he would want me gone from Thornfield now that his secret was out. Maybe his feelings for me had never been genuine love, just a fleeting passion that was now over. I even felt that he’d want to avoid seeing me, and I was ashamed at my own naiveté.\n\nMy eyes closed as confusion and dark thoughts overwhelmed me. I felt powerless, as if I were lying at the bottom of a dry riverbed, awaiting a torrent released from far away that I couldn’t escape or resist. I longed for oblivion. Only one thought remained: a sense of God, which stirred a silent prayer inside me—the words repeating silently: “Be not far from me, for trouble is near: there is none to help.” Trouble truly was close. Since I hadn’t prayed for its prevention, it came roaring over me, and the full painful realization of my situation crashed down. The despair of lost love, hope, and faith overcame me completely. The agony of that moment was beyond description; I felt emotionally submerged, trapped, and overwhelmed."

I said I could not bear such words now. “That I am not Edward Rochester’s bride is the least part of my woe,” I alleged: “that I have wakened out of most glorious dreams, and found them all void and vain, is a horror I could bear and master; but that I must leave him decidedly, instantly, entirely, is intolerable. I cannot do it.”\nBut, then, a voice within me averred that I could do it and foretold that I should do it. I wrestled with my own resolution: I wanted to be weak that I might avoid the awful passage of further suffering I saw laid out for me; and Conscience, turned tyrant, held Passion by the throat, told her tauntingly, she had yet but dipped her dainty foot in the slough, and swore that with that arm of iron he would thrust her down to unsounded depths of agony.\n“Let me be torn away, then” I cried. “Let another help me!”\n“No; you shall tear yourself away, none shall help you: you shall yourself pluck out your right eye; yourself cut off your right hand: your heart shall be the victim, and you the priest to transfix it.”\nI rose up suddenly, terror-struck at the solitude which so ruthless a judge haunted,—at the silence which so awful a voice filled. My head swam as I stood erect. I perceived that I was sickening from excitement and inanition; neither meat nor drink had passed my lips that day, for I had taken no breakfast. And, with a strange pang, I now reflected that, long as I had been shut up here, no message had been sent to ask how I was, or to invite me to come down: not even little Adèle had tapped at the door; not even Mrs. Fairfax had sought me. “Friends always forget those whom fortune forsakes,” I murmured, as I undrew the bolt and passed out. I stumbled over an obstacle: my head was still dizzy, my sight was dim, and my limbs were feeble. I could not soon recover myself. I fell, but not on to the ground: an outstretched arm caught me. I looked up—I was supported by Mr. Rochester, who sat in a chair across my chamber threshold.",
          "paraphrase_gemini-2.5-flash-preview-04-17": "Late in the afternoon, I lifted my head. Seeing the sun's light painting the western wall, marking the day's end, I questioned, \"What should I do?\" However, the immediate and terrifying response from my mind, \"Leave Thornfield immediately,\" was so overwhelming that I covered my ears. I declared I couldn't bear to hear those words then. I asserted that the least of my suffering was not being Edward Rochester's bride; I could endure the pain of waking from wonderful dreams to find them empty and meaningless. But, having to leave him permanently, instantly, and completely was unbearable. I insisted I couldn't do it. Yet, an inner voice asserted that I could and would do it. I fought against my own resolve. I wished to be weak to avoid the terrible future suffering I saw ahead. My conscience, acting like a tyrant, held Passion captive, sarcastically saying she had only just begun to experience the difficulty, and swore that with an unyielding grip, he would force her into unimaginable depths of pain. \"Then let me be torn away!\" I cried. \"Let someone else help me!\" The inner voice replied, \"No, you will tear yourself away; no one will help you. You will sacrifice your own dearest part; you will sever your own strength. Your heart will be the victim, and you will be the one to pierce it.\" I suddenly stood up, frightened by the loneliness where such a harsh judge resided, and by the silence filled by such a terrifying voice. My head swam as I stood. I realised I was becoming ill from stress and lack of food, as I hadn't eaten or drunk anything all day. With a sharp ache, I thought how long I had been alone in my room without anyone sending a message to check on me or invite me downstairs. Not even little Adèle had knocked, nor had Mrs. Fairfax sought me out. \"Friends always forget those whom fate abandons,\" I whispered as I unbolted the door and stepped out. I stumbled over something. My head was still spinning, my vision blurry, and my legs weak. I couldn't regain my balance quickly. I fell, but I didn't hit the floor. An outstretched arm caught me. I looked up and saw I was being supported by Mr. Rochester, who was seated in a chair just outside my room's doorway.",
          "paraphrase_gpt-4.1-2025-04-14": "Later that afternoon, I lifted my head and, noticing how the sun in the west cast fading light across the wall, I wondered aloud what I should do. My mind immediately replied, urging me to leave Thornfield without delay—a response so frightening that I tried to block it out, insisting I couldn’t handle such an idea right then. I told myself that not being Mr. Rochester’s bride was only a small part of my pain. The true anguish was in waking from beautiful dreams and finding them empty, but what I truly couldn’t bear was the thought of leaving him completely and at once. Still, something inside me insisted that I not only could, but must, do it. I struggled with my determination, wishing I could be weak and avoid the pain I knew was ahead. But my conscience—the tyrant—overpowered my feelings, declaring that my suffering had only just begun and threatening to drag me through deeper agony. In desperation, I wished for someone to make the separation for me, but the inner voice insisted that I must do it myself, comparing it to tearing out my own eye or hand and being both the priest and the sacrifice. Suddenly, filled with fear at being alone with such pitiless self-judgment, I stood up, feeling dizzy and weak from lack of food, since I hadn’t eaten all day. I realized that no one had sent word to ask after me or invited me downstairs—not even little Adèle or Mrs. Fairfax had come. I reflected bitterly that people always abandon those whom misfortune strikes. Unlocking my door, I left my room, but stumbled from weakness; however, before I hit the ground, someone caught me. Looking up, I saw it was Mr. Rochester, seated in a chair at my doorway, supporting me."

So you shun me?—you shut yourself up and grieve alone! I would rather you had come and upbraided me with vehemence. You are passionate: I expected a scene of some kind. I was prepared for the hot rain of tears; only I wanted them to be shed on my breast: now a senseless floor has received them, or your drenched handkerchief. But I err: you have not wept at all! I see a white cheek and a faded eye, but no trace of tears. I suppose, then, your heart has been weeping blood?\n“Well, Jane! not a word of reproach? Nothing bitter—nothing poignant? Nothing to cut a feeling or sting a passion? You sit quietly where I have placed you, and regard me with a weary, passive look.\n“Jane, I never meant to wound you thus. If the man who had but one little ewe lamb that was dear to him as a daughter, that ate of his bread and drank of his cup, and lay in his bosom, had by some mistake slaughtered it at the shambles, he would not have rued his bloody blunder more than I now rue mine. Will you ever forgive me?”\nReader, I forgave him at the moment and on the spot. There was such deep remorse in his eye, such true pity in his tone, such manly energy in his manner; and besides, there was such unchanged love in his whole look and mien—I forgave him all: yet not in words, not outwardly; only at my heart’s core.\n“You know I am a scoundrel, Jane?” ere long he inquired wistfully—wondering, I suppose, at my continued silence and tameness, the result rather of weakness than of will.\n“Yes, sir.”\n“Then tell me so roundly and sharply—don’t spare me.”\n“I cannot: I am tired and sick. I want some water.” He heaved a sort of shuddering sigh, and taking me in his arms, carried me downstairs. At first I did not know to what room he had borne me; all was cloudy to my glazed sight: presently I felt the reviving warmth of a fire; for, summer as it was, I had become icy cold in my chamber. He put wine to my lips; I tasted it and revived; then I ate something he offered me, and was soon myself. I was in the library—sitting in his chair—he was quite near. “If I could go out of life now, without too sharp a pang, it would be well for me,” I thought; “then I should not have to make the effort of cracking my heart-strings in rending them from among Mr. Rochester’s. I must leave him, it appears. I do not want to leave him—I cannot leave him.”",

He preferred she had confronted him angrily, expecting an emotional outburst given her passionate nature. He was ready for a torrent of tears, only wishing they had been shed on his chest instead of the floor or a soaked handkerchief. However, correcting himself, he noted she hadn't cried at all, seeing only pallor and tired eyes, no sign of tears. He then speculated her heart must have been weeping blood.\n\nHe continued, \"Well, Jane, no accusations? Nothing harsh or painful? Nothing to wound a feeling or provoke a strong reaction? You just sit calmly where I placed you, looking at me with a weary, resigned expression.\"\n\n\"Jane,\" he stated, \"I never intended to hurt you like this. If a man who cherished his single little ewe lamb like a daughter, one that shared his food, drink, and slept in his arms, accidentally slaughtered it, he would regret his mistake no more than I regret mine now. Can you ever forgive me?\"\n\nReader, I forgave him instantly. His eyes showed such profound remorse, his voice held such true pity, his manner such strong resolution; and beyond that, his entire appearance and demeanor revealed unchanged love—I forgave everything. Not with words, not externally, but deep within my heart.\n\nAfter a moment, he asked wistfully, perhaps surprised by my continued silence and subdued state, which stemmed more from weakness than unwillingness, \"You know I'm a scoundrel, Jane?\"\n\n\"Yes, sir,\" I replied.\n\n\"Then tell me so plainly and sharply—don't hold back,\" he urged.\n\n\"I cannot,\" I said. \"I am exhausted and unwell. I need some water.\" He let out a shaky sigh and, picking me up, carried me downstairs. At first, my vision was clouded, and I didn't know where he had taken me. Soon, I felt the restoring warmth of a fire; despite being summer, I had become icy cold in my room. He offered me wine, which I sipped and felt revived. Then I ate something he gave me and quickly felt like myself again. I was in the library, sitting in his chair, with him very close by. \"If I could die now without too much pain, it would be best,\" I thought, \"then I wouldn't have to make the effort of tearing my heart-strings away from Mr. Rochester.

He expected tears and a dramatic scene, hoping I would weep on his chest rather than the floor or into my handkerchief. But he saw no evidence that I had cried, just a pale face and tired eyes, so he guessed that my heart must be silently breaking. He observed that I made no complaints or accusations, but just sat passively and looked at him with exhaustion. He insisted he never wanted to hurt me, and compared himself to a man who had accidentally killed his beloved pet, saying his regret was just as great and he wondered if I could forgive him. I did forgive him instantly, moved by the genuine remorse and affection in his voice and manner, though I did not say so aloud—my forgiveness was silent and inward. He asked me if I believed he was a scoundrel, and I agreed, but could not muster the energy to reproach him, only saying I was tired and unwell. He sighed, carried me downstairs, and tried to revive me with wine and food until I recovered.

I know you—I am on my guard.”\n“Sir, I do not wish to act against you,” I said; and my unsteady voice warned me to curtail my sentence.\n“Not in your sense of the word, but in mine you are scheming to destroy me. You have as good as said that I am a married man—as a married man you will shun me, keep out of my way: just now you have refused to kiss me. You intend to make yourself a complete stranger to me: to live under this roof only as Adèle’s governess; if ever I say a friendly word to you, if ever a friendly feeling inclines you again to me, you will say,—‘That man had nearly made me his mistress: I must be ice and rock to him;’ and ice and rock you will accordingly become.”\nI cleared and steadied my voice to reply: “All is changed about me, sir; I must change too—there is no doubt of that; and to avoid fluctuations of feeling, and continual combats with recollections and associations, there is only one way—Adèle must have a new governess, sir.”\n“Oh, Adèle will go to school—I have settled that already; nor do I mean to torment you with the hideous associations and recollections of Thornfield Hall—this accursed place—this tent of Achan—this insolent vault, offering the ghastliness of living death to the light of the open sky—this narrow stone hell, with its one real fiend, worse than a legion of such as we imagine. Jane, you shall not stay here, nor will I. I was wrong ever to bring you to Thornfield Hall, knowing as I did how it was haunted. I charged them to conceal from you, before I ever saw you, all knowledge of the curse of the place; merely because I feared Adèle never would have a governess to stay if she knew with what inmate she was housed, and my plans would not permit me to remove the maniac elsewhere—though I possess an old house, Ferndean Manor, even more retired and hidden than this, where I could have lodged her safely enough, had not a scruple about the unhealthiness of the situation, in the heart of a wood, made my conscience recoil from the arrangement. Probably those damp walls would soon have eased me of her charge: but to each villain his own vice; and mine is not a tendency to indirect assassination, even of what I most hate.\n“Concealing the mad-woman’s neighbourhood from you, however, was something like covering a child with a cloak and laying it down near a upas-tree: that demon’s vicinage is poisoned, and always was. But I’ll shut up Thornfield Hall: I’ll nail up the front door and board the lower windows: I’ll give Mrs. Poole two hundred a year to live here with my wife, as you term that fearful hag: Grace will do much for money, and she shall have her son, the keeper at Grimsby Retreat, to bear her company and be at hand to give her aid in the paroxysms, when my wife is prompted by her familiar to burn people in their beds at night, to stab them, to bite their flesh from their bones, and so on—”\n“Sir,” I interrupted him, “you are inexorable for that unfortunate lady: you speak of her with hate—with vindictive antipathy. It is cruel—she cannot help being mad.”\n“Jane, my little darling (so I will call you, for so you are), you don’t know what you are talking about; you misjudge me again: it is not because she is mad I hate her. If you were mad, do you think I should hate you?”\n“I do indeed, sir.”\n“Then you are mistaken, and you know nothing about me, and nothing about the sort of love of which I am capable. Every atom of your flesh is as dear to me as my own: in pain and sickness it would still be dear. Your mind is my treasure, and if it were broken, it would be my treasure still: if you raved, my arms should confine you, and not a strait waistcoat—your grasp, even in fury, would have a charm for me: if you flew at me as wildly as that woman did this morning, I should receive you in an embrace, at least as fond as it would be restrictive. I should not shrink from you with disgust as I did from her: in your quiet moments you should have no watcher and no nurse but me; and I could hang over you with untiring tenderness, though you gave me no smile in return; and never weary of gazing into your eyes, though they had no longer a ray of recognition for me.—But why do I follow that train of ideas? I was talking of removing you from Thornfield. All, you know, is prepared for prompt departure: to-morrow you shall go. I only ask you to endure one more night under this roof, Jane; and then, farewell to its miseries and terrors for ever! I have a place to repair to, which will be a secure sanctuary from hateful reminiscences, from unwelcome intrusion—even from falsehood and slander.”\n“And take Adèle with you, sir,” I interrupted; “she will be a companion for you.”\n“What do you mean, Jane? I told you I would send Adèle to school; and what do I want with a child for a companion, and not my own child,—a French dancer’s bastard? Why do you importune me about her! I say, why do you assign Adèle to me for a companion?”\n“You spoke of a retirement, sir; and retirement and solitude are dull: too dull for you.”\n“Solitude! solitude!” he reiterated with irritation. “I see I must come to an explanation. I don’t know what sphynx-like expression is forming in your countenance. You are to share my solitude. Do you understand?”\nI shook my head: it required a degree of courage, excited as he was becoming, even to risk that mute sign of dissent. He had been walking fast about the room, and he stopped, as if suddenly rooted to one spot. He looked at me long and hard: I turned my eyes from him, fixed them on the fire, and tried to assume and maintain a quiet, collected aspect.\n“Now for the hitch in Jane’s character,” he said at last, speaking more calmly than from his look I had expected him to speak. “The reel of silk has run smoothly enough so far; but I always knew there would come a knot and a puzzle: here it is. Now for vexation, and exasperation, and endless trouble! By God! I long to exert a fraction of Samson’s strength, and break the entanglement like tow!”\nHe recommenced his walk, but soon again stopped, and this time just before me.\n“Jane! will you hear reason?” (he stooped and approached his lips to my ear); “because, if you won’t, I’ll try violence.” His voice was hoarse; his look that of a man who is just about to burst an insufferable bond and plunge headlong into wild license. I saw that in another moment, and with one impetus of frenzy more, I should be able to do nothing with him. The present—the passing second of time—was all I had in which to control and restrain him: a movement of repulsion, flight, fear would have sealed my doom,—and his. But I was not afraid: not in the least. I felt an inward power; a sense of influence, which supported me. The crisis was perilous; but not without its charm: such as the Indian, perhaps, feels when he slips over the rapid in his canoe. I took hold of his clenched hand, loosened the contorted fingers, and said to him, soothingly—\n“Sit down; I’ll talk to you as long as you like, and hear all you have to say, whether reasonable or unreasonable.”\nHe sat down: but he did not get leave to speak directly. I had been struggling with tears for some time: I had taken great pains to repress them, because I knew he would not like to see me weep. Now, however, I considered it well to let them flow as freely and as long as they liked. If the flood annoyed him, so much the better. So I gave way and cried heartily.\nSoon I heard him earnestly entreating me to be composed. I said I could not while he was in such a passion.\n“But I am not angry, Jane: I only love you too well; and you had steeled your little pale face with such a resolute, frozen look, I could not endure it. Hush, now, and wipe your eyes.”\nHis softened voice announced that he was subdued; so I, in my turn, became calm. Now he made an effort to rest his head on my shoulder, but I would not permit it. Then he would draw me to him: no.\n“Jane! Jane!” he said, in such an accent of bitter sadness it thrilled along every nerve I had; “you don’t love me, then? It was only my station, and the rank of my wife, that you valued? Now that you think me disqualified to become your husband, you recoil from my touch as if I were some toad or ape.”\nThese words cut me: yet what could I do or I say? I ought probably to have done or said nothing; but I was so tortured by a sense of remorse at thus hurting his feelings, I could not control the wish to drop balm where I had wounded.\n“I do love you,” I said, “more than ever: but I must not show or indulge the feeling: and this is the last time I must express it.”\n“The last time, Jane! What! do you think you can live with me, and see me daily, and yet, if you still love me, be always cold and distant?”\n“No, sir; that I am certain I could not; and therefore I see there is but one way: but you will be furious if I mention it.”\n“Oh, mention it! If I storm, you have the art of weeping.”\n“Mr. Rochester, I must leave you.”\n“For how long, Jane? For a few minutes, while you smooth your hair—which is somewhat dishevelled; and bathe your face—which looks feverish?”\n“I must leave Adèle and Thornfield. I must part with you for my whole life: I must begin a new existence among strange faces and strange scenes.”\n“Of course: I told you you should. I pass over the madness about parting from me. You mean you must become a part of me. As to the new existence, it is all right: you shall yet be my wife: I am not married. You shall be Mrs. Rochester—both virtually and nominally. I shall keep only to you so long as you and I live. You shall go to a place I have in the south of France: a whitewashed villa on the shores of the Mediterranean. There you shall live a happy, and guarded, and most innocent life. Never fear that I wish to lure you into error—to make you my mistress. Why did you shake your head? Jane, you must be reasonable, or in truth I shall again become frantic.”\nHis voice and hand quivered: his large nostrils dilated; his eye blazed: still I dared to speak.\n“Sir, your wife is living: that is a fact acknowledged this morning by yourself. If I lived with you as you desire, I should then be your mistress: to say otherwise is sophistical—is false.”\n“Jane, I am not a gentle-tempered man—you forget that: I am not long-enduring; I am not cool and dispassionate. Out of pity to me and yourself, put your finger on my pulse, feel how it throbs, and—beware!”\nHe bared his wrist, and offered it to me: the blood was forsaking his cheek and lips, they were growing livid; I was distressed on all hands. To agitate him thus deeply, by a resistance he so abhorred, was cruel: to yield was out of the question. I did what human beings do instinctively when they are driven to utter extremity—looked for aid to one higher than man: the words “God help me!” burst involuntarily from my lips.\n",
          "paraphrase_gemini-2.5-flash-preview-04-17": "“How are you feeling now, Jane?”\n“Much better, sir; I expect to be fully recovered soon.”\n“Drink some more wine, Jane.”\nI did as he asked. He then placed the glass on the table, stood in front of me, and observed me closely. Suddenly, he turned away with an intense, emotional cry I couldn't quite make out. He paced quickly around the room before returning. He leaned towards me as if to kiss me, but I remembered that such expressions of affection were now forbidden. I turned my face away and gently pushed his head aside.\n“What!—What’s the meaning of this?” he demanded quickly. “Ah, I understand! You won’t kiss the husband of Bertha Mason? You believe my embraces are already claimed and my arms occupied?”\n“In any case, there is neither space nor justification for me, sir.”\n“Tell me why, Jane? I’ll save you the effort of explaining; I’ll answer for you—Because I already have a wife, you would say. Am I right?”\n“Yes.”\n“If you believe that, you must have a bizarre impression of me; you must see me as a deceitful libertine—a base and vulgar rake who pretended genuine affection only to deliberately ensnare you and strip you of your reputation and self-respect. What do you think of that? I see you are unable to reply: firstly, you are still weak, barely able to breathe; secondly, you cannot yet bring yourself to condemn and insult me, and furthermore, your tears are ready to flow and would spill out if you spoke much; and you have no wish to argue, to scold, to cause a scene: you are considering how to act—talking, you believe, is pointless. I know you—I am prepared.”\n“Sir, I have no desire to act against you,” I stated; the shakiness in my voice made me cut my sentence short.\n“Not in your interpretation of the word, but in mine, you are planning my ruin. You have effectively stated that I am a married man—as a married man, you will avoid me, keep your distance: you just refused to kiss me. You intend to treat me like a complete stranger: to live under this roof only as Adèle’s governess; if I ever say something kind to you, if any warm feeling ever draws you to me again, you will tell yourself,—‘That man nearly made me his mistress: I must be utterly cold and unyielding to him;’ and you will indeed become cold and unyielding.”\nI cleared and steadied my voice before answering: “My circumstances are entirely changed, sir; I must change as well—there is no doubt of it; and to prevent emotional instability, and constant battles with memories and associations, there is only one possible course—Adèle must have a new governess, sir.”\n“Oh, Adèle will be sent to school—I’ve already arranged that; nor do I intend to torment you with the dreadful memories and associations of Thornfield Hall—this damned place—this cursed spot like Achan’s tent—this arrogant tomb, displaying the horror of living death to the open sky—this confined stone hell, with its single true demon, worse than a multitude of those we can imagine. Jane, you will not remain here, nor will I. It was a mistake to ever bring you to Thornfield Hall, knowing as I did its affliction. I instructed them to hide from you, before I even met you, any knowledge of the place’s curse; simply because I feared Adèle would never keep a governess if she knew the nature of the inmate she was housed with, and my plans did not allow me to move the madwoman elsewhere—though I own an old property, Ferndean Manor, even more isolated and hidden than this, where I could have lodged her securely enough, had not my conscience hesitated at the arrangement due to the unhealthiness of the location, deep within a wood. Those damp walls would probably have soon relieved me of her care: but every villain has his own vice; and mine is not a tendency towards indirect murder, even of what I detest most.\n“Concealing the lunatic’s proximity from you, however, was akin to covering a child with a cloak and laying it near a poisonous tree: that demon’s presence is toxic, and always has been. But I will close up Thornfield Hall: I will board up the front door and cover the lower windows: I will pay Mrs. Poole two hundred pounds a year to reside here with my wife, as you call that terrifying woman: Grace is motivated by money, and she shall have her son, the attendant at Grimsby Retreat, to keep her company and be available to assist during the fits, when my wife is driven by her impulse to set people’s beds on fire at night, to stab them, to tear flesh from their bones, and so forth—”\n“Sir,” I interrupted him, “you are merciless towards that unfortunate lady: you speak of her with hatred—with vengeful dislike. It is cruel—she cannot control her madness.”\n“Jane, my dear little one (for that is what you are, and so I shall call you), you do not grasp the situation; you are mistaken about me again: I do not hate her because she is mad. If you were mad, do you believe I would hate you?”\n“Yes, I truly do, sir.”\n“Then you are wrong, and you understand nothing about me, and nothing about the depth of love I am capable of. Every part of your body is as precious to me as my own: in pain and illness, it would still be precious. Your mind is my treasure, and if it were broken, it would remain my treasure: if you raved, my arms would restrain you, not a straitjacket—your grip, even in anger, would hold a fascination for me: if you attacked me as wildly as that woman did this morning, I would hold you in an embrace, which would be both affectionate and restraining. I would not recoil from you with revulsion as I did from her: in your calm moments, you would have no one watching or nursing you but me; and I could lean over you with boundless tenderness, even if you offered no smile in return; and never tire of gazing into your eyes, even if they no longer held any recognition for me.—But why am I following that train of thought? I was discussing removing you from Thornfield. As you know, everything is prepared for immediate departure: you will leave tomorrow. I only ask you to endure one more night under this roof, Jane; and then, we say goodbye to its miseries and terrors forever! I have a destination to go to, which will be a safe refuge from hateful memories, from unwelcome intrusion—even from lies and slander.”\n“And take Adèle with you, sir,” I interjected; “she would be company for you.”\n“What do you mean, Jane? I told you I would send Adèle to school; and why would I want a child for a companion, and not even my own child,—a French dancer’s illegitimate daughter? Why do you pester me about her! Tell me, why do you propose Adèle as my companion?”\n“You mentioned going into retirement, sir; and retirement and solitude are tedious: too tedious for you.”\n“Solitude! solitude!” he repeated impatiently. “It is clear I must explain. I don’t know what enigmatic look is forming on your face. You are to share my solitude. Do you comprehend?”\nI shook my head: it took considerable courage, given his increasing agitation, even to risk that silent gesture of disagreement. He had been pacing rapidly about the room, and he stopped, as if abruptly fixed to the spot. He looked at me for a long time with intensity: I averted my eyes from his, fixed them on the fire, and attempted to appear and remain calm and composed.\n“Now for the flaw in Jane’s character,” he stated finally, speaking more calmly than his expression had led me to expect. “The spool of silk has unwound smoothly enough until now; but I always knew there would be a snag and a complication: here it is. Now comes annoyance, and irritation, and endless difficulty! By God! I yearn to use a fraction of Samson’s strength and break this entanglement like flimsy tow!”\nHe resumed pacing, but soon stopped again, this time directly in front of me.\n“Jane! Will you listen to reason?” (he bent and brought his lips close to my ear); “because, if you refuse, I will resort to force.” His voice was rough; his expression was like that of a man on the verge of shattering an intolerable constraint and plunging recklessly into wild abandon. I saw that in another moment, and with one more surge of frenzy, I would have no power to control him. The present—the fleeting second—was all the time I had to control and restrain him: a movement of rejection, flight, or fear would have sealed my fate,—and his. But I was not afraid: not at all. I felt an inner strength; a sense of influence that supported me. The crisis was dangerous; but not without its appeal: perhaps like what the Indian feels when he navigates a rapid in his canoe. I took hold of his tightly clenched hand, gently uncurled his twisted fingers, and said to him, in a calming tone—\n“Please sit down; I will speak with you for as long as you wish, and hear everything you have to say, whether it is sensible or not.”\nHe sat down: but he was not immediately permitted to speak. I had been struggling with tears for some time: I had made great efforts to suppress them, knowing he disliked seeing me cry. Now, however, I decided it was best to let them flow as freely and for as long as they needed. If the flood of tears bothered him, so much the better. So I gave way and cried heartily.\nSoon I heard him earnestly pleading with me to compose myself. I said I could not while he was so agitated.\n“But I am not angry, Jane: I simply love you too intensely; and you had hardened your little pale face with such a determined, icy look, I could not bear it. Quiet now, and wipe your eyes.”\nHis softened voice indicated that he was calmer; so I, in turn, became composed. He then attempted to rest his head on my shoulder, but I did not allow it. Next, he tried to pull me towards him: again, I resisted.\n“Jane! Jane!” he said, with an accent of such bitter sorrow it sent shivers through every nerve; “So you do not love me, then? Was it only my social standing, and the status of my wife, that you valued? Now that you believe me unqualified to be your husband, you shrink from my touch as if I were some foul toad or ape.”\nThese words wounded me deeply: yet what could I do or say? I probably should have done or said nothing; but I was so tormented by a sense of guilt at hurting his feelings this way, I could not suppress the urge to soothe where I had hurt.\n“I do love you,” I said, “more than ever: but I must not display or indulge that feeling: and this is the final time I must express it.”\n“The final time, Jane! What! Do you think you can live with me, and see me every day, and yet, if you still love me, always remain cold and distant?”\n“No, sir; I am certain I could not do that; and therefore, I see there is only one course of action: but you will be furious if I mention it.”\n“Oh, speak it! If I get angry, you are skilled at weeping.”\n“Mr. Rochester, I must leave you.”\n“For how long, Jane? For a few minutes, while you smooth your hair—which is a little messy; and wash your face—which looks flushed with fever?”\n“I must leave Adèle and Thornfield. I must separate from you for the rest of my life: I must start a new existence among unfamiliar people and places.”\n“Of course: I told you that you should. I will disregard the irrational talk about parting from me. You mean you must become a part of me. As for the new existence, that is fine: you shall still be my wife: I am not married. You shall be Mrs. Rochester—both in reality and in name. I will be faithful only to you for as long as we both live. You shall go to a place I own in the south of France: a white-washed villa on the Mediterranean coast. There you shall live a happy, protected, and completely innocent life. Never fear that I intend to lead you astray—to make you my mistress. Why did you shake your head? Jane, you must be reasonable, or truly I shall become frantic again.”\nHis voice and hand trembled: his large nostrils flared; his eyes blazed: yet I dared to speak.\n“Sir, your wife is alive: that is a fact you yourself admitted this morning. If I lived with you as you wish, I would then be your mistress: to claim otherwise is misleading—it is false.”\n“Jane, I am not a mild-tempered man—you forget that: I am not patient; I am not calm and objective. Out of compassion for us both, feel my pulse, sense how it races, and—be careful!”\nHe exposed his wrist and offered it to me: the blood was draining from his cheeks and lips, they were becoming pale; I was distressed from all sides. To upset him so profoundly with a resistance he detested was cruel: to give in was impossible. I did what people instinctively do when pushed to their absolute limit—I sought help from a power greater than man: the words “God help me!” escaped my lips without conscious thought.",
          "paraphrase_gpt-4.1-2025-04-14": "Rochester asked how I was feeling, and I assured him I was much improved and expected to recover soon. He urged me to drink some more wine, which I did. He observed me closely, then suddenly turned away, expressing a surge of strong emotion. He paced the room, returned, and bent as if to kiss me, but I reminded myself not to accept such gestures and turned away. He reacted with surprise, deducing that I could not bring myself to show affection to the husband of Bertha Mason — that I believed all his affection was already spoken for. I affirmed that there was no place for me any longer.\n\nHe concluded aloud that I rejected him because he already had a wife, and surmised that I must see him as a villain who deceitfully wooed me. He anticipated that I would not respond, as I was both weak and reluctant to accuse him. Tears welled up in me, preventing speech, and he perceived that my thoughts were on how to act, not what to say. When I finally spoke, I insisted I did not wish to harm him. He countered that my intention was nonetheless to avoid him as a married man. He lamented that I intended to remain at Thornfield in a strictly professional capacity, becoming distant and cold toward him. I agreed that everything around me had changed and I would have to leave as the only way forward.\n\nHe explained that Adèle would be sent away and that he meant to close Thornfield Hall, describing it with loathing as an unwholesome, haunted place. He admitted he had concealed the secret of his wife's presence out of self-interest and struggled with the idea of moving her elsewhere due to concerns about another estate's healthiness. He confessed that, though he hated his wife, he was not capable of indirect harm. He compared hiding her to putting a child near a poisonous tree, deciding instead to shut up the hall and pay Grace Poole well to care for his wife, even with the help of Grace's son.\n\nI protested that he spoke unkindly about his afflicted wife, reminding him of her insanity. He insisted that it was not her madness that made him hate her and claimed he would still love me, even if I were in the same state. He described intensely how, even under the worst circumstances, his devotion to me would not waver.\n\nReturning to the practical matter, he said that everything was in place for my swift departure, asking me to endure just one more night at Thornfield before leaving for good. He mentioned finding a new sanctuary for both of us. I suggested he bring Adèle for companionship, but he rejected the idea and clarified that he wished for me to share his future solitude. I shook my head, and he grew agitated as the underlying rift between us became apparent. He threatened that if reasoning failed, he would resort to force, but I managed to soothe him by asking him to sit so we could talk things through. Finally able to release my pent-up tears, I wept openly, which seemed to calm him.\n\nEven so, he tried to embrace me but I refused. He expressed deep sadness, suspecting I no longer loved him and that my affections were only for his status. I confessed my enduring love but insisted it was no longer right to give it expression and that this must be the last time I admitted it. He wondered if I could continue living near him while hiding my feeling, but I said that was impossible and insisted I must leave altogether, starting a new life away from Thornfield and from him.\n\nRochester tried to reason with me, promising that I would be his only partner, that we could leave England and live blamelessly, but I refused, reminding him that his wife was still alive. To be with him on his terms would make me his mistress, a deception I could not accept. Rochester, his agitation apparent, pleaded for me to consider his feelings but I could not be swayed. Distressed by the pain I was causing him, I instinctively turned to God for strength."

I forget she knows nothing of the character of that woman, or of the circumstances attending my infernal union with her. Oh, I am certain Jane will agree with me in opinion, when she knows all that I know! Just put your hand in mine, Janet—that I may have the evidence of touch as well as sight, to prove you are near me—and I will in a few words show you the real state of the case. Can you listen to me?”\n“Yes, sir; for hours if you will.”\n“I ask only minutes. Jane, did you ever hear or know that I was not the eldest son of my house: that I had once a brother older than I?”\n“I remember Mrs. Fairfax told me so once.”\n“And did you ever hear that my father was an avaricious, grasping man?”\n“I have understood something to that effect.”\n“Well, Jane, being so, it was his resolution to keep the property together; he could not bear the idea of dividing his estate and leaving me a fair portion: all, he resolved, should go to my brother, Rowland. Yet as little could he endure that a son of his should be a poor man. I must be provided for by a wealthy marriage. He sought me a partner betimes. Mr. Mason, a West India planter and merchant, was his old acquaintance. He was certain his possessions were real and vast: he made inquiries. Mr. Mason, he found, had a son and daughter; and he learned from him that he could and would give the latter a fortune of thirty thousand pounds: that sufficed. When I left college, I was sent out to Jamaica, to espouse a bride already courted for me. My father said nothing about her money; but he told me Miss Mason was the boast of Spanish Town for her beauty: and this was no lie. I found her a fine woman, in the style of Blanche Ingram: tall, dark, and majestic. Her family wished to secure me because I was of a good race; and so did she. They showed her to me in parties, splendidly dressed. I seldom saw her alone, and had very little private conversation with her. She flattered me, and lavishly displayed for my pleasure her charms and accomplishments. All the men in her circle seemed to admire her and envy me. I was dazzled, stimulated: my senses were excited; and being ignorant, raw, and inexperienced, I thought I loved her. There is no folly so besotted that the idiotic rivalries of society, the prurience, the rashness, the blindness of youth, will not hurry a man to its commission. Her relatives encouraged me; competitors piqued me; she allured me: a marriage was achieved almost before I knew where I was. Oh, I have no respect for myself when I think of that act!—an agony of inward contempt masters me. I never loved, I never esteemed, I did not even know her. I was not sure of the existence of one virtue in her nature: I had marked neither modesty, nor benevolence, nor candour, nor refinement in her mind or manners—and, I married her:—gross, grovelling, mole-eyed blockhead that I was! With less sin I might have—But let me remember to whom I am speaking.\n“My bride’s mother I had never seen: I understood she was dead. The honeymoon over, I learned my mistake; she was only mad, and shut up in a lunatic asylum. There was a younger brother, too—a complete dumb idiot. The elder one, whom you have seen (and whom I cannot hate, whilst I abhor all his kindred, because he has some grains of affection in his feeble mind, shown in the continued interest he takes in his wretched sister, and also in a dog-like attachment he once bore me), will probably be in the same state one day. My father and my brother Rowland knew all this; but they thought only of the thirty thousand pounds, and joined in the plot against me.\n“These were vile discoveries; but except for the treachery of concealment, I should have made them no subject of reproach to my wife, even when I found her nature wholly alien to mine, her tastes obnoxious to me, her cast of mind common, low, narrow, and singularly incapable of being led to anything higher, expanded to anything larger—when I found that I could not pass a single evening, nor even a single hour of the day with her in comfort; that kindly conversation could not be sustained between us, because whatever topic I started, immediately received from her a turn at once coarse and trite, perverse and imbecile—when I perceived that I should never have a quiet or settled household, because no servant would bear the continued outbreaks of her violent and unreasonable temper, or the vexations of her absurd, contradictory, exacting orders—even then I restrained myself: I eschewed upbraiding, I curtailed remonstrance; I tried to devour my repentance and disgust in secret; I repressed the deep antipathy I felt.\n“Jane, I will not trouble you with abominable details: some strong words shall express what I have to say. I lived with that woman upstairs four years, and before that time she had tried me indeed: her character ripened and developed with frightful rapidity; her vices sprang up fast and rank: they were so strong, only cruelty could check them, and I would not use cruelty. What a pigmy intellect she had, and what giant propensities! How fearful were the curses those propensities entailed on me! Bertha Mason, the true daughter of an infamous mother, dragged me through all the hideous and degrading agonies which must attend a man bound to a wife at once intemperate and unchaste.",
          "paraphrase_gemini-2.5-flash-preview-04-17": "Mr. Rochester abruptly exclaimed, \"What an idiot I am! I keep telling her I'm not married but fail to explain why. I forget she doesn't know anything about that woman's character or the circumstances surrounding my miserable marriage to her. Oh, I am certain Jane will share my view once she knows everything I do! Just take my hand, Janet—so I have the physical confirmation as well as the visual proof that you are near me—and I will quickly explain the actual situation. Can you listen to me?\" Jane replied, \"Yes, sir; I can listen for hours if necessary.\" \"I only need a few minutes,\" he said. \"Jane, did you ever hear or know that I wasn't the oldest son in my family and that I had an older brother?\" \"I recall Mrs. Fairfax mentioning that once,\" she answered. \"And did you ever hear that my father was a greedy, grasping man?\" \"I've gathered something to that effect,\" she said. \"Well, Jane, because he was like that, he was determined to keep the property undivided; he couldn't stand the idea of splitting his estate and leaving me a substantial portion: he decided it should all go to my brother, Rowland. Yet, he also couldn't tolerate one of his sons being poor. I had to be provided for through a rich marriage. He started looking for a partner for me early on. Mr. Mason, a West India planter and merchant, was an old acquaintance. He was sure Mason's assets were real and extensive; he investigated. He found Mr. Mason had a son and daughter and learned he could and would provide the daughter with a fortune of thirty thousand pounds: that was enough. When I finished college, I was sent to Jamaica to marry a bride who had already been chosen for me. My father didn't mention her money, but he told me Miss Mason was celebrated in Spanish Town for her beauty: and that part was true. I found her to be a handsome woman, similar in style to Blanche Ingram: tall, dark, and imposing. Her family wanted to secure me because I came from a good lineage; she did too. They presented her to me at parties, dressed magnificently. I rarely saw her alone and had very little private conversation with her. She flattered me and openly displayed her charms and skills to please me. All the men around her seemed to admire her and envy me. I was captivated, stimulated; my senses were aroused; and being naive, raw, and inexperienced, I believed I loved her. There is no folly so utter that the senseless rivalries of society, the lust, the impulsiveness, the blindness of youth, won't drive a man to commit it. Her relatives encouraged me; competitors provoked me; she lured me: a marriage happened almost before I realized what was happening. Oh, I have no self-respect when I think about that act!—an intense feeling of self-contempt overcomes me. I never loved her, I never respected her, I didn't even know her. I wasn't certain of the existence of a single virtue in her character: I had observed neither modesty, nor kindness, nor honesty, nor refinement in her thoughts or actions—and yet, I married her:—what a crude, base, dim-witted fool I was! With less sin I might have—But let me remember who I am speaking to. I had never met my bride's mother: I understood she was dead. After the honeymoon, I discovered my mistake; she was merely insane and confined to an asylum. There was a younger brother, too—completely mentally deficient. The older one, whom you have seen (and whom I cannot hate, though I detest all his relatives, because he possesses some small capacity for affection in his weak mind, shown in his continued concern for his unhappy sister and also in a dog-like devotion he once showed me), will likely end up in the same condition eventually. My father and my brother Rowland knew all this; but they cared only for the thirty thousand pounds and participated in the scheme against me. These were terrible revelations; but except for the deceitful concealment, I would not have blamed my wife for them, even when I found her nature entirely different from mine, her tastes repulsive to me, her mindset common, vulgar, narrow, and remarkably incapable of being led to anything higher, expanded to anything broader—when I found that I could not spend a single evening, or even a single hour of the day with her comfortably; that pleasant conversation could not be maintained between us, because whatever topic I introduced, she immediately turned it into something simultaneously coarse and unoriginal, difficult and senseless—when I realized I would never have a peaceful or stable household, because no servant would tolerate the constant outbursts of her violent and irrational temper, or the annoyances of her absurd, contradictory, demanding orders—even then I controlled myself: I avoided reproaches, I limited protests; I tried to hide my regret and revulsion in secret; I suppressed the profound dislike I felt. Jane, I won't burden you with awful specifics: a few strong words will convey what I need to say. I lived with that woman upstairs for four years, and before that time she had truly tested me: her character matured and intensified with terrifying speed; her vices sprouted quickly and fiercely: they were so strong, only cruelty could restrain them, and I refused to use cruelty. What a tiny intellect she possessed, and what enormous urges! How dreadful were the curses those urges brought upon me! Bertha Mason, the true daughter of an infamous mother, dragged me through all the horrific and humiliating torments that must be endured by a man tied to a wife who is simultaneously intemperate and unfaithful.",

He realized Jane didn’t know anything about his wife’s true nature or the circumstances surrounding their marriage. Confident that Jane would share his perspective once she learned the facts, he asked her to take his hand to confirm her presence and promised to explain everything briefly. Jane agreed to listen for as long as he needed, but he assured her it would only take a few minutes. Rochester began by asking if Jane knew he wasn’t the eldest son in his family, and she recalled Mrs. Fairfax mentioning it. He confirmed this, adding that his father was greedy and determined both to keep his estate intact for his elder son, Rowland, and to ensure Rochester married for wealth. His father arranged a marriage between Rochester and the daughter of Mr. Mason, a wealthy planter. Rochester was sent to Jamaica to marry Miss Mason, who was widely celebrated for her beauty. Her family was eager for the match due to Rochester’s good lineage, and he was impressed by her appearance and popularity. Rochester admitted to being inexperienced and easily dazzled, coming to believe he loved her, encouraged by her family and by other suitors’ envy. The marriage happened quickly, and he now despises his own foolishness, realizing he never loved or truly knew her. He observed no virtues in her but still married her, blaming his naïveté. Rochester revealed he had never met his bride’s mother, believing she was dead, only to discover after the honeymoon that she was alive but insane in an asylum, and that Bertha also had a brother who was mentally disabled. Rochester learned that his father and brother had hidden the Mason family’s history of mental illness simply to secure the money. He felt betrayed but tried not to blame his wife for it. However, he found Bertha’s character and behavior completely incompatible and repellent. Their household became unbearable due to her temper and unreasonable demands, but he refrained from reproach and tried to contain his misery privately. Rochester summarized that he lived with Bertha for four years while her worst traits quickly grew worse; she became unmanageable, and he refused to be cruel. He described her as lacking intellect but having dangerous impulses, leading to his own suffering as her husband. Bertha Mason, like her mother, condemned him to a life of anguish due to her intemperate and unfaithful behavior."

I was rich enough now—yet poor to hideous indigence: a nature the most gross, impure, depraved I ever saw, was associated with mine, and called by the law and by society a part of me. And I could not rid myself of it by any legal proceedings: for the doctors now discovered that my wife was mad—her excesses had prematurely developed the germs of insanity. Jane, you don’t like my narrative; you look almost sick—shall I defer the rest to another day?”\n“No, sir, finish it now; I pity you—I do earnestly pity you.”\n“Pity, Jane, from some people is a noxious and insulting sort of tribute, which one is justified in hurling back in the teeth of those who offer it; but that is the sort of pity native to callous, selfish hearts; it is a hybrid, egotistical pain at hearing of woes, crossed with ignorant contempt for those who have endured them. But that is not your pity, Jane; it is not the feeling of which your whole face is full at this moment—with which your eyes are now almost overflowing—with which your heart is heaving—with which your hand is trembling in mine. Your pity, my darling, is the suffering mother of love: its anguish is the very natal pang of the divine passion. I accept it, Jane; let the daughter have free advent—my arms wait to receive her.”\n“Now, sir, proceed; what did you do when you found she was mad?”\n“Jane, I approached the verge of despair; a remnant of self-respect was all that intervened between me and the gulf. In the eyes of the world, I was doubtless covered with grimy dishonour; but I resolved to be clean in my own sight—and to the last I repudiated the contamination of her crimes, and wrenched myself from connection with her mental defects. Still, society associated my name and person with hers; I yet saw her and heard her daily: something of her breath (faugh!) mixed with the air I breathed; and besides, I remembered I had once been her husband—that recollection was then, and is now, inexpressibly odious to me; moreover, I knew that while she lived I could never be the husband of another and better wife; and, though five years my senior (her family and her father had lied to me even in the particular of her age), she was likely to live as long as I, being as robust in frame as she was infirm in mind. Thus, at the age of twenty-six, I was hopeless.\n“One night I had been awakened by her yells—(since the medical men had pronounced her mad, she had, of course, been shut up)—it was a fiery West Indian night; one of the description that frequently precede the hurricanes of those climates. Being unable to sleep in bed, I got up and opened the window. The air was like sulphur-steams—I could find no refreshment anywhere. Mosquitoes came buzzing in and hummed sullenly round the room; the sea, which I could hear from thence, rumbled dull like an earthquake—black clouds were casting up over it; the moon was setting in the waves, broad and red, like a hot cannon-ball—she threw her last bloody glance over a world quivering with the ferment of tempest. I was physically influenced by the atmosphere and scene, and my ears were filled with the curses the maniac still shrieked out; wherein she momentarily mingled my name with such a tone of demon-hate, with such language!—no professed harlot ever had a fouler vocabulary than she: though two rooms off, I heard every word—the thin partitions of the West India house opposing but slight obstruction to her wolfish cries.\n“‘This life,’ said I at last, ‘is hell: this is the air—those are the sounds of the bottomless pit! I have a right to deliver myself from it if I can. The sufferings of this mortal state will leave me with the heavy flesh that now cumbers my soul. Of the fanatic’s burning eternity I have no fear: there is not a future state worse than this present one—let me break away, and go home to God!’\n“I said this whilst I knelt down at and unlocked a trunk which contained a brace of loaded pistols: I meant to shoot myself. I only entertained the intention for a moment; for, not being insane, the crisis of exquisite and unalloyed despair, which had originated the wish and design of self-destruction, was past in a second.\n“A wind fresh from Europe blew over the ocean and rushed through the open casement: the storm broke, streamed, thundered, blazed, and the air grew pure. I then framed and fixed a resolution. While I walked under the dripping orange-trees of my wet garden, and amongst its drenched pomegranates and pine-apples, and while the refulgent dawn of the tropics kindled round me—I reasoned thus, Jane—and now listen; for it was true Wisdom that consoled me in that hour, and showed me the right path to follow.\n“The sweet wind from Europe was still whispering in the refreshed leaves, and the Atlantic was thundering in glorious liberty; my heart, dried up and scorched for a long time, swelled to the tone, and filled with living blood—my being longed for renewal—my soul thirsted for a pure draught. I saw hope revive—and felt regeneration possible. From a flowery arch at the bottom of my garden I gazed over the sea—bluer than the sky: the old world was beyond; clear prospects opened thus:—\n“‘Go,’ said Hope, ‘and live again in Europe: there it is not known what a sullied name you bear, nor what a filthy burden is bound to you. You may take the maniac with you to England; confine her with due attendance and precautions at Thornfield: then travel yourself to what clime you will, and form what new tie you like. That woman, who has so abused your long-suffering, so sullied your name, so outraged your honour, so blighted your youth, is not your wife, nor are you her husband. See that she is cared for as her condition demands, and you have done all that God and humanity require of you. Let her identity, her connection with yourself, be buried in oblivion: you are bound to impart them to no living being.

I inherited wealth, but I felt desperately impoverished inwardly because I was legally tied to a person whose nature was the most crude, corrupt, and degraded I had ever encountered. Society and the law deemed her a part of me, and I couldn't escape this bond legally because doctors had by then diagnosed her as insane—her excessive behavior had accelerated the onset of madness. Jane, my story seems to upset you; you look unwell. Should I pause the rest for another day?”\n\n“No, sir, please finish now. I genuinely feel for you; I truly pity you.”\n\n“Jane, pity from certain individuals is a poisonous and offensive offering that one is justified in rejecting forcefully. However, that kind of pity comes from unfeeling, selfish hearts; it’s a self-centered discomfort at hearing of suffering, mixed with disdain for those who have endured it. But your pity, Jane, is different. It’s not that; it’s the sentiment that fills your entire face at this moment, that makes your eyes nearly overflow, that causes your heart to ache, and your hand to tremble in mine. Your pity, my dear, is the suffering mother of love; its pain is the very birth pang of that divine emotion. I accept it, Jane. Let this offspring of pity emerge freely; my embrace is ready for it.”\n\n“Please continue, sir. What did you do after learning she was insane?”\n\n“Jane, I was on the brink of despair; only a fragment of self-respect prevented me from falling into the abyss. In the world’s eyes, I was undoubtedly stained with deep disgrace, but I decided to remain pure in my own perception. To the very end, I rejected the taint of her misdeeds and distanced myself from her mental illness. Nevertheless, society continued to link my name and identity with hers. I still saw and heard her daily; her very breath seemed to pollute the air I breathed (it was repulsive!). Furthermore, I remembered that I had once been her husband—that memory was, and still is, utterly repulsive to me. Additionally, I knew that as long as she lived, I could never marry another, better wife. And despite being five years older than me (her family and father had even lied about her age), she was likely to live as long as I would, possessing a body as strong as her mind was fragile. Thus, at twenty-six, I felt utterly without hope.\n\n“One night, her screams had woken me—(she had been confined since her diagnosis)—it was a scorching West Indian night, the kind that often precedes hurricanes in those regions. Unable to sleep, I got up and opened the window. The air was heavy and foul, like sulfur fumes—I found no relief anywhere. Mosquitoes buzzed in and droned gloomily around the room. The sea, audible from there, rumbled dully like an earthquake. Black clouds gathered above it. The moon was setting into the waves, large and red, like a hot cannonball, casting its final bloody light over a world trembling with the brewing storm. I was physically affected by the atmosphere and the scene, and my ears were filled with the curses the madwoman continued to shriek. In her cries, she repeatedly included my name with such demonic hatred and language! No professional prostitute had a fouler vocabulary than she did. Even though she was in a room two doors away, I heard every word; the thin walls of the West Indian house offered little barrier to her savage cries.\n\n“‘This existence,’ I finally told myself, ‘is hell. This air, these sounds are from the bottomless pit! I have the right to free myself from it if I can. The suffering of this earthly life will be left behind with the heavy body that burdens my soul now. I don’t fear the fanatical idea of eternal burning. There is no future state worse than this present one. Let me break free and return to God!’\n\n“I said this as I knelt down and unlocked a trunk containing a pair of loaded pistols. I intended to kill myself. The intention lasted only a moment, for being of sound mind, the peak of intense, pure despair that had prompted the wish and plan for self-destruction passed in an instant.\n\n“A fresh wind from Europe swept over the ocean and rushed through the open window. The storm erupted, pouring rain, thundering, flashing, and the air became clean. It was then I formed and solidified a resolution. As I walked beneath the dripping orange trees in my wet garden, among its soaked pomegranates and pineapples, and as the brilliant tropical dawn illuminated my surroundings, I reasoned this way, Jane—and listen now, for it was true Wisdom that comforted me in that hour and showed me the correct path to take.\n\n“The sweet wind from Europe still whispered through the refreshed leaves, and the Atlantic roared with glorious freedom. My heart, which had been dry and parched for so long, swelled in response to the sound and filled with fresh blood. My whole being yearned for renewal; my soul longed for a pure drink. I saw hope rekindle and felt regeneration was possible. From a flowery arch at the bottom of my garden, I gazed over the sea, bluer than the sky. The old world lay beyond, and clear prospects opened up like this:\n\n“‘Go,’ said Hope, ‘and live again in Europe. There, no one knows the tainted name you carry or the terrible burden tied to you. You may take the madwoman with you to England; confine her at Thornfield with appropriate care and precautions. Then travel wherever you wish and form whatever new connections you desire. That woman, who so abused your patience, so defiled your name, so violated your honour, so ruined your youth, is not your wife, nor are you her husband. Ensure she is looked after as her condition requires, and you will have fulfilled all that God and humanity demand of you. Let her identity and her connection to you be buried in secrecy.

My father and brother had not made my marriage known to their acquaintance; because, in the very first letter I wrote to apprise them of the union—having already begun to experience extreme disgust of its consequences, and, from the family character and constitution, seeing a hideous future opening to me—I added an urgent charge to keep it secret: and very soon the infamous conduct of the wife my father had selected for me was such as to make him blush to own her as his daughter-in-law. Far from desiring to publish the connection, he became as anxious to conceal it as myself.\n“To England, then, I conveyed her; a fearful voyage I had with such a monster in the vessel. Glad was I when I at last got her to Thornfield, and saw her safely lodged in that third-storey room, of whose secret inner cabinet she has now for ten years made a wild beast’s den—a goblin’s cell. I had some trouble in finding an attendant for her, as it was necessary to select one on whose fidelity dependence could be placed; for her ravings would inevitably betray my secret: besides, she had lucid intervals of days—sometimes weeks—which she filled up with abuse of me. At last I hired Grace Poole from the Grimbsy Retreat. She and the surgeon, Carter (who dressed Mason’s wounds that night he was stabbed and worried), are the only two I have ever admitted to my confidence. Mrs. Fairfax may indeed have suspected something, but she could have gained no precise knowledge as to facts. Grace has, on the whole, proved a good keeper; though, owing partly to a fault of her own, of which it appears nothing can cure her, and which is incident to her harassing profession, her vigilance has been more than once lulled and baffled. The lunatic is both cunning and malignant; she has never failed to take advantage of her guardian’s temporary lapses; once to secrete the knife with which she stabbed her brother, and twice to possess herself of the key of her cell, and issue therefrom in the night-time. On the first of these occasions, she perpetrated the attempt to burn me in my bed; on the second, she paid that ghastly visit to you. I thank Providence, who watched over you, that she then spent her fury on your wedding apparel, which perhaps brought back vague reminiscences of her own bridal days: but on what might have happened, I cannot endure to reflect. When I think of the thing which flew at my throat this morning, hanging its black and scarlet visage over the nest of my dove, my blood curdles—”\n“And what, sir,” I asked, while he paused, “did you do when you had settled her here? Where did you go?”\n“What did I do, Jane? I transformed myself into a will-o’-the-wisp. Where did I go? I pursued wanderings as wild as those of the March-spirit. I sought the Continent, and went devious through all its lands. My fixed desire was to seek and find a good and intelligent woman, whom I could love: a contrast to the fury I left at Thornfield—”\n“But you could not marry, sir.”\n“I had determined and was convinced that I could and ought. It was not my original intention to deceive, as I have deceived you. I meant to tell my tale plainly, and make my proposals openly: and it appeared to me so absolutely rational that I should be considered free to love and be loved, I never doubted some woman might be found willing and able to understand my case and accept me, in spite of the curse with which I was burdened.”\n“Well, sir?”\n“When you are inquisitive, Jane, you always make me smile. You open your eyes like an eager bird, and make every now and then a restless movement, as if answers in speech did not flow fast enough for you, and you wanted to read the tablet of one’s heart. But before I go on, tell me what you mean by your ‘Well, sir?’ It is a small phrase very frequent with you; and which many a time has drawn me on and on through interminable talk: I don’t very well know why.”\n“I mean,—What next? How did you proceed? What came of such an event?”\n“Precisely! and what do you wish to know now?”\n“Whether you found any one you liked: whether you asked her to marry you; and what she said.”\n“I can tell you whether I found any one I liked, and whether I asked her to marry me: but what she said is yet to be recorded in the book of Fate. For ten long years I roved about, living first in one capital, then another: sometimes in St. Petersburg; oftener in Paris; occasionally in Rome, Naples, and Florence. Provided with plenty of money and the passport of an old name, I could choose my own society: no circles were closed against me. I sought my ideal of a woman amongst English ladies, French countesses, Italian signoras, and German gräfinnen. I could not find her. Sometimes, for a fleeting moment, I thought I caught a glance, heard a tone, beheld a form, which announced the realisation of my dream: but I was presently undeceived. You are not to suppose that I desired perfection, either of mind or person. I longed only for what suited me—for the antipodes of the Creole: and I longed vainly. Amongst them all I found not one whom, had I been ever so free, I—warned as I was of the risks, the horrors, the loathings of incongruous unions—would have asked to marry me. Disappointment made me reckless. I tried dissipation—never debauchery: that I hated, and hate. That was my Indian Messalina’s attribute: rooted disgust at it and her restrained me much, even in pleasure. Any enjoyment that bordered on riot seemed to approach me to her and her vices, and I eschewed it.\n“Yet I could not live alone; so I tried the companionship of mistresses. The first I chose was Céline Varens—another of those steps which make a man spurn himself when he recalls them. You already know what she was, and how my liaison with her terminated. She had two successors: an Italian, Giacinta, and a German, Clara; both considered singularly handsome. What was their beauty to me in a few weeks? Giacinta was unprincipled and violent: I tired of her in three months. Clara was honest and quiet; but heavy, mindless, and unimpressible: not one whit to my taste. I was glad to give her a sufficient sum to set her up in a good line of business, and so get decently rid of her. But, Jane, I see by your face you are not forming a very favourable opinion of me just now. You think me an unfeeling, loose-principled rake: don’t you?”\n“I don’t like you so well as I have done sometimes, indeed, sir. Did it not seem to you in the least wrong to live in that way, first with one mistress and then another? You talk of it as a mere matter of course.”\n“It was with me; and I did not like it. It was a grovelling fashion of existence: I should never like to return to it. Hiring a mistress is the next worse thing to buying a slave: both are often by nature, and always by position, inferior: and to live familiarly with inferiors is degrading. I now hate the recollection of the time I passed with Céline, Giacinta, and Clara.”\nI felt the truth of these words; and I drew from them the certain inference, that if I were so far to forget myself and all the teaching that had ever been instilled into me, as—under any pretext—with any justification—through any temptation—to become the successor of these poor girls, he would one day regard me with the same feeling which now in his mind desecrated their memory. I did not give utterance to this conviction: it was enough to feel it. I impressed it on my heart, that it might remain there to serve me as aid in the time of trial.\n“Now, Jane, why don’t you say ‘Well, sir?’ I have not done. You are looking grave. You disapprove of me still, I see. But let me come to the point. Last January, rid of all mistresses—in a harsh, bitter frame of mind, the result of a useless, roving, lonely life—corroded with disappointment, sourly disposed against all men, and especially against all womankind (for I began to regard the notion of an intellectual, faithful, loving woman as a mere dream), recalled by business, I came back to England.\n“On a frosty winter afternoon, I rode in sight of Thornfield Hall. Abhorred spot! I expected no peace—no pleasure there. On a stile in Hay Lane I saw a quiet little figure sitting by itself. I passed it as negligently as I did the pollard willow opposite to it: I had no presentiment of what it would be to me; no inward warning that the arbitress of my life—my genius for good or evil—waited there in humble guise. I did not know it, even when, on the occasion of Mesrour’s accident, it came up and gravely offered me help. Childish and slender creature! It seemed as if a linnet had hopped to my foot and proposed to bear me on its tiny wing. I was surly; but the thing would not go: it stood by me with strange perseverance, and looked and spoke with a sort of authority. I must be aided, and by that hand: and aided I was.\n“When once I had pressed the frail shoulder, something new—a fresh sap and sense—stole into my frame. It was well I had learnt that this elf must return to me—that it belonged to my house down below—or I could not have felt it pass away from under my hand, and seen it vanish behind the dim hedge, without singular regret. I heard you come home that night, Jane, though probably you were not aware that I thought of you or watched for you. The next day I observed you—myself unseen—for half-an-hour, while you played with Adèle in the gallery. It was a snowy day, I recollect, and you could not go out of doors. I was in my room; the door was ajar: I could both listen and watch. Adèle claimed your outward attention for a while; yet I fancied your thoughts were elsewhere: but you were very patient with her, my little Jane; you talked to her and amused her a long time. When at last she left you, you lapsed at once into deep reverie: you betook yourself slowly to pace the gallery. Now and then, in passing a casement, you glanced out at the thick-falling snow; you listened to the sobbing wind, and again you paced gently on and dreamed. I think those day visions were not dark: there was a pleasurable illumination in your eye occasionally, a soft excitement in your aspect, which told of no bitter, bilious, hypochondriac brooding: your look revealed rather the sweet musings of youth when its spirit follows on willing wings the flight of Hope up and on to an ideal heaven. The voice of Mrs. Fairfax, speaking to a servant in the hall, wakened you: and how curiously you smiled to and at yourself, Janet! There was much sense in your smile: it was very shrewd, and seemed to make light of your own abstraction. It seemed to say—‘My fine visions are all very well, but I must not forget they are absolutely unreal. I have a rosy sky and a green flowery Eden in my brain; but without, I am perfectly aware, lies at my feet a rough tract to travel, and around me gather black tempests to encounter.’ You ran downstairs and demanded of Mrs. Fairfax some occupation: the weekly house accounts to make up, or something of that sort, I think it was. I was vexed with you for getting out of my sight.",
          "paraphrase_gemini-2.5-flash-preview-04-17": "I followed this idea precisely. My father and brother hadn't shared news of my marriage with their acquaintances because, in the very first letter I sent informing them – already experiencing intense regret about its consequences and seeing a dreadful future due to my wife's family history and disposition – I strongly urged them to keep it quiet. Before long, the disgraceful behaviour of the woman my father had chosen for me made him ashamed to acknowledge her as his daughter-in-law. Far from wanting the connection public, he became as eager to hide it as I was. I transported her to England, enduring a terrifying sea journey with such a monstrous person. I was relieved when I finally got her to Thornfield and saw her securely settled in that third-floor room, which for the past ten years she has turned into a wild animal's lair – a spirit's prison. Finding someone to attend her was difficult, as I needed someone completely trustworthy, because her fits of madness would undoubtedly expose my secret. Besides, she had clear periods, sometimes lasting days or weeks, which she spent verbally abusing me. Eventually, I hired Grace Poole from the Grimbsy Retreat. She and the surgeon, Carter (who treated Mason's injuries that night he was stabbed and attacked), are the only two people I've ever fully confided in. Mrs. Fairfax might have suspected something, but she couldn't have known the exact facts. Overall, Grace has proven to be a good keeper, although due partly to a persistent flaw in her character that seems incurable and is related to her stressful job, her watchfulness has been overcome and defeated more than once. The lunatic is both cunning and malicious; she has never failed to exploit her guardian's temporary inattentiveness. She once hid the knife she used to stab her brother, and twice managed to get hold of the key to her room and get out at night. During the first escape, she attempted to burn me in my bed; on the second, she made that horrifying visit to you. I thank Providence, who protected you, that she directed her rage at your wedding dress, which perhaps brought back faint memories of her own wedding days. But I cannot bear to think about what could have happened. When I recall the creature that attacked my throat this morning, its black and scarlet face hanging over the sanctuary of my loved one, my blood runs cold –\" \"And what, sir,\" I asked during his pause, \"did you do after you had established her here? Where did you go?\" \"What did I do, Jane? I transformed myself into a wandering light. Where did I go? I pursued journeys as erratic as a restless spirit's. I sought the Continent and travelled aimlessly through all its countries. My firm desire was to find and secure a good, intelligent woman whom I could love: a complete opposite to the fury I left at Thornfield –\" \"But you could not marry, sir.\" \"I had decided and was convinced that I could and should. It was not my initial intention to deceive, as I have deceived you. I planned to tell my story plainly and make my proposals honestly. And it seemed so utterly reasonable to me that I should be considered free to love and be loved that I never doubted I could find a woman willing and able to understand my situation and accept me, despite the burden I carried.\" \"Well, sir?\" \"When you are curious, Jane, you always make me smile. You widen your eyes like an eager bird and make restless movements now and then, as if spoken answers aren't quick enough for you and you want to read someone's heart. But before I continue, tell me what you mean by your 'Well, sir?' It's a short phrase you use often, and it's frequently led me on and on through endless conversations; I'm not entirely sure why.\" \"I mean – What next? How did you proceed? What came of that situation?\" \"Exactly! And what do you wish to know now?\" \"Whether you found anyone you liked, whether you proposed marriage, and what she said.\" \"I can tell you whether I found anyone I liked and whether I asked her to marry me; but what she said has yet to be written in the book of Destiny. For ten long years I wandered, living first in one capital, then another: sometimes in St. Petersburg, more often in Paris, occasionally in Rome, Naples, and Florence. With ample funds and the status of an old family name, I could choose my companions; no social circles were closed to me. I sought my ideal woman among English ladies, French countesses, Italian signoras, and German countesses. I could not find her. Sometimes, for a brief moment, I thought I caught a look, heard a voice, saw a form that signaled the realization of my dream, but I was quickly disappointed. You mustn't think I was looking for perfection, either physically or mentally. I only longed for what suited me – for the opposite of the Creole – and I longed in vain. Among them all, I found not one whom, even if I had been completely free – warned as I was of the risks, the horrors, the disgust of unsuitable unions – I would have asked to marry me. Disappointment made me reckless. I sought distraction – never vice, which I hated and still hate. That was a characteristic of my Indian Messalina; deep revulsion towards it and her greatly restrained me, even in pleasure. Any enjoyment bordering on excess seemed to bring me closer to her and her flaws, so I avoided it. \"Yet I couldn't live alone, so I attempted the companionship of mistresses. The first I chose was Céline Varens – another one of those actions that make a man despise himself when he remembers them. You already know what she was like and how my relationship with her ended. She had two who came after her: an Italian, Giacinta, and a German, Clara; both considered exceptionally beautiful. What did their beauty mean to me after a few weeks? Giacinta was immoral and hot-tempered; I grew tired of her in three months. Clara was honest and calm but dull, unintelligent, and unresponsive; not at all to my liking. I was glad to give her a substantial sum to help her start a respectable business and thus get rid of her properly. But, Jane, I can see from your expression that you aren't forming a very positive opinion of me right now. You think I'm an unfeeling, immoral rake, don't you?\" \"I don't like you as much as I sometimes have, indeed, sir. Did it not seem wrong to you in the slightest to live that way, first with one mistress and then another? You speak of it as if it were perfectly normal.\" \"It was normal for me at the time, and I didn't enjoy it. It was a base way of living; I would never want to return to it. Employing a mistress is the second-worst thing to buying a slave; both are often naturally, and always by their situation, inferior, and living intimately with inferiors is demeaning. I now detest the memory of the time I spent with Céline, Giacinta, and Clara.\" I felt the truth of these words, and from them, I drew the certain conclusion that if I were to so forget myself and all the lessons I had ever been taught as to – under any excuse, with any justification, through any temptation – become the successor to these poor girls, he would one day regard me with the same feeling that now desecrated their memory in his mind. I didn't voice this realization; it was enough to feel it. I etched it onto my heart so it would remain there to help me in times of difficulty. \"Now, Jane, why don't you say 'Well, sir?' I haven't finished. You look serious. I see you still disapprove of me. But let me get to the point. Last January, free of all mistresses – in a harsh, bitter state of mind, the result of a useless, wandering, lonely life – corroded by disappointment, resentful towards all men, and especially towards all women (for I had begun to view the idea of an intellectual, faithful, loving woman as a mere fantasy), recalled by business matters, I returned to England. \"On a frosty winter afternoon, I rode into view of Thornfield Hall. That detested place! I expected no peace, no pleasure there. On a stile in Hay Lane, I saw a quiet little figure sitting alone. I passed it as carelessly as I did the lopped willow tree opposite it. I had no premonition of what it would mean to me, no inner warning that the arbiter of my life – my influence for good or ill – waited there in humble form. I didn't realize it, even when, on the occasion of Mesrour's accident, it came forward and solemnly offered me help. Such a childlike and fragile creature! It seemed as though a small bird had hopped to my foot and proposed to carry me on its tiny wing. I was grumpy, but the creature wouldn't leave; it stood by me with strange persistence and looked and spoke with a kind of authority. I had to be helped, and by that hand; and helped I was. \"Once I had pressed that delicate shoulder, something new – a fresh vitality and sensation – stole into my being. It was fortunate I had learned that this sprite had to return to me – that it belonged to my home below – or I couldn't have felt it leave from under my hand and seen it disappear behind the indistinct hedge without profound regret. I heard you come home that night, Jane, though you probably weren't aware that I was thinking of you or watching for you. The next day, I observed you – unseen myself – for half an hour while you played with Adèle in the gallery. It was a snowy day, I remember, and you couldn't go outdoors. I was in my room; the door was slightly open; I could both listen and watch. Adèle demanded your outward attention for a while, yet I imagined your thoughts were elsewhere. But you were very patient with her, my little Jane; you talked to her and entertained her for a long time. When she finally left you, you immediately fell into deep contemplation; you began slowly pacing the gallery. Every now and then, passing a window, you glanced out at the thick snowfall; you listened to the sighing wind, and then you gently continued pacing and dreaming. I think those daytime visions weren't dark; there was occasionally a pleasant light in your eyes, a gentle excitement in your appearance, which indicated no bitter, irritable, melancholic brooding. Your look revealed instead the sweet daydreams of youth when its spirit willingly follows the flight of Hope upwards towards an ideal heaven. The voice of Mrs. Fairfax, speaking to a servant in the hall, woke you, and how curiously you smiled to yourself, Janet! There was much wisdom in your smile; it was very perceptive and seemed to dismiss your own absorption lightly. It seemed to say – 'My beautiful visions are all well and good, but I must not forget they are completely unreal. I have a rosy sky and a green, flowery paradise in my mind; but outside, I am perfectly aware, lies a difficult path to travel at my feet, and around me gather black storms to face.' You ran downstairs and asked Mrs. Fairfax for something to do; the weekly household accounts to prepare, or something similar, I think it was. I was annoyed with you for leaving my sight.",
          "paraphrase_gpt-4.1-2025-04-14": "I followed this course of action exactly as suggested. My father and brother hadn’t announced my marriage publicly; when I first wrote to tell them of it, I was already beginning to feel deep regret and dread for what I’d gotten into and, predicting only a terrible future from what I knew of my wife’s background and temperament, I insisted they keep it completely quiet. Soon enough, my wife’s disgraceful behaviour was so mortifying, my father was ashamed to acknowledge her as part of the family. Rather than wanting to make our marriage known, he was as eager as I was to keep it secret.\n\nI brought her with me to England—a dreadful journey, considering how wretched she was to travel with. When I finally brought her to Thornfield and had her locked away in that third-floor room—the one she’s turned into a kind of maddened animal’s lair for ten years—I felt some relief. It was hard to find someone trustworthy to look after her, since any slip could expose my secret, and in her bouts of clarity, she would spend days or weeks insulting me. Eventually, I hired Grace Poole from the Grimbsy Retreat. She and the doctor, Carter—who treated Mason when he was attacked—are the only ones I ever fully trusted with the truth. Mrs. Fairfax may have suspected something was amiss, but she had no clear facts. Grace Poole has been a capable keeper, though sometimes, out of her own carelessness—something she cannot seem to overcome—she’s failed in her vigilance. My wife is both spiteful and cunning and always found ways to exploit Grace’s lapses: once stealing the knife she used to stab her brother, twice getting hold of the key to her room and escaping at night. One time, she tried to set fire to my bed; another, she made that horrific visit to you. I thank God she only wrecked your wedding dress, which probably reminded her vaguely of her own wedding; but I shudder to imagine what might have happened instead. When I think about her attacking me this morning and hovering, wild-looking, by your bed, it chills my blood.\n\n\"And what did you do once you settled her here? Where did you go?\" you asked.\n\n\"What did I do, Jane? I became a wanderer, drifting wherever fate took me. I traveled all over Europe, searching for a good and intelligent woman I could love—someone completely unlike the wife I’d left at Thornfield.\"\n\n\"But you couldn’t marry, sir,\" you reminded me.\n\n\"I decided, and persuaded myself, that I could and should. I didn’t intend at first to deceive, as I have with you; I planned to be open about my situation and make honest proposals. It seemed to me so clearly reasonable that I should be considered free to love and be loved, despite the curse that burdened me, that I never doubted I’d find a woman who could understand and accept my position.\"\n\n\"Well, sir?\"\n\n\"Jane, your curiosity makes me smile. When you’re anxious for answers, your eyes light up and you move impatiently, as though words can’t come fast enough and you’re trying to guess what I’m thinking before I say it. But before I answer, tell me—what do you mean by your constant ‘Well, sir?’ You say it all the time and it always leads me into lengthy stories. I’m not sure why.\"\n\n\"I mean—what happened next? How did things proceed? What became of your quest?\"\n\n\"Exactly. And now, what do you want to know?\"\n\n\"Did you meet someone you liked? Did you propose to her? What did she say?\"\n\n\"I can tell you if I met anyone I liked and whether I proposed, but her reply is still unwritten in fate. For ten years I wandered through many cities—St. Petersburg, Paris, Rome, Naples, Florence. With money and a respected name, I could enter any society. I searched for my ideal among English ladies, French countesses, Italian signoras, and German countesses, but couldn’t find her. Occasionally, I thought I glimpsed my dream, but was soon disappointed. It wasn’t perfection I wanted, just someone suited to me—the complete opposite of my wife—but I searched in vain. None of them, even if I had been truly free, would I have asked to marry me, knowing what I now do about marriage and regrets. This disappointment led me to reckless living. I tried distractions—never outright debauchery, which I despise. That was my wife’s vice, and my disgust for her and it kept me from vice, even when I was tempted. Any pleasure that seemed too wild reminded me of her and her sins, and I avoided it.\n\nStill, I couldn’t bear solitude, so I tried keeping mistresses. My first was Céline Varens—you know the story and how that ended. After her were Giacinta, an Italian, and Clara, a German, both renowned for their beauty. But after only a short while, Giacinta’s lack of principles and temper made me end things. Clara was quiet and honest, but dull and uninspiring—she simply wasn’t my type. I was glad to give her enough money to start a business and part ways. But I can tell you aren’t thinking very highly of me right now. You probably consider me callous and unprincipled, yes?\"\n\n\"Indeed, sir, I like you less than I have at other times. Didn’t it ever strike you as wrong to live like that—from one mistress to another? You speak of it as if it were completely normal.\"\n\n\"It was for me; though I disliked it. It was a degrading way of living, and I wouldn’t return to it. Having a mistress is almost as bad as owning a slave: they’re usually, by both nature and circumstance, beneath one’s own level, and living closely with inferiors is degrading. I now detest that period of my life with Céline, Giacinta, and Clara.\"\n\nI believed the truth of his words, and drew a lesson from them: if I were ever persuaded—through any excuse or temptation—to become the successor of those women, he would eventually feel the same contempt for me that he now feels for their memory. I didn’t say this out loud, but I made sure to remember it well as a warning for the future.\n\n\"Now, Jane, you’re not saying ‘Well, sir?’ I’m not done yet. You look serious, still disapproving. But let me finish. Last January, finally rid of all mistresses, bitter and completely disillusioned after a lonely, wandering life, my mind soured against all people, especially women—I began to think the idea of a smart, caring woman was just a fantasy—I came back to England for business reasons.\n\n\"One cold winter afternoon, I saw Thornfield Hall from a distance—dreaded place! I expected no happiness there. At a gate on Hay Lane, I saw a small, quiet figure sitting alone. I paid it little attention—no more than to the old tree nearby. I had no premonition that the person I saw would become so important to me. I didn’t realize, even after the incident with Mesrour, when she quietly came to help me, what she would mean. She was fragile and young, but persistent and strangely authoritative. I needed her help, and she gave it.\n\n\"The moment I leaned on her thin shoulder, something new came into my life. It was good that I knew the ‘elf’ would return to Thornfield, or I would have regretted seeing her go. I heard you come home that night, Jane, though you didn’t know it. The next day, I watched you with Adèle as you played together inside because it was snowing. I observed, unseen, for half an hour. Although Adèle needed your attention, I could tell your thoughts were elsewhere; still, you were extremely patient and affectionate with her. Once she left, you fell into deep thought, pacing the hall, peering out at the snow, listening to the wind, and daydreaming. You seemed happy and hopeful, your eyes bright, not weighed down by gloom. Mrs. Fairfax’s voice woke you from your reverie, and you smiled knowingly at yourself, as if reminding yourself that daydreams aren’t reality; your life, outside your mind, would be challenging, with difficulties ahead. You promptly went to find some work—household accounts or something similar. I was annoyed to lose sight of you."

          "text_segment": "“Impatiently I waited for evening, when I might summon you to my presence. An unusual—to me—a perfectly new character I suspected was yours: I desired to search it deeper and know it better. You entered the room with a look and air at once shy and independent: you were quaintly dressed—much as you are now. I made you talk: ere long I found you full of strange contrasts. Your garb and manner were restricted by rule; your air was often diffident, and altogether that of one refined by nature, but absolutely unused to society, and a good deal afraid of making herself disadvantageously conspicuous by some solecism or blunder; yet when addressed, you lifted a keen, a daring, and a glowing eye to your interlocutor’s face: there was penetration and power in each glance you gave; when plied by close questions, you found ready and round answers. Very soon you seemed to get used to me: I believe you felt the existence of sympathy between you and your grim and cross master, Jane; for it was astonishing to see how quickly a certain pleasant ease tranquillised your manner: snarl as I would, you showed no surprise, fear, annoyance, or displeasure at my moroseness; you watched me, and now and then smiled at me with a simple yet sagacious grace I cannot describe. I was at once content and stimulated with what I saw: I liked what I had seen, and wished to see more. Yet, for a long time, I treated you distantly, and sought your company rarely. I was an intellectual epicure, and wished to prolong the gratification of making this novel and piquant acquaintance: besides, I was for a while troubled with a haunting fear that if I handled the flower freely its bloom would fade—the sweet charm of freshness would leave it. I did not then know that it was no transitory blossom, but rather the radiant resemblance of one, cut in an indestructible gem. Moreover, I wished to see whether you would seek me if I shunned you—but you did not; you kept in the schoolroom as still as your own desk and easel; if by chance I met you, you passed me as soon, and with as little token of recognition, as was consistent with respect. Your habitual expression in those days, Jane, was a thoughtful look; not despondent, for you were not sickly; but not buoyant, for you had little hope, and no actual pleasure. I wondered what you thought of me, or if you ever thought of me, and resolved to find this out.\n“I resumed my notice of you. There was something glad in your glance, and genial in your manner, when you conversed: I saw you had a social heart; it was the silent schoolroom—it was the tedium of your life—that made you mournful. I permitted myself the delight of being kind to you; kindness stirred emotion soon: your face became soft in expression, your tones gentle; I liked my name pronounced by your lips in a grateful happy accent. I used to enjoy a chance meeting with you, Jane, at this time: there was a curious hesitation in your manner: you glanced at me with a slight trouble—a hovering doubt: you did not know what my caprice might be—whether I was going to play the master and be stern, or the friend and be benignant. I was now too fond of you often to simulate the first whim; and, when I stretched my hand out cordially, such bloom and light and bliss rose to your young, wistful features, I had much ado often to avoid straining you then and there to my heart.”\n“Don’t talk any more of those days, sir,” I interrupted, furtively dashing away some tears from my eyes; his language was torture to me; for I knew what I must do—and do soon—and all these reminiscences, and these revelations of his feelings only made my work more difficult.\n“No, Jane,” he returned: “what necessity is there to dwell on the Past, when the Present is so much surer—the Future so much brighter?”\nI shuddered to hear the infatuated assertion.\n“You see now how the case stands—do you not?” he continued. “After a youth and manhood passed half in unutterable misery and half in dreary solitude, I have for the first time found what I can truly love—I have found you. You are my sympathy—my better self—my good angel. I am bound to you with a strong attachment. I think you good, gifted, lovely: a fervent, a solemn passion is conceived in my heart; it leans to you, draws you to my centre and spring of life, wraps my existence about you, and, kindling in pure, powerful flame, fuses you and me in one.\n“It was because I felt and knew this, that I resolved to marry you. To tell me that I had already a wife is empty mockery: you know now that I had but a hideous demon. I was wrong to attempt to deceive you; but I feared a stubbornness that exists in your character. I feared early instilled prejudice: I wanted to have you safe before hazarding confidences. This was cowardly: I should have appealed to your nobleness and magnanimity at first, as I do now—opened to you plainly my life of agony—described to you my hunger and thirst after a higher and worthier existence—shown to you, not my resolution (that word is weak), but my resistless bent to love faithfully and well, where I am faithfully and well loved in return. Then I should have asked you to accept my pledge of fidelity and to give me yours. Jane—give it me now.”",
          "paraphrase_gemini-2.5-flash-preview-04-17": "I eagerly awaited evening, when I could call you to me. I suspected you possessed an unusual, for me, an entirely new kind of character; I wanted to delve deeper and understand it better. You entered the room looking both shy and self-possessed, dressed in a peculiar way, much as you are now. I encouraged you to speak, and before long, I found you full of striking contradictions. Your clothes and demeanor seemed governed by rules; you often appeared hesitant, generally resembling someone naturally refined but completely inexperienced in social situations, and quite apprehensive of attracting negative attention with a mistake or awkwardness. Yet, when spoken to, you looked up at your questioner with sharp, bold, and bright eyes. There was insight and strength in every look you gave, and when pressed with detailed questions, you provided quick and clear answers. You seemed to grow comfortable with me very quickly; I believe you felt a sense of connection between you and your stern and difficult master, Jane, because it was astonishing how quickly a pleasant calmness settled over your manner. No matter how I scowled, you showed no surprise, fear, annoyance, or unhappiness at my bad temper. You watched me, and sometimes smiled with a simple but wise grace that I cannot describe. I was simultaneously satisfied and intrigued by what I saw; I liked what I had observed and desired to see more. Nevertheless, for a long time, I kept my distance and sought your company infrequently. I was like someone who savours intellectual delights, wanting to extend the pleasure of making this new and interesting acquaintance. Besides, I was for a while troubled by a persistent fear that if I handled this 'flower' too freely, its beauty would fade, losing its sweet, fresh charm. I didn't realize then that you were not a fleeting blossom, but rather the brilliant image of one, carved from an indestructible jewel. Furthermore, I wanted to see if you would seek me out if I avoided you—but you did not. You stayed as still in the schoolroom as your desk and easel. If we met by chance, you passed me quickly, showing only the minimal sign of recognition required by respect. Your usual expression in those days, Jane, was thoughtful; not sad, because you were not unwell, but not cheerful either, because you had little hope and no genuine happiness. I wondered what you thought of me, or if you ever thought of me, and resolved to find out. I began to observe you again. There was a joyful quality in your gaze and a warm friendliness in your manner when you spoke. I saw you had a social heart; it was the quiet schoolroom—the monotony of your life—that made you seem downcast. I allowed myself the pleasure of being kind to you; kindness soon awakened emotion. Your face became soft, your voice gentle; I liked hearing you pronounce my name with a grateful, happy tone. I used to enjoy chance meetings with you then, Jane. There was a peculiar hesitation in your behaviour; you glanced at me with a slight unease—a lingering uncertainty. You didn't know what my mood might be—whether I would act like the stern master or the benevolent friend. By this time, I was too fond of you to often pretend to be stern; and when I offered my hand warmly, such radiance, brightness, and joy appeared on your young, yearning face that I often had great difficulty preventing myself from pulling you into an embrace right there and then.”\n“Don’t talk about those days anymore, sir,” I interrupted, secretly wiping away tears; his words were agonizing for me, because I knew what I had to do—and soon—and all these memories, and these revelations of his feelings, only made my task harder.\n“No, Jane,” he replied, “why dwell on the Past, when the Present is so much more certain—the Future so much brighter?” I shivered hearing his deluded statement.\n“You see how things stand now—don’t you?” he continued. “After a youth and manhood spent half in unspeakable misery and half in bleak solitude, I have for the first time found someone I can truly love—I have found you. You are my emotional connection—my better self—my good angel. I am tied to you by a powerful bond. I think you are good, talented, lovely; a fervent, a solemn passion has formed in my heart. It inclines towards you, pulls you to the core and source of my life, envelops my existence around you, and, igniting in a pure, strong flame, fuses you and me into one.\n“It was because I felt and knew this that I decided to marry you. To say that I already had a wife is empty nonsense; you know now that what I had was merely a horrifying demon. I was wrong to try and deceive you, but I feared a stubbornness that is part of your character. I feared prejudices instilled early on; I wanted to secure you before risking confidences. This was cowardly; I should have appealed to your nobility and generosity from the beginning, as I am doing now—honestly revealed my life of suffering to you—described my intense longing for a higher, worthier existence—shown you, not my decision (that word is weak), but my irresistible impulse to love faithfully and well, where I am loved faithfully and well in return. Then I should have asked you to accept my promise of loyalty and give me yours. Jane—give it to me now.”",
          "paraphrase_gpt-4.1-2025-04-14": "I impatiently waited for evening so I could call you to me. I sensed there was something unique and unfamiliar in your character, and I wanted to learn more. When you entered, you were shy yet self-reliant, dressed in an unusual fashion, much as you are now. I encouraged you to speak and soon discovered that you were full of unexpected contrasts. Your clothes and behavior were clearly shaped by rules; your manner was modest, as if refined by nature but inexperienced in society, somewhat anxious about making a mistake. Yet, when spoken to, your gaze was sharp, bold, and vibrant, showing intelligence and strength; you answered difficult questions with ease and confidence. Quickly, you became comfortable around me; I believe you sensed a connection between us, Jane, even though I could be stern and distant. You handled my gruffness calmly, showing no fear or annoyance, instead observing me and sometimes smiling at me with a simple, perceptive charm I can hardly describe. I found myself both satisfied and pleasantly intrigued by you, enjoying what I saw and wanting more. Still, for some time, I kept my distance and rarely sought your company. Like a gourmet savoring a rare treat, I wanted to prolong this interesting new acquaintance. I also worried that if I got too close, the charm might vanish—that the freshness would fade if I handled it carelessly. I didn’t yet realize that your qualities were lasting, like a precious gem. I even tested whether you would seek me out if I avoided you, but you did not; you stayed quietly in the schoolroom, hardly acknowledging me except as was polite. Then, your usual expression was thoughtful but not sad, as you weren’t weak, nor hopeful, as you had little to look forward to and few pleasures. I wondered what you thought of me, or if you ever thought of me, and decided to find out.\nI started paying attention to you again. Your eyes were bright, and you were kind in conversation; I saw you had a sociable spirit. It was the silence and monotony of your life that made you seem sad. I let myself enjoy being kind to you, and you responded with gentleness and warmth; I liked hearing you say my name in a grateful tone. I enjoyed our chance encounters—your slight uncertainty and doubt about whether I would be harsh or friendly. By then, I was too fond of you to pretend to be stern very often; and when I was kind, joy would light up your face so much that I often had to restrain myself from embracing you.\n“Please stop talking about those days, sir,” I interrupted, discreetly wiping away tears; his words pained me, for I knew what I must soon do, and reminiscing only made my task harder.\n“No, Jane,” he replied, “why dwell on the past when the present is so secure and the future so bright?”\nI shuddered at his passionate claim.\n“You see the situation now, don’t you?” he continued. “After a lifetime of misery and loneliness, I have finally found someone I truly love—you. You are my soulmate, my better half, my guiding spirit. I feel deeply connected to you; I think you are good, talented, and beautiful. I have a profound, solemn love for you; it pulls you to me and surrounds my life with yours, uniting us as one.\n“It was this feeling that made me want to marry you. To say that I already have a wife is meaningless: what I had was a monster. I was wrong to deceive you, but I was afraid of your strong will and deep-rooted beliefs. I wanted you to be mine before risking honesty. That was cowardly; I should have appealed to your generosity from the beginning, revealed my painful life, described my longing for a better existence, and shown you the strength—not mere resolution, which is too weak a word—of my love for you, as strong and lasting as yours for me. Then I would have asked you for a mutual promise of loyalty. Give me that promise now, Jane.”"

          "text_segment": "A pause.\n“Why are you silent, Jane?”\nI was experiencing an ordeal: a hand of fiery iron grasped my vitals. Terrible moment: full of struggle, blackness, burning! Not a human being that ever lived could wish to be loved better than I was loved; and him who thus loved me I absolutely worshipped: and I must renounce love and idol. One drear word comprised my intolerable duty—“Depart!”\n“Jane, you understand what I want of you? Just this promise—‘I will be yours, Mr. Rochester.’”\n“Mr. Rochester, I will not be yours.”\nAnother long silence.\n“Jane!” recommenced he, with a gentleness that broke me down with grief, and turned me stone-cold with ominous terror—for this still voice was the pant of a lion rising—“Jane, do you mean to go one way in the world, and to let me go another?”\n“I do.”\n“Jane” (bending towards and embracing me), “do you mean it now?”\n“I do.”\n“And now?” softly kissing my forehead and cheek.\n“I do,” extricating myself from restraint rapidly and completely.\n“Oh, Jane, this is bitter! This—this is wicked. It would not be wicked to love me.”\n“It would to obey you.”\nA wild look raised his brows—crossed his features: he rose; but he forebore yet. I laid my hand on the back of a chair for support: I shook, I feared—but I resolved.\n“One instant, Jane. Give one glance to my horrible life when you are gone. All happiness will be torn away with you. What then is left? For a wife I have but the maniac upstairs: as well might you refer me to some corpse in yonder churchyard. What shall I do, Jane? Where turn for a companion and for some hope?”\n“Do as I do: trust in God and yourself. Believe in heaven. Hope to meet again there.”\n“Then you will not yield?”\n“No.”\n“Then you condemn me to live wretched and to die accursed?” His voice rose.\n“I advise you to live sinless, and I wish you to die tranquil.”\n“Then you snatch love and innocence from me? You fling me back on lust for a passion—vice for an occupation?”\n“Mr. Rochester, I no more assign this fate to you than I grasp at it for myself. We were born to strive and endure—you as well as I: do so. You will forget me before I forget you.”\n“You make me a liar by such language: you sully my honour. I declared I could not change: you tell me to my face I shall change soon. And what a distortion in your judgment, what a perversity in your ideas, is proved by your conduct! Is it better to drive a fellow-creature to despair than to transgress a mere human law, no man being injured by the breach? for you have neither relatives nor acquaintances whom you need fear to offend by living with me?”\nThis was true: and while he spoke my very conscience and reason turned traitors against me, and charged me with crime in resisting him. They spoke almost as loud as Feeling: and that clamoured wildly. “Oh, comply!” it said. “Think of his misery; think of his danger—look at his state when left alone; remember his headlong nature; consider the recklessness following on despair—soothe him; save him; love him; tell him you love him and will be his. Who in the world cares for you? or who will be injured by what you do?”\nStill indomitable was the reply—“I care for myself. The more solitary, the more friendless, the more unsustained I am, the more I will respect myself. I will keep the law given by God; sanctioned by man. I will hold to the principles received by me when I was sane, and not mad—as I am now. Laws and principles are not for the times when there is no temptation: they are for such moments as this, when body and soul rise in mutiny against their rigour; stringent are they; inviolate they shall be. If at my individual convenience I might break them, what would be their worth? They have a worth—so I have always believed; and if I cannot believe it now, it is because I am insane—quite insane: with my veins running fire, and my heart beating faster than I can count its throbs. Preconceived opinions, foregone determinations, are all I have at this hour to stand by: there I plant my foot.”",
          "paraphrase_gemini-2.5-flash-preview-04-17": "There was a pause.\nHe asked, “Why are you quiet, Jane?”\nI felt like I was undergoing a terrible trial: a burning metal hand seemed to grip my insides. It was a dreadful moment, filled with inner conflict, darkness, and intense pain! No person alive could ever wish to be loved more than I was; and I completely adored the man who loved me so much. Yet, I had to give up both this love and my idol. One harsh word summed up my unbearable duty—to \"Leave!\"\n“Jane, do you understand what I need from you? Just this promise—‘I will be yours, Mr. Rochester.’”\n“Mr. Rochester, I will not be yours.”\nAnother long silence followed.\n“Jane!” he started again, with a gentleness that overwhelmed me with sadness and made me feel chillingly cold with a frightening sense of dread—because this quiet tone sounded like the heavy breathing of a rising lion—\"Jane, do you intend for us to go our separate ways in the world?”\n“I do.”\n“Jane” (leaning towards me and holding me), “Do you still mean that now?”\n“I do.”\n“And now?” he asked, softly kissing my forehead and cheek.\n“I do,” I replied, pulling myself free from his hold quickly and completely.\n“Oh, Jane, this is painful! This—this is wrong. It wouldn’t be wrong to love me.”\n“It would be wrong to obey you.”\nA fierce look crossed his face and raised his eyebrows; he stood up, but held back for a moment. I put my hand on the back of a chair for support; I was trembling and afraid—but I was determined.\n“Wait a moment, Jane. Think about my awful life after you are gone. All happiness will be taken away with you. What will be left? For a wife, I only have the madwoman upstairs; I might as well point you to a corpse in the nearby graveyard. What should I do, Jane? Where can I find companionship and some hope?”\n“Do what I am doing: trust in God and yourself. Believe in heaven. Hope we can meet there again.”\n“So you won’t give in?”\n“No.”\n“Then you are condemning me to live a miserable life and die feeling cursed?” His voice grew louder.\n“I advise you to live without sin, and I hope you will die peacefully.”\n“Then you are taking love and innocence away from me? You are forcing me back towards lust for passion and vice for something to do?”\n“Mr. Rochester, I am no more forcing this fate on you than I am choosing it for myself. We were meant to struggle and endure—you just as much as I: do that. You will forget me before I forget you.”\n“Your words call me a liar; they stain my honor. I said I couldn’t change; you are telling me directly that I will change soon. And what a twisting of your judgment, what a warped view you have, is proven by what you are doing! Is it better to drive another person to despair than to break a simple human law, especially when no one is harmed by the break? You have no relatives or acquaintances you need worry about offending by living with me?”\nThis was true; and as he spoke, my very conscience and reason seemed to turn against me, accusing me of a crime for resisting him. They spoke almost as loudly as my feelings, which were crying out wildly. “Oh, agree!” my feelings said. “Think of his suffering; think of his danger—look how he’ll be if left alone; remember how impulsive he is; consider the recklessness that follows despair—comfort him; save him; love him; tell him you love him and will be his. Who in the world cares about you? Or who will be hurt by what you do?”\nYet my answer remained defiant—“I care about myself. The more alone, the more friendless, the less supported I am, the more I will respect myself. I will obey the law given by God; approved by man. I will stick to the principles I accepted when I was sensible, not insane—as I feel now. Laws and principles are not meant for times when there is no temptation; they are for moments like this, when my body and soul rebel against their strictness; they are severe; they must remain unbroken. If I could break them whenever it was convenient for me, what value would they have? They do have value—I have always believed that; and if I cannot believe it now, it is because I am insane—completely insane: with fire running through my veins, and my heart beating faster than I can count its beats. My pre-formed opinions and past decisions are all I have to rely on right now: that is where I stand firm.”\n",

It was a dreadful moment filled with conflict, darkness, and agony. No one in the world could wish to be loved more than I was loved, and I adored him in return; yet I had to give up both love and my idol. One bleak word described the painful duty ahead: \"Leave!\" \n\n\"Jane, do you know what I want from you? Just say, 'I will be yours, Mr. Rochester.'\" \n\n\"Mr. Rochester, I will not be yours.\" \n\nThere was another long silence. \n\nHe began again, now gently, and his tenderness made me feel overwhelmed with sorrow and a cold, haunting fear — because his quiet tone was like a ferocious beast ready to spring. \"Jane, do you intend to go one way in life and let me go another?\" \n\n\"I do.\" \n\n\"Jane,\" he said, as he leaned in and embraced me, \"do you mean it now?\" \n\n\"I do.\" \n\n\"And now?\" he whispered, kissing my forehead and cheek. \n\n\"I do,\" I replied, quickly freeing myself from his hold. \n\n\"Oh, Jane, this is so painful!

I leaned on the back of a chair for support, shaking and afraid, but determined.\n\n\"Just a moment, Jane. Imagine how miserable my life will be when you're gone. All happiness will vanish with you. What's left for me then? My only wife is the madwoman upstairs — you might as well suggest I marry someone dead in the churchyard. What should I do, Jane? Where can I find companionship or hope?\" \n\n\"Do what I do: trust in God and yourself. Believe in heaven. Hope that we'll meet there.\" \n\n\"So you won't give in?\" \n\n\"No.\" \n\n\"So you condemn me to misery in life and doom in death?\" he said, his voice rising. \n\n\"I advise you to live a good life and wish for you a peaceful death.\" \n\n\"So you take away love and innocence from me? You send me back to vice for comfort and temptation for company?\" \n\n\"Mr. Rochester, I don't wish that fate on you any more than I accept it for myself. Both of us are meant to struggle and endure — you as well as me. Do so. You'll forget me before I forget you.\" \n\n\"You're making me out to be a liar by saying that: you stain my honesty. I said I'd never change; you tell me straight to my face that I will soon. Is it really better to push someone to despair than to break a human-made law, when no one would actually be harmed? You don't have family or friends who would judge you if you became mine.\" \n\nHe was right; and as he spoke, my conscience and reason turned against me, accusing me of wrongdoing for resisting him. They almost drowned out my emotions, which screamed wildly: \"Just say yes! Think of his suffering, his hopelessness, his reckless spirit — comfort him; save him; love him; tell him you'll be his. Who else cares for you? Who would be hurt by this choice?\" \n\nYet my reply remained unbreakable: \"I care for myself. The lonelier, more friendless, and unsupported I am, the more I will respect myself. I will keep the law that comes from God as well as man. I will stand by the principles I learned when I was in my right mind, not as wild as I feel now. Laws and principles mean nothing if we only follow them when it's easy; they are for times like this, when every part of you wants to rebel. They are strict and must not be violated. If I could break them whenever it suited me, what good are they? They do have value — I've always believed that; if I can't believe it now, it's because I am in turmoil. All I have to hold onto are the beliefs and decisions I made before — and on those, I will stand firm.\""

          "text_segment": "I did. Mr. Rochester, reading my countenance, saw I had done so. His fury was wrought to the highest: he must yield to it for a moment, whatever followed; he crossed the floor and seized my arm and grasped my waist. He seemed to devour me with his flaming glance: physically, I felt, at the moment, powerless as stubble exposed to the draught and glow of a furnace: mentally, I still possessed my soul, and with it the certainty of ultimate safety. The soul, fortunately, has an interpreter—often an unconscious, but still a truthful interpreter—in the eye. My eye rose to his; and while I looked in his fierce face I gave an involuntary sigh; his gripe was painful, and my over-taxed strength almost exhausted.\n“Never,” said he, as he ground his teeth, “never was anything at once so frail and so indomitable. A mere reed she feels in my hand!” (And he shook me with the force of his hold.) “I could bend her with my finger and thumb: and what good would it do if I bent, if I uptore, if I crushed her? Consider that eye: consider the resolute, wild, free thing looking out of it, defying me, with more than courage—with a stern triumph. Whatever I do with its cage, I cannot get at it—the savage, beautiful creature! If I tear, if I rend the slight prison, my outrage will only let the captive loose. Conqueror I might be of the house; but the inmate would escape to heaven before I could call myself possessor of its clay dwelling-place. And it is you, spirit—with will and energy, and virtue and purity—that I want: not alone your brittle frame. Of yourself you could come with soft flight and nestle against my heart, if you would: seized against your will, you will elude the grasp like an essence—you will vanish ere I inhale your fragrance. Oh! come, Jane, come!”\nAs he said this, he released me from his clutch, and only looked at me. The look was far worse to resist than the frantic strain: only an idiot, however, would have succumbed now. I had dared and baffled his fury; I must elude his sorrow: I retired to the door.\n“You are going, Jane?”\n“I am going, sir.”\n“You are leaving me?”\n“Yes.”\n“You will not come? You will not be my comforter, my rescuer? My deep love, my wild woe, my frantic prayer, are all nothing to you?”\nWhat unutterable pathos was in his voice! How hard it was to reiterate firmly, “I am going.”\n“Jane!”\n“Mr. Rochester!”\n“Withdraw, then,—I consent; but remember, you leave me here in anguish. Go up to your own room; think over all I have said, and, Jane, cast a glance on my sufferings—think of me.”\nHe turned away; he threw himself on his face on the sofa. “Oh, Jane! my hope—my love—my life!” broke in anguish from his lips. Then came a deep, strong sob.\nI had already gained the door; but, reader, I walked back—walked back as determinedly as I had retreated. I knelt down by him; I turned his face from the cushion to me; I kissed his cheek; I smoothed his hair with my hand.\n“God bless you, my dear master!” I said. “God keep you from harm and wrong—direct you, solace you—reward you well for your past kindness to me.”\n“Little Jane’s love would have been my best reward,” he answered; “without it, my heart is broken. But Jane will give me her love: yes—nobly, generously.”\nUp the blood rushed to his face; forth flashed the fire from his eyes; erect he sprang; he held his arms out; but I evaded the embrace, and at once quitted the room.\n“Farewell!” was the cry of my heart as I left him. Despair added, “Farewell for ever!”\nThat night I never thought to sleep; but a slumber fell on me as soon as I lay down in bed. I was transported in thought to the scenes of childhood: I dreamt I lay in the red-room at Gateshead; that the night was dark, and my mind impressed with strange fears. The light that long ago had struck me into syncope, recalled in this vision, seemed glidingly to mount the wall, and tremblingly to pause in the centre of the obscured ceiling. I lifted up my head to look: the roof resolved to clouds, high and dim; the gleam was such as the moon imparts to vapours she is about to sever. I watched her come—watched with the strangest anticipation; as though some word of doom were to be written on her disk. She broke forth as never moon yet burst from cloud: a hand first penetrated the sable folds and waved them away; then, not a moon, but a white human form shone in the azure, inclining a glorious brow earthward. It gazed and gazed on me. It spoke to my spirit: immeasurably distant was the tone, yet so near, it whispered in my heart—\n“My daughter, flee temptation.”\n“Mother, I will.”",
          "paraphrase_gemini-2.5-flash-preview-04-17": "I did. Mr. Rochester saw I had, interpreting my expression. His rage reached its peak; he had to give in to it temporarily, whatever the outcome. He crossed the room, gripped my arm, and held my waist. He seemed to consume me with his fiery gaze. Physically, at that moment, I felt as weak as straw before the draft and heat of a furnace. Mentally, however, I kept possession of my spirit and, with it, the certainty of eventual safety. Fortunately, the soul has an interpreter – often an unconscious but truthful one – in the eye. My eyes met his, and as I looked into his fierce face, I sighed involuntarily. His grip was painful, and my strength, pushed beyond its limit, was nearly spent. \"Never,\" he said, grinding his teeth, \"was anything simultaneously so fragile and so impossible to conquer. In my hand, she feels like nothing more than a reed!\" (And he shook me forcefully with his grip.) \"I could bend her with just my finger and thumb, but what good would that do if I bent, tore, or crushed her? Consider that eye; consider the determined, wild, independent thing looking out of it, defying me with more than courage – with a stern victory. Whatever I do to its 'cage,' I cannot reach it – the wild, beautiful creature! If I tear or break the flimsy prison, my violence will only set the captive free. I might conquer the body, but the spirit would escape to heaven before I could claim possession of its earthly dwelling. And it is *you*, the spirit – with your will, energy, virtue, and purity – that I desire, not merely your delicate body. If you wished, you could come with a soft flight and nestle against my heart. But if seized against your will, you will elude my grasp like a scent – you will vanish before I can inhale your fragrance. Oh, please, come, Jane, come!\" As he said this, he released me from his hold and simply looked at me. That gaze was far harder to resist than the frantic force. However, only an idiot would have given in now. I had faced and defeated his fury; I had to escape his sorrow. I withdrew towards the door. \"You are leaving, Jane?\" \"I am leaving, sir.\" \"You are abandoning me?\" \"Yes.\" \"You will not come? You will not be my comfort, my rescuer? My deep love, my intense suffering, my desperate plea mean nothing to you?\" The pathos in his voice was beyond description! It was incredibly difficult to repeat firmly, \"I am going.\" \"Jane!\" \"Mr. Rochester!\" \"Then withdraw – I agree; but remember, you leave me here in agony. Go up to your own room; reflect on everything I have said, and, Jane, consider my suffering – think of me.\" He turned away and threw himself face down on the sofa. \"Oh, Jane! my hope – my love – my life!\" broke from his lips in anguish. Then came a deep, powerful sob. I had already reached the door, but, reader, I walked back – walked back with the same resolve as I had retreated. I knelt beside him, turned his face from the cushion towards me, kissed his cheek, and smoothed his hair with my hand. \"God bless you, my dear master!\" I said. \"May God keep you from harm and wrong – guide you, comfort you – reward you generously for your past kindness to me.\" \"Little Jane's love would have been my best reward,\" he answered; \"without it, my heart is broken. But Jane *will* give me her love; yes – nobly, generously.\" Blood rushed to his face; fire flashed from his eyes; he suddenly sprang upright. He held out his arms, but I evaded the embrace and immediately left the room. \"Farewell!\" cried my heart as I departed. Despair added, \"Farewell for ever!\" That night, I never expected to sleep, but slumber overcame me as soon as I lay in bed. My thoughts carried me back to scenes from childhood. I dreamt I lay in the red-room at Gateshead, that the night was dark, and my mind was filled with strange fears. The light that had caused me to faint long ago, reappearing in this vision, seemed to float up the wall and pause trembling in the center of the dark ceiling. I raised my head to look: the roof dissolved into high, dim clouds. The gleam was like the moon's light on vapors she is about to separate. I watched her come – watched with the most unusual anticipation, as though some message of destiny were to be written on her surface. She emerged as no moon had ever burst from clouds before: first, a hand penetrated the black folds and waved them away; then, not a moon, but a white human form shone in the blue sky, inclining a glorious brow towards the earth. It gazed and gazed at me. It spoke to my spirit; the tone was incredibly distant, yet so close it whispered in my heart – \"My daughter, flee temptation.\" \"Mother, I will.\"",
          "paraphrase_gpt-4.1-2025-04-14": "I did as he asked, and Mr. Rochester, seeing the expression on my face, realized it. He became as furious as possible and had to give in to his anger for a moment, regardless of the consequences. He strode across the room, grabbed my arm and waist, and looked at me with burning eyes. In that instant, I felt physically as weak as a piece of straw before a fiery furnace, but my mind remained clear, and I trusted that I would ultimately be safe. Fortunately, the soul often expresses itself honestly, even if unconsciously, through the eyes. I met his gaze, and, as I looked at his intense face, an involuntary sigh escaped me; his grip hurt, and I was nearly at the end of my strength.\n\n\"Never,\" he said, grinding his teeth, \"have I seen something so delicate yet so unconquerable. She feels like nothing in my hand!\" (He shook me as he said this.) \"I could bend or even break her physically, but what would it matter? That look in her eye—wild, determined, and proud—defies me. Even if I destroy her body, the spirit inside would escape before I could ever possess it. What I want is your spirit, Jane—your will, your strength, your goodness and innocence—not just your fragile body. If you wanted, you could willingly come to me and let me comfort you; forced, you would vanish like air before I could hold you. Oh, come to me, Jane!\"\n\nHe let go, but his look was even harder to withstand than his grasp. Still, I resisted; I had faced his anger, now I needed to avoid his sorrow. I withdrew towards the door.\n\n\"You're leaving, Jane?\" he asked.\n\"I am, sir,\" I replied.\n\"You'll go and not comfort me, not rescue me? Do my love and sorrow mean nothing to you?\"\n\nHis voice was full of such pain; it was so difficult to say again, \"I am going.\"\n\n\"Jane!\"\n\"Mr. Rochester!\"\n\"Then go,\" he said. \"But remember, you leave me in pain. Go to your room and think over what I have said. Think of my suffering.\"\n\nHe turned away and threw himself face-down on the sofa, crying out in anguish, \"Oh, Jane—my hope, my love, my life!\" Then he sobbed deeply.\n\nI had reached the door, but then I returned, just as determinedly. I knelt beside him, turned his face toward me, kissed his cheek, and gently stroked his hair.\n\n\"God bless you, my dear master,\" I said. \"May God keep you from harm, guide and comfort you, and reward you for your kindness to me.\"\n\nHe answered, \"Jane's love would have been my greatest reward; without it, I'm broken. But Jane will give me her love—generously, nobly.\"\n\nHe flushed and his eyes lit up; he stood up with arms outstretched, but I avoided his embrace and left the room immediately.\n\n\"Farewell!\" cried my heart as I left him. Sorrow added, \"Farewell forever!\"\n\nI expected not to sleep that night, but fell into slumber as soon as I lay down. In my dreams, I was a child again, lying in the red-room at Gateshead, full of strange fears in the dark. The same light that once frightened me appeared again, glowing on the ceiling. I looked up as the ceiling transformed into distant, misty clouds and the light looked like moonlight about to split the clouds. I watched with a peculiar sense of anticipation, as though some fate was about to be revealed. The light parted the darkness and, rather than a moon, a shining white human figure appeared, gazing down at me. Its presence spoke to me, both distant and near, whispering, \"My daughter, flee temptation.\"\n\nI answered, \"Mother, I will.\""

          "text_segment": "So I answered after I had waked from the trance-like dream. It was yet night, but July nights are short: soon after midnight, dawn comes. “It cannot be too early to commence the task I have to fulfil,” thought I. I rose: I was dressed; for I had taken off nothing but my shoes. I knew where to find in my drawers some linen, a locket, a ring. In seeking these articles, I encountered the beads of a pearl necklace Mr. Rochester had forced me to accept a few days ago. I left that; it was not mine: it was the visionary bride’s who had melted in air. The other articles I made up in a parcel; my purse, containing twenty shillings (it was all I had), I put in my pocket: I tied on my straw bonnet, pinned my shawl, took the parcel and my slippers, which I would not put on yet, and stole from my room.\n“Farewell, kind Mrs. Fairfax!” I whispered, as I glided past her door. “Farewell, my darling Adèle!” I said, as I glanced towards the nursery. No thought could be admitted of entering to embrace her. I had to deceive a fine ear: for aught I knew it might now be listening.\nI would have got past Mr. Rochester’s chamber without a pause; but my heart momentarily stopping its beat at that threshold, my foot was forced to stop also. No sleep was there: the inmate was walking restlessly from wall to wall; and again and again he sighed while I listened. There was a heaven—a temporary heaven—in this room for me, if I chose: I had but to go in and to say—\n“Mr. Rochester, I will love you and live with you through life till death,” and a fount of rapture would spring to my lips. I thought of this.\nThat kind master, who could not sleep now, was waiting with impatience for day. He would send for me in the morning; I should be gone. He would have me sought for: vainly. He would feel himself forsaken; his love rejected: he would suffer; perhaps grow desperate. I thought of this too. My hand moved towards the lock: I caught it back, and glided on.\nDrearily I wound my way downstairs: I knew what I had to do, and I did it mechanically. I sought the key of the side-door in the kitchen; I sought, too, a phial of oil and a feather; I oiled the key and the lock. I got some water, I got some bread: for perhaps I should have to walk far; and my strength, sorely shaken of late, must not break down. All this I did without one sound. I opened the door, passed out, shut it softly. Dim dawn glimmered in the yard. The great gates were closed and locked; but a wicket in one of them was only latched. Through that I departed: it, too, I shut; and now I was out of Thornfield.\nA mile off, beyond the fields, lay a road which stretched in the contrary direction to Millcote; a road I had never travelled, but often noticed, and wondered where it led: thither I bent my steps. No reflection was to be allowed now: not one glance was to be cast back; not even one forward. Not one thought was to be given either to the past or the future. The first was a page so heavenly sweet—so deadly sad—that to read one line of it would dissolve my courage and break down my energy. The last was an awful blank: something like the world when the deluge was gone by.\nI skirted fields, and hedges, and lanes till after sunrise. I believe it was a lovely summer morning: I know my shoes, which I had put on when I left the house, were soon wet with dew. But I looked neither to rising sun, nor smiling sky, nor wakening nature. He who is taken out to pass through a fair scene to the scaffold, thinks not of the flowers that smile on his road, but of the block and axe-edge; of the disseverment of bone and vein; of the grave gaping at the end: and I thought of drear flight and homeless wandering—and oh! with agony I thought of what I left. I could not help it. I thought of him now—in his room—watching the sunrise; hoping I should soon come to say I would stay with him and be his. I longed to be his; I panted to return: it was not too late; I could yet spare him the bitter pang of bereavement. As yet my flight, I was sure, was undiscovered. I could go back and be his comforter—his pride; his redeemer from misery, perhaps from ruin. Oh, that fear of his self-abandonment—far worse than my abandonment—how it goaded me! It was a barbed arrow-head in my breast; it tore me when I tried to extract it; it sickened me when remembrance thrust it farther in. Birds began singing in brake and copse: birds were faithful to their mates; birds were emblems of love. What was I? In the midst of my pain of heart and frantic effort of principle, I abhorred myself. I had no solace from self-approbation: none even from self-respect. I had injured—wounded—left my master. I was hateful in my own eyes. Still I could not turn, nor retrace one step. God must have led me on. As to my own will or conscience, impassioned grief had trampled one and stifled the other. I was weeping wildly as I walked along my solitary way: fast, fast I went like one delirious. A weakness, beginning inwardly, extending to the limbs, seized me, and I fell: I lay on the ground some minutes, pressing my face to the wet turf. I had some fear—or hope—that here I should die: but I was soon up; crawling forwards on my hands and knees, and then again raised to my feet—as eager and as determined as ever to reach the road.\nWhen I got there, I was forced to sit to rest me under the hedge; and while I sat, I heard wheels, and saw a coach come on. I stood up and lifted my hand; it stopped. I asked where it was going: the driver named a place a long way off, and where I was sure Mr. Rochester had no connections. I asked for what sum he would take me there; he said thirty shillings; I answered I had but twenty; well, he would try to make it do. He further gave me leave to get into the inside, as the vehicle was empty: I entered, was shut in, and it rolled on its way.\nGentle reader, may you never feel what I then felt! May your eyes never shed such stormy, scalding, heart-wrung tears as poured from mine. May you never appeal to Heaven in prayers so hopeless and so agonised as in that hour left my lips; for never may you, like me, dread to be the instrument of evil to what you wholly love.",
          "paraphrase_gemini-2.5-flash-preview-04-17": "Awakening from a daze, I responded. It was still nighttime, but July nights are short, with dawn breaking soon after midnight. I told myself it was not too early to begin the task I had to complete. I got up, already dressed except for my shoes. I knew where to find some linen, a locket, and a ring in my drawers. While searching for these, my hand touched the pearl necklace Mr. Rochester had insisted I take a few days earlier. I left it; it wasn't mine, but belonged to the imaginary bride who had vanished. I gathered the other items into a small bundle. My purse, containing twenty shillings—all the money I had—went into my pocket. I tied on my straw bonnet, pinned my shawl, took the bundle and my slippers (which I wouldn't put on yet), and quietly slipped out of my room. \"Goodbye, kind Mrs. Fairfax!\" I whispered as I crept past her door. \"Goodbye, my dear Adèle!\" I said as I glanced towards the nursery, knowing I couldn't possibly go in to hug her. I had to be silent; someone with a keen ear might be listening. I intended to pass Mr. Rochester's room without stopping, but my heart seemed to stop at the threshold, forcing my feet to halt as well. He wasn't sleeping; I heard him pacing restlessly back and forth inside, sighing repeatedly as I listened. I knew that if I chose, a temporary heaven could be mine in that room; I just had to enter and say, \"Mr. Rochester, I will love you and live with you until death.\" Such words would bring me immediate joy. I considered this. That kind master, currently sleepless, was waiting anxiously for morning. He would send for me, only to find me gone. He would search in vain, feel abandoned, his love rejected; he would suffer and perhaps become desperate. I thought of this too. My hand moved towards the doorknob, but I pulled it back and continued on. With a heavy heart, I went downstairs, performing my actions automatically, knowing what I had to do. I found the key to the side door in the kitchen, along with a small container of oil and a feather; I oiled the key and the lock. I got some water and bread, anticipating a long journey that would require my strength, which had been severely tested recently. I did all this silently. I opened the door, stepped outside, and closed it softly. Dim dawn light filtered into the yard. The large gates were shut and locked, but a smaller gate within one of them was only latched. I left through this, closed it behind me, and was now outside Thornfield. A mile away, across the fields, lay a road leading in the opposite direction from Millcote. It was a road I had never traveled but had often seen, wondering where it led; this is where I headed. I was determined not to look back or forward, not to dwell on the past or the future. The past was a memory so wonderfully sweet yet so tragically sad that recalling even a single detail would shatter my courage and willpower. The future was a terrifying emptiness, like the world after a great flood. I walked alongside fields, hedges, and lanes until after sunrise. I believe it was a beautiful summer morning, though my shoes, which I put on after leaving the house, were soon soaked with dew. But I paid no attention to the rising sun, the pleasant sky, or the awakening nature. Like someone led to the scaffold through a lovely scene, I could only think of the execution block, the axe, the severing of bone and vein, and the waiting grave. Similarly, I thought only of desperate escape and homeless wandering—and oh, with agony, I thought of what I was leaving behind. I couldn't help it. I thought of him now, in his room, watching the sunrise, hoping I would soon come and tell him I would stay and be his. I longed to be his, to return; it wasn't too late. I could still spare him the cruel pain of loss. I was sure my departure was still undiscovered. I could go back and be his comfort, his pride, perhaps even save him from misery or ruin. Oh, the fear of his potential self-destruction—far worse than my own abandonment—how it tormented me! It was like a barbed arrowhead in my chest, tearing at me when I tried to remove it, sickening me when memory pushed it deeper. Birds began singing in the bushes and woods; birds were faithful to their partners, symbols of love. What was I? In the midst of my heartache and desperate adherence to principle, I despised myself. I found no comfort in self-approval, not even in self-respect. I had wronged, wounded, and left my master. I was hateful in my own eyes. Yet, I could not turn back or retrace a single step. God must have been guiding me. My own will and conscience were crushed and silenced by overwhelming grief. I wept uncontrollably as I walked my solitary path, moving rapidly, like someone delirious. A weakness, starting within and spreading to my limbs, seized me, and I fell. I lay on the ground for several minutes, pressing my face into the wet grass. I had a momentary fear—or perhaps hope—that I might die there. But I soon got up, first crawling on my hands and knees, then rising to my feet, as determined as ever to reach the road. When I got there, I had to sit and rest under the hedge. While I rested, I heard wheels and saw a coach approaching. I stood up and raised my hand; it stopped. I asked where it was going; the driver named a place far away, one I was certain Mr. Rochester had no connection to. I asked how much he would charge to take me there; he said thirty shillings. I replied that I only had twenty, and he agreed to make it work. He also allowed me to get inside, as the coach was empty. I entered, the door was closed, and the carriage began its journey. Kind reader, may you never experience what I felt then! May your eyes never shed such fierce, burning, painful tears as mine poured. May you never appeal to Heaven with prayers as hopeless and agonizing as those that left my lips in that hour, for may you never, like me, fear being the cause of harm to the person you love completely.",

Thinking it was not too soon to begin the task ahead, I got up; I was already dressed except for my shoes, which I had removed. I gathered some linen, a locket, and a ring from my drawer. While searching, I found the pearls Mr. Rochester had insisted I accept a few days before; I left them behind, feeling they belonged not to me, but to the imaginary bride who no longer existed. I packed the items into a bundle, placed my purse with my only twenty shillings in my pocket, put on my bonnet and shawl, took the parcel and my slippers, and quietly left my room.\n\nAs I passed Mrs. Fairfax’s door, I whispered my goodbye to her, and as I looked toward the nursery, I bid farewell to little Adèle; I couldn’t risk entering to embrace her, afraid someone might hear me. Passing by Mr. Rochester’s room, I meant to walk on, but stopped involuntarily at his door, listening to his restless pacing and repeated sighs. In that room was the promise of happiness if I only dared enter and promise to stay with him forever. I thought of the joy I could have, but also how he would feel upon discovering my absence—abandoned and rejected, perhaps driven to despair. My hand even reached for his door, but I restrained myself and moved on.\n\nDescending the stairs, I mechanically proceeded with my plan, finding the side-door key in the kitchen and collecting a small bottle of oil and a feather to quietly open the lock. I also took some bread and water, fearing I might have to walk far and my weakened strength might fail me. I did all this silently, slipped outside, and softly closed the door. The gates were shut, but a small latched door allowed my exit. I closed it behind me and left Thornfield.\n\nI headed toward a road beyond the fields, one I’d never traveled but often wondered about, avoiding any thoughts of past or future, as either would sap my resolve. The past was full of sweet memories now too painful to recall, and the future was a terrifying emptiness. I walked through fields and along hedges and lanes as the sun rose; although it was a beautiful morning and my shoes grew wet with dew, I noticed nothing, consumed as I was by the pain of leaving what I loved most. The analogy came to me of a condemned person led to execution, only able to think of suffering and death, not the beauty around them. I thought constantly of Mr. Rochester, imagining him waiting for me and longing for me to return, feeling the pain of possibly causing his despair. Still, I couldn’t turn back, no matter how much I desired to, feeling driven by a will greater than my own. Overwhelmed with grief, I wept openly, walking quickly and almost without control, until exhaustion forced me to fall to the ground. After regaining some strength, I crawled and then stood, determined to reach the road.\n\nWhen I finally arrived at the road, I rested by a hedge. Hearing a carriage, I signaled for it to stop, and after asking the fare, found I had only enough money for the driver to accept to try to take me as far as my funds allowed. I boarded alone, and we departed.\n\nDear reader, I hope you never endure what I did then or feel anguish as deep or hopeless. May you never pray in such agony or fear causing pain to someone you love as deeply as I did."

          "text_segment": "Two days are passed. It is a summer evening; the coachman has set me down at a place called Whitcross; he could take me no farther for the sum I had given, and I was not possessed of another shilling in the world. The coach is a mile off by this time; I am alone. At this moment I discover that I forgot to take my parcel out of the pocket of the coach, where I had placed it for safety; there it remains, there it must remain; and now, I am absolutely destitute.\nWhitcross is no town, nor even a hamlet; it is but a stone pillar set up where four roads meet: whitewashed, I suppose, to be more obvious at a distance and in darkness. Four arms spring from its summit: the nearest town to which these point is, according to the inscription, distant ten miles; the farthest, above twenty. From the well-known names of these towns I learn in what county I have lighted; a north-midland shire, dusk with moorland, ridged with mountain: this I see. There are great moors behind and on each hand of me; there are waves of mountains far beyond that deep valley at my feet. The population here must be thin, and I see no passengers on these roads: they stretch out east, west, north, and south—white, broad, lonely; they are all cut in the moor, and the heather grows deep and wild to their very verge. Yet a chance traveller might pass by; and I wish no eye to see me now: strangers would wonder what I am doing, lingering here at the sign-post, evidently objectless and lost. I might be questioned: I could give no answer but what would sound incredible and excite suspicion. Not a tie holds me to human society at this moment—not a charm or hope calls me where my fellow-creatures are—none that saw me would have a kind thought or a good wish for me. I have no relative but the universal mother, Nature: I will seek her breast and ask repose.\nI struck straight into the heath; I held on to a hollow I saw deeply furrowing the brown moorside; I waded knee-deep in its dark growth; I turned with its turnings, and finding a moss-blackened granite crag in a hidden angle, I sat down under it. High banks of moor were about me; the crag protected my head: the sky was over that.",

She soon discovered that she had forgotten to retrieve her parcel of belongings from the coach pocket where she had placed it for safety. Now left alone and a mile from the departing coach, she was completely broke and without possessions. Whitcross wasn't a village or town, but just a white stone post marking where four roads met, likely painted to be easily seen. It had arms indicating the direction and distance to various towns, the closest ten miles away, the farthest over twenty. From the names of these towns, she realized she was in a north-midland county, characterized by its dark moors and mountainous ridges, which she could see around her – vast moors nearby and waves of mountains beyond a deep valley. The area seemed sparsely populated, with no other travelers on the wide, empty roads that cut through the wild moorland where the heather grew thick to the edges. Hoping to avoid any chance encounters, as her presence there, looking lost and without purpose, would arouse curiosity and she had no believable explanation that wouldn't cause suspicion, she felt utterly disconnected from human society. Without any ties or hope calling her towards others, she decided to seek comfort in nature, her 'universal mother'. She walked directly into the heath, following a deep groove she saw on the brown moor side. Wading through the dense growth up to her knees, she followed the hollow's turns until she found a moss-covered granite rock in a secluded corner, where she sat down. High moorland banks surrounded her, the rock shielded her head, and the sky was visible above.",

It's a warm evening in summer, and the coachman has dropped me off at a place named Whitcross; he couldn't drive me any further for the fare I'd paid, and I don't have a single other coin to my name. By now, the coach is already a mile away and I'm completely alone. At this point, I realize I've forgotten to retrieve my bundle from the seat pocket in the coach where I'd stored it for safekeeping; it's still there and I have no way to get it back—making me entirely penniless.\n\nWhitcross isn't a village or even a small settlement; it's simply a stone post at a crossroads, covered in white paint to make it stand out at a distance, especially at night. At its top, four signposts point to different directions: the nearest town is, by the lettering, ten miles away; the furthest is over twenty. From the familiar place names, I understand which county I've arrived in—a northern, central county with moors and mountain ridges like those around me. Stretching behind, to each side, are wide moorlands; beyond the valley at my feet, I can see layers of mountains. Not many people must live nearby, as I don't see anyone traveling these roads, which go off to the east, west, north, and south—broad, pale, and deserted, carved through the wild moorland with thick heather growing right up to their edges. Even though a random traveler might appear, I sincerely hope that nobody sees me now; a stranger would likely wonder why I'm loitering by the signpost, looking aimless and lost. If confronted, I could only give answers that would seem unbelievable and raise suspicion. At this moment, I have no connection left to society—not a single tie, hope, or call draws me towards other people; no one who saw me would wish me well. My only connection now is with Mother Nature herself: I will turn to her for comfort and rest.\n\nSo, I began walking straight into the heath, following a deep trench I saw cutting into the brown slope of the moor. I pushed through knee-high rough vegetation, twisting along with the hollow until I found a moss-covered rock in a secluded spot. There, I sat down, sheltered by high banks of moorland and the stone behind me, with the open sky above."

If a gust of wind swept the waste, I looked up, fearing it was the rush of a bull; if a plover whistled, I imagined it a man. Finding my apprehensions unfounded, however, and calmed by the deep silence that reigned as evening declined at nightfall, I took confidence. As yet I had not thought; I had only listened, watched, dreaded; now I regained the faculty of reflection.\nWhat was I to do? Where to go? Oh, intolerable questions, when I could do nothing and go nowhere!—when a long way must yet be measured by my weary, trembling limbs before I could reach human habitation—when cold charity must be entreated before I could get a lodging: reluctant sympathy importuned, almost certain repulse incurred, before my tale could be listened to, or one of my wants relieved!\nI touched the heath: it was dry, and yet warm with the heat of the summer day. I looked at the sky; it was pure: a kindly star twinkled just above the chasm ridge. The dew fell, but with propitious softness; no breeze whispered. Nature seemed to me benign and good; I thought she loved me, outcast as I was; and I, who from man could anticipate only mistrust, rejection, insult, clung to her with filial fondness. To-night, at least, I would be her guest, as I was her child: my mother would lodge me without money and without price. I had one morsel of bread yet: the remnant of a roll I had bought in a town we passed through at noon with a stray penny—my last coin. I saw ripe bilberries gleaming here and there, like jet beads in the heath: I gathered a handful and ate them with the bread. My hunger, sharp before, was, if not satisfied, appeased by this hermit’s meal. I said my evening prayers at its conclusion, and then chose my couch.\nBeside the crag the heath was very deep: when I lay down my feet were buried in it; rising high on each side, it left only a narrow space for the night-air to invade. I folded my shawl double, and spread it over me for a coverlet; a low, mossy swell was my pillow. Thus lodged, I was not, at least at the commencement of the night, cold.\nMy rest might have been blissful enough, only a sad heart broke it. It plained of its gaping wounds, its inward bleeding, its riven chords. It trembled for Mr. Rochester and his doom; it bemoaned him with bitter pity; it demanded him with ceaseless longing; and, impotent as a bird with both wings broken, it still quivered its shattered pinions in vain attempts to seek him.\nWorn out with this torture of thought, I rose to my knees. Night was come, and her planets were risen: a safe, still night: too serene for the companionship of fear. We know that God is everywhere; but certainly we feel His presence most when His works are on the grandest scale spread before us; and it is in the unclouded night-sky, where His worlds wheel their silent course, that we read clearest His infinitude, His omnipotence, His omnipresence. I had risen to my knees to pray for Mr. Rochester. Looking up, I, with tear-dimmed eyes, saw the mighty Milky-way. Remembering what it was—what countless systems there swept space like a soft trace of light—I felt the might and strength of God. Sure was I of His efficiency to save what He had made: convinced I grew that neither earth should perish, nor one of the souls it treasured. I turned my prayer to thanksgiving: the Source of Life was also the Saviour of spirits. Mr. Rochester was safe: he was God’s, and by God would he be guarded.

A vague anxiety persisted that wild animals might be nearby, or that I could be discovered by a hunter or poacher. If a gust of wind swept across the desolate land, I'd look up, fearing the rush of a bull, and if I heard a plover whistle, I'd mistake it for a person. However, finding my fears were groundless and feeling calmed by the deep silence that settled as evening gave way to night, I began to feel more secure. Until then, I hadn't truly thought, only reacted\ntaking in sounds, watching, and fearing. Now, my ability to reflect returned. What should I do? Where could I go? These were unbearable questions given my inability to act or travel far\nas my exhausted, trembling legs still had a great distance to cover to reach any human dwelling. Once there, I would have to beg for cold charity just to find shelter, pleading for reluctant sympathy, and almost certainly facing rejection before anyone would listen to my story or alleviate my needs. I touched the heath; it was dry and still warm from the summer day's heat. I looked up at the sky; it was clear, with a friendly star twinkling just above the ridge of the chasm. The dew fell gently and favorably, and there was no breeze. Nature seemed kind and benevolent to me; I felt she loved me despite my status as an outcast. And I, who could only expect mistrust, rejection, and insult from people, clung to her with a child's affection. At least tonight, I would be her guest, just as I was her child; my mother, Nature, would shelter me without asking for payment. I still had one small piece of bread left, the remainder of a roll I'd bought with a stray penny\nmy last coin\nin a town we passed through at midday. I noticed ripe bilberries gleaming in the heath here and there, like black beads. I gathered a handful and ate them with the bread. My hunger, which had been sharp, was, if not fully satisfied, at least eased by this simple, solitary meal. I said my evening prayers after eating, and then selected my resting place. Beside the rock, the heath was very thick. When I lay down, my feet were buried in it, and it rose high on either side, leaving only a narrow opening for the night air. I folded my shawl in half and spread it over myself as a blanket. A low, mossy mound served as my pillow. Arranged like this, I was not cold, at least at the start of the night. My rest might have been quite peaceful, but a sorrowful heart disturbed it. It lamented its deep wounds, its inner bleeding, its broken ties. It trembled for Mr. Rochester and his fate. It mourned him with bitter pity and demanded him with unending yearning. Powerless, like a bird with both wings shattered, it still quivered its broken feathers in futile attempts to reach him. Exhausted by this mental torment, I got up onto my knees. Night had fully arrived, and its planets had risen\na safe, quiet night, too tranquil to be accompanied by fear. We know God is everywhere, but surely we feel His presence most strongly when His creations are displayed before us on the grandest scale. It is in the clear night sky, where His worlds silently orbit, that we most clearly perceive His boundless nature, His absolute power, and His omnipresence. I had risen to my knees to pray for Mr. Rochester. Looking up with eyes blurred by tears, I saw the magnificent Milky Way. Remembering what it was\nwhat countless systems swept through space like a faint streak of light\nI felt the power and strength of God. I was sure of His ability to save what He had created; I became convinced that neither the earth nor any of the souls it holds would perish. I changed my prayer to thanksgiving. The Source of Life was also the Savior of spirits. Mr. Rochester was safe; he belonged to God and would be protected by God. I settled back into the embrace of the hill, and before long, sleep allowed me to forget my sorrow.",

Any sudden gust of wind made me think it could be a bull charging, and the call of a bird could seem like a person approaching. But as nothing happened and the stillness of the evening set in, I finally started to feel more secure. Up to this point, I had only been nervous and alert, but now, as I grew calmer, I began to think about my situation. What should I do next? Where could I go? These questions felt unbearable when I had no options and my body was exhausted from traveling so far, knowing I would have to walk even longer before reaching any home; and even then, I would have to rely on charity, possibly face rejection, and beg for help before anyone would listen or assist me. I touched the ground and found it still warm from the day's sun. The sky above was clear, with a friendly star shining. Dew began to fall, but it was gentle; everything was peaceful, and I felt that nature was kind to me despite my isolation. I felt closer to nature than to people, who I expected would only doubt or reject me. Tonight, at least, I would stay in nature's care, sheltered and cared for as if by a mother. I still had a small piece of bread left, the remainder of a roll I had bought with my last coin earlier that day. I also saw some ripe bilberries and picked them to eat along with my bread. This simple meal eased my hunger somewhat. After praying, I prepared my bed. The heather beside a rock was thick and deep, rising around me so that only a little air could reach me as I lay down, using my shawl for warmth and a mossy mound as a pillow. At least at first, I was not cold. My sleep, however, was disturbed by sadness. My heart ached for Mr. Rochester, worrying about his fate, pitying and longing for him, and yearning to be with him despite my helplessness. Eventually, troubled by these thoughts, I rose to pray for him. The night was peaceful and starry, inspiring a sense of God's presence and power as I looked up at the stars, especially the Milky Way. Remembering the vastness of the universe, I felt reassured of God's ability to protect His creations, convinced that neither the world nor any soul would be lost. My prayers turned into thanks: God, who gives life, also saves spirits. I felt certain Mr. Rochester was safe in God's hands. Feeling comforted, I lay down again and soon fell asleep, forgetting my sorrows for a while."

Long after the little birds had left their nests; long after bees had come in the sweet prime of day to gather the heath honey before the dew was dried—when the long morning shadows were curtailed, and the sun filled earth and sky—I got up, and I looked round me.\nWhat a still, hot, perfect day! What a golden desert this spreading moor! Everywhere sunshine. I wished I could live in it and on it. I saw a lizard run over the crag; I saw a bee busy among the sweet bilberries. I would fain at the moment have become bee or lizard, that I might have found fitting nutriment, permanent shelter here. But I was a human being, and had a human being’s wants: I must not linger where there was nothing to supply them. I rose; I looked back at the bed I had left. Hopeless of the future, I wished but this—that my Maker had that night thought good to require my soul of me while I slept; and that this weary frame, absolved by death from further conflict with fate, had now but to decay quietly, and mingle in peace with the soil of this wilderness. Life, however, was yet in my possession, with all its requirements, and pains, and responsibilities. The burden must be carried; the want provided for; the suffering endured; the responsibility fulfilled. I set out.\nWhitcross regained, I followed a road which led from the sun, now fervent and high. By no other circumstance had I will to decide my choice. I walked a long time, and when I thought I had nearly done enough, and might conscientiously yield to the fatigue that almost overpowered me—might relax this forced action, and, sitting down on a stone I saw near, submit resistlessly to the apathy that clogged heart and limb—I heard a bell chime—a church bell.\nI turned in the direction of the sound, and there, amongst the romantic hills, whose changes and aspect I had ceased to note an hour ago, I saw a hamlet and a spire. All the valley at my right hand was full of pasture-fields, and cornfields, and wood; and a glittering stream ran zig-zag through the varied shades of green, the mellowing grain, the sombre woodland, the clear and sunny lea. Recalled by the rumbling of wheels to the road before me, I saw a heavily-laden waggon labouring up the hill, and not far beyond were two cows and their drover. Human life and human labour were near. I must struggle on: strive to live and bend to toil like the rest.",
          "paraphrase_gemini-2.5-flash-preview-04-17": "However, the next day brought me face to face with severe need. It was long after the small birds were up and out of their nests, and long after the bees had arrived early in the day to collect honey from the heather before the morning dew had evaporated. The sun was high, the long morning shadows had shortened, and the sun's presence filled the landscape. I finally got up and surveyed my surroundings. What a calm, warm, and perfect day it was! This vast moorland seemed like a golden, sun-drenched desert. Sunshine was everywhere. I wished I could reside in this place and sustain myself from it. I noticed a lizard scurry over a rock and a bee busy among the sweet bilberries. At that moment, I would gladly have traded places with the bee or the lizard so that I could easily find sustenance and lasting refuge here. But I was human, with human necessities, and I couldn't remain where nothing could fulfill them. I stood up and glanced back at the spot where I had rested. Feeling hopeless about the future, I could only wish that my Creator had chosen to take my soul during the night as I slept, and that this tired body, freed by death from further conflict with destiny, could simply decompose peacefully and blend into the soil of this wild place. Yet, I still possessed life, with all its demands, hardships, and duties. The weight of existence had to be borne, the need had to be addressed, the suffering had to be endured, and the responsibilities had to be met. I began my journey. Upon reaching Whitcross again, I took a road that led away from the sun, which was now intensely hot and high. My choice of direction was dictated by nothing else. I walked for a considerable time, and just as I felt I had endured enough and could reasonably give in to the exhaustion that was nearly overwhelming me—to cease this forced movement and, sitting on a nearby stone, passively surrender to the numbness that was slowing my heart and limbs—I heard a church bell chime. I turned towards the sound and there, nestled amongst the picturesque hills whose changing appearance I had stopped noticing an hour before, I saw a small village and a church spire. The entire valley to my right was covered in pastures, grain fields, and woodlands; a sparkling stream meandered through the varied shades of green fields, the ripening crops, the dark woods, and the bright, sunny meadows. The sound of rumbling wheels on the road ahead brought my attention back, and I saw a heavily loaded wagon struggling up the hill, followed not far behind by two cows and their handler. Human activity and human labor were nearby. I had to keep going; I had to strive to live and accept the need to work, just like everyone else.",
          "paraphrase_gpt-4.1-2025-04-14": "But the following day, I was confronted with hunger and deprivation, stark and real. After the birds had already left their nests and the bees had begun their morning work collecting nectar, when the sun had risen high and illuminated everything, I finally got up and surveyed my lonely surroundings. The day was tranquil, hot, and beautifully clear; the moor stretched before me like a vast, golden expanse bathed in sunlight. I longed to live off the land, to feel at home in that radiant space. As I watched a lizard scurry over the rocks and a bee gathering from the berry bushes, I wished I could become one of those creatures, able to find sustenance and shelter right there. However, as a human, I had needs that could not be met on the moor. I could not stay where nothing could sustain me. I rose and looked back at where I had slept, wishing, in my hopelessness, that I had died quietly in my sleep so that my tired body could be at rest and merge with the earth in peace. But I was still alive, with all life's demands, pains, and duties. I had to bear my burdens, fulfill my needs, endure suffering, and accept my responsibilities. So I began walking again.\n\nWhen I returned to Whitcross, I simply took a road away from the hot, glaring sun, letting nothing else guide my choice. I walked for a long time. Just as exhaustion overcame me and I considered giving in, sitting down on a nearby stone and surrendering to numbness, I heard a church bell ringing. Turning toward the sound, I saw, among the picturesque hills, a small village with a church spire. Below me lay a valley full of meadows, fields of crops, woods, and a shining stream winding through them all. Drawn by the noise of wheels on the road, I noticed a heavy wagon climbing the hill and, further along, two cows with their herder. I realized that people and their labor were nearby—I had to keep going, determined to live and work as others did."

          "text_segment": "About two o’clock P.M. I entered the village. At the bottom of its one street there was a little shop with some cakes of bread in the window. I coveted a cake of bread. With that refreshment I could perhaps regain a degree of energy: without it, it would be difficult to proceed. The wish to have some strength and some vigour returned to me as soon as I was amongst my fellow-beings. I felt it would be degrading to faint with hunger on the causeway of a hamlet. Had I nothing about me I could offer in exchange for one of these rolls? I considered. I had a small silk handkerchief tied round my throat; I had my gloves. I could hardly tell how men and women in extremities of destitution proceeded. I did not know whether either of these articles would be accepted: probably they would not; but I must try.\nI entered the shop: a woman was there. Seeing a respectably-dressed person, a lady as she supposed, she came forward with civility. How could she serve me? I was seized with shame: my tongue would not utter the request I had prepared. I dared not offer her the half-worn gloves, the creased handkerchief: besides, I felt it would be absurd. I only begged permission to sit down a moment, as I was tired. Disappointed in the expectation of a customer, she coolly acceded to my request. She pointed to a seat; I sank into it. I felt sorely urged to weep; but conscious how unseasonable such a manifestation would be, I restrained it. Soon I asked her “if there were any dressmaker or plain-workwoman in the village?”\n“Yes; two or three. Quite as many as there was employment for.”\nI reflected. I was driven to the point now. I was brought face to face with Necessity. I stood in the position of one without a resource, without a friend, without a coin. I must do something. What? I must apply somewhere. Where?\n“Did she know of any place in the neighbourhood where a servant was wanted?”\n“Nay; she couldn’t say.”\n“What was the chief trade in this place? What did most of the people do?”\n“Some were farm labourers; a good deal worked at Mr. Oliver’s needle-factory, and at the foundry.”\n“Did Mr. Oliver employ women?”\n“Nay; it was men’s work.”\n“And what do the women do?”\n“I knawn’t,” was the answer. “Some does one thing, and some another. Poor folk mun get on as they can.”\nShe seemed to be tired of my questions: and, indeed, what claim had I to importune her? A neighbour or two came in; my chair was evidently wanted. I took leave.\nI passed up the street, looking as I went at all the houses to the right hand and to the left; but I could discover no pretext, nor see an inducement to enter any. I rambled round the hamlet, going sometimes to a little distance and returning again, for an hour or more. Much exhausted, and suffering greatly now for want of food, I turned aside into a lane and sat down under the hedge. Ere many minutes had elapsed, I was again on my feet, however, and again searching something—a resource, or at least an informant. A pretty little house stood at the top of the lane, with a garden before it, exquisitely neat and brilliantly blooming. I stopped at it. What business had I to approach the white door or touch the glittering knocker? In what way could it possibly be the interest of the inhabitants of that dwelling to serve me? Yet I drew near and knocked. A mild-looking, cleanly-attired young woman opened the door. In such a voice as might be expected from a hopeless heart and fainting frame—a voice wretchedly low and faltering—I asked if a servant was wanted here?\n“No,” said she; “we do not keep a servant.”\n“Can you tell me where I could get employment of any kind?” I continued. “I am a stranger, without acquaintance in this place. I want some work: no matter what.”\nBut it was not her business to think for me, or to seek a place for me: besides, in her eyes, how doubtful must have appeared my character, position, tale. She shook her head, she “was sorry she could give me no information,” and the white door closed, quite gently and civilly: but it shut me out. If she had held it open a little longer, I believe I should have begged a piece of bread; for I was now brought low.\nI could not bear to return to the sordid village, where, besides, no prospect of aid was visible. I should have longed rather to deviate to a wood I saw not far off, which appeared in its thick shade to offer inviting shelter; but I was so sick, so weak, so gnawed with nature’s cravings, instinct kept me roaming round abodes where there was a chance of food. Solitude would be no solitude—rest no rest—while the vulture, hunger, thus sank beak and talons in my side.\nI drew near houses; I left them, and came back again, and again I wandered away: always repelled by the consciousness of having no claim to ask—no right to expect interest in my isolated lot. Meantime, the afternoon advanced, while I thus wandered about like a lost and starving dog. In crossing a field, I saw the church spire before me: I hastened towards it. Near the churchyard, and in the middle of a garden, stood a well-built though small house, which I had no doubt was the parsonage. I remembered that strangers who arrive at a place where they have no friends, and who want employment, sometimes apply to the clergyman for introduction and aid. It is the clergyman’s function to help—at least with advice—those who wished to help themselves. I seemed to have something like a right to seek counsel here. Renewing then my courage, and gathering my feeble remains of strength, I pushed on. I reached the house, and knocked at the kitchen-door. An old woman opened: I asked was this the parsonage?\n“Yes.”\n“Was the clergyman in?”\n“No.”\n“Would he be in soon?”\n“No, he was gone from home.”\n“To a distance?”\n“Not so far—happen three mile. He had been called away by the sudden death of his father: he was at Marsh End now, and would very likely stay there a fortnight longer.”\n“Was there any lady of the house?”\n“Nay, there was naught but her, and she was housekeeper;” and of her, reader, I could not bear to ask the relief for want of which I was sinking; I could not yet beg; and again I crawled away.\nOnce more I took off my handkerchief—once more I thought of the cakes of bread in the little shop. Oh, for but a crust! for but one mouthful to allay the pang of famine! Instinctively I turned my face again to the village; I found the shop again, and I went in; and though others were there besides the woman I ventured the request—“Would she give me a roll for this handkerchief?”\nShe looked at me with evident suspicion: “Nay, she never sold stuff i’ that way.”\nAlmost desperate, I asked for half a cake; she again refused. “How could she tell where I had got the handkerchief?” she said.\n“Would she take my gloves?”\n“No! what could she do with them?”\nReader, it is not pleasant to dwell on these details. Some say there is enjoyment in looking back to painful experience past; but at this day I can scarcely bear to review the times to which I allude: the moral degradation, blent with the physical suffering, form too distressing a recollection ever to be willingly dwelt on. I blamed none of those who repulsed me. I felt it was what was to be expected, and what could not be helped: an ordinary beggar is frequently an object of suspicion; a well-dressed beggar inevitably so. To be sure, what I begged was employment; but whose business was it to provide me with employment? Not, certainly, that of persons who saw me then for the first time, and who knew nothing about my character. And as to the woman who would not take my handkerchief in exchange for her bread, why, she was right, if the offer appeared to her sinister or the exchange unprofitable. Let me condense now. I am sick of the subject.",
          "paraphrase_gemini-2.5-flash-preview-04-17": "Around 2:00 PM, I arrived in the village. At the start of its single street, there was a small shop displaying some loaves of bread in the window. I desperately wanted one, believing it could restore some energy and make it possible to continue my journey. Being among people again reignited my desire for strength and vitality, and I felt it would be humiliating to collapse from hunger on the village path. I wondered if I had anything I could trade for a roll. I considered the small silk scarf tied around my neck and my gloves. I had no idea how completely destitute people typically managed, nor if these items would be accepted (likely not, but I felt I had to try). I went into the shop, where a woman was present. Seeing someone she assumed was a respectable lady, she approached me politely, asking how she could help. Shame overwhelmed me; I couldn't voice my planned request. Offering the worn gloves or crumpled scarf felt absurd, so I simply asked if I could sit down for a moment, explaining I was tired. Disappointed that I wasn't a customer, she coolly agreed and pointed to a seat, into which I sank. I was on the verge of tears but consciously held them back, knowing it was the wrong time. Soon, I asked her if there were any seamstresses or women who did plain sewing work in the village. She replied yes, saying there were two or three, which was sufficient for the available work. I thought about my situation. I was truly at rock bottom, facing stark necessity. I had no resources, no friends, and no money. I had to act, but where could I turn? I asked if she knew of any place nearby that needed a servant. She said she couldn't say. I then asked about the main occupations in the village and what most people did. She explained some were farm labourers, and many worked at Mr. Oliver's needle factory and the foundry. I asked if Mr. Oliver employed women, but she said it was men's work. 'And what do the women do?' I asked. 'I don't know,' she answered. 'Some do one thing, some another. Poor people just have to get by as they can.' She seemed tired of my questions, and I acknowledged I had no right to bother her. As neighbours entered and my chair was needed, I left. I walked up the street, scanning all the houses but finding no reason or opportunity to enter any. I wandered around the hamlet for over an hour, sometimes leaving and then returning. Greatly exhausted and now suffering intensely from hunger, I turned into a lane and sat under a hedge. However, after only a few minutes, I was back on my feet, compelled to search for a solution or at least someone who could help. At the end of the lane stood a lovely small house with a remarkably neat and vibrant garden. I stopped there. What justification did I have to approach the white door or touch the shining knocker? How could the residents possibly benefit from helping me? Yet, I approached and knocked. A gentle-looking young woman, neatly dressed, opened the door. With a voice that mirrored my despair and physical weakness—terribly quiet and trembling—I asked if they needed a servant. 'No,' she replied, 'we don't employ a servant.' 'Could you tell me where I might find any type of work?' I pressed on. 'I am a stranger here with no contacts. I need work, any work.' But it wasn't her responsibility to think for me or find me a job. Furthermore, my appearance, circumstances, and story must have seemed questionable to her. She shook her head, expressed regret that she couldn't assist me, and the white door closed, gently and politely, but it left me outside. I believe if she had left it open a moment longer, I would have begged for a piece of bread, as I was now truly desperate. I couldn't face returning to the grim village, especially since there was no visible hope of help there. I was tempted to go into a nearby wood that looked invitingly shaded, but I was too weak, too ill, and too consumed by hunger. Instinct kept me near houses where there was a chance of finding food. Solitude would offer no peace, nor rest any comfort, while the agony of hunger gnawed at me. I approached houses, left them, returned, and wandered away again, always held back by the feeling that I had no right to ask or expect anyone to care about my isolated plight. Meanwhile, the afternoon wore on as I roamed like a lost, starving animal. Crossing a field, I saw the church spire and headed towards it. Near the churchyard, in the center of a garden, stood a well-built but small house, which I assumed was the parsonage. I recalled that strangers needing work and lacking friends sometimes seek advice and assistance from the local clergyman. It's typically the clergyman's role to help, at least with guidance, those trying to help themselves. I felt I had some justification for seeking counsel here. Renewing my courage and gathering my remaining strength, I pressed on. I reached the house and knocked at the kitchen door. An old woman opened it. I asked if this was the parsonage. 'Yes.' 'Is the clergyman in?' 'No.' 'Will he be back soon?' 'No, he's away from home.' 'Far away?' 'Not too far—perhaps three miles. He was called away because of his father's sudden death; he is at Marsh End now and will likely stay for another two weeks.' 'Is there a lady of the house?' 'No, there's only me, and I'm the housekeeper.' Reader, I couldn't bring myself to ask her for the relief I desperately needed; I couldn't beg yet. So, I crept away once more. Again, I took off my handkerchief and thought again of the bread in the little shop. Oh, just for a crust! Just one mouthful to quiet the torment of starvation! Instinctively, I turned back towards the village. I found the shop again, went inside, and despite others being present besides the woman, I dared to ask, 'Would you trade a roll for this handkerchief?' She looked at me with clear suspicion. 'No,' she said, 'I never do business like that.' Almost completely desperate, I asked for half a cake; she refused again. 'How am I supposed to know where you got the handkerchief?' she asked. 'Would you take my gloves?' 'No! What would I do with them?' Reader, it's painful to recount these details. Some claim there is satisfaction in looking back on past suffering, but even now, I find it hard to revisit the times I'm describing. The combination of moral humiliation and physical pain is too distressing a memory to willingly dwell on. I didn't blame anyone who turned me away. I felt it was to be expected and unavoidable. An ordinary beggar is often viewed with suspicion; a well-dressed beggar is inevitably so. Of course, what I was asking for was employment, but whose responsibility was it to provide me with a job? Certainly not people who had just met me and knew nothing about me. And as for the woman who wouldn't trade her bread for my handkerchief, she was right if the offer seemed questionable or the exchange unprofitable to her. Let me summarize now. I am weary of this subject.",
          "paraphrase_gpt-4.1-2025-04-14": "Around two in the afternoon, I arrived in the village. At the end of the village's only street was a small shop with loaves of bread displayed in its window. I longed desperately for one, believing that eating it might restore my strength; otherwise, it would be hard to continue. The sight of other people renewed my wish for energy, and I was determined not to collapse from hunger in public. I wondered if I had anything to trade for a roll—perhaps my silk handkerchief or gloves—but was unsure whether such items would even be accepted. Regardless, I felt I had to attempt it.\n\nUpon entering the shop, the woman behind the counter, assuming I was a respectable lady, greeted me politely and asked how she could help. Embarrassed, I found myself unable to voice my request or offer the handkerchief or gloves, feeling it would be ridiculous. Instead, I merely asked to sit for a few minutes to rest, which she granted without enthusiasm. I was close to tears, but restrained myself, knowing now was not the time. After a moment, I inquired whether there were any dressmakers or needleworkers in the village, to which she replied that there were a few, but not much work for them.\n\nRealizing I was at my limit, with no friends, no money, and no resources, I knew I needed to do something—apply for any work available. I asked the woman if she knew of any places nearby looking for a servant; she did not. I asked what jobs were common in the area: most people did farm work or were employed at the local factory or foundry, but only men worked there. She didn’t know what jobs the women did, noting only that poor people did what they could. She seemed uninterested in further questions, and as more people came in, I left the shop.\n\nWalking through the village, I considered each house for any opportunity but found none. For over an hour, I wandered restlessly, becoming weaker with hunger and finally sat under a hedge in a country lane. Unable to rest, I got up and searched again for help. At the top of the lane stood a pleasant-looking house with a beautiful garden. Although I doubted anyone inside would help a stranger, I approached and knocked. A well-dressed young woman answered, and in a weak, desperate voice, I asked if they needed a servant. She said they did not, nor did she know anywhere I could find work. She closed the door gently but left me outside, feeling even lower.\n\nI could not face returning to the unfriendly village. Though the woods nearby looked inviting, hunger forced me to keep hoping for human help. I loitered near houses, never daring to ask directly, painfully aware that I had no right to expect help. The afternoon wore on as I roamed the area like a lost and hungry street dog. Eventually, I saw a church spire and hurried toward it, reasoning that the parsonage might be nearby and that clergymen sometimes helped strangers. Summoning my last energy, I knocked on the kitchen door of the parsonage. An elderly woman answered, telling me the clergyman was not at home—he had gone to Marsh End due to his father’s death and would probably be gone several more weeks. There was no lady of the house, just the housekeeper. I could not bring myself to beg from her and left once more.\n\nAgain, desperate, I considered trading my handkerchief for a roll from the shop. Returning, I asked in front of other customers if the woman would give me bread for the handkerchief. She regarded me suspiciously and said she did not make exchanges like that, nor would she take my gloves, saying they were useless to her, and she had no idea where I acquired the handkerchief. \n\nIt is unpleasant to recall all these details; some say there is value in remembering past suffering, but even now, thinking about the combination of moral and physical misery pains me. I did not blame those who refused to help; suspicion is expected toward beggars, especially those who appear well-dressed. I was only seeking work, but strangers are not obliged to offer it. I could not resent the shopkeeper who refused the trade: her concerns were understandable. I will summarize my experience now, as the memory is distressing."

While the rain descends so, must I lay my head on the cold, drenched ground? I fear I cannot do otherwise: for who will receive me? But it will be very dreadful, with this feeling of hunger, faintness, chill, and this sense of desolation—this total prostration of hope. In all likelihood, though, I should die before morning. And why cannot I reconcile myself to the prospect of death? Why do I struggle to retain a valueless life? Because I know, or believe, Mr. Rochester is living: and then, to die of want and cold is a fate to which nature cannot submit passively. Oh, Providence! sustain me a little longer! Aid!—direct me!”\nMy glazed eye wandered over the dim and misty landscape. I saw I had strayed far from the village: it was quite out of sight. The very cultivation surrounding it had disappeared. I had, by cross-ways and by-paths, once more drawn near the tract of moorland; and now, only a few fields, almost as wild and unproductive as the heath from which they were scarcely reclaimed, lay between me and the dusky hill.\n“Well, I would rather die yonder than in a street or on a frequented road,” I reflected. “And far better that crows and ravens—if any ravens there be in these regions—should pick my flesh from my bones, than that they should be prisoned in a workhouse coffin and moulder in a pauper’s grave.”\nTo the hill, then, I turned. I reached it. It remained now only to find a hollow where I could lie down, and feel at least hidden, if not secure. But all the surface of the waste looked level. It showed no variation but of tint: green, where rush and moss overgrew the marshes; black, where the dry soil bore only heath. Dark as it was getting, I could still see these changes, though but as mere alternations of light and shade; for colour had faded with the daylight.\nMy eye still roved over the sullen swell and along the moor-edge, vanishing amidst the wildest scenery, when at one dim point, far in among the marshes and the ridges, a light sprang up. “That is an ignis fatuus,” was my first thought; and I expected it would soon vanish. It burnt on, however, quite steadily, neither receding nor advancing. “Is it, then, a bonfire just kindled?” I questioned. I watched to see whether it would spread: but no; as it did not diminish, so it did not enlarge. “It may be a candle in a house,” I then conjectured; “but if so, I can never reach it. It is much too far away: and were it within a yard of me, what would it avail? I should but knock at the door to have it shut in my face.”\nAnd I sank down where I stood, and hid my face against the ground. I lay still a while: the night-wind swept over the hill and over me, and died moaning in the distance; the rain fell fast, wetting me afresh to the skin. Could I but have stiffened to the still frost—the friendly numbness of death—it might have pelted on; I should not have felt it; but my yet living flesh shuddered at its chilling influence. I rose ere long.\nThe light was yet there, shining dim but constant through the rain. I tried to walk again: I dragged my exhausted limbs slowly towards it. It led me aslant over the hill, through a wide bog, which would have been impassable in winter, and was splashy and shaking even now, in the height of summer. Here I fell twice; but as often I rose and rallied my faculties. This light was my forlorn hope: I must gain it.",

But it would be truly dreadful, with this sensation of hunger, weakness, cold, and profound loneliness—this utter loss of hope. In all likelihood, though, I would die before morning. And why couldn't I accept the prospect of death? Why was I struggling to hold onto a life that seemed worthless? Because I knew, or believed, Mr. Rochester was still alive; and furthermore, nature cannot passively accept dying from lack and cold. Oh, Providence! Support me a little longer! Help! Guide me!",

I wondered if I would have to spend another night as an outcast, forced to sleep on the wet, cold ground in the heavy rain. The prospect frightened me, especially as I was hungry, faint, cold, and utterly without hope. I imagined I might not survive the night, and questioned why I couldn't accept the thought of death, or why I clung to what seemed like a worthless life. I supposed it was because I believed Mr. Rochester was still alive, and that facing death from starvation and exposure was something my nature could not simply accept. Desperate, I called out to Providence to help and guide me.\n\nMy unfocused gaze drifted across the gloomy, mist-shrouded land. I realized I had wandered far from the village, which was nowhere to be seen, and even the cultivated fields nearby had disappeared. Taking side paths, I had once again come near the moors, with only a few fields—barely more fertile than the wild heath—separating me from a dark hill.\n\nI decided that if I were to die, I would rather do so on the hill than on a public road. I thought it better if birds like crows or ravens picked my remains than for my body to end up in a pauper’s grave from a workhouse. With this thought, I headed for the hill and searched for a hollow to lie in, somewhere at least hidden, if not safe. But as I looked around, the terrain seemed flat except for some color changes: green where marshes were overgrown, black where only heath grew. Even in the deepening darkness, I could just make out these differences as patches of light and shade rather than color.\n\nMy eyes wandered over the restless land until, far in the marshes, I noticed a faint light appear. At first, I thought it must be a will-o’-the-wisp and expected it to disappear, but it continued to shine steadily. I wondered if it might be a newly lit bonfire, but it neither grew nor shrank. Then I considered it could be a candle in a distant house, though reaching it seemed impossible, and even if I did, I doubted I’d be welcomed.\n\nDiscouraged, I collapsed to the ground, burying my face and lying still while the rain beat down and the wind howled around me. I wished for the numbness that comes with death, but my living body still reacted to the chill. Eventually, I got up.\n\nThe light still glimmered steadily through the rain, and I forced myself to move toward it, dragging my weary limbs over the hill and through a vast, sodden bog that would have been impassable in winter, and was treacherous enough in summer. I stumbled and fell twice, but each time managed to get up and continue. That light was my last hope—I had to reach it."

            "Jane arduously navigates a treacherous marsh, falling twice but propelled by the singular hope the distant light offers.",

            "As she draws nearer, the light is suddenly obscured by a low wall, palisades, and a dense hedge.",
            "Groping her way along the barrier, she discovers a wicket gate and passes through it.",
            "The house before her appears dark, and she fears its occupants have already retired for the night.",
            "Upon turning a corner of the building, she sees the friendly gleam again, this time pinpointing its source: a very small, ivy-obscured latticed window close to the ground.",
            "By stooping and moving aside the foliage, Jane is able to see clearly into the room: a meticulously clean kitchen with a sanded floor, a glowing peat fire, a walnut dresser with pewter plates, a clock, a table, and chairs. The candle that had been her beacon burns on the table.",
            "She observes an elderly woman, rough-looking but scrupulously clean (Hannah), knitting by the candlelight.",
            "More significantly, she sees two young, graceful women (Diana and Mary) dressed in deep mourning, seated near the hearth and engrossed in reading. A large pointer dog rests its head on one sister's knee, while a black cat is curled in the lap of the other.",
            "Jane is struck by the refined appearance of these women in such a humble setting and feels an odd sense of familiarity with their features, though she would not describe them as conventionally beautiful due to their pallor and gravity.",
            "They seem to be engaged in scholarly work, comparing smaller books with larger volumes, possibly for translation. The entire scene is remarkably silent.",
            "The silence is broken when one sister (Diana) urges the other (Mary) to listen as she reads a passage aloud in a language Jane does not recognize (German), which she evidently finds powerful.",
            "Mary repeats a line from the reading, a line Jane would come to understand later.",
            "Hannah, the elderly woman, inquires about the language, and the sisters explain it is German, which they are studying with the aim of teaching it to improve their financial situation, acknowledging the difficulty of learning it without a tutor.",
            "Diana notes it is ten o'clock and expresses a wish for their brother, St. John, to return home. She then asks Hannah to attend to the fire in the parlour.",
            "Hannah's return from the parlour is marked by sadness as she mentions the loneliness of the room with their father's chair now empty, alluding to his recent death.",
            "The sisters ask if their father mentioned them before he passed; Hannah explains his death was sudden, leaving no time for last words. She recounts his peaceful passing and comments on family resemblances, likening Mary to their mother and Diana to their father.",
            "Jane, observing them, notes their shared fair complexions and intelligent faces, with subtle differences in hair color and style.",
            "As Hannah begins to prepare supper, the sisters appear ready to move to the parlour. This impending change jolts Jane from her absorbed observation, and the full weight of her desperate situation crashes back upon her, appearing even more hopeless in contrast to the domestic peace she has witnessed.",
            "She feels an overwhelming sense of impossibility at the thought of conveying her needs to the inhabitants or inducing them to offer her aid."

          "text_segment": "Having crossed the marsh, I saw a trace of white over the moor. I approached it; it was a road or a track: it led straight up to the light, which now beamed from a sort of knoll, amidst a clump of trees—firs, apparently, from what I could distinguish of the character of their forms and foliage through the gloom. My star vanished as I drew near: some obstacle had intervened between me and it. I put out my hand to feel the dark mass before me: I discriminated the rough stones of a low wall—above it, something like palisades, and within, a high and prickly hedge. I groped on. Again a whitish object gleamed before me: it was a gate—a wicket; it moved on its hinges as I touched it. On each side stood a sable bush—holly or yew.\nEntering the gate and passing the shrubs, the silhouette of a house rose to view, black, low, and rather long; but the guiding light shone nowhere. All was obscurity. Were the inmates retired to rest? I feared it must be so. In seeking the door, I turned an angle: there shot out the friendly gleam again, from the lozenged panes of a very small latticed window, within a foot of the ground, made still smaller by the growth of ivy or some other creeping plant, whose leaves clustered thick over the portion of the house wall in which it was set. The aperture was so screened and narrow, that curtain or shutter had been deemed unnecessary; and when I stooped down and put aside the spray of foliage shooting over it, I could see all within. I could see clearly a room with a sanded floor, clean scoured; a dresser of walnut, with pewter plates ranged in rows, reflecting the redness and radiance of a glowing peat-fire. I could see a clock, a white deal table, some chairs. The candle, whose ray had been my beacon, burnt on the table; and by its light an elderly woman, somewhat rough-looking, but scrupulously clean, like all about her, was knitting a stocking.\nI noticed these objects cursorily only—in them there was nothing extraordinary. A group of more interest appeared near the hearth, sitting still amidst the rosy peace and warmth suffusing it. Two young, graceful women—ladies in every point—sat, one in a low rocking-chair, the other on a lower stool; both wore deep mourning of crape and bombazeen, which sombre garb singularly set off very fair necks and faces: a large old pointer dog rested its massive head on the knee of one girl—in the lap of the other was cushioned a black cat.\nA strange place was this humble kitchen for such occupants! Who were they? They could not be the daughters of the elderly person at the table; for she looked like a rustic, and they were all delicacy and cultivation. I had nowhere seen such faces as theirs: and yet, as I gazed on them, I seemed intimate with every lineament. I cannot call them handsome—they were too pale and grave for the word: as they each bent over a book, they looked thoughtful almost to severity. A stand between them supported a second candle and two great volumes, to which they frequently referred, comparing them, seemingly, with the smaller books they held in their hands, like people consulting a dictionary to aid them in the task of translation. This scene was as silent as if all the figures had been shadows and the firelit apartment a picture: so hushed was it, I could hear the cinders fall from the grate, the clock tick in its obscure corner; and I even fancied I could distinguish the click-click of the woman’s knitting-needles. When, therefore, a voice broke the strange stillness at last, it was audible enough to me.\n“Listen, Diana,” said one of the absorbed students; “Franz and old Daniel are together in the night-time, and Franz is telling a dream from which he has awakened in terror—listen!” And in a low voice she read something, of which not one word was intelligible to me; for it was in an unknown tongue—neither French nor Latin. Whether it were Greek or German I could not tell.\n“That is strong,” she said, when she had finished: “I relish it.” The other girl, who had lifted her head to listen to her sister, repeated, while she gazed at the fire, a line of what had been read. At a later day, I knew the language and the book; therefore, I will here quote the line: though, when I first heard it, it was only like a stroke on sounding brass to me—conveying no meaning:—\n“‘Da trat hervor Einer, anzusehen wie die Sternen Nacht.’ Good! good!” she exclaimed, while her dark and deep eye sparkled. “There you have a dim and mighty archangel fitly set before you! The line is worth a hundred pages of fustian. ‘Ich wäge die Gedanken in der Schale meines Zornes und die Werke mit dem Gewichte meines Grimms.’ I like it!”\nBoth were again silent.\n“Is there ony country where they talk i’ that way?” asked the old woman, looking up from her knitting.\n“Yes, Hannah—a far larger country than England, where they talk in no other way.”\n“Well, for sure case, I knawn’t how they can understand t’ one t’other: and if either o’ ye went there, ye could tell what they said, I guess?”\n“We could probably tell something of what they said, but not all—for we are not as clever as you think us, Hannah. We don’t speak German, and we cannot read it without a dictionary to help us.”\n“And what good does it do you?”\n“We mean to teach it some time—or at least the elements, as they say; and then we shall get more money than we do now.”\n“Varry like: but give ower studying; ye’ve done enough for to-night.”\n“I think we have: at least I’m tired. Mary, are you?”\n“Mortally: after all, it’s tough work fagging away at a language with no master but a lexicon.”\n“It is, especially such a language as this crabbed but glorious Deutsch. I wonder when St. John will come home.”\n“Surely he will not be long now: it is just ten (looking at a little gold watch she drew from her girdle). It rains fast, Hannah: will you have the goodness to look at the fire in the parlour?”\nThe woman rose: she opened a door, through which I dimly saw a passage: soon I heard her stir a fire in an inner room; she presently came back.\n“Ah, childer!” said she, “it fair troubles me to go into yond’ room now: it looks so lonesome wi’ the chair empty and set back in a corner.”\nShe wiped her eyes with her apron: the two girls, grave before, looked sad now.\n“But he is in a better place,” continued Hannah: “we shouldn’t wish him here again. And then, nobody need to have a quieter death nor he had.”\n“You say he never mentioned us?” inquired one of the ladies.\n“He hadn’t time, bairn: he was gone in a minute, was your father. He had been a bit ailing like the day before, but naught to signify; and when Mr. St. John asked if he would like either o’ ye to be sent for, he fair laughed at him. He began again with a bit of a heaviness in his head the next day—that is, a fortnight sin’—and he went to sleep and niver wakened: he wor a’most stark when your brother went into t’ chamber and fand him. Ah, childer! that’s t’ last o’ t’ old stock—for ye and Mr. St. John is like of different soart to them ’at’s gone; for all your mother wor mich i’ your way, and a’most as book-learned. She wor the pictur’ o’ ye, Mary: Diana is more like your father.”\nI thought them so similar I could not tell where the old servant (for such I now concluded her to be) saw the difference. Both were fair complexioned and slenderly made; both possessed faces full of distinction and intelligence. One, to be sure, had hair a shade darker than the other, and there was a difference in their style of wearing it; Mary’s pale brown locks were parted and braided smooth: Diana’s duskier tresses covered her neck with thick curls. The clock struck ten.\n“Ye’ll want your supper, I am sure,” observed Hannah; “and so will Mr. St. John when he comes in.”\nAnd she proceeded to prepare the meal. The ladies rose; they seemed about to withdraw to the parlour. Till this moment, I had been so intent on watching them, their appearance and conversation had excited in me so keen an interest, I had half-forgotten my own wretched position: now it recurred to me. More desolate, more desperate than ever, it seemed from contrast. And how impossible did it appear to touch the inmates of this house with concern on my behalf; to make them believe in the truth of my wants and woes—to induce them to vouchsafe a rest for my wanderings!",
          "paraphrase_gemini-2.5-flash-preview-04-17": "After traversing the marsh, I spotted a white line on the moor. As I approached, I saw it was a road or track that led directly towards the light, which was now coming from a slight elevation among a group of trees, apparently firs based on their shapes and foliage in the dim light. As I drew near, my guiding light disappeared, hidden by an obstacle. I reached out my hand to feel the dark shape before me and found the rough stones of a low wall, topped by something resembling vertical posts and a dense, spiky hedge inside. I moved along, feeling my way. Another pale object became visible ahead: a gate, a wicket gate. It swung open when I touched its hinges. Dark bushes, either holly or yew, stood on either side. Stepping through the gate and past the bushes, the outline of a house appeared, dark, low, and rather long, but the guiding light was no longer anywhere to be seen. All was dark. Had the residents gone to bed? I feared this was likely. Searching for the door, I turned a corner, and the welcoming gleam reappeared. It shone from a very small latticed window with diamond-shaped panes, barely a foot from the ground. It was made even smaller by thick ivy or some other creeping plant whose leaves clustered heavily over the wall where it was set. The opening was so narrow and obscured that curtains or shutters must have been considered unnecessary. When I stooped down and pushed aside the leaves covering it, I could see clearly into the room. I saw a room with a clean, sanded floor; a walnut dresser displaying rows of polished pewter plates that reflected the warm, bright glow of a peat fire. I could see a clock, a plain wooden table, and some chairs. The candle whose light had guided me burned on the table. By its light, an older woman, somewhat plain-faced but meticulously clean, like everything around her, was knitting a stocking. I only observed these things briefly; there was nothing unusual about them. A more intriguing group was seated near the hearth, still and peaceful in the rosy warmth it cast. Two young women, clearly refined ladies, sat there – one in a low rocking chair, the other on a low stool. Both wore deep black mourning attire of crape and bombazine, a dark dress that notably highlighted their very fair complexions. A large old pointer dog rested its heavy head on the knee of one young woman, while a black cat was cushioned on the lap of the other. This simple kitchen seemed a strange setting for such occupants! Who were they? They couldn't be the elderly woman's daughters, as she appeared rustic, while they were the picture of delicacy and refinement. I had never seen faces quite like theirs, yet as I looked, each feature felt strangely familiar. I couldn't call them beautiful; they were too pale and serious for that description. Both were absorbed in books, looking thoughtful almost to the point of sternness. A stand between them held a second candle and two large volumes they often consulted, comparing them, it seemed, with the smaller books in their hands, like people using a dictionary to assist with translation. The scene was as silent as if the figures were shadows and the firelit room a painting. It was so quiet that I could hear the cinders falling from the grate, the clock ticking in its dim corner, and I even imagined I could distinguish the subtle click of the woman's knitting needles. Therefore, when a voice finally broke the strange stillness, it was quite audible to me. \"Listen, Diana,\" said one of the absorbed students. \"Franz and old Daniel are together at night, and Franz is telling about a dream he woke from in terror – listen!\" She then read something softly, but I could not understand a single word; it was in an unfamiliar language, neither French nor Latin. I could not tell if it was Greek or German. \"That is powerful,\" she said when she finished. \"I appreciate it.\" The other sister, who had raised her head to listen, repeated a line of what had been read while gazing at the fire. At a later time, I learned the language and the book, so I will quote the line here, although when I first heard it, it was just noise to me, like a strike on sounding brass, carrying no meaning: \"'Da trat hervor Einer, anzusehen wie die Sternen Nacht.' Good! Good!\" she exclaimed, her dark, deep eyes sparkling. \"There, you have a mysterious and mighty archangel vividly presented! That line is worth a hundred pages of pompous writing. 'Ich wäge die Gedanken in der Schale meines Zornes und die Werke mit dem Gewichte meines Grimms.' I like it!\" Both were silent once more. \"Is there anywhere folks talk like that?\" the old woman asked, looking up from her knitting. \"Yes, Hannah,\" said one of the young women, \"a much larger country than England, where they speak no other way.\" \"Well, honestly, I don't know how they can understand one another,\" Hannah said. \"And if either of you went there, you could understand what they said, I suppose?\" \"We could probably understand some of what they said, but not everything,\" replied the young woman, \"for we are not as clever as you believe us to be, Hannah. We don't speak German, and we cannot read it without a dictionary to help us.\" \"And what benefit does it bring you?\" Hannah inquired. \"We intend to teach it someday,\" one explained, \"or at least the basic elements, as they say, and then we shall earn more money than we do now.\" \"Very likely,\" said Hannah, \"but stop studying now; you've done sufficient work for tonight.\" \"I think we have,\" one agreed. \"At least I'm tired. Are you, Mary?\" \"Extremely,\" Mary responded. \"After all, it's hard work diligently studying a language with no teacher but a dictionary.\" \"It is,\" the first woman agreed, \"especially a difficult but wonderful language like this German. I wonder when St. John will return home.\" \"Surely he won't be long now,\" Mary said, checking a small gold watch she pulled from her belt. \"It is precisely ten. It is raining heavily, Hannah; would you be kind enough to check the fire in the parlour?\" The woman rose and opened a door, through which I dimly saw a hallway. Soon I heard her attending to a fire in an inner room; she returned shortly. \"Oh, children!\" she sighed, \"it truly saddens me to go into that room now. It looks so desolate with the chair empty and pushed back into a corner.\" She wiped her eyes with her apron. The two girls, who had been serious before, now looked sad. \"But he is in a better place,\" Hannah continued. \"We should not wish him back here. And truly, no one could have had a more peaceful death than he did.\" \"You say he never mentioned us?\" one of the ladies asked. \"He did not have time, child,\" Hannah replied. \"Your father was gone in an instant. He had been slightly unwell the day before, but nothing significant; and when Mr. St. John asked if he would like either of you to be sent for, he simply laughed at him. He felt a bit of a heaviness in his head again the next day – that was two weeks ago – and he went to sleep and never woke up. He was nearly stiff when your brother went into the room and found him. Ah, children! That is the last of the old generation – for you and Mr. St. John are of a different kind from those who are gone, even though your mother was much like you and almost as well-read. She was the image of you, Mary; Diana is more like your father.\" I thought them so similar I couldn't see the difference the old servant (for I now concluded that was her role) perceived. Both had fair complexions and slender builds; both possessed faces that showed intelligence and distinction. One, to be sure, had hair a shade darker than the other, and they styled it differently. Mary's pale brown hair was parted and smoothly braided, while Diana's darker tresses covered her neck in thick curls. The clock struck ten. \"You will want your supper, I am sure,\" Hannah observed, \"and so will Mr. St. John when he arrives.\" And she proceeded to prepare the meal. The ladies rose; they seemed about to retire to the parlour. Until this moment, I had been so engrossed in watching them, their appearance and conversation had sparked such strong interest in me, that I had partly forgotten my own desperate situation. Now it came back to me. By contrast, it seemed even more desolate and hopeless than before. And how impossible it felt to make the occupants of this house care about my plight, to convince them of the truth of my needs and sorrows, or to persuade them to offer me a rest from my wandering.",
          "paraphrase_gpt-4.1-2025-04-14": "After crossing the marshland, I noticed a pale streak on the moor. As I got closer, I realized it was a road or pathway that led directly toward a light shining from a small hill among a cluster of trees, which I thought were firs based on their shapes and leaves seen through the darkness. The light disappeared as I approached, blocked by something. Reaching out, I touched a rough stone wall topped with something like a fence, and behind it, a tall, prickly hedge. I continued moving and soon saw a faintly white object ahead—a small gate that swung open at my touch, flanked by dark bushes, probably holly or yew.\n\nOnce through the gate and past the shrubs, the outline of a house appeared: it was long, low, and black against the night, with no sign of the light that had led me there—everything was dark. I wondered if everyone inside had gone to bed. Searching for the door, I rounded a corner and spotted the welcoming light again, shining from a tiny lattice window close to the ground, almost hidden by thick ivy or some climbing plant covering that section of the wall. The window was so thoroughly screened by foliage that no curtain or shutter was needed; when I brushed aside the leaves and bent down, I could see everything inside. The room was clean with a sanded floor, a walnut dresser lined with shining pewter plates catching the red glow from a peat fire. I saw a clock, a white wooden table, chairs, and a candle—the source of the guiding light—on the table, next to an elderly woman, plainly dressed but very tidy, busily knitting a stocking.\n\nI only glanced briefly at these things, for none were truly remarkable. What caught my eye was a more interesting group by the cozy hearth: two elegant young women, unmistakably ladies, one seated in a rocking-chair, the other on a low stool. They wore deep black mourning clothes, which contrasted with their fair skin and features. A large old pointer dog rested its head on one girl’s knee, while a black cat curled up in the other’s lap. Their refined presence seemed out of place in such a simple kitchen—who could they be? Surely not the elderly woman's daughters, for she was rustic while they were delicate and cultured. I had never seen such faces, though they felt strangely familiar. They weren’t quite beautiful—too pale and serious—but appeared absorbed in their books, looking thoughtful to the point of severity. On a stand between them was another candle and two large volumes, which they consulted with the smaller books in their hands, like people translating with a dictionary. The scene was so still it felt like a picture: I could hear the fire crackle, the clock tick, and possibly the soft clicking of the woman’s needles. When a voice finally broke the silence, it was clear to me.\n\n“Listen, Diana,” said one of the young women. “Franz and old Daniel are together at night, and Franz is describing a terrifying dream—listen!” She read aloud in a language I didn’t recognize—not French or Latin. Was it Greek or German, I wondered. When she finished, she commented on the strength of the passage, and her sister repeated a line, gazing into the fire. Later, I would come to know the language and book, but at that moment the words were meaningless—just sounds to me. The sister exclaimed on the power of the verse, and both girls fell silent again.\n\nThe old woman, looking up from her knitting, asked if there was anywhere people spoke like that. The girls replied that a country much larger than England used such language, though they admitted their understanding was limited—they needed a dictionary to read it. She asked what purpose the study served, and they explained they hoped to teach it and earn more money in time. The woman told them to end their studies for the night, and the girls agreed they were tired; one observed that learning a language by dictionary was hard work, especially one as difficult as German, and wondered when St. John would return. The other replied he’d be home soon, mentioning the time. The servant went to tend the fire in another room and returned, expressing how lonely the parlor felt since someone’s death. She wiped her eyes; the girls grew sad. Hannah, the servant, continued that the deceased was in a better place and had died peacefully. One girl asked if he’d mentioned them; Hannah replied that he hadn’t, passing quickly after feeling unwell, and that their brother found him already dead. She reminisced about the family, noting the girls’ differences; Mary took after their mother, Diana after their father.\n\nI thought they looked much alike, although one’s hair was slightly darker and styled differently. The clock struck ten, and Hannah mentioned they and Mr. St. John would need supper, so she began to prepare the meal. The ladies seemed about to move to the parlor. Until then, I had been so absorbed in observing them—their appearance and conversation captivated me—that I had half forgotten my own dire predicament. Now it returned to me, making my loneliness and desperation feel even greater by contrast. How could I possibly move these people to care about my hardship, to believe my suffering, and offer me the refuge I so needed?"

Hannah opened.\n“What do you want?” she inquired, in a voice of surprise, as she surveyed me by the light of the candle she held.\n“May I speak to your mistresses?” I said.\n“You had better tell me what you have to say to them. Where do you come from?”\n“I am a stranger.”\n“What is your business here at this hour?”\n“I want a night’s shelter in an out-house or anywhere, and a morsel of bread to eat.”\nDistrust, the very feeling I dreaded, appeared in Hannah’s face. “I’ll give you a piece of bread,” she said, after a pause; “but we can’t take in a vagrant to lodge. It isn’t likely.”\n“Do let me speak to your mistresses.”\n“No, not I. What can they do for you? You should not be roving about now; it looks very ill.”\n“But where shall I go if you drive me away? What shall I do?”\n“Oh, I’ll warrant you know where to go and what to do. Mind you don’t do wrong, that’s all. Here is a penny; now go—”\n“A penny cannot feed me, and I have no strength to go farther. Don’t shut the door:—oh, don’t, for God’s sake!”\n“I must; the rain is driving in—”\n“Tell the young ladies. Let me see them—”\n“Indeed, I will not. You are not what you ought to be, or you wouldn’t make such a noise. Move off.”\n“But I must die if I am turned away.”\n“Not you. I’m fear’d you have some ill plans agate, that bring you about folk’s houses at this time o’ night. If you’ve any followers—housebreakers or such like—anywhere near, you may tell them we are not by ourselves in the house; we have a gentleman, and dogs, and guns.” Here the honest but inflexible servant clapped the door to and bolted it within.\nThis was the climax. A pang of exquisite suffering—a throe of true despair—rent and heaved my heart. Worn out, indeed, I was; not another step could I stir. I sank on the wet doorstep: I groaned—I wrung my hands—I wept in utter anguish. Oh, this spectre of death! Oh, this last hour, approaching in such horror! Alas, this isolation—this banishment from my kind! Not only the anchor of hope, but the footing of fortitude was gone—at least for a moment; but the last I soon endeavoured to regain.\n“I can but die,” I said, “and I believe in God. Let me try to wait His will in silence.”\nThese words I not only thought, but uttered; and thrusting back all my misery into my heart, I made an effort to compel it to remain there—dumb and still.\n“All men must die,” said a voice quite close at hand; “but all are not condemned to meet a lingering and premature doom, such as yours would be if you perished here of want.”\n“Who or what speaks?” I asked, terrified at the unexpected sound, and incapable now of deriving from any occurrence a hope of aid. A form was near—what form, the pitch-dark night and my enfeebled vision prevented me from distinguishing. With a loud long knock, the new-comer appealed to the door.\n“Is it you, Mr. St. John?” cried Hannah.\n“Yes—yes; open quickly.”\n“Well, how wet and cold you must be, such a wild night as it is! Come in—your sisters are quite uneasy about you, and I believe there are bad folks about. There has been a beggar-woman—I declare she is not gone yet!—laid down there. Get up! for shame! Move off, I say!”\n“Hush, Hannah! I have a word to say to the woman. You have done your duty in excluding, now let me do mine in admitting her. I was near, and listened to both you and her. I think this is a peculiar case—I must at least examine into it. Young woman, rise, and pass before me into the house.”",
          "paraphrase_gemini-2.5-flash-preview-04-17": "Fumbling my way to the door and knocking hesitantly, I felt that my last idea was just a fantasy. Hannah answered. \"What do you want?\" she asked, surprised, looking at me in the light of her candle. I replied, \"May I speak with your mistresses?\" She countered, \"You should tell me what you need to say to them. Where are you from?\" I said simply, \"I am a stranger.\" \"Why are you here at this hour?\" she pressed. \"I need a place to stay for the night, perhaps in an outbuilding or anywhere, and something small to eat.\" The very thing I feared, suspicion, showed on Hannah's face. After a pause, she said, \"I'll give you some bread, but we cannot let a wanderer lodge here. It's not reasonable.\" \"Please, just let me talk to your mistresses.\" \"Absolutely not. What could they do for you? You shouldn't be wandering around at this time; it looks very bad.\" I asked desperately, \"But where am I supposed to go if you turn me away? What will I do?\" She scoffed, \"Oh, I'm sure you know where to go and what to do. Just be careful not to do anything wrong, that's all. Here's a penny; now leave—\" I pleaded, \"A penny won't feed me, and I don't have the strength to go any further. Don't shut the door—oh, please, for the love of God, don't!\" \"I have to; the rain is coming in—\" I begged, \"Tell the young ladies. Let me see them—\" Adamantly, she refused, \"Indeed, I will not. You are not who you should be, or you wouldn't be making such a disturbance. Go away.\" \"But I might die if you refuse me.\" \"Not likely. I suspect you're plotting something bad, coming around people's homes at this time of night. If you have any accomplices—burglars or the like—nearby, you can tell them we are not alone in the house; we have a gentleman, dogs, and weapons.\" At this, the upright but unyielding servant slammed the door shut and bolted it from the inside. This was the absolute worst. A sharp stab of extreme pain—a moment of true hopelessness—tore and convulsed my heart. I was utterly exhausted; I couldn't take another step. I collapsed onto the wet doorstep, groaning, wringing my hands, and crying in complete agony. Oh, this terrifying image of death! Oh, this final hour, approaching with such dread! Alas, this isolation—this separation from my fellow human beings! Not only had the anchor of hope been lost, but my ability to endure had also vanished—at least momentarily; but I quickly tried to regain the latter. I told myself, \"I can only die, and I trust in God. I will try to await His will silently.\" I not only thought these words but spoke them aloud; pushing all my suffering back into my heart, I forced myself to make it stay there—quiet and unmoving. \"Everyone must die,\" a voice said very close by; \"but not everyone is fated to face a slow, premature death like yours would be if you perished here from lack of help.\" \"Who or what is speaking?\" I asked, startled by the sudden sound and no longer capable of finding hope in anything that happened. A shape was near—but the total darkness and my failing sight prevented me from making out what it was. With a loud, prolonged knock, the newcomer rapped on the door. \"Is that you, Mr. St. John?\" Hannah called out. \"Yes—yes; open quickly.\" \"Well, you must be so wet and cold on such a terrible night! Come in—your sisters were quite worried about you, and I believe there are bad people around. There was a beggar woman—I can't believe she's still here!—lying right there. Get up! Shame on you! Move off, I said!\" \"Quiet, Hannah! I need a word with the woman. You have done your duty by keeping her out, now let me do mine by bringing her in. I was close by and heard both of you. I think this situation is unusual—I must investigate it. Young woman, please stand up and come into the house ahead of me.\"",
          "paraphrase_gpt-4.1-2025-04-14": "As I felt my way to the door and knocked on it uncertainly, I realized my last thought was just an illusion. Hannah answered the door.\n\n\"What do you want?\" she asked, clearly surprised as she looked at me in the candlelight.\n\n\"Could I speak to your mistresses?\" I requested.\n\n\"You’d best tell me what you want with them. Where do you come from?\"\n\n\"I’m a stranger.\"\n\n\"Why are you here so late?\"\n\n\"I just need somewhere to sleep for the night—a shed or something—and a bit of bread.\"\n\nSuspicion, exactly what I’d feared, showed on Hannah’s face. After a short pause, she replied, \"I’ll give you some bread, but we can’t let a vagrant stay here. That’s not possible.\"\n\n\"Please, let me speak to your mistresses.\"\n\n\"No, I won’t. What could they do for you? You shouldn’t be wandering around at this time—it looks bad.\"\n\n\"But where can I go if you send me away? What can I do?\"\n\n\"Oh, I’m sure you know how to get by. Just don’t get into trouble, that’s all. Here’s a penny—now leave.\"\n\n\"A penny won’t feed me, and I’m too weak to go on. Please don’t close the door—please, for God’s sake!\"\n\n\"I have to close it—it’s raining in.\"\n\n\"Please tell the young ladies. Let me see them—\"\n\n\"No, I won’t. If you were decent, you wouldn’t make such a fuss. Move along.\"\n\n\"But if I’m turned away, I’ll die.\"\n\n\"Nonsense. I think you’re up to no good, showing up at people’s houses at this hour. If you’ve got anyone hiding—robbers or the like—let them know we’re not alone. There’s a gentleman here, and dogs, and guns.\" With that, the steadfast but honest servant slammed the door and locked it.\n\nThat was the breaking point. A sharp pain and overwhelming despair overtook me. I was completely exhausted—unable to move another step. I collapsed on the wet doorstep, groaned, wrung my hands, and wept in total misery. The idea of dying haunted me; the horror of this final moment, so dreadful, filled me with sorrow. Being so alone, so cast out from humanity! I had lost not only hope but even my courage—at least briefly, though I soon tried to regain it.\n\n\"All I can do is die,\" I said. \"I believe in God. I must try to wait silently for His will.\"\n\nI not only thought these words but said them aloud, pushing all my suffering back into my heart and forcing myself to contain it in silence.\n\n\"Everyone dies,\" spoke a voice very close by, \"but not everyone has to face a slow and untimely death like yours would be if you starved here.\"\n\n\"Who’s there?\" I asked, startled by the unexpected sound, unable now to hope for help from anyone. Someone stood nearby, but I couldn’t see who it was in the dark and with my weakened state. The newcomer rapped loudly on the door.\n\n\"Is that you, Mr. St. John?\" Hannah called.\n\n\"Yes—it’s me. Open quickly.\"\n\n\"You must be soaked and cold out on such a stormy night! Come in—your sisters are worried about you, and I think there are bad people around. There was a beggar woman—I see she’s still there! Get up! Move on!\"\n\n\"Wait, Hannah! Let me speak to her. You’ve done your part in keeping her out—now let me do mine by letting her in. I heard your conversation. I think this is a special situation; I must at least look into it. Young woman, stand up, and come into the house.\""

Presently I stood within that clean, bright kitchen—on the very hearth—trembling, sickening; conscious of an aspect in the last degree ghastly, wild, and weather-beaten. The two ladies, their brother, Mr. St. John, the old servant, were all gazing at me.\n“St. John, who is it?” I heard one ask.\n“I cannot tell: I found her at the door,” was the reply.\n“She does look white,” said Hannah.\n“As white as clay or death,” was responded. “She will fall: let her sit.”\nAnd indeed my head swam: I dropped, but a chair received me. I still possessed my senses, though just now I could not speak.\n“Perhaps a little water would restore her. Hannah, fetch some. But she is worn to nothing. How very thin, and how very bloodless!”\n“A mere spectre!”\n“Is she ill, or only famished?”\n“Famished, I think. Hannah, is that milk? Give it me, and a piece of bread.”\nDiana (I knew her by the long curls which I saw drooping between me and the fire as she bent over me) broke some bread, dipped it in milk, and put it to my lips. Her face was near mine: I saw there was pity in it, and I felt sympathy in her hurried breathing. In her simple words, too, the same balm-like emotion spoke: “Try to eat.”\n“Yes—try,” repeated Mary gently; and Mary’s hand removed my sodden bonnet and lifted my head. I tasted what they offered me: feebly at first, eagerly soon.\n“Not too much at first—restrain her,” said the brother; “she has had enough.” And he withdrew the cup of milk and the plate of bread.\n“A little more, St. John—look at the avidity in her eyes.”\n“No more at present, sister. Try if she can speak now—ask her her name.”\nI felt I could speak, and I answered—“My name is Jane Elliott.” Anxious as ever to avoid discovery, I had before resolved to assume an alias.\n“And where do you live? Where are your friends?”\nI was silent.\n“Can we send for any one you know?”\nI shook my head.\n“What account can you give of yourself?”\nSomehow, now that I had once crossed the threshold of this house, and once was brought face to face with its owners, I felt no longer outcast, vagrant, and disowned by the wide world. I dared to put off the mendicant—to resume my natural manner and character. I began once more to know myself; and when Mr. St. John demanded an account—which at present I was far too weak to render—I said after a brief pause—\n“Sir, I can give you no details to-night.”\n“But what, then,” said he, “do you expect me to do for you?”\n“Nothing,” I replied. My strength sufficed for but short answers. Diana took the word—\n“Do you mean,” she asked, “that we have now given you what aid you require? and that we may dismiss you to the moor and the rainy night?”\nI looked at her. She had, I thought, a remarkable countenance, instinct both with power and goodness. I took sudden courage. Answering her compassionate gaze with a smile, I said—“I will trust you. If I were a masterless and stray dog, I know that you would not turn me from your hearth to-night: as it is, I really have no fear. Do with me and for me as you like; but excuse me from much discourse—my breath is short—I feel a spasm when I speak.” All three surveyed me, and all three were silent.\n“Hannah,” said Mr. St. John, at last, “let her sit there at present, and ask her no questions; in ten minutes more, give her the remainder of that milk and bread. Mary and Diana, let us go into the parlour and talk the matter over.”\nThey withdrew. Very soon one of the ladies returned—I could not tell which. A kind of pleasant stupor was stealing over me as I sat by the genial fire. In an undertone she gave some directions to Hannah. Ere long, with the servant’s aid, I contrived to mount a staircase; my dripping clothes were removed; soon a warm, dry bed received me. I thanked God—experienced amidst unutterable exhaustion a glow of grateful joy—and slept.",
          "paraphrase_gemini-2.5-flash-preview-04-17": "With considerable effort, I did as he asked. I soon found myself inside the clean, well-lit kitchen, standing right by the fireplace, trembling and feeling sick, acutely aware of looking utterly dreadful, wild, and battered by the weather. The two women, their brother Mr. St. John, and the elderly servant were all staring at me. I heard one of them ask, \"St. John, who is this?\" He replied, \"I don't know; I discovered her at the door.\" Hannah commented, \"She certainly looks pale.\" Another voice responded, \"As pale as death or clay. She's going to collapse; let her sit.\" Indeed, my head was swimming; I fell, but a chair caught me. I still had my wits about me, though I couldn't speak at that moment. \"Perhaps a little water will revive her. Hannah, get some. But she's wasted away. How incredibly thin and how bloodless she is!\" \"A mere ghost!\" \"Is she sick, or just starving?\" \"Starving, I believe. Hannah, is that milk? Give it to me, and a piece of bread.\" Diana (I recognized her by the long curls that hung between me and the fire as she leaned over me) broke off some bread, dipped it in milk, and brought it to my lips. Her face was close to mine; I saw compassion in it and felt her hurried breathing conveyed sympathy. Her simple words also held a balm-like emotion: \"Try to eat.\" \"Yes—try,\" Mary softly echoed, and Mary's hand removed my soaked bonnet and gently raised my head. I tasted what they offered, weakly at first, but soon eagerly. Their brother advised, \"Not too much initially—hold her back; she's had sufficient.\" And he removed the cup of milk and plate of bread. \"A little more, St. John—look at the eagerness in her eyes.\" \"No more right now, sister. See if she can speak now—ask her name.\" I felt capable of speaking and replied, \"My name is Jane Elliott.\" To avoid being found, I had already decided to use a false name. \"And where do you reside? Where are your friends?\" I remained silent. \"Is there anyone we can contact for you?\" I shook my head. \"What account can you provide of yourself?\" Surprisingly, having now crossed the threshold of this house and standing face-to-face with its occupants, I no longer felt like a total outcast, a homeless wanderer disowned by the world. I dared to discard the role of a beggar and resume my true self and demeanor. I began to recognize myself again; and when Mr. St. John requested an explanation—which I was currently far too weak to give—I said after a brief pause, \"Sir, I cannot give you any specifics tonight.\" \"But then,\" he asked, \"what do you expect me to do for you?\" \"Nothing,\" I answered. I only had strength for short replies. Diana took over the conversation. \"Do you mean,\" she inquired, \"that we have now given you all the help you need, and we may send you back out onto the moor into the rainy night?\" I looked at her. I found her face remarkable, full of both strength and kindness. Sudden courage filled me. Responding to her compassionate gaze with a smile, I said, \"I will trust you. If I were just a masterless stray dog, I know you wouldn't turn me away from your fire tonight; as it is, I truly have no fear. Do with me and for me as you see fit; but please excuse me from lengthy conversation—my breath is short—I feel a spasm when I speak.\" All three surveyed me, and all three were silent. \"Hannah,\" Mr. St. John finally said, \"let her sit there for now, and don't ask her any questions; in ten more minutes, give her the rest of that milk and bread. Mary and Diana, let us go into the parlour and discuss the situation.\" They withdrew. Very shortly, one of the women returned—I couldn't tell which. A pleasant drowsiness was coming over me as I sat by the warm fire. In a low voice, she gave some instructions to Hannah. Before long, with the servant's help, I managed to climb a staircase; my soaking clothes were removed; soon, a warm, dry bed received me.

I was shaky and felt sick, aware that I must look dreadful—drawn, wild, and battered by the weather. Everyone present—the two women, their brother, Mr. St. John, and the elderly servant—were staring at me. One of the women asked St. John who I was. He answered that he didn’t know, only that he’d discovered me at their door. Hannah remarked on how pale I looked. Another agreed, saying I looked as white as a ghost or as if I were dead, and that I was about to collapse, so I should be seated. My head was spinning, and I almost fell, but managed to land in a chair. I was still aware of what was happening, but I couldn’t speak. Someone suggested that water might help revive me, so Hannah was sent to fetch some. They commented on how weak, thin, and drained I seemed, comparing me to a ghost. \"Is she sick or just starving?\" someone questioned. Mary believed I was starving. They noticed some milk and asked Hannah to give it to them along with some bread. Diana, with her distinctive long curls, broke some bread, dipped it in milk, and held it to my mouth. Her face showed pity and her rapid breathing conveyed sympathy. She gently encouraged me to eat, and Mary supported me, even removing my soaked bonnet and lifting my head. I slowly tasted the food, and soon ate it more eagerly. St. John cautioned against giving me too much at once and took away the milk and bread, but Diana pleaded for him to let me have more, noting the hunger in my eyes. St. John insisted I’d had enough and told them to see if I could now speak and to ask my name. Feeling able to reply, I told them my name was Jane Elliott, using an assumed name to avoid being found out. They asked where I lived and who my friends were, but I remained silent and shook my head when asked if they could contact anyone for me. When asked to explain myself, I suddenly felt less like an outcast and more like myself now that I was inside the house and with its residents. Although too weak to provide details, I told Mr. St. John that I couldn’t give any information that night. He wanted to know what I expected from them. I answered simply, \"Nothing.\" Diana then asked if I meant that they had done enough and could send me back out into the stormy night. I looked at her and, seeing both strength and kindness in her face, felt brave enough to respond. Smiling, I assured her that I trusted them, saying I knew they wouldn’t turn out even a stray dog, and I had no fear. I asked them to excuse me from talking much, as I was too weak to speak without pain. The three regarded me silently. Finally, Mr. St. John told Hannah to let me sit quietly, give me more milk and bread in ten minutes, and asked Mary and Diana to join him in another room to discuss the situation. They left, and a short time later, one of the ladies returned, though I couldn’t tell which. Feeling warm and slightly drowsy by the fire, I heard her quietly instructing Hannah. With the housekeeper’s help, I managed to go upstairs, change out of my wet clothes, and soon was in a dry, warm bed. Utterly exhausted but deeply grateful, I thanked God and quickly fell asleep."

          "text_segment": "The recollection of about three days and nights succeeding this is very dim in my mind. I can recall some sensations felt in that interval; but few thoughts framed, and no actions performed. I knew I was in a small room and in a narrow bed. To that bed I seemed to have grown; I lay on it motionless as a stone; and to have torn me from it would have been almost to kill me. I took no note of the lapse of time—of the change from morning to noon, from noon to evening. I observed when any one entered or left the apartment: I could even tell who they were; I could understand what was said when the speaker stood near to me; but I could not answer; to open my lips or move my limbs was equally impossible. Hannah, the servant, was my most frequent visitor. Her coming disturbed me. I had a feeling that she wished me away: that she did not understand me or my circumstances; that she was prejudiced against me. Diana and Mary appeared in the chamber once or twice a day. They would whisper sentences of this sort at my bedside—\n“It is very well we took her in.”\n“Yes; she would certainly have been found dead at the door in the morning had she been left out all night. I wonder what she has gone through?”\n“Strange hardships, I imagine—poor, emaciated, pallid wanderer!”\n“She is not an uneducated person, I should think, by her manner of speaking; her accent was quite pure; and the clothes she took off, though splashed and wet, were little worn and fine.”\n“She has a peculiar face; fleshless and haggard as it is, I rather like it; and when in good health and animated, I can fancy her physiognomy would be agreeable.”\nNever once in their dialogues did I hear a syllable of regret at the hospitality they had extended to me, or of suspicion of, or aversion to, myself. I was comforted.\nMr. St. John came but once: he looked at me, and said my state of lethargy was the result of reaction from excessive and protracted fatigue. He pronounced it needless to send for a doctor: nature, he was sure, would manage best, left to herself. He said every nerve had been overstrained in some way, and the whole system must sleep torpid a while. There was no disease. He imagined my recovery would be rapid enough when once commenced. These opinions he delivered in a few words, in a quiet, low voice; and added, after a pause, in the tone of a man little accustomed to expansive comment, “Rather an unusual physiognomy; certainly, not indicative of vulgarity or degradation.”\n“Far otherwise,” responded Diana. “To speak truth, St. John, my heart rather warms to the poor little soul. I wish we may be able to benefit her permanently.”\n“That is hardly likely,” was the reply. “You will find she is some young lady who has had a misunderstanding with her friends, and has probably injudiciously left them. We may, perhaps, succeed in restoring her to them, if she is not obstinate: but I trace lines of force in her face which make me sceptical of her tractability.” He stood considering me some minutes; then added, “She looks sensible, but not at all handsome.”\n“She is so ill, St. John.”\n“Ill or well, she would always be plain. The grace and harmony of beauty are quite wanting in those features.”",
          "paraphrase_gemini-2.5-flash-preview-04-17": "For roughly three days and nights after this event, my memory is very hazy. I can recall some physical sensations during that time, but I formed few thoughts and performed no actions. I knew I was in a small room lying in a narrow bed. I felt as though I had become part of that bed; I lay completely still, like a stone, and pulling me away would have felt almost fatal. I paid no attention to the passage of time—the shift from morning to noon, or noon to evening. I did notice when someone entered or left the room; I could even identify them; I could understand what was said if the speaker was close to me, but I could not reply; opening my mouth or moving my limbs was equally impossible. Hannah, the servant, was my most frequent visitor. Her presence unsettled me. I felt she wanted me gone, that she didn't understand me or my situation, and that she held a bias against me. Diana and Mary appeared in the room once or twice a day. They would speak quietly at my bedside, saying things like: \"It was a good decision to take her in.\" \"Yes; she would certainly have been found dead by the door in the morning if she had been left outside all night. I wonder what she has endured?\" \"Great difficulties, I imagine—poor, thin, pale wanderer!\" \"She doesn't seem uneducated, I'd guess, based on how she speaks; her accent was very refined; and the clothes she removed, though muddy and wet, were not much worn and seemed of good quality.\" \"She has a distinctive face; even gaunt and worn as it is, I rather like it; and when healthy and lively, I can imagine her appearance would be pleasing.\" Never once in their conversations did I hear any expression of regret for their kindness towards me, or any suspicion or dislike of me. This brought me comfort. Mr. St. John came only once; he observed me and stated that my sluggish state was the result of exhaustion from excessive and prolonged fatigue. He declared there was no need to send for a doctor, convinced that nature, if left alone, would manage the recovery best. He said that every nerve had been overly strained in some way, and the entire system needed to remain inactive for a while. There was no illness. He anticipated my recovery would be quite rapid once it began. He delivered these opinions briefly, in a calm, low voice, and added, after a pause, in the manner of a man unaccustomed to elaborate comments, \"Rather an unusual appearance; certainly, not indicative of vulgarity or low breeding.\" \"Quite the contrary,\" Diana responded. \"To be honest, St. John, my heart feels rather warmly towards the poor girl. I hope we can help her out permanently.\" \"That is quite unlikely,\" was his reply. \"You will probably find she is some young lady who has had a disagreement with her acquaintances and has perhaps foolishly left them. We might be able to help her return to them, if she isn't stubborn; but I detect signs of resolve in her face that make me doubtful of her pliability.\" He stood observing me for a few minutes, then added, \"She looks intelligent, but not at all attractive.\" \"She is so ill, St. John.\" \"Ill or well, she would always be plain. Those features entirely lack the charm and balance of beauty.\"",

I remember some feelings during that time, but I can recall almost no actual thoughts or actions. I was aware that I was lying in a small room on a narrow bed, so still it felt as though I had become part of it; to move me would have caused me great harm. I was unaware of how much time passed, unable to tell morning from afternoon or evening. I noticed when people entered or left the room and could recognize them and understand what they said if they were close, but I couldn’t speak or move in response—it was impossible. Hannah, the servant, was the one who visited me the most, and her presence made me uncomfortable, as if she wished I wasn’t there and didn’t understand or approve of me. Diana and Mary came in once or twice a day, whispering to each other about how glad they were to have given me shelter, noting I would have died outside if left alone, and wondering about my hardships. They remarked on my speech and manners as being refined and my clothes, while dirty and wet, were of good quality. Despite my sickly appearance, they found my features appealing and imagined I might look pleasant when healthy. I never heard any word of regret or suspicion about taking me in, which reassured me. Mr. St. John visited only once. He observed that my state was due to exhaustion and didn’t think a doctor necessary, saying I just needed rest and that I would recover soon. He commented on my unusual appearance, noting there was nothing coarse about it, and speculated I must be a young woman who’d parted ways with her family. He doubted I would be easily persuaded to return, remarking I seemed sensible but not attractive, and Diana defended me, saying I was simply very ill."

Prejudices, it is well known, are most difficult to eradicate from the heart whose soil has never been loosened or fertilised by education: they grow there, firm as weeds among stones. Hannah had been cold and stiff, indeed, at the first: latterly she had begun to relent a little; and when she saw me come in tidy and well-dressed, she even smiled.\n“What, you have got up!” she said. “You are better, then. You may sit you down in my chair on the hearthstone, if you will.”\nShe pointed to the rocking-chair: I took it. She bustled about, examining me every now and then with the corner of her eye. Turning to me, as she took some loaves from the oven, she asked bluntly—\n“Did you ever go a-begging afore you came here?”\nI was indignant for a moment; but remembering that anger was out of the question, and that I had indeed appeared as a beggar to her, I answered quietly, but still not without a certain marked firmness—\n“You are mistaken in supposing me a beggar. I am no beggar; any more than yourself or your young ladies.”\nAfter a pause she said, “I dunnut understand that: you’ve like no house, nor no brass, I guess?”\n“The want of house or brass (by which I suppose you mean money) does not make a beggar in your sense of the word.”\n“Are you book-learned?” she inquired presently.\n“Yes, very.”\n“But you’ve never been to a boarding-school?”\n“I was at a boarding-school eight years.”\nShe opened her eyes wide. “Whatever cannot ye keep yourself for, then?”\n“I have kept myself; and, I trust, shall keep myself again. What are you going to do with these gooseberries?” I inquired, as she brought out a basket of the fruit.\n“Mak’ ’em into pies.”\n“Give them to me and I’ll pick them.”\n“Nay; I dunnut want ye to do nought.”\n“But I must do something. Let me have them.”\nShe consented; and she even brought me a clean towel to spread over my dress, “lest,” as she said, “I should mucky it.”\n“Ye’ve not been used to sarvant’s wark, I see by your hands,” she remarked. “Happen ye’ve been a dressmaker?”\n“No, you are wrong. And now, never mind what I have been: don’t trouble your head further about me; but tell me the name of the house where we are.”\n“Some calls it Marsh End, and some calls it Moor House.”\n“And the gentleman who lives here is called Mr. St. John?”\n“Nay; he doesn’t live here: he is only staying a while. When he is at home, he is in his own parish at Morton.”\n“That village a few miles off?\n“Aye.”\n“And what is he?”\n“He is a parson.”\nI remembered the answer of the old housekeeper at the parsonage, when I had asked to see the clergyman. “This, then, was his father’s residence?”\n“Aye; old Mr. Rivers lived here, and his father, and grandfather, and gurt (great) grandfather afore him.”\n“The name, then, of that gentleman, is Mr. St. John Rivers?”\n“Aye; St. John is like his kirstened name.”\n“And his sisters are called Diana and Mary Rivers?”\n“Yes.”\n“Their father is dead?”\n“Dead three weeks sin’ of a stroke.”\n“They have no mother?”\n“The mistress has been dead this mony a year.”\n“Have you lived with the family long?”\n“I’ve lived here thirty year. I nursed them all three.”\n“That proves you must have been an honest and faithful servant. I will say so much for you, though you have had the incivility to call me a beggar.”\nShe again regarded me with a surprised stare. “I believe,” she said, “I was quite mista’en in my thoughts of you: but there is so mony cheats goes about, you mun forgie me.”\n“And though,” I continued, rather severely, “you wished to turn me from the door, on a night when you should not have shut out a dog.”\n“Well, it was hard: but what can a body do? I thought more o’ th’ childer nor of mysel: poor things! They’ve like nobody to tak’ care on ’em but me. I’m like to look sharpish.”\nI maintained a grave silence for some minutes.\n“You munnut think too hardly of me,” she again remarked.\n“But I do think hardly of you,” I said; “and I’ll tell you why—not so much because you refused to give me shelter, or regarded me as an impostor, as because you just now made it a species of reproach that I had no ‘brass’ and no house. Some of the best people that ever lived have been as destitute as I am; and if you are a Christian, you ought not to consider poverty a crime.”\n“No more I ought,” said she: “Mr. St. John tells me so too; and I see I wor wrang—but I’ve clear a different notion on you now to what I had. You look a raight down dacent little crater.”\n“That will do—I forgive you now. Shake hands.”\nShe put her floury and horny hand into mine; another and heartier smile illumined her rough face, and from that moment we were friends.",

It is widely acknowledged that ingrained prejudices are exceedingly difficult to remove from minds that have never been softened or cultivated by learning; they take root there as stubbornly as weeds growing among rocks. Hannah had indeed been distant and rigid at first; however, she had recently started to become a little less severe. When she observed that I had entered looking neat and properly dressed, she even smiled. “Oh, you’re awake!” she exclaimed. “You must be feeling better, then. Feel free to take a seat in my chair by the fireplace if you wish.” She indicated the rocking chair, and I occupied it. She continued her work, occasionally glancing at me out of the corner of her eye.

I am no more a beggar than you or the young ladies are.” After a pause, she commented, “I don’t understand that; you don’t seem to have a home or any money, I suppose?” “The absence of a house or money (by which I presume you mean ‘brass’) does not constitute a beggar in your understanding of the word.” “Are you educated?” she inquired shortly after. “Yes, very much so.” “But you’ve never attended a boarding school?” “I spent eight years at a boarding school.” Her eyes widened in surprise. “Then why on earth can’t you support yourself?” “I have supported myself, and I trust I will be able to do so again. What are you planning to do with these gooseberries?” I asked, as she brought out a basket of the fruit. “Turn them into pies.” “Let me have them, and I’ll prepare them.” “No; I don’t want you to do anything.” “But I need to be useful. Please let me have them.” She agreed, and she even provided me with a clean towel to protect my dress, stating, “So you don’t dirty it.” “I can tell by your hands you haven’t been used to servant’s work,” she observed. “Perhaps you were a dressmaker?” “No, that is incorrect. And now, please don’t concern yourself with what I have been; stop worrying about me. Just tell me the name of this house.” “Some call it Marsh End, and others call it Moor House.” “And the gentleman who lives here is called Mr. St. John?” “No; he doesn’t reside here permanently; he is only staying for a while. When he is at home, he is in his own parish at Morton.” “That village a few miles away?” “Yes.” “And what is his profession?” “He is a parson.” I recalled the response of the old housekeeper at the parsonage when I had asked to see the clergyman. “This, then, was his father’s home?” “Yes; the late Mr. Rivers lived here, as did his father, grandfather, and great-grandfather before him.” “So, the gentleman’s full name is Mr. St. John Rivers?” “Yes; St. John is his given name.” “And his sisters are named Diana and Mary Rivers?” “Yes.” “Their father is deceased?” “He died of a stroke three weeks ago.” “They don’t have a mother?” “The mistress passed away many years ago.” “Have you been with the family for a long time?” “I’ve lived here for thirty years. I cared for all three of them when they were children.” “That indicates you must have been a loyal and dedicated servant. I will grant you that much, even though you were impolite enough to call me a beggar.” She stared at me again with a surprised expression. “I believe,” she said, “I was completely mistaken in my opinion of you; but there are so many deceitful people around, you must forgive me.” “And furthermore,” I continued, somewhat sternly, “you wanted to turn me away from the door on a night when you shouldn’t have turned away even a dog.” “Well, it was difficult; but what else could one do? I was thinking more of the children than myself; poor things! They seem to have no one else to look after them but me. I have to be quite vigilant.” I remained silent and thoughtful for several minutes. “You shouldn’t think too poorly of me,” she remarked again. “But I do think poorly of you,” I stated, “and I will explain why—not so much because you refused me shelter or saw me as an imposter, but because you just now made it sound like a criticism that I had no ‘brass’ and no home. Some of the most virtuous people who ever lived were as impoverished as I am; and if you consider yourself a Christian, you should not regard poverty as a fault.” “No, I shouldn’t,” she agreed; “Mr. St. John tells me the same; and I see I was wrong—but my view of you is entirely different now than it was before. You appear to be a genuinely respectable little person.” “That is sufficient—I forgive you now. Let us shake hands.” She placed her hand, covered in flour and rough from work, into mine; another, more genuine smile illuminated her rugged face, and from that moment, we were friends.",

At first, Hannah had been unfriendly and aloof but was now softening. When I entered the room looking clean and well-dressed, she even smiled and remarked how I had improved and was well enough to get up, offering me her seat by the fire.\n\nShe kept an eye on me as she worked, and asked bluntly if I had ever begged before arriving there. Though insulted, I reminded myself she saw me as a beggar and calmly insisted that I wasn’t one, no more than she or the young ladies she worked for. She was puzzled, as I had no home or money. I explained that lacking those didn’t make someone a beggar.\n\nCurious, she asked about my education. I said I was very educated and had spent eight years at a boarding school, which surprised her—she wondered why I wasn’t able to support myself. I replied that I had done so and hoped to again, then changed the subject to gooseberries she was carrying. I offered to help pick them, insisting I needed something to do, and she agreed, giving me a towel to protect my dress and commenting that my hands didn’t look like those of a servant. She guessed I might have been a dressmaker, which I denied, asking instead about the name of the house. She said it was called Marsh End or Moor House, and that Mr. St. John was staying there temporarily; his home was the parish of Morton nearby. I asked if he was a parson, which she confirmed, and more details followed: this was his family home, his ancestors had lived here, and his full name was St. John Rivers. His sisters were Diana and Mary, and their parents were deceased—his father just three weeks prior, the mother several years. Hannah had been with the family for thirty years and cared for all the children.\n\nI acknowledged her long service as proof of her loyalty, though I pointed out she had been rude in calling me a beggar. She was taken aback and explained she had been mistaken, but with so many dishonest people about, she couldn’t be too careful. I reminded her, perhaps a bit sternly, that she had tried to keep me out on a cruel night, but she said she was only thinking of the children’s safety, being their only protector.\n\nAfter a moment, she asked me not to judge her too harshly. I replied that I did feel critical—mainly because she treated my lack of money and home as shameful, rather than simply refusing me shelter. I told her that some of the best people throughout history have been poor, and that, as a Christian, she shouldn't judge someone by their poverty. She agreed, saying Mr. St. John had told her the same, and conceded she had misjudged me; she now thought better of me. I forgave her, we shook hands, and from that point onward, we became friends."

But she could remember Bill Oliver’s father a journeyman needlemaker; and th’ Rivers wor gentry i’ th’ owd days o’ th’ Henrys, as onybody might see by looking into th’ registers i’ Morton Church vestry.” Still, she allowed, “the owd maister was like other folk—naught mich out o’ t’ common way: stark mad o’ shooting, and farming, and sich like.” The mistress was different. She was a great reader, and studied a deal; and the “bairns” had taken after her. There was nothing like them in these parts, nor ever had been; they had liked learning, all three, almost from the time they could speak; and they had always been “of a mak’ of their own.” Mr. St. John, when he grew up, would go to college and be a parson; and the girls, as soon as they left school, would seek places as governesses: for they had told her their father had some years ago lost a great deal of money by a man he had trusted turning bankrupt; and as he was now not rich enough to give them fortunes, they must provide for themselves. They had lived very little at home for a long while, and were only come now to stay a few weeks on account of their father’s death; but they did so like Marsh End and Morton, and all these moors and hills about. They had been in London, and many other grand towns; but they always said there was no place like home; and then they were so agreeable with each other—never fell out nor “threaped.” She did not know where there was such a family for being united.",

She claimed Marsh End had belonged to the Rivers family since its construction, asserting it was 'aboon two hundred year old' despite appearing small and modest, not comparable to Mr. Oliver’s grand house in Morton Vale. However, she pointed out that she remembered Bill Oliver’s father being a simple needlemaker, while the Rivers were gentry back in the days of the Henrys, which anyone could confirm by checking the registers in Morton Church. Still, she admitted her old master was much like others – 'naught mich out o’ t’ common way,' being very keen on shooting, farming, and similar pursuits. The mistress was different; she was an avid reader and studied extensively, and the children, or 'bairns,' resembled her. According to Hannah, there was no one else like them in the region, past or present; all three had loved learning almost from when they could talk and had always been unique individuals. She said Mr. St. John intended to attend university and become a clergyman when he was older. As for the girls, they planned to become governesses as soon as they finished school. They had confided in Hannah that their father had suffered significant financial losses years prior due to a trusted person going bankrupt. Since he was no longer wealthy enough to provide them with dowries, they needed to support themselves. They hadn't spent much time at home for a long while, only returning for a few weeks now following their father’s death. Yet, they truly cherished Marsh End and Morton, along with the surrounding moors and hills. They had travelled to London and many other grand cities, but they always maintained there was no place like home. Moreover, they got along wonderfully, never arguing or 'threaping' (disputing). Hannah declared she knew of no other family that was so united.",
          "paraphrase_gpt-4.1-2025-04-14": "Hannah was clearly someone who liked to chat. As I gathered fruit and she prepared pastry for the pies, she began sharing various stories about her late employers and their children, whom she affectionately called 'the childer.' She described old Mr. Rivers as an unassuming but respectable gentleman, whose family had owned Marsh End for over two centuries, despite its modest appearance in comparison to grander estates like Mr. Oliver's hall in Morton Vale. Hannah pointed out that, unlike Mr. Oliver, whose father had worked as a needlemaker, the Rivers had been gentry since the days of the early Henrys, as confirmed by old church records. Nevertheless, she admitted the old master had his quirks—he was obsessed with hunting, farming, and similar pursuits. The mistress, on the other hand, was studious and well-read, traits that her children inherited. There was nobody quite like them in the area; ever since childhood, all three enjoyed learning and were unique in their ways. Mr. St. John, the son, was destined for college and the clergy, while the daughters would become governesses since their father had suffered financial losses years prior and couldn’t afford to provide them with dowries, requiring them to support themselves. They had spent little time at home for many years, but had come back for a few weeks after their father’s passing. Despite having visited major cities like London, they always claimed to prefer their home at Marsh End and its surrounding moors and hills, where they felt happiest. They also got along remarkably well, never quarreling, and Hannah remarked that she didn’t know of another family so closely bonded."

The old-fashioned chairs were very bright, and the walnut-wood table was like a looking-glass. A few strange, antique portraits of the men and women of other days decorated the stained walls; a cupboard with glass doors contained some books and an ancient set of china. There was no superfluous ornament in the room—not one modern piece of furniture, save a brace of workboxes and a lady’s desk in rosewood, which stood on a side-table: everything—including the carpet and curtains—looked at once well worn and well saved.\nMr. St. John—sitting as still as one of the dusty pictures on the walls, keeping his eyes fixed on the page he perused, and his lips mutely sealed—was easy enough to examine. Had he been a statue instead of a man, he could not have been easier. He was young—perhaps from twenty-eight to thirty—tall, slender; his face riveted the eye; it was like a Greek face, very pure in outline: quite a straight, classic nose; quite an Athenian mouth and chin. It is seldom, indeed, an English face comes so near the antique models as did his. He might well be a little shocked at the irregularity of my lineaments, his own being so harmonious. His eyes were large and blue, with brown lashes; his high forehead, colourless as ivory, was partially streaked over by careless locks of fair hair.\nThis is a gentle delineation, is it not, reader? Yet he whom it describes scarcely impressed one with the idea of a gentle, a yielding, an impressible, or even of a placid nature. Quiescent as he now sat, there was something about his nostril, his mouth, his brow, which, to my perceptions, indicated elements within either restless, or hard, or eager. He did not speak to me one word, nor even direct to me one glance, till his sisters returned. Diana, as she passed in and out, in the course of preparing tea, brought me a little cake, baked on the top of the oven.",

The living room was fairly small, furnished very simply, yet it felt comfortable due to its cleanliness and order. The vintage chairs were very bright, and the walnut table was so polished it reflected like a mirror. A few unusual, old portraits of people from past eras decorated the discolored walls; a cabinet with glass doors held some books and an antique china set. There were no unnecessary decorations in the room—nothing modern at all, except for two workboxes and a lady's rosewood desk placed on a side table: everything, including the rug and curtains, appeared both heavily used and well-maintained. Mr. St. John, seated as motionless as one of the faded pictures on the walls, with his eyes fixed on the book he was reading and his lips silently closed, was quite easy to observe. He couldn't have been simpler to study if he had been a statue. He was young, perhaps between twenty-eight and thirty, tall and slender; his face was captivating; it resembled a Greek face, with extremely pure lines: a perfectly straight, classical nose; a distinctly Athenian mouth and chin. It is truly rare for an English face to be as close to ancient ideals as his was. He might reasonably have been somewhat surprised by the unevenness of my features, given how balanced his own were. His eyes were large and blue, with brown eyelashes; his high forehead, as pale as ivory, was partly covered by casually arranged strands of fair hair. This description is gentle, isn't it, reader? Yet the man it portrays hardly gave the impression of a gentle, submissive, easily influenced, or even a calm nature. As still as he was sitting at that moment, there was something about his nostrils, mouth, and forehead that, to me, suggested underlying elements that were either restless, stern, or intense. He did not speak a single word to me, nor even look my way, until his sisters came back. Diana, while moving about preparing tea, brought me a small cake baked on the top of the oven.",

He had large blue eyes with brown lashes, a high pale forehead partially covered by fair hair.\n\nAlthough this description may seem gentle, the man himself did not give an impression of gentleness or softness.

Hannah says you have had nothing but some gruel since breakfast.”\nI did not refuse it, for my appetite was awakened and keen. Mr. Rivers now closed his book, approached the table, and, as he took a seat, fixed his blue pictorial-looking eyes full on me. There was an unceremonious directness, a searching, decided steadfastness in his gaze now, which told that intention, and not diffidence, had hitherto kept it averted from the stranger.\n“You are very hungry,” he said.\n“I am, sir.” It is my way—it always was my way, by instinct—ever to meet the brief with brevity, the direct with plainness.\n“It is well for you that a low fever has forced you to abstain for the last three days: there would have been danger in yielding to the cravings of your appetite at first. Now you may eat, though still not immoderately.”\n“I trust I shall not eat long at your expense, sir,” was my very clumsily-contrived, unpolished answer.\n“No,” he said coolly: “when you have indicated to us the residence of your friends, we can write to them, and you may be restored to home.”\n“That, I must plainly tell you, is out of my power to do; being absolutely without home and friends.”\nThe three looked at me, but not distrustfully; I felt there was no suspicion in their glances: there was more of curiosity. I speak particularly of the young ladies. St. John’s eyes, though clear enough in a literal sense, in a figurative one were difficult to fathom. He seemed to use them rather as instruments to search other people’s thoughts, than as agents to reveal his own: the which combination of keenness and reserve was considerably more calculated to embarrass than to encourage.\n“Do you mean to say,” he asked, “that you are completely isolated from every connection?”\n“I do. Not a tie links me to any living thing: not a claim do I possess to admittance under any roof in England.”\n“A most singular position at your age!”\nHere I saw his glance directed to my hands, which were folded on the table before me. I wondered what he sought there: his words soon explained the quest.\n“You have never been married? You are a spinster?”\nDiana laughed. “Why, she can’t be above seventeen or eighteen years old, St. John,” said she.\n“I am near nineteen: but I am not married. No.”\nI felt a burning glow mount to my face; for bitter and agitating recollections were awakened by the allusion to marriage. They all saw the embarrassment and the emotion. Diana and Mary relieved me by turning their eyes elsewhere than to my crimsoned visage; but the colder and sterner brother continued to gaze, till the trouble he had excited forced out tears as well as colour.\n“Where did you last reside?” he now asked.\n“You are too inquisitive, St. John,” murmured Mary in a low voice; but he leaned over the table and required an answer by a second firm and piercing look.\n“The name of the place where, and of the person with whom I lived, is my secret,” I replied concisely.\n“Which, if you like, you have, in my opinion, a right to keep, both from St. John and every other questioner,” remarked Diana.\n“Yet if I know nothing about you or your history, I cannot help you,” he said. “And you need help, do you not?”\n“I need it, and I seek it so far, sir, that some true philanthropist will put me in the way of getting work which I can do, and the remuneration for which will keep me, if but in the barest necessaries of life.”\n“I know not whether I am a true philanthropist; yet I am willing to aid you to the utmost of my power in a purpose so honest. First, then, tell me what you have been accustomed to do, and what you can do.”",

Hannah mentioned you haven't had anything except a bit of gruel since breakfast.” I accepted it immediately, as my hunger had become very strong and eager. Mr. Rivers closed his book, approached the table, and as he sat down, fixed his striking blue eyes directly on me. There was a straightforward, investigating, determined steadiness in his gaze now, which showed that his previous avoidance was deliberate intention, not shyness. “You are very hungry,” he observed. “I am, sir.” It is my nature—it always has been my nature, instinctively—to respond to brief statements briefly and direct questions plainly. “It's fortunate for you that a mild fever compelled you to eat little over the past three days; it would have been dangerous to give in to your intense hunger at first. Now you may eat, though still not excessively.” “I hope I won't be a financial burden for you for long, sir,” was my awkward, rather unrefined reply. “No,” he said calmly. “Once you inform us where your acquaintances reside, we can contact them, and you can be reunited with your home.” “I must state clearly, that is beyond my ability to do; I genuinely have no home and no friends.” The three of them looked at me, but without suspicion; I sensed no mistrust in their looks: rather, there was more curiosity. I'm referring particularly to the young women. St. John’s eyes, while literally clear, were figuratively hard to read. He seemed to use them more to probe other people’s thoughts than to express his own. This combination of sharp observation and reserve was considerably more likely to make one feel uncomfortable than encouraged. “Are you saying,” he inquired, “that you are entirely isolated from everyone?” “I am. No connection binds me to any living soul: I have no right to claim shelter under any roof in England.” “An exceedingly unusual situation for someone your age!” At this point, I saw his gaze shift to my hands, which were clasped on the table in front of me. I wondered what he was looking for there; his subsequent words soon clarified his aim. “You have never been married? You are unmarried?” Diana chuckled. “Why, she can't be older than seventeen or eighteen, St. John,” she said. “I am almost nineteen; but I am not married. No.” I felt a hot flush rise to my face; for the reference to marriage brought back painful and disturbing memories. They all noticed my embarrassment and emotion. Diana and Mary helped me by looking away from my reddened face; but their more distant and stern brother continued to stare until the distress he had caused brought tears as well as colour. “Where did you live most recently?” he then asked. “You are being too inquisitive, St. John,” Mary murmured quietly; but he leaned across the table and demanded an answer with a second firm and penetrating look. “The name of the place where, and the person with whom I resided, is my secret,” I answered concisely. “Which, in my opinion, you have every right to keep, both from St. John and any other questioner,” Diana remarked. “Yet if I know nothing about you or your background, I cannot assist you,” he stated. “And you require assistance, do you not?” “I do require it, and I am seeking it to the extent, sir, that some genuinely kind person will help me find work that I am capable of doing, and the payment for which will sustain me, even if only providing the most basic necessities of life.” “I do not know if I am genuinely kind; however, I am willing to help you as much as I can with such an honest objective. First, then, tell me what you are accustomed to doing, and what you are capable of doing.”",

I didn’t turn it down, my hunger now sharp and real. Mr. Rivers put aside his book, came closer to the table, and sat down, fixing his striking blue eyes directly on me. His gaze, now unhesitant, was intense and searching, making it clear that what had previously kept him from looking at me wasn’t shyness, but intention. \n\n\"You’re very hungry,\" he observed.\n\"Yes, sir,\" I replied simply, as was my nature to answer plainly and concisely when addressed in such a manner.\n\n\"It’s fortunate you were kept from eating much these last three days because of a mild fever; otherwise, indulging your appetite right away could have been dangerous. Now you can eat, but don’t overdo it.\"\n\n\"I hope I won’t be a burden on your hospitality for long, sir,\" I responded awkwardly.\n\n\"No,\" he retorted calmly, \"once you tell us where your relatives live, we can write to them, and you can return home.\"\n\n\"I must be honest—that’s impossible. I have no home or friends.\"\n\nAll three regarded me, though not with suspicion—more with curiosity, especially the young women. St. John’s eyes, for all their clarity, were hard to interpret; it seemed he used them more to probe others’ thoughts than to reveal his own. The mix of scrutiny and restraint made me uneasy rather than reassured.\n\n\"Do you really mean,\" he asked, \"that you’re entirely alone?\"\n\n\"I do. I have no ties to anyone—no right to be welcomed under any roof in England.\"\n\n\"That’s quite an unusual situation for someone so young!\" he noted, glancing at my hands folded on the table. I wondered at his interest, but his next words clarified it.\n\n\"You’ve never been married? You’re single?\"\n\nDiana laughed. \"But St. John, she can’t be more than seventeen or eighteen!\"\n\n\"I’m nearly nineteen, but I am unmarried.\"\n\nA flush of shame and painful memories at the topic of marriage filled my face. They all noticed my discomfort. Diana and Mary soon looked away, giving me some relief, but St. John’s cool and serious gaze lingered until I was brought nearly to tears.\n\n\"Where did you last live?\" he pressed.\n\nMary murmured that he was being too inquisitive, but he leaned forward, demanding an answer with another sharp look.\n\n\"Where and with whom I lived is my secret,\" I answered succinctly.\n\n\"And in my view,\" Diana said, \"that’s your right to keep from St. John and anyone else.\"\n\n\"But if I know nothing of you or your past, I can’t help,\" he insisted. \"And you do need help, don’t you?\"\n\n\"I do, and that’s why I hope someone genuinely charitable can help me find honest work—something I’m capable of and for which I’ll be paid enough to survive, even if it’s a meager living.\"\n\n\"I can’t say if I’m truly charitable, but I’m willing to help as much as I can in such an honest aim. First, tell me what work you’ve done before, and what you are able to do.\""

This benefit conferred gives you an unlimited claim on my gratitude, and a claim, to a certain extent, on my confidence. I will tell you as much of the history of the wanderer you have harboured, as I can tell without compromising my own peace of mind—my own security, moral and physical, and that of others.\n“I am an orphan, the daughter of a clergyman. My parents died before I could know them. I was brought up a dependent; educated in a charitable institution. I will even tell you the name of the establishment, where I passed six years as a pupil, and two as a teacher—Lowood Orphan Asylum, ——shire: you will have heard of it, Mr. Rivers?—the Rev. Robert Brocklehurst is the treasurer.”\n“I have heard of Mr. Brocklehurst, and I have seen the school.”\n“I left Lowood nearly a year since to become a private governess. I obtained a good situation, and was happy. This place I was obliged to leave four days before I came here. The reason of my departure I cannot and ought not to explain: it would be useless, dangerous, and would sound incredible. No blame attached to me: I am as free from culpability as any one of you three. Miserable I am, and must be for a time; for the catastrophe which drove me from a house I had found a paradise was of a strange and direful nature. I observed but two points in planning my departure—speed, secrecy: to secure these, I had to leave behind me everything I possessed except a small parcel; which, in my hurry and trouble of mind, I forgot to take out of the coach that brought me to Whitcross. To this neighbourhood, then, I came, quite destitute. I slept two nights in the open air, and wandered about two days without crossing a threshold: but twice in that space of time did I taste food; and it was when brought by hunger, exhaustion, and despair almost to the last gasp, that you, Mr. Rivers, forbade me to perish of want at your door, and took me under the shelter of your roof. I know all your sisters have done for me since—for I have not been insensible during my seeming torpor—and I owe to their spontaneous, genuine, genial compassion as large a debt as to your evangelical charity.”\n“Don’t make her talk any more now, St. John,” said Diana, as I paused; “she is evidently not yet fit for excitement.

It calmed my unsettled nerves and allowed me to speak steadily to the perceptive young man judging me. I turned to Mr. Rivers, looking him directly in the eye, openly and without shyness, as he did me. 'You and your sisters have performed an immense service for me, Mr. Rivers,' I told him, 'the greatest one person can do for another. Through your generous hospitality, you have saved me from death. This kindness gives you an absolute right to my gratitude and, to some extent, to my trust. I will share as much of the story of the person you have sheltered as I can without jeopardizing my own well-being – my mental and physical safety – or that of others.'

I will even tell you the name of the place where I spent six years as a student and two as a teacher: Lowood Orphan Asylum, in --shire. Perhaps you've heard of it, Mr. Rivers? The treasurer is the Reverend Robert Brocklehurst.' 'I have heard of Mr. Brocklehurst and I've seen the school,' he replied. 'I left Lowood nearly a year ago to work as a private governess,' I continued. 'I found a good position and was content. However, I was forced to leave that place four days before I arrived here. I cannot, and should not, explain the reason for my departure; it would be futile, dangerous, and sound unbelievable. I was not at fault; I am as blameless as any of you three. I am, and will be for a time, deeply unhappy, because the crisis that drove me from a home I considered paradise was profoundly strange and terrible. When planning my escape, I focused on just two things: speed and secrecy. To ensure these, I had to leave everything I owned behind except a small package, which, in my haste and distress, I forgot to take from the coach that brought me to Whitcross. Thus, I arrived in this area completely without resources. I slept outdoors for two nights and wandered for two days without entering a single house. I only ate twice during that time. It was when hunger, exhaustion, and despair had brought me close to death that you, Mr. Rivers, prevented me from perishing from want at your door and took me into your home. I know everything your sisters have done for me since – I was not unaware during my apparent unconsciousness – and I owe as much to their natural, genuine compassion as I do to your Christian kindness.'

It would be pointless, unsafe, and unbelievable to explain, but know that I am not at fault. The tragic events that forced me to leave my otherwise joyful home were severe and mysterious. I left quickly and secretly, taking only a small bundle with me, but in my distress, I lost it during my coach ride to Whitcross. Thus, I arrived here with nothing. I spent two nights sleeping outside and wandered two days without shelter, eating only twice during all that time. It was when I was near collapse from hunger and exhaustion that you, Mr. Rivers, rescued me by providing shelter. I am also aware of your sisters' kindness to me, even though I seemed unresponsive, and I owe them as much for their compassion as I do you for your charity.\" At that point, Diana interjected, saying, \"Don’t make her talk any more, St. John; she’s clearly still too weak for further excitement.

Show me how to work, or how to seek work: that is all I now ask; then let me go, if it be but to the meanest cottage; but till then, allow me to stay here: I dread another essay of the horrors of homeless destitution.”\n“Indeed you shall stay here,” said Diana, putting her white hand on my head. “You shall,” repeated Mary, in the tone of undemonstrative sincerity which seemed natural to her.\n“My sisters, you see, have a pleasure in keeping you,” said Mr. St. John, “as they would have a pleasure in keeping and cherishing a half-frozen bird some wintry wind might have driven through their casement. I feel more inclination to put you in the way of keeping yourself, and shall endeavour to do so; but observe, my sphere is narrow. I am but the incumbent of a poor country parish: my aid must be of the humblest sort.

'Yes, I fear being found above all else, and I avoid anything that might lead to that discovery.' 'You are absolutely right, I'm sure,' said Diana. 'Now please, brother, let her have some peace for a while.' But after thinking for a few moments, St. John resumed his questions just as calmly and perceptively as before. 'You wouldn't want to rely on our hospitality for long,' he observed. 'I see you wish to stop depending on my sisters' compassion and, especially, my charity as soon as possible (I fully understand the distinction you're making, and I don't resent it – it's accurate). You want to be independent of us?' 'Yes, I do; I've already said so. Just show me how to work or how to find work; that's all I ask now. Then I'll leave, even if it's only for the humblest cottage. But until then, please let me remain here; I dread facing the horrors of homelessness and destitution again.' 'You certainly will stay here,' Diana said, placing her gentle hand on my head. 'You will,' Mary repeated, with her characteristic quiet sincerity. 'My sisters, you see, enjoy having you here,' said Mr. St. John, 'like they would enjoy keeping and caring for a half-frozen bird that a winter gust might have driven through their window. I feel more inclined to help you become self-sufficient, and I will try to do so, but be aware, my scope is limited. I am merely the minister of a poor country parish; my assistance will be of the most modest kind. And if you are likely to look down on small beginnings, seek help from someone more capable than I can be.' 'She has already said she is willing to do any honest work she is capable of,' Diana responded on my behalf, 'and you know, St. John, she doesn't have a choice of who helps her; she has to accept help from difficult people like you.' 'I will work as a dressmaker; I will do needlework; I will be a servant, a nursemaid, if I cannot do better,' I answered. 'Right,' said Mr. St. John, quite coolly.

I avoid anything that might reveal my true identity.”\n\n“You are absolutely right,” Diana reassured me. “Now, brother, please leave her in peace for a bit.”\n\nAfter reflecting briefly, St. John continued, just as calm and sharp as before.\n\n“You don’t wish to be dependent on us for long—you want to stop relying on my sisters’ kindness and especially my charity (and I understand and don’t take offense at the distinction—you are correct): you want to support yourself?”\n\n“I do.

I could join with Diana and Mary in all their occupations; converse with them as much as they wished, and aid them when and where they would allow me. There was a reviving pleasure in this intercourse, of a kind now tasted by me for the first time—the pleasure arising from perfect congeniality of tastes, sentiments, and principles.\nI liked to read what they liked to read: what they enjoyed, delighted me; what they approved, I reverenced. They loved their sequestered home. I, too, in the grey, small, antique structure, with its low roof, its latticed casements, its mouldering walls, its avenue of aged firs—all grown aslant under the stress of mountain winds; its garden, dark with yew and holly—and where no flowers but of the hardiest species would bloom—found a charm both potent and permanent. They clung to the purple moors behind and around their dwelling—to the hollow vale into which the pebbly bridle-path leading from their gate descended, and which wound between fern-banks first, and then amongst a few of the wildest little pasture-fields that ever bordered a wilderness of heath, or gave sustenance to a flock of grey moorland sheep, with their little mossy-faced lambs:—they clung to this scene, I say, with a perfect enthusiasm of attachment. I could comprehend the feeling, and share both its strength and truth. I saw the fascination of the locality. I felt the consecration of its loneliness: my eye feasted on the outline of swell and sweep—on the wild colouring communicated to ridge and dell by moss, by heath-bell, by flower-sprinkled turf, by brilliant bracken, and mellow granite crag. These details were just to me what they were to them—so many pure and sweet sources of pleasure. The strong blast and the soft breeze; the rough and the halcyon day; the hours of sunrise and sunset; the moonlight and the clouded night, developed for me, in these regions, the same attraction as for them—wound round my faculties the same spell that entranced theirs.\nIndoors we agreed equally well. They were both more accomplished and better read than I was; but with eagerness I followed in the path of knowledge they had trodden before me. I devoured the books they lent me: then it was full satisfaction to discuss with them in the evening what I had perused during the day. Thought fitted thought; opinion met opinion: we coincided, in short, perfectly.\nIf in our trio there was a superior and a leader, it was Diana. Physically, she far excelled me: she was handsome; she was vigorous. In her animal spirits there was an affluence of life and certainty of flow, such as excited my wonder, while it baffled my comprehension. I could talk a while when the evening commenced, but the first gush of vivacity and fluency gone, I was fain to sit on a stool at Diana’s feet, to rest my head on her knee, and listen alternately to her and Mary, while they sounded thoroughly the topic on which I had but touched. Diana offered to teach me German. I liked to learn of her: I saw the part of instructress pleased and suited her; that of scholar pleased and suited me no less. Our natures dovetailed: mutual affection—of the strongest kind—was the result. They discovered I could draw: their pencils and colour-boxes were immediately at my service. My skill, greater in this one point than theirs, surprised and charmed them. Mary would sit and watch me by the hour together: then she would take lessons; and a docile, intelligent, assiduous pupil she made. Thus occupied, and mutually entertained, days passed like hours, and weeks like days.",
          "paraphrase_gemini-2.5-flash-preview-04-17": "My fondness for the people living at Moor House increased as I got to know them better. Within days, my health had improved enough that I could spend the entire day sitting up and occasionally go for walks outside. I was able to participate in all the activities Diana and Mary engaged in, converse with them as much as they desired, and assist them whenever and wherever they permitted. There was a refreshing satisfaction in this companionship, a feeling I was experiencing for the first time – the joy that comes from a perfect alignment of preferences, feelings, and values. I enjoyed reading the same things they did; their pleasures brought me delight, and what they approved of, I respected deeply. They cherished their secluded home. I, too, found a powerful and lasting appeal in the small, grey, old building, with its low roof, leaded windows, crumbling walls, and avenue of ancient fir trees leaning due to the mountain winds; its garden, shaded by yew and holly, where only the hardiest plants bloomed. They held a strong attachment to the purple moors extending behind and around their home – to the deep valley into which the stony track leading from their gate descended, winding first through fern-covered banks and then among some of the wildest small pastures bordering a vast stretch of heath, where grey moorland sheep and their small, moss-faced lambs grazed. This landscape, I can say, was the object of their complete and enthusiastic devotion. I understood this sentiment and shared both its intensity and authenticity. I recognized the captivating quality of the location. I felt the sacredness of its solitude; my eyes were drawn to the graceful curves and expansive views – to the vibrant hues imparted to ridges and hollows by moss, by heath-bells, by flower-dotted grass, by bright bracken, and by warm-toned granite rocks. These specific features held the same significance for me as for them – representing numerous pure and delightful sources of happiness. The strong winds and gentle breezes, the stormy and the calm days, the moments of sunrise and sunset, the moonlight and the overcast nights, exerted the same pull on me in these surroundings as they did on them – casting the same enchantment over my senses that captivated theirs. Indoors, we also got along exceptionally well. Both of them were more skilled and more widely read than I was, but I eagerly followed the educational path they had already explored. I eagerly read the books they lent me; it was then immensely satisfying to discuss in the evening what I had read during the day. Our thoughts aligned; our opinions met, resulting in complete agreement on all points. If there was a leader and a superior within our group of three, it was Diana. Physically, she was far superior to me; she was attractive and full of energy. Her vibrant spirit possessed an abundance of life and a steady momentum that both astonished me and was beyond my full understanding. I could converse for a while at the start of the evening, but once my initial burst of energy and fluency subsided, I was content to sit on a stool at Diana’s feet, rest my head on her knee, and listen alternately to her and Mary as they thoroughly explored the topic I had only briefly introduced. Diana volunteered to teach me German. I enjoyed learning from her; I saw that the role of instructor pleased and suited her, just as the role of student pleased and suited me. Our personalities complemented each other perfectly; the result was a strong mutual affection. They discovered I could draw; their pencils and paint sets were immediately made available to me. My ability, which was greater than theirs in this one area, surprised and charmed them. Mary would sit and watch me for extended periods; then she would take lessons, proving to be a receptive, intelligent, and hardworking student. Engaged in these activities and finding mutual enjoyment, the days seemed to pass like hours, and the weeks like days.",
          "paraphrase_gpt-4.1-2025-04-14": "The more time I spent with the people at Moor House, the more I grew to appreciate them. Within a few days, my health had improved enough for me to spend the whole day out of bed, even going for occasional walks. I could participate in all of Diana and Mary’s daily activities, talk with them as much as they wanted, and help them whenever they let me. I found a new, refreshing happiness in being with them—a joy that came from the feeling that our tastes, values, and beliefs were perfectly in harmony.\n\nI enjoyed reading the same books they liked; what they found pleasurable delighted me, and I deeply respected what they admired. They cherished their secluded home, and I, too, found a lasting and powerful charm in the old, grey house, with its low roof and latticed windows, its worn walls and the avenue of wind-leaning fir trees, surrounded by a garden shaded with yew and holly where only the toughest flowers could thrive. They passionately loved the purple moors surrounding their house, and the deep valley toward which the rocky path wound, passing wild pastures that bordered the heath and supported a few grey sheep and their mossy-faced lambs. Their deep attachment to this scene was something I could understand and share completely. I came to see the beauty of the location and felt the specialness of its solitude. My eyes delighted in the shape of the land—the bright, wild colors of moss, heather, flowering grass, bracken, and warm-toned rocks. All these details brought me the same pure happiness they felt. Whether the wind was strong or gentle, the day rough or calm, at sunrise or sunset, in moonlight or darkness, I was just as enchanted by these surroundings as they were.\n\nInside, we got along just as well. Both Diana and Mary were more accomplished and better read than I, but I eagerly followed their example, reading the books they lent me and feeling completely satisfied discussing them together in the evenings. Our thoughts and opinions matched perfectly.\n\nIf there was a leader among us, it was Diana. She was physically superior—beautiful and strong, with an energetic spirit that amazed and perplexed me. Though I could talk with them at first in the evening, I soon preferred to quietly sit at Diana’s feet, resting my head on her knee, and listen to her and Mary as they thoroughly discussed subjects I had only briefly addressed. Diana offered to teach me German, which I enjoyed, as she seemed to take pleasure in teaching and I in learning. Our personalities complemented each other, leading to a strong, mutual affection. When they learned that I could draw, they immediately offered me their art supplies. My talent, which exceeded theirs, surprised and delighted them. Mary would watch me draw for hours and started taking lessons; she was an intelligent and dedicated student. Engaged in these pleasant activities together, the days seemed to fly by—passing as quickly as mere hours, and weeks like a few days."

One reason of the distance yet observed between us was, that he was comparatively seldom at home: a large proportion of his time appeared devoted to visiting the sick and poor among the scattered population of his parish.\nNo weather seemed to hinder him in these pastoral excursions: rain or fair, he would, when his hours of morning study were over, take his hat, and, followed by his father’s old pointer, Carlo, go out on his mission of love or duty—I scarcely know in which light he regarded it. Sometimes, when the day was very unfavourable, his sisters would expostulate. He would then say, with a peculiar smile, more solemn than cheerful—\n“And if I let a gust of wind or a sprinkling of rain turn me aside from these easy tasks, what preparation would such sloth be for the future I propose to myself?”\nDiana and Mary’s general answer to this question was a sigh, and some minutes of apparently mournful meditation.\nBut besides his frequent absences, there was another barrier to friendship with him: he seemed of a reserved, an abstracted, and even of a brooding nature. Zealous in his ministerial labours, blameless in his life and habits, he yet did not appear to enjoy that mental serenity, that inward content, which should be the reward of every sincere Christian and practical philanthropist. Often, of an evening, when he sat at the window, his desk and papers before him, he would cease reading or writing, rest his chin on his hand, and deliver himself up to I know not what course of thought; but that it was perturbed and exciting might be seen in the frequent flash and changeful dilation of his eye.\nI think, moreover, that Nature was not to him that treasury of delight it was to his sisters. He expressed once, and but once in my hearing, a strong sense of the rugged charm of the hills, and an inborn affection for the dark roof and hoary walls he called his home; but there was more of gloom than pleasure in the tone and words in which the sentiment was manifested; and never did he seem to roam the moors for the sake of their soothing silence—never seek out or dwell upon the thousand peaceful delights they could yield.",
          "paraphrase_gemini-2.5-flash-preview-04-17": "My relationship with Mr. St. John did not develop with the same ease and speed as the one I formed with his sisters. A primary reason for the distance between us was his relative absence from home; a significant portion of his time was seemingly dedicated to visiting the sick and impoverished people living across his parish. Regardless of the weather, once his morning study hours were finished, he would take his hat and, accompanied by Carlo, his father's old pointer, set off on what I perceived as either a mission of love or duty—I was uncertain which. Sometimes, on particularly bad days, his sisters would plead with him to stay home. He would then reply with a specific smile, more serious than cheerful, saying, \"If simple tasks like these can be interrupted by a gust of wind or a little rain, how can I prepare myself for the future I envision?\" Diana and Mary typically responded to this question with a sigh and a few minutes of what seemed like mournful contemplation. However, beyond his frequent absences, another obstacle to developing a friendship was his apparently reserved, introspective, and even melancholy disposition. While he was zealous in his religious work and led an irreproachable life, he did not appear to possess the inner peace and contentment that should naturally reward a truly devout Christian and active philanthropist. Often, in the evenings, sitting by the window with his desk and papers before him, he would stop reading or writing, rest his chin on his hand, and become lost in thought of a nature I could not identify, though the restless and intense nature of these thoughts was clear from the frequent flashing and changing expression in his eyes. I also felt that he did not find the same delight in nature as his sisters did. He once expressed, only once in my presence, a strong appreciation for the rugged beauty of the hills and a deep affection for his old home with its dark roof and ancient walls; but the feeling was conveyed in a tone and words that held more sadness than joy. And he never seemed to wander the moors seeking their quiet serenity or take time to appreciate the countless small, peaceful joys they could provide.",
          "paraphrase_gpt-4.1-2025-04-14": "Although I quickly became close to Mr. St John’s sisters, this friendship did not develop with him. One reason for our lack of closeness was that he was rarely at home, spending most of his time tending to the sick and poor people scattered throughout his parish. He was never deterred by bad weather; after finishing his morning studies, he would put on his hat, call his father’s old dog Carlo, and set out on his pastoral visits—whether out of love or a sense of duty, I couldn't tell. On particularly unpleasant days, his sisters would try to persuade him to stay in, but he would answer with a serious smile that if he let minor obstacles like wind or rain keep him from his easy duties, he would not be ready for the future he planned for himself. Diana and Mary usually responded with a sigh and thoughtful silence. Another obstacle to friendship was his nature: he was reserved, distant, and seemed often lost in troubled thoughts. Though conscientious and faultless in his behavior and faith, he did not have the inner peace or joy expected of someone so dedicated to helping others. In the evenings, he would often stop reading or writing, lean his head on his hand, and become absorbed in agitated thoughts, as evidenced by the restless look in his eyes. Unlike his sisters, he did not seem to find great joy in nature; he once spoke about the wild beauty of the moors and his affection for his home, but there was a note of sadness rather than happiness in his voice. He never appeared to wander the moors to enjoy their peace or dwell on the tranquility they offered."

I first got an idea of its calibre when I heard him preach in his own church at Morton. I wish I could describe that sermon: but it is past my power. I cannot even render faithfully the effect it produced on me.\nIt began calm—and indeed, as far as delivery and pitch of voice went, it was calm to the end: an earnestly felt, yet strictly restrained zeal breathed soon in the distinct accents, and prompted the nervous language. This grew to force—compressed, condensed, controlled. The heart was thrilled, the mind astonished, by the power of the preacher: neither were softened. Throughout there was a strange bitterness; an absence of consolatory gentleness; stern allusions to Calvinistic doctrines—election, predestination, reprobation—were frequent; and each reference to these points sounded like a sentence pronounced for doom. When he had done, instead of feeling better, calmer, more enlightened by his discourse, I experienced an inexpressible sadness; for it seemed to me—I know not whether equally so to others—that the eloquence to which I had been listening had sprung from a depth where lay turbid dregs of disappointment—where moved troubling impulses of insatiate yearnings and disquieting aspirations. I was sure St. John Rivers—pure-lived, conscientious, zealous as he was—had not yet found that peace of God which passeth all understanding: he had no more found it, I thought, than had I with my concealed and racking regrets for my broken idol and lost elysium—regrets to which I have latterly avoided referring, but which possessed me and tyrannised over me ruthlessly.",

I first grasped the depth of his intellect when I heard him deliver a sermon in his church at Morton. I wish I could effectively describe that sermon, but I find myself incapable. I can't even accurately convey the impact it had on me. It began quietly, and even the manner and tone of his speech remained calm throughout; however, a deeply felt but strictly controlled passion quickly emerged in his clear pronouncements and fueled his intense language. This intensity grew into a powerful, focused, and disciplined force. His preaching stirred my emotions and amazed my mind, though it offered no comfort or solace. A strange harshness permeated the entire sermon; there was no gentle consolation. He frequently made stern references to Calvinist beliefs – including election, predestination, and damnation – and each mention of these topics sounded like a definitive sentence of doom. After he finished, instead of feeling uplifted, more peaceful, or more knowledgeable from his speech, I felt an inexpressible sadness. It seemed to me – and I'm unsure if others felt the same – that the powerful speaking I had just heard originated from a deep source filled with the murky residue of disappointment, stirred by unsettling urges of unfulfilled longings and troubled ambitions. I was certain that St. John Rivers, despite his virtuous life, his strong conscience, and his dedication, had not yet achieved the profound peace from God that is beyond comprehension. I believed he had no more found it than I had with my hidden and tormenting regrets over my shattered ideal and lost happiness – regrets I have recently tried to avoid thinking about, but which ruthlessly consumed and dominated me.",

The sermon started calmly, and his delivery remained measured throughout; yet there was a passionate intensity kept firmly in check that could be heard in every clear word and energetic phrase. This intensity kept building—focused and restrained. I was left both moved and amazed by his preaching, but not soothed. The sermon was marked by a certain harshness; it lacked comforting kindness, and he often referenced stern Calvinist ideas like predestination and damnation, each time sounding as though he were passing a gloomy judgment. When he finished, rather than feeling uplifted or enlightened, I was overwhelmed with a deep sadness. It felt to me—though I cannot say if others felt the same—that his powerful words came from a place of unresolved longing and disappointment. I was convinced that St. John Rivers, despite his good, sincere, and dedicated nature, had not yet found the inner peace that faith can bring; I thought he was struggling with unrest just as I was, burdened by my own hidden griefs and lost happiness, pains I seldom spoke of but which still dominated me."

Diana and Mary were soon to leave Moor House, and return to the far different life and scene which awaited them, as governesses in a large, fashionable, south-of-England city, where each held a situation in families by whose wealthy and haughty members they were regarded only as humble dependents, and who neither knew nor sought out their innate excellences, and appreciated only their acquired accomplishments as they appreciated the skill of their cook or the taste of their waiting-woman. Mr. St. John had said nothing to me yet about the employment he had promised to obtain for me; yet it became urgent that I should have a vocation of some kind. One morning, being left alone with him a few minutes in the parlour, I ventured to approach the window-recess—which his table, chair, and desk consecrated as a kind of study—and I was going to speak, though not very well knowing in what words to frame my inquiry—for it is at all times difficult to break the ice of reserve glassing over such natures as his—when he saved me the trouble by being the first to commence a dialogue.\nLooking up as I drew near—“You have a question to ask of me?” he said.\n“Yes; I wish to know whether you have heard of any service I can offer myself to undertake?”\n“I found or devised something for you three weeks ago; but as you seemed both useful and happy here—as my sisters had evidently become attached to you, and your society gave them unusual pleasure—I deemed it inexpedient to break in on your mutual comfort till their approaching departure from Marsh End should render yours necessary.”\n“And they will go in three days now?” I said.\n“Yes; and when they go, I shall return to the parsonage at Morton: Hannah will accompany me; and this old house will be shut up.”\nI waited a few moments, expecting he would go on with the subject first broached: but he seemed to have entered another train of reflection: his look denoted abstraction from me and my business. I was obliged to recall him to a theme which was of necessity one of close and anxious interest to me.\n“What is the employment you had in view, Mr. Rivers? I hope this delay will not have increased the difficulty of securing it.”\n“Oh, no; since it is an employment which depends only on me to give, and you to accept.”\nHe again paused: there seemed a reluctance to continue. I grew impatient: a restless movement or two, and an eager and exacting glance fastened on his face, conveyed the feeling to him as effectually as words could have done, and with less trouble.\n“You need be in no hurry to hear,” he said: “let me frankly tell you, I have nothing eligible or profitable to suggest. Before I explain, recall, if you please, my notice, clearly given, that if I helped you, it must be as the blind man would help the lame. I am poor; for I find that, when I have paid my father’s debts, all the patrimony remaining to me will be this crumbling grange, the row of scathed firs behind, and the patch of moorish soil, with the yew-trees and holly-bushes in front. I am obscure: Rivers is an old name; but of the three sole descendants of the race, two earn the dependent’s crust among strangers, and the third considers himself an alien from his native country—not only for life, but in death. Yes, and deems, and is bound to deem, himself honoured by the lot, and aspires but after the day when the cross of separation from fleshly ties shall be laid on his shoulders, and when the Head of that church-militant of whose humblest members he is one, shall give the word, ‘Rise, follow Me!’”\nSt. John said these words as he pronounced his sermons, with a quiet, deep voice; with an unflushed cheek, and a coruscating radiance of glance. He resumed—\n“And since I am myself poor and obscure, I can offer you but a service of poverty and obscurity. You may even think it degrading—for I see now your habits have been what the world calls refined: your tastes lean to the ideal, and your society has at least been amongst the educated; but I consider that no service degrades which can better our race. I hold that the more arid and unreclaimed the soil where the Christian labourer’s task of tillage is appointed him—the scantier the meed his toil brings—the higher the honour. His, under such circumstances, is the destiny of the pioneer; and the first pioneers of the Gospel were the Apostles—their captain was Jesus, the Redeemer, Himself.”\n“Well?” I said, as he again paused—“proceed.”\nHe looked at me before he proceeded: indeed, he seemed leisurely to read my face, as if its features and lines were characters on a page. The conclusions drawn from this scrutiny he partially expressed in his succeeding observations.\n“I believe you will accept the post I offer you,” said he, “and hold it for a while: not permanently, though: any more than I could permanently keep the narrow and narrowing—the tranquil, hidden office of English country incumbent; for in your nature is an alloy as detrimental to repose as that in mine, though of a different kind.”\n“Do explain,” I urged, when he halted once more.\n“I will; and you shall hear how poor the proposal is,—how trivial—how cramping. I shall not stay long at Morton, now that my father is dead, and that I am my own master. I shall leave the place probably in the course of a twelve-month; but while I do stay, I will exert myself to the utmost for its improvement. Morton, when I came to it two years ago, had no school: the children of the poor were excluded from every hope of progress. I established one for boys: I mean now to open a second school for girls. I have hired a building for the purpose, with a cottage of two rooms attached to it for the mistress’s house. Her salary will be thirty pounds a year: her house is already furnished, very simply, but sufficiently, by the kindness of a lady, Miss Oliver; the only daughter of the sole rich man in my parish—Mr. Oliver, the proprietor of a needle-factory and iron-foundry in the valley. The same lady pays for the education and clothing of an orphan from the workhouse, on condition that she shall aid the mistress in such menial offices connected with her own house and the school as her occupation of teaching will prevent her having time to discharge in person. Will you be this mistress?”",
          "paraphrase_gemini-2.5-flash-preview-04-17": "About a month had passed. Diana and Mary were preparing to leave Moor House soon and go back to the very different surroundings and lives that awaited them. They worked as governesses in a large, fashionable city in southern England, each holding a position in affluent, arrogant households where they were seen merely as humble employees. Their employers neither knew nor cared about their inner worth, appreciating only their learned skills, just as they valued the ability of their cook or the taste of their lady's maid. Mr. St. John hadn't yet mentioned the job he had promised to find for me, but getting some kind of employment was becoming pressing. One morning, finding myself alone with him for a few minutes in the living room, I cautiously approached the area by the window – which served as his study, marked by his table, chair, and desk. I intended to speak, though I wasn't quite sure how to phrase my question, as it's always hard to break through the reserved nature of people like him. However, he spoke first, saving me the effort. Looking up as I came near, he said, 'You have a question to ask of me?' 'Yes,' I replied, 'I want to know if you have heard of any service I can offer myself to undertake?' 'I found or devised something for you three weeks ago,' he answered. 'But as you seemed both useful and content here – as my sisters had clearly grown fond of you, and your company gave them considerable pleasure – I thought it best not to disrupt your shared comfort until their approaching departure from Marsh End made your own exit necessary.' 'And they will leave in three days now?' I asked. 'Yes,' he confirmed. 'And when they leave, I shall return to the parsonage at Morton; Hannah will accompany me, and this old house will be closed up.' I waited for a few moments, expecting him to continue on the topic he had first brought up. But he appeared to have fallen into a different train of thought; his expression indicated he was detached from me and my concerns. I was obliged to redirect him to a subject that was, out of necessity, of close and anxious interest to me. 'What is the employment you had in view, Mr. Rivers? I hope this delay will not have increased the difficulty of securing it.' 'Oh, no,' he said. 'Since it is an employment which depends only on me to give, and you to accept.' He paused again, seeming hesitant to continue. I grew impatient. A couple of restless movements and an eager, demanding look fixed on his face conveyed my feeling to him as effectively as words could have done, and with less effort. 'You need be in no hurry to hear,' he said. 'Let me frankly tell you, I have nothing eligible or profitable to suggest. Before I explain, recall, if you please, my notice, clearly given, that if I helped you, it must be as the blind man would help the lame. I am poor; for I find that, when I have paid my father’s debts, all the patrimony remaining to me will be this crumbling grange, the row of scathed firs behind, and the patch of moorish soil, with the yew-trees and holly-bushes in front. I am obscure: Rivers is an old name; but of the three sole descendants of the race, two earn the dependent’s crust among strangers, and the third considers himself an alien from his native country—not only for life, but in death. Yes, and deems, and is bound to deem, himself honoured by the lot, and aspires but after the day when the cross of separation from fleshly ties shall be laid on his shoulders, and when the Head of that church-militant of whose humblest members he is one, shall give the word, ‘Rise, follow Me!’' St. John delivered these words as he pronounced his sermons, with a quiet, deep voice; with an unflushed cheek, and a coruscating radiance of glance. He resumed—'And since I am myself poor and obscure, I can offer you but a service of poverty and obscurity. You may even think it degrading—for I see now your habits have been what the world calls refined: your tastes lean to the ideal, and your society has at least been amongst the educated; but I consider that no service degrades which can better our race. I hold that the more arid and unreclaimed the soil where the Christian labourer’s task of tillage is appointed him—the scantier the meed his toil brings—the higher the honour. His, under such circumstances, is the destiny of the pioneer; and the first pioneers of the Gospel were the Apostles—their captain was Jesus, the Redeemer, Himself.' 'Well?' I said, as he again paused—'proceed.' He looked at me before he proceeded: indeed, he seemed leisurely to read my face, as if its features and lines were characters on a page. The conclusions drawn from this scrutiny he partially expressed in his succeeding observations. 'I believe you will accept the post I offer you,' said he, 'and hold it for a while: not permanently, though: any more than I could permanently keep the narrow and narrowing—the tranquil, hidden office of English country incumbent; for in your nature is an alloy as detrimental to repose as that in mine, though of a different kind.' 'Do explain,' I urged, when he halted once more. 'I will,' he said; 'and you shall hear how poor the proposal is,—how trivial—how cramping. I shall not stay long at Morton, now that my father is dead, and that I am my own master. I shall leave the place probably in the course of a twelve-month; but while I do stay, I will exert myself to the utmost for its improvement. Morton, when I came to it two years ago, had no school: the children of the poor were excluded from every hope of progress. I established one for boys: I mean now to open a second school for girls. I have hired a building for the purpose, with a cottage of two rooms attached to it for the mistress’s house. Her salary will be thirty pounds a year: her house is already furnished, very simply, but sufficiently, by the kindness of a lady, Miss Oliver; the only daughter of the sole rich man in my parish—Mr. Oliver, the proprietor of a needle-factory and iron-foundry in the valley. The same lady pays for the education and clothing of an orphan from the workhouse, on condition that she shall aid the mistress in such menial offices connected with her own house and the school as her occupation of teaching will prevent her having time to discharge in person. Will you be this mistress?'",
          "paraphrase_gpt-4.1-2025-04-14": "A month had passed, and it was nearly time for Diana and Mary to leave Moor House to resume their positions as governesses in a fashionable southern English city. In those households, they were treated merely as servants, valued only for their learned skills and not for their true characters, much like the staff they worked beside.\n\nMeanwhile, Mr. St. John still hadn't approached me regarding the job he had intended to find for me, and I was increasingly in need of work. One morning, we were alone together in the parlour. I worked up the courage to approach him in his study space, unsure how to ask about employment, but before I could voice my question, he began the conversation himself. \n\nHe looked up and asked if I had a question, and I replied that I wanted to know if he had found any position for me. St. John explained that he had found a role for me three weeks before, but since I seemed content and useful at Moor House and his sisters enjoyed my company, he had not wanted to disrupt our happiness until their imminent departure made it necessary.\n\nI inquired if Diana and Mary would be leaving in three days, and Mr. St. John confirmed, saying that he would return to Morton’s parsonage with Hannah and the house would be closed. When St. John lapsed into thought, I pressed him again for details about the work, anxious that my wait might have made it harder to secure the position. He assured me that the job still waited for me and depended only on my acceptance, but he hesitated, warning that it was neither prestigious nor lucrative.\n\nHe reminded me that his own situation was humble—after settling his father’s debts, he was left with just the old house and meager land. He described the Rivers family as obscure, with two daughters working as dependents and himself feeling alienated from his homeland, valuing the day when he could devote himself fully to a life apart and in service. \n\nHe added that because he himself was poor and unremarkable, he could only offer me similar work, perhaps even seen as degrading due to my refined background and tastes. However, he insisted that any work which improved humanity should be respected, and that the most difficult and unrewarding tasks carried special honor, like the early apostles who pioneered the Christian faith.\n\nI encouraged him to continue. He looked at me closely and said he believed I would accept the post for a while, but not forever, just as he could not permanently fill the passive role of a country minister due to restless aspects in our natures.\n\nHe then explained the humble nature of the offer: since taking over Morton, he had created a boys’ school and now planned to establish a girls’ school. He had already rented a building with an attached, simply furnished cottage for the schoolmistress, whose salary would be thirty pounds a year. The cottage was furnished with the help of Miss Oliver, the daughter of the parish’s only wealthy man. Miss Oliver also sponsored an orphan girl to help the mistress with household and school duties. St. John asked if I would accept the position of schoolmistress."

Mutual recrimination passed between them: they parted in anger, and were never reconciled. My uncle engaged afterwards in more prosperous undertakings: it appears he realised a fortune of twenty thousand pounds. He was never married, and had no near kindred but ourselves and one other person, not more closely related than we. My father always cherished the idea that he would atone for his error by leaving his possessions to us; that letter informs us that he has bequeathed every penny to the other relation, with the exception of thirty guineas, to be divided between St. John, Diana, and Mary Rivers, for the purchase of three mourning rings. He had a right, of course, to do as he pleased: and yet a momentary damp is cast on the spirits by the receipt of such news. Mary and I would have esteemed ourselves rich with a thousand pounds each; and to St. John such a sum would have been valuable, for the good it would have enabled him to do.”\nThis explanation given, the subject was dropped, and no further reference made to it by either Mr. Rivers or his sisters.",
          "paraphrase_gemini-2.5-flash-preview-04-17": "He tossed the letter into her lap. Diana quickly scanned it before handing it to Mary. Mary read it silently, then gave it back to her brother. All three looked at each other and shared a sad, thoughtful smile.\n\n\"Thank goodness! We can still make a living,\" Diana finally said.\n\n\"At least it doesn't leave us any worse off than we were before,\" Mary commented.\n\n\"It just rather forcefully brings to mind the thought of what *could* have been,\" Mr. Rivers remarked, \"and contrasts it perhaps too sharply with what *is*.\"\n\nHe folded the letter, locked it in his desk, and went outside again.\n\nFor several minutes, nobody spoke. Then Diana turned to me.\n\n\"Jane, you must be puzzled by us and our secrets,\" she said, \"and perhaps you think us cold for not being more upset by the death of a close relative like an uncle. But we had never met him or known him. He was our mother's brother. Our father and he had a major falling out years ago. It was on his advice that our father risked most of his money in the investment that ruined him. They blamed each other, parted angrily, and never made up. Our uncle later got involved in more successful ventures; it seems he accumulated a fortune of twenty thousand pounds. He never married and had no close family except us and one other person, who was no more closely related than we are. Our father always hoped he would compensate for his mistake by leaving us his property. This letter tells us he has left his entire fortune to the other relative, with the exception of thirty guineas, which are to be divided among St. John, Diana, and Mary Rivers, for the purpose of buying three mourning rings. Of course, he had the right to do as he pleased, but receiving such news temporarily dampens one's spirits. Mary and I would have considered ourselves wealthy with a thousand pounds each, and for St. John, such a sum would have been valuable for the good works it would have allowed him to do.\"\n\nAfter this explanation was given, the topic was dropped, and neither Mr. Rivers nor his sisters referred to it again.",
          "paraphrase_gpt-4.1-2025-04-14": "He tossed the letter into her lap. She skimmed it, then gave it to Mary, who read it quietly and handed it back to her brother. The three exchanged glances and shared a subdued, somewhat sad smile.\n\n\"Well, at least we're still alive,\" Diana said after a pause.\n\n\"It doesn’t really change our circumstances,\" Mary added.\n\n\"It just reminds us strongly of what could have been, and makes our reality seem even harsher by comparison,\" Mr. Rivers remarked.\n\nHe put the letter away in his desk and left the room. The group sat in silence for a few minutes. Then Diana addressed me: \"Jane, you probably think it odd that we seem so unmoved by an uncle’s death, but we never knew or met him. He was our mother's brother, but he and our father quarreled years ago. In fact, it was he who convinced our father to invest in the business venture that led to our ruin. They blamed each other, parted on bad terms, and never made peace. Our uncle later did well for himself and apparently made a fortune of twenty thousand pounds. He stayed single and has no closer relatives than us and one other, who isn’t much more closely related. My father always hoped he’d make up with us by leaving us his wealth, but the letter says he’s left it all to the other relation, except for thirty guineas to be split between St. John, Mary, and myself for mourning rings. Of course, it was his right to do what he wanted with his money, but receiving such news is still a disappointment. Mary and I would have felt rich with just a thousand pounds each, and St. John could have done a lot of good with that kind of money.\"\n\nWith that explanation, they dropped the subject and didn’t mention it again."

The birds were singing their last strains—\n“The air was mild, the dew was balm.”\nWhile I looked, I thought myself happy, and was surprised to find myself ere long weeping—and why? For the doom which had reft me from adhesion to my master: for him I was no more to see; for the desperate grief and fatal fury—consequences of my departure—which might now, perhaps, be dragging him from the path of right, too far to leave hope of ultimate restoration thither. At this thought, I turned my face aside from the lovely sky of eve and lonely vale of Morton—I say lonely, for in that bend of it visible to me there was no building apparent save the church and the parsonage, half-hid in trees, and, quite at the extremity, the roof of Vale Hall, where the rich Mr. Oliver and his daughter lived. I hid my eyes, and leant my head against the stone frame of my door; but soon a slight noise near the wicket which shut in my tiny garden from the meadow beyond it made me look up. A dog—old Carlo, Mr. Rivers’ pointer, as I saw in a moment—was pushing the gate with his nose, and St. John himself leant upon it with folded arms; his brow knit, his gaze, grave almost to displeasure, fixed on me. I asked him to come in.\n“No, I cannot stay; I have only brought you a little parcel my sisters left for you. I think it contains a colour-box, pencils, and paper.”\nI approached to take it: a welcome gift it was. He examined my face, I thought, with austerity, as I came near: the traces of tears were doubtless very visible upon it.\n“Have you found your first day’s work harder than you expected?” he asked.\n“Oh, no! On the contrary, I think in time I shall get on with my scholars very well.”\n“But perhaps your accommodations—your cottage—your furniture—have disappointed your expectations? They are, in truth, scanty enough; but—” I interrupted—\n“My cottage is clean and weather-proof; my furniture sufficient and commodious. All I see has made me thankful, not despondent. I am not absolutely such a fool and sensualist as to regret the absence of a carpet, a sofa, and silver plate; besides, five weeks ago I had nothing—I was an outcast, a beggar, a vagrant; now I have acquaintance, a home, a business. I wonder at the goodness of God; the generosity of my friends; the bounty of my lot. I do not repine.”\n“But you feel solitude an oppression? The little house there behind you is dark and empty.”\n“I have hardly had time yet to enjoy a sense of tranquillity, much less to grow impatient under one of loneliness.”\n“Very well; I hope you feel the content you express: at any rate, your good sense will tell you that it is too soon yet to yield to the vacillating fears of Lot’s wife. What you had left before I saw you, of course I do not know; but I counsel you to resist firmly every temptation which would incline you to look back: pursue your present career steadily, for some months at least.”\n“It is what I mean to do,” I answered.",
          "paraphrase_gemini-2.5-flash-preview-04-17": "After concluding my thoughts for the evening, I stood up, went to my door, and observed the sunset of the harvest day, as well as the peaceful fields in front of my cottage. My cottage, like the school, was situated half a mile from the village. The birds were singing their final notes, the air was mild, and the dew felt soothing. As I watched, I initially felt happy, but I was soon surprised to find myself weeping. Why was I crying? Because of the fate that had separated me from my connection to my master; I was destined never to see him again. It was also for the profound sorrow and destructive rage resulting from my departure, which might now be potentially leading him away from the right path, perhaps too far for him ever to return. At this thought, I turned my face away from the beautiful evening sky and the secluded valley of Morton. I describe it as secluded because the only visible buildings in that section were the church and the rectory, partly hidden among trees, and far in the distance, the roof of Vale Hall, where the wealthy Mr. Oliver and his daughter resided. I covered my eyes and rested my head against the stone doorframe. However, a slight sound near the small gate that enclosed my tiny garden from the adjacent meadow soon prompted me to look up. A dog—old Carlo, Mr. Rivers' pointer, as I immediately recognized—was nudging the gate with his nose. St. John himself was leaning on it with his arms crossed; his brow furrowed, his gaze serious, almost indicating displeasure, fixed upon me. I invited him to come in. \"No, I cannot stay,\" he replied. \"I've only brought you a small package my sisters left for you. I believe it contains a box of paints, some pencils, and paper.\" I stepped closer to take it; it was indeed a welcome gift. As I approached, I felt he examined my face sternly; the traces of my tears were undoubtedly quite evident. \"Have you found your first day's work more challenging than you expected?\" he inquired. \"Oh, no!\" I answered. \"Quite the contrary. I think I will get along very well with my students in time.\" \"But perhaps your living situation—your cottage—your furniture—has disappointed you? They are rather basic, it's true; but—\" I interrupted, \"My cottage is clean and protects from the weather; my furniture is sufficient and practical. Everything I see makes me feel grateful, not discouraged. I am certainly not so foolish or materialistic as to regret the absence of a carpet, a sofa, or silver cutlery. Besides, only five weeks ago I had nothing—I was an exile, a beggar, a wanderer; now I have acquaintances, a home, a job. I am amazed by God's kindness, the generosity of my friends, and the bounty of my circumstances. I do not complain.\" \"But do you feel solitude is oppressive? That small house behind you is dark and empty.\" \"I've barely had enough time yet to appreciate a sense of peace, let alone become restless due to loneliness,\" I replied. \"Very well,\" he said. \"I hope you genuinely feel the contentment you express. At any rate, your good sense will tell you it is far too early to give in to wavering fears, like Lot's wife looking back. Of course, I don't know what you left behind before I met you, but I strongly advise you to firmly resist any temptation that might make you look back. Steadily pursue your current path for at least several months.\" \"That is my intention,\" I responded.",
          "paraphrase_gpt-4.1-2025-04-14": "After reflecting on these thoughts, I stood up, opened my door, and gazed at the harvest sunset and the peaceful fields stretching before my cottage. My home, along with the school, was about half a mile from the village. As the birds sang their final songs, the gentle evening air felt soothing. In that moment, I realized I felt content, which unexpectedly brought me to tears. I cried because I mourned the loss that separated me from my master, whom I would never see again, and I worried that my leaving might have driven him into despair and caused him to stray beyond recovery. Turning away from the beautiful dusk sky and the secluded valley of Morton—where, in my view, only the church, the vicarage among trees, and far off, Vale Hall, home of Mr. Oliver and his daughter, were visible—I hid my face and leaned against the doorframe. Soon, a faint sound at the gate leading from my garden to the meadow caused me to look up. Mr. Rivers’ old dog Carlo was nosing the gate open, and beyond him stood St. John, arms folded, his expression stern and serious as he watched me. I invited him inside. He declined, saying he had only come to deliver a small package his sisters had left, likely containing art supplies. I gratefully accepted the gift. He studied me closely, noticing, I was sure, that I had been crying, and asked whether my first day’s work had been difficult. I assured him it had not, and that I thought I would manage well with my students. He wondered if my humble cottage or its sparse furnishings had disappointed me. I insisted my situation was clean, comfortable, and more than adequate for my needs. I reflected that, having once had nothing and being homeless, I now had friends, a home, and work, and was grateful rather than dissatisfied. St. John then questioned whether the solitude weighed on me, gesturing to the quiet house behind me. I replied that I had hardly had time yet to appreciate the peace, let alone become restless from loneliness. He told me that he hoped I was as content as I seemed, and advised me not to give in to doubts or look back at what I’d left behind—urging me to pursue my current path for several months. I agreed, assuring him that was my intention."

God has given us, in a measure, the power to make our own fate; and when our energies seem to demand a sustenance they cannot get—when our will strains after a path we may not follow—we need neither starve from inanition, nor stand still in despair: we have but to seek another nourishment for the mind, as strong as the forbidden food it longed to taste—and perhaps purer; and to hew out for the adventurous foot a road as direct and broad as the one Fortune has blocked up against us, if rougher than it.\n“A year ago I was myself intensely miserable, because I thought I had made a mistake in entering the ministry: its uniform duties wearied me to death. I burnt for the more active life of the world—for the more exciting toils of a literary career—for the destiny of an artist, author, orator; anything rather than that of a priest: yes, the heart of a politician, of a soldier, of a votary of glory, a lover of renown, a luster after power, beat under my curate’s surplice. I considered; my life was so wretched, it must be changed, or I must die. After a season of darkness and struggling, light broke and relief fell: my cramped existence all at once spread out to a plain without bounds—my powers heard a call from heaven to rise, gather their full strength, spread their wings, and mount beyond ken. God had an errand for me; to bear which afar, to deliver it well, skill and strength, courage and eloquence, the best qualifications of soldier, statesman, and orator, were all needed: for these all centre in the good missionary.\n“A missionary I resolved to be. From that moment my state of mind changed; the fetters dissolved and dropped from every faculty, leaving nothing of bondage but its galling soreness—which time only can heal. My father, indeed, imposed the determination, but since his death, I have not a legitimate obstacle to contend with; some affairs settled, a successor for Morton provided, an entanglement or two of the feelings broken through or cut asunder—a last conflict with human weakness, in which I know I shall overcome, because I have vowed that I will overcome—and I leave Europe for the East.”\nHe said this, in his peculiar, subdued, yet emphatic voice; looking, when he had ceased speaking, not at me, but at the setting sun, at which I looked too.",
          "paraphrase_gemini-2.5-flash-preview-04-17": "Changing one's natural tendencies and redirecting innate inclinations is difficult work, but I know from personal experience that it is possible. God has given us a certain power to shape our own destiny. When our energy seeks nourishment it cannot find, or our will strives for a path we are forbidden to take, we don't have to waste away or stand still in despair. Instead, we must find a different source of mental sustenance, one as powerful as the forbidden desire, and perhaps purer. We must carve out a path for our ambitious spirit that is as direct and broad as the one blocked by circumstances, even if it is rougher.\n\nA year ago, I was intensely unhappy because I felt I had made a mistake by becoming a minister. The monotonous duties bored me completely. I longed for a more active life in the world – for the stimulating efforts of a literary career, or the fate of an artist, author, or speaker; anything but being a priest. Yes, under my minister's robe beat the heart of a politician, a soldier, someone who craved glory, fame, and power. I reflected that my life was so miserable it had to change, or I would die. After a time of darkness and struggle, clarity emerged, and relief came. My restricted life suddenly expanded into limitless possibility. My abilities felt a divine call to awaken, gather strength, spread their wings, and soar beyond ordinary sight. God had a purpose for me, one that required skill, strength, courage, and eloquence – the best qualities of a soldier, statesman, and orator – to carry it far and execute it well, as all these traits converge in a good missionary.\n\nI decided I would be a missionary. From that moment, my mental state transformed; the chains broke and fell from every part of me, leaving only the painful mark of bondage, which only time can heal. My father did indeed influence this decision, but since his death, I have no legitimate obstacles to overcome. I just need to settle some affairs, find a replacement for Morton, break free from or cut through one or two emotional complications – a final struggle with human weakness that I know I will overcome because I have vowed to – and then I will leave Europe for the East.\n\nHe spoke these words in his distinctively quiet yet powerful voice, looking, when he finished, not at me but at the setting sun, which I was also watching.",

God has given us, to some extent, the power to shape our own destinies. When we feel our energies craving something we cannot have—when our will wants to pursue a path we can't take—we don't have to waste away or fall into despair. Instead, we must look for a different mental nourishment that's just as fulfilling as what we've been denied, perhaps even better, and find a new road for ourselves, even if it's rougher than the one that's been blocked.\n\nA year ago, I was deeply unhappy because I believed I had erred by becoming a minister; the routine of the job exhausted me. I longed for a more active role in the world—the stimulating work of a writer, the calling of an artist, an author, or a speaker; anything instead of being a clergyman. Inside, I felt like a politician, a soldier, someone driven by ambition and glory, thirsting for power, beneath my priest's robes. My misery was so great I felt I must either change my life or die. After a period filled with darkness and struggle, I finally found clarity and relief: my restricted life suddenly expanded before me; I felt my talents urged by a divine call to rise, reach their full potential, and aspire beyond limits. God had a purpose for me, one that required me to journey far and use all my abilities—courage, skill, eloquence, the very traits of a soldier, a leader, and a speaker—qualities needed in a true missionary.\n\nSo I decided to become a missionary. From that instant, my mindset transformed; my limitations fell away, leaving only the lingering pain of what had once been oppressive—pain which only time could cure. My father may have originally pushed me towards this path, but now, since his death, there are no real obstacles left. Once a few matters are arranged, a replacement is found for Morton, and I've resolved some emotional attachments—after one final struggle with personal weakness, which I know I'll overcome because I've determined to—I will leave Europe for the East.\"\n\nHe spoke these words in his usual calm, yet forceful manner; and when he finished, he looked, not at me, but at the setting sun, which I also turned to watch."

          "text_segment": "Both he and I had our backs towards the path leading up the field to the wicket. We had heard no step on that grass-grown track; the water running in the vale was the one lulling sound of the hour and scene; we might well then start when a gay voice, sweet as a silver bell, exclaimed—\n“Good evening, Mr. Rivers. And good evening, old Carlo. Your dog is quicker to recognise his friends than you are, sir; he pricked his ears and wagged his tail when I was at the bottom of the field, and you have your back towards me now.”\nIt was true. Though Mr. Rivers had started at the first of those musical accents, as if a thunderbolt had split a cloud over his head, he stood yet, at the close of the sentence, in the same attitude in which the speaker had surprised him—his arm resting on the gate, his face directed towards the west. He turned at last, with measured deliberation. A vision, as it seemed to me, had risen at his side. There appeared, within three feet of him, a form clad in pure white—a youthful, graceful form: full, yet fine in contour; and when, after bending to caress Carlo, it lifted up its head, and threw back a long veil, there bloomed under his glance a face of perfect beauty. Perfect beauty is a strong expression; but I do not retrace or qualify it: as sweet features as ever the temperate clime of Albion moulded; as pure hues of rose and lily as ever her humid gales and vapoury skies generated and screened, justified, in this instance, the term. No charm was wanting, no defect was perceptible; the young girl had regular and delicate lineaments; eyes shaped and coloured as we see them in lovely pictures, large, and dark, and full; the long and shadowy eyelash which encircles a fine eye with so soft a fascination; the pencilled brow which gives such clearness; the white smooth forehead, which adds such repose to the livelier beauties of tint and ray; the cheek oval, fresh, and smooth; the lips, fresh too, ruddy, healthy, sweetly formed; the even and gleaming teeth without flaw; the small dimpled chin; the ornament of rich, plenteous tresses—all advantages, in short, which, combined, realise the ideal of beauty, were fully hers. I wondered, as I looked at this fair creature: I admired her with my whole heart. Nature had surely formed her in a partial mood; and, forgetting her usual stinted step-mother dole of gifts, had endowed this, her darling, with a grand-dame’s bounty.\nWhat did St. John Rivers think of this earthly angel? I naturally asked myself that question as I saw him turn to her and look at her; and, as naturally, I sought the answer to the inquiry in his countenance. He had already withdrawn his eye from the Peri, and was looking at a humble tuft of daisies which grew by the wicket.\n“A lovely evening, but late for you to be out alone,” he said, as he crushed the snowy heads of the closed flowers with his foot.\n“Oh, I only came home from S——” (she mentioned the name of a large town some twenty miles distant) “this afternoon. Papa told me you had opened your school, and that the new mistress was come; and so I put on my bonnet after tea, and ran up the valley to see her: this is she?” pointing to me.\n“It is,” said St. John.\n“Do you think you shall like Morton?” she asked of me, with a direct and naïve simplicity of tone and manner, pleasing, if child-like.\n“I hope I shall. I have many inducements to do so.”\n“Did you find your scholars as attentive as you expected?”\n“Quite.”\n“Do you like your house?”\n“Very much.”\n“Have I furnished it nicely?”\n“Very nicely, indeed.”\n“And made a good choice of an attendant for you in Alice Wood?”\n“You have indeed. She is teachable and handy.” (This then, I thought, is Miss Oliver, the heiress; favoured, it seems, in the gifts of fortune, as well as in those of nature! What happy combination of the planets presided over her birth, I wonder?)",
          "paraphrase_gemini-2.5-flash-preview-04-17": "St. John and I were both facing away from the grassy path that crossed the field towards the gate. We hadn't heard anyone approaching on the quiet ground; the only sound was the gentle flow of water in the valley below, which created a peaceful atmosphere. This is why we were surprised when a cheerful voice, clear and lovely like a silver bell, suddenly called out— \"Good evening, Mr. Rivers,\" she said. \"And good evening, old Carlo. Your dog is faster at spotting friends than you are, sir; he perked up his ears and wagged his tail when I was still far down the field, while you're still facing away from me.\" This was accurate. Although Mr. Rivers had initially reacted to the sound of her melodious voice as if shocked by a sudden thunderclap, he remained in the same pose as when she first spoke – leaning on the gate with his face turned towards the setting sun – until the end of her statement. Finally, he turned around slowly and deliberately. It seemed to me as though a beautiful apparition had appeared beside him. Standing only about three feet away was a young, elegant figure dressed in white. Her shape was well-proportioned and graceful, full but with delicate lines. After she leaned down to pet Carlo and then raised her head, pushing back a long veil, a face of exquisite beauty was revealed as St. John looked at her. Describing someone as having \"perfect beauty\" is a strong statement, but I won't take it back or modify it here. Her appearance truly warranted the phrase: her features were as lovely as England's mild climate could shape; her complexion had the pure colours of rose and lily, nurtured and protected as if by the country's damp winds and misty skies. She lacked no appealing quality, and nothing about her seemed imperfect. The young woman possessed balanced and refined features; her eyes were large, dark, and expressive, shaped and coloured like those found in beautiful paintings; her long, dark eyelashes framed her lovely eyes with gentle allure; her well-defined brows added definition; her pale, smooth forehead contributed a sense of calmness to her vibrant complexion and sparkling eyes; her cheeks were oval, healthy-looking, and smooth; her lips were also full of life, red, healthy, and attractively shaped; her teeth were perfectly straight and bright; her chin was small and subtly dimpled; and she had an abundance of thick, luxuriant hair. In summary, she possessed every attribute that, when combined, creates the perfect image of beauty. As I gazed at this beautiful person, I felt a sense of wonder and wholehearted admiration for her. It seemed certain that Nature must have been in a particularly generous mood when creating her, casting aside her usual careful distribution of gifts and instead showering this favourite child with the immense generosity of a loving grandmother. I naturally asked myself what St. John Rivers' opinion was of this incredibly beautiful woman as I watched him turn and look at her. Equally naturally, I searched his expression for the answer. However, he had already looked away from her stunning face and was instead focused on a small cluster of common daisies growing near the gate. \"It's a beautiful evening,\" he remarked, \"but it's quite late for you to be out by yourself,\" saying this as he stepped on the white blossoms of the closed daisies. \"Oh, I just arrived back this afternoon from S——\" (she named a large town about twenty miles away). \"My father mentioned that you had started your school and that the new teacher had arrived, so after tea, I put on my hat and hurried up the valley to meet her. Is this her?\" she asked, gesturing towards me. \"Yes, it is,\" St. John confirmed. \"Do you believe you'll enjoy living in Morton?\" she inquired of me directly, with a straightforward and simple way of speaking that was pleasant, although perhaps a bit childlike. \"I certainly hope so,\" I replied. \"There are many reasons for me to like it here.\" \"Did you find your students as attentive as you thought they would be?\" \"Completely.\" \"Do you like the house you're staying in?\" \"Very much indeed.\" \"Did I furnish it well?\" \"Extremely well, yes.\" \"And did I make a good selection for your helper in Alice Wood?\" \"You certainly did,\" I confirmed. \"She learns quickly and is capable.\" (So, I realised, this must be Miss Oliver, the wealthy young woman; apparently blessed with both riches and natural beauty! I wondered what exceptionally fortunate celestial alignment must have occurred at her birth.)",

We hadn’t heard anyone approach along that grassy track; the running water in the valley was the only sound in the otherwise quiet scene. It was, therefore, quite surprising when a cheerful voice, sweet and clear like a silver bell, suddenly called out:\n\n\"Good evening, Mr. Rivers. And good evening, old Carlo. Your dog notices friends sooner than you do, sir; he perked up and wagged his tail when I was still at the other end of the field, while you’ve only just now turned your back to me.\"\n\nWhat she said was true. Although Mr. Rivers had been startled by the first notes of this melodious voice, as though lightning had flashed right overhead, he remained in the same position as when she surprised him—with his arm resting on the gate, looking out towards the west. Only eventually did he turn around, calmly and deliberately. To me, it was as if a vision had appeared at his side. Just a few feet from him stood a figure dressed in pure white—a young, graceful woman, her form both elegant and full—who, after bending to pet Carlo, stood up, lifted her head, and pushed back a long veil, revealing a face of extraordinary beauty. 'Perfect beauty' is a strong phrase, but I do not take it back: her features were as sweet as any shaped by England’s temperate climate, her complexion as pure as any nurtured by its moist air and gentle light. She had every charm and no flaw I could see; her features were regular and delicate; her eyes large, dark, and expressive as those in fine portraits, surrounded by long, shadowy lashes that lent them a soft allure; her brows were finely shaped, lending clarity; her forehead was smooth and white, providing calm to the vivid beauty of her coloring; her cheeks were oval, fresh, and smooth; her lips were healthy and perfectly formed; her teeth flawless and bright; her chin small and dimpled; and her hair thick and luxurious—all the qualities that together define the ideal of beauty were hers. As I gazed at this lovely creature, I couldn’t help but admire her with all my heart. It seemed that nature had been feeling especially generous when creating her and had given her more than its usual share of gifts.\n\nNaturally, I wondered what St. John Rivers thought of this angelic young woman. I watched to see his reaction as he turned to look at her, but he had already glanced away from her to focus on a modest clump of daisies beside the gate instead.\n\n\"It’s a beautiful evening, but it’s late for you to be out alone,\" he remarked, pressing down the white flowers with his foot.\n\n\"Oh, I just came home from S——\" (she named a large town about twenty miles away) \"this afternoon.

I have plenty of reasons to.\"\n\n\"Were your students as attentive as you expected?\"\n\n\"Completely.\"\n\n\"Do you like where you’re living?\"\n\n\"Very much.\"\n\n\"Did I furnish it well?\"\n\n\"Extremely well.\"\n\n\"And did I choose the right person to help you—Alice Wood?\"\n\n\"Yes, you did. She’s willing to learn and very capable.\" (So, I thought, this is Miss Oliver, the heiress—apparently gifted in both fortune and beauty! What lucky stars must have shone the day she was born?)"

Mr. Rivers, I have been so gay during my stay at S——. Last night, or rather this morning, I was dancing till two o’clock. The ——th regiment are stationed there since the riots; and the officers are the most agreeable men in the world: they put all our young knife-grinders and scissor merchants to shame.”\nIt seemed to me that Mr. St. John’s under lip protruded, and his upper lip curled a moment. His mouth certainly looked a good deal compressed, and the lower part of his face unusually stern and square, as the laughing girl gave him this information. He lifted his gaze, too, from the daisies, and turned it on her. An unsmiling, a searching, a meaning gaze it was. She answered it with a second laugh, and laughter well became her youth, her roses, her dimples, her bright eyes.\nAs he stood, mute and grave, she again fell to caressing Carlo. “Poor Carlo loves me,” said she. “He is not stern and distant to his friends; and if he could speak, he would not be silent.”\nAs she patted the dog’s head, bending with native grace before his young and austere master, I saw a glow rise to that master’s face. I saw his solemn eye melt with sudden fire, and flicker with resistless emotion. Flushed and kindled thus, he looked nearly as beautiful for a man as she for a woman. His chest heaved once, as if his large heart, weary of despotic constriction, had expanded, despite the will, and made a vigorous bound for the attainment of liberty. But he curbed it, I think, as a resolute rider would curb a rearing steed. He responded neither by word nor movement to the gentle advances made him.\n“Papa says you never come to see us now,” continued Miss Oliver, looking up. “You are quite a stranger at Vale Hall. He is alone this evening, and not very well: will you return with me and visit him?”\n“It is not a seasonable hour to intrude on Mr. Oliver,” answered St. John.\n“Not a seasonable hour! But I declare it is. It is just the hour when papa most wants company: when the works are closed and he has no business to occupy him. Now, Mr. Rivers, do come. Why are you so very shy, and so very sombre?” She filled up the hiatus his silence left by a reply of her own.\n“I forgot!” she exclaimed, shaking her beautiful curled head, as if shocked at herself. “I am so giddy and thoughtless! Do excuse me. It had slipped my memory that you have good reasons to be indisposed for joining in my chatter. Diana and Mary have left you, and Moor House is shut up, and you are so lonely. I am sure I pity you. Do come and see papa.”\n“Not to-night, Miss Rosamond, not to-night.”",
          "paraphrase_gemini-2.5-flash-preview-04-17": "She added, “I’ll visit sometimes to help with the teaching. It will be a pleasant break for me to drop in occasionally, and I enjoy variety. Mr. Rivers, I’ve had such a wonderful time staying in S——. Just last night, or early this morning actually, I was dancing until 2 AM. The ——th regiment is stationed there since the disturbances, and their officers are the most charming men imaginable; they completely outshine our local young businessmen.” It seemed to me that Mr. St. John’s lower lip jutted out, and his upper lip momentarily curled. His mouth certainly appeared quite tight, and the bottom half of his face looked unusually grim and rigid as the cheerful young woman shared this news. He also lifted his eyes from the flowers and directed his gaze towards her. It was a serious, penetrating, and meaningful stare. She responded with another laugh, and laughter truly suited her youth, her healthy colour, her dimples, and her sparkling eyes. While he stood silent and solemn, she began stroking Carlo again. “Sweet Carlo loves me,” she said. “He isn’t severe and distant with his friends; and if he could speak, he wouldn’t stay quiet.” As she petted the dog’s head, gracefully bowing before his young, stern master, I saw a flush appear on that master’s face. I saw his serious eyes suddenly ignite with fire and tremble with uncontrollable feeling. Flushed and animated like this, he was almost as handsome for a man as she was beautiful for a woman. His chest rose once, as if his great heart, tired of being rigidly confined, had expanded despite his will and made a powerful leap for freedom. But I believe he controlled it, like a determined horseman would restrain a rearing horse. He did not respond with either words or actions to her gentle overtures. “Father says you never come to see us anymore,” Miss Oliver continued, looking up. “You’re quite a stranger at Vale Hall. He’s by himself this evening and isn’t feeling very well; would you come back with me and visit him?” “It’s not a suitable time to impose on Mr. Oliver,” St. John replied. “Not a suitable time! But I assure you it is. It’s exactly the hour when father needs company the most: when the factory is closed and he has nothing to occupy him. Please, Mr. Rivers, do come. Why are you so incredibly reserved and so very gloomy?” She filled the gap his silence created with her own explanation. “Oh, I forgot!” she exclaimed, shaking her lovely curly hair as if taken aback by herself. “I’m so flighty and thoughtless! Please forgive me. It had completely slipped my mind that you have good reasons for not wanting to join in my chatter. Diana and Mary have gone, and Moor House is closed up, and you must be so lonely. I genuinely feel for you. Please come and visit father.” “Not tonight, Miss Rosamond, not tonight.”",
          "paraphrase_gpt-4.1-2025-04-14": "She said, \"I'll come and help you teach sometimes. Visiting you now and then will be a nice change for me; I enjoy something different.

The ——th regiment has been based there since the riots, and the officers are such delightful men—they put all our local young men to shame.\" \n\nWhen she told him all this while laughing, I noticed Mr. St. John's lower lip stuck out and his upper lip curled slightly. His mouth tightened and his expression became even more stern than usual. He looked away from the flowers and gazed at her seriously, with a look that was intent and meaningful, but without a smile. She simply laughed again in response, which suited her youthful beauty—her rosy cheeks, dimples, and sparkling eyes.\n\nWhile he stood there, silent and serious, she started to pet Carlo again. \"Poor Carlo loves me,\" she said. \"He isn't stern or distant with his friends; and if he could talk, he wouldn't ignore me.\" Leaning gracefully over Carlo's head, I noticed a flush of feeling rise to St. John's face; his serious eyes suddenly brightened with passion, and he looked, in that moment, almost as handsome for a man as she was for a woman. He breathed deeply once, as if his heart, tired of being restrained, wanted to break free. But he quickly controlled himself, like a determined rider calming an unruly horse. He didn't say or do anything in response to her gentle approach.\n\n\"Father says you never come to see us these days,\" Miss Oliver went on, looking up at him. \"You're a stranger at Vale Hall now. He's alone this evening and not feeling well—won't you come back with me to visit him?\"\n\n\"It's not really a suitable time to bother Mr. Oliver,\" St. John replied.\n\n\"Not a suitable time? Oh, but it is! This is exactly when Papa wants company—when the work is done and he isn't busy. Please, Mr. Rivers, come along. Why are you always so shy and serious?\" She answered her own question, filling his silence.\n\n\"Oh, I forgot!\" she said, shaking her lovely curled hair as though scolding herself. \"I'm so thoughtless and scatterbrained! Forgive me. I forgot you have good reasons not to join my chatter. Diana and Mary have left you, Moor House is closed up, and you must feel so lonely. I really feel for you.

I found estimable characters amongst them—characters desirous of information and disposed for improvement—with whom I passed many a pleasant evening hour in their own homes. Their parents then (the farmer and his wife) loaded me with attentions. There was an enjoyment in accepting their simple kindness, and in repaying it by a consideration—a scrupulous regard to their feelings—to which they were not, perhaps, at all times accustomed, and which both charmed and benefited them; because, while it elevated them in their own eyes, it made them emulous to merit the deferential treatment they received.\nI felt I became a favourite in the neighbourhood.

To live amidst general regard, though it be but the regard of working people, is like “sitting in sunshine, calm and sweet;” serene inward feelings bud and bloom under the ray. At this period of my life, my heart far oftener swelled with thankfulness than sank with dejection: and yet, reader, to tell you all, in the midst of this calm, this useful existence—after a day passed in honourable exertion amongst my scholars, an evening spent in drawing or reading contentedly alone—I used to rush into strange dreams at night: dreams many-coloured, agitated, full of the ideal, the stirring, the stormy—dreams where, amidst unusual scenes, charged with adventure, with agitating risk and romantic chance, I still again and again met Mr. Rochester, always at some exciting crisis; and then the sense of being in his arms, hearing his voice, meeting his eye, touching his hand and cheek, loving him, being loved by him—the hope of passing a lifetime at his side, would be renewed, with all its first force and fire.

Their parents, the farmer and his wife, were exceedingly generous with their hospitality towards me. There was satisfaction in accepting their simple kindness and reciprocating it with thoughtful consideration – a meticulous attentiveness to their feelings – something they may not have always been accustomed to, which both delighted and benefited them.

A sort of instinct seemed to warn him of her entrance, even when he did not see it; and when he was looking quite away from the door, if she appeared at it, his cheek would glow, and his marble-seeming features, though they refused to relax, changed indescribably, and in their very quiescence became expressive of a repressed fervour, stronger than working muscle or darting glance could indicate.\nOf course, she knew her power: indeed, he did not, because he could not, conceal it from her. In spite of his Christian stoicism, when she went up and addressed him, and smiled gaily, encouragingly, even fondly in his face, his hand would tremble and his eye burn. He seemed to say, with his sad and resolute look, if he did not say it with his lips, “I love you, and I know you prefer me. It is not despair of success that keeps me dumb. If I offered my heart, I believe you would accept it. But that heart is already laid on a sacred altar: the fire is arranged round it. It will soon be no more than a sacrifice consumed.”\nAnd then she would pout like a disappointed child; a pensive cloud would soften her radiant vivacity; she would withdraw her hand hastily from his, and turn in transient petulance from his aspect, at once so heroic and so martyr-like. St. John, no doubt, would have given the world to follow, recall, retain her, when she thus left him; but he would not give one chance of heaven, nor relinquish, for the elysium of her love, one hope of the true, eternal Paradise. Besides, he could not bind all that he had in his nature—the rover, the aspirant, the poet, the priest—in the limits of a single passion. He could not—he would not—renounce his wild field of mission warfare for the parlours and the peace of Vale Hall. I learnt so much from himself in an inroad I once, despite his reserve, had the daring to make on his confidence.",
          "paraphrase_gemini-2.5-flash-preview-04-17": "Rosamond Oliver followed through on her promise to visit me. Her visits to the school typically occurred during her morning horseback rides. She would gallop to the entrance on her pony, accompanied by a mounted servant in livery. Her appearance was remarkably elegant, dressed in a purple riding habit with a black velvet cap perched gracefully over her long curls that framed her face and fell to her shoulders. It was in this stunning manner that she would enter the simple schoolhouse and pass through the attentive lines of village children. She usually arrived when Mr. Rivers was giving his daily catechism lesson. I believe her presence deeply affected the young clergyman. He seemed to have an intuition of her arrival, even when he didn't see her; if she appeared at the door while he was looking elsewhere, his face would flush, and his typically impassive features, although remaining controlled, would subtly change, conveying a suppressed passion stronger than any outward action or look could show.Naturally, she recognized her influence over him; indeed, he couldn't, and didn't, hide it from her. Despite his disciplined Christian composure, when she approached him, spoke, and smiled cheerfully, encouragingly, and even affectionately at him, his hand would tremble and his eyes would burn with intensity. With his somber and determined expression, he seemed to communicate, even without speaking aloud, \"I love you, and I know you prefer me. It is not a lack of confidence in success that keeps me silent. If I offered you my heart, I believe you would accept it. But that heart is already dedicated to a sacred purpose; it is surrounded by the preparatory fires and will soon be entirely consumed as a sacrifice.\"She would then show disappointment, like a child denied something; a thoughtful expression would temper her bright energy; she would quickly withdraw her hand from his and turn away briefly in frustration from his demeanor, which was both noble and self-sacrificing. St. John would no doubt have given everything to follow, call back, and keep her when she left him like this; but he would not sacrifice his chance of salvation, nor trade the paradise of her love for the hope of eternal heaven. Furthermore, he couldn't confine the full scope of his character—the explorer, the ambitious man, the pensive spirit, the devoted priest—within the bounds of a single romantic attachment. He could not, and would not, abandon his challenging missionary battlefield for the comfortable rooms and quiet life of Vale Hall. I discovered much of this from him personally during a time when, despite his usual reserve, I dared to seek his confidence.",

She would arrive elegantly, riding her pony and accompanied by a servant in livery. Her appearance in her purple riding outfit and stylish black velvet cap, with curls framing her face and shoulders, was strikingly beautiful and hard to imagine anything more lovely. She would enter the simple school building and walk gracefully past the astonished village children. She typically came when Mr. Rivers was teaching religious lessons to the students, and I suspect that her presence deeply affected him. Even when he wasn’t looking, he seemed to sense when she arrived, and the sight of her would bring color to his face and cause his usually calm features to show a strong, concealed emotion. \n\nRosamond was aware of the effect she had on him, as it was impossible for him to hide it. Despite trying to remain stoic, whenever she approached him and spoke with warmth and encouragement, his hand would shake and his eyes would light up. His expression seemed to say, even if his words did not: \"I love you, and I know you care for me. But it's not fear of rejection that keeps me silent. My heart is already devoted to a higher purpose; it's committed to a sacred cause and soon will be consumed by it.\" \n\nWhen confronted with his self-restraint, Rosamond would sometimes react with childish disappointment, her cheerful energy dimming as she quickly withdrew from him, temporarily upset by his noble distance. While St. John probably ached to follow and comfort her after such moments, he would not sacrifice his spiritual ambitions or hopes for eternal reward for the sake of her love. In addition, he could not limit his complex nature—his adventurous, ambitious, poetic, and priestly qualities—to a single romantic relationship. He was unwilling to give up his calling as a missionary for a comfortable life at Vale Hall. I learned this much from him during a conversation where I boldly asked about his feelings, despite his natural reserve."

I had learnt her whole character, which was without mystery or disguise: she was coquettish but not heartless; exacting, but not worthlessly selfish. She had been indulged from her birth, but was not absolutely spoilt. She was hasty, but good-humoured; vain (she could not help it, when every glance in the glass showed her such a flush of loveliness), but not affected; liberal-handed; innocent of the pride of wealth; ingenuous; sufficiently intelligent; gay, lively, and unthinking: she was very charming, in short, even to a cool observer of her own sex like me; but she was not profoundly interesting or thoroughly impressive. A very different sort of mind was hers from that, for instance, of the sisters of St. John. Still, I liked her almost as I liked my pupil Adèle; except that, for a child whom we have watched over and taught, a closer affection is engendered than we can give an equally attractive adult acquaintance.\nShe had taken an amiable caprice to me. She said I was like Mr. Rivers, only, certainly, she allowed, “not one-tenth so handsome, though I was a nice neat little soul enough, but he was an angel.” I was, however, good, clever, composed, and firm, like him. I was a lusus naturæ, she affirmed, as a village schoolmistress: she was sure my previous history, if known, would make a delightful romance.\nOne evening, while, with her usual child-like activity, and thoughtless yet not offensive inquisitiveness, she was rummaging the cupboard and the table-drawer of my little kitchen, she discovered first two French books, a volume of Schiller, a German grammar and dictionary, and then my drawing-materials and some sketches, including a pencil-head of a pretty little cherub-like girl, one of my scholars, and sundry views from nature, taken in the Vale of Morton and on the surrounding moors. She was first transfixed with surprise, and then electrified with delight.\n“Had I done these pictures? Did I know French and German? What a love—what a miracle I was! I drew better than her master in the first school in S——. Would I sketch a portrait of her, to show to papa?”\n“With pleasure,” I replied; and I felt a thrill of artist-delight at the idea of copying from so perfect and radiant a model. She had then on a dark-blue silk dress; her arms and her neck were bare; her only ornament was her chestnut tresses, which waved over her shoulders with all the wild grace of natural curls. I took a sheet of fine card-board, and drew a careful outline. I promised myself the pleasure of colouring it; and, as it was getting late then, I told her she must come and sit another day.",

While she could be flirtatious, she wasn't unkind; demanding, but not pointlessly self-centered. Though she had been spoiled since birth, she wasn't completely ruined. She was quick-tempered but maintained a good mood. She was clearly vain (and understandably so, given the beauty reflected in every mirror), but she wasn't artificial. She was generous with her money, free from any arrogance about her wealth, and genuinely honest. She was reasonably intelligent, cheerful, energetic, and tended to act without much forethought. In short, she was very captivating, even to a pragmatic observer of her own sex like me, but she wasn't someone with profound depth or lasting impact. Her way of thinking was quite different, for instance, from that of St. John's sisters. Nevertheless, I liked her almost as much as my student Adèle, although the bond developed with a child one has cared for and educated is naturally stronger than the affection one feels for an equally appealing adult acquaintance.\nShe took an immediate liking to me, a sort of pleasant whim. She remarked that I resembled Mr. Rivers, admitting, however, that I was certainly 'not even a tenth as handsome,' though 'a nice, neat little soul,' while he was 'an angel.' Still, she noted that I shared his positive qualities: I was good, intelligent, calm, and resolute. She declared me a 'lusus naturae' – a sort of natural oddity – for a village schoolmistress, confident that if my past were known, it would make a wonderful, romantic story.\nOne evening, displaying her usual childlike energy and her thoughtless yet not annoying curiosity, she began searching through my small kitchen's cupboard and table drawer. There, she first found two French books, a volume of Schiller, and a German grammar and dictionary. Then she discovered my art supplies and some sketches, which included a pencil drawing of a pretty, cherubic-looking little girl (one of my students) and various nature scenes drawn from the Morton Valley and the surrounding moorlands. Her reaction was initial astonishment, followed by sheer delight.\n'Did you do these pictures? Do you know French and German? What a darling – what a marvel you are!' she exclaimed. 'You draw better than my master in the top school in S—.' She then asked, 'Would you sketch a portrait of me to show Papa?'\n'With pleasure,' I responded, feeling an artist's thrill at the prospect of depicting such a perfect and radiant subject.

All about me was spotless and bright—scoured floor, polished grate, and well-rubbed chairs. I had also made myself neat, and had now the afternoon before me to spend as I would.\nThe translation of a few pages of German occupied an hour; then I got my palette and pencils, and fell to the more soothing, because easier occupation, of completing Rosamond Oliver’s miniature. The head was finished already: there was but the background to tint and the drapery to shade off; a touch of carmine, too, to add to the ripe lips—a soft curl here and there to the tresses—a deeper tinge to the shadow of the lash under the azured eyelid. I was absorbed in the execution of these nice details, when, after one rapid tap, my door unclosed, admitting St. John Rivers.\n“I am come to see how you are spending your holiday,” he said. “Not, I hope, in thought? No, that is well: while you draw you will not feel lonely. You see, I mistrust you still, though you have borne up wonderfully so far. I have brought you a book for evening solace,” and he laid on the table a new publication—a poem: one of those genuine productions so often vouchsafed to the fortunate public of those days—the golden age of modern literature. Alas! the readers of our era are less favoured. But courage! I will not pause either to accuse or repine. I know poetry is not dead, nor genius lost; nor has Mammon gained power over either, to bind or slay: they will both assert their existence, their presence, their liberty and strength again one day. Powerful angels, safe in heaven! they smile when sordid souls triumph, and feeble ones weep over their destruction. Poetry destroyed? Genius banished? No! Mediocrity, no: do not let envy prompt you to the thought. No; they not only live, but reign and redeem: and without their divine influence spread everywhere, you would be in hell—the hell of your own meanness.\nWhile I was eagerly glancing at the bright pages of “Marmion” (for “Marmion” it was), St. John stooped to examine my drawing. His tall figure sprang erect again with a start: he said nothing. I looked up at him: he shunned my eye. I knew his thoughts well, and could read his heart plainly; at the moment I felt calmer and cooler than he: I had then temporarily the advantage of him, and I conceived an inclination to do him some good, if I could.\n“With all his firmness and self-control,” thought I, “he tasks himself too far: locks every feeling and pang within—expresses, confesses, imparts nothing. I am sure it would benefit him to talk a little about this sweet Rosamond, whom he thinks he ought not to marry: I will make him talk.”\nI said first, “Take a chair, Mr. Rivers.” But he answered, as he always did, that he could not stay. “Very well,” I responded, mentally, “stand if you like; but you shall not go just yet, I am determined: solitude is at least as bad for you as it is for me. I’ll try if I cannot discover the secret spring of your confidence, and find an aperture in that marble breast through which I can shed one drop of the balm of sympathy.”\n“Is this portrait like?” I asked bluntly.\n“Like! Like whom? I did not observe it closely.”\n“You did, Mr. Rivers.”\nHe almost started at my sudden and strange abruptness: he looked at me astonished. “Oh, that is nothing yet,” I muttered within. “I don’t mean to be baffled by a little stiffness on your part; I’m prepared to go to considerable lengths.” I continued, “You observed it closely and distinctly; but I have no objection to your looking at it again,” and I rose and placed it in his hand.\n“A well-executed picture,” he said; “very soft, clear colouring; very graceful and correct drawing.”\n“Yes, yes; I know all that. But what of the resemblance? Who is it like?”\nMastering some hesitation, he answered, “Miss Oliver, I presume.”\n“Of course. And now, sir, to reward you for the accurate guess, I will promise to paint you a careful and faithful duplicate of this very picture, provided you admit that the gift would be acceptable to you. I don’t wish to throw away my time and trouble on an offering you would deem worthless.”\nHe continued to gaze at the picture: the longer he looked, the firmer he held it, the more he seemed to covet it. “It is like!” he murmured; “the eye is well managed: the colour, light, expression, are perfect. It smiles!”\n“Would it comfort, or would it wound you to have a similar painting? Tell me that. When you are at Madagascar, or at the Cape, or in India, would it be a consolation to have that memento in your possession? or would the sight of it bring recollections calculated to enervate and distress?”\nHe now furtively raised his eyes: he glanced at me, irresolute, disturbed: he again surveyed the picture.\n“That I should like to have it is certain: whether it would be judicious or wise is another question.”\nSince I had ascertained that Rosamond really preferred him, and that her father was not likely to oppose the match, I—less exalted in my views than St. John—had been strongly disposed in my own heart to advocate their union. It seemed to me that, should he become the possessor of Mr. Oliver’s large fortune, he might do as much good with it as if he went and laid his genius out to wither, and his strength to waste, under a tropical sun. With this persuasion I now answered—\n“As far as I can see, it would be wiser and more judicious if you were to take to yourself the original at once.”\n",
          "paraphrase_gemini-2.5-flash-preview-04-17": "It was the fifth of November, a day off. After assisting me with tidying up my cottage, my young helper left, pleased with the penny I gave her for her effort. Everything around me gleamed cleanly—the floor scrubbed, the fireplace polished, and the chairs well-cleaned. I had also neatened myself and had the entire afternoon ahead of me to use as I wished. Translating a few pages of German took about an hour; then I got out my art supplies, finding the task of finishing Rosamond Oliver’s miniature more relaxing because it was less difficult. The head was already done; only the background needed colour and the clothing needed shading. I added a touch of red to her full lips, a soft curl here and there to her hair, and a deeper shade to the shadow beneath the blue-tinted eyelid. I was completely focused on these delicate details when, after a quick knock, my door opened and St. John Rivers entered. He announced, “I’ve come to see how you are spending your holiday.” He added, “Not lost in thought, I hope? No, that’s good; as long as you are drawing, you won’t feel lonely. You see, I still have concerns about you, even though you’ve managed remarkably well so far. I’ve brought a book for you to enjoy this evening,” and he placed a recently published poem on the table. It was one of those exceptional works frequently granted to the fortunate public of that time—the peak era of modern writing. Sadly, readers today are not as lucky. But let’s be hopeful! I won’t stop to complain or find fault. I know poetry isn't dead, nor is genius lost; and money hasn't gained the power over them to suppress or destroy them. They will assert their existence, their presence, their freedom, and their strength again someday. Like powerful angels, safe in heaven, they smile when petty individuals succeed, and weaker ones despair over their decline. Poetry destroyed? Genius banished? Absolutely not! Mediocrity, no: don't let envy make you think that. They don't just survive; they rule and inspire, and without their divine influence spreading everywhere, you would be in a miserable state—the misery created by your own small-mindedness. As I eagerly looked at the shining pages of “Marmion” (for that was the book), St. John bent down to look at my painting. He suddenly stood up straight, startled, but said nothing. I glanced up at him; he avoided my gaze. I understood his feelings well and could clearly see into his heart. At that moment, I felt calmer and more composed than he did; I temporarily had the advantage, and I felt an urge to do him some good if possible. “Despite his willpower and self-control,” I thought, “he pushes himself too hard. He keeps every emotion and pain hidden—he reveals, admits, and shares nothing. I am certain it would benefit him to discuss this lovely Rosamond, whom he feels he should not marry. I will make him talk.” First, I offered, “Please take a seat, Mr. Rivers.” But he replied, as he always did, that he couldn’t stay. “Alright,” I thought to myself, “stand if you prefer, but you won’t leave just yet, I am decided. Solitude is at least as harmful for you as it is for me. I’ll try to find the hidden trigger of your openness and locate a way into that unyielding heart where I can offer a bit of comfort.” “Is this portrait a good likeness?” I asked directly. “Likeness! Like whom? I didn't look closely at it.” “Yes, you did, Mr. Rivers.” He was almost taken aback by my sudden, blunt way of speaking; he looked at me in surprise. “Oh, that’s nothing yet,” I mumbled inwardly. “I won’t be deterred by a little resistance from you; I am prepared to go quite far.” I continued, “You did observe it carefully and clearly, but I have no objection to you looking at it again,” and I got up and handed it to him. “It’s a skillfully done painting,” he commented, “with very soft, clear colours and very graceful and accurate drawing.” “Yes, yes, I know all that. But what about the resemblance? Who does it look like?” After some hesitation, he replied, “Miss Oliver, I presume.” “Naturally. And now, sir, to reward you for guessing correctly, I promise to paint you a careful and accurate copy of this very picture, provided you admit that you would be pleased to receive it. I don’t want to waste my time and effort on something you would consider worthless.” He continued to look at the picture; the longer he stared, the tighter he held it, the more he seemed to want it. “It is a good likeness!” he murmured, “the eye is skillfully rendered; the colour, light, and expression are flawless. It is smiling!” “Would possessing a similar painting comfort or pain you? Tell me that. When you are in Madagascar, or at the Cape, or in India, would having that reminder bring you solace? Or would seeing it bring back memories that would weaken and distress you?” He then subtly raised his eyes, glancing at me, appearing uncertain and troubled. He looked at the picture again. “That I would like to have it is clear; whether it would be sensible or wise is a different matter.” Since I had confirmed that Rosamond genuinely cared for him, and that her father was unlikely to object to their marriage, I—with less elevated goals than St. John—had felt strongly within my heart that they should be together. It seemed to me that if he were to inherit Mr. Oliver's substantial fortune, he could do just as much good with it as he could by going abroad and letting his talent wither and his strength be wasted under a tropical sun. With this belief, I now answered, “As far as I can see, it would be wiser and more sensible if you were to marry the original right away.”",
          "paraphrase_gpt-4.1-2025-04-14": "It was November 5th, a holiday, and after my young helper finished tidying my home for the small wage of a penny, she left satisfied. My surroundings were clean and shining—scrubbed floors, gleaming fireplace, and polished furniture. Having made myself presentable, I now had the afternoon free. I spent the next hour translating some German, then decided to shift to a more relaxing task: completing a miniature portrait of Rosamond Oliver. The face was done; I only needed to finish details like the background, her clothing, a slight flush to her lips, and some touches to her hair and eyelashes. As I focused intently on these details, a quick knock announced the arrival of St. John Rivers, who entered my room.\n\nHe explained he wanted to see how I was spending my holiday and was glad I was occupied with drawing and thus not feeling lonely. He admitted to still worrying about my wellbeing, even though I had shown resilience, and gave me a new book—a poem—to enjoy in the evening. He praised the literary era and reassured me that poetry and genius endure beyond material concerns, their influence vital to our lives.\n\nAs I eagerly looked at the poem, which was “Marmion,” St. John examined my drawing. He seemed startled, avoided my eyes, and though I sensed his emotions, I felt calmer than he did and wanted to help him if I could. I thought to myself that, despite his discipline and composure, he suppressed all his feelings and would benefit from talking, especially about Rosamond, whom he believed he shouldn’t marry. I resolved to encourage him to open up.\n\nI invited him to sit, but as usual, he said he couldn’t stay; internally, I was determined not to let him leave so easily. I wanted to find a way to gain his confidence and offer support. Bluntly, I asked him about the likeness of the portrait. Feigning disinterest, he reluctantly admitted it resembled Miss Oliver. I offered to paint him a copy of the portrait, on the condition that the gift would be welcome.\n\nHe looked at the painting longingly and admitted he would like to have it, though he wasn’t sure it would be wise. Having learned that Rosamond liked him and her father was unlikely to oppose their match, I felt—less idealistic than he was—that their marriage would be for the best. I believed he could do as much good in England with a fortune as he could abroad as a missionary. So I told him outright that he would be wiser to marry Rosamond herself."

          "text_segment": "By this time he had sat down: he had laid the picture on the table before him, and with his brow supported on both hands, hung fondly over it. I discerned he was now neither angry nor shocked at my audacity. I saw even that to be thus frankly addressed on a subject he had deemed unapproachable—to hear it thus freely handled—was beginning to be felt by him as a new pleasure—an unhoped-for relief. Reserved people often really need the frank discussion of their sentiments and griefs more than the expansive. The sternest-seeming stoic is human after all; and to “burst” with boldness and good-will into “the silent sea” of their souls is often to confer on them the first of obligations.\n“She likes you, I am sure,” said I, as I stood behind his chair, “and her father respects you. Moreover, she is a sweet girl—rather thoughtless; but you would have sufficient thought for both yourself and her. You ought to marry her.”\n“Does she like me?” he asked.\n“Certainly; better than she likes any one else. She talks of you continually: there is no subject she enjoys so much or touches upon so often.”\n“It is very pleasant to hear this,” he said—“very: go on for another quarter of an hour.” And he actually took out his watch and laid it upon the table to measure the time.\n“But where is the use of going on,” I asked, “when you are probably preparing some iron blow of contradiction, or forging a fresh chain to fetter your heart?”\n“Don’t imagine such hard things. Fancy me yielding and melting, as I am doing: human love rising like a freshly opened fountain in my mind and overflowing with sweet inundation all the field I have so carefully and with such labour prepared—so assiduously sown with the seeds of good intentions, of self-denying plans. And now it is deluged with a nectarous flood—the young germs swamped—delicious poison cankering them: now I see myself stretched on an ottoman in the drawing-room at Vale Hall at my bride Rosamond Oliver’s feet: she is talking to me with her sweet voice—gazing down on me with those eyes your skilful hand has copied so well—smiling at me with these coral lips. She is mine—I am hers—this present life and passing world suffice to me. Hush! say nothing—my heart is full of delight—my senses are entranced—let the time I marked pass in peace.”\nI humoured him: the watch ticked on: he breathed fast and low: I stood silent. Amidst this hush the quartet sped; he replaced the watch, laid the picture down, rose, and stood on the hearth.\n“Now,” said he, “that little space was given to delirium and delusion. I rested my temples on the breast of temptation, and put my neck voluntarily under her yoke of flowers; I tasted her cup. The pillow was burning: there is an asp in the garland: the wine has a bitter taste: her promises are hollow—her offers false: I see and know all this.”\nI gazed at him in wonder.\n“It is strange,” pursued he, “that while I love Rosamond Oliver so wildly—with all the intensity, indeed, of a first passion, the object of which is exquisitely beautiful, graceful, fascinating—I experience at the same time a calm, unwarped consciousness that she would not make me a good wife; that she is not the partner suited to me; that I should discover this within a year after marriage; and that to twelve months’ rapture would succeed a lifetime of regret. This I know.”\n“Strange indeed!” I could not help ejaculating.\n“While something in me,” he went on, “is acutely sensible to her charms, something else is as deeply impressed with her defects: they are such that she could sympathise in nothing I aspired to—co-operate in nothing I undertook. Rosamond a sufferer, a labourer, a female apostle? Rosamond a missionary’s wife? No!”\n“But you need not be a missionary. You might relinquish that scheme.”\n“Relinquish! What! my vocation? My great work? My foundation laid on earth for a mansion in heaven? My hopes of being numbered in the band who have merged all ambitions in the glorious one of bettering their race—of carrying knowledge into the realms of ignorance—of substituting peace for war—freedom for bondage—religion for superstition—the hope of heaven for the fear of hell? Must I relinquish that? It is dearer than the blood in my veins. It is what I have to look forward to, and to live for.”\nAfter a considerable pause, I said—“And Miss Oliver? Are her disappointment and sorrow of no interest to you?”\n“Miss Oliver is ever surrounded by suitors and flatterers: in less than a month, my image will be effaced from her heart. She will forget me; and will marry, probably, some one who will make her far happier than I should do.”\n“You speak coolly enough; but you suffer in the conflict. You are wasting away.”\n“No. If I get a little thin, it is with anxiety about my prospects, yet unsettled—my departure, continually procrastinated. Only this morning, I received intelligence that the successor, whose arrival I have been so long expecting, cannot be ready to replace me for three months to come yet; and perhaps the three months may extend to six.”\n“You tremble and become flushed whenever Miss Oliver enters the schoolroom.”\nAgain the surprised expression crossed his face. He had not imagined that a woman would dare to speak so to a man. For me, I felt at home in this sort of discourse. I could never rest in communication with strong, discreet, and refined minds, whether male or female, till I had passed the outworks of conventional reserve, and crossed the threshold of confidence, and won a place by their heart’s very hearthstone.\n“You are original,” said he, “and not timid. There is something brave in your spirit, as well as penetrating in your eye; but allow me to assure you that you partially misinterpret my emotions. You think them more profound and potent than they are. You give me a larger allowance of sympathy than I have a just claim to. When I colour, and when I shake before Miss Oliver, I do not pity myself. I scorn the weakness. I know it is ignoble: a mere fever of the flesh: not, I declare, the convulsion of the soul. That is just as fixed as a rock, firm set in the depths of a restless sea. Know me to be what I am—a cold hard man.”\nI smiled incredulously.\n“You have taken my confidence by storm,” he continued, “and now it is much at your service. I am simply, in my original state—stripped of that blood-bleached robe with which Christianity covers human deformity—a cold, hard, ambitious man. Natural affection only, of all the sentiments, has permanent power over me. Reason, and not feeling, is my guide; my ambition is unlimited: my desire to rise higher, to do more than others, insatiable. I honour endurance, perseverance, industry, talent; because these are the means by which men achieve great ends and mount to lofty eminence. I watch your career with interest, because I consider you a specimen of a diligent, orderly, energetic woman: not because I deeply compassionate what you have gone through, or what you still suffer.”\n“You would describe yourself as a mere pagan philosopher,” I said.\n“No. There is this difference between me and deistic philosophers: I believe; and I believe the Gospel. You missed your epithet. I am not a pagan, but a Christian philosopher—a follower of the sect of Jesus. As His disciple I adopt His pure, His merciful, His benignant doctrines. I advocate them: I am sworn to spread them. Won in youth to religion, she has cultivated my original qualities thus:—From the minute germ, natural affection, she has developed the overshadowing tree, philanthropy. From the wild stringy root of human uprightness, she has reared a due sense of the Divine justice. Of the ambition to win power and renown for my wretched self, she has formed the ambition to spread my Master’s kingdom; to achieve victories for the standard of the cross. So much has religion done for me; turning the original materials to the best account; pruning and training nature. But she could not eradicate nature: nor will it be eradicated ‘till this mortal shall put on immortality.’”\nHaving said this, he took his hat, which lay on the table beside my palette. Once more he looked at the portrait.\n“She is lovely,” he murmured. “She is well named the Rose of the World, indeed!”\n“And may I not paint one like it for you?”\n“Cui bono? No.”\nHe drew over the picture the sheet of thin paper on which I was accustomed to rest my hand in painting, to prevent the cardboard from being sullied. What he suddenly saw on this blank paper, it was impossible for me to tell; but something had caught his eye. He took it up with a snatch; he looked at the edge; then shot a glance at me, inexpressibly peculiar, and quite incomprehensible: a glance that seemed to take and make note of every point in my shape, face, and dress; for it traversed all, quick, keen as lightning. His lips parted, as if to speak: but he checked the coming sentence, whatever it was.\n“What is the matter?” I asked.\n“Nothing in the world,” was the reply; and, replacing the paper, I saw him dexterously tear a narrow slip from the margin. It disappeared in his glove; and, with one hasty nod and “good-afternoon,” he vanished.\n“Well!” I exclaimed, using an expression of the district, “that caps the globe, however!”\nI, in my turn, scrutinised the paper; but saw nothing on it save a few dingy stains of paint where I had tried the tint in my pencil. I pondered the mystery a minute or two; but finding it insolvable, and being certain it could not be of much moment, I dismissed, and soon forgot it.",
          "paraphrase_gemini-2.5-flash-preview-04-17": "By this time, he had taken a seat and placed the picture on the table in front of him, resting his forehead on both hands as he bent over it affectionately. I could tell he was no longer annoyed or surprised by my boldness. I even saw that being addressed so directly on a topic he considered inaccessible, and hearing it discussed with such freedom, was starting to feel like a new enjoyment—an unexpected source of relief. Reserved individuals often need open conversations about their feelings and troubles more than those who express themselves easily. Even the person who appears most stern is human beneath the surface, and boldly and kindly entering the 'silent sea' of their soul can frequently be the most valuable thing you can offer them.Standing behind his chair, I said, \"I am sure she is fond of you, and her father holds you in high esteem. Moreover, she is a delightful girl, though perhaps a little impractical; but you would have enough good sense for both of you. You really ought to marry her.\"\"Does she truly care for me?\" he inquired.\"Certainly, more than anyone else. She talks about you constantly; there is no subject she takes more pleasure in or brings up more often.\"\"It is very pleasant to hear this,\" he said, \"very pleasant indeed; continue speaking for another fifteen minutes.\" He actually took out his watch and set it on the table to keep track of the time.\"But what is the point of continuing,\" I asked, \"when you are probably preparing a harsh contradiction, or forging new emotional bonds to restrict your heart?\"\"Do not imagine such difficult things. Picture me yielding and softening, as I am now: human affection rising like a newly discovered spring in my mind and sweetly flooding the entire area I have so carefully and diligently prepared—so devotedly sown with the seeds of good intentions and self-sacrificing plans. And now it is saturated with a delightful flow, drowning the young growth, a lovely poison corrupting them: now I see myself reclined on an ottoman in the drawing-room at Vale Hall at the feet of my bride, Rosamond Oliver: she is speaking to me in her sweet voice, looking down at me with those eyes your skilled hand has depicted so accurately, smiling at me with those coral lips. She is mine—I am hers—this current existence and fleeting world are enough for me. Quiet! Say nothing—my heart is overflowing with joy—my senses are enchanted—let the time I have set pass in peace.\"I indulged him; the watch continued to tick; he breathed quickly and softly; I stood silently. Amidst this quiet, the fifteen minutes passed quickly; he replaced the watch, put the picture down, rose, and stood by the fireplace.\"Now,\" he said, \"that brief interval was given over to fantasy and self-deception. I rested my head on the breast of temptation, and willingly placed my neck under its beautiful but confining yoke; I tasted its pleasure. The comfort felt scorching; there is a hidden danger within the attraction; the delight has a bitter taste; her promises are empty—her offers false: I see and understand all of this.\"I stared at him in astonishment.\"It is strange,\" he continued, \"that while I love Rosamond Oliver so intensely—indeed, with all the passion of a first love for someone incredibly beautiful, graceful, and captivating—I simultaneously possess a calm, clear awareness that she would not make me a suitable wife; that she is not the partner meant for me; that I would realise this within a year after marrying; and that twelve months of rapture would be followed by a lifetime of regret. I know this.\"\"Truly strange!\" I could not help exclaiming.\"While one part of me,\" he went on, \"is acutely sensitive to her charms, another part is just as deeply aware of her flaws: they are such that she could not sympathise with anything I aspired to, nor cooperate in anything I undertook. Rosamond enduring suffering, working hard, being a female missionary? Rosamond as a missionary’s wife? Impossible!\"\"But you are not required to be a missionary. You could abandon that project.\"\"Abandon! What! My calling? My crucial work? My foundation laid on earth for a dwelling in heaven? My hopes of being counted among those who have merged all personal ambitions into the glorious one of improving their fellow humans—of bringing knowledge to regions of ignorance—of replacing conflict with peace—slavery with freedom—superstition with religion—the hope of heaven with the fear of hell? Must I give that up? It is more precious than the blood that runs through my veins. It is what I anticipate, and what I live for.\"After a considerable pause, I said, \"And Miss Oliver? Are her disappointment and sorrow of no importance to you?\"\"Miss Oliver is constantly surrounded by admirers and flatterers: in less than a month, my image will be erased from her heart. She will forget me, and will likely marry someone who will make her much happier than I ever could.\"\"You speak quite calmly; but you are suffering in this struggle. You are looking quite thin.\"\"No. If I am a little thinner, it is from anxiety about my future plans, which are still unsettled—my departure, which is continually put off. Just this morning, I received news that the person meant to replace me, whose arrival I have been expecting for so long, will not be ready to take my place for another three months; and perhaps those three months might extend to six.\"\"You tremble and your face flushes whenever Miss Oliver enters the schoolroom.\"Again, the look of surprise appeared on his face. He had not imagined that a woman would dare to speak so directly to a man. As for me, I felt entirely comfortable in this kind of conversation. With intelligent, sensible, and refined individuals, male or female, I could never feel truly connected until I had broken through the barriers of conventional reserve, crossed the threshold of confidence, and secured a place close to their innermost selves.\"You are unique,\" he said, \"and not timid. There is a bravery in your spirit, as well as keenness in your gaze; but allow me to assure you that you are partly misinterpreting my feelings. You believe them to be more profound and powerful than they are. You attribute more sympathy to me than I rightly deserve. When I flush and when I tremble before Miss Oliver, I do not feel pity for myself. I despise that weakness. I know it is ignoble: merely a physical reaction, not, I declare, a disturbance of the soul. My soul is as steadfast as a rock, firmly rooted in the depths of a restless sea. Understand me for what I am—a cold, hard man.\"I smiled disbelievingly.\"You have taken my confidence by storm,\" he continued, \"and now you have it at your disposal. I am simply, in my true nature—stripped of the purifying influence with which Christianity covers human imperfection—a cold, hard, ambitious man. Only natural affection, of all the emotions, has lasting power over me. Reason, and not emotion, is my guide; my ambition is boundless; my desire to achieve more, to do greater things than others, is insatiable. I value endurance, perseverance, diligence, and talent, because these are the means by which people achieve great results and reach high positions. I observe your progress with interest because I consider you an example of a hardworking, disciplined, and energetic woman: not because I feel deep compassion for what you have experienced, or what you are still enduring.\"\"You would describe yourself as simply a pagan philosopher,\" I said.\"No. There is this distinction between me and deistic philosophers: I believe, and I believe the Gospel. You missed the correct description. I am not a pagan, but a Christian philosopher—a follower of Jesus's teachings. As His disciple, I embrace His pure, merciful, benevolent doctrines. I champion them; I am dedicated to spreading them. Converted to religion in youth, it has cultivated my original qualities in this way: From the tiny seed of natural affection, it has grown the expansive tree of philanthropy. From the rough, fundamental core of human integrity, it has developed a proper awareness of Divine justice. The ambition to gain power and recognition for my insignificant self, it has transformed into the ambition to spread my Master’s kingdom, to achieve victories for the cause of the cross. This is the extent of religion's influence on me; making the best use of my inherent traits, refining and guiding my nature. But it could not eliminate nature itself, nor will it be eliminated 'until this mortal shall put on immortality.'\"Having said this, he picked up his hat, which was on the table beside my painting palette. Once more, he looked at the portrait.\"She is lovely,\" he murmured. \"She is truly well-named the Rose of the World!\"\"And may I not paint one just like it for you?\"\"To what end? No.\"He drew the thin sheet of paper I typically used to rest my hand on while painting, to keep the cardboard clean, over the picture. What he suddenly saw on this blank paper, it was impossible for me to determine; but something had caught his eye. He snatched it up; he examined the edge; then shot a glance at me that was incredibly peculiar and utterly baffling: a glance that seemed to quickly and sharply take note of every detail of my figure, face, and dress, as it scanned everything rapidly. His lips parted, as if to speak; but he stopped the words that were about to come out, whatever they were.\"What is the matter?\" I asked.\"Nothing at all,\" was the reply; and, replacing the paper, I saw him skillfully tear a narrow strip from the edge. It disappeared into his glove, and with a quick nod and a \"good-afternoon,\" he left. \"Well!\" I exclaimed, using a local expression, \"that certainly takes the cake!\"I, in turn, examined the paper carefully, but saw nothing on it except a few faint paint stains where I had tested colours for my brush. I thought about the mystery for a minute or two, but finding it impossible to solve and being certain it could not be very important, I dismissed it and soon forgot about it.",
          "paraphrase_gpt-4.1-2025-04-14": "At this point, he had taken a seat and placed the portrait in front of him, resting his forehead in his hands as he gazed at it fondly. I noticed he was no longer upset or disturbed by my boldness. In fact, being approached so directly on a topic he had considered off-limits seemed to give him an unexpected sense of relief and pleasure. People who are reserved often crave open conversation about their feelings and troubles more than those who are naturally expressive. Even those who appear most stoic are human at heart, and bold, considerate conversation can provide them with invaluable comfort.\n\nI told him, as I stood behind, that I was sure Miss Oliver liked him, that her father respected him, and she was a charming, if somewhat thoughtless, girl—but he would think enough for both of them, and so he should marry her. He asked if she truly liked him. I assured him she did, more than anyone else; she spoke of him often and with much enjoyment.\n\nHe expressed delight at this and even set his watch on the table, asking me to continue talking for another fifteen minutes. I questioned the point of continuing if he was just planning to rebuff my words or harden his own heart further.\n\nHe urged me not to suspect such harshness and asked me to imagine him softening, allowing himself to feel love—letting these feelings wash over everything he had carefully cultivated. He described imagining himself reclining at Vale Hall with Rosamond Oliver, his bride, at his side, fully content with this life. He wished for silence and to enjoy these feelings a while, and so I indulged him. Time passed quietly, until he got up and declared that he had allowed himself a brief fantasy, indulging in temptation. But he saw the dangers: the beauty hid pain, and the delight was fleeting and false. He realized this.\n\nI was surprised. He explained that even though his feelings for Rosamond Oliver were strong and full of passion, he also clearly understood that she would not make him a suitable wife; her personality was such that she could not share or support his values and aspirations. He knew that after a brief period of happiness, long-term regret would follow.\n\nI said this was strange, but he continued, acknowledging her attractions but also her incompatibility with his life. She could never be a sufferer, worker, or missionary’s wife.\n\nI suggested he didn’t have to be a missionary, but he dismissed the idea, refusing to abandon his life’s purpose—his religious mission, which he valued above everything else, aiming to spread knowledge, peace, and faith.\n\nAfter a pause, I asked if Miss Oliver’s heartbreak meant nothing to him. He replied that she was always surrounded by admirers and would soon move on, likely finding greater happiness with someone else.\n\nI pointed out that he was clearly affected by the situation, but he claimed his worries were for his uncertain future, not love—delays in his plans weighed on him. When I mentioned his nervousness around Miss Oliver, he was startled that I would speak so directly, but I explained that I was comfortable discussing such things with people I respected.\n\nHe commented on my boldness and insight but insisted I misunderstood the depth of his emotions, claiming his affection was fleeting and his mind remained steadfast. He described himself as cold, hard, and led by reason rather than feeling, ambitious for achievement, and only truly moved by natural affection, not suffering.\n\nI suggested he was like a pagan philosopher, but he corrected me, asserting that he was a Christian philosopher, motivated by faith and philanthropy. His religion had shaped his ambitions for a greater good beyond himself, but it had not and could not erase his true nature.\n\nAs he prepared to leave, he admired the portrait again, calling Rosamond the ‘Rose of the World.’ I offered to paint another picture for him, but he declined. While putting away the painting, he noticed something on a sheet of paper, examined it carefully with an intense look at me, but eventually dismissed it. I asked if anything was wrong, but he insisted there was not and, after tearing off a strip of the paper and hiding it, quickly took his leave. I checked the paper myself but found only paint stains, and after briefly wondering about the mystery, I decided it was unimportant and forgot about it."

The next day a keen wind brought fresh and blinding falls; by twilight the valley was drifted up and almost impassable. I had closed my shutter, laid a mat to the door to prevent the snow from blowing in under it, trimmed my fire, and after sitting nearly an hour on the hearth listening to the muffled fury of the tempest, I lit a candle, took down “Marmion,” and beginning—\n“Day set on Norham’s castled steep,\nAnd Tweed’s fair river broad and deep,\n    And Cheviot’s mountains lone;\nThe massive towers, the donjon keep,\nThe flanking walls that round them sweep,\n    In yellow lustre shone”—\nI soon forgot storm in music.\nI heard a noise: the wind, I thought, shook the door. No; it was St. John Rivers, who, lifting the latch, came in out of the frozen hurricane—the howling darkness—and stood before me: the cloak that covered his tall figure all white as a glacier. I was almost in consternation, so little had I expected any guest from the blocked-up vale that night.\n“Any ill news?” I demanded. “Has anything happened?”\n“No. How very easily alarmed you are!” he answered, removing his cloak and hanging it up against the door, towards which he again coolly pushed the mat which his entrance had deranged. He stamped the snow from his boots.\n“I shall sully the purity of your floor,” said he, “but you must excuse me for once.” Then he approached the fire. “I have had hard work to get here, I assure you,” he observed, as he warmed his hands over the flame. “One drift took me up to the waist; happily the snow is quite soft yet.”\n“But why are you come?” I could not forbear saying.\n“Rather an inhospitable question to put to a visitor; but since you ask it, I answer simply to have a little talk with you; I got tired of my mute books and empty rooms. Besides, since yesterday I have experienced the excitement of a person to whom a tale has been half-told, and who is impatient to hear the sequel.”\nHe sat down. I recalled his singular conduct of yesterday, and really I began to fear his wits were touched. If he were insane, however, his was a very cool and collected insanity: I had never seen that handsome-featured face of his look more like chiselled marble than it did just now, as he put aside his snow-wet hair from his forehead and let the firelight shine free on his pale brow and cheek as pale, where it grieved me to discover the hollow trace of care or sorrow now so plainly graved. I waited, expecting he would say something I could at least comprehend; but his hand was now at his chin, his finger on his lip: he was thinking. It struck me that his hand looked wasted like his face. A perhaps uncalled-for gush of pity came over my heart: I was moved to say—\n“I wish Diana or Mary would come and live with you: it is too bad that you should be quite alone; and you are recklessly rash about your own health.”\n“Not at all,” said he: “I care for myself when necessary. I am well now. What do you see amiss in me?”\nThis was said with a careless, abstracted indifference, which showed that my solicitude was, at least in his opinion, wholly superfluous. I was silenced.",
          "paraphrase_gemini-2.5-flash-preview-04-17": "After Mr. St. John left, it began to snow, and the fierce storm lasted all night. The following day, a sharp wind brought heavy, blinding snowfalls; by dusk, the valley was completely drifted over and nearly impassable. I had closed my shutters, put a mat at the door to stop snow from blowing underneath, built up my fire, and after sitting by the hearth for almost an hour listening to the muffled roar of the tempest, I lit a candle, took down “Marmion,” and as I started reading the opening lines about a castle, I soon forgot the storm in the music of the poetry. I heard a sound; I thought it was the wind shaking the door. No; it was St. John Rivers, who lifted the latch and came in out of the freezing blizzard—the dark, howling wind—and stood before me. The cloak covering his tall frame was entirely white like a glacier. I was almost shocked, as I had so little expected any guest from the snowbound valley that night. “Any bad news?” I asked. “Has something happened?” “No. You are easily startled!” he replied, taking off his cloak and hanging it by the door, towards which he calmly pushed the mat back into place after his entry had displaced it. He stamped the snow off his boots. “I’m going to mark your clean floor,” he said, “but you must excuse me this one time.” He then approached the fire. “It was hard work getting here, I assure you,” he remarked, warming his hands over the flames. “One drift came up to my waist; thankfully, the snow is still quite soft.” “But why did you come?” I couldn’t help but ask. “Rather an unwelcoming question to ask a visitor; but since you ask, I simply came to have a little conversation with you. I got tired of my silent books and empty rooms. Besides, since yesterday, I’ve had the feeling of someone to whom a story has been only half-told, and who is eager to hear the rest.” He sat down. I remembered his peculiar behavior the previous day, and I began to worry that he might be losing his mind. However, if he was mad, his was a very controlled and calm form of madness. I had never seen his handsome face look more like sculpted marble than it did just then, as he pushed his snow-damp hair off his forehead and let the firelight shine on his pale brow and equally pale cheek, where I was saddened to notice the deep imprint of worry or sorrow now clearly etched. I waited, expecting him to say something I could at least understand, but his hand was on his chin, his finger on his lip; he was thinking. It struck me that his hand looked as thin as his face. A perhaps unasked-for wave of pity came over me, moving me to say, “I wish Diana or Mary would come and live with you. It’s too bad you have to be completely alone, and you are dangerously careless about your own health.” “Not at all,” he said. “I take care of myself when necessary. I am well now. What fault do you see in me?” He said this with a distant, indifferent air that showed my concern was, in his opinion at least, entirely unnecessary. I was silenced.",
          "paraphrase_gpt-4.1-2025-04-14": "As Mr. St. John left, snow had just begun to fall, and the storm continued fiercely through the night. The following day was also bitterly cold, with strong winds causing more heavy and blinding snowfalls. By dusk, the valley was so filled with snowdrifts that it was nearly impossible to travel. I shut the shutters, placed a mat by the door to keep out the snow, tended to the fire, and, after spending almost an hour by the hearth listening to the muffled rage of the storm, I lit a candle and took down a copy of \"Marmion.\" As I read its vivid verses, I soon became absorbed and forgot about the storm outside. Suddenly, I heard a sound, thinking it was the wind rattling the door, but it was actually St. John Rivers entering from the blizzard, nearly white from the snow. His unexpected arrival startled me, since travel seemed impossible that night. I immediately asked if anything was wrong, but he reassured me that all was well and teased me for being so easily alarmed. He hung up his snowy cloak, brushed his boots, and apologized for the mess. Warming himself by the fire, he remarked how difficult his journey had been, with one snowdrift reaching his waist, though the snow was still soft. I couldn't help but ask why he had come. He replied that although my question was not very welcoming, he simply wanted some company after getting bored with his books and empty rooms, and also felt restless after hearing only half of a story the previous day. As he sat, I remembered his odd behavior before and began to worry about his state of mind, though he appeared calm and composed. The firelight revealed the signs of care or worry on his pale face, making me feel sorry for him. I wished aloud that his sisters would come live with him, since solitude and recklessness were taking a toll on his health. He simply replied that he took care of himself when needed and asked what seemed wrong with him, in a manner that made it clear he thought my concern was unnecessary, and I said nothing more."

He simply pulled out a small leather pocket-book, extracted a letter from it, read it silently, folded it, replaced it, and sank back into thought.

You won't be called upon to leave England earlier than you anticipated?\" \"I fear not, unfortunately; such a fortunate turn of events is too good to happen to me.\" Defeated on that topic, I shifted the conversation.

I asked if his plans to leave England had changed, or if he might go earlier than expected. He said regretfully that seemed unlikely. Changing the subject, I started talking about the school and my students: Mary Garrett’s mother was feeling better so Mary returned that morning, and four new girls would start next week, delayed that day by snow. He responded with brief interest. I added that Mr. Oliver was paying for two of them. He confirmed, and I said Mr. Oliver intended to give the entire school a treat at Christmas.

Before commencing, it is but fair to warn you that the story will sound somewhat hackneyed in your ears; but stale details often regain a degree of freshness when they pass through new lips. For the rest, whether trite or novel, it is short.\n“Twenty years ago, a poor curate—never mind his name at this moment—fell in love with a rich man’s daughter; she fell in love with him, and married him, against the advice of all her friends, who consequently disowned her immediately after the wedding. Before two years passed, the rash pair were both dead, and laid quietly side by side under one slab. (I have seen their grave; it formed part of the pavement of a huge churchyard surrounding the grim, soot-black old cathedral of an overgrown manufacturing town in ——shire.) They left a daughter, which, at its very birth, Charity received in her lap—cold as that of the snow-drift I almost stuck fast in to-night. Charity carried the friendless thing to the house of its rich maternal relations; it was reared by an aunt-in-law, called (I come to names now) Mrs. Reed of Gateshead. You start—did you hear a noise? I daresay it is only a rat scrambling along the rafters of the adjoining schoolroom: it was a barn before I had it repaired and altered, and barns are generally haunted by rats.—To proceed. Mrs. Reed kept the orphan ten years: whether it was happy or not with her, I cannot say, never having been told; but at the end of that time she transferred it to a place you know—being no other than Lowood School, where you so long resided yourself. It seems her career there was very honourable: from a pupil, she became a teacher, like yourself—really it strikes me there are parallel points in her history and yours—she left it to be a governess: there, again, your fates were analogous; she undertook the education of the ward of a certain Mr. Rochester.”\n“Mr. Rivers!” I interrupted.\n“I can guess your feelings,” he said, “but restrain them for a while: I have nearly finished; hear me to the end. Of Mr. Rochester’s character I know nothing, but the one fact that he professed to offer honourable marriage to this young girl, and that at the very altar she discovered he had a wife yet alive, though a lunatic. What his subsequent conduct and proposals were is a matter of pure conjecture; but when an event transpired which rendered inquiry after the governess necessary, it was discovered she was gone—no one could tell when, where, or how. She had left Thornfield Hall in the night; every research after her course had been vain: the country had been scoured far and wide; no vestige of information could be gathered respecting her. Yet that she should be found is become a matter of serious urgency: advertisements have been put in all the papers; I myself have received a letter from one Mr. Briggs, a solicitor, communicating the details I have just imparted. Is it not an odd tale?”",
          "paraphrase_gemini-2.5-flash-preview-04-17": "The text caused him to stir; he uncrossed his legs, sat up straight, and faced me. He instructed, \"Put down your book for a moment, and come closer to the fire.\" Puzzled, and my bewilderment having no limit, I obeyed. \"About thirty minutes ago,\" he continued, \"I mentioned how eager I was to hear the next part of a story; upon reflection, I think it will be better if I become the storyteller and you become the listener. Before I begin, it's only fair to let you know the account might sound somewhat familiar to you, but old details often gain a certain freshness when narrated by someone new. As for the rest, whether it's common or unusual, it's brief. \"Two decades ago, a humble curate—his name isn't important right now—fell in love with the daughter of a wealthy man. She reciprocated his feelings and married him, going against the advice of all her friends, who consequently renounced her right after the wedding. Less than two years later, the impulsive couple were both dead and peacefully buried side by side under a single gravestone. (I have seen their grave; it was part of the paving stones in a huge churchyard surrounding the somber, black-sooted old cathedral of an overly large industrial town in ——shire.) They left behind a daughter, who, from the very moment of her birth, was taken in by Charity—as cold as the snowdrift I nearly got stuck in tonight. Charity brought the abandoned infant to the home of her rich relatives on her mother's side. She was raised by an aunt-in-law, named (now I will use names) Mrs. Reed of Gateshead. You flinch—did you hear something? I expect it's just a rat scurrying along the beams in the adjacent schoolroom. It used to be a barn before I had it renovated, and barns are typically frequented by rats. To resume. Mrs. Reed kept the orphan for ten years. Whether she was content with her, I cannot say, as I was never informed; but at the end of that period, she transferred her to a place you are familiar with—none other than Lowood School, where you yourself lived for so long. It appears her time there was quite commendable: she progressed from a student to a teacher, just like you—it really does strike me how similar her history is to yours. She left Lowood to become a governess. There, again, your destinies were parallel. She took on the task of educating the ward of a certain Mr. Rochester.\" \"Mr. Rivers!\" I interjected. \"I can understand your reaction,\" he said, \"but please hold back for a moment; I am almost done. Hear me out. About Mr. Rochester's character, I know nothing, except for the single fact that he claimed he intended to marry this young woman honourably, and that at the very marriage ceremony, she found out he already had a living wife, although she was mentally ill. What his subsequent actions and proposals were is purely speculative. But when something occurred that made it necessary to look for the governess, it was found she was gone—nobody could say when, where, or how. She had departed Thornfield Hall during the night. All efforts to trace her path had failed. The countryside had been searched extensively, but no trace of information about her could be found. However, finding her has now become a matter of serious importance. Advertisements have been placed in all the newspapers, and I myself have received a letter from a solicitor named Mr. Briggs, who conveyed the details I have just shared. Isn't it a peculiar story?\"",
          "paraphrase_gpt-4.1-2025-04-14": "The account piqued his interest; he straightened up, faced me, and said, \"Put your book aside for a moment and come closer to the fire.\" Still curious and unable to guess his intent, I did as he asked. He continued, saying, \"Earlier, I mentioned wanting to hear how a story concluded. Having thought it over, I see it makes more sense for me to take over as storyteller, with you listening. Before I start, let me mention that the plot may seem overly familiar, but sometimes old tales sound new when told by new voices. Regardless, the story is brief—familiar or not. \"Two decades ago, a poor clergyman—let’s leave his name out for now—fell for a wealthy man's daughter. She reciprocated his feelings, and married him, disregarding the disapproval of her family, who then cut her off after the wedding. Less than two years later, both died and were buried together beneath one gravestone, which I have seen in the churchyard of an old, grim cathedral in an industrial town in ——shire. Their newborn daughter was immediately taken in by charitable hands—hands cold as the snow I nearly got stuck in this evening. This child was brought to her rich relatives on her mother's side, and raised by an aunt by marriage, known as Mrs. Reed of Gateshead. You seem surprised—did you hear something? Probably just a rat in the schoolroom’s rafters; it used to be a barn, and barns do attract rats. Anyway, Mrs. Reed kept the orphan for ten years: I don’t know if she was happy there, as I was never told. After those ten years, Mrs. Reed sent her to Lowood School, where you yourself stayed for so long. She apparently did well there—after being a student, she became a teacher, just as you did. There are similarities between her life and yours: she left to become a governess, just like you, and she was in charge of the ward of Mr. Rochester.\" I broke in, \"Mr. Rivers!\" He replied, \"I can imagine your reaction, but please wait: I’m almost finished, so let me continue. I don’t know much about Mr. Rochester, except that he proposed an honest marriage to this young woman. But right at the altar, she learned he still had a living wife—albeit mentally ill. After that, I don’t know what happened between them. But when an event made it necessary to look for the governess, it turned out she had vanished—no one knew when, how, or where she had gone. She left Thornfield Hall one night, and all searches for her were fruitless; nobody could find any trace. Yet her discovery has become very important: advertisements have been posted everywhere, and I even received a letter from a solicitor, Mr. Briggs, sharing these details. Isn’t it a strange story?”"

Is he well?”\n“I am ignorant of all concerning Mr. Rochester: the letter never mentions him but to narrate the fraudulent and illegal attempt I have adverted to. You should rather ask the name of the governess—the nature of the event which requires her appearance.”\n“Did no one go to Thornfield Hall, then? Did no one see Mr. Rochester?”\n“I suppose not.”\n“But they wrote to him?”\n“Of course.”\n“And what did he say? Who has his letters?”\n“Mr. Briggs intimates that the answer to his application was not from Mr. Rochester, but from a lady: it is signed ‘Alice Fairfax.’”\nI felt cold and dismayed: my worst fears then were probably true: he had in all probability left England and rushed in reckless desperation to some former haunt on the Continent. And what opiate for his severe sufferings—what object for his strong passions—had he sought there? I dared not answer the question. Oh, my poor master—once almost my husband—whom I had often called “my dear Edward!”\n“He must have been a bad man,” observed Mr. Rivers.\n“You don’t know him—don’t pronounce an opinion upon him,” I said, with warmth.\n“Very well,” he answered quietly: “and indeed my head is otherwise occupied than with him: I have my tale to finish. Since you won’t ask the governess’s name, I must tell it of my own accord. Stay! I have it here—it is always more satisfactory to see important points written down, fairly committed to black and white.”\nAnd the pocket-book was again deliberately produced, opened, sought through; from one of its compartments was extracted a shabby slip of paper, hastily torn off: I recognised in its texture and its stains of ultra-marine, and lake, and vermillion, the ravished margin of the portrait-cover. He got up, held it close to my eyes: and I read, traced in Indian ink, in my own handwriting, the words “JANE EYRE”—the work doubtless of some moment of abstraction.\n“Briggs wrote to me of a Jane Eyre:” he said, “the advertisements demanded a Jane Eyre: I knew a Jane Elliott.—I confess I had my suspicions, but it was only yesterday afternoon they were at once resolved into certainty. You own the name and renounce the alias?”\n“Yes—yes; but where is Mr. Briggs? He perhaps knows more of Mr. Rochester than you do.”\n“Briggs is in London. I should doubt his knowing anything at all about Mr. Rochester; it is not in Mr. Rochester he is interested. Meantime, you forget essential points in pursuing trifles: you do not inquire why Mr. Briggs sought after you—what he wanted with you.”\n“Well, what did he want?”\n“Merely to tell you that your uncle, Mr. Eyre of Madeira, is dead; that he has left you all his property, and that you are now rich—merely that—nothing more.”\n“I!—rich?”\n“Yes, you, rich—quite an heiress.”\nSilence succeeded.\n“You must prove your identity of course,” resumed St. John presently: “a step which will offer no difficulties; you can then enter on immediate possession. Your fortune is vested in the English funds; Briggs has the will and the necessary documents.”\nHere was a new card turned up! It is a fine thing, reader, to be lifted in a moment from indigence to wealth—a very fine thing; but not a matter one can comprehend, or consequently enjoy, all at once. And then there are other chances in life far more thrilling and rapture-giving: this is solid, an affair of the actual world, nothing ideal about it: all its associations are solid and sober, and its manifestations are the same. One does not jump, and spring, and shout hurrah! at hearing one has got a fortune; one begins to consider responsibilities, and to ponder business; on a base of steady satisfaction rise certain grave cares, and we contain ourselves, and brood over our bliss with a solemn brow.\nBesides, the words Legacy, Bequest, go side by side with the words, Death, Funeral. My uncle I had heard was dead—my only relative; ever since being made aware of his existence, I had cherished the hope of one day seeing him: now, I never should. And then this money came only to me: not to me and a rejoicing family, but to my isolated self. It was a grand boon doubtless; and independence would be glorious—yes, I felt that—that thought swelled my heart.\n“You unbend your forehead at last,” said Mr. Rivers. “I thought Medusa had looked at you, and that you were turning to stone. Perhaps now you will ask how much you are worth?”\n“How much am I worth?”\n“Oh, a trifle! Nothing of course to speak of—twenty thousand pounds, I think they say—but what is that?”\n“Twenty thousand pounds?”",
          "paraphrase_gemini-2.5-flash-preview-04-17": "“Tell me this, please,” I insisted, “and since you’re so well-informed, you must surely know – what has become of Mr. Rochester? How is he, and where is he? What is he doing? Is he healthy?”\n“I am completely unaware of anything regarding Mr. Rochester,” he responded. “The letter never mentions him except to describe the deceitful and unlawful attempt I referred to. You should rather inquire about the name of the governess – the reason the situation requires her presence.”\n“So, did no one visit Thornfield Hall, then? Did no one see Mr. Rochester?”\n“I presume not.”\n“But they did correspond with him?”\n“Naturally.”\n“And what was his response? Who possesses his letters?”\n“Mr. Briggs indicates that the reply to his communication was not from Mr. Rochester, but from a woman; it’s signed ‘Alice Fairfax.’”\nA chill went through me, and I felt disheartened; my worst anxieties were likely true. He had most likely left England and rushed in desperate abandon to some former retreat on the Continent. And what solace for his profound suffering – what aim for his intense passions – had he pursued there? I did not dare to consider the answer. Oh, my poor master – who was once nearly my husband – whom I had so often affectionately called “my dear Edward!”\n“He must have been a wicked individual,” Mr. Rivers remarked.\n“You don’t know him – don’t make a judgment about him,” I said, with feeling.\n“Very well,” he answered calmly; “and truly my thoughts are occupied with other matters than him. I have my story to conclude. Since you won’t ask for the governess’s name, I must provide it myself. Wait! I have it right here – it’s always more reassuring to see crucial information in writing, clearly put down in black and white.”\nAnd the pocket-book was deliberately produced again, opened, and searched through; from one of its sections, he extracted a small, worn piece of paper, hastily torn off. I recognized its texture and the smudges of ultramarine, lake, and vermillion as coming from the ruined edge of the portrait cover. He stood up, held it close to my eyes, and I read, inscribed in Indian ink, in my own hand, the words “JANE EYRE” – likely the result of some moment of absent-mindedness.\n“Briggs wrote to me concerning a Jane Eyre,” he said. “The advertisements sought a Jane Eyre. I knew a Jane Elliott. I admit I had my suspicions, but only yesterday afternoon were they definitively confirmed. Do you acknowledge this name and abandon the pretense?”\n“Yes – yes; but where is Mr. Briggs? He might know more about Mr. Rochester than you do.”\n“Briggs is in London. I doubt he knows anything whatsoever about Mr. Rochester; his interest is not in Mr. Rochester. Meanwhile, you are neglecting essential matters by focusing on trivial details: you are not inquiring why Mr. Briggs was searching for you – what he needed you for.”\n“Well, what did he want?”\n“Merely to inform you that your uncle, Mr. Eyre of Madeira, is deceased; that he has left you all his assets, and that you are now wealthy – simply that – nothing further.”\n“I! – wealthy?”\n“Yes, you, wealthy – quite an heiress.”\nA period of silence ensued.\n“You must provide proof of your identity, of course,” St. John resumed presently; “a step which will present no difficulties; you can then take immediate control. Your fortune is invested in government securities; Briggs possesses the will and the necessary documents.”\nHere was a completely unexpected development! It is a significant event, dear reader, to be instantly raised from poverty to riches – a very important thing; but not something one can fully grasp, or consequently, instantly relish. And then there are other experiences in life far more emotionally stirring and joy-inducing; this is concrete, a matter of the practical world, devoid of any idealistic qualities. All its connections are solid and sober, and its effects are the same. One does not leap, and bound, and cheer 'hurrah!' upon hearing they have acquired a fortune; one begins to consider responsibilities, and to ponder financial affairs; upon a foundation of steady satisfaction arise certain serious concerns, and we maintain our composure, and contemplate our good fortune with a serious expression.\nBesides, the terms Legacy, Bequest, are associated with Death, Funeral. I had heard my uncle was dead – my only relative; ever since I became aware of his existence, I had held onto the hope of meeting him one day; now, I never would. And then this money came solely to me: not to me and a rejoicing family, but to my solitary self. It was undoubtedly a great blessing; and independence would be glorious – yes, I felt that – that thought expanded my heart.\n“You are finally relaxing your brow,” Mr. Rivers observed. “I thought Medusa had looked upon you, and that you were turning to stone. Perhaps now you will ask how much your worth is?”\n“How much am I worth?”\n“Oh, a trivial amount! Nothing significant, of course – twenty thousand pounds, I believe they state – but what does that matter?”\n“Twenty thousand pounds?”",
          "paraphrase_gpt-4.1-2025-04-14": "\"Just tell me this,\" I asked, \"and given all you know, surely you can—what about Mr. Rochester? Where is he, what is he doing, is he well?\" \n\"I know nothing about Mr. Rochester. The letter only refers to him as part of describing the false and illegal action I already mentioned. Instead, you should be asking about the governess and why she needs to appear.\"\n\"So no one went to Thornfield Hall? No one saw Mr. Rochester?\"\n\"I assume not.\"\n\"But they wrote to him?\"\n\"Yes.\"\n\"And what did he reply? Where are his letters?\"\n\"Mr. Briggs says that the response wasn’t from Mr. Rochester himself, but from a woman—it’s signed ‘Alice Fairfax.’\"\nI was struck by a chill and fear; it seemed my worst suspicions were likely true—that Mr. Rochester had probably left England and, in desperation, gone back to old haunts on the continent. What did he seek there to help his suffering or occupy his passionate nature? I didn’t dare guess. My poor master—almost my husband—whom I’d often called my dear Edward!\n\n\"He must have been a bad man,\" Mr. Rivers said.\n\"You don’t know him, so don’t judge him,\" I replied passionately.\n\"All right,\" he said calmly, \"I have other things on my mind, anyway. Since you won’t ask who the governess is, I’ll tell you myself. Wait—I have it here. It’s always better to see such things written down.\"\nHe took out his pocketbook, opened it, searched through it, and pulled out a torn, shabby slip of paper. I recognized the stained, paint-marked edge as from the margin of the cover of my old portrait. He stood up, held it to my eyes, and I read, written in Indian ink in my own handwriting—“JANE EYRE”—clearly scrawled absentmindedly at some earlier time.\n\n\"Briggs wrote to me about a Jane Eyre,\" he said, \"and the advertisements were for a Jane Eyre. I knew you as Jane Elliott. I suspected, but only confirmed it fully yesterday afternoon. Will you admit the name and give up your alias?\"\n\"Yes, yes; but where is Mr. Briggs? Maybe he knows more about Mr. Rochester than you do.\"\n\"Briggs is in London, but I doubt he knows anything about Mr. Rochester—he isn't interested in him anyway. Meanwhile, you’re focusing on irrelevant things instead of the essentials: you haven’t asked why Mr. Briggs was looking for you—what he wanted from you.\"\n\"So what did he want?\"\n\"Simply to tell you your uncle, Mr. Eyre from Madeira, has died and left you all his wealth. You are now rich—just that, nothing more.\"\n\"Me—rich?\"\n\"Yes, you are now quite an heiress.\"\nSilence fell for a moment.\n\"Of course, you’ll need to prove who you are,\" St. John continued, \"but that won’t be hard. Then you’ll be able to claim your inheritance immediately. The money is in English funds, with Briggs holding the will and the paperwork.\"\n\nThis was quite a shock! It is quite something, reader, to be suddenly raised from poverty to wealth, a remarkable thing indeed—but not one you can take in or really enjoy all of a sudden. Besides, there are other moments in life that are far more exciting—this is all very literal, grounded, and practical, leaving no room for fantasy. You don’t start jumping for joy on hearing you’ve inherited a fortune; instead, you start thinking of your new responsibilities; your steady satisfaction is accompanied by weighty concerns, so you stay composed and reflect on your good fortune solemnly.\n\nMoreover, words like ‘legacy’ and ‘bequest’ go hand in hand with ‘death’ and ‘funeral.’ My only relative, my uncle, was dead. Ever since I’d learned he existed, I’d hoped to meet him—and now I never would. And the money came to just me—not to me and a loving family, but to my solitary self. It was a magnificent gift, no doubt; independence would be glorious, and my heart swelled with the thought.\n\n\"You’re finally relaxing,\" said Mr. Rivers. \"I thought you’d turned to stone, like you’d seen Medusa. Maybe now you’ll ask how much you’ve inherited?\"\n\"How much do I have?\"\n\"Oh, it’s only a trifle. Nothing too significant—twenty thousand pounds, I believe—but what is that?\"\n\"Twenty thousand pounds?\""

He looked rather embarrassed.\n“You certainly shall not go till you have told me all,” I said.\n“I would rather not just now.”\n“You shall!—you must!”\n“I would rather Diana or Mary informed you.”\nOf course these objections wrought my eagerness to a climax: gratified it must be, and that without delay; and I told him so.\n“But I apprised you that I was a hard man,” said he, “difficult to persuade.”\n“And I am a hard woman,—impossible to put off.”\n“And then,” he pursued, “I am cold: no fervour infects me.”\n“Whereas I am hot, and fire dissolves ice. The blaze there has thawed all the snow from your cloak; by the same token, it has streamed on to my floor, and made it like a trampled street. As you hope ever to be forgiven, Mr. Rivers, the high crime and misdemeanour of spoiling a sanded kitchen, tell me what I wish to know.”\n“Well, then,” he said, “I yield; if not to your earnestness, to your perseverance: as stone is worn by continual dropping. Besides, you must know some day,—as well now as later. Your name is Jane Eyre?”\n“Of course: that was all settled before.”\n“You are not, perhaps, aware that I am your namesake?—that I was christened St. John Eyre Rivers?”\n“No, indeed! I remember now seeing the letter E. comprised in your initials written in books you have at different times lent me; but I never asked for what name it stood. But what then? Surely—”\nI stopped: I could not trust myself to entertain, much less to express, the thought that rushed upon me—that embodied itself,—that, in a second, stood out a strong, solid probability. Circumstances knit themselves, fitted themselves, shot into order: the chain that had been lying hitherto a formless lump of links was drawn out straight,—every ring was perfect, the connection complete. I knew, by instinct, how the matter stood, before St. John had said another word; but I cannot expect the reader to have the same intuitive perception, so I must repeat his explanation.\n“My mother’s name was Eyre; she had two brothers; one a clergyman, who married Miss Jane Reed, of Gateshead; the other, John Eyre, Esq., merchant, late of Funchal, Madeira. Mr. Briggs, being Mr. Eyre’s solicitor, wrote to us last August to inform us of our uncle’s death, and to say that he had left his property to his brother the clergyman’s orphan daughter, overlooking us, in consequence of a quarrel, never forgiven, between him and my father. He wrote again a few weeks since, to intimate that the heiress was lost, and asking if we knew anything of her. A name casually written on a slip of paper has enabled me to find her out. You know the rest.” Again he was going, but I set my back against the door.\n“Do let me speak,” I said; “let me have one moment to draw breath and reflect.” I paused—he stood before me, hat in hand, looking composed enough. I resumed—\n“Your mother was my father’s sister?”\n“Yes.”\n“My aunt, consequently?”\nHe bowed.\n“My uncle John was your uncle John? You, Diana, and Mary are his sister’s children, as I am his brother’s child?”\n“Undeniably.”\n“You three, then, are my cousins; half our blood on each side flows from the same source?”\n“We are cousins; yes.”",
          "paraphrase_gemini-2.5-flash-preview-04-17": "“No; to-night!—to-night!” he exclaimed, turning towards the door, but I positioned myself between him and the exit. He appeared somewhat discomposed. “You absolutely will not leave until you’ve told me everything,” I stated. “I’d prefer not to just now,” he replied. “You must! You have to!” I insisted. “I’d rather Diana or Mary explained it,” he suggested. Naturally, his reluctance heightened my impatience to an extreme degree; I felt the need to know the truth instantly, without delay, and I communicated this to him. “But I did warn you that I am a difficult man,” he said, “hard to sway.” “And I am a difficult woman,” I countered, “impossible to dismiss.” “Furthermore,” he added, “I am unfeeling; untouched by passion.” “Whereas I am passionate, and fire melts ice,” I responded. “The fire there has melted all the snow from your cloak; consequently, it has run onto my floor, making it messy like a well-trodden path. As you hope to be forgiven, Mr. Rivers, for the terrible offense of ruining a clean, sanded kitchen, tell me what I want to know.” “Very well,” he conceded, “I yield; if not to your earnestness, then to your persistence: like a stone worn down by constant dripping. Besides, you are bound to learn eventually—now is as good a time as any. Is your name Jane Eyre?” “Of course,” I replied, “that was established earlier.” “Perhaps you don't realize that I share your name? That my full baptismal name is St. John Eyre Rivers?” “No, indeed! I recall now seeing the initial ‘E’ within your initials written in books you’ve lent me at various times; but I never asked what name it stood for. But what does that signify? Surely—” I stopped myself; I couldn't allow myself to fully grasp, much less articulate, the idea that surged into my mind—it formed, solidified, becoming a strong, clear probability in an instant. Circumstances clicked into place, aligned perfectly, creating order. The chain that had been a disordered mass of links was straightened out; every link was perfect, the connection complete. Instinctively, I understood the situation before St. John uttered another word; however, I cannot expect the reader to have the same immediate intuition, so I must relay his explanation. “My mother’s maiden name was Eyre,” he began; “she had two brothers: one a clergyman, who married Miss Jane Reed of Gateshead; the other, John Eyre, Esq., a merchant, formerly residing in Funchal, Madeira. Mr. Briggs, Mr. Eyre’s solicitor, wrote to us last August to inform us of our uncle’s death and to state that he had left his estate to his clergyman brother’s orphaned daughter, ignoring us due to an unforgiven quarrel between him and my father. A few weeks ago, he wrote again to indicate that the heiress was missing and to inquire if we had any information about her. A name written by chance on a piece of paper allowed me to discover her identity. You know the rest.” He again made to leave, but I positioned myself against the door. “Please let me speak,” I said; “allow me a moment to catch my breath and think.” I paused; he stood before me, hat in hand, looking quite composed. I continued, “Your mother was my father’s sister?” “Yes.” “My aunt, then?” He nodded. “My uncle John was your uncle John? You, Diana, and Mary are his sister’s children, just as I am his brother’s child?” “Undeniably.” “Then you three are my cousins; half our lineage on both sides comes from the same source?” “We are cousins; yes,” he confirmed.",
          "paraphrase_gpt-4.1-2025-04-14": "\"No, tonight—tonight!\" I insisted, blocking his path at the door. He seemed a bit uncomfortable. \"You cannot leave until you've told me everything,\" I said. \"I'd rather not right now,\" he answered. \"But you must! I won't let you go otherwise!\" I insisted. \"I'd prefer Diana or Mary to tell you,\" he replied. These protests only made me more determined to know, and I declared that I had to be satisfied immediately. \"But I've already warned you that I'm a hard man, not easily convinced,\" he said. \"And I am a determined woman—not easily deceived or delayed,\" I countered. \"Plus,\" he continued, \"I'm cold and not given to strong emotion.\" \"But I'm warm and passionate; even now the fire has melted the snow from your cloak onto my floor, making a mess like a busy street. If you ever hope for forgiveness for ruining my sanded kitchen, Mr. Rivers, please tell me what I want to know.\" \"Very well,\" he relented. \"I give in—not so much to your earnestness as to your persistence. Even stone is worn away by constant dripping. Besides, you must know sometime, so it might as well be now. Your name is Jane Eyre, isn't it?\" \"Of course, that was already determined.\" \"You might not know that I share your name—I was christened St. John Eyre Rivers.\" \"I didn't realize that! Now, I do recall seeing the middle initial 'E.' in your books, but I never thought to ask its meaning. What does that signify? Surely...\" I trailed off, unable to put into words the revelation forming in my mind. Suddenly, all the pieces fit together perfectly—I realized the truth instinctively, even before St. John said more. But as I can't expect the reader to have my intuition, I'll recount his explanation. \"My mother was an Eyre—she had two brothers; one was a clergyman who married Miss Jane Reed of Gateshead, and the other, John Eyre, a merchant in Madeira. Mr. Briggs, the lawyer representing Mr. Eyre, wrote to us last August to report our uncle's death, saying he'd left his fortune to the clergyman's orphan daughter, ignoring us because of an unforgiven fight with my father. He wrote again a few weeks ago, saying the heiress was missing and asking if we had news of her. A name I discovered on a scrap of paper led me to you. The rest, you know.\" He was preparing to leave again, but I blocked the way. \"Please, let me speak—give me a moment to process this.\" I paused; he waited, calm. I continued, \"Your mother was my father's sister?\" \"Yes.\" \"So, my aunt?\" He nodded. \"My uncle John was yours too? You, Diana, and Mary are his sister's children, just as I am his brother's child?\" \"Exactly.\" \"Then you three are my cousins—we share half our blood from the same family?\" \"Yes, we are cousins.\""

Glorious discovery to a lonely wretch! This was wealth indeed!—wealth to the heart!—a mine of pure, genial affections.

This was a bright, lively, and uplifting gift, entirely unlike the heavy fortune of gold: valuable and useful in its own right, but made serious by its weight. I suddenly clapped my hands in joy—my heart pounded, my blood rushed. “Oh, I am so happy! I am so happy!” I cried out. St. John smiled. “Didn’t I tell you that you overlook important things in favour of trivial ones?” he asked. “You remained calm when I informed you about your inheritance, but now you are excited about something inconsequential.” “What could you possibly mean?

Those who had saved my life, whom, till this hour, I had loved barrenly, I could now benefit. They were under a yoke,—I could free them: they were scattered,—I could reunite them: the independence, the affluence which was mine, might be theirs too. Were we not four? Twenty thousand pounds shared equally would be five thousand each, justice—enough and to spare: justice would be done,—mutual happiness secured. Now the wealth did not weigh on me: now it was not a mere bequest of coin,—it was a legacy of life, hope, enjoyment.\nHow I looked while these ideas were taking my spirit by storm, I cannot tell; but I perceived soon that Mr. Rivers had placed a chair behind me, and was gently attempting to make me sit down on it.

I could now help the people who had saved my life, whom I had loved until this moment without being able to truly assist them. They were burdened by a difficult situation, and I could free them; they were apart, and I could bring them back together. The independence and wealth that was now mine could be theirs as well. Weren't there four of us? Twenty thousand pounds divided equally would be five thousand for each person, which was fair – more than enough, in fact.

You cannot fail to see that twenty thousand pounds, the sum in question, divided equally between the nephew and three nieces of our uncle, will give five thousand to each? What I want is, that you should write to your sisters and tell them of the fortune that has accrued to them.”\n“To you, you mean.”\n“I have intimated my view of the case: I am incapable of taking any other. I am not brutally selfish, blindly unjust, or fiendishly ungrateful. Besides, I am resolved I will have a home and connections. I like Moor House, and I will live at Moor House; I like Diana and Mary, and I will attach myself for life to Diana and Mary. It would please and benefit me to have five thousand pounds; it would torment and oppress me to have twenty thousand; which, moreover, could never be mine in justice, though it might in law. I abandon to you, then, what is absolutely superfluous to me. Let there be no opposition, and no discussion about it; let us agree amongst each other, and decide the point at once.”\n“This is acting on first impulses; you must take days to consider such a matter, ere your word can be regarded as valid.”\n“Oh! if all you doubt is my sincerity, I am easy: you see the justice of the case?”\n“I do see a certain justice; but it is contrary to all custom. Besides, the entire fortune is your right: my uncle gained it by his own efforts; he was free to leave it to whom he would: he left it to you. After all, justice permits you to keep it: you may, with a clear conscience, consider it absolutely your own.”\n“With me,” said I, “it is fully as much a matter of feeling as of conscience: I must indulge my feelings; I so seldom have had an opportunity of doing so. Were you to argue, object, and annoy me for a year, I could not forego the delicious pleasure of which I have caught a glimpse—that of repaying, in part, a mighty obligation, and winning to myself lifelong friends.”\n“You think so now,” rejoined St. John, “because you do not know what it is to possess, nor consequently to enjoy wealth: you cannot form a notion of the importance twenty thousand pounds would give you; of the place it would enable you to take in society; of the prospects it would open to you: you cannot—”\n“And you,” I interrupted, “cannot at all imagine the craving I have for fraternal and sisterly love. I never had a home, I never had brothers or sisters; I must and will have them now: you are not reluctant to admit me and own me, are you?”\n“Jane, I will be your brother—my sisters will be your sisters—without stipulating for this sacrifice of your just rights.”\n“Brother? Yes; at the distance of a thousand leagues! Sisters? Yes; slaving amongst strangers! I, wealthy—gorged with gold I never earned and do not merit! You, penniless! Famous equality and fraternisation! Close union! Intimate attachment!”\n“But, Jane, your aspirations after family ties and domestic happiness may be realised otherwise than by the means you contemplate: you may marry.”\n“Nonsense, again! Marry! I don’t want to marry, and never shall marry.”\n“That is saying too much: such hazardous affirmations are a proof of the excitement under which you labour.”\n“It is not saying too much: I know what I feel, and how averse are my inclinations to the bare thought of marriage. No one would take me for love; and I will not be regarded in the light of a mere money speculation. And I do not want a stranger—unsympathising, alien, different from me; I want my kindred: those with whom I have full fellow-feeling. Say again you will be my brother: when you uttered the words I was satisfied, happy; repeat them, if you can, repeat them sincerely.”\n“I think I can. I know I have always loved my own sisters; and I know on what my affection for them is grounded,—respect for their worth and admiration of their talents. You too have principle and mind: your tastes and habits resemble Diana’s and Mary’s; your presence is always agreeable to me; in your conversation I have already for some time found a salutary solace. I feel I can easily and naturally make room in my heart for you, as my third and youngest sister.”\n“Thank you: that contents me for to-night.",
          "paraphrase_gemini-2.5-flash-preview-04-17": "“Explain what?” Jane replied, slightly astonished. “It’s perfectly clear, isn’t it, that twenty thousand pounds, the amount in question, when divided equally among our uncle’s nephew and his three nieces, gives five thousand to each? My wish is simply that you write to your sisters and inform them about the fortune that has come to them.”\n“To you, you mean,” St. John corrected.\n“I have already stated my perspective on this matter,” Jane responded firmly, “and I cannot adopt any other. I am not being brutally selfish, blindly unfair, or monstrously ungrateful. Furthermore, I am determined to have a home and family connections. I love Moor House, and I will live there; I love Diana and Mary, and I will be devoted to them for the rest of my life. Having five thousand pounds would be pleasing and beneficial to me; possessing twenty thousand would be a torment and a burden, and what’s more, it could never truly be mine by right, although legally it might be. I am therefore relinquishing to you what is entirely surplus to my needs. Let there be no opposition or discussion about this; let us reach an agreement among ourselves and settle the matter immediately.”\n“This is an impulsive decision,” St. John argued. “You must take several days to consider such a thing before your word can be taken as final.”\n“Oh, if the only thing you doubt is my sincerity,” Jane said with relief, “then I am at ease. You do see the justice of my proposal, don’t you?”\n“I do see a certain fairness,” St. John admitted, “but it goes against all conventional practice. Besides, the entire fortune is legally yours. Our uncle earned it through his own efforts; he was free to leave it to whomever he wished, and he chose you. After all, justice allows you to keep it; you can, with a clear conscience, consider it absolutely your own.”\n“With me,” I replied, “it is just as much a matter of deep feeling as it is of conscience. I must indulge my feelings; I have so rarely had the opportunity to do so. Even if you were to argue, object, and distress me for an entire year, I could not abandon the wonderful joy I have caught a glimpse of – the joy of partially repaying a significant debt and gaining lifelong friends.”\n“You think so now,” St. John rejoined, “because you don’t know what it means to possess wealth, nor consequently to enjoy it. You cannot form any idea of the importance twenty thousand pounds would give you; of the position it would enable you to occupy in society; of the prospects it would open up for you; you cannot…”\n“And you,” I interrupted, “cannot possibly imagine the intense longing I have for a brother’s and sisters’ love. I never had a home, I never had siblings. I must and will have them now. You are not reluctant to accept me and acknowledge me, are you?”\n“Jane, I will be your brother, and my sisters will be your sisters, without demanding this sacrifice of your just rights.”\n“Brother?” I exclaimed, disappointed. “Yes, but at a distance of a thousand miles! Sisters? Yes, toiling among strangers! While I am wealthy – gorged with gold I never earned and do not deserve! And you are penniless! What remarkable equality and camaraderie! What close union! What intimate attachment!”\n“But, Jane, your desire for family ties and domestic happiness could be fulfilled through other means than the one you are considering. You could marry.”\n“Nonsense, again!” I retorted. “Marry! I have no desire to marry, and I never will.”\n“That is too absolute a statement,” St. John countered. “Such rash assertions are proof of the strong emotion you are currently experiencing.”\n“It is not too absolute,” I insisted. “I know how I feel, and how strongly my inclinations are against the mere thought of marriage. No one would marry me for love, and I refuse to be viewed simply as a financial speculation. And I do not want a stranger – someone unsympathetic, alien, different from me. I want my family, those with whom I share a complete understanding. Please say again that you will be my brother. When you spoke those words before, I felt content and happy. Repeat them, if you can; repeat them sincerely.”\n“I believe I can,” St. John said thoughtfully. “I know I have always loved my own sisters, and I know that my affection for them is based on respect for their character and admiration of their talents. You too possess moral principle and intellect; your tastes and habits resemble Diana’s and Mary’s; your presence is always agreeable to me; and in your conversation, I have for some time now found a beneficial comfort. I feel I can easily and naturally make room in my heart for you, as my third and youngest sister.”\n“Thank you,” I said, feeling satisfied. “That is enough for me tonight.”",

I now closed Morton school, taking care that the parting should not be barren on my side. Good fortune opens the hand as well as the heart wonderfully; and to give somewhat when we have largely received, is but to afford a vent to the unusual ebullition of the sensations. I had long felt with pleasure that many of my rustic scholars liked me, and when we parted, that consciousness was confirmed: they manifested their affection plainly and strongly. Deep was my gratification to find I had really a place in their unsophisticated hearts: I promised them that never a week should pass in future that I did not visit them, and give them an hour’s teaching in their school.\nMr. Rivers came up as, having seen the classes, now numbering sixty girls, file out before me, and locked the door, I stood with the key in my hand, exchanging a few words of special farewell with some half-dozen of my best scholars: as decent, respectable, modest, and well-informed young women as could be found in the ranks of the British peasantry. And that is saying a great deal; for after all, the British peasantry are the best taught, best mannered, most self-respecting of any in Europe: since those days I have seen paysannes and Bäuerinnen; and the best of them seemed to me ignorant, coarse, and besotted, compared with my Morton girls.\n“Do you consider you have got your reward for a season of exertion?” asked Mr. Rivers, when they were gone. “Does not the consciousness of having done some real good in your day and generation give pleasure?”\n“Doubtless.”\n“And you have only toiled a few months! Would not a life devoted to the task of regenerating your race be well spent?”\n“Yes,” I said; “but I could not go on for ever so: I want to enjoy my own faculties as well as to cultivate those of other people. I must enjoy them now; don’t recall either my mind or body to the school; I am out of it and disposed for full holiday.”\nHe looked grave. “What now? What sudden eagerness is this you evince? What are you going to do?”\n“To be active: as active as I can. And first I must beg you to set Hannah at liberty, and get somebody else to wait on you.”\n“Do you want her?”\n“Yes, to go with me to Moor House. Diana and Mary will be at home in a week, and I want to have everything in order against their arrival.”\n“I understand. I thought you were for flying off on some excursion. It is better so: Hannah shall go with you.”\n“Tell her to be ready by to-morrow then; and here is the schoolroom key: I will give you the key of my cottage in the morning.”\nHe took it. “You give it up very gleefully,” said he; “I don’t quite understand your light-heartedness, because I cannot tell what employment you propose to yourself as a substitute for the one you are relinquishing. What aim, what purpose, what ambition in life have you now?”\n“My first aim will be to clean down (do you comprehend the full force of the expression?)—to clean down Moor House from chamber to cellar; my next to rub it up with bees-wax, oil, and an indefinite number of cloths, till it glitters again; my third, to arrange every chair, table, bed, carpet, with mathematical precision; afterwards I shall go near to ruin you in coals and peat to keep up good fires in every room; and lastly, the two days preceding that on which your sisters are expected will be devoted by Hannah and me to such a beating of eggs, sorting of currants, grating of spices, compounding of Christmas cakes, chopping up of materials for mince-pies, and solemnising of other culinary rites, as words can convey but an inadequate notion of to the uninitiated like you. My purpose, in short, is to have all things in an absolutely perfect state of readiness for Diana and Mary before next Thursday; and my ambition is to give them a beau-ideal of a welcome when they come.”",

I finished teaching at Morton school, making sure to leave a positive impression. Good fortune is wonderful because it makes both the hand and the heart generous; giving back when you've received a lot is simply a way to express overwhelming feelings. I had long been happy knowing many of my rural students liked me, and this was confirmed when we said goodbye; they clearly and strongly showed their affection. I was deeply pleased to see I truly held a place in their simple, honest hearts. I promised them I would visit their school every single week going forward and teach them for an hour.\n\nMr. Rivers came over after I had watched the classes, which now included sixty girls, walk out in front of me. I had locked the door and stood with the key, saying a few extra goodbyes to about half a dozen of my best students. They were as decent, respectable, modest, and knowledgeable young women as you could find among working-class British people. And that's saying a lot, because British working people are, on the whole, the best educated, most polite, and most self-respecting in Europe. Since then, I've seen country women in other places, and even the best of them seemed uneducated, rough, and dull compared to my girls at Morton.\n\n“Do you feel you've been rewarded for your hard work?” Mr. Rivers asked when they were gone. “Doesn't knowing you've done some real good in your time and for your generation bring satisfaction?”\n\n“Absolutely,” I replied.\n\n“And you've only worked for a few months! Wouldn't a life dedicated to improving your community be time well spent?”\n\n“Yes,” I said, “but I couldn't keep going like that forever. I want to use my own abilities and not just help others develop theirs. I need to enjoy mine now. Don't talk about the school anymore; I'm finished with it and ready for a complete break.”\n\nHe looked serious. “What's this? What's this sudden eagerness you're showing? What do you plan to do?”\n\n“Be busy, as busy as possible. First, I need you to let Hannah go and find someone else to look after you.”\n\n“Do you need her?”\n\n“Yes, to come with me to Moor House. Diana and Mary will be home in a week, and I want everything ready for their arrival.”\n\n“I see. I thought you were planning a trip somewhere. This is better. Hannah can go with you.”\n\n“Tell her to be ready by tomorrow then. Here is the schoolroom key. I'll give you the key to my cottage in the morning.”\n\nHe took it. “You're giving it up very cheerfully,” he said. “I don't quite understand your happiness because I don't know what you plan to do instead of teaching. What is your goal, purpose, or ambition in life now?”\n\n“My first goal will be to completely clean (do you understand how thorough I mean?) to scrub down Moor House from top to bottom. My next is to polish it thoroughly with beeswax, oil, and countless cloths until it shines. My third is to arrange every chair, table, bed, and rug perfectly. After that, I'll probably use up all your coal and peat keeping good fires going in every room. Finally, the two days before your sisters arrive will be spent by Hannah and me beating eggs, sorting currants, grating spices, mixing Christmas cakes, chopping ingredients for mince pies, and performing other cooking tasks so complex that words can't fully explain them to someone inexperienced like you. My purpose, in short, is to have everything absolutely perfect for Diana and Mary before next Thursday, and my ambition is to give them the warmest possible welcome when they return.”\n",
          "paraphrase_gpt-4.1-2025-04-14": "By the time everything was resolved, Christmas was near and the holidays were approaching. I closed Morton school, ensuring that my farewell was meaningful. Good fortune encourages generosity, and sharing what we have when we've been given much helps express the gratitude we feel. I had enjoyed seeing the fondness my village students had for me, and our parting confirmed their affection. Their open display of appreciation gave me the deep satisfaction of knowing I held a place in their sincere hearts. I promised to visit them weekly and offer an hour of lessons even after the school closed.\n\nMr. Rivers approached as I watched my sixty pupils leave and was saying special farewells to a few outstanding girls, who were respectable and intelligent—a fine representation of the British peasantry, whom I consider better educated and mannered than any I’d seen in Europe. \n\nMr. Rivers asked if I felt that my efforts had been rewarded and if the sense of having done good was gratifying, to which I agreed. He wondered if giving one’s life to improving others would be worthwhile, but I replied that I also wanted to use and enjoy my own talents, not just nurture those of others. I was ready to leave school behind for a real holiday. \n\nHe noticed my excitement and questioned what I planned to do. I explained that I intended to be as active as possible and asked for Hannah to be relieved from her duties so she could help me prepare Moor House for Diana and Mary’s homecoming next week. He agreed and accepted the schoolroom key, commenting on my cheerful demeanor, and wondered what my new purpose would be now.\n\nI told him my immediate goal was to thoroughly clean Moor House, polish every surface, organize all furniture with care, keep fires burning in every room, and then, just before the sisters arrived, Hannah and I would be immersed in baking and preparing festive foods. In essence, I was determined that everything would be perfect to offer Diana and Mary the most wonderful welcome when they returned."

          "text_segment": "St. John smiled slightly: still he was dissatisfied.\n“It is all very well for the present,” said he; “but seriously, I trust that when the first flush of vivacity is over, you will look a little higher than domestic endearments and household joys.”\n“The best things the world has!” I interrupted.\n“No, Jane, no: this world is not the scene of fruition; do not attempt to make it so: nor of rest; do not turn slothful.”\n“I mean, on the contrary, to be busy.”\n“Jane, I excuse you for the present: two months’ grace I allow you for the full enjoyment of your new position, and for pleasing yourself with this late-found charm of relationship; but then, I hope you will begin to look beyond Moor House and Morton, and sisterly society, and the selfish calm and sensual comfort of civilised affluence. I hope your energies will then once more trouble you with their strength.”\nI looked at him with surprise. “St. John,” I said, “I think you are almost wicked to talk so. I am disposed to be as content as a queen, and you try to stir me up to restlessness! To what end?”\n“To the end of turning to profit the talents which God has committed to your keeping; and of which He will surely one day demand a strict account. Jane, I shall watch you closely and anxiously—I warn you of that. And try to restrain the disproportionate fervour with which you throw yourself into commonplace home pleasures. Don’t cling so tenaciously to ties of the flesh; save your constancy and ardour for an adequate cause; forbear to waste them on trite transient objects. Do you hear, Jane?”\n“Yes; just as if you were speaking Greek. I feel I have adequate cause to be happy, and I will be happy. Goodbye!”\nHappy at Moor House I was, and hard I worked; and so did Hannah: she was charmed to see how jovial I could be amidst the bustle of a house turned topsy-turvy—how I could brush, and dust, and clean, and cook. And really, after a day or two of confusion worse confounded, it was delightful by degrees to invoke order from the chaos ourselves had made. I had previously taken a journey to S—— to purchase some new furniture: my cousins having given me carte blanche to effect what alterations I pleased, and a sum having been set aside for that purpose. The ordinary sitting-room and bedrooms I left much as they were: for I knew Diana and Mary would derive more pleasure from seeing again the old homely tables, and chairs, and beds, than from the spectacle of the smartest innovations. Still some novelty was necessary, to give to their return the piquancy with which I wished it to be invested. Dark handsome new carpets and curtains, an arrangement of some carefully selected antique ornaments in porcelain and bronze, new coverings, and mirrors, and dressing-cases, for the toilet tables, answered the end: they looked fresh without being glaring. A spare parlour and bedroom I refurnished entirely, with old mahogany and crimson upholstery: I laid canvas on the passage, and carpets on the stairs. When all was finished, I thought Moor House as complete a model of bright modest snugness within, as it was, at this season, a specimen of wintry waste and desert dreariness without.\nThe eventful Thursday at length came. They were expected about dark, and ere dusk fires were lit upstairs and below; the kitchen was in perfect trim; Hannah and I were dressed, and all was in readiness.\nSt. John arrived first. I had entreated him to keep quite clear of the house till everything was arranged: and, indeed, the bare idea of the commotion, at once sordid and trivial, going on within its walls sufficed to scare him to estrangement. He found me in the kitchen, watching the progress of certain cakes for tea, then baking. Approaching the hearth, he asked, “If I was at last satisfied with housemaid’s work?” I answered by inviting him to accompany me on a general inspection of the result of my labours. With some difficulty, I got him to make the tour of the house. He just looked in at the doors I opened; and when he had wandered upstairs and downstairs, he said I must have gone through a great deal of fatigue and trouble to have effected such considerable changes in so short a time: but not a syllable did he utter indicating pleasure in the improved aspect of his abode.\nThis silence damped me. I thought perhaps the alterations had disturbed some old associations he valued. I inquired whether this was the case: no doubt in a somewhat crest-fallen tone.\n“Not at all; he had, on the contrary, remarked that I had scrupulously respected every association: he feared, indeed, I must have bestowed more thought on the matter than it was worth. How many minutes, for instance, had I devoted to studying the arrangement of this very room?—By-the-bye, could I tell him where such a book was?”\nI showed him the volume on the shelf: he took it down, and withdrawing to his accustomed window recess, he began to read it.\nNow, I did not like this, reader. St. John was a good man; but I began to feel he had spoken truth of himself when he said he was hard and cold. The humanities and amenities of life had no attraction for him—its peaceful enjoyments no charm. Literally, he lived only to aspire—after what was good and great, certainly; but still he would never rest, nor approve of others resting round him. As I looked at his lofty forehead, still and pale as a white stone—at his fine lineaments fixed in study—I comprehended all at once that he would hardly make a good husband: that it would be a trying thing to be his wife. I understood, as by inspiration, the nature of his love for Miss Oliver; I agreed with him that it was but a love of the senses. I comprehended how he should despise himself for the feverish influence it exercised over him; how he should wish to stifle and destroy it; how he should mistrust its ever conducting permanently to his happiness or hers. I saw he was of the material from which nature hews her heroes—Christian and Pagan—her lawgivers, her statesmen, her conquerors: a steadfast bulwark for great interests to rest upon; but, at the fireside, too often a cold cumbrous column, gloomy and out of place.\n“This parlour is not his sphere,” I reflected: “the Himalayan ridge or Caffre bush, even the plague-cursed Guinea Coast swamp would suit him better. Well may he eschew the calm of domestic life; it is not his element: there his faculties stagnate—they cannot develop or appear to advantage. It is in scenes of strife and danger—where courage is proved, and energy exercised, and fortitude tasked—that he will speak and move, the leader and superior. A merry child would have the advantage of him on this hearth. He is right to choose a missionary’s career—I see it now.”",
          "paraphrase_gemini-2.5-flash-preview-04-17": "St. John offered a faint smile but remained unsatisfied. He commented that her current situation was acceptable for the moment, but he earnestly hoped that once the initial burst of enthusiasm passed, she would aspire to something loftier than simple domestic affection and the pleasures of home life. I interjected that those were the finest things in the world. He countered, 'No, Jane, this world is not meant for total gratification, so don't try to make it so; nor is it for rest, so don't become lazy.' I declared, on the contrary, that I intended to be active. St. John excused me for the present, granting me two months to fully enjoy my new circumstances and the delight of discovering my family connection. After that, he hoped I would start looking beyond Moor House, Morton, my sisters' companionship, and the self-centred tranquility and physical comfort of a prosperous, civilized existence. He hoped my energies would then stir within me with their strength once more. I gazed at him with surprise. I told St. John that I thought he spoke almost wickedly. I was inclined to be as content as a queen, and he was trying to incite restlessness in me! To what end? He explained the purpose was to make profitable use of the talents God had entrusted to my care, for which He would certainly demand a strict account one day. He warned me that he would be observing me closely and with concern. He urged me to try to control the excessive passion with which I engaged in ordinary home enjoyments. He advised me not to cling so tightly to family ties but to save my loyalty and intensity for a worthy cause, avoiding wasting them on insignificant, fleeting things. He asked if I understood. I replied that I did, but it sounded like Greek to me. I felt I had a perfectly good reason to be happy, and I *would* be happy. Goodbye! I was indeed happy at Moor House and worked diligently, as did Hannah. She was charmed by how cheerful I could be amidst the upheaval of a house turned upside down—how adept I was at brushing, dusting, cleaning, and cooking. And truly, after a couple of days of even worse confusion, it was wonderful to gradually summon order from the chaos we had created. I had previously travelled to S—— to buy new furniture; my cousins had given me complete freedom to make any changes I liked, and a specific sum had been allocated for this. I largely kept the usual living room and bedrooms as they were, knowing Diana and Mary would get more pleasure from seeing their familiar old tables, chairs, and beds again than from the sight of completely new things. Still, some newness was necessary to give their return the special flavour I wanted it to have. Dark, attractive new carpets and curtains, a display of some carefully chosen old ornaments in porcelain and bronze, and new coverings, mirrors, and dressing cases for the vanity tables achieved this goal; they looked fresh without being garish. I completely refurnished a spare sitting room and bedroom with old mahogany furniture and crimson upholstery. I laid down canvas in the passage and carpets on the stairs. When everything was complete, I thought the interior of Moor House was a perfect example of cheerful, modest comfort, just as its exterior, at that time of year, was a picture of wintry desolation and stark emptiness. The awaited Thursday finally arrived. They were expected around nightfall, and before dusk, fires were lit upstairs and down; the kitchen was in perfect order; Hannah and I were dressed, and everything was prepared. St. John was the first to arrive. I had specifically asked him to stay away from the house until everything was ready, and indeed, the mere idea of the commotion, which he saw as both vulgar and trivial, taking place inside was enough to keep him distant. He found me in the kitchen, monitoring the progress of some cakes for tea that were baking. Approaching the hearth, he asked if I was at last content with doing a housemaid's job. I replied by inviting him to accompany me on a tour to see the results of my work. I managed with some difficulty to get him to walk through the house. He just glanced through the doors I opened; and after he had gone upstairs and downstairs, he remarked that I must have undergone a great deal of tiredness and trouble to have brought about such significant changes in such a short time. But he did not say a single word indicating pleasure in the improved appearance of his home. This silence dampened my spirits. I thought perhaps the changes had disturbed some old memories he cherished. I asked if this was the case, no doubt in a somewhat disheartened tone. He replied, 'Not at all; on the contrary, he had noticed that I had carefully respected every old aspect. In fact, he feared I must have devoted more thought to the matter than it was worth. For instance, how many minutes had I spent arranging this very room?' By the way, could I tell him where a certain book was? I showed him the book on the shelf; he took it down and, retreating to his usual spot by the window, began to read it. Now, I did not like this, reader. St. John was a good man, but I was starting to believe him when he said he was hard and cold. The gentle human interactions and courtesies of life held no appeal for him; its peaceful satisfactions had no charm. He literally lived only to strive—certainly for what was good and great—but still, he would never rest himself, nor approve of others resting around him. As I looked at his high forehead, still and pale as a white stone, and at his sharp features fixed in concentration, I suddenly understood that he would likely not make a good husband; that it would be a very trying experience to be his wife. I understood, as if by inspiration, the true nature of his feelings for Miss Oliver; I agreed with him that it was merely a physical attraction. I understood how he could despise himself for the intense power it held over him; how he would wish to suppress and eliminate it; how he would doubt it could ever lead to lasting happiness for him or her. I saw he was made of the stuff from which nature creates her heroes—Christian and pagan—her lawgivers, her statesmen, her conquerors: a steady foundation for important causes to rely upon; but, by the fireplace, too often a cold, awkward pillar, looking grim and out of place. I reflected that this living room was not his proper element. The Himalayan peak or the African bush, even the plague-ridden swamp on the Guinea Coast, would suit him better. No wonder he avoids the peace of domestic life; it is not his sphere. There, his abilities stagnate; they cannot develop or show themselves to advantage. It is in situations of conflict and danger—where courage is demonstrated, energy is used, and endurance is challenged—that he will speak and act as the leader and superior. A cheerful child would be more at ease than he is on this hearth. He is right to choose a missionary's career—I see it clearly now.",
          "paraphrase_gpt-4.1-2025-04-14": "St. John gave a slight smile but was still not satisfied. \"This is fine for now,\" he said, \"but I sincerely hope that when the initial excitement fades, you will aspire to more than just family affection and home comforts.\" I interrupted him, saying, \"Those are the best things the world has to offer!\" He replied, \"No, Jane. This world isn't the place for ultimate fulfillment, nor should it be a place of rest; don't become idle.\" I responded that I intended, on the contrary, to stay busy. St. John told me he'd excuse my contentment for the time being: I'd have two months to fully enjoy my new home and newly found family ties. After that, though, he hoped I would seek something beyond the comforts of Moor House, beyond family life, and not waste my energy on the easy pleasures of wealth and comfort. He wanted my energies to drive me toward greater things.\n\nSurprised, I asked why he was trying to make me restless when I just wanted to be happy. He answered that he wanted me to use the talents God had given me, for which I'd need to give an account one day. He warned he'd be keeping a close eye on me, urging me not to invest too much emotion into ordinary home life, but to save my passion for a truly worthy cause.\n\nI joked that he might as well be speaking Greek, as I intended to be happy and would not let him talk me out of it. Then I told him goodbye.\n\nDuring this time, I was indeed happy at Moor House and worked hard, alongside Hannah, who was pleased to see how cheerful I could be amid the busy household chores. We slowly brought order out of chaos, especially after I'd bought new furniture for the house with my cousins' blessing. I chose not to change the main living areas too much, knowing Diana and Mary would appreciate seeing their old familiar furniture upon their return. Still, I added some new touches for freshness and redecorated a spare room and bedroom with new furnishings. By the time I finished, Moor House felt as bright and comfortable inside as it seemed desolate and bleak outside during winter.\n\nThe long-awaited Thursday finally arrived. Everything was ready for Diana and Mary’s arrival, and Hannah and I were prepared.\n\nSt. John arrived first. I had asked him to stay away until everything was settled, since even the idea of the household commotion made him uncomfortable. He found me in the kitchen, watching cakes bake for tea, and asked if I was satisfied with my maid’s work. I invited him to see the house, but he only barely glanced at the rooms as we walked through. He remarked on the effort it must have taken, but said nothing to indicate he was pleased by the improvements.\n\nHis silence disappointed me; I wondered if maybe the changes had disturbed old memories he valued. When I asked, he assured me I'd respected all associations, but he feared I had spent more effort on it than necessary. Then, he asked for a particular book, which I showed him, and he retreated to read in his usual spot.\n\nI began to feel uncomfortable. St. John was a good man, but I saw he was indeed as hard and cold as he said he was. He had little interest in the comforts and small pleasures of daily life; he lived only for high aspirations. He could not rest, nor allow those around him to rest. Seeing him so absorbed in study, I suddenly understood he would not make a good husband—it would be hard to be his wife. I realized his feelings for Miss Oliver were only physical, and he resented the power those emotions held over him. He was made for great deeds and leadership, but at home, he was cold and out of place—a grand but gloomy fixture. I thought to myself that home life was not for him; he would thrive where there was challenge and danger, not in peaceful domesticity. He was right to seek a missionary's life; now I understood why."

It was now dark; but a rumbling of wheels was audible. Hannah soon had a lantern lit. The vehicle had stopped at the wicket; the driver opened the door: first one well-known form, then another, stepped out. In a minute I had my face under their bonnets, in contact first with Mary’s soft cheek, then with Diana’s flowing curls. They laughed—kissed me—then Hannah: patted Carlo, who was half wild with delight; asked eagerly if all was well; and being assured in the affirmative, hastened into the house.\nThey were stiff with their long and jolting drive from Whitcross, and chilled with the frosty night air; but their pleasant countenances expanded to the cheerful firelight. While the driver and Hannah brought in the boxes, they demanded St. John. At this moment he advanced from the parlour. They both threw their arms round his neck at once. He gave each one quiet kiss, said in a low tone a few words of welcome, stood a while to be talked to, and then, intimating that he supposed they would soon rejoin him in the parlour, withdrew there as to a place of refuge.\nI had lit their candles to go upstairs, but Diana had first to give hospitable orders respecting the driver; this done, both followed me. They were delighted with the renovation and decorations of their rooms; with the new drapery, and fresh carpets, and rich tinted china vases: they expressed their gratification ungrudgingly. I had the pleasure of feeling that my arrangements met their wishes exactly, and that what I had done added a vivid charm to their joyous return home.\nSweet was that evening. My cousins, full of exhilaration, were so eloquent in narrative and comment, that their fluency covered St. John’s taciturnity: he was sincerely glad to see his sisters; but in their glow of fervour and flow of joy he could not sympathise. The event of the day—that is, the return of Diana and Mary—pleased him; but the accompaniments of that event, the glad tumult, the garrulous glee of reception irked him: I saw he wished the calmer morrow was come. In the very meridian of the night’s enjoyment, about an hour after tea, a rap was heard at the door. Hannah entered with the intimation that “a poor lad was come, at that unlikely time, to fetch Mr. Rivers to see his mother, who was drawing away.”\n“Where does she live, Hannah?”\n“Clear up at Whitcross Brow, almost four miles off, and moor and moss all the way.”\n“Tell him I will go.”\n“I’m sure, sir, you had better not. It’s the worst road to travel after dark that can be: there’s no track at all over the bog. And then it is such a bitter night—the keenest wind you ever felt. You had better send word, sir, that you will be there in the morning.”\nBut he was already in the passage, putting on his cloak; and without one objection, one murmur, he departed. It was then nine o’clock: he did not return till midnight. Starved and tired enough he was: but he looked happier than when he set out. He had performed an act of duty; made an exertion; felt his own strength to do and deny, and was on better terms with himself.",
          "paraphrase_gemini-2.5-flash-preview-04-17": "“They’re here! They’re arriving!” exclaimed Hannah, pulling open the parlour door. At the same moment, old Carlo barked enthusiastically. I dashed outside. It was now dark, but the sound of carriage wheels rumbling was audible. Hannah quickly lit a lantern. The vehicle had halted at the gate, and the driver opened the door; first one recognisable figure, then another, stepped out. Instantly, I had my face beneath their bonnets, making contact first with Mary’s soft cheek, then with Diana’s flowing curls. They laughed, embraced me, then Hannah, petted Carlo, who was nearly ecstatic with delight, and eagerly asked if everything was well. Reassured that all was fine, they hurried indoors. Their long, jarring journey from Whitcross had left them stiff and chilled by the frosty night air, but their pleasant faces brightened in the cheerful firelight. While the driver and Hannah brought in the luggage, they inquired about St. John. Just then, he came forward from the parlour. Both sisters immediately wrapped their arms around his neck. He gave each a quiet kiss, spoke a few low words of welcome, stood to converse briefly, and then, suggesting they would soon join him in the parlour, retreated there as if seeking refuge. I had prepared candles for them to go upstairs, but Diana first needed to issue instructions regarding the driver, as a hospitable host would; once this was done, both followed me. They were thrilled with the renovations and decorations in their rooms, the new curtains, fresh carpets, and richly coloured china vases. They expressed their satisfaction freely. I felt pleased that my preparations precisely met their desires and that what I had done added a noticeable charm to their happy return home. That evening was sweet. My cousins, full of lively spirits, were so eloquent in telling stories and making remarks that their fluency masked St. John’s silence. He was genuinely happy to see his sisters, but he could not share in their intense excitement and flowing joy. The primary event—the return of Diana and Mary—pleased him, but the surrounding circumstances, the cheerful commotion, and the chatty pleasure of the welcome irritated him. I could see he wished for the calmer next day. At the height of the night's enjoyment, about an hour after tea, a knock was heard at the door. Hannah entered, announcing that “a poor boy had arrived, at this inconvenient time, to get Mr. Rivers to visit his mother, who was near death.” “Where is she located, Hannah?” “Right up at Whitcross Brow, almost four miles away, the entire route across moorland and bog.” “Tell him I will go.” “Sir, I really think you shouldn't. It's the most dangerous road to travel after dark; there’s absolutely no clear path over the bog. And it’s such a harsh night—the most biting wind you've ever encountered. You ought to send word, sir, that you will come in the morning.” However, he was already in the hallway, putting on his cloak; and without a single objection or complaint, he departed. It was then nine in the evening; he did not return until midnight. He was quite hungry and exhausted, yet he looked more content than when he left. He had fulfilled a duty, made a strenuous effort, recognized his capacity for action and self-denial, and felt more satisfied with himself.",
          "paraphrase_gpt-4.1-2025-04-14": "\"They are coming! They are coming!\" Hannah exclaimed as she flung open the parlour door. At that instant, old Carlo barked with happiness. I rushed outside. It was already dark, but I could hear the sound of approaching wheels. Hannah quickly lit a lantern. The carriage had stopped at the gate; the driver opened the door and two familiar figures emerged. In moments, I was embracing them, first pressing my face to Mary’s soft cheek, then to Diana’s wavy hair. They laughed and kissed me, and then Hannah; they patted an ecstatic Carlo, asked eagerly if everything was alright, and after being reassured, hurried inside.\n\nThey were stiff from their long, bumpy journey from Whitcross and cold from the frosty night air, but their faces brightened at the sight of the cheerful fire. While the driver and Hannah carried in the luggage, they asked for St. John. At that moment, he came out of the parlour. Both girls immediately hugged him around the neck. He quietly kissed each sister, greeted them softly, stood with them a short while, and then, signaling that they would find him in the parlour, withdrew there to enjoy some solitude.\n\nI had already lit candles for them to go upstairs, but Diana paused to give kind instructions for the driver’s comfort; once that was done, both followed me. They were delighted with the improvements and decorations in their rooms—the new curtains, fresh carpets, and colourful china vases—and expressed their pleasure warmly. I was pleased that my efforts suited their tastes, and that my preparations had made their homecoming even more joyful.\n\nThat evening was a happy one. My cousins, bubbling with excitement, were wonderfully talkative and entertaining, which helped to make up for St. John’s quietness. He was genuinely pleased to see his sisters, but he couldn’t quite share their lively joy. He was happy about their return, but the noise and exuberant atmosphere did not suit him, and I could tell he wished for the calmer day to come. In the midst of the cheerful evening, about an hour after tea, there was a knock at the door. Hannah entered to announce that a poor boy had come, at that late hour, to ask Mr. Rivers to visit his mother, who was near death.\n\n\"Where does she live, Hannah?\"\n\n\"Up at Whitcross Brow, nearly four miles away, across moor and marsh all the way.\"\n\n\"Tell him I will go.\"\n\n\"I’m sure, sir, it’s not wise. It’s a terrible road after dark—there isn’t even a proper path across the bog. And it’s such a bitter night, with the coldest wind you can imagine. Perhaps it would be better if you sent word that you’ll come in the morning.\"\n\nBut he was already in the hall, putting on his cloak, and without a word of complaint, he left. It was nine o’clock then; he didn’t return until midnight. He came back cold and exhausted, but looking happier than when he’d left; he had done his duty, made a sincere effort, proven his own resolve to act and endure, and felt more at peace with himself."

The air of the moors, the freedom of home, the dawn of prosperity, acted on Diana and Mary’s spirits like some life-giving elixir: they were gay from morning till noon, and from noon till night. They could always talk; and their discourse, witty, pithy, original, had such charms for me, that I preferred listening to, and sharing in it, to doing anything else. St. John did not rebuke our vivacity; but he escaped from it: he was seldom in the house; his parish was large, the population scattered, and he found daily business in visiting the sick and poor in its different districts.\nOne morning at breakfast, Diana, after looking a little pensive for some minutes, asked him, “If his plans were yet unchanged.”\n“Unchanged and unchangeable,” was the reply. And he proceeded to inform us that his departure from England was now definitively fixed for the ensuing year.\n“And Rosamond Oliver?” suggested Mary, the words seeming to escape her lips involuntarily: for no sooner had she uttered them, than she made a gesture as if wishing to recall them. St. John had a book in his hand—it was his unsocial custom to read at meals—he closed it, and looked up.\n“Rosamond Oliver,” said he, “is about to be married to Mr. Granby, one of the best connected and most estimable residents in S——, grandson and heir to Sir Frederic Granby: I had the intelligence from her father yesterday.”\nHis sisters looked at each other and at me; we all three looked at him: he was serene as glass.\n“The match must have been got up hastily,” said Diana: “they cannot have known each other long.”\n“But two months: they met in October at the county ball at S——. But where there are no obstacles to a union, as in the present case, where the connection is in every point desirable, delays are unnecessary: they will be married as soon as S—— Place, which Sir Frederic gives up to them, can be refitted for their reception.”\nThe first time I found St. John alone after this communication, I felt tempted to inquire if the event distressed him: but he seemed so little to need sympathy, that, so far from venturing to offer him more, I experienced some shame at the recollection of what I had already hazarded. Besides, I was out of practice in talking to him: his reserve was again frozen over, and my frankness was congealed beneath it. He had not kept his promise of treating me like his sisters; he continually made little chilling differences between us, which did not at all tend to the development of cordiality: in short, now that I was acknowledged his kinswoman, and lived under the same roof with him, I felt the distance between us to be far greater than when he had known me only as the village schoolmistress. When I remembered how far I had once been admitted to his confidence, I could hardly comprehend his present frigidity.",
          "paraphrase_gemini-2.5-flash-preview-04-17": "I fear the following week tested St. John’s tolerance. It was the Christmas holiday period, and we abandoned our usual tasks, instead enjoying a sort of cheerful, informal family time. The refreshing air of the moors, the sense of being at home, and the beginning of better financial circumstances acted on Diana and Mary’s spirits like a revitalizing tonic; they were cheerful from morning until night. They were always ready to converse, and their discussions, marked by wit, sharpness, and originality, were so captivating to me that I preferred listening to and participating in them over doing anything else. St. John didn’t criticize our liveliness, but he avoided it. He was rarely at home, as his parish was large with a widely spread population, and he occupied his days visiting the sick and the poor in its various areas. One morning during breakfast, Diana, after appearing thoughtful for a few moments, inquired if his plans remained the same. 'Unchanged and fixed,' he replied. He then proceeded to inform us that his departure from England was now definitely scheduled for the upcoming year. 'And Rosamond Oliver?' Mary asked, the words seeming to slip out unexpectedly, as she made a gesture as if to retract them immediately after speaking. St. John had a book in his hand – it was his usual solitary habit to read during meals – he closed it and looked up. 'Rosamond Oliver,' he stated, 'is set to marry Mr. Granby, one of the most respected and well-connected residents in S——, the grandson and heir of Sir Frederic Granby. I received this information from her father yesterday.' His sisters exchanged glances with each other and then with me; the three of us then looked at him. He appeared completely calm and unmoved. 'The engagement must have happened very quickly,' Diana commented, 'they can’t have known each other for long.' 'Only two months; they met in October at the county ball in S——. However, when there are no barriers to a union, as in this situation, where the match is entirely suitable in every respect, delays are unnecessary. They will marry as soon as S—— Place, which Sir Frederic is giving them, can be renovated for their arrival.' The first time I was alone with St. John after this news, I was tempted to ask if the event troubled him. However, he seemed so completely unaffected that, far from daring to offer him more sympathy, I felt a sense of embarrassment remembering my previous attempts. Furthermore, I was out of practice in talking freely with him. His reserve had solidified again, and my openness was frozen beneath it. He had not kept his promise to treat me like his sisters; he consistently created subtle, chilling distinctions between us that did nothing to encourage warmth. In short, now that I was acknowledged as his relative and shared his home, I felt the emotional distance between us was far greater than when he had only known me as the village schoolmistress. When I recalled how much he had once confided in me, I found his current coldness almost incomprehensible.",
          "paraphrase_gpt-4.1-2025-04-14": "I fear that St. John’s patience was put to the test throughout the following week. It was Christmas, and instead of following any routine, we indulged in cheerful, relaxed home activities. The fresh moor air, the comfort of being at home, and the promise of better times boosted Diana and Mary’s spirits, making them lively and cheerful all throughout the day. They were constantly conversing, their talk witty, clever, and unique, and I enjoyed listening and joining in more than doing anything else. St. John did not scold us for our high spirits, but he avoided them, spending little time at home as his large, spread-out parish kept him occupied visiting the sick and poor each day.\n\nOne breakfast, Diana, looking thoughtful, asked St. John whether his plans had changed. He replied firmly they were the same, and then told us his departure from England was now definitely set for the coming year.\n\nThen Mary, almost accidentally, brought up Rosamond Oliver. St. John, who had been reading, closed his book and replied that Rosamond was about to marry Mr. Granby, a well-connected and highly regarded local man, and that her father had told him this the day before.\n\nHis sisters and I exchanged glances, then looked at him, but he seemed perfectly calm. Diana remarked the engagement seemed sudden since they hadn’t known each other long. He explained they'd only met two months prior but, as there was nothing to prevent their marriage, there was no need for delay, and they’d be wed as soon as Mr. Granby’s new home was ready for them.\n\nLater, when I was alone with St. John, I wanted to ask if he was upset by the news, but he seemed unaffected and in no need of sympathy; I even felt embarrassed for having previously offered any. Also, talking to him had become difficult again—his reserved demeanor had returned, and my own openness had cooled in response. He failed to treat me as he did his sisters, preserving small cold formalities between us which stopped any warmth from developing. In fact, now that I was recognized as his relative and lived in the same house, the gap between us felt wider than when I’d only been the village schoolteacher. Remembering how close he’d once let me come to his confidence, I found his current coldness hard to understand."

Would not such another ruin you?”\n“I think not; and if I were, it does not much signify; I shall never be called upon to contend for such another. The event of the conflict is decisive: my way is now clear; I thank God for it!” So saying, he returned to his papers and his silence.\nAs our mutual happiness (i.e., Diana’s, Mary’s, and mine) settled into a quieter character, and we resumed our usual habits and regular studies, St. John stayed more at home: he sat with us in the same room, sometimes for hours together. While Mary drew, Diana pursued a course of encyclopædic reading she had (to my awe and amazement) undertaken, and I fagged away at German, he pondered a mystic lore of his own: that of some Eastern tongue, the acquisition of which he thought necessary to his plans.\nThus engaged, he appeared, sitting in his own recess, quiet and absorbed enough; but that blue eye of his had a habit of leaving the outlandish-looking grammar, and wandering over, and sometimes fixing upon us, his fellow-students, with a curious intensity of observation: if caught, it would be instantly withdrawn; yet ever and anon, it returned searchingly to our table. I wondered what it meant: I wondered, too, at the punctual satisfaction he never failed to exhibit on an occasion that seemed to me of small moment, namely, my weekly visit to Morton school; and still more was I puzzled when, if the day was unfavourable, if there was snow, or rain, or high wind, and his sisters urged me not to go, he would invariably make light of their solicitude, and encourage me to accomplish the task without regard to the elements.\n“Jane is not such a weakling as you would make her,” he would say: “she can bear a mountain blast, or a shower, or a few flakes of snow, as well as any of us. Her constitution is both sound and elastic;—better calculated to endure variations of climate than many more robust.”\nAnd when I returned, sometimes a good deal tired, and not a little weather-beaten, I never dared complain, because I saw that to murmur would be to vex him: on all occasions fortitude pleased him; the reverse was a special annoyance.\nOne afternoon, however, I got leave to stay at home, because I really had a cold. His sisters were gone to Morton in my stead: I sat reading Schiller; he, deciphering his crabbed Oriental scrolls. As I exchanged a translation for an exercise, I happened to look his way: there I found myself under the influence of the ever-watchful blue eye. How long it had been searching me through and through, and over and over, I cannot tell: so keen was it, and yet so cold, I felt for the moment superstitious—as if I were sitting in the room with something uncanny.\n“Jane, what are you doing?”\n“Learning German.”\n“I want you to give up German and learn Hindostanee.”\n“You are not in earnest?”\n“In such earnest that I must have it so: and I will tell you why.”\nHe then went on to explain that Hindostanee was the language he was himself at present studying; that, as he advanced, he was apt to forget the commencement; that it would assist him greatly to have a pupil with whom he might again and again go over the elements, and so fix them thoroughly in his mind; that his choice had hovered for some time between me and his sisters; but that he had fixed on me because he saw I could sit at a task the longest of the three. Would I do him this favour? I should not, perhaps, have to make the sacrifice long, as it wanted now barely three months to his departure.\nSt. John was not a man to be lightly refused: you felt that every impression made on him, either for pain or pleasure, was deep-graved and permanent. I consented. When Diana and Mary returned, the former found her scholar transferred from her to her brother: she laughed, and both she and Mary agreed that St. John should never have persuaded them to such a step. He answered quietly—\n“I know it.”\nI found him a very patient, very forbearing, and yet an exacting master: he expected me to do a great deal; and when I fulfilled his expectations, he, in his own way, fully testified his approbation. By degrees, he acquired a certain influence over me that took away my liberty of mind: his praise and notice were more restraining than his indifference. I could no longer talk or laugh freely when he was by, because a tiresomely importunate instinct reminded me that vivacity (at least in me) was distasteful to him. I was so fully aware that only serious moods and occupations were acceptable, that in his presence every effort to sustain or follow any other became vain: I fell under a freezing spell. When he said “go,” I went; “come,” I came; “do this,” I did it. But I did not love my servitude: I wished, many a time, he had continued to neglect me.",
          "paraphrase_gemini-2.5-flash-preview-04-17": "I was quite surprised, considering the circumstances, when he abruptly lifted his head from the desk he was bent over and declared, \"You see, Jane, the struggle is finished and the victory achieved.\" Startled by being addressed in this manner, I didn't immediately reply. After a brief hesitation, I asked in return, \"But are you certain you aren't in the position of those conquerors whose triumphs have been excessively costly? Would another such effort not destroy you?\" He responded, \"I don't believe so; and even if I were, it's not of great importance; I will never be required to fight for such a thing again. The result of this conflict is final; my path is now clear, and I thank God for it!\" Having said this, he returned to his papers and his silence. As our collective happiness (meaning Diana's, Mary's, and mine) settled into a more tranquil state, and we resumed our usual routines and dedicated studies, St. John spent more time at home. He would sit with us in the same room, sometimes for hours at a time. While Mary drew, Diana pursued an extensive course of reading that encompassed a wide range of knowledge (to my awe and astonishment), and I diligently worked on German, he contemplated his own specific area of study: the arcane knowledge of some Eastern language, which he deemed necessary for his plans. Engaged in this manner, he appeared quiet and deeply focused, sitting in his designated spot. However, those blue eyes of his had a tendency to leave the foreign-looking grammar book and wander over, occasionally fixing upon us, his fellow students, with a strangely intense gaze. If caught, his eyes would instantly withdraw, yet time and again, they would return to our table, seemingly searching. I wondered what this behavior signified. I was also puzzled by the consistent satisfaction he always displayed regarding something that seemed minor to me: my weekly visit to the school at Morton. I was even more perplexed when, if the weather was poor—snowy, rainy, or windy—and his sisters urged me not to go, he would invariably dismiss their concern and encourage me to complete the task regardless of the conditions. \"Jane isn't as fragile as you make her out to be,\" he would say. \"She can withstand a strong wind, a rain shower, or a few snowflakes as well as any of us. Her physical constitution is both robust and resilient—better suited to endure changes in climate than many who appear stronger.\" And when I returned, sometimes quite tired and noticeably affected by the weather, I never dared to complain because I saw that expressing discontent would displease him. He was always pleased by resilience, while the opposite was particularly irritating to him. However, one afternoon, I was allowed to stay home because I genuinely had a cold. His sisters went to Morton in my place. I sat reading Schiller, while he was decoding his difficult Oriental scrolls. As I switched from translating to doing an exercise, I happened to glance his way and found myself under the influence of that perpetually watchful blue eye. How long it had been scrutinizing me, inside and out, I cannot say. It was so sharp, yet so devoid of warmth, that for a moment I felt a superstitious chill—as though I were in the room with something otherworldly. \"Jane, what are you working on?\" he asked. \"Learning German,\" I replied. \"I want you to stop learning German and learn Hindostanee,\" he stated. \"You can't be serious?\" I said. \"So serious that it must be done,\" he insisted. \"And I will explain why.\" He then proceeded to clarify that Hindostanee was the language he was currently studying; that, as he progressed, he was prone to forgetting the basics; and that having a pupil with whom he could review the fundamental elements repeatedly would greatly assist him in firmly embedding them in his mind. He had considered either me or his sisters for some time but had decided on me because he saw I could stick to a task for the longest period among the three. Would I do him this favor? He mentioned that the sacrifice might not be long, as his departure was now barely three months away. St. John was not a man one could easily refuse; you felt that every impression made upon him, whether causing pain or pleasure, was deeply etched and permanent. I agreed. When Diana and Mary returned, the former discovered that her student had been transferred from her charge to her brother's. She laughed, and both she and Mary agreed that St. John could never have convinced them to take such a step. He replied calmly, \"I am aware of that.\" I found him to be a very patient and tolerant, yet demanding, instructor. He expected a great deal from me, and when I fulfilled his expectations, he expressed his approval fully in his own way. Gradually, he acquired a certain sway over me that seemed to rob me of my mental autonomy. His praise and notice were more restrictive than his indifference. I could no longer speak or laugh freely when he was present because a bothersomely persistent inner sense reminded me that cheerfulness (at least from me) was displeasing to him. I was so completely aware that only serious moods and activities were acceptable that in his presence, any attempt to maintain or pursue anything else proved futile; I fell under a chilling enchantment. When he commanded \"go,\" I went; \"come,\" I came; \"do this,\" I did it. But I did not enjoy this state of obedience; many times, I wished he had continued to ignore me.",
          "paraphrase_gpt-4.1-2025-04-14": "Given these circumstances, I was quite surprised when he suddenly looked up from the desk where he was bent over and said, \"You see, Jane, the fight is over and I've won.\" Taken aback at being spoken to in this way, I didn't answer right away; after a brief pause, I replied, \"But are you sure you are not like those victors who pay too high a price for success? Wouldn't one more battle like that destroy you?\" He responded, \"I don't think so; and even if it would, it doesn't matter much, as I will not have to face such a struggle again. The outcome is final; my path is now clear and I thank God for it!\" With that, he went back to his papers and his silence.\n\nAs our mutual happiness—meaning Diana's, Mary's, and mine—became more subdued, and we settled back into our routines and studies, St. John started staying at home more. He would often sit in the same room with us, sometimes for hours: Mary would draw, Diana would read a vast array of books (which amazed me), and I worked hard on my German, while St. John studied an ancient Eastern language he believed he needed for his plans. He seemed quiet and engrossed in his own work, but his blue eyes would often leave his peculiar grammar book to observe us with an intense, searching look; if we noticed, he'd look away, but would often return to watch us again. I wondered what he was thinking. I also noticed he always seemed pleased when I visited Morton school weekly—a task I saw as minor—and I was even more puzzled that, no matter how bad the weather, when his sisters suggested I stay in, he always encouraged me to go, dismissing their concern.\n\n\"Jane isn’t as delicate as you think,\" he'd say. \"She can withstand wind, rain, or snow as well as any of us. She’s strong and resilient—better adapted to harsh climates than some who look sturdier.\"\n\nWhen I came home worn out and weather-beaten, I never complained, knowing it would annoy him; he valued endurance above all else, and disliked complaints.\n\nOne afternoon, though, I stayed home because I had a cold. His sisters went to Morton instead, and I sat reading Schiller while St. John worked on his complicated Eastern texts. As I swapped one book for another, I happened to look at him and felt the sharp gaze of his blue eyes on me—so steady and cold I felt uneasy, almost as if something supernatural was in the room.\n\n\"Jane, what are you doing?\"\n\"Studying German.\"\n\"I want you to stop with German and learn Hindostanee instead.\"\n\"You can't be serious?\"\n\"I am—it's imperative. Let me explain.\"\n\nHe said he was studying Hindostanee, but sometimes forgot the basics as he advanced, and it would help him greatly to have a pupil he could repeat the fundamentals with, to reinforce them in his mind. He had considered both me and his sisters, but chose me because I could focus on a task longer than they could. Would I do this for him? The commitment would only last about three months, as he was leaving soon.\n\nSt. John wasn't someone you could easily refuse; everything that affected him made a lasting impression. I agreed. When Diana and Mary came back, they found I'd become St. John's student. Diana laughed, saying he’d never have convinced her or Mary to do it. He calmly replied, “I know.”\n\nHe turned out to be a patient and tolerant but demanding teacher—he expected a lot, and when I met his standards, he showed his approval in his own way. Gradually, he gained an influence over me that restricted my freedom of thought; his praise and attention felt more confining than indifference. In his presence, I couldn't talk or laugh freely, because I knew that cheerfulness, at least in me, displeased him. I became so aware that only seriousness and somber occupations were welcome that trying to act otherwise became pointless. I did whatever he asked, but I did not enjoy being under his control, and often wished he would go back to ignoring me."

I thought Diana very provoking, and felt uncomfortably confused; and while I was thus thinking and feeling, St. John bent his head; his Greek face was brought to a level with mine, his eyes questioned my eyes piercingly—he kissed me. There are no such things as marble kisses or ice kisses, or I should say my ecclesiastical cousin’s salute belonged to one of these classes; but there may be experiment kisses, and his was an experiment kiss. When given, he viewed me to learn the result; it was not striking: I am sure I did not blush; perhaps I might have turned a little pale, for I felt as if this kiss were a seal affixed to my fetters. He never omitted the ceremony afterwards, and the gravity and quiescence with which I underwent it, seemed to invest it for him with a certain charm.\nAs for me, I daily wished more to please him; but to do so, I felt daily more and more that I must disown half my nature, stifle half my faculties, wrest my tastes from their original bent, force myself to the adoption of pursuits for which I had no natural vocation. He wanted to train me to an elevation I could never reach; it racked me hourly to aspire to the standard he uplifted. The thing was as impossible as to mould my irregular features to his correct and classic pattern, to give to my changeable green eyes the sea-blue tint and solemn lustre of his own.\nNot his ascendancy alone, however, held me in thrall at present. Of late it had been easy enough for me to look sad: a cankering evil sat at my heart and drained my happiness at its source—the evil of suspense.\nPerhaps you think I had forgotten Mr. Rochester, reader, amidst these changes of place and fortune. Not for a moment. His idea was still with me, because it was not a vapour sunshine could disperse, nor a sand-traced effigy storms could wash away; it was a name graven on a tablet, fated to last as long as the marble it inscribed. The craving to know what had become of him followed me everywhere; when I was at Morton, I re-entered my cottage every evening to think of that; and now at Moor House, I sought my bedroom each night to brood over it.\nIn the course of my necessary correspondence with Mr. Briggs about the will, I had inquired if he knew anything of Mr. Rochester’s present residence and state of health; but, as St. John had conjectured, he was quite ignorant of all concerning him. I then wrote to Mrs. Fairfax, entreating information on the subject. I had calculated with certainty on this step answering my end: I felt sure it would elicit an early answer. I was astonished when a fortnight passed without reply; but when two months wore away, and day after day the post arrived and brought nothing for me, I fell a prey to the keenest anxiety.\nI wrote again: there was a chance of my first letter having missed. Renewed hope followed renewed effort: it shone like the former for some weeks, then, like it, it faded, flickered: not a line, not a word reached me. When half a year wasted in vain expectancy, my hope died out, and then I felt dark indeed.",
          "paraphrase_gemini-2.5-flash-preview-04-17": "One evening, during good-night greetings, St. John kissed his sisters as was his habit, but simply gave me his hand, which was also his custom. Diana, feeling playful (as her will wasn't easily controlled by his), exclaimed, \"St. John! You call Jane your third sister, but you don't treat her that way; you should kiss her too.\" She gently pushed me towards him. I found Diana quite annoying and felt very flustered. While I was feeling this way, St. John lowered his head, bringing his face to my level. His eyes looked piercingly into mine, and he kissed me. While there's no such thing as a kiss made of marble or ice, I'd describe my cousin's kiss as belonging to one of those types. However, there might be experimental kisses, and his felt like one. After kissing me, he watched me to see my reaction. It wasn't dramatic; I definitely didn't blush. Perhaps I turned a bit pale, as the kiss felt like a symbol cementing my constraints. He never skipped this ritual afterward, and the serious, quiet way I underwent it seemed to make it appealing to him. For my part, I increasingly wanted to please him, but daily felt more and more that to do so, I had to deny a significant part of myself, suppress my abilities, change my natural interests, and force myself into pursuits I wasn't suited for. He aimed to shape me into someone far beyond what I could achieve, and aspiring to meet his standards was a constant torment. It felt as impossible as altering my irregular features to match his perfectly classical ones, or changing my shifting green eyes to the deep sea-blue and serious intensity of his. However, it wasn't only his influence that held me captive at this time. Lately, it had been easy to look sad because a corrosive anxiety was eating away at my happiness at its root: the suspense about Mr. Rochester. Perhaps you, the reader, think I had forgotten Mr. Rochester during these changes in location and fortune. Not for a moment. His presence was always with me because it wasn't a fleeting image that sunlight could dissipate, or a drawing in the sand that storms could wash away; it was a name etched onto a tablet, destined to last as long as the material it was written on. The intense desire to know what had happened to him followed me everywhere. When I was at Morton, I returned to my cottage every evening to dwell on it, and now at Moor House, I sought my bedroom each night to brood over it. In my necessary correspondence with Mr. Briggs about the will, I asked if he knew anything about Mr. Rochester’s current address and health, but, just as St. John had guessed, he was completely unaware of anything concerning him. I then wrote to Mrs. Fairfax, begging for information on the matter. I was absolutely certain this step would succeed in getting me information and felt sure I would receive a prompt reply. I was surprised when two weeks passed without a response, but when two months elapsed, and day after day the post arrived bringing nothing for me, I became consumed by the most intense anxiety. I wrote again, thinking perhaps my first letter had been lost. Renewed hope followed this renewed effort; it shone brightly for a few weeks, then, like the first attempt, it dimmed and flickered. Not a single line, not a word reached me. After half a year wasted in futile waiting, my hope died, and then I felt truly despairing.",
          "paraphrase_gpt-4.1-2025-04-14": "One night, as his sisters and I gathered around to wish him goodnight, St. John gave his sisters their usual kisses and, as was his habit, offered me his hand. Diana, in a playful mood and not easily subdued by her brother, teased him, pointing out that though he calls me his third sister, he does not treat me as one, and prompted him to kiss me too. She pushed me toward him, and I felt embarrassed and awkward. St. John then lowered his head to mine, studied my face, and kissed me. If there were such things as kisses like marble or ice, his would fit that description, though maybe it was more of a kiss for the sake of an experiment. He watched to see my reaction, but I do not think I showed much emotion—maybe I went a bit pale, because I felt like this kiss sealed my confinement with him. He never missed this ritual after that, and my calm acceptance of it seemed to add a certain appeal for him.\n\nAs for myself, I increasingly wished to please him, but doing so meant I had to deny much of who I was, repress many of my talents, and try to adopt interests that were unnatural to me. He wanted to shape me into an ideal I could never reach; striving to meet his standards was a constant strain, as hopeless as trying to change my features to match his, or my eyes to be like his.\n\nBut it was not just his authority that dominated me. Lately, I found it easy to be sad as I was plagued by the misery of uncertainty. If you think I forgot Mr. Rochester through all these changes, you are mistaken. The idea of him remained with me always, something indelible and unchangeable. My need to know his fate was ever-present; back at Morton I thought of him every night, and at Moor House it was the same.\n\nWhile dealing with correspondence about the will, I had asked Mr. Briggs if he knew anything about Mr. Rochester’s whereabouts or health, but as St. John suspected, Briggs knew nothing. I then wrote to Mrs. Fairfax, asking for news, sure she would respond quickly. When two weeks passed without an answer, I was surprised, and as months passed with no word, my anxiety grew. I wrote again, wondering if my first letter was lost, and my hope was revived for a time, but eventually, just like before, I received nothing. After six months of waiting in vain, all hope was gone and I was left in darkness."

            "One particular day, Jane's spirits were unusually low due to a poignant disappointment: Hannah had mentioned a letter for her, leading Jane to hope for news of Rochester, only to find an inconsequential business note from Mr. Briggs. This setback brought her to tears.",

          "text_segment": "A fine spring shone round me, which I could not enjoy. Summer approached; Diana tried to cheer me: she said I looked ill, and wished to accompany me to the sea-side. This St. John opposed; he said I did not want dissipation, I wanted employment; my present life was too purposeless, I required an aim; and, I suppose, by way of supplying deficiencies, he prolonged still further my lessons in Hindostanee, and grew more urgent in requiring their accomplishment: and I, like a fool, never thought of resisting him—I could not resist him.\nOne day I had come to my studies in lower spirits than usual; the ebb was occasioned by a poignantly felt disappointment. Hannah had told me in the morning there was a letter for me, and when I went down to take it, almost certain that the long-looked for tidings were vouchsafed me at last, I found only an unimportant note from Mr. Briggs on business. The bitter check had wrung from me some tears; and now, as I sat poring over the crabbed characters and flourishing tropes of an Indian scribe, my eyes filled again.\nSt. John called me to his side to read; in attempting to do this my voice failed me: words were lost in sobs. He and I were the only occupants of the parlour: Diana was practising her music in the drawing-room, Mary was gardening—it was a very fine May day, clear, sunny, and breezy. My companion expressed no surprise at this emotion, nor did he question me as to its cause; he only said—\n“We will wait a few minutes, Jane, till you are more composed.” And while I smothered the paroxysm with all haste, he sat calm and patient, leaning on his desk, and looking like a physician watching with the eye of science an expected and fully understood crisis in a patient’s malady. Having stifled my sobs, wiped my eyes, and muttered something about not being very well that morning, I resumed my task, and succeeded in completing it. St. John put away my books and his, locked his desk, and said—\n“Now, Jane, you shall take a walk; and with me.”\n“I will call Diana and Mary.”\n“No; I want only one companion this morning, and that must be you. Put on your things; go out by the kitchen-door: take the road towards the head of Marsh Glen: I will join you in a moment.”\nI know no medium: I never in my life have known any medium in my dealings with positive, hard characters, antagonistic to my own, between absolute submission and determined revolt. I have always faithfully observed the one, up to the very moment of bursting, sometimes with volcanic vehemence, into the other; and as neither present circumstances warranted, nor my present mood inclined me to mutiny, I observed careful obedience to St. John’s directions; and in ten minutes I was treading the wild track of the glen, side by side with him.\nThe breeze was from the west: it came over the hills, sweet with scents of heath and rush; the sky was of stainless blue; the stream descending the ravine, swelled with past spring rains, poured along plentiful and clear, catching golden gleams from the sun, and sapphire tints from the firmament. As we advanced and left the track, we trod a soft turf, mossy fine and emerald green, minutely enamelled with a tiny white flower, and spangled with a star-like yellow blossom: the hills, meantime, shut us quite in; for the glen, towards its head, wound to their very core.\n“Let us rest here,” said St. John, as we reached the first stragglers of a battalion of rocks, guarding a sort of pass, beyond which the beck rushed down a waterfall; and where, still a little farther, the mountain shook off turf and flower, had only heath for raiment and crag for gem—where it exaggerated the wild to the savage, and exchanged the fresh for the frowning—where it guarded the forlorn hope of solitude, and a last refuge for silence.\nI took a seat: St. John stood near me. He looked up the pass and down the hollow; his glance wandered away with the stream, and returned to traverse the unclouded heaven which coloured it: he removed his hat, let the breeze stir his hair and kiss his brow. He seemed in communion with the genius of the haunt: with his eye he bade farewell to something.\n“And I shall see it again,” he said aloud, “in dreams when I sleep by the Ganges: and again in a more remote hour—when another slumber overcomes me—on the shore of a darker stream!”\nStrange words of a strange love! An austere patriot’s passion for his fatherland! He sat down; for half-an-hour we never spoke; neither he to me nor I to him: that interval past, he recommenced—\n“Jane, I go in six weeks; I have taken my berth in an East Indiaman which sails on the 20th of June.”\n“God will protect you; for you have undertaken His work,” I answered.\n“Yes,” said he, “there is my glory and joy. I am the servant of an infallible Master. I am not going out under human guidance, subject to the defective laws and erring control of my feeble fellow-worms: my king, my lawgiver, my captain, is the All-perfect. It seems strange to me that all round me do not burn to enlist under the same banner,—to join in the same enterprise.”\n“All have not your powers, and it would be folly for the feeble to wish to march with the strong.”\n“I do not speak to the feeble, or think of them: I address only such as are worthy of the work, and competent to accomplish it.”\n“Those are few in number, and difficult to discover.”\n“You say truly; but when found, it is right to stir them up—to urge and exhort them to the effort—to show them what their gifts are, and why they were given—to speak Heaven’s message in their ear,—to offer them, direct from God, a place in the ranks of His chosen.”\n“If they are really qualified for the task, will not their own hearts be the first to inform them of it?”\nI felt as if an awful charm was framing round and gathering over me: I trembled to hear some fatal word spoken which would at once declare and rivet the spell.\n“And what does your heart say?” demanded St. John.\n“My heart is mute,—my heart is mute,” I answered, struck and thrilled.\n“Then I must speak for it,” continued the deep, relentless voice. “Jane, come with me to India: come as my helpmeet and fellow-labourer.”\nThe glen and sky spun round: the hills heaved! It was as if I had heard a summons from Heaven—as if a visionary messenger, like him of Macedonia, had enounced, “Come over and help us!” But I was no apostle,—I could not behold the herald,—I could not receive his call.\n“Oh, St. John!” I cried, “have some mercy!”\nI appealed to one who, in the discharge of what he believed his duty, knew neither mercy nor remorse. He continued—\n“God and nature intended you for a missionary’s wife. It is not personal, but mental endowments they have given you: you are formed for labour, not for love. A missionary’s wife you must—shall be. You shall be mine: I claim you—not for my pleasure, but for my Sovereign’s service.”",
          "paraphrase_gemini-2.5-flash-preview-04-17": "Even the beautiful spring weather didn't lift my spirits. As summer neared, Diana attempted to comfort me, observing my poor health and suggesting a trip to the coast. St. John disagreed, stating I needed work rather than a change of scene. He felt my life lacked direction and required a purpose. To fill this perceived gap, he intensified my Hindostanee language studies and pushed harder for me to master them. Foolishly, I found myself unable to oppose him. My mood was particularly low when I began my studies one day, brought on by a sharp disappointment. That morning, Hannah had mentioned I had a letter, and I had gone to collect it, fully expecting it to contain the crucial news I had been anticipating for so long. Instead, I found only a trivial business note from Mr. Briggs. This harsh let-down had already made me weep, and now, as I focused on the difficult Indian writing and elaborate expressions, my eyes welled up again. St. John asked me to come over and read, but when I tried, my voice gave out, swallowed by sobs. We were alone in the room; Diana was in the drawing-room practicing piano, and Mary was outside gardening on what was a beautiful, sunny, breezy May day. St. John showed no surprise at my emotional state and didn't ask why I was upset. He simply said, \"We will wait a few minutes, Jane, until you are calmer.\" While I quickly tried to control my crying fit, he remained calm and patient, leaning on his desk, observing me with the dispassionate gaze of a doctor watching a foreseen medical event in a patient’s malady. After suppressing my sobs, drying my eyes, and mumbling an excuse about not feeling well that morning, I returned to my work and completed it successfully. St. John then put away his books and mine, locked his desk, and announced, \"Now, Jane, you are going for a walk; and it will be with me.\" I suggested I fetch Diana and Mary, but he declined, saying he only desired my company that morning. He instructed me to get ready, leave through the kitchen door, and head towards the upper part of Marsh Glen, adding he would join me shortly. When dealing with strong-willed, opposing personalities, I find I have no middle ground between complete compliance and outright defiance. I have consistently practiced the former until reaching a breaking point, sometimes erupting passionately into the latter. Since neither the circumstances nor my mood prompted rebellion, I carefully followed St. John’s instructions, and within ten minutes, I was walking beside him on the wild path through the glen. The breeze blew from the west, carrying the sweet scents of heath and rush from the hills. The sky was perfectly clear and blue. The stream, swollen from recent spring rains, flowed abundantly and purely down the ravine, its water catching golden light from the sun and reflecting the sapphire colour of the sky. Leaving the main path, we walked on soft, mossy, bright green turf, dotted with tiny white flowers and sprinkled with small yellow blossoms that resembled stars. Meanwhile, the hills completely enclosed us, as the glen twisted deep into their centre towards its source. We stopped when we reached the initial scattered rocks that guarded a narrow pass where the stream turned into a waterfall. A little higher up, the mountain lost its turf and flowers, showing only rough heath and rock, transforming the wild landscape into something stark and untamed, exchanging freshness for severity. St. John suggested we rest here. I sat down, and he stood near me. He gazed up the pass and down the hollow, his eyes following the stream and then lifting to scan the clear sky reflecting in it. He took off his hat, allowing the breeze to ruffle his hair and touch his forehead. He seemed deeply connected to the spirit of the place, as if saying goodbye to something with his gaze. \"And I shall see it again,\" he said aloud, \"in dreams when I sleep by the Ganges: and again in a more distant time—when another sleep overtakes me—by a darker river!\" These were strange words reflecting a strange kind of love – an intense patriot’s feeling for his homeland. He then sat down, and we remained silent for half an hour, neither of us speaking. When the silence ended, he spoke again. \"Jane, I am leaving in six weeks; I have booked my passage on an East Indiaman ship sailing on June 20th.\" I replied, \"God will watch over you, because you are doing His work.\" He responded, \"Yes, that is my pride and happiness. I serve a perfect Master. I am not guided by people, subject to the flaws and mistakes of mere mortals; my ruler, my lawgiver, my leader, is the completely perfect being. It seems odd to me that not everyone around me is eager to join this same cause and serve under the same banner.\" I commented, \"Not everyone has your capabilities, and it would be unwise for those who are weak to try and keep pace with the strong.\" He countered, \"I am not talking about the weak, or considering them; I am only addressing those who are fit for the task and able to carry it out.\" I pointed out, \"Such people are few and hard to find.\" He agreed, \"That is true; but when they are found, it is right to motivate them—to encourage and persuade them to make the effort—to reveal their talents and their purpose—to deliver God’s message to them—to offer them, directly from God, a position among His chosen servants.\" I questioned, \"If they are truly suited for the task, wouldn't their own consciences inform them first?\" I felt a sense of dreadful enchantment taking hold of me, a spell being woven. I trembled, fearing he was about to utter some fateful word that would instantly solidify this hold over me. St. John then asked directly, \"And what does *your* heart tell you?\" \"My heart is silent,—my heart is silent,\" I responded, feeling both shocked and stirred. He continued in his deep, unyielding voice, \"Then I must speak on its behalf. Jane, come with me to India: come as my partner and colleague in the mission.\" The valley and the sky seemed to spin around me, the hills appeared to rise and fall! It felt as if I had received a divine command—as though a ghostly messenger, like the one in the Bible who appeared to Paul, had announced, \"Come across and assist us!\" But I was not an apostle; I could not perceive this messenger, nor could I accept his call. \"Oh, St. John!\" I exclaimed, pleading, \"Please have some compassion!\" I had appealed to a man who, when fulfilling what he believed to be his duty, was incapable of either mercy or regret. He pressed on. He stated that God and nature had designed me to be a missionary’s wife. He claimed my talents were intellectual, not personal, given for work, not for affection. I was meant to be—and absolutely would be—a missionary’s wife. \"You will be mine,\" he declared, \"I claim you—not for my own happiness, but for the service of my supreme Ruler.\"",
          "paraphrase_gpt-4.1-2025-04-14": "A beautiful spring was all around me, but I couldn't take any pleasure in it. As summer neared, Diana tried to lift my spirits, saying I looked unwell and suggesting a trip to the seaside together. St. John, however, disagreed. He insisted that what I needed wasn't distraction, but work. He said my life lacked direction and that I needed a purpose. To fill that void, he made my Hindostanee lessons even longer and pressured me more to meet his demands. Foolishly, I never thought to resist him—I simply couldn't.\n\nOne day, I was feeling even lower than usual because I'd suffered a sharp disappointment that morning. Hannah had told me I had a letter, and I went down, expecting important news at last, but it turned out to be just an insignificant note from Mr. Briggs about business. The letdown upset me so much that I cried. Now, as I sat over my complicated Hindostanee studies, more tears came.\n\nSt. John called me over to read, but my attempt failed; I couldn't get the words out through my sobs. We were alone in the parlor—Diana with her music in the drawing-room, Mary gardening outside. It was a clear, sunny, breezy May day. St. John didn't comment on my emotional state nor ask about it; he just said, \"We'll wait a few minutes, Jane, until you feel better.\" As I tried to get control quickly, he sat calmly, looking like a doctor calmly watching a patient's expected crisis. When I had wiped my eyes and murmured that I wasn't feeling well, I went back to my lesson and managed to finish. St. John then put away our books, locked his desk, and said, \"Now, Jane, you should go for a walk, with me.\"\n\nI offered to call Diana and Mary, but he refused—he wanted only me. He told me to get ready and head out toward the head of Marsh Glen, promising to join me shortly. I have never found a middle ground with strong-willed, contrary people; I either completely submit or finally erupt in defiance. Since the situation called for obedience, that's what I did, and soon I was walking beside St. John along the wild path through the glen.\n\nThe west wind blew gently, scented with heath and rushes over the hills, and the sky was perfectly blue. The ravine's stream, swelled by past rains, flowed clearly, glimmering in the sunshine. Off the path, we walked over soft, mossy green grass sprinkled with tiny white and yellow flowers, the hills closing around us as we went deeper into the glen.\n\n\"Let's stop here,\" St. John said as we came to some large rocks by a waterfall, beyond which the mountain became bare and wild. I sat, while he gazed up and down the valley—a pensive farewell in his expression. He took off his hat, letting the breeze move his hair, seeming to commune with the spirit of the place. \"I'll see this again,\" he spoke, \"in dreams as I sleep by the Ganges, and in a far-distant hour, when another sleep overtakes me, on the shore of a darker stream!\"\n\nThese were unusual words, the expression of a deep patriot's love for his country. He then sat, and for half an hour there was silence between us. Finally, he spoke again: \"Jane, I leave in six weeks—I have booked my passage on an East Indiaman sailing June 20th.\"\n\nI replied that God would protect him since he was undertaking God's work. He agreed, finding his pride and joy in being the servant of a perfect Master, not bound by imperfect human leadership. He wondered why everyone didn't feel compelled to join such a cause.\n\nI answered that not all have his strengths, and it would be foolish for the weak to attempt what the strong can do. St. John said he wasn't thinking of the weak, only those fit for the task, who should be urged to join the mission—they should be told what gifts they have and why, offered a place among God's chosen. I responded that if they were truly destined, their own hearts would tell them first.\n\nI felt a sense of fatefulness closing in, as if I were about to hear words that would bind me to a profound destiny. \"What does your heart say?\" St. John asked. I replied that my heart was silent. \"Then I must speak for it,\" he said firmly. \"Jane, come to India with me as my partner and fellow worker.\"\n\nThe world spun around me; it felt like a call from heaven. But I couldn't answer such a call. \"Oh, St. John! Have pity!\" I begged. But he was unrelenting, believing my fate was to be a missionary's wife—not because of love, but due to my mental abilities and suitability for labor. He insisted that I was meant for this purpose, that I must be his—not for personal reasons, but to serve a higher calling."

He encouraged her to view humility as a Christian virtue and to trust in God's ability to empower even a feeble instrument for a great task, offering his constant guidance and support in the practical aspects of the mission.",
            "Jane, however, expressed a profound lack of any inner confirmation or inspiration for such an undertaking, conveying her fear of being persuaded into a role she could not fulfill.",
            "St. John then systematically outlined his reasons for believing in her suitability, based on ten months of close observation: her diligent and capable performance at the village school despite its uncongeniality to her; her clear-headed response to newfound wealth, showing an absence of avarice; her resolute and just division of her inheritance, demonstrating a spirit that embraced sacrifice; and her tractable perseverance in learning Hindostanee at his request. He concluded by affirming her qualities of docility, diligence, disinterestedness, faithfulness, constancy, and courage, asserting her invaluable potential as a helper in India.",
            "Feeling the force of his arguments and seeing the path ahead becoming clearer, Jane requested fifteen minutes to reflect before responding.",
            "During her solitary contemplation, Jane acknowledged her practical ability to perform the duties St. John outlined, provided her life was spared, though she doubted her constitution could long endure an Indian climate. She recognized St. John's detachment from such concerns, believing he would resign her to God with serenity if she were to die.",
            "She reasoned that England, without Mr. Rochester, was an empty land for her, and that clinging to the hope of their reunion was absurd. The missionary work St. John offered seemed a noble replacement for her lost affections and hopes.",
            "Despite this logical assessment, she shuddered at the thought, recognizing that joining St. John meant abandoning a vital part of herself and likely hastening her own death.

          "text_segment": "“I am not fit for it: I have no vocation,” I said.\nHe had calculated on these first objections: he was not irritated by them. Indeed, as he leaned back against the crag behind him, folded his arms on his chest, and fixed his countenance, I saw he was prepared for a long and trying opposition, and had taken in a stock of patience to last him to its close—resolved, however, that that close should be conquest for him.\n“Humility, Jane,” said he, “is the groundwork of Christian virtues: you say right that you are not fit for the work. Who is fit for it? Or who, that ever was truly called, believed himself worthy of the summons? I, for instance, am but dust and ashes. With St. Paul, I acknowledge myself the chiefest of sinners; but I do not suffer this sense of my personal vileness to daunt me. I know my Leader: that He is just as well as mighty; and while He has chosen a feeble instrument to perform a great task, He will, from the boundless stores of His providence, supply the inadequacy of the means to the end. Think like me, Jane—trust like me. It is the Rock of Ages I ask you to lean on: do not doubt but it will bear the weight of your human weakness.”\n“I do not understand a missionary life: I have never studied missionary labours.”\n“There I, humble as I am, can give you the aid you want: I can set you your task from hour to hour; stand by you always; help you from moment to moment. This I could do in the beginning: soon (for I know your powers) you would be as strong and apt as myself, and would not require my help.”\n“But my powers—where are they for this undertaking? I do not feel them. Nothing speaks or stirs in me while you talk. I am sensible of no light kindling—no life quickening—no voice counselling or cheering. Oh, I wish I could make you see how much my mind is at this moment like a rayless dungeon, with one shrinking fear fettered in its depths—the fear of being persuaded by you to attempt what I cannot accomplish!”\n“I have an answer for you—hear it. I have watched you ever since we first met: I have made you my study for ten months. I have proved you in that time by sundry tests: and what have I seen and elicited? In the village school I found you could perform well, punctually, uprightly, labour uncongenial to your habits and inclinations; I saw you could perform it with capacity and tact: you could win while you controlled. In the calm with which you learnt you had become suddenly rich, I read a mind clear of the vice of Demas:—lucre had no undue power over you. In the resolute readiness with which you cut your wealth into four shares, keeping but one to yourself, and relinquishing the three others to the claim of abstract justice, I recognised a soul that revelled in the flame and excitement of sacrifice. In the tractability with which, at my wish, you forsook a study in which you were interested, and adopted another because it interested me; in the untiring assiduity with which you have since persevered in it—in the unflagging energy and unshaken temper with which you have met its difficulties—I acknowledge the complement of the qualities I seek. Jane, you are docile, diligent, disinterested, faithful, constant, and courageous; very gentle, and very heroic: cease to mistrust yourself—I can trust you unreservedly. As a conductress of Indian schools, and a helper amongst Indian women, your assistance will be to me invaluable.”\nMy iron shroud contracted round me; persuasion advanced with slow sure step. Shut my eyes as I would, these last words of his succeeded in making the way, which had seemed blocked up, comparatively clear. My work, which had appeared so vague, so hopelessly diffuse, condensed itself as he proceeded, and assumed a definite form under his shaping hand. He waited for an answer. I demanded a quarter of an hour to think, before I again hazarded a reply.\n“Very willingly,” he rejoined; and rising, he strode a little distance up the pass, threw himself down on a swell of heath, and there lay still.\n“I can do what he wants me to do: I am forced to see and acknowledge that,” I meditated,—“that is, if life be spared me. But I feel mine is not the existence to be long protracted under an Indian sun. What then? He does not care for that: when my time came to die, he would resign me, in all serenity and sanctity, to the God who gave me. The case is very plain before me. In leaving England, I should leave a loved but empty land—Mr. Rochester is not there; and if he were, what is, what can that ever be to me? My business is to live without him now: nothing so absurd, so weak as to drag on from day to day, as if I were waiting some impossible change in circumstances, which might reunite me to him. Of course (as St. John once said) I must seek another interest in life to replace the one lost: is not the occupation he now offers me truly the most glorious man can adopt or God assign? Is it not, by its noble cares and sublime results, the one best calculated to fill the void left by uptorn affections and demolished hopes? I believe I must say, Yes—and yet I shudder. Alas! If I join St. John, I abandon half myself: if I go to India, I go to premature death. And how will the interval between leaving England for India, and India for the grave, be filled? Oh, I know well! That, too, is very clear to my vision. By straining to satisfy St. John till my sinews ache, I shall satisfy him—to the finest central point and farthest outward circle of his expectations. If I do go with him—if I do make the sacrifice he urges, I will make it absolutely: I will throw all on the altar—heart, vitals, the entire victim. He will never love me; but he shall approve me; I will show him energies he has not yet seen, resources he has never suspected. Yes, I can work as hard as he can, and with as little grudging.\n“Consent, then, to his demand is possible: but for one item—one dreadful item. It is—that he asks me to be his wife, and has no more of a husband’s heart for me than that frowning giant of a rock, down which the stream is foaming in yonder gorge. He prizes me as a soldier would a good weapon; and that is all. Unmarried to him, this would never grieve me; but can I let him complete his calculations—coolly put into practice his plans—go through the wedding ceremony? Can I receive from him the bridal ring, endure all the forms of love (which I doubt not he would scrupulously observe) and know that the spirit was quite absent? Can I bear the consciousness that every endearment he bestows is a sacrifice made on principle? No: such a martyrdom would be monstrous. I will never undergo it. As his sister, I might accompany him—not as his wife: I will tell him so.”",
          "paraphrase_gemini-2.5-flash-preview-04-17": "Jane replied that she was not suitable for the work and felt she lacked the necessary calling. St. John had anticipated these initial objections and was not bothered by them. Leaning back against the rock with folded arms and a steady expression, Jane saw he was prepared for a prolonged and difficult argument, fully stocked with patience, but determined to win in the end. St. John began by explaining that humility was the foundation of Christian virtues, agreeing that she was right about not being fit, but adding that no one truly is, and no one who is genuinely called feels worthy. He included himself in this, stating he was but 'dust and ashes' and the 'chiefest of sinners,' but that this awareness of his own flaws did not discourage him. He knew his 'Leader' was both just and powerful and would provide the necessary means from His providence, having chosen a weak instrument for a great task. He urged Jane to think and trust as he did, advising her to lean on 'the Rock of Ages,' which would undoubtedly support her human weaknesses. Jane responded that she didn't understand missionary life or the work involved. St. John offered his help, promising to guide her hour by hour, always be present, and assist her moment to moment in the beginning. He added that, knowing her abilities, she would soon become as capable as himself and wouldn't need his assistance. Jane countered, asking where these abilities were for such an undertaking, stating she didn't feel them. She described her mind as dark and uninspired ('like a rayless dungeon'), lacking any inner light, vitality, or guiding voice. She expressed a deep fear of being convinced to attempt something she couldn't achieve. St. John then explained that he had watched and studied her for ten months, testing her character. He had observed her efficiently, punctually, and honestly performing the uncongenial work at the village school, noting her skill and tact, and her ability to command respect while also being liked. He recognized in her calmness upon becoming wealthy that she was free from greed and that her decisive act of dividing her fortune, keeping only a quarter and giving the rest away out of a sense of justice, revealed a spirit that embraced sacrifice. Her willingness to abandon her studies for his and her subsequent persistent, diligent, energetic, and steadfast efforts in his interests convinced him she possessed the qualities he sought. He listed her virtues: 'docile, diligent, disinterested, faithful, constant, and courageous; very gentle, and very heroic.' He urged her to stop doubting herself, as he trusted her completely, stating her help as a leader in Indian schools and amongst Indian women would be invaluable to him. Jane felt increasingly trapped ('iron shroud contracted') by his steady persuasion. Despite her efforts to resist, his last words clarified the task, which had previously seemed vague and impossible, condensing it into a definite form under his guidance. As he waited for an answer, she requested fifteen minutes to think before replying again. He readily agreed, rising to walk a short distance up the pass, where he lay down still on a patch of heather. Jane reflected that she was forced to admit she could do what he wanted, assuming she remained alive. However, she felt she wouldn't survive long in the Indian climate. She mused that this didn't concern him; he would calmly and devoutly accept her death when it came. The situation seemed clear: leaving England meant leaving a beloved but empty place without Mr. Rochester, and even if he were there, he could no longer be anything to her. Her task now was to live without him, recognizing the futility of waiting for an impossible reunion. She needed a new purpose, as St. John had suggested, and considered if the missionary work was the noblest possible calling, the best way to fill the void left by her lost affections and hopes. She felt she should agree, but the thought made her shudder. She lamented that joining St. John meant sacrificing a part of herself, and going to India felt like heading towards a premature death. She knew exactly how the time between leaving England and dying in India would be spent: relentlessly striving to meet St. John's every expectation. If she went and made the sacrifice he demanded, she would do it completely, giving her entire being. She accepted he would never love her but resolved to earn his approval by demonstrating unsuspected energy and capability, working as hard and willingly as he did. She concluded that consenting to his mission was possible, except for one terrible condition: his request for marriage. She saw that he had no more a husband's heart for her than the formidable rock face, viewing her only as a valuable tool ('as a soldier would a good weapon'). This wouldn't be painful if they weren't marrying, but she couldn't bear to let him coldly execute his plan, go through the wedding ceremony, accept a ring, and endure empty gestures of love, knowing his affection was merely a calculated sacrifice. Such a 'monstrous martyrdom' was unbearable. She decided she would never agree to marry him, resolving to offer to accompany him as a sister instead.",

Leaning back against the rocks, with his arms folded, he looked prepared for a long argument, determined to win eventually. He said, \"Humility is at the core of Christian virtues, Jane. You are right to feel unworthy—no one truly called to such work sees themselves as fit. Like St. Paul, I know I am full of faults, but that doesn't stop me. I trust my Leader—He is just and powerful—and if He has chosen a weak person for a great task, He will make up the difference. Trust as I do; you can rely on God to support your human frailty.\" I replied that I didn't understand what being a missionary involved or what such work required. He assured me he could guide me every step at first, and then, knowing my abilities, I would soon be independent and able as he was. I protested that I felt no inspiration or capability for this task and admitted I was afraid he might convince me to try something I couldn't actually do. He responded that he'd observed and tested me for months—from my work at the village school, my selflessness with newfound wealth, my willingness to change studies for his sake, and my perseverance. He saw in me the qualities he needed: diligence, selflessness, consistency, courage, and more. He trusted me fully and said I would be essential to his mission in India. I felt increasingly pressured and realized his arguments gave the journey shape and direction. I asked for fifteen minutes to decide, and he agreed, moving away to wait. Reflecting, I admitted I could do the work if my health held, but I doubted I'd survive long in India. He, I knew, would accept my death as God's will. If I went, I'd leave behind England, where I no longer had hope with Mr. Rochester, and needed a new purpose in life; this mission, though daunting, might be it. Yet, joining St. John meant giving up part of myself, and likely, my life. I knew I'd work hard and meet all his expectations, but the main obstacle remained: he wanted me as a wife, yet didn't love me, only valuing me as a useful partner. If I wasn't to marry him, such a partnership wouldn't trouble me, but I couldn't bear to go through the motions of marriage without feeling loved. Enduring a loveless marriage would be unbearable. I resolved that I could go as his sister, but not as his wife, and decided to tell him so."

If you were my real sister it would be different: I should take you, and seek no wife. But as it is, either our union must be consecrated and sealed by marriage, or it cannot exist: practical obstacles oppose themselves to any other plan. Do you not see it, Jane? Consider a moment—your strong sense will guide you.”\nI did consider; and still my sense, such as it was, directed me only to the fact that we did not love each other as man and wife should: and therefore it inferred we ought not to marry. I said so. “St. John,” I returned, “I regard you as a brother—you, me as a sister: so let us continue.”\n“We cannot—we cannot,” he answered, with short, sharp determination: “it would not do. You have said you will go with me to India: remember—you have said that.”\n“Conditionally.”\n“Well—well. To the main point—the departure with me from England, the co-operation with me in my future labours—you do not object. You have already as good as put your hand to the plough: you are too consistent to withdraw it. You have but one end to keep in view—how the work you have undertaken can best be done. Simplify your complicated interests, feelings, thoughts, wishes, aims; merge all considerations in one purpose: that of fulfilling with effect—with power—the mission of your great Master. To do so, you must have a coadjutor: not a brother—that is a loose tie—but a husband. I, too, do not want a sister: a sister might any day be taken from me. I want a wife: the sole helpmeet I can influence efficiently in life, and retain absolutely till death.”\nI shuddered as he spoke: I felt his influence in my marrow—his hold on my limbs.\n“Seek one elsewhere than in me, St. John: seek one fitted to you.”\n“One fitted to my purpose, you mean—fitted to my vocation. Again I tell you it is not the insignificant private individual—the mere man, with the man’s selfish senses—I wish to mate: it is the missionary.”\n“And I will give the missionary my energies—it is all he wants—but not myself: that would be only adding the husk and shell to the kernel. For them he has no use: I retain them.”\n“You cannot—you ought not. Do you think God will be satisfied with half an oblation? Will He accept a mutilated sacrifice? It is the cause of God I advocate: it is under His standard I enlist you. I cannot accept on His behalf a divided allegiance: it must be entire.”\n“Oh!

He quickly stood up and approached me. I stated my readiness to travel to India, provided I could do so independently. He responded that my answer was unclear and required elaboration. I clarified that, having been like adopted siblings so far, we should maintain that relationship and not marry. He disagreed, saying adopted kinship was insufficient in this context. He explained that if I were his biological sister, the situation would differ, and he would take me without seeking a wife. However, as things stood, our connection must be formalized and confirmed through marriage, or it could not exist, as practical issues prevented any other arrangement. He asked if I understood, appealing to my good judgment. I reflected on this, and my sense, such as it was, simply affirmed that we lacked the mutual love necessary for a husband and wife, concluding therefore that we should not marry. I told him this, repeating, \"St. John, I consider you a brother, and you consider me a sister; let's keep it that way.\" He emphatically replied, \"We cannot; we cannot! It would not work. You agreed to accompany me to India; remember that.\" I qualified my agreement, saying it was conditional. He brushed this aside, focusing on the main point: my lack of objection to leaving England with him and assisting in his future work. He argued I had effectively committed myself and was too consistent to retract. He insisted I should focus solely on how best to accomplish the task we had undertaken. He urged me to simplify my complex feelings, thoughts, wishes, and goals, concentrating everything on the single objective of fulfilling God's mission effectively and powerfully. To do this, he explained, he needed a collaborator, not a brother, as that bond was too weak. He added that he didn't need a sister either, as she could be taken from him any day. He needed a wife, the only helper he could truly influence during life and keep absolutely until death. I trembled as he spoke, feeling his powerful influence and control over me. I pleaded with him, \"Find someone else, St. John, someone suitable for you.\" He corrected me, saying he meant someone suited to his purpose and calling. He reiterated that he didn't wish to unite himself with an insignificant private individual, a mere man with selfish human desires, but with the missionary. I countered that I would contribute my energy to the missionary's cause, as that was all he required, but I would not give myself entirely, comparing that to adding only the 'husk and shell' to the 'kernel,' which he wouldn't use, and I would keep. He argued against this, using religious terms, asking if God would accept a partial or incomplete offering.

It’d be different if you were my actual sister; I would stay with you and not seek a wife. But since you are not, the only way for us to be united must be through marriage—otherwise, we cannot be together. Any other arrangement faces real obstacles. Don’t you see that, Jane?

Again, it isn’t just an ordinary man who needs a wife—it’s the missionary in me.\" I responded, \"I’ll dedicate my energy to the missionary cause, that’s what matters, but I cannot give myself—I’d be offering only the outer part, not the essence. You have no need for those, so I’ll keep them.\" He argued, \"That’s not right. Do you think God is satisfied with a partial sacrifice? Will He accept something incomplete?

I trust, Jane, you are in earnest when you say you will serve your heart to God: it is all I want. Once wrench your heart from man, and fix it on your Maker, the advancement of that Maker’s spiritual kingdom on earth will be your chief delight and endeavour; you will be ready to do at once whatever furthers that end. You will see what impetus would be given to your efforts and mine by our physical and mental union in marriage: the only union that gives a character of permanent conformity to the destinies and designs of human beings; and, passing over all minor caprices—all trivial difficulties and delicacies of feeling—all scruple about the degree, kind, strength or tenderness of mere personal inclination—you will hasten to enter into that union at once.”\n“Shall I?” I said briefly; and I looked at his features, beautiful in their harmony, but strangely formidable in their still severity; at his brow, commanding but not open; at his eyes, bright and deep and searching, but never soft; at his tall imposing figure; and fancied myself in idea his wife. Oh! it would never do! As his curate, his comrade, all would be right: I would cross oceans with him in that capacity; toil under Eastern suns, in Asian deserts with him in that office; admire and emulate his courage and devotion and vigour; accommodate quietly to his masterhood; smile undisturbed at his ineradicable ambition; discriminate the Christian from the man: profoundly esteem the one, and freely forgive the other. I should suffer often, no doubt, attached to him only in this capacity: my body would be under rather a stringent yoke, but my heart and mind would be free. I should still have my unblighted self to turn to: my natural unenslaved feelings with which to communicate in moments of loneliness. There would be recesses in my mind which would be only mine, to which he never came, and sentiments growing there fresh and sheltered which his austerity could never blight, nor his measured warrior-march trample down: but as his wife—at his side always, and always restrained, and always checked—forced to keep the fire of my nature continually low, to compel it to burn inwardly and never utter a cry, though the imprisoned flame consumed vital after vital—this would be unendurable.\n“St. John!” I exclaimed, when I had got so far in my meditation.\n“Well?” he answered icily.\n“I repeat I freely consent to go with you as your fellow-missionary, but not as your wife; I cannot marry you and become part of you.”\n“A part of me you must become,” he answered steadily; “otherwise the whole bargain is void. How can I, a man not yet thirty, take out with me to India a girl of nineteen, unless she be married to me? How can we be for ever together—sometimes in solitudes, sometimes amidst savage tribes—and unwed?”\n“Very well,” I said shortly; “under the circumstances, quite as well as if I were either your real sister, or a man and a clergyman like yourself.”\n“It is known that you are not my sister; I cannot introduce you as such: to attempt it would be to fasten injurious suspicions on us both. And for the rest, though you have a man’s vigorous brain, you have a woman’s heart and—it would not do.”\n“It would do,” I affirmed with some disdain, “perfectly well. I have a woman’s heart, but not where you are concerned; for you I have only a comrade’s constancy; a fellow-soldier’s frankness, fidelity, fraternity, if you like; a neophyte’s respect and submission to his hierophant: nothing more—don’t fear.”\n“It is what I want,” he said, speaking to himself; “it is just what I want. And there are obstacles in the way: they must be hewn down. Jane, you would not repent marrying me—be certain of that; we must be married. I repeat it: there is no other way; and undoubtedly enough of love would follow upon marriage to render the union right even in your eyes.”\n“I scorn your idea of love,” I could not help saying, as I rose up and stood before him, leaning my back against the rock. “I scorn the counterfeit sentiment you offer: yes, St. John, and I scorn you when you offer it.”\nHe looked at me fixedly, compressing his well-cut lips while he did so. Whether he was incensed or surprised, or what, it was not easy to tell: he could command his countenance thoroughly.\n“I scarcely expected to hear that expression from you,” he said: “I think I have done and uttered nothing to deserve scorn.”\nI was touched by his gentle tone, and overawed by his high, calm mien.\n“Forgive me the words, St. John; but it is your own fault that I have been roused to speak so unguardedly. You have introduced a topic on which our natures are at variance—a topic we should never discuss: the very name of love is an apple of discord between us. If the reality were required, what should we do? How should we feel? My dear cousin, abandon your scheme of marriage—forget it.”\n“No,” said he; “it is a long-cherished scheme, and the only one which can secure my great end: but I shall urge you no further at present. To-morrow, I leave home for Cambridge: I have many friends there to whom I should wish to say farewell. I shall be absent a fortnight—take that space of time to consider my offer: and do not forget that if you reject it, it is not me you deny, but God. Through my means, He opens to you a noble career; as my wife only can you enter upon it. Refuse to be my wife, and you limit yourself for ever to a track of selfish ease and barren obscurity. Tremble lest in that case you should be numbered with those who have denied the faith, and are worse than infidels!”\nHe had done. Turning from me, he once more\n“Looked to river, looked to hill.”\nBut this time his feelings were all pent in his heart: I was not worthy to hear them uttered. As I walked by his side homeward, I read well in his iron silence all he felt towards me: the disappointment of an austere and despotic nature, which has met resistance where it expected submission—the disapprobation of a cool, inflexible judgment, which has detected in another feelings and views in which it has no power to sympathise: in short, as a man, he would have wished to coerce me into obedience: it was only as a sincere Christian he bore so patiently with my perversity, and allowed so long a space for reflection and repentance.\nThat night, after he had kissed his sisters, he thought proper to forget even to shake hands with me, but left the room in silence. I—who, though I had no love, had much friendship for him—was hurt by the marked omission: so much hurt that tears started to my eyes.\n“I see you and St. John have been quarrelling, Jane,” said Diana, “during your walk on the moor. But go after him; he is now lingering in the passage expecting you—he will make it up.”\nI have not much pride under such circumstances: I would always rather be happy than dignified; and I ran after him—he stood at the foot of the stairs.\n“Good-night, St. John,” said I.\n“Good-night, Jane,” he replied calmly.\n“Then shake hands,” I added.\nWhat a cold, loose touch, he impressed on my fingers! He was deeply displeased by what had occurred that day; cordiality would not warm, nor tears move him. No happy reconciliation was to be had with him—no cheering smile or generous word: but still the Christian was patient and placid; and when I asked him if he forgave me, he answered that he was not in the habit of cherishing the remembrance of vexation; that he had nothing to forgive, not having been offended.\nAnd with that answer he left me. I would much rather he had knocked me down.",

Until this moment, my fear of St. John was silent because I didn't understand him. He had held me in respectful awe because he had been uncertain about me. Before now, I couldn't tell how much of him was genuinely saintly and how much was merely human; but during this conversation, things were becoming clear. His true nature was being revealed before my eyes. I saw his flaws and understood them. I realized that sitting there on the heath bank, with his handsome figure in front of me, I was in the presence of a man who was as imperfect as I was. The barrier created by his harshness and authoritarianism disappeared. Having recognized these qualities in him, I saw his imperfections and felt emboldened. I was dealing with an equal—someone I could argue with—someone I could even oppose if I thought it right.",
          "paraphrase_gpt-4.1-2025-04-14": "I cannot promise, reader, that my previous words and emotions lacked a hint of concealed sarcasm. Until now, I had felt a cautious fear of St. John, which came from not understanding him. He intimidated me because he kept me uncertain. Previously, I could not decipher how much he was a saint and how much a fallible person; but as we conversed, his nature was becoming clearer to me. I saw his flaws and understood them. I realized that, sitting with him on the heath, before this striking figure, I was actually facing a man as prone to fault as myself. The façade of his rigidity and authoritarianism faded. Having sensed these traits in him, I acknowledged his imperfection and found the courage to see myself as his equal—someone who could argue or resist him if I chose. After I spoke, he was quiet for a moment, so I risked looking at his face. His gaze, bent on me, was sternly surprised and probing, as if to ask, “Is she being sarcastic towards me? What does this mean?”\n\nHe broke the silence, reminding me gravely that the matter was serious, not to be treated lightly, and hoped that I was sincere in wanting to dedicate my heart to God. That, he said, was all he wanted; once I redirected my heart away from human attachments to my Creator, the advancement of God's spiritual cause on earth would become my chief joy and goal, and I would be eager to do whatever helped that purpose. He insisted that a marriage between us would provide the essential foundation for such a mission, creating a lasting alignment of purpose, and that I should set aside minor feelings or uncertainties and hasten to accept the union.\n\nI replied briefly, studying his face—handsome but intimidating in its unyielding calm, with a commanding brow, perceptive yet unsympathetic eyes, and an imposing figure—and imagined myself as his wife. I concluded that such a role would not suit me. As his assistant and companion, I could work alongside him cheerfully; I would traverse great distances, endure hardships, and admire his courage and energy, accommodating myself to his authority, tolerating his relentless ambition, distinguishing between the devout Christian and the man, esteeming one and forgiving the other. I knew that even as his partner in work, I would sometimes suffer, obeying him outwardly, but my inner self and feelings would remain free and untouched. There would be spaces of my mind he could never reach. However, as his wife—constantly at his side, always restrained—forced to suppress my true nature and keep my feelings hidden, the experience would be intolerable.\n\n\"St. John!\" I cried, when I had reached this conclusion in my thoughts.\n\n\"Well?\" he responded coolly.\n\nI reiterated that I would gladly go with him as a fellow missionary, not as his wife; I could not marry and become merged with him.\n\nHe insisted that becoming a part of him through marriage was essential—otherwise, there could be no agreement. He could not, as a relatively young man, take a nineteen-year-old girl to India without her being his wife, nor could they live and travel together unwed.\n\nI replied, somewhat curtly, that under such circumstances, it would be as acceptable as if I were his real sister, or a fellow male clergyman.\n\nHe pointed out that people knew I was not his sister, and he could not claim otherwise; trying to do so would bring harmful suspicion on both of us. And though I had the mind of a man, I had a woman's heart, and that would be a problem.\n\nI answered dismissively that, when it came to him, I only felt a comrade's loyalty and honesty, a fellow-soldier's bond, and a student’s respect for a mentor—nothing more, so he should not worry.\n\nHe muttered to himself that this was what he wanted, but saw obstacles that needed to be dealt with. He was certain I would not regret marrying him, and insisted it must happen; he said enough love would follow to make the marriage proper.\n\nI told him bluntly that I despised the type of love he offered, calling it false sentiment, and admitted I despised him for offering it. He looked at me with compressed lips, controlling his expression so that I could not tell whether he was angry or surprised.\n\nHe responded gently, saying he did not expect such words from me and did not believe he had done anything to deserve such scorn.\n\nMoved by his mildness and composure, I apologized, blaming him for provoking me; our natures were too different to discuss love, as it was a source of discord between us. I urged him to give up the idea of marrying me.\n\nHe refused, saying it was a plan he had long cherished and the only route to achieving his goal; but he would not press the matter further for now. He was leaving for Cambridge the next day to say farewell to friends. He asked me to use the time while he was away to reconsider, warning that if I refused, it would be not just him but God I would reject. Only as his wife, he said, could I follow the noble path being offered; if I refused, I would remain in selfish comfort and obscurity, perhaps even count among those who deny the faith.\n\nHe left me then, turning away to look at the landscape, tightly controlling his emotions. As I walked home with him, I could sense his disappointment and disapproval—he was frustrated by my resistance when he expected submission and, as a man, likely wished he could bend me to his will; only his Christian values allowed him to be so patient and grant me time to reflect.\n\nThat night, after he had kissed his sisters, he refused even to shake my hand, leaving the room without a word. Although I lacked romantic love for him, I did esteem him as a friend, and his coldness hurt me deeply.\n\nDiana observed that it seemed we had argued during our walk and encouraged me to reconcile with him; he was waiting in the hallway. Lacking pride in such moments and preferring happiness to dignity, I ran after him, finding him at the bottom of the stairs.\n\n\"Good-night, St. John,\" I said.\n\n\"Good-night, Jane,\" he replied calmly.\n\nI requested a handshake; his touch was cold and indifferent, betraying his displeasure—he could not be warmed by kindness or moved by emotion. There would be no happy reconciliation, but he remained calm and patient. When I asked if he forgave me, he answered that he did not hold onto annoyance and had nothing to forgive. With this response, he left me, and I almost wished he had responded with anger instead."

He deferred his departure a whole week, and during that time he made me feel what severe punishment a good yet stern, a conscientious yet implacable man can inflict on one who has offended him. Without one overt act of hostility, one upbraiding word, he contrived to impress me momently with the conviction that I was put beyond the pale of his favour.\nNot that St. John harboured a spirit of unchristian vindictiveness—not that he would have injured a hair of my head, if it had been fully in his power to do so. Both by nature and principle, he was superior to the mean gratification of vengeance: he had forgiven me for saying I scorned him and his love, but he had not forgotten the words; and as long as he and I lived he never would forget them. I saw by his look, when he turned to me, that they were always written on the air between me and him; whenever I spoke, they sounded in my voice to his ear, and their echo toned every answer he gave me.\nHe did not abstain from conversing with me: he even called me as usual each morning to join him at his desk; and I fear the corrupt man within him had a pleasure unimparted to, and unshared by, the pure Christian, in evincing with what skill he could, while acting and speaking apparently just as usual, extract from every deed and every phrase the spirit of interest and approval which had formerly communicated a certain austere charm to his language and manner. To me, he was in reality become no longer flesh, but marble; his eye was a cold, bright, blue gem; his tongue a speaking instrument—nothing more.\nAll this was torture to me—refined, lingering torture. It kept up a slow fire of indignation and a trembling trouble of grief, which harassed and crushed me altogether. I felt how—if I were his wife, this good man, pure as the deep sunless source, could soon kill me, without drawing from my veins a single drop of blood, or receiving on his own crystal conscience the faintest stain of crime. Especially I felt this when I made any attempt to propitiate him. No ruth met my ruth. He experienced no suffering from estrangement—no yearning after reconciliation; and though, more than once, my fast falling tears blistered the page over which we both bent, they produced no more effect on him than if his heart had been really a matter of stone or metal. To his sisters, meantime, he was somewhat kinder than usual: as if afraid that mere coldness would not sufficiently convince me how completely I was banished and banned, he added the force of contrast; and this I am sure he did not by malice, but on principle.\n",
          "paraphrase_gemini-2.5-flash-preview-04-17": "St. John delayed his scheduled departure for Cambridge, remaining for an entire week. During this period, he demonstrated the profound emotional distress that a virtuous but unyielding, principled yet inflexible individual can inflict upon someone who has offended them. Without resorting to open hostility or a single critical word, he managed to continuously impress upon me the certainty that I was completely excluded from his favor. This was not because St. John possessed an un-Christian desire for vengeance or would have harmed me physically had he the power. Both his character and beliefs elevated him above the petty satisfaction of retaliation. He had forgiven me for saying I scorned him and his feelings, but he had not forgotten my words, and he would never forget them as long as we both lived. I could see in his gaze when he looked at me that they were perpetually present between us; whenever I spoke, those words seemed to echo in my voice to his ears, and their reverberation colored every response he gave me. He did not cease speaking with me; he even maintained our routine of calling me to join him at his desk each morning. I suspect that a less pure, possibly flawed, part of his nature found a hidden pleasure, unshared by his pure Christian self, in displaying the skill with which he could, while acting and speaking seemingly as usual, remove all warmth of interest and approval from every action and word – a warmth that had previously given his manner a certain reserved appeal. To me, he felt no longer human, but like cold stone; his eye was a frigid, sparkling blue jewel, and his tongue merely an instrument for speech, nothing more. This entire experience was agonizing – a subtle, drawn-out torment. It fueled a slow-burning resentment and a painful, trembling sorrow that overwhelmed and crushed me. I understood how, if I were married to him, this good man, pure as a hidden spring, could quickly destroy me emotionally without shedding a drop of my blood or staining his clear conscience with the slightest sense of wrongdoing. This feeling was particularly strong when I attempted to make amends. My suffering met with no compassion from him. He showed no distress over our estrangement and no desire for reconciliation. And although, on more than one occasion, my rapidly falling tears marked the page we were both leaning over, they had no more impact on him than if his heart were literally made of rock or metal. Meanwhile, he was notably kinder to his sisters than usual. As if concerned that mere coldness wouldn't adequately convey how completely I was banished and excluded, he emphasized this by contrast, and I am certain he did this based on principle, not malice.",

He was naturally and morally above petty vengeance; although he had forgiven my rejection of him and his love, he could not forget those words, and I knew he never would. His eyes told me the memory lingered between us, coloring every exchange and shaping his responses regardless of what I said.\n\nHe did not avoid conversation with me; every morning he invited me as usual to his desk. Yet I suspected a part of him, less than pure, took pleasure in demonstrating how skillfully he could behave normally while simultaneously withdrawing every sign of interest or approval that once gave his demeanor a dignified appeal. To me, he seemed transformed from a man of flesh to one of stone—his gaze icy, his speech mechanical.\n\nThis quiet coldness mortified me; it tormented me slowly and left me overwhelmed with grief and frustration. I realized that, had I been his wife, his goodness—so pure, yet so unyielding—could destroy me without physical harm or a blemish on his conscience. This was especially clear whenever I tried to reconcile with him. My efforts were met with no compassion; he did not seem to suffer from our estrangement or long for a repair in our relationship. Even as my tears fell onto our shared work, they left him unmoved, as though he truly had a heart of stone or metal. Meanwhile, he treated his sisters more kindly than normal, as if to show—by contrast with his treatment toward me—just how thoroughly I was cast out. I believe he did this not out of spite, but because it was his chosen, principled course of action."

What! do you not go to India?”\n“You said I could not unless I married you.”\n“And you will not marry me! You adhere to that resolution?”\nReader, do you know, as I do, what terror those cold people can put into the ice of their questions? How much of the fall of the avalanche is in their anger? of the breaking up of the frozen sea in their displeasure?\n“No. St. John, I will not marry you. I adhere to my resolution.”\nThe avalanche had shaken and slid a little forward, but it did not yet crash down.\n“Once more, why this refusal?” he asked.\n“Formerly,” I answered, “because you did not love me; now, I reply, because you almost hate me. If I were to marry you, you would kill me. You are killing me now.”\nHis lips and cheeks turned white—quite white.\n“I should kill you—I am killing you? Your words are such as ought not to be used: violent, unfeminine, and untrue. They betray an unfortunate state of mind: they merit severe reproof: they would seem inexcusable, but that it is the duty of man to forgive his fellow even until seventy-and-seven times.”\nI had finished the business now. While earnestly wishing to erase from his mind the trace of my former offence, I had stamped on that tenacious surface another and far deeper impression: I had burnt it in.\n“Now you will indeed hate me,” I said. “It is useless to attempt to conciliate you: I see I have made an eternal enemy of you.”\nA fresh wrong did these words inflict: the worse, because they touched on the truth. That bloodless lip quivered to a temporary spasm. I knew the steely ire I had whetted. I was heart-wrung.\n“You utterly misinterpret my words,” I said, at once seizing his hand: “I have no intention to grieve or pain you—indeed, I have not.”\nMost bitterly he smiled—most decidedly he withdrew his hand from mine. “And now you recall your promise, and will not go to India at all, I presume?” said he, after a considerable pause.",

Are you holding firm to that decision?” I asked the reader if they knew, as I did, the chilling effect those cold individuals could impose through their questions, how much the force of an avalanche was in their anger, and the shattering power of a frozen sea breaking up was in their displeasure. I replied, “No, St. John, I will not marry you. I am sticking to my decision.” His anger, like an avalanche, had stirred and shifted slightly forward, but had not yet fully descended. “Explain your refusal once more?” he demanded. I answered, “Previously, it was because you did not love me; now, I state, it is because you practically despise me. Marrying you would destroy me. You are destroying me already.” His lips and cheeks turned completely white. He retorted, “‘I should kill you—I am killing you?’ Your words are unfit for use: they are aggressive, unfeminine, and untrue. They indicate an unfortunate mental state and deserve harsh criticism. They might seem unforgivable, were it not a person’s duty to forgive their fellow human being countless times.” I felt I had sealed my fate. While fervently wishing to remove the lingering effect of my earlier offense from his stubborn mind, I had instead left a new, much deeper mark there; I had etched it in. “Now you truly will hate me,” I said. “There’s no use trying to appease you; I see I have made you my lifelong enemy.” These words inflicted fresh pain, made worse because they contained truth. His pale lip trembled briefly with a spasm. I knew I had sharpened his cold fury, and I was deeply pained. Instantly taking his hand, I said, “You are entirely misinterpreting my words. I have absolutely no intention of causing you distress or pain.” He smiled with great bitterness and definitively pulled his hand away from mine.

My decision hasn’t changed.”\nHis anger was mounting, but hadn’t totally burst forth.\n“Again, why are you refusing?” he pressed.\n“In the past,” I said, “it was because you didn’t love me; now, it’s because I sense that you nearly hate me. Marrying you would destroy me. You’re destroying me now.”\nHe blanched, his lips and cheeks turning pale.\n“I would destroy you—I’m destroying you? You shouldn’t use such words; they’re harsh, improper, and false. They show a disturbed mind and deserve criticism. They would be unforgivable if it weren’t a man’s duty to forgive others endlessly.”\nI had finished what I needed to do.

His pale lips quivered with emotion; I recognized the anger I’d provoked and felt great pain.\n“You’re misunderstanding me,” I said, grabbing his hand. “I never meant to upset or hurt you—truly, I didn’t.”\nHe smiled bitterly and firmly withdrew his hand from mine.

He believed his previous explanation had been clear enough to prevent me from mentioning the idea again and expressed regret that I had, for my own benefit.

I am sure there is something the matter. Tell me what business St. John and you have on hands. I have watched you this half hour from the window; you must forgive my being such a spy, but for a long time I have fancied I hardly know what. St. John is a strange being—”\nShe paused—I did not speak: soon she resumed—\n“That brother of mine cherishes peculiar views of some sort respecting you, I am sure: he has long distinguished you by a notice and interest he never showed to any one else—to what end? I wish he loved you—does he, Jane?”\nI put her cool hand to my hot forehead; “No, Die, not one whit.”\n“Then why does he follow you so with his eyes, and get you so frequently alone with him, and keep you so continually at his side? Mary and I had both concluded he wished you to marry him.”\n“He does—he has asked me to be his wife.”\nDiana clapped her hands. “That is just what we hoped and thought! And you will marry him, Jane, won’t you? And then he will stay in England.”\n“Far from that, Diana; his sole idea in proposing to me is to procure a fitting fellow-labourer in his Indian toils.”\n“What! He wishes you to go to India?”\n“Yes.”\n“Madness!” she exclaimed. “You would not live three months there, I am certain. You never shall go: you have not consented, have you, Jane?”\n“I have refused to marry him—”\n“And have consequently displeased him?” she suggested.\n“Deeply: he will never forgive me, I fear: yet I offered to accompany him as his sister.”\n“It was frantic folly to do so, Jane. Think of the task you undertook—one of incessant fatigue, where fatigue kills even the strong, and you are weak. St. John—you know him—would urge you to impossibilities: with him there would be no permission to rest during the hot hours; and unfortunately, I have noticed, whatever he exacts, you force yourself to perform. I am astonished you found courage to refuse his hand. You do not love him then, Jane?”\n“Not as a husband.”\n“Yet he is a handsome fellow.”\n“And I am so plain, you see, Die. We should never suit.”\n“Plain! You? Not at all. You are much too pretty, as well as too good, to be grilled alive in Calcutta.” And again she earnestly conjured me to give up all thoughts of going out with her brother.\n“I must indeed,” I said; “for when just now I repeated the offer of serving him for a deacon, he expressed himself shocked at my want of decency. He seemed to think I had committed an impropriety in proposing to accompany him unmarried: as if I had not from the first hoped to find in him a brother, and habitually regarded him as such.”\n“What makes you say he does not love you, Jane?”\n“You should hear himself on the subject. He has again and again explained that it is not himself, but his office he wishes to mate. He has told me I am formed for labour—not for love: which is true, no doubt. But, in my opinion, if I am not formed for love, it follows that I am not formed for marriage. Would it not be strange, Die, to be chained for life to a man who regarded one but as a useful tool?”\n“Insupportable—unnatural—out of the question!”\n“And then,” I continued, “though I have only sisterly affection for him now, yet, if forced to be his wife, I can imagine the possibility of conceiving an inevitable, strange, torturing kind of love for him, because he is so talented; and there is often a certain heroic grandeur in his look, manner, and conversation. In that case, my lot would become unspeakably wretched. He would not want me to love him; and if I showed the feeling, he would make me sensible that it was a superfluity, unrequired by him, unbecoming in me. I know he would.”\n“And yet St. John is a good man,” said Diana.\n“He is a good and a great man; but he forgets, pitilessly, the feelings and claims of little people, in pursuing his own large views. It is better, therefore, for the insignificant to keep out of his way, lest, in his progress, he should trample them down. Here he comes!

And then he’ll stay here in England.”\n“Far from it, Diana; his only reason for asking me is to find a suitable collaborator for his difficult work in India.”\n“What! He expects you to go to India?”\n“Yes.”\n“That’s insane!” she exclaimed. “You wouldn’t survive three months there, I’m positive. You absolutely must not go; you haven’t agreed, have you, Jane?”\n“I have refused to marry him—”\n“And as a result, you’ve upset him?” she prompted.\n“Terribly; I fear he will never forgive me. Still, I offered to go with him as his sister.”\n“That was utterly reckless to offer, Jane. Consider the immense effort you’d be taking on—constant exhaustion, where fatigue kills even strong people, and you are fragile. St. John—you know his nature—would push you beyond your limits; he wouldn’t allow rest during the hottest parts of the day. And sadly, I’ve seen that you force yourself to meet whatever demands he makes. I’m amazed you found the courage to refuse his proposal. So you don’t love him, Jane?”\n“Not in a way that would lead to marriage.”\n“But he is quite handsome.”\n“And I am so plain, you see, Die. We would never be compatible.”\n“Plain! You? Not in the least. You are far too lovely, and too good, to be essentially roasted alive in Calcutta.” She again strongly urged me to dismiss any thought of accompanying her brother.\n“I truly must,” I said; “because when I just now repeated my offer to assist him as a sort of assistant, he seemed appalled by my supposed lack of propriety. He apparently thought it inappropriate for me to suggest going with him without being married—as if I hadn’t hoped from the beginning to see him as a brother and consistently treated him as such.”\n“Why do you say he doesn’t love you, Jane?”\n“You should hear him explain it himself. He has repeatedly stated that it is not him personally, but his mission, that he wishes to partner with. He told me I am made for work, not for love, which is probably true. However, in my view, if I am not suited for love, then I am not suited for marriage either. Wouldn’t it be odd, Die, to be bound for life to a man who only saw you as a useful tool?”\n“Unbearable—unnatural—absolutely out of the question!”\n“And furthermore,” I continued, “while I only feel sisterly affection for him now, if forced to be his wife, I can imagine possibly developing an inescapable, strange, tormenting kind of love for him because he is so gifted; and his appearance, manner, and conversation often possess a certain noble grandeur. In that scenario, my situation would become incredibly miserable. He would not want my love, and if I displayed such feelings, he would make it clear they were unnecessary, unwanted by him, and unseemly for me. I know he would.”\n“Yet St. John is a decent man,” Diana commented.\n“He is a decent and remarkable man, but he relentlessly disregards the feelings and needs of ordinary individuals when pursuing his grand objectives. It is best, therefore, for those of little consequence to stay out of his path, lest he crush them as he advances. Here he comes! I will leave you, Diana.” And I hurried upstairs as I saw him entering the garden.",
          "paraphrase_gpt-4.1-2025-04-14": "Upon returning to the sitting room, I saw Diana deep in thought at the window. She was much taller than me; she placed her hand on my shoulder and, bending down, studied my face. \n\n“Jane,” she remarked, “you’ve seemed nervous and pale lately—there’s clearly something wrong. Tell me what you and St. John are occupied with. I’ve been observing you for the past half hour through the window; forgive me for spying, but I’ve had suspicions for some time, though I can’t quite explain them. St. John is peculiar—” \n\nShe stopped for a moment. I remained silent, so she went on. \n\n“My brother has unusual intentions about you, I’m sure of it. He’s treated you with a special attention and concern I’ve never seen him show anyone else. For what purpose? I wish he loved you—does he, Jane?”\n\nI pressed her cool hand to my feverish forehead. “No, Die, not in the least.”\n\n“Then why does he constantly watch you, try to get you alone, and keep you near? Mary and I both thought he wanted to marry you.”\n\n“He does—he has proposed.”\n\nDiana clapped her hands. “That’s what we hoped! And will you accept, Jane? Then perhaps he’d stay in England.”\n\n“Quite the opposite, Diana; his only reason for proposing is to get a suitable companion to help him with his missionary work in India.”\n\n“He wants you to go to India?”\n\n“Yes.”\n\n“That’s madness!” she cried. “You wouldn’t survive three months there. You can’t go—surely you haven’t agreed, Jane?”\n\n“I’ve refused his marriage proposal—”\n\n“And he’s angry with you?” she guessed.\n\n“Very much so; I doubt he’ll ever forgive me, though I offered to go as his sister.”\n\n“That was a rash offer, Jane. Think of what you’d face—constant exertion, deadly for even the strong, and you’re not strong. St. John wouldn’t let you rest, not even when necessary, and you always do what he asks. I’m amazed you had the nerve to refuse. Do you love him, Jane?”\n\n“Not as a husband.”\n\n“But he’s handsome.”\n\n“And I’m plain, Die. We’d never be a good match.”\n\n“Plain? Nonsense. You’re too pretty and too good to end up suffering in Calcutta,” she insisted, urging me again to abandon any plans of joining her brother.\n\n“I really must,” I replied. “Just now, when I repeated my offer to help him as a deacon, he was appalled at my lack of propriety. He thinks it’s improper for me to suggest accompanying him unmarried, as though I’d ever thought of him as more than a brother.”\n\n“Why do you say he doesn’t love you, Jane?”\n\n“You should hear what he says. He’s told me repeatedly that it’s not for himself, but his position, that he seeks a wife. He says I’m made for work, not for love. That’s probably true, but in my view, not being suited for love means not being suited for marriage. Wouldn’t it be strange, Die, to be bound for life to someone who sees you as nothing but a useful tool?”\n\n“Impossible—intolerable!”\n\n“And beyond that,” I went on, “even if I only feel sisterly affection for him now, if I had to become his wife, I could see myself developing an odd, painful love for him because of his abilities and his heroic demeanor. That would be miserable—I’d love him, but he wouldn’t want it, and if I showed it, he’d think it inappropriate and unnecessary. I’m sure he would.”\n\n“Still, St. John is a good man,” Diana said.\n\n“He is, but in his pursuit of grand aims, he forgets about ordinary people’s needs and feelings. It’s safer for people like me to stay out of his way. Here he comes! I’ll leave you, Diana.” And seeing him in the garden, I hurried upstairs."

          "text_segment": "But I was forced to meet him again at supper. During that meal he appeared just as composed as usual. I had thought he would hardly speak to me, and I was certain he had given up the pursuit of his matrimonial scheme: the sequel showed I was mistaken on both points. He addressed me precisely in his ordinary manner, or what had, of late, been his ordinary manner—one scrupulously polite. No doubt he had invoked the help of the Holy Spirit to subdue the anger I had roused in him, and now believed he had forgiven me once more.\nFor the evening reading before prayers, he selected the twenty-first chapter of Revelation. It was at all times pleasant to listen while from his lips fell the words of the Bible: never did his fine voice sound at once so sweet and full—never did his manner become so impressive in its noble simplicity, as when he delivered the oracles of God: and to-night that voice took a more solemn tone—that manner a more thrilling meaning—as he sat in the midst of his household circle (the May moon shining in through the uncurtained window, and rendering almost unnecessary the light of the candle on the table): as he sat there, bending over the great old Bible, and described from its page the vision of the new heaven and the new earth—told how God would come to dwell with men, how He would wipe away all tears from their eyes, and promised that there should be no more death, neither sorrow nor crying, nor any more pain, because the former things were passed away.\nThe succeeding words thrilled me strangely as he spoke them: especially as I felt, by the slight, indescribable alteration in sound, that in uttering them, his eye had turned on me.\n“He that overcometh shall inherit all things; and I will be his God, and he shall be my son. But,” was slowly, distinctly read, “the fearful, the unbelieving, &c., shall have their part in the lake which burneth with fire and brimstone, which is the second death.”\nHenceforward, I knew what fate St. John feared for me.\nA calm, subdued triumph, blent with a longing earnestness, marked his enunciation of the last glorious verses of that chapter. The reader believed his name was already written in the Lamb’s book of life, and he yearned after the hour which should admit him to the city to which the kings of the earth bring their glory and honour; which has no need of sun or moon to shine in it, because the glory of God lightens it, and the Lamb is the light thereof.\nIn the prayer following the chapter, all his energy gathered—all his stern zeal woke: he was in deep earnest, wrestling with God, and resolved on a conquest. He supplicated strength for the weak-hearted; guidance for wanderers from the fold: a return, even at the eleventh hour, for those whom the temptations of the world and the flesh were luring from the narrow path. He asked, he urged, he claimed the boon of a brand snatched from the burning. Earnestness is ever deeply solemn: first, as I listened to that prayer, I wondered at his; then, when it continued and rose, I was touched by it, and at last awed. He felt the greatness and goodness of his purpose so sincerely: others who heard him plead for it, could not but feel it too.",
          "paraphrase_gemini-2.5-flash-preview-04-17": "I was obliged to encounter him again during supper. While we ate, he seemed just as composed as usual. I had expected him to barely speak to me and was certain he had abandoned his plans for marriage; subsequent events proved I was mistaken on both counts. He addressed me exactly in his typical manner, or rather, the manner he had adopted recently—one that was extremely polite. He had no doubt sought divine assistance to calm the anger I had provoked in him and now felt he had forgiven me once more.\nFor the scripture reading before prayers, he chose the twenty-first chapter of Revelation. It was always a pleasure to listen to the words of the Bible fall from his lips; his beautiful voice never sounded simultaneously so sweet and full, nor did his demeanor ever become so impressive in its noble simplicity, as when he delivered God's messages. That evening, his voice took on a more serious tone, and his manner acquired a more profound meaning, as he sat amidst his household circle (the May moon shining through the bare window, making the candle on the table almost unnecessary). As he sat there, bent over the large old Bible, he described from its pages the vision of the new heaven and the new earth—telling how God would come to live with humanity, how He would wipe away every tear from their eyes, and promising that there would be no more death, sorrow, crying, or pain, because the former things were gone.\nThe verses that followed affected me strangely as he spoke them, especially since I sensed, by a slight, indefinable shift in his voice, that his gaze had turned towards me while he uttered them.\n“The one who overcomes will inherit all things; and I will be their God, and they will be my son. But,” he read slowly and clearly, “the cowardly, the unbelieving, etc., will have their place in the lake burning with fire and sulfur, which is the second death.”\nFrom that moment, I understood the fate St. John feared for me.\nA quiet, subdued triumph mixed with intense longing marked his reading of the final glorious verses of that chapter. The reader believed his name was already recorded in the Lamb’s book of life, and he yearned for the moment that would grant him entry to the city where the world's rulers bring their splendor and honor, which needs neither sun nor moon because the glory of God illuminates it, and the Lamb is its light.\nIn the prayer that followed the chapter, all his energy gathered—all his severe dedication awakened; he was deeply sincere, struggling with God, determined to achieve victory. He pleaded for strength for the weak, guidance for those who had strayed from the fold, and a return, even at the last minute, for those whom worldly and physical temptations were luring from the righteous path. He asked, urged, and claimed the deliverance of someone snatched like a brand from the fire. Sincerity is always profoundly serious; initially, I was surprised by his, then, as it continued and intensified, I was moved by it, and finally, I was awed. He believed in the importance and righteousness of his purpose so genuinely; others who heard him plead for it could not help but feel it too.",
          "paraphrase_gpt-4.1-2025-04-14": "I had to face him again at supper, and during the meal, he seemed as calm as ever. I expected he would barely speak to me and had abandoned his intention of marrying me, but I was wrong about both. He interacted with me in his usual, very polite way, likely having prayed for help to control the anger I had provoked and having convinced himself he forgave me. For the evening Bible reading, he chose Revelation chapter twenty-one. It was always pleasant hearing him read scripture; his distinguished voice and dignified manner lent the words power, but tonight there was even more solemnity and meaning as moonlight shone through the window, nearly rendering the candle unnecessary, and he bent over the large Bible to describe the vision of a new heaven and earth—how God would dwell with humanity, dry their tears, and promise no more death or pain because the old sufferings are gone. The next words struck me deeply, particularly because a subtle change in his tone let me know he was looking at me as he spoke: “He that overcomes will inherit all things; I will be his God, and he will be my son. But…” he continued, “…the fearful, the unbelieving, etc., shall have their part in the lake burning with fire and brimstone, which is the second death.” From then on, I understood what doom St. John feared for me. His reading of the final, hopeful verses of the chapter was calm, yet full of passionate longing—the conviction that his own name was in the Book of Life and his deep desire to reach the heavenly city where God’s glory shines instead of the sun and moon. In the prayer that followed, his fervor and strong devotion grew even more intense: he prayed earnestly for strength for the weak, guidance for the lost, and redemption for those tempted by worldly desires, demanding that God rescue a soul from damnation. The sincerity and passion in his prayer were deeply moving and solemn—even awe-inspiring—that everyone listening felt the force of his conviction."

Diana and Mary having kissed him, left the room—in compliance, I think, with a whispered hint from him: I tendered my hand, and wished him a pleasant journey.\n“Thank you, Jane. As I said, I shall return from Cambridge in a fortnight: that space, then, is yet left you for reflection. If I listened to human pride, I should say no more to you of marriage with me; but I listen to my duty, and keep steadily in view my first aim—to do all things to the glory of God. My Master was long-suffering: so will I be. I cannot give you up to perdition as a vessel of wrath: repent—resolve, while there is yet time. Remember, we are bid to work while it is day—warned that ‘the night cometh when no man shall work.’ Remember the fate of Dives, who had his good things in this life. God give you strength to choose that better part which shall not be taken from you!”\nHe laid his hand on my head as he uttered the last words. He had spoken earnestly, mildly: his look was not, indeed, that of a lover beholding his mistress, but it was that of a pastor recalling his wandering sheep—or better, of a guardian angel watching the soul for which he is responsible. All men of talent, whether they be men of feeling or not; whether they be zealots, or aspirants, or despots—provided only they be sincere—have their sublime moments, when they subdue and rule. I felt veneration for St. John—veneration so strong that its impetus thrust me at once to the point I had so long shunned. I was tempted to cease struggling with him—to rush down the torrent of his will into the gulf of his existence, and there lose my own. I was almost as hard beset by him now as I had been once before, in a different way, by another. I was a fool both times. To have yielded then would have been an error of principle; to have yielded now would have been an error of judgment. So I think at this hour, when I look back to the crisis through the quiet medium of time: I was unconscious of folly at the instant.\nI stood motionless under my hierophant’s touch. My refusals were forgotten—my fears overcome—my wrestlings paralysed. The Impossible—i.e., my marriage with St. John—was fast becoming the Possible. All was changing utterly with a sudden sweep. Religion called—Angels beckoned—God commanded—life rolled together like a scroll—death’s gates opening, showed eternity beyond: it seemed, that for safety and bliss there, all here might be sacrificed in a second. The dim room was full of visions.\n“Could you decide now?” asked the missionary. The inquiry was put in gentle tones: he drew me to him as gently. Oh, that gentleness! how far more potent is it than force! I could resist St. John’s wrath: I grew pliant as a reed under his kindness. Yet I knew all the time, if I yielded now, I should not the less be made to repent, some day, of my former rebellion. His nature was not changed by one hour of solemn prayer: it was only elevated.\n“I could decide if I were but certain,” I answered: “were I but convinced that it is God’s will I should marry you, I could vow to marry you here and now—come afterwards what would!”\n“My prayers are heard!” ejaculated St. John. He pressed his hand firmer on my head, as if he claimed me: he surrounded me with his arm, almost as if he loved me (I say almost—I knew the difference—for I had felt what it was to be loved; but, like him, I had now put love out of the question, and thought only of duty). I contended with my inward dimness of vision, before which clouds yet rolled. I sincerely, deeply, fervently longed to do what was right; and only that. “Show me, show me the path!” I entreated of Heaven. I was excited more than I had ever been; and whether what followed was the effect of excitement the reader shall judge.",
          "paraphrase_gemini-2.5-flash-preview-04-17": "After the prayer, we said goodbye to him; he planned to leave very early the next morning. Diana and Mary kissed him goodbye and exited the room, which I believe he subtly prompted them to do. I offered him my hand and wished him a good trip.\n\n“Thank you, Jane. As I mentioned, I will be back from Cambridge in two weeks; this period gives you more time to reflect. If I were governed by worldly pride, I would stop discussing marriage with you; but I am guided by my duty and remain focused on my primary purpose—to perform all actions for God's glory. My Master was patient, and I will be too. I cannot abandon you to damnation as someone destined for wrath; repent and make your decision while there is still time. Remember, we are instructed to work during the day, warned that ‘the night comes when no one can work.’ Think of the fate of the rich man Dives, who enjoyed his worldly possessions in this life. May God grant you the strength to choose the better path that cannot be taken from you!”\n\nHe placed his hand on my head as he finished speaking. He had spoken with earnestness and gentleness; his expression was certainly not that of a lover looking at his beloved, but rather like a shepherd recalling a lost sheep—or more fittingly, a guardian angel watching over a soul they are responsible for. All gifted individuals, regardless of whether they possess deep emotions, are fervent believers, ambitious, or dominant—provided they are genuine—have these elevated moments when they possess great power and influence. I felt a profound respect for St. John—a respect so potent that it immediately propelled me towards the decision I had been avoiding for so long. I was tempted to stop resisting him—to be swept away by the force of his will into the depth of his life, and in doing so, lose my own identity. I felt pressured by him now, almost as intensely as I had been on a previous occasion, in a different context, by someone else. I realize now I was misguided both times. Giving in back then would have been a betrayal of principle; giving in now would be a lapse in judgment. This is how I see it now, reflecting on that critical moment from the calm perspective of time; at that very instant, I was not aware of my potential folly.\n\nI remained still under the missionary's touch. My past rejections were forgotten, my fears were overcome, and my resistance was paralysed. The prospect of marrying St. John, which seemed impossible, was rapidly becoming possible. Everything was changing completely in a sudden rush. Religion was calling, angels were beckoning, God was commanding—life seemed to contract like a scroll, and the gates of death opening revealed eternity beyond: it felt as though, to secure safety and happiness there, everything here could be sacrificed in an instant. The dimly lit room felt filled with spiritual visions.\n\n“Can you decide now?” the missionary asked. His question was voiced in gentle tones; he drew me towards him just as gently. Oh, that gentleness! How much more powerful it is than force! I could stand against St. John’s anger; under his kindness, I became as yielding as a reed. Yet, all the while, I knew that if I consented now, I would still later regret my earlier defiance. His fundamental nature had not been altered by that hour of intense prayer; it was merely elevated.\n\n“I could decide if I were absolutely sure,” I replied; “if only I were convinced that it is God’s will for me to marry you, I would vow to marry you right here and now—whatever the future consequences might be!”\n\n“My prayers have been answered!” St. John exclaimed. He pressed his hand more firmly on my head, as if claiming ownership of me; he put his arm around me, almost as if he loved me (I say *almost*—I understood the distinction, having experienced true love; but, like him, I had now set aside the question of love and was focusing solely on duty). I struggled with my own lack of clear perception, through which clouds continued to drift. I genuinely, deeply, and passionately desired to do what was right, and only that. “Show me, show me the path!” I prayed to Heaven. I was more intensely agitated than I had ever been; and whether what happened next was a result of this excitement, the reader must decide.",
          "paraphrase_gpt-4.1-2025-04-14": "After we finished praying, we said our goodbyes to him, since he was to leave very early the next morning. Diana and Mary kissed him and left the room, apparently because he had quietly suggested they do so. I shook his hand and wished him a good journey.\n\nHe thanked me and reminded me he would be back from Cambridge in two weeks, giving me that period to think about his proposal. He said that if he were guided by pride, he would stop talking about marrying me, but he felt compelled by his sense of duty and remained focused on serving God. He declared he would be patient, just as Christ was, and said he could not give up on me. He urged me to reflect and repent while there was still time, encouraging me to work for salvation before it was too late, and hoped I would choose the better, everlasting part.\n\nWhile he spoke these final words, he placed his hand on my head in blessing. His tone was earnest but gentle; though he did not look at me as a lover would, his demeanor was more like a clergyman shepherding a lost soul, or a guardian angel caring for the person entrusted to him. Talented, genuine people can inspire awe and command in pivotal moments, and I felt deep respect and reverence towards St. John now. His strength almost persuaded me to surrender my will and let myself be subsumed into his, as I’d once almost done with another person. Realizing this, I understood that giving in then or now would have been a mistake, though of different kinds. Only in retrospect did I see how close I was to succumbing.\n\nI stood still, overcome by the gravity St. John imparted; all my objections and fears faded as his plea became nearly irresistible. The impossibility of marrying him seemed to be dissolving. The force of religious duty swept over me, as if all of life and eternity pressed me towards sacrifice and spiritual fulfillment.\n\nSt. John then gently asked if I could decide at that moment, and his gentle manner was much harder to resist than any forceful demand. I realized that if I gave in, I might eventually regret abandoning my previous resistance, as his essential character had not changed, only elevated by the solemnity of the moment.\n\nI replied that I could decide if only I were sure it was God's will; then I could promise to marry him, whatever the consequences.\n\nSt. John responded with joy, pressing his hand more firmly on my head and almost embracing me, in a way that was close, but not quite, love—as I could clearly distinguish, having truly experienced love before. My head was still clouded and I only wished to do what was right, praying for guidance. I was more stirred up than ever before, and whatever happened next, I leave for the reader to judge whether it was due to this heightened state of emotion."

The feeling was not like an electric shock, but it was quite as sharp, as strange, as startling: it acted on my senses as if their utmost activity hitherto had been but torpor, from which they were now summoned and forced to wake.

The sensation wasn't like an electric shock, but it was just as sharp, peculiar, and startling. It affected my senses as though all their previous activity had been mere numbness, from which they were now abruptly awakened and compelled to respond. My senses became intensely alert and watchful: my eyes and ears waited intently while my body trembled. \"What did you hear? What do you see?\" St. John asked. I saw nothing, but from somewhere, I heard a voice cry out— \"Jane! Jane! Jane!\"—and nothing else. \"Oh God, what is it?\" I gasped. I might as well have asked, \"Where is it?\" because it didn't seem to be in the room, or the house, or the garden; it didn't come from the air, or from under the ground, or from overhead.

I became highly alert, my eyes and ears focused while I trembled. St. John asked me what I had heard or seen. I hadn’t seen anything, but I heard a voice call my name three times: “Jane! Jane! Jane!” and then nothing else. I gasped, asking, “O God! what is it?” but perhaps I should have asked where it was, since the voice didn’t seem to come from the room, the house, the garden, the air, the ground, or the sky.

Nature was awakened and did its very best, not a miracle, but its peak performance.\" I broke free from St. John, who had followed and tried to stop me. It was my turn to be in charge. My capabilities were fully engaged and powerful. I told him to refrain from asking questions or making comments; I wanted him to leave me; I needed and insisted on being alone. He obeyed instantly.

It bore these words—\n“You left me too suddenly last night. Had you stayed but a little longer, you would have laid your hand on the Christian’s cross and the angel’s crown. I shall expect your clear decision when I return this day fortnight. Meantime, watch and pray that you enter not into temptation: the spirit, I trust, is willing, but the flesh, I see, is weak.

In any case, I will be strong enough to seek, to investigate, to find a way out of this uncertainty and reach clear understanding.”\nIt was the first day of June, but the morning was cloudy and cold; rain drummed quickly against my windowpane.

I could not conceive or believe: it was more like an inspiration. The wondrous shock of feeling had come like the earthquake which shook the foundations of Paul and Silas’s prison; it had opened the doors of the soul’s cell and loosed its bands—it had wakened it out of its sleep, whence it sprang trembling, listening, aghast; then vibrated thrice a cry on my startled ear, and in my quaking heart and through my spirit, which neither feared nor shook, but exulted as if in joy over the success of one effort it had been privileged to make, independent of the cumbrous body.\n“Ere many days,” I said, as I terminated my musings, “I will know something of him whose voice seemed last night to summon me.

This astonishing emotional upheaval had struck like the earthquake that freed Paul and Silas from prison, opening the doors of my soul's confinement and releasing its restraints. It had roused it from its slumber, causing it to spring forth trembling, attentive, and terrified. Then, a distinct cry echoed three times in my startled ear, my shaking heart, and throughout my spirit, which paradoxously felt no fear or tremor but rather rejoiced as if celebrating the successful completion of a task it had been allowed to undertake, independent of the burden of the physical body.\n\n“In a few days,” I stated, concluding my thoughts, “I will learn something about the person whose voice seemed to call me last night.

          "text_segment": "I left Moor House at three o’clock P.M., and soon after four I stood at the foot of the sign-post of Whitcross, waiting the arrival of the coach which was to take me to distant Thornfield. Amidst the silence of those solitary roads and desert hills, I heard it approach from a great distance. It was the same vehicle whence, a year ago, I had alighted one summer evening on this very spot—how desolate, and hopeless, and objectless! It stopped as I beckoned. I entered—not now obliged to part with my whole fortune as the price of its accommodation. Once more on the road to Thornfield, I felt like the messenger-pigeon flying home.\nIt was a journey of six-and-thirty hours. I had set out from Whitcross on a Tuesday afternoon, and early on the succeeding Thursday morning the coach stopped to water the horses at a wayside inn, situated in the midst of scenery whose green hedges and large fields and low pastoral hills (how mild of feature and verdant of hue compared with the stern North-Midland moors of Morton!) met my eye like the lineaments of a once familiar face. Yes, I knew the character of this landscape: I was sure we were near my bourne.\n“How far is Thornfield Hall from here?” I asked of the ostler.\n“Just two miles, ma’am, across the fields.”\n“My journey is closed,” I thought to myself. I got out of the coach, gave a box I had into the ostler’s charge, to be kept till I called for it; paid my fare; satisfied the coachman, and was going: the brightening day gleamed on the sign of the inn, and I read in gilt letters, “The Rochester Arms.” My heart leapt up: I was already on my master’s very lands. It fell again: the thought struck it:—\n“Your master himself may be beyond the British Channel, for aught you know: and then, if he is at Thornfield Hall, towards which you hasten, who besides him is there? His lunatic wife: and you have nothing to do with him: you dare not speak to him or seek his presence. You have lost your labour—you had better go no farther,” urged the monitor. “Ask information of the people at the inn; they can give you all you seek: they can solve your doubts at once. Go up to that man, and inquire if Mr. Rochester be at home.”",
          "paraphrase_gemini-2.5-flash-preview-04-17": "Departing Moor House at 3 in the afternoon, I reached the Whitcross sign-post shortly after 4, anticipating the arrival of the coach bound for the distant Thornfield. In the quiet of those solitary roads and bare hills, I heard its approach from afar. It was the very same vehicle I had stepped off a year prior on a summer evening at this precise spot—how empty, despairing, and without purpose I had felt then! It halted when I signalled. I boarded it, no longer compelled to spend my entire savings for the fare. Once more en route to Thornfield, I felt like a carrier pigeon heading back to its nest.\n\nThe trip lasted thirty-six hours. I had commenced my journey from Whitcross on Tuesday afternoon, and by early Thursday morning, the coach paused for the horses to drink at an inn by the roadside. This inn was situated amidst scenery—green hedges, large fields, and gentle rolling hills (so pleasant in appearance and rich in colour compared to the harsh North-Midland moors of Morton!)—that struck me like the features of a face I once knew intimately. Indeed, I recognised this landscape; I was certain we were close to my destination.\n\n“How far is Thornfield Hall from here?” I inquired of the stableman.\n\n“Just two miles, ma’am, cutting across the fields.”\n\n“My travels have ended,” I reflected inwardly. I exited the coach, entrusted a box I had brought to the stableman for safekeeping until I claimed it, settled my fare, satisfied the coachman, and prepared to leave. The increasing light of the day illuminated the inn’s sign, and I read in gold lettering, “The Rochester Arms.” My heart leaped; I was already on my master’s very estate. It then fell again as a thought struck me:\n\n“For all you know, your master himself might be across the English Channel; and even if he is at Thornfield Hall, where you are hurrying, who else will be there but his deranged wife? You have no connection to him; you wouldn’t dare speak to him or seek him out. Your effort is wasted—you should not go any further,” the inner voice cautioned. “Ask the people at the inn for information; they can tell you everything you need to know and resolve your uncertainties immediately. Go up to that man and ask if Mr. Rochester is currently at home.”",
          "paraphrase_gpt-4.1-2025-04-14": "I departed from Moor House at three in the afternoon, and by a little after four I was at the Whitcross signpost, waiting for the coach that would take me far away to Thornfield. The quietness of the lonely roads and barren hills made the sound of the coach coming from afar very distinct. It was the same coach I had gotten off from at that very spot a year earlier—at a time when I had felt utterly abandoned and without purpose. When I signaled, the coach halted for me. I boarded, now not required to give up all my money for the fare. Once again headed to Thornfield, I felt like a homing pigeon returning at last. The trip lasted thirty-six hours. I had departed Whitcross on Tuesday afternoon, and by early Thursday morning, the coach stopped at a roadside inn to water the horses. The landscape around—a patchwork of green hedges, large fields, and gentle, lush hills—looked far softer than the harsh moors near Morton, and felt like seeing an old friend. I recognized the countryside and sensed that my destination was close. I asked the hostler how far it was to Thornfield Hall. \"Just two miles across the fields, ma’am,\" he replied. I realized my journey was nearly over. Exiting the carriage, I left my box with the hostler for safekeeping, paid my fare, and got ready to leave. The morning light gleamed on the inn’s sign, which read \"The Rochester Arms\" in golden letters. My heart leapt; I was on Mr. Rochester’s estate. But then doubt struck: For all I knew, Mr. Rochester could be far away across the sea; even if he was at Thornfield Hall, who else would be there? Only his insane wife, and I had no business with him—nor could I even dare speak to him. I might have come here for nothing. Perhaps I should go no further, a voice inside me warned. It might be wiser, I reasoned, to ask the inn’s people about Mr. Rochester’s whereabouts. I should approach that man and find out if Mr. Rochester was home."

I might yet once more see the Hall under the ray of her star. There was the stile before me—the very fields through which I had hurried, blind, deaf, distracted with a revengeful fury tracking and scourging me, on the morning I fled from Thornfield: ere I well knew what course I had resolved to take, I was in the midst of them. How fast I walked! How I ran sometimes! How I looked forward to catch the first view of the well-known woods! With what feelings I welcomed single trees I knew, and familiar glimpses of meadow and hill between them!\nAt last the woods rose; the rookery clustered dark; a loud cawing broke the morning stillness. Strange delight inspired me: on I hastened. Another field crossed—a lane threaded—and there were the courtyard walls—the back offices: the house itself, the rookery still hid. “My first view of it shall be in front,” I determined, “where its bold battlements will strike the eye nobly at once, and where I can single out my master’s very window: perhaps he will be standing at it—he rises early: perhaps he is now walking in the orchard, or on the pavement in front. Could I but see him!—but a moment! Surely, in that case, I should not be so mad as to run to him? I cannot tell—I am not certain. And if I did—what then? God bless him! What then? Who would be hurt by my once more tasting the life his glance can give me? I rave: perhaps at this moment he is watching the sun rise over the Pyrenees, or on the tideless sea of the south.”\nI had coasted along the lower wall of the orchard—turned its angle: there was a gate just there, opening into the meadow, between two stone pillars crowned by stone balls. From behind one pillar I could peep round quietly at the full front of the mansion. I advanced my head with precaution, desirous to ascertain if any bedroom window-blinds were yet drawn up: battlements, windows, long front—all from this sheltered station were at my command.\nThe crows sailing overhead perhaps watched me while I took this survey. I wonder what they thought. They must have considered I was very careful and timid at first, and that gradually I grew very bold and reckless. A peep, and then a long stare; and then a departure from my niche and a straying out into the meadow; and a sudden stop full in front of the great mansion, and a protracted, hardy gaze towards it. “What affectation of diffidence was this at first?” they might have demanded; “what stupid regardlessness now?”\nHear an illustration, reader.\nA lover finds his mistress asleep on a mossy bank; he wishes to catch a glimpse of her fair face without waking her. He steals softly over the grass, careful to make no sound; he pauses—fancying she has stirred: he withdraws: not for worlds would he be seen. All is still: he again advances: he bends above her; a light veil rests on her features: he lifts it, bends lower; now his eyes anticipate the vision of beauty—warm, and blooming, and lovely, in rest. How hurried was their first glance! But how they fix! How he starts! How he suddenly and vehemently clasps in both arms the form he dared not, a moment since, touch with his finger! How he calls aloud a name, and drops his burden, and gazes on it wildly! He thus grasps and cries, and gazes, because he no longer fears to waken by any sound he can utter—by any movement he can make. He thought his love slept sweetly: he finds she is stone dead.\nI looked with timorous joy towards a stately house: I saw a blackened ruin.",

Prolonging uncertainty meant prolonging hope. Perhaps I might still see Thornfield Hall illuminated by the light of her lucky star. The stile was right there before me – the very fields I had run through, numb, oblivious, driven by a furious vengeance pursuing and punishing me, on the morning I fled Thornfield. Before I even fully decided where I was going, I was in the middle of them. How quickly I walked! Sometimes, how I ran! How I eagerly looked forward to catching the first glimpse of the familiar woods! With what feeling I greeted individual trees I recognized and known views of the meadows and hills between them! Finally, the woods appeared; the clustered rookery looked dark; a loud cawing broke the morning silence. An unusual excitement surged through me; I hurried onward. Across another field, through a lane – and there were the courtyard walls, the service buildings; the main house itself was still hidden by the rookery. \"My first view of it will be from the front,\" I decided, \"where its impressive battlements will immediately make a striking impression, and where I can pinpoint my master's specific window. Maybe he'll be standing there – he gets up early. Maybe he's walking in the orchard or on the path in front now. If only I could see him! Even just for a moment! Surely, in that situation, I wouldn't be crazy enough to run to him? I can't say for sure. And if I did – what then? Bless him! What would happen? Who would be harmed by me experiencing the life his gaze can give me one more time? I'm rambling; perhaps right now he's watching the sun rise over the Pyrenees or the calm southern sea.\" I had moved along the lower wall of the orchard and rounded the corner. There was a gate just there, leading into the meadow, between two stone pillars topped with stone balls. From behind one pillar, I could peek cautiously around to see the mansion's full front. I carefully leaned my head out, wanting to check if any bedroom window blinds were raised yet. The battlements, the windows, the entire long front – all were visible to me from this sheltered spot. The crows flying above perhaps watched me while I surveyed. I wonder what they thought. They must have judged me to be very careful and hesitant at first, and then gradually growing very bold and reckless. A quick look, then a long stare; then leaving my hiding place and wandering out into the meadow; and suddenly stopping directly in front of the large mansion for a sustained, daring gaze towards it. \"What pretense of shyness was that initially?\" they might have asked; \"what foolish indifference now?\" Let me offer you an illustration, reader. A lover finds his beloved asleep on a mossy bank; he wants to catch a glimpse of her beautiful face without waking her. He creeps softly over the grass, careful not to make a sound; he stops, imagining she has stirred; he backs away; he wouldn't be seen for anything. All is quiet; he advances again; he bends over her; a light veil covers her face; he lifts it, bends lower; now his eyes anticipate the sight of beauty – warm, radiant, and lovely, in her sleep. How rapid was his first look! But how fixed his gaze becomes! How he reacts! How he suddenly and intensely wraps the form he dared not touch moments ago in both arms! How he shouts a name aloud, drops his burden, and stares wildly at it! He seizes and cries and stares because he no longer fears waking her with any sound or movement. He thought his love was sleeping peacefully; he finds she is stone dead. I looked with hesitant joy towards a grand house; I saw a burnt-out ruin.",

As long as I remained uncertain, I could still hang on to hope. Perhaps I would get to see the Hall illuminated once more by her presence. The stile lay ahead of me, and so did the same fields I had rushed through—confused, overwhelmed by vengeful anger—on the morning I escaped Thornfield. Before I realized it, I was back among them, walking and sometimes running quickly, looking eagerly for my first glimpse of the familiar woods. Each recognizable tree and view of the meadows and hills filled me with emotion. \n\nEventually the woods appeared, the group of rooks gathered darkly, and their loud calls broke the calm of morning, filling me with a strange joy. I hurried onward. After crossing another field and passing through a lane, I finally saw the courtyard walls and the back buildings; the house itself, and the rookery, were still out of sight. Deciding that I wanted my first view of the house to be from the front—so I could take in its impressive battlements at once and maybe catch sight of my master’s window, perhaps even see him there, or walking in the orchard or on the front walk—I resolved to go around. Would I rush to meet him if I saw him, or would I hold back? I couldn’t be sure. And what harm could there be in experiencing the happiness his presence would bring me just one more time? Perhaps, though, he was far away, watching a sunrise in the Pyrenees or gazing at a southern sea.\n\nI followed the outside wall of the orchard, turned the corner, and found a gate leading into the meadow between two stone pillars topped with stone balls. From behind one, I could carefully look out at the full front of the mansion, watching to see if any bedroom window shades were already open. From this hidden spot, I could see the battlements, the windows, and the grand facade.\n\nPerhaps the crows above noticed me as I surveyed the house, wondering at first why I was so cautious and later why I became so bold—first just peeking, then staring, and finally stepping out into the open to gaze intently at the mansion. They might have questioned my earlier shyness and my later boldness.\n\nLet me give a comparison, reader: Imagine a lover who discovers his beloved asleep on a mossy bank. He wants to admire her beauty without waking her, so he approaches quietly, pausing often, afraid even to be seen. When sure she’s still asleep, he gets closer, lifts a veil from her face, and prepares to be enchanted by her serene loveliness. His first glance is rushed, but soon he’s transfixed—then, suddenly, he realizes she is not asleep, but dead. Overcome by shock and despair, he embraces her and cries out because now he knows no noise will disturb her. \n\nIn the same way, I approached the grand house with nervous anticipation, only to find nothing but a burnt-out ruin."

It felt as if I could now hear whatever information was forthcoming—no matter how significant the revelations—with relative calmness. Since he was not dead, I believed I could cope with hearing he was living even on the other side of the world. I inquired, \"Does Mr. Rochester currently reside at Thornfield Hall?\" naturally anticipating the answer but wanting to put off asking directly about his actual location. \"No, madam, absolutely not! No one is living there anymore. I assume you're not from this area, or you would know about the events of last autumn—Thornfield Hall is now completely ruined; it burned down around harvest season. It was a terrible disaster! So much valuable property was lost; almost none of the furnishings could be rescued. The fire started late at night, and before the fire engines could reach from Millcote, the entire structure was engulfed in flames. It was a horrifying sight; I saw it personally.\"",

His reply assured me that Mr. Edward—my Mr. Rochester (may God keep him wherever he is!)—was alive and in fact the current owner. How comforting it was! Now that I knew he was not dead, I felt I could calmly face any revelations to come—even if they involved him being far away, at the ends of the earth.\n“Is Mr. Rochester living at Thornfield now?” I inquired—though I knew what the answer would be, I still wanted to postpone directly asking about his exact whereabouts.\n“No, madam—not at all! Thornfield Hall is empty. If you were from around here, you’d have already heard the news—last autumn there was a disaster. Thornfield Hall was almost completely destroyed by fire at harvest time. It was a terrible loss: so many valuable belongings lost, almost nothing could be saved. The fire started in the middle of the night, and before help could arrive from Millcote, the entire house was engulfed in flames. It was a dreadful sight; I saw it myself.”"

Indeed, I should say it was ascertained beyond a doubt. You are not perhaps aware,” he continued, edging his chair a little nearer the table, and speaking low, “that there was a lady—a—a lunatic, kept in the house?”\n“I have heard something of it.”\n“She was kept in very close confinement, ma’am; people even for some years was not absolutely certain of her existence. No one saw her: they only knew by rumour that such a person was at the Hall; and who or what she was it was difficult to conjecture. They said Mr. Edward had brought her from abroad, and some believed she had been his mistress. But a queer thing happened a year since—a very queer thing.”\nI feared now to hear my own story. I endeavoured to recall him to the main fact.\n“And this lady?”\n“This lady, ma’am,” he answered, “turned out to be Mr. Rochester’s wife! The discovery was brought about in the strangest way. There was a young lady, a governess at the Hall, that Mr. Rochester fell in—”\n“But the fire,” I suggested.\n“I’m coming to that, ma’am—that Mr. Edward fell in love with. The servants say they never saw anybody so much in love as he was: he was after her continually. They used to watch him—servants will, you know, ma’am—and he set store on her past everything: for all, nobody but him thought her so very handsome. She was a little small thing, they say, almost like a child. I never saw her myself; but I’ve heard Leah, the house-maid, tell of her. Leah liked her well enough. Mr. Rochester was about forty, and this governess not twenty; and you see, when gentlemen of his age fall in love with girls, they are often like as if they were bewitched. Well, he would marry her.”\n“You shall tell me this part of the story another time,” I said; “but now I have a particular reason for wishing to hear all about the fire. Was it suspected that this lunatic, Mrs. Rochester, had any hand in it?”\n“You’ve hit it, ma’am: it’s quite certain that it was her, and nobody but her, that set it going. She had a woman to take care of her called Mrs. Poole—an able woman in her line, and very trustworthy, but for one fault—a fault common to a deal of them nurses and matrons—she kept a private bottle of gin by her, and now and then took a drop over-much. It is excusable, for she had a hard life of it: but still it was dangerous; for when Mrs. Poole was fast asleep after the gin and water, the mad lady, who was as cunning as a witch, would take the keys out of her pocket, let herself out of her chamber, and go roaming about the house, doing any wild mischief that came into her head. They say she had nearly burnt her husband in his bed once: but I don’t know about that. However, on this night, she set fire first to the hangings of the room next her own, and then she got down to a lower storey, and made her way to the chamber that had been the governess’s—(she was like as if she knew somehow how matters had gone on, and had a spite at her)—and she kindled the bed there; but there was nobody sleeping in it, fortunately. The governess had run away two months before; and for all Mr. Rochester sought her as if she had been the most precious thing he had in the world, he never could hear a word of her; and he grew savage—quite savage on his disappointment: he never was a wild man, but he got dangerous after he lost her. He would be alone, too. He sent Mrs. Fairfax, the housekeeper, away to her friends at a distance; but he did it handsomely, for he settled an annuity on her for life: and she deserved it—she was a very good woman. Miss Adèle, a ward he had, was put to school. He broke off acquaintance with all the gentry, and shut himself up like a hermit at the Hall.”\n“What! did he not leave England?”\n“Leave England? Bless you, no! He would not cross the door-stones of the house, except at night, when he walked just like a ghost about the grounds and in the orchard as if he had lost his senses—which it is my opinion he had; for a more spirited, bolder, keener gentleman than he was before that midge of a governess crossed him, you never saw, ma’am. He was not a man given to wine, or cards, or racing, as some are, and he was not so very handsome; but he had a courage and a will of his own, if ever man had. I knew him from a boy, you see: and for my part, I have often wished that Miss Eyre had been sunk in the sea before she came to Thornfield Hall.”",
          "paraphrase_gemini-2.5-flash-preview-04-17": "\"Late at night!\" I whispered to myself. Yes, that specific hour always seemed to bring misfortune to Thornfield. \"Did anyone know how it started?\" I inquired. \"They speculated, madam; they speculated. In fact, I'd say it was confirmed without a doubt. You might not be aware,\" he continued, pulling his chair closer and lowering his voice, \"that a lady, a mentally ill woman, was kept confined in the house?\" \"I have heard something about that,\" I replied. \"She was kept extremely isolated, madam; for some years, people weren't even entirely sure she existed. No one ever saw her; they only knew through rumours that such a person resided at the Hall. It was hard to guess who or what she was. They said Mr. Edward brought her from abroad, and some believed she had been his lover.

I tried to steer him back to the main point. \"And this lady?\" \"This lady, madam,\" he responded, \"turned out to be Mr. Rochester's wife! The discovery was made in the most unusual way. There was a young woman, a governess at the Hall, with whom Mr. Rochester fell in—\" \"But the fire,\" I interjected. \"I'm getting to that, madam—that Mr. Edward fell in love with. The servants claim they never saw anyone so deeply in love as he was; he constantly pursued her. They used to observe him—servants do that, you know, madam—and he valued her above everything, even though no one else thought she was particularly attractive. She was a small person, they say, almost childlike. I never saw her myself, but I heard Leah, the housemaid, speak of her. Leah was quite fond of her. Mr. Rochester was around forty, and this governess wasn't yet twenty. You see, when gentlemen of his age become enamoured with young women, they often seem utterly captivated, as if by a spell. Well, he was determined to marry her.\" \"You can tell me that part of the story later,\" I said. \"Right now, I particularly want to hear everything about the fire. Was it suspected that this mentally ill woman, Mrs. Rochester, played a role in it?\" \"You're exactly right, madam; it's absolutely certain that it was her, and no one else, who started it. She had a keeper named Mrs. Poole—a competent woman in her profession and very dependable, except for one flaw, a common one among many nurses and attendants: she kept a hidden bottle of gin and occasionally drank too much. It's understandable, as she had a difficult life, but it was still risky. Because when Mrs. Poole was sound asleep after her gin and water, the mad lady, who was incredibly cunning, would take the keys from her pocket, unlock her room, and wander through the house, causing any mischief she could think of. They say she almost burned her husband alive in his bed once, but I'm not sure about that. However, on this night, she first set fire to the curtains in the room next to hers. Then she went down to a lower floor and made her way to the room that had belonged to the governess—(it seemed as if she somehow knew what had happened and held a grudge against her)—and she set the bed ablaze there. Fortunately, no one was sleeping in it. The governess had run away two months prior, and although Mr. Rochester searched for her as if she were the most precious thing in the world, he never found any trace of her. He became furious—quite savage in his disappointment. He was never a violent man before, but he became dangerous after she left. He also wanted to be alone. He sent Mrs. Fairfax, the housekeeper, away to stay with her relatives some distance off, but he did it generously, providing her with a lifelong annuity, which she deserved, as she was a very good woman. Miss Adèle, his ward, was sent to school. He stopped associating with all the local gentry and isolated himself like a hermit at the Hall.\" \"What! He didn't leave England?\" \"Leave England? Heavens, no! He wouldn't step foot outside the house, except at night, when he would walk around the grounds and orchard like a ghost, as if he had lost his mind—which, in my opinion, he had. You never saw a more spirited, courageous, or sharp gentleman than he was before that insignificant little governess crossed his path, madam. He wasn't a man given to drinking, gambling, or racing, like some are, and he wasn't particularly handsome. But he possessed a remarkable courage and determination like no other man I knew. I'd known him since he was a boy, you see. And personally, I've often wished that Miss Eyre had been swallowed by the sea before she ever came to Thornfield Hall.\"",
          "paraphrase_gpt-4.1-2025-04-14": "\"At the dead of night!\" I whispered. That was always the fateful time at Thornfield. \"Did they ever learn how it started?\" I asked. \n\n\"They had their theories, ma'am—actually, I think it's beyond doubt. Perhaps you don't know,\" he continued, moving his chair closer and lowering his voice, \"that there was a woman—yes, a madwoman—kept hidden in the house?\"\n\n\"I've heard mention of it.\"\n\n\"She was kept under strict lock and key, ma'am; for years no one could say for certain she even existed. No one ever saw her; people only gossiped that there was such a person in the Hall, but her identity was a mystery. They said Mr. Edward had brought her from overseas, and some thought she was his mistress. But something strange happened last year—a very strange event.\"\n\nI dreaded hearing my own story retold, so I tried to bring him back to the main point.\n\n\"And this lady?\"\n\n\"This lady, ma'am,\" he replied, \"turned out to be Mr. Rochester's wife!

Mr. Rochester was deeply in love with this young lady. The servants said they'd never seen anyone so smitten; he was always after her. You know how servants watch these things, ma'am. He prized her above all, though she wasn't considered particularly beautiful by anyone else. They say she was small, almost childlike. I never saw her myself, but Leah, the housemaid, spoke well of her. Mr. Rochester was about forty, the governess not yet twenty; and you see, when a man his age loves a young girl, it's like he's bewitched. He was determined to marry her.\"\n\n\"Tell me that part some other time,\" I said, \"right now I want to hear about the fire. Was Mrs. Rochester, the madwoman, suspected?\"\n\n\"You've guessed it, ma'am—it was certainly her who started it. She had a caretaker, Mrs. Poole—very skilled and trustworthy, but with one flaw common to many in her line—she kept a private bottle of gin and sometimes drank too much. Understandable, perhaps, given the hard life she led, but dangerous all the same—because when Mrs. Poole was deep asleep from the drink, the madwoman, clever as a fox, would take the keys from her pocket, slip out of her room, and roam the house, causing any chaos she wished. They say she nearly set her husband's bed on fire once, though I can't speak to that. But on this occasion, she first set fire to the curtains of the room next to hers, then got to a lower floor and found the governess's old room—almost as if she knew what had happened and wanted revenge on her. She lit the bed there, but thankfully no one was in it—the governess had left two months prior. Mr. Rochester looked for her everywhere, valuing her above all else, but he never found her; it made him despondent, even dangerous. He became a recluse, sending Mrs. Fairfax, the housekeeper, away but providing for her with a lifetime annuity—well-deserved, as she was a good woman. He sent his ward, Miss Adèle, to school, ended all social ties, and shut himself up at the Hall.\"\n\n\"He didn't leave England?\"\n\n\"Leave England? Not at all, ma'am! He wouldn't step foot outside the house except to wander the grounds at night like a ghost, as if he'd lost his mind—which I think he had. Before that little governess crossed his path, you'd never meet a braver or more determined man. He didn't drink, gamble, or race horses, and he wasn't what you'd call handsome, but he had true grit and willpower. I knew him from his boyhood, and to be honest, I've often wished Miss Eyre had never come to Thornfield Hall.\""

How?\" I felt a chill of fear. \"Where is he?\" I asked. \"Is he still in England?\"  \n\"Yes, he’s here in England; I doubt he could leave—he’s stuck here now.\"  \nThis news caused me terrible pain, and the man seemed determined to draw it out.  \n\"He’s completely blind,\" he finally said. \"Yes, Mr. Edward is totally blind.\"  \nI had feared something even worse—that he had gone insane. I mustered the courage to ask what had led to his suffering.  \n\"It was his own bravery, and in a way, his own kindness, ma’am. He refused to leave the house until everyone else was safe. As he finally came down the main staircase, after Mrs. Rochester jumped from the roof, there was a huge collapse—everything fell in. He was pulled from the debris, still alive but severely injured. A beam had protected him a little, but one of his eyes was lost, and one hand was so badly damaged that Mr. Carter, the doctor, had to amputate it immediately. His other eye became infected and he lost sight in that one too. Now he’s truly helpless—blind and disabled.\""

          "text_segment": "The manor-house of Ferndean was a building of considerable antiquity, moderate size, and no architectural pretensions, deep buried in a wood. I had heard of it before. Mr. Rochester often spoke of it, and sometimes went there. His father had purchased the estate for the sake of the game covers. He would have let the house, but could find no tenant, in consequence of its ineligible and insalubrious site. Ferndean then remained uninhabited and unfurnished, with the exception of some two or three rooms fitted up for the accommodation of the squire when he went there in the season to shoot.\nTo this house I came just ere dark on an evening marked by the characteristics of sad sky, cold gale, and continued small penetrating rain. The last mile I performed on foot, having dismissed the chaise and driver with the double remuneration I had promised. Even when within a very short distance of the manor-house, you could see nothing of it, so thick and dark grew the timber of the gloomy wood about it. Iron gates between granite pillars showed me where to enter, and passing through them, I found myself at once in the twilight of close-ranked trees. There was a grass-grown track descending the forest aisle between hoar and knotty shafts and under branched arches. I followed it, expecting soon to reach the dwelling; but it stretched on and on, it wound far and farther: no sign of habitation or grounds was visible.\nI thought I had taken a wrong direction and lost my way. The darkness of natural as well as of sylvan dusk gathered over me. I looked round in search of another road. There was none: all was interwoven stem, columnar trunk, dense summer foliage—no opening anywhere.\nI proceeded: at last my way opened, the trees thinned a little; presently I beheld a railing, then the house—scarce, by this dim light, distinguishable from the trees; so dank and green were its decaying walls. Entering a portal, fastened only by a latch, I stood amidst a space of enclosed ground, from which the wood swept away in a semicircle. There were no flowers, no garden-beds; only a broad gravel-walk girdling a grass-plat, and this set in the heavy frame of the forest. The house presented two pointed gables in its front; the windows were latticed and narrow: the front door was narrow too, one step led up to it. The whole looked, as the host of the Rochester Arms had said, “quite a desolate spot.” It was as still as a church on a week-day: the pattering rain on the forest leaves was the only sound audible in its vicinage.\n“Can there be life here?” I asked.\nYes, life of some kind there was; for I heard a movement—that narrow front-door was unclosing, and some shape was about to issue from the grange.\nIt opened slowly: a figure came out into the twilight and stood on the step; a man without a hat: he stretched forth his hand as if to feel whether it rained. Dusk as it was, I had recognised him—it was my master, Edward Fairfax Rochester, and no other.\nI stayed my step, almost my breath, and stood to watch him—to examine him, myself unseen, and alas! to him invisible. It was a sudden meeting, and one in which rapture was kept well in check by pain. I had no difficulty in restraining my voice from exclamation, my step from hasty advance.\nHis form was of the same strong and stalwart contour as ever: his port was still erect, his hair was still raven black; nor were his features altered or sunk: not in one year’s space, by any sorrow, could his athletic strength be quelled or his vigorous prime blighted. But in his countenance I saw a change: that looked desperate and brooding—that reminded me of some wronged and fettered wild beast or bird, dangerous to approach in his sullen woe. The caged eagle, whose gold-ringed eyes cruelty has extinguished, might look as looked that sightless Samson.\nAnd, reader, do you think I feared him in his blind ferocity?—if you do, you little know me. A soft hope blent with my sorrow that soon I should dare to drop a kiss on that brow of rock, and on those lips so sternly sealed beneath it: but not yet. I would not accost him yet.\nHe descended the one step, and advanced slowly and gropingly towards the grass-plat. Where was his daring stride now? Then he paused, as if he knew not which way to turn. He lifted his hand and opened his eyelids; gazed blank, and with a straining effort, on the sky, and toward the amphitheatre of trees: one saw that all to him was void darkness. He stretched his right hand (the left arm, the mutilated one, he kept hidden in his bosom); he seemed to wish by touch to gain an idea of what lay around him: he met but vacancy still; for the trees were some yards off where he stood. He relinquished the endeavour, folded his arms, and stood quiet and mute in the rain, now falling fast on his uncovered head. At this moment John approached him from some quarter.\n“Will you take my arm, sir?” he said; “there is a heavy shower coming on: had you not better go in?”\n“Let me alone,” was the answer.\nJohn withdrew without having observed me. Mr. Rochester now tried to walk about: vainly,—all was too uncertain. He groped his way back to the house, and, re-entering it, closed the door.",
          "paraphrase_gemini-2.5-flash-preview-04-17": "Ferndean Manor was an old, moderately-sized house, without any fancy architectural features, completely hidden within a dense forest. I was familiar with the name; Mr. Rochester frequently mentioned it and sometimes visited. His father had bought the estate specifically for hunting. He would have rented out the house, but its unsuitable and unhealthy location meant no one wanted to live there. Consequently, Ferndean remained empty and unfurnished, apart from a few rooms set up for the squire's use during hunting season. I arrived at this house just before nightfall on an evening characterized by a grey sky, chilly wind, and persistent fine, piercing rain. I covered the last mile on foot, having sent the carriage and driver away after paying them double what I owed. Even when I was very near the manor, I couldn't see it because the trees in the gloomy woods surrounding it grew so densely and darkly. Iron gates set between stone pillars marked the entrance, and stepping through them, I immediately entered the dim light beneath closely packed trees. A track overgrown with grass led down the forest path, winding between ancient, gnarled tree trunks under the canopy of branches. I followed it, expecting to quickly reach the house, but it went on and on, twisting further and further, with no sign of a building or cultivated land visible. I began to think I had taken a wrong turn and gotten lost. The darkness of both the approaching night and the dense woods enveloped me. I searched for another path but found none; everywhere was just tangled branches, straight tree trunks, and thick summer leaves—there was no break in the forest. I kept going; eventually, my path opened up, and the trees became less dense. Soon, I saw a railing, and then the house itself—which, in the poor light, was barely visible against the trees because its crumbling walls were so damp and covered in green growth. I entered through a doorway, which was only secured by a latch, and found myself in an enclosed area, with the woods curving away in a semicircle. There were no flowers or garden beds, just a wide gravel path surrounding a patch of grass, all framed heavily by the forest. The house had two pointed peaks at the front; the windows were narrow and had lattice panes; the front door was also narrow, with a single step leading up to it. As the innkeeper at the Rochester Arms had described, the entire place looked \"quite a desolate spot.\" It was as quiet as a church on a weekday; the only noise nearby was the sound of rain tapping on the forest leaves. \"Could anyone live here?\" I wondered. Yes, there was some form of life, because I heard movement—that narrow front door was opening, and a figure was about to come out of the building. It opened slowly, and a shape emerged into the fading light and stood on the step; it was a man without a hat. He held out his hand as if checking whether it was raining. Despite the dimness, I recognized him instantly—it was my master, Edward Fairfax Rochester, and no one else. I stopped walking, almost holding my breath, and stood to watch him, observing him myself while remaining hidden and, sadly, invisible to him. It was an unexpected encounter, one where my intense joy was held in check by sorrow. I had no trouble preventing myself from crying out or rushing forward. His build was as strong and sturdy as ever; his posture remained upright, and his hair was still black as a raven. His facial features hadn't changed or become hollowed; no amount of grief in just one year could have weakened his powerful physique or damaged his robust health. However, I saw a change in his expression: it looked despairing and preoccupied—it brought to mind a wild animal or bird that had been wronged and trapped, someone dangerous to approach in his gloomy suffering. He looked like a caged eagle whose cruel treatment had blinded its keen eyes, or like the biblical Samson after he was blinded. And, dear reader, if you think I was afraid of him in his blind intensity, then you don't know me at all. A gentle hope mixed with my sadness that before long I would be brave enough to kiss that firm forehead and those lips so tightly closed beneath it; but not yet. I wouldn't speak to him just yet. He stepped down from the single step and moved slowly and cautiously towards the grassy area, feeling his way. Where was his confident stride now? He stopped, as if unsure which direction to go. He lifted his hand and opened his eyes, staring blankly, with a strained effort, at the sky and towards the surrounding circle of trees; it was clear that everything was empty darkness to him. He extended his right hand (keeping his injured left arm hidden inside his jacket); it seemed he was trying to understand his surroundings by touch. But he only met empty space, as the trees were several yards away from where he stood. He gave up the attempt, crossed his arms, and stood still and silent in the rain, which was now falling heavily on his bare head. At this moment, John came up to him from somewhere nearby. \"Would you like my arm, sir?\" John asked. \"A heavy rain is starting; shouldn't you go inside?\" \"Leave me,\" was the reply. John left without noticing me. Mr. Rochester then tried to walk around, but couldn't; everything was too unstable for him. He felt his way back to the house and, going inside again, shut the door.",
          "paraphrase_gpt-4.1-2025-04-14": "Ferndean Manor was an old house of moderate size with no noteworthy design, deeply concealed within a forest. I had heard about it previously, as Mr. Rochester often mentioned the place and occasionally visited it. His father had originally bought the property for the quality of its hunting lands but never managed to find a tenant for the house, since its location was both unhealthy and undesirable. As a result, Ferndean stayed unoccupied and unfurnished except for a few rooms prepared for Mr. Rochester’s occasional hunting trips.\n\nI arrived at Ferndean just before nightfall, on an evening characterized by a gloomy sky, a cold wind, and persistent, soaking rain. I walked the final mile after dismissing the carriage and driver with extra payment as promised. Even when close to the manor, the thick and dark woods completely hid it from view. Granite pillars and iron gates marked the entrance to the property, leading me into a shadowy avenue formed by tightly growing trees. A grass-covered path stretched down between ancient trunks and under a canopy of boughs. I continued, expecting to see the house at any moment, but the path went on much further than I anticipated, without any sign of habitation.\n\nI started to think I had taken a wrong turn and was lost, surrounded by both the natural dusk and the darkness of the dense trees. I searched for another way but saw only an unbroken wall of thick trunks and foliage.\n\nEventually, the path widened and the trees became sparser. Soon I spotted a fence and then the house itself, its decaying, damp green walls almost blending into the surrounding forest. Entering through an unlatched portal, I found myself in an enclosed area from which the forest retreated in a semi-circle. There were no flowers or garden beds, just a wide gravel walk encircling a grassy patch, all bordered by the dense woods. The house’s front had two pointed gables and narrow lattice windows, and the front door was also narrow, approached by only a single step. Altogether, it matched the description I had heard before: a truly desolate place. It was as quiet as a church during a weekday—the only sound was the steady fall of rain on the leaves.\n\nI wondered, “Is there any life here?”\n\nThere was. I heard movement; the slim front door began to open and a figure appeared in the dim light—a hatless man who reached out as if to check for rain. Despite the gloom, I recognized him immediately: it was Mr. Rochester.\n\nI stopped moving and barely breathed, watching him while remaining unnoticed myself; he, of course, could not see me. Our meeting was sudden, and though exciting, it was clouded by pain. I found it easy to remain quiet and still, restraining myself from rushing forward or calling out.\n\nHe remained as strong and solid in build as ever, still standing tall with jet-black hair and well-defined features. No sorrow of one year had diminished his physical power or youth. Yet, I noticed a change in his expression—one of deep despair and brooding, reminding me of a wronged, caged wild creature, dangerous and grieving. He resembled a blind and imprisoned eagle or Samson, proud but sightless.\n\nAnd, reader, if you think I was afraid of him in his blindness and torment, you do not understand me. Amid my sorrow, I also felt a gentle hope that soon I might embrace him, but not yet. I would not reveal myself right away.\n\nHe stepped slowly off the porch, feeling his way toward the grass. Gone was his confident stride; he hesitated, uncertain where to turn. He raised his hand and eyelids toward the sky and trees, though it was clear that to him, everything was blank darkness. He reached out, trying to understand his surroundings by touch, but found only empty space—the trees were still some distance away. Abandoning the attempt, he folded his arms and stood in the rain, letting it fall heavily on his uncovered head. At that moment, John appeared.\n\n“Would you like my help, sir? It’s about to rain heavily—maybe you should go inside?” John suggested.\n\nRochester replied, “Leave me alone.”\n\nJohn went away, not noticing me. Mr. Rochester tried to move around by himself, but it was pointless; everything was too uncertain. He felt his way back to the house and closed the door behind him."

Pilot pricked up his ears when I came in: then he jumped up with a yelp and a whine, and bounded towards me: he almost knocked the tray from my hands.

Who is this?” he demanded, trying, as it seemed, to see with those sightless eyes—unavailing and distressing attempt! “Answer me—speak again!” he ordered, imperiously and aloud.\n“Will you have a little more water, sir? I spilt half of what was in the glass,” I said.\n“Who is it? What is it? Who speaks?”\n“Pilot knows me, and John and Mary know I am here. I came only this evening,” I answered.\n“Great God!—what delusion has come over me? What sweet madness has seized me?”\n“No delusion—no madness: your mind, sir, is too strong for delusion, your health too sound for frenzy.”\n“And where is the speaker? Is it only a voice? Oh! I cannot see, but I must feel, or my heart will stop and my brain burst. Whatever—whoever you are—be perceptible to the touch or I cannot live!”\nHe groped; I arrested his wandering hand, and prisoned it in both mine.\n“Her very fingers!” he cried; “her small, slight fingers! If so there must be more of her.”\nThe muscular hand broke from my custody; my arm was seized, my shoulder—neck—waist—I was entwined and gathered to him.\n“Is it Jane? What is it? This is her shape—this is her size—”\n“And this her voice,” I added. “She is all here: her heart, too. God bless you, sir! I am glad to be so near you again.”\n“Jane Eyre!—Jane Eyre,” was all he said.\n“My dear master,” I answered, “I am Jane Eyre: I have found you out—I am come back to you.”\n“In truth?—in the flesh?

Pilot perked up his ears at my entry; then, with a yelp and a whine, he leaped up and charged towards me, almost knocking the tray from my hands. I placed it on the table, then stroked him gently and murmured, \"Lie down!\" Mr. Rochester automatically turned to ascertain the source of the disturbance, but perceiving nothing, he turned back and sighed. \"Give me the water, Mary,\" he instructed. I approached him with the glass, now only half full; Pilot trailed behind me, still agitated. \"What's the matter?\" he inquired. \"Down, Pilot!\" I repeated. He paused the glass on its way to his lips and appeared to listen; he drank and set the glass down. \"This is you, Mary, isn't it?\" \"Mary is in the kitchen,\" I replied. He quickly extended his hand, but not seeing where I was positioned, he didn't touch me. \"Who is this? Who is this?\" he demanded, seemingly attempting to perceive with those unseeing eyes – a futile and heartbreaking effort! \"Answer me – speak again!\" he commanded, authoritatively and loudly. \"Would you like a little more water, sir? I spilled half of what was in the glass,\" I said. \"Who is it? What is it? Who is speaking?\" \"Pilot recognizes me, and John and Mary know I'm here. I only arrived this evening,\" I responded. \"Great God! – what illusion has overcome me? What delightful madness has seized me?\" \"No illusion – no madness; your mind, sir, is too resilient for illusion, your health too robust for frenzy.\" \"And where is the speaker? Is it just a voice? Oh! I cannot see, but I must touch, or my heart will cease and my mind explode. Whoever – whatever you are – let me feel you, or I cannot survive!\" He fumbled; I intercepted his wandering hand and held it firmly in both of mine. \"Her very fingers!\" he exclaimed; \"her small, slender fingers! If so, there must be more of her.\" The strong hand broke free from my grasp; my arm was seized, my shoulder – neck – waist – I was wrapped up and pulled into his embrace. \"Is it Jane? What is this? This is her form – this is her height –\" \"And this her voice,\" I added. \"She is entirely here: her heart, too. God bless you, sir! I am overjoyed to be this close to you again.\" \"Jane Eyre! – Jane Eyre,\" was all he uttered. \"My dear master,\" I replied, \"I am Jane Eyre; I have sought you out – I have returned to you.\" \"Truly? – in the flesh? My living Jane?\" \"You are touching me, sir – you are holding me, quite tightly: I am not cold like a corpse, nor insubstantial like air, am I?\" \"My living beloved! These are undoubtedly her limbs, and these her features; but I cannot be this fortunate, after all my suffering. It is a dream; such dreams as I have experienced at night when I have held her close once more, as I am doing now; and kissed her, like this – and sensed that she loved me, and believed that she would not abandon me.\"",

I can’t see, but I need to feel, or I’ll go mad!”\n\nHe reached out, and I took his hand in both of mine.\n\n“My God, it’s really her fingers,” he gasped; “there must be more of her.”\n\nHe pulled free and seized my arm, then my shoulder and waist, wrapping me tightly in his arms.\n\n“Is it Jane?

But no hint to that effect escaping him and his countenance becoming more overcast, I suddenly remembered that I might have been all wrong, and was perhaps playing the fool unwittingly; and I began gently to withdraw myself from his arms—but he eagerly snatched me closer.\n“No—no—Jane; you must not go. No—I have touched you, heard you, felt the comfort of your presence—the sweetness of your consolation: I cannot give up these joys. I have little left in myself—I must have you. The world may laugh—may call me absurd, selfish—but it does not signify. My very soul demands you: it will be satisfied, or it will take deadly vengeance on its frame.”\n“Well, sir, I will stay with you: I have said so.”\n“Yes—but you understand one thing by staying with me; and I understand another. You, perhaps, could make up your mind to be about my hand and chair—to wait on me as a kind little nurse (for you have an affectionate heart and a generous spirit, which prompt you to make sacrifices for those you pity), and that ought to suffice for me no doubt. I suppose I should now entertain none but fatherly feelings for you: do you think so? Come—tell me.”\n“I will think what you like, sir: I am content to be only your nurse, if you think it better.”\n“But you cannot always be my nurse, Janet: you are young—you must marry one day.”\n“I don’t care about being married.”\n“You should care, Janet: if I were what I once was, I would try to make you care—but—a sightless block!”\nHe relapsed again into gloom. I, on the contrary, became more cheerful, and took fresh courage: these last words gave me an insight as to where the difficulty lay; and as it was no difficulty with me, I felt quite relieved from my previous embarrassment. I resumed a livelier vein of conversation.\n“It is time some one undertook to rehumanise you,” said I, parting his thick and long uncut locks; “for I see you are being metamorphosed into a lion, or something of that sort. You have a ‘faux air’ of Nebuchadnezzar in the fields about you, that is certain: your hair reminds me of eagles’ feathers; whether your nails are grown like birds’ claws or not, I have not yet noticed.”\n“On this arm, I have neither hand nor nails,” he said, drawing the mutilated limb from his breast, and showing it to me. “It is a mere stump—a ghastly sight! Don’t you think so, Jane?”\n“It is a pity to see it; and a pity to see your eyes—and the scar of fire on your forehead: and the worst of it is, one is in danger of loving you too well for all this; and making too much of you.”\n“I thought you would be revolted, Jane, when you saw my arm, and my cicatrised visage.”\n“Did you? Don’t tell me so—lest I should say something disparaging to your judgment. Now, let me leave you an instant, to make a better fire, and have the hearth swept up. Can you tell when there is a good fire?”\n“Yes; with the right eye I see a glow—a ruddy haze.”\n“And you see the candles?”\n“Very dimly—each is a luminous cloud.”\n“Can you see me?”\n“No, my fairy: but I am only too thankful to hear and feel you.”\n“When do you take supper?”\n“I never take supper.”\n“But you shall have some to-night. I am hungry: so are you, I daresay, only you forget.”\nSummoning Mary, I soon had the room in more cheerful order: I prepared him, likewise, a comfortable repast. My spirits were excited, and with pleasure and ease I talked to him during supper, and for a long time after. There was no harassing restraint, no repressing of glee and vivacity with him; for with him I was at perfect ease, because I knew I suited him; all I said or did seemed either to console or revive him. Delightful consciousness! It brought to life and light my whole nature: in his presence I thoroughly lived; and he lived in mine.

Don’t tell me that—lest I should say something unfavorable about your judgment. Now, let me leave you for a moment, to build a better fire and sweep the hearth clean. Can you tell when there is a good fire?”\n“Yes; with the right eye I see a glow—a reddish mist.”\n“And you see the candles?”\n“Very faintly—each is a hazy light.”\n“Can you see me?”\n“No, my fairy: but I am only too thankful to hear and feel you.”\n“When do you eat supper?”\n“I never eat supper.”\n“But you shall have some tonight.

When he gave no such sign and instead looked even gloomier, it occurred to me that maybe I had been completely mistaken and looked foolish. I started to gently move away from his embrace, but he pulled me back quickly.\n\n“No, Jane, don’t leave,” he said. “Now that I’ve been close to you, heard your voice, and felt comforted by you, I can’t give that up. I have little left but I need you. People might laugh at me or call me selfish, but that doesn’t matter. My very soul needs you—if it’s not satisfied, it will destroy me.”\n\n“I’ll stay with you, sir. I’ve already promised I would,” I replied.\n\n“Yes, but what you mean by staying is different from what I mean. You’d probably be content to help me—to wait on me as a caring nurse because you’re compassionate and quick to sacrifice for those you pity. That might be enough for me in theory. I suppose I’m supposed to think of you only in a fatherly way now—do you believe that? Tell me.”\n\n“I’ll do whatever makes you happy, sir. If you want me to be just your nurse, that’s fine with me.”\n\n“But you can’t stay my nurse forever, Jane. You’re young—you’ll want to marry one day.”\n\n“I don’t care about getting married.”\n\n“You should care, Jane. If I were who I used to be, I’d make sure you cared—but now I’m just a blind wreck.”\n\nHe withdrew, becoming somber again. In contrast, I felt lighter and reassured by his words, for I now understood why he was troubled, and it wasn’t an obstacle for me. Encouraged, I resumed talking, teasing him a little.\n\n“Someone needs to make you human again,” I said, running my fingers through his long, untidy hair. “You’re turning into a beast. You look a little like Nebuchadnezzar after he was driven into the fields; your hair is wild, like eagles’ feathers. I haven’t checked if your nails are growing like talons yet.”\n\nHe showed me his mutilated arm. “I don’t have a hand or nails here,” he said, displaying the stump. “It’s horrible to look at, isn’t it, Jane?”\n\n“It’s sad to see,” I answered, “and so is looking at your eyes and the burn on your forehead. But strangely enough, those things only make me love you more and care about you too much.”\n\n“I thought you’d be disgusted by my injuries, Jane.”\n\n“Did you? Don’t say that, or I’ll have to criticize your judgment. Now, let me step away to fix the fire and tidy the hearth. Can you tell when the fire is burning well?”\n\n“Yes, I see a reddish glow with my good eye.”\n\n“And what about the candles?”\n\n“I see them, but just as faint, glowing blobs.”\n\n“Can you see me?”\n\n“No, my dear, I can only hear and feel you—and I am so grateful for that.”\n\n“When do you usually eat supper?”\n\n“I never really have supper.”\n\n“Well, you will tonight. I’m hungry, and I bet you are too, even if you don’t realize it.”\n\nI called Mary to help make the room cozy and prepared a nice meal for him. My spirits were lifted, and I chatted cheerfully with him through supper and well afterwards. Around him, I felt completely at ease; I didn’t have to hold back any happiness or playfulness, because I knew I pleased and comforted him. That certainty awakened my true self—I felt most alive with him, and he came alive in my company. Even blind, smiles brightened his face, happiness appeared in his expression, and he softened in my presence."

Besides, I wished to touch no deep-thrilling chord—to open no fresh well of emotion in his heart: my sole present aim was to cheer him. Cheered, as I have said, he was: and yet but by fits. If a moment’s silence broke the conversation, he would turn restless, touch me, then say, “Jane.”\n“You are altogether a human being, Jane? You are certain of that?”\n“I conscientiously believe so, Mr. Rochester.”\n“Yet how, on this dark and doleful evening, could you so suddenly rise on my lone hearth? I stretched my hand to take a glass of water from a hireling, and it was given me by you: I asked a question, expecting John’s wife to answer me, and your voice spoke at my ear.”\n“Because I had come in, in Mary’s stead, with the tray.”\n“And there is enchantment in the very hour I am now spending with you. Who can tell what a dark, dreary, hopeless life I have dragged on for months past? Doing nothing, expecting nothing; merging night in day; feeling but the sensation of cold when I let the fire go out, of hunger when I forgot to eat: and then a ceaseless sorrow, and, at times, a very delirium of desire to behold my Jane again. Yes: for her restoration I longed, far more than for that of my lost sight. How can it be that Jane is with me, and says she loves me? Will she not depart as suddenly as she came? To-morrow, I fear I shall find her no more.”\nA commonplace, practical reply, out of the train of his own disturbed ideas, was, I was sure, the best and most reassuring for him in this frame of mind. I passed my finger over his eyebrows, and remarked that they were scorched, and that I would apply something which would make them grow as broad and black as ever.\n“Where is the use of doing me good in any way, beneficent spirit, when, at some fatal moment, you will again desert me—passing like a shadow, whither and how to me unknown, and for me remaining afterwards undiscoverable?”\n“Have you a pocket-comb about you, sir?”\n“What for, Jane?”\n“Just to comb out this shaggy black mane. I find you rather alarming, when I examine you close at hand: you talk of my being a fairy, but I am sure, you are more like a brownie.”\n“Am I hideous, Jane?”\n“Very, sir: you always were, you know.”\n“Humph! The wickedness has not been taken out of you, wherever you have sojourned.”\n“Yet I have been with good people; far better than you: a hundred times better people; possessed of ideas and views you never entertained in your life: quite more refined and exalted.”\n“Who the deuce have you been with?”\n“If you twist in that way you will make me pull the hair out of your head; and then I think you will cease to entertain doubts of my substantiality.”\n“Who have you been with, Jane?”\n“You shall not get it out of me to-night, sir; you must wait till to-morrow; to leave my tale half told, will, you know, be a sort of security that I shall appear at your breakfast table to finish it. By the bye, I must mind not to rise on your hearth with only a glass of water then: I must bring an egg at the least, to say nothing of fried ham.”\n“You mocking changeling—fairy-born and human-bred! You make me feel as I have not felt these twelve months. If Saul could have had you for his David, the evil spirit would have been exorcised without the aid of the harp.”\n“There, sir, you are redd up and made decent. Now I’ll leave you: I have been travelling these last three days, and I believe I am tired. Good night.”\n“Just one word, Jane: were there only ladies in the house where you have been?”\nI laughed and made my escape, still laughing as I ran upstairs. “A good idea!” I thought with glee. “I see I have the means of fretting him out of his melancholy for some time to come.”",

However, I only gave him partial answers because it was too late that evening to go into detail. Also, I didn't want to stir up deep feelings or emotional turmoil in him; my only goal at the moment was to cheer him up. He was cheered, as I mentioned, but not consistently. If the conversation paused for even a moment, he'd become restless, touch me, and then say, \"Jane.\" \"Are you entirely human, Jane? Are you sure about that?\" \"I sincerely believe so, Mr. Rochester.\" \"Then how, on this dark, sorrowful evening, could you appear so suddenly by my lonely fireplace? I reached out for a glass of water from a paid servant, and it was given to me by you. I asked a question expecting John's wife to answer, and your voice spoke right next to me.\" \"Because I had come in, in Mary's place, carrying the tray.\" \"And there's magic in the very hour I'm spending with you now. Who can imagine the dark, miserable, hopeless life I've endured for the past few months? Doing nothing, expecting nothing; blurring day and night; feeling only the cold sensation when the fire went out, and hunger when I forgot to eat. And all the while, a constant sadness, and at times, an absolute frenzy of longing to see my Jane again. Yes, I yearned for her return far more than for the recovery of my lost sight. How can it be that Jane is with me and says she loves me? Won't she vanish as suddenly as she arrived? I fear I'll find her gone tomorrow.\" I was certain that a straightforward, practical response, completely separate from his troubled thoughts, would be the most calming and reassuring thing for him in this state. I ran my finger over his eyebrows and commented that they were singed, and that I would apply something to make them grow back as full and dark as they used to be. \"What's the point of doing me any good, benevolent spirit, when at some fated moment, you'll abandon me again – passing like a shadow, going somewhere and somehow unknown to me, and remaining unreachable afterwards?\" \"Do you have a pocket comb on you, sir?\" \"What for, Jane?\" \"Just to tidy this shaggy black mane. When I examine you close up, I find you quite alarming. You talk about me being a fairy, but honestly, you look more like a goblin.\" \"Am I hideous, Jane?\" \"Very, sir. You always were, you know.\" \"Humph! The wickedness hasn't been purged from you, no matter where you've been.\" \"Yet I've been with good people; far better than you, a hundred times better. People who held ideas and perspectives you've never considered in your life, quite more refined and noble.\" \"Who the devil have you been with?\" \"If you keep twisting like that, you'll make me pull the hair out of your head, and then I think you'll stop doubting that I'm real.\" \"Who have you been with, Jane?\" \"You won't get it out of me tonight, sir. You'll have to wait until tomorrow. Leaving my story half-finished will, you know, be a sort of guarantee that I'll show up at your breakfast table to complete it. By the way, I must remember not to appear by your fireplace with just a glass of water then. I must bring at least an egg, not to mention fried ham.\" \"You teasing shapeshifter – born of fairies and raised by humans! You make me feel things I haven't felt in twelve months. If Saul had had you instead of David, the evil spirit would have been driven out without the need for the harp.\" \"There, sir, you're tidied up and presentable. Now I'll leave you. I've been traveling for the past three days, and I think I'm tired. Good night.\" \"Just one more thing, Jane: were there only women in the house where you've been?\" I laughed and made my escape, still laughing as I ran up the stairs. \"A good strategy!\" I thought gleefully. \"I see I have a way to tease him out of his sadness for quite some time.\" ",

But I kept my answers brief, as it was too late to go into details that evening. I didn’t want to trigger any deep emotions in him; my only goal was to lift his spirits. And he did become more cheerful, although only occasionally. Whenever there was a lull in the conversation, he would get uneasy, reach out for me, and say my name, “Jane.”\n\nHe asked, “Jane, are you really human? Are you sure?”\nI assured him, “I certainly believe so, Mr. Rochester.”\nHe went on, “But how did you suddenly appear tonight, in this dark and miserable hour? I reached for water, expecting a servant, and it was you who handed it to me. I called for John’s wife, but it was your voice I heard.”\nI replied, “I had brought the tray instead of Mary.”\nHe mused, “This very moment feels magical, spending time with you. You can’t imagine what a bleak, empty existence I’ve lived lately—doing nothing, wanting nothing, letting days blur into nights, only feeling cold if the fire went out or hunger if I skipped meals. And then, a constant sadness, and sometimes, a feverish longing to see my Jane again. I wanted you back more than I wanted my sight. How is it possible that you’re here and that you love me? Won’t you disappear as suddenly as you appeared? I fear tomorrow I’ll wake up and you’ll be gone.”\n\nI decided that the best way to comfort him would be to answer in a matter-of-fact way, steering him away from his troubled thoughts. As I ran my fingers over his eyebrows and noted they were singed, I promised to apply something to help them grow back as they were before.\n\nHe asked, “What’s the point of you helping me, generous spirit, if you’re just going to leave again, vanishing like a shadow, impossible for me to find afterward?”\n\nChanging the subject, I asked, “Do you have a pocket-comb, sir?”\n\nHe asked why, and I told him it was so I could tidy his untamed hair, joking that he seemed more like a household brownie than I did a fairy.\n\n“Am I ugly, Jane?” he asked.\n\n“Very much so, sir; as you always have been,” I teased back.\n\nHe scoffed, “So wherever you’ve been, you haven’t lost your impudence.”\n\n“Oh, but I’ve been with excellent people—much better than you, people with refined ways and superior ideas.”\n\n“And who exactly were they?” he asked.\n\n“Be careful or I’ll end up pulling your hair out, and then you certainly won’t doubt I’m real,” I warned as he twisted his head.\n\n“Who have you been with, Jane?” he pressed.\n\nI replied that he’d have to wait until the next day to hear my story in full—that leaving him in suspense would guarantee I’d be there for breakfast to finish it. I joked that next time I’d bring him more than just water—at least an egg, perhaps even some ham.\n\nHe called me a mischievous changeling who’d brought more comfort than he’d felt all year, comparing me to David soothing Saul. Once I’d tidied him up, I said goodnight, explaining I was tired from traveling.\n\nJust before I left, he asked if I’d only been staying with women. I laughed and escaped, still smiling as I went upstairs, pleased with my ability to cheer him up and hopeful that it would last for a while."

Entering the room very softly, I had a view of him before he discovered my presence. It was mournful, indeed, to witness the subjugation of that vigorous spirit to a corporeal infirmity. He sat in his chair—still, but not at rest: expectant evidently; the lines of now habitual sadness marking his strong features. His countenance reminded one of a lamp quenched, waiting to be re-lit—and alas! it was not himself that could now kindle the lustre of animated expression: he was dependent on another for that office!

The lines of sadness, now etched onto his features, marked his strong face. His look made me think of a lamp that had been put out, waiting to be relit – and sadly, he couldn't light up that animated expression himself; he depended on someone else for that task!

What could my darling do, I asked, left destitute and penniless? And what did she do? Let me hear now.”\nThus urged, I began the narrative of my experience for the last year. I softened considerably what related to the three days of wandering and starvation, because to have told him all would have been to inflict unnecessary pain: the little I did say lacerated his faithful heart deeper than I wished.\nI should not have left him thus, he said, without any means of making my way: I should have told him my intention. I should have confided in him: he would never have forced me to be his mistress. Violent as he had seemed in his despair, he, in truth, loved me far too well and too tenderly to constitute himself my tyrant: he would have given me half his fortune, without demanding so much as a kiss in return, rather than I should have flung myself friendless on the wide world. I had endured, he was certain, more than I had confessed to him.\n“Well, whatever my sufferings had been, they were very short,” I answered: and then I proceeded to tell him how I had been received at Moor House; how I had obtained the office of schoolmistress, &c. The accession of fortune, the discovery of my relations, followed in due order. Of course, St. John Rivers’ name came in frequently in the progress of my tale. When I had done, that name was immediately taken up.",

He confessed his pain upon discovering my flight from Thornfield, his inability to find me anywhere, and his realisation, after searching my room, that I had taken neither money nor anything of value. He noted the untouched pearl necklace he had gifted me in its box and my packed trunks left ready for the wedding trip. Wondering what his 'darling' could possibly do, left completely penniless and alone, he demanded to know what I had actually done. Prompted by his urgency, I began recounting my experiences over the past year. I deliberately downplayed the hardships of my initial three days of wandering and hunger, as revealing the full extent would have caused him unnecessary pain; even my partial account deeply wounded his devoted heart. He then told me I should not have left him without any means of support or shared my intentions with him, arguing I should have trusted him, as he would never have forced me to become his mistress. He insisted that despite his seemingly violent despair, he truly loved me too much and too gently to act like a tyrant; he would have given me half his wealth without asking for anything, rather than see me cast myself, friendless, upon the world. He was certain I had endured more suffering than I admitted. I replied, 'Well, whatever my hardships were, they didn't last long,' and proceeded to describe my reception at Moor House, how I secured the position of schoolmistress, and other events. The inheritance and the discovery of my relatives followed in sequence. Naturally, St. John Rivers' name came up often during my story.

Oh, Jane, how I suffered when I realized you had left Thornfield and I couldn’t find you anywhere. When I searched your room, I saw you had taken no money or anything valuable; even the pearl necklace I had given you remained untouched, and your trunks were still packed and locked just as they were for our wedding journey. What would my beloved do, alone and penniless? What did you do? Please, tell me now.\"\n\nPressed by him, I began to recount what had happened to me over the past year. I deliberately downplayed the difficulties I faced during the three days I wandered without food, as telling him everything would have caused unnecessary pain; even the little I shared wounded his loyal heart more than I intended.\n\nHe said I should not have left him like that, with no way to support myself; I should have let him know my plans. I should have trusted him—he insisted he never would have forced me to be his mistress. As desperate as he seemed, he truly loved me too much to have treated me as a tyrant: he would have given me half his wealth, without asking anything in return, rather than see me alone and without friends. He was sure I had been through even more than I had told him.\n\n\"Whatever I suffered, it was brief,\" I replied. Then, I went on to explain how I was welcomed at Moor House, how I found work as a schoolteacher, and so on. I mentioned the inheritance and the discovery of my relatives in order. Naturally, the name of St. John Rivers came up often as I told my story. When I finished, he immediately focused on that name."

St. John was only twenty-nine, sir. Still young, as the French would say. Is he short, unemotional, and unattractive? Someone whose virtue lies more in lacking faults than in possessing great merits? He is ceaselessly energetic. He strives to achieve great and noble deeds. But his intellect? It's likely rather dull, isn't it? He means well, but you dismiss his ideas with a shrug? He speaks little, sir; everything he says is directly relevant. I believe his mind is excellent—not easily swayed, but powerful. Is he capable, then? Truly capable. Thoroughly educated? St. John is a highly accomplished and knowledgeable scholar. You mentioned his manners weren't to your liking, I recall—perhaps pompous and overly clerical? I never commented on his manners; however, they are polished, serene, and gentlemanly, and would suit anyone with even passable taste. His appearance—I forget how you described him; perhaps a sort of inexperienced curate, struggling in his stiff collar and propped up on clunky boots? St. John is well-dressed. He is a handsome man: tall, fair, with blue eyes and a classical profile. (Aside.) Blast him! (To me.) Did you like him, Jane? Yes, Mr. Rochester, I did like him; but you already asked me that. I understood, of course, my questioner's underlying motive. Jealousy had seized him; it pained him, but the pain was beneficial, providing a pause from the consuming anguish of melancholy.

Your words have delineated very prettily a graceful Apollo: he is present to your imagination,—tall, fair, blue-eyed, and with a Grecian profile. Your eyes dwell on a Vulcan,—a real blacksmith, brown, broad-shouldered: and blind and lame into the bargain.”\n“I never thought of it, before; but you certainly are rather like Vulcan, sir.”\n“Well, you can leave me, ma’am: but before you go” (and he retained me by a firmer grasp than ever), “you will be pleased just to answer me a question or two.” He paused.\n“What questions, Mr. Rochester?”\nThen followed this cross-examination.\n“St. John made you schoolmistress of Morton before he knew you were his cousin?”\n“Yes.”\n“You would often see him? He would visit the school sometimes?”\n“Daily.”\n“He would approve of your plans, Jane? I know they would be clever, for you are a talented creature!”\n“He approved of them—yes.”\n“He would discover many things in you he could not have expected to find? Some of your accomplishments are not ordinary.”\n“I don’t know about that.”\n“You had a little cottage near the school, you say: did he ever come there to see you?”\n“Now and then.”\n“Of an evening?”\n“Once or twice.”\nA pause.\n“How long did you reside with him and his sisters after the cousinship was discovered?”\n“Five months.”\n“Did Rivers spend much time with the ladies of his family?”\n“Yes; the back parlour was both his study and ours: he sat near the window, and we by the table.”\n“Did he study much?”\n“A good deal.”\n“What?”\n“Hindostanee.”\n“And what did you do meantime?”\n“I learnt German, at first.”\n“Did he teach you?”\n“He did not understand German.”\n“Did he teach you nothing?”\n“A little Hindostanee.”\n“Rivers taught you Hindostanee?”\n“Yes, sir.”\n“And his sisters also?”\n“No.”\n“Only you?”\n“Only me.”\n“Did you ask to learn?”\n“No.”\n“He wished to teach you?”\n“Yes.”\nA second pause.\n“Why did he wish it? Of what use could Hindostanee be to you?”\n“He intended me to go with him to India.”\n“Ah! here I reach the root of the matter. He wanted you to marry him?”\n“He asked me to marry him.”\n“That is a fiction—an impudent invention to vex me.”\n“I beg your pardon, it is the literal truth: he asked me more than once, and was as stiff about urging his point as ever you could be.”\n“Miss Eyre, I repeat it, you can leave me. How often am I to say the same thing? Why do you remain pertinaciously perched on my knee, when I have given you notice to quit?”\n“Because I am comfortable there.”\n“No, Jane, you are not comfortable there, because your heart is not with me: it is with this cousin—this St. John. Oh, till this moment, I thought my little Jane was all mine! I had a belief she loved me even when she left me: that was an atom of sweet in much bitter. Long as we have been parted, hot tears as I have wept over our separation, I never thought that while I was mourning her, she was loving another! But it is useless grieving. Jane, leave me: go and marry Rivers.”\n“Shake me off, then, sir,—push me away, for I’ll not leave you of my own accord.”\n“Jane, I ever like your tone of voice: it still renews hope, it sounds so truthful. When I hear it, it carries me back a year. I forget that you have formed a new tie. But I am not a fool—go—”\n“Where must I go, sir?”\n“Your own way—with the husband you have chosen.”\n“Who is that?”\n“You know—this St. John Rivers.”\n“He is not my husband, nor ever will be. He does not love me: I do not love him. He loves (as he can love, and that is not as you love) a beautiful young lady called Rosamond. He wanted to marry me only because he thought I should make a suitable missionary’s wife, which she would not have done. He is good and great, but severe; and, for me, cold as an iceberg. He is not like you, sir: I am not happy at his side, nor near him, nor with him. He has no indulgence for me—no fondness. He sees nothing attractive in me; not even youth—only a few useful mental points.—Then I must leave you, sir, to go to him?”\nI shuddered involuntarily, and clung instinctively closer to my blind but beloved master. He smiled.\n“What, Jane! Is this true? Is such really the state of matters between you and Rivers?”\n“Absolutely, sir! Oh, you need not be jealous! I wanted to tease you a little to make you less sad: I thought anger would be better than grief. But if you wish me to love you, could you but see how much I do love you, you would be proud and content. All my heart is yours, sir: it belongs to you; and with you it would remain, were fate to exile the rest of me from your presence for ever.”\nAgain, as he kissed me, painful thoughts darkened his aspect.\n“My seared vision! My crippled strength!” he murmured regretfully.\nI caressed, in order to soothe him. I knew of what he was thinking, and wanted to speak for him, but dared not. As he turned aside his face a minute, I saw a tear slide from under the sealed eyelid, and trickle down the manly cheek. My heart swelled.\n“I am no better than the old lightning-struck chestnut-tree in Thornfield orchard,” he remarked ere long. “And what right would that ruin have to bid a budding woodbine cover its decay with freshness?”\n“You are no ruin, sir—no lightning-struck tree: you are green and vigorous. Plants will grow about your roots, whether you ask them or not, because they take delight in your bountiful shadow; and as they grow they will lean towards you, and wind round you, because your strength offers them so safe a prop.”\nAgain he smiled: I gave him comfort.\n“You speak of friends, Jane?” he asked.\n“Yes, of friends,” I answered rather hesitatingly: for I knew I meant more than friends, but could not tell what other word to employ. He helped me.\n“Ah! Jane. But I want a wife.”\n“Do you, sir?”\n“Yes: is it news to you?”\n“Of course: you said nothing about it before.”\n“Is it unwelcome news?”\n“That depends on circumstances, sir—on your choice.”\n“Which you shall make for me, Jane. I will abide by your decision.”\n“Choose then, sir—her who loves you best.”\n“I will at least choose—her I love best. Jane, will you marry me?”\n“Yes, sir.”\n“A poor blind man, whom you will have to lead about by the hand?”\n“Yes, sir.”\n“A crippled man, twenty years older than you, whom you will have to wait on?”\n“Yes, sir.”\n“Truly, Jane?”\n“Most truly, sir.”\n“Oh! my darling! God bless you and reward you!”\n“Mr. Rochester, if ever I did a good deed in my life—if ever I thought a good thought—if ever I prayed a sincere and blameless prayer—if ever I wished a righteous wish,—I am rewarded now. To be your wife is, for me, to be as happy as I can be on earth.”\n“Because you delight in sacrifice.”\n“Sacrifice! What do I sacrifice? Famine for food, expectation for content. To be privileged to put my arms round what I value—to press my lips to what I love—to repose on what I trust: is that to make a sacrifice? If so, then certainly I delight in sacrifice.”\n“And to bear with my infirmities, Jane: to overlook my deficiencies.”\n“Which are none, sir, to me. I love you better now, when I can really be useful to you, than I did in your state of proud independence, when you disdained every part but that of the giver and protector.”\n“Hitherto I have hated to be helped—to be led: henceforth, I feel I shall hate it no more. I did not like to put my hand into a hireling’s, but it is pleasant to feel it circled by Jane’s little fingers. I preferred utter loneliness to the constant attendance of servants; but Jane’s soft ministry will be a perpetual joy. Jane suits me: do I suit her?”\n“To the finest fibre of my nature, sir.”",
          "paraphrase_gemini-2.5-flash-preview-04-17": "Following this, Mr. Rochester made a rather unexpected remark, 'Perhaps you'd prefer not to remain seated on my knee any longer, Miss Eyre?' I asked why not, to which he responded that the image I had just described presented too stark a contrast. He explained that my words had beautifully portrayed a graceful Apollo, existing in my imagination as tall, fair, blue-eyed, and classically featured. However, my eyes, he noted, were fixed on a Vulcan—a true blacksmith, brown, broad-shouldered, and additionally blind and lame. I admitted I hadn't considered it before but agreed that he was indeed somewhat like Vulcan. He then told me I could leave but held me more firmly than before, stating that I must first answer a few questions. After a pause, I inquired about the questions he had. A series of probing questions ensued. He asked if St. John had appointed me schoolmistress of Morton before knowing I was his cousin, and I confirmed this. He asked if I saw him often and if he visited the school sometimes, to which I replied, 'Daily.' He wondered if St. John approved of my plans, acknowledging my talent, and I said he did. He asked if St. John discovered unexpected qualities in me, noting that some of my skills were unusual, but I expressed uncertainty. He recalled my mention of a small cottage near the school and asked if St. John ever visited me there, and I answered, 'Now and then,' specifically 'Once or twice' in the evening. After another pause, he asked how long I had lived with St. John and his sisters after our kinship was discovered, and I stated, 'Five months.' He inquired if Rivers spent much time with his sisters, and I confirmed that the back parlour served as both his study and theirs, where he sat by the window and we sat by the table. He asked if he studied much, and I said, 'A good deal,' specifying 'Hindostanee' when asked what. In the meantime, I initially learned German, but he did not teach me as he didn't understand it. He then asked if St. John taught me nothing, and I replied, 'A little Hindostanee.' He confirmed that Rivers taught me Hindostanee, and I agreed, adding that he did not teach his sisters, only me. He asked if I requested to learn, and I said no, but he wished to teach me. Another pause followed. He questioned the reason for his wish and the potential use of Hindostanee for me, leading me to reveal that he intended me to go with him to India. 'Ah! here I get to the heart of the matter,' he exclaimed. 'He wanted you to marry him?' I confirmed, 'He asked me to marry him.' He dismissed this as a fabrication, an impudent lie to annoy him. I defended myself, stating, 'I assure you, it is the absolute truth: he asked me more than once, and was just as persistent in pressing his point as you ever could be.' Exasperated, he told me again to leave, asking how many times he needed to say it and why I stubbornly remained perched on his knee after being told to go. I replied, 'Because I am comfortable there.' He disagreed, stating, 'No, Jane, you are not comfortable there, because your heart isn't with me; it's with this cousin—this St. John. Oh, until now, I believed my little Jane was entirely mine! I thought she loved me even when she left; that was a small comfort amidst much sorrow. Despite our long separation and the hot tears I've shed over it, I never imagined that while I grieved for her, she was falling for someone else! But there's no point in dwelling on it. Jane, leave me; go and marry Rivers.' I challenged him, 'Then shake me off, sir,—push me away, for I will not leave on my own.' He responded, 'Jane, I always like the sound of your voice; it still rekindles hope, it sounds so sincere. When I hear it, it takes me back a year. I forget you've formed a new bond. But I am not a fool—go—' I asked where I should go, to which he replied, 'Your own way—with the husband you've chosen.' I inquired who that was, and he specified, 'You know—this St. John Rivers.' I firmly denied, 'He is not my husband, nor ever will be. He does not love me; I do not love him. He loves (in his way, which is not like yours) a beautiful young lady named Rosamond. He only wanted to marry me because he believed I would be a suitable missionary's wife, which she wouldn't have been. He is good and great, but severe; and, to me, as cold as an iceberg. He is not like you, sir: I am not happy at his side, or near him, or with him. He shows me no tenderness—no affection. He finds nothing appealing in me; not even youth—only a few practical mental qualities.—So I must leave you, sir, to go to him?' I involuntarily shivered and instinctively clung tighter to my blind but beloved master. He smiled. 'What, Jane! Is this true? Are things really this way between you and Rivers?' he asked. 'Absolutely, sir!' I affirmed. 'Oh, you needn't be jealous! I just wanted to tease you a little to make you less sad; I thought anger would be better than grief. But if you want me to love you, if you could just see how much I truly do love you, you would be proud and content. All my heart is yours, sir; it belongs to you; and it would remain with you, even if fate were to banish the rest of me from your presence forever.' Again, as he kissed me, painful thoughts clouded his expression. 'My damaged sight! My weakened body!' he murmured with regret. I stroked him to comfort him. I understood what he was thinking and wished to speak for him but didn't dare. As he turned his face away for a moment, I saw a tear escape from under his closed eyelid and roll down his cheek. My heart ached. 'I am no better than the old lightning-struck chestnut-tree in Thornfield orchard,' he remarked shortly after. 'And what right would that ruin have to ask a budding woodbine to cover its decay with freshness?' I countered, 'You are no ruin, sir—no lightning-struck tree: you are healthy and strong. Plants will grow around your roots, whether you ask them to or not, because they find joy in your generous shade; and as they grow, they will lean towards you and wrap around you, because your strength offers them such a secure support.' He smiled again; I had comforted him. 'You speak of friends, Jane?' he asked. 'Yes, of friends,' I replied with some hesitation, knowing I meant more than friends but unable to articulate the other word. He helped me. 'Ah! Jane. But I need a wife.' 'Do you, sir?' I asked. 'Yes: is that news to you?' 'Of course; you didn't mention it before.' 'Is it unwelcome news?' 'That depends on the circumstances, sir—on your choice.' 'Which you will make for me, Jane. I will accept your decision.' 'Then choose, sir—the one who loves you most.' 'I will at least choose—the one I love most. Jane, will you marry me?' 'Yes, sir.' 'A poor blind man, whom you will have to lead by the hand?' 'Yes, sir.' 'A crippled man, twenty years older than you, whom you will have to look after?' 'Yes, sir.' 'Truly, Jane?' 'Most truly, sir.' 'Oh! my dearest! God bless and reward you!' 'Mr. Rochester, if I have ever done a good deed in my life—if I have ever had a good thought—if I have ever offered a sincere and faultless prayer—if I have ever wished a righteous wish,—I am rewarded now. To be your wife is, for me, to be as happy as I possibly can be on earth.' 'Because you find joy in self-denial.' 'Sacrifice! What am I sacrificing? Starvation for nourishment, expectation for contentment. To have the privilege of embracing what I cherish—to kiss what I love—to rely on what I trust: is that making a sacrifice? If so, then indeed I find joy in sacrifice.' 'And to endure my weaknesses, Jane: to overlook my faults.' 'Which are nonexistent to me, sir. I love you more now, when I can truly be useful to you, than I did in your state of proud independence, when you rejected every role but that of giver and protector.' 'Up to now, I have disliked being helped—being led: from now on, I feel I will dislike it no longer. I didn't like putting my hand in a paid servant's, but it is pleasant to feel it encircled by Jane's small fingers. I preferred complete solitude to the constant attention of servants; but Jane's gentle care will be a perpetual delight. Jane suits me: do I suit her?' 'To the very core of my being, sir.'",
          "paraphrase_gpt-4.1-2025-04-14": "Mr. Rochester asks Jane if she'd prefer not to sit on his knee any longer, since she's just described an idealized man like Apollo—tall, fair, and beautiful—while he compares himself to Vulcan, dark and burly and disabled. Jane admits there's some truth to the Vulcan comparison. Rochester tells her she can leave but holds her tighter, saying he has questions. He questions her about her relationship with St. John Rivers—how they worked together before learning they were cousins, if he visited her cottage, and if he taught her anything. Jane explains St. John wanted her to travel to India as his wife and taught her some Hindostanee for that purpose, but he didn't love her in the way Rochester thinks. Jane insists she doesn't love St. John, that their relationship was not romantic; he is cold and only wanted her as a suitable missionary's wife. Rochester is hurt, believing maybe Jane loves St. John instead of him, but Jane assures him her love is for Rochester alone. She tells him she would never leave him willingly, and that her heart truly belongs to him. Rochester despairs over his blindness and disability, viewing himself as ruined, but Jane tells him she sees vitality and strength in him. He regrets being dependent, but Jane insists she loves him more now that she can help him. Rochester finally asks Jane to marry him despite his condition; she joyfully accepts, saying to marry him makes her as happy as she could be. She rejects the idea that this is a sacrifice, saying she delights in loving him and being by his side, and he says he will now be happy to accept her aid, finding joy in her companionship. Both express how perfectly they belong together."

Let me look at your watch.”\n“Fasten it into your girdle, Janet, and keep it henceforward: I have no use for it.”\n“It is nearly four o’clock in the afternoon, sir. Don’t you feel hungry?”\n“The third day from this must be our wedding-day, Jane. Never mind fine clothes and jewels, now: all that is not worth a fillip.”\n“The sun has dried up all the rain-drops, sir. The breeze is still: it is quite hot.”\n“Do you know, Jane, I have your little pearl necklace at this moment fastened round my bronze scrag under my cravat? I have worn it since the day I lost my only treasure, as a memento of her.”\n“We will go home through the wood: that will be the shadiest way.”\nHe pursued his own thoughts without heeding me.\n“Jane! you think me, I daresay, an irreligious dog: but my heart swells with gratitude to the beneficent God of this earth just now. He sees not as man sees, but far clearer: judges not as man judges, but far more wisely. I did wrong: I would have sullied my innocent flower—breathed guilt on its purity: the Omnipotent snatched it from me. I, in my stiff-necked rebellion, almost cursed the dispensation: instead of bending to the decree, I defied it. Divine justice pursued its course; disasters came thick on me: I was forced to pass through the valley of the shadow of death. His chastisements are mighty; and one smote me which has humbled me for ever. You know I was proud of my strength: but what is it now, when I must give it over to foreign guidance, as a child does its weakness? Of late, Jane—only—only of late—I began to see and acknowledge the hand of God in my doom. I began to experience remorse, repentance; the wish for reconcilement to my Maker. I began sometimes to pray: very brief prayers they were, but very sincere.\n“Some days since: nay, I can number them—four; it was last Monday night, a singular mood came over me: one in which grief replaced frenzy—sorrow, sullenness. I had long had the impression that since I could nowhere find you, you must be dead. Late that night—perhaps it might be between eleven and twelve o’clock—ere I retired to my dreary rest, I supplicated God, that, if it seemed good to Him, I might soon be taken from this life, and admitted to that world to come, where there was still hope of rejoining Jane.\n“I was in my own room, and sitting by the window, which was open: it soothed me to feel the balmy night-air; though I could see no stars and only by a vague, luminous haze, knew the presence of a moon. I longed for thee, Janet! Oh, I longed for thee both with soul and flesh! I asked of God, at once in anguish and humility, if I had not been long enough desolate, afflicted, tormented; and might not soon taste bliss and peace once more. That I merited all I endured, I acknowledged—that I could scarcely endure more, I pleaded; and the alpha and omega of my heart’s wishes broke involuntarily from my lips in the words—‘Jane! Jane! Jane!’”\n“Did you speak these words aloud?”\n“I did, Jane. If any listener had heard me, he would have thought me mad: I pronounced them with such frantic energy.”\n“And it was last Monday night, somewhere near midnight?”\n“Yes; but the time is of no consequence: what followed is the strange point. You will think me superstitious,—some superstition I have in my blood, and always had: nevertheless, this is true—true at least it is that I heard what I now relate.\n“As I exclaimed ‘Jane! Jane! Jane!’ a voice—I cannot tell whence the voice came, but I know whose voice it was—replied, ‘I am coming: wait for me;’ and a moment after, went whispering on the wind the words—‘Where are you?’\n“I’ll tell you, if I can, the idea, the picture these words opened to my mind: yet it is difficult to express what I want to express. Ferndean is buried, as you see, in a heavy wood, where sound falls dull, and dies unreverberating. ‘Where are you?’ seemed spoken amongst mountains; for I heard a hill-sent echo repeat the words. Cooler and fresher at the moment the gale seemed to visit my brow: I could have deemed that in some wild, lone scene, I and Jane were meeting. In spirit, I believe we must have met. You no doubt were, at that hour, in unconscious sleep, Jane: perhaps your soul wandered from its cell to comfort mine; for those were your accents—as certain as I live—they were yours!”\nReader, it was on Monday night—near midnight—that I too had received the mysterious summons: those were the very words by which I replied to it. I listened to Mr. Rochester’s narrative, but made no disclosure in return. The coincidence struck me as too awful and inexplicable to be communicated or discussed. If I told anything, my tale would be such as must necessarily make a profound impression on the mind of my hearer: and that mind, yet from its sufferings too prone to gloom, needed not the deeper shade of the supernatural. I kept these things then, and pondered them in my heart.\n“You cannot now wonder,” continued my master, “that when you rose upon me so unexpectedly last night, I had difficulty in believing you any other than a mere voice and vision, something that would melt to silence and annihilation, as the midnight whisper and mountain echo had melted before. Now, I thank God! I know it to be otherwise. Yes, I thank God!”\nHe put me off his knee, rose, and reverently lifting his hat from his brow, and bending his sightless eyes to the earth, he stood in mute devotion. Only the last words of the worship were audible.\n“I thank my Maker, that, in the midst of judgment, he has remembered mercy. I humbly entreat my Redeemer to give me strength to lead henceforth a purer life than I have done hitherto!”\nThen he stretched his hand out to be led. I took that dear hand, held it a moment to my lips, then let it pass round my shoulder: being so much lower of stature than he, I served both for his prop and guide. We entered the wood, and wended homeward.",
          "paraphrase_gemini-2.5-flash-preview-04-17": "Since that is the situation, there is absolutely nothing left to wait for; we must be married immediately. He spoke and looked with great eagerness, his usual impulsiveness resurfacing. 'We must become one flesh without any delay, Jane; the only remaining step is to get the license, and then we'll marry.' 'Mr. Rochester,' I responded, 'I've just noticed the sun is well past its peak, and Pilot has actually gone home for his dinner. Let me see your watch.' He told me to attach it to my belt and keep it from now on, saying he had no need for it. 'It's almost four o'clock in the afternoon, sir. Aren't you hungry?' I asked. 'Our wedding day must be the third day from today, Jane. Don't concern yourself with fancy clothes or jewels now; none of that matters in the least.' 'The sun has dried up all the rain, sir. The breeze has stopped; it's quite warm,' I commented. 'Did you know, Jane,' he said, 'that I currently have your small pearl necklace fastened around my neck under my tie? I've worn it since the day I lost my only treasure, as a reminder of her.' 'We should go home through the woods; that will be the most shaded route,' I suggested. He continued voicing his own thoughts, not listening to me. 'Jane! You probably think I'm an impious fellow, but right now my heart is filled with gratitude towards God. He doesn't see things the way humans do, but much more clearly; he doesn't judge as humans do, but far more wisely. I did wrong; I would have tainted my innocent flower – breathed impurity onto its purity; the Almighty took her away from me. In my stubborn rebellion, I almost cursed the divine arrangement; instead of accepting the decree, I defied it. Divine justice ran its course; misfortunes piled up on me: I was forced to go through great suffering. His punishments are severe, and one struck me that has humbled me forever. You know I was proud of my strength, but what is it worth now, when I must rely on others for guidance, like a child relies on help? Only recently, Jane – just lately – have I begun to recognise and acknowledge God's hand in my destiny. I started to feel remorse, repentance; the desire to be reconciled with my Maker. I even began to pray sometimes; my prayers were very short, but very sincere. A few days ago – no, I can count them – four days; it was last Monday night, a strange feeling came over me: one where grief replaced madness – sorrow replaced gloominess. I had long been convinced that since I couldn't find you anywhere, you must be dead. Late that night – perhaps between eleven and twelve o'clock – before I went to my miserable sleep, I prayed to God that, if it pleased Him, I might soon die and enter the next world, where there was still hope of being reunited with Jane. I was in my room, sitting by the open window; feeling the gentle night air was comforting, even though I couldn't see any stars and only sensed the moon's presence as a faint, glowing mist. I yearned for you, Janet! Oh, I longed for you with all my soul and body! I asked God, in both agony and humility, if I hadn't been lonely, afflicted, and tormented long enough, and if I might not soon taste happiness and peace again. I admitted that I deserved all I had endured, but pleaded that I could barely endure more; and the absolute core of my heart's desires burst out involuntarily from my lips in the words – 'Jane! Jane! Jane!'' 'Did you say these words aloud?' I asked. 'I did, Jane. If anyone had heard me, they would have thought I was insane; I said them with such wild intensity.' 'And it was last Monday night, around midnight?' I questioned. 'Yes; but the exact time doesn't matter; what happened next is the strange part. You will think I'm superstitious – I do have some superstition in my nature, and always have; nevertheless, this is true – at least it's true that I heard what I'm now telling you. As I cried out 'Jane! Jane! Jane!', a voice – I can't say where it came from, but I know whose voice it was – replied, 'I am coming: wait for me;' and a moment later, whispered on the wind the words – 'Where are you?'' It's hard to explain the idea, the image these words created in my mind, yet I'll try. As you see, Ferndean is hidden deep in a dense wood, where sound is muffled and doesn't echo. 'Where are you?' seemed to be spoken among mountains; for I heard a hill-sent echo repeat the words. At that moment, the breeze felt cooler and fresher on my forehead; I could have imagined that in some wild, solitary setting, Jane and I were meeting. In spirit, I believe we must have met. At that hour, Jane, you were no doubt in deep sleep; perhaps your soul left its body to comfort mine; for those were your precise words – as sure as I am alive – they were yours!' Reader, it was on that Monday night – near midnight – that I too had received the mysterious call; those were the very words I used in reply to it. I listened to Mr. Rochester's account but didn't share my own experience. The coincidence felt too profound and inexplicable to reveal or discuss. If I had said anything, my story would necessarily have made a deep impact on his mind, and his mind, still prone to sadness from his suffering, didn't need the added darkness of the supernatural. So, I kept these matters to myself then and reflected on them inwardly. 'Now you can understand,' my master continued, 'why, when you appeared before me so unexpectedly last night, I had difficulty believing you were anything more than just a voice and a vision, something that would disappear into silence and nothingness, just as the midnight whisper and mountain echo had vanished before. Now, I thank God! I know it's not so. Yes, I thank God!' He gently put me off his knee, stood up, and reverently lifted his hat from his head. Bending his sightless eyes towards the ground, he stood in silent prayer. Only the final words of his worship were audible. 'I thank my Creator that, in the midst of judgment, he has remembered mercy. I humbly ask my Redeemer to give me strength to lead a purer life from now on than I have done before!' Then he held out his hand to be guided. I took that dear hand, held it briefly to my lips, then let it rest around my shoulder; being much shorter than him, I served as both his support and his guide.

When we got back from church, I went into the kitchen of the manor-house, where Mary was cooking the dinner and John cleaning the knives, and I said—\n“Mary, I have been married to Mr. Rochester this morning.” The housekeeper and her husband were both of that decent phlegmatic order of people, to whom one may at any time safely communicate a remarkable piece of news without incurring the danger of having one’s ears pierced by some shrill ejaculation, and subsequently stunned by a torrent of wordy wonderment. Mary did look up, and she did stare at me: the ladle with which she was basting a pair of chickens roasting at the fire, did for some three minutes hang suspended in air; and for the same space of time John’s knives also had rest from the polishing process: but Mary, bending again over the roast, said only—\n“Have you, Miss? Well, for sure!”\nA short time after she pursued—“I seed you go out with the master, but I didn’t know you were gone to church to be wed;” and she basted away. John, when I turned to him, was grinning from ear to ear.\n“I telled Mary how it would be,” he said: “I knew what Mr. Edward” (John was an old servant, and had known his master when he was the cadet of the house, therefore, he often gave him his Christian name)—“I knew what Mr. Edward would do; and I was certain he would not wait long neither: and he’s done right, for aught I know. I wish you joy, Miss!” and he politely pulled his forelock.\n“Thank you, John. Mr. Rochester told me to give you and Mary this.” I put into his hand a five-pound note. Without waiting to hear more, I left the kitchen. In passing the door of that sanctum some time after, I caught the words—\n“She’ll happen do better for him nor ony o’ t’ grand ladies.” And again, “If she ben’t one o’ th’ handsomest, she’s noan faâl and varry good-natured; and i’ his een she’s fair beautiful, onybody may see that.”",

I told them, \"Mary, I married Mr. Rochester this morning.\" Both the housekeeper and her husband were remarkably calm and composed people, the sort to whom one can deliver surprising news without fearing loud exclamations or a lengthy outburst of astonishment. Mary did look up and stared at me.

However, Mary soon returned to tending the roast and simply said, \"You did, Miss? Well, indeed!\" A little while later, she added, \"I saw you leave with the master, but I didn't know you were going to church to get married,\" and she continued basting.

I knew what Mr. Edward\" (John was an old servant who knew Mr. Rochester when he was younger and often used his first name) \"I knew what Mr. Edward would do, and I was sure he wouldn't delay it for long. And as far as I can tell, he's made the right decision. Congratulations, Miss!\" He politely touched his forelock. \"Thank you, John,\" I replied. \"Mr. Rochester asked me to give this to you and Mary.\" I placed a five-pound note in his hand. Without waiting for further comments, I left the kitchen. Passing by the door of that familiar room later, I overheard them speaking. I caught the words, \"She'll likely be better for him than any of the important ladies.\" And again, \"Even if she isn't one of the most beautiful, she's not plain and is very kind; and in his eyes, she is truly beautiful, anyone can see that.\"",

Upon returning from the ceremony, I went into the manor's kitchen, where Mary was preparing dinner and John was cleaning knives. I told Mary, \"I was married to Mr. Rochester this morning.\" Both Mary and John were calm, unflappable people who took even surprising news in stride. Mary looked at me in surprise, her ladle midair, and John paused his polishing, but after a moment Mary simply replied, “Did you, miss? Well, that’s something!” Soon after, she commented that she had seen me leave with Mr. Rochester, but hadn’t realized we were going to church to be wed, then continued her work. John, meanwhile, beamed and said he had predicted this might happen, and offered his congratulations. I handed them a five-pound note from Mr. Rochester, then left. Later, as I walked past the kitchen, I overheard them remarking that I might suit Mr. Rochester better than any fine lady would, and though I might not be the most beautiful, I was pleasant-natured, and, in his eyes, very beautiful indeed."

          "text_segment": "As to St. John Rivers, he left England: he went to India. He entered on the path he had marked for himself; he pursues it still. A more resolute, indefatigable pioneer never wrought amidst rocks and dangers. Firm, faithful, and devoted, full of energy, and zeal, and truth, he labours for his race; he clears their painful way to improvement; he hews down like a giant the prejudices of creed and caste that encumber it. He may be stern; he may be exacting; he may be ambitious yet; but his is the sternness of the warrior Greatheart, who guards his pilgrim convoy from the onslaught of Apollyon. His is the exaction of the apostle, who speaks but for Christ, when he says—“Whosoever will come after me, let him deny himself, and take up his cross and follow me.” His is the ambition of the high master-spirit, which aims to fill a place in the first rank of those who are redeemed from the earth—who stand without fault before the throne of God, who share the last mighty victories of the Lamb, who are called, and chosen, and faithful.\nSt. John is unmarried: he never will marry now. Himself has hitherto sufficed to the toil, and the toil draws near its close: his glorious sun hastens to its setting. The last letter I received from him drew from my eyes human tears, and yet filled my heart with divine joy: he anticipated his sure reward, his incorruptible crown. I know that a stranger’s hand will write to me next, to say that the good and faithful servant has been called at length into the joy of his Lord. And why weep for this? No fear of death will darken St. John’s last hour: his mind will be unclouded, his heart will be undaunted, his hope will be sure, his faith steadfast. His own words are a pledge of this—\n“My Master,” he says, “has forewarned me. Daily He announces more distinctly,—‘Surely I come quickly!’ and hourly I more eagerly respond,—‘Amen; even so come, Lord Jesus!’”",
          "paraphrase_gemini-2.5-flash-preview-04-17": "St. John Rivers left England and went to India, where he began and continues to follow the course he set for himself. One could not find a more determined, hardworking pioneer laboring among challenges and perils. Steadfast, loyal, and devoted, full of vigor, enthusiasm, and integrity, he works for his fellow humans, smoothing their difficult path towards progress; he powerfully removes the obstacles of religious and class bias that impede it. He may appear stern, demanding, or still ambitious, but his strictness is like that of the warrior Greatheart guarding his group of pilgrims from attack; his demanding nature is like an apostle speaking purely for Christ, telling followers to give up themselves, take up their cross, and follow him; and his ambition is like that of a high spiritual leader who aims for a top position among those saved from the earth, who stand without sin before God's throne, who partake in the Lamb's final great victories, and who are summoned, chosen, and true. St. John is unmarried and will never marry. He has been enough for the demanding work thus far, and that work is nearing its end; his notable life is approaching its conclusion. The last letter I got from him caused me human sorrow and tears, yet also filled my heart with divine happiness, as he foresaw his certain prize, his crown that will not perish. I expect that someone else's hand will write to me next, to report that the good and faithful servant has finally been called into the joy of his Lord. And why shed tears over this? No dread of dying will cast a shadow over St. John's final hour; his thoughts will be clear, his heart brave, his expectation sure, and his faith firm. His own statements confirm this: he says, 'My Master has informed me in advance. Every day He announces more clearly, \"Surely I am coming soon!\" and each hour I answer with greater eagerness, \"Amen; yes, come, Lord Jesus!\"'",
          "paraphrase_gpt-4.1-2025-04-14": "Regarding St. John Rivers, he left England for India, following the path he had chosen, and continues to pursue it. No one has worked more persistently or bravely among obstacles, rocks, and dangers. He is steadfast, loyal, and dedicated—full of life, enthusiasm, and honesty—as he works tirelessly to benefit others, removing obstacles and prejudices in their way like a strong man clearing a path. He may appear strict, demanding, or ambitious, but his severity is like that of a courageous protector defending his group from danger. His demands resemble those of an apostle who calls others to self-sacrifice and devotion, and his ambitions are those of a noble soul who wants to be among the righteous, faithful, and victorious at the end. St. John is still single and will remain so. He has managed his work alone, which is now nearing completion, and his life is drawing to a close. The last letter I received from him made me cry for human reasons but also rejoice spiritually; he looks forward to his eternal reward. I expect that soon a stranger will write to tell me that this devoted servant has passed on to his ultimate joy. There is no need to mourn, for St. John will face death without fear—clear-minded, courageous, hopeful, and faithful to the end. His own statements confirm this, as he says his Master warns him daily, “Surely I come quickly!” to which St. John eagerly replies, “Amen; even so come, Lord Jesus!”"
