            "Returning to M. Morrel, Dantès elaborates on Captain Leclere's demise, explaining the captain fell ill after leaving Naples in a disturbed state of mind, dying three days later, and was subsequently buried at sea off El Giglio island, with his sword and cross of honor to be delivered to his widow.",
            "Dantès concludes with a poignant, melancholic reflection on the irony of Captain Leclere, a veteran of ten years of war against the English, ultimately dying in his bed like anyone else."

However, those experienced in navigation saw plainly that if any accident had occurred, it was not to the vessel herself, for she bore down with all the evidence of being skilfully handled, the anchor a-cockbill, the jib-boom guys already eased off, and standing by the side of the pilot, who was steering the Pharaon towards the narrow entrance of the inner port, was a young man, who, with activity and vigilant eye, watched every motion of the ship, and repeated each direction of the pilot.\nThe vague disquietude which prevailed among the spectators had so much affected one of the crowd that he did not await the arrival of the vessel in harbor, but jumping into a small skiff, desired to be pulled alongside the Pharaon, which he reached as she rounded into La Réserve basin.\nWhen the young man on board saw this person approach, he left his station by the pilot, and, hat in hand, leaned over the ship’s bulwarks.\nHe was a fine, tall, slim young fellow of eighteen or twenty, with black eyes, and hair as dark as a raven’s wing; and his whole appearance bespoke that calmness and resolution peculiar to men accustomed from their cradle to contend with danger.\n“Ah, is it you, Dantès?” cried the man in the skiff. “What’s the matter? and why have you such an air of sadness aboard?”\n“A great misfortune, M. Morrel,” replied the young man, “a great misfortune, for me especially! Off Civita Vecchia we lost our brave Captain Leclere.”\n“And the cargo?” inquired the owner, eagerly.\n“Is all safe, M. Morrel; and I think you will be satisfied on that head. But poor Captain Leclere——”\n“What happened to him?” asked the owner, with an air of considerable resignation. “What happened to the worthy captain?”\n“He died.”\n“Fell into the sea?”\n“No, sir, he died of brain-fever in dreadful agony.” Then turning to the crew, he said, “Bear a hand there, to take in sail!”\nAll hands obeyed, and at once the eight or ten seamen who composed the crew, sprang to their respective stations at the spanker brails and outhaul, topsail sheets and halyards, the jib downhaul, and the topsail clewlines and buntlines. The young sailor gave a look to see that his orders were promptly and accurately obeyed, and then turned again to the owner.\n“And how did this misfortune occur?” inquired the latter, resuming the interrupted conversation.\n“Alas, sir, in the most unexpected manner. After a long talk with the harbor-master, Captain Leclere left Naples greatly disturbed in mind. In twenty-four hours he was attacked by a fever, and died three days afterwards. We performed the usual burial service, and he is at his rest, sewn up in his hammock with a thirty-six-pound shot at his head and his heels, off El Giglio island. We bring to his widow his sword and cross of honor. It was worth while, truly,” added the young man with a melancholy smile, “to make war against the English for ten years, and to die in his bed at last, like everybody else.”",

He was a man of twenty-five or twenty-six years of age, of unprepossessing countenance, obsequious to his superiors, insolent to his subordinates; and this, in addition to his position as responsible agent on board, which is always obnoxious to the sailors, made him as much disliked by the crew as Edmond Dantès was beloved by them.\n“Well, M. Morrel,” said Danglars, “you have heard of the misfortune that has befallen us?”\n“Yes—yes: poor Captain Leclere! He was a brave and an honest man.”\n“And a first-rate seaman, one who had seen long and honorable service, as became a man charged with the interests of a house so important as that of Morrel & Son,” replied Danglars.\n“But,” replied the owner, glancing after Dantès, who was watching the anchoring of his vessel, “it seems to me that a sailor needs not be so old as you say, Danglars, to understand his business, for our friend Edmond seems to understand it thoroughly, and not to require instruction from anyone.”\n“Yes,” said Danglars, darting at Edmond a look gleaming with hate. “Yes, he is young, and youth is invariably self-confident. Scarcely was the captain’s breath out of his body when he assumed the command without consulting anyone, and he caused us to lose a day and a half at the Island of Elba, instead of making for Marseilles direct.”\n“As to taking command of the vessel,” replied Morrel, “that was his duty as captain’s mate; as to losing a day and a half off the Island of Elba, he was wrong, unless the vessel needed repairs.”\n“The vessel was in as good condition as I am, and as, I hope you are, M.

It was Captain Leclere who gave orders for this delay.”\n“Talking of Captain Leclere, has not Dantès given you a letter from him?”\n“To me?—no—was there one?”\n“I believe that, besides the packet, Captain Leclere confided a letter to his care.”\n“Of what packet are you speaking, Danglars?”\n“Why, that which Dantès left at Porto-Ferrajo.”\n“How do you know he had a packet to leave at Porto-Ferrajo?”\nDanglars turned very red.\n“I was passing close to the door of the captain’s cabin, which was half open, and I saw him give the packet and letter to Dantès.”\n“He did not speak to me of it,” replied the shipowner; “but if there be any letter he will give it to me.”\nDanglars reflected for a moment. “Then, M.

I always knew you were a good son.”\n“And,” inquired Dantès, with some hesitation, “do you know how my father is?”\n“Well, I believe, my dear Edmond, though I have not seen him lately.”\n“Yes, he likes to keep himself shut up in his little room.”\n“That proves, at least, that he has wanted for nothing during your absence.”\nDantès smiled. “My father is proud, sir, and if he had not a meal left, I doubt if he would have asked anything from anyone, except from Heaven.”\n“Well, then, after this first visit has been made we shall count on you.”\n“I must again excuse myself, M. Morrel, for after this first visit has been paid I have another which I am most anxious to pay.”\n“True, Dantès, I forgot that there was at the Catalans someone who expects you no less impatiently than your father—the lovely Mercédès.”\nDantès blushed.\n“Ah, ha,” said the shipowner, “I am not in the least surprised, for she has been to me three times, inquiring if there were any news of the Pharaon. Peste! Edmond, you have a very handsome mistress!”\n“She is not my mistress,” replied the young sailor, gravely; “she is my betrothed.”\n“Sometimes one and the same thing,” said Morrel, with a smile.\n“Not with us, sir,” replied Dantès.\n“Well, well, my dear Edmond,” continued the owner, “don’t let me detain you. You have managed my affairs so well that I ought to allow you all the time you require for your own. Do you want any money?”\n“No, sir; I have all my pay to take—nearly three months’ wages.”\n“You are a careful fellow, Edmond.”\n“Say I have a poor father, sir.”\n“Yes, yes, I know how good a son you are, so now hasten away to see your father. I have a son too, and I should be very wroth with those who detained him from me after a three months’ voyage.”\n“Then I have your leave, sir?”\n“Yes, if you have nothing more to say to me.”\n“Nothing.”\n“Captain Leclere did not, before he died, give you a letter for me?”\n“He was unable to write, sir. But that reminds me that I must ask your leave of absence for some days.”\n“To get married?”\n“Yes, first, and then to go to Paris.”\n“Very good; have what time you require, Dantès. It will take quite six weeks to unload the cargo, and we cannot get you ready for sea until three months after that; only be back again in three months, for the Pharaon,” added the owner, patting the young sailor on the back, “cannot sail without her captain.”\n“Without her captain!” cried Dantès, his eyes sparkling with animation; “pray mind what you say, for you are touching on the most secret wishes of my heart. Is it really your intention to make me captain of the Pharaon?”\n“If I were sole owner we’d shake hands on it now, my dear Dantès, and call it settled; but I have a partner, and you know the Italian proverb—Chi ha compagno ha padrone—‘He who has a partner has a master.’ But the thing is at least half done, as you have one out of two votes. Rely on me to procure you the other; I will do my best.”",

The news of the arrival of the Pharaon had not yet reached the old man, who, mounted on a chair, was amusing himself by training with trembling hand the nasturtiums and sprays of clematis that clambered over the trellis at his window. Suddenly, he felt an arm thrown around his body, and a well-known voice behind him exclaimed, “Father—dear father!”\n\nThe old man uttered a cry, and turned round; then, seeing his son, he fell into his arms, pale and trembling.\n\n“What is the matter, father? Are you ill?” inquired the young man, much alarmed.\n\n“No, no, my dear Edmond—my boy—my son!—no; but I did not expect you; and joy, the surprise of seeing you so suddenly—Ah, I feel as if I were going to die.”\n\n“Come, come, cheer up, my dear father! ’Tis I—really I! They say joy never hurts, and so I came to you without any warning. Come, now, look cheerfully at me, instead of staring as you do. I am back again, and we are going to be happy.”\n\n“Ah, so much the better, my dear boy,” replied the old man; “but how are we to be happy? Are you going to leave me again? Come, tell me all the good fortune that has befallen you.”\n\n“God forgive me,” said the young man, “for rejoicing at happiness derived from the misery of others, but, Heaven knows, I did not seek this good fortune; it has happened, and I am not responsible for it. The good Captain Leclere is dead, father, and it is probable that, with the aid of M. Morrel, I shall have his place. Do you understand, father? Only imagine me a captain at twenty, with a hundred louis pay, and a share in the profits! Is this not more than a poor sailor like me could have hoped for?”\n\n“Yes, my dear boy,” replied the old man, “it is very fortunate.”\n\n“And with my first pay I shall buy you a little house, with a garden in which to plant clematis, nasturtiums, and honeysuckle.

He was a man of twenty-five or six, and held a piece of cloth, which, being a tailor, he was about to make into a coat-lining.\n“What, is it you, Edmond, back again?” said he, with a broad Marseillaise accent, and a grin that displayed his ivory-white teeth.\n“Yes, as you see, neighbor Caderousse; and ready to be agreeable to you in any and every way,” replied Dantès, but ill-concealing his coldness under this cloak of civility.\n“Thanks—thanks; but, fortunately, I do not want for anything; and it chances that at times there are others who have need of me.” Dantès made a gesture. “I do not allude to you, my boy. No!—no! I lent you money, and you returned it; that’s like good neighbors, and we are quits.”\n“We are never quits with those who oblige us,” was Dantès’ reply; “for when we do not owe them money, we owe them gratitude.”\n“What’s the use of mentioning that? What is done is done. Let us talk of your happy return, my boy. I had gone on the quay to match a piece of mulberry cloth, when I met friend Danglars. ‘You at Marseilles?’—‘Yes,’ says he.\n“‘I thought you were at Smyrna.’—‘I was; but am now back again.’\n“‘And where is the dear boy, our little Edmond?’\n“‘Why, with his father, no doubt,’ replied Danglars. And so I came,” added Caderousse, “as fast as I could to have the pleasure of shaking hands with a friend.”\n“Worthy Caderousse!” said the old man, “he is so much attached to us.”\n“Yes, to be sure I am. I love and esteem you, because honest folks are so rare. But it seems you have come back rich, my boy,” continued the tailor, looking askance at the handful of gold and silver which Dantès had thrown on the table.\nThe young man remarked the greedy glance which shone in the dark eyes of his neighbor. “Eh,” he said, negligently, “this money is not mine. I was expressing to my father my fears that he had wanted many things in my absence, and to convince me he emptied his purse on the table. Come, father” added Dantès, “put this money back in your box—unless neighbor Caderousse wants anything, and in that case it is at his service.”\n“No, my boy, no,” said Caderousse. “I am not in any want, thank God, my living is suited to my means. Keep your money—keep it, I say;—one never has too much;—but, at the same time, my boy, I am as much obliged by your offer as if I took advantage of it.”\n“It was offered with good will,” said Dantès.\n“No doubt, my boy; no doubt. Well, you stand well with M. Morrel I hear,—you insinuating dog, you!”\n“M. Morrel has always been exceedingly kind to me,” replied Dantès.\n“Then you were wrong to refuse to dine with him.”\n“What, did you refuse to dine with him?” said old Dantès; “and did he invite you to dine?”\n“Yes, my dear father,” replied Edmond, smiling at his father’s astonishment at the excessive honor paid to his son.\n“And why did you refuse, my son?” inquired the old man.\n“That I might the sooner see you again, my dear father,” replied the young man. “I was most anxious to see you.”\n“But it must have vexed M. Morrel, good, worthy man,” said Caderousse. “And when you are looking forward to be captain, it was wrong to annoy the owner.”\n“But I explained to him the cause of my refusal,” replied Dantès, “and I hope he fully understood it.”\n“Yes, but to be captain one must do a little flattery to one’s patrons.”\n“I hope to be captain without that,” said Dantès.\n“So much the better—so much the better! Nothing will give greater pleasure to all your old friends; and I know one down there behind the Saint Nicolas citadel who will not be sorry to hear it.”\n“Mercédès?” said the old man.\n“Yes, my dear father, and with your permission, now I have seen you, and know you are well and have all you require, I will ask your consent to go and pay a visit to the Catalans.”\n“Go, my dear boy,” said old Dantès; “and Heaven bless you in your wife, as it has blessed me in my son!”\n“His wife!” said Caderousse; “why, how fast you go on, father Dantès; she is not his wife yet, as it seems to me.”\n“No, but according to all probability she soon will be,” replied Edmond.\n“Yes—yes,” said Caderousse; “but you were right to return as soon as possible, my boy.”\n“And why?”\n“Because Mercédès is a very fine girl, and fine girls never lack followers; she particularly has them by dozens.”\n“Really?” answered Edmond, with a smile which had in it traces of slight uneasiness.\n“Ah, yes,” continued Caderousse, “and capital offers, too; but you know, you will be captain, and who could refuse you then?”\n“Meaning to say,” replied Dantès, with a smile which but ill-concealed his trouble, “that if I were not a captain——”\n“Eh—eh!” said Caderousse, shaking his head.\n“Come, come,” said the sailor, “I have a better opinion than you of women in general, and of Mercédès in particular; and I am certain that, captain or not, she will remain ever faithful to me.”\n“So much the better—so much the better,” said Caderousse. “When one is going to be married, there is nothing like implicit confidence; but never mind that, my boy,—go and announce your arrival, and let her know all your hopes and prospects.”\n“I will go directly,” was Edmond’s reply; and, embracing his father, and nodding to Caderousse, he left the apartment.",

MAJOR STRUCTURAL ISSUES:\n- The completion omits a significant portion of the original dialogue and narrative, especially in the latter half. Key exchanges about Dantès' refusal to dine with M. Morrel, the discussion about Mercédès, and Dantès' intention to visit her are missing. The passage ends abruptly, leaving out the resolution and transition to the next scene.\n- The completion invents some internal reflections and descriptions, such as Dantès' \"perception sharpened by his travels\" and Caderousse \"puffing out his chest,\" which are not present in the original.\n\n2. MISSING ELEMENTS:\n- Early on, the completion omits the specific mention of Caderousse's occupation and the item he is holding, which are part of his introduction in the original.\n- The sequence where Caderousse recounts his meeting with Danglars and the conversation about Edmond's whereabouts is condensed and lacks the step-by-step dialogue present in the original.\n- The middle and end of the passage are missing several exchanges: the discussion about Dantès' relationship with M. Morrel, the reason for refusing the dinner invitation, the conversation about Mercédès, and the final moments where Dantès prepares to leave to visit her.\n\n3. INACCURATE ELEMENTS:\n- The completion inaccurately attributes certain attitudes and reflections to Dantès and Caderousse that are not present in the original, such as Dantès' \"perception sharpened by his travels.\"\n- The sequence of events is altered: the completion compresses and rearranges the order of the conversation, particularly regarding the money and Caderousse's motivations.\n- Some character reactions and tones are misrepresented, such as the old man's response to Caderousse and the nature of Dantès' politeness.\n- The completion introduces a more overtly suspicious tone in Dantès' internal assessment of Caderousse, which is not as explicit in the original at this point in the conversation."

Long ago this mysterious colony quitted Spain, and settled on the tongue of land on which it is to this day. Whence it came no one knew, and it spoke an unknown tongue. One of its chiefs, who understood Provençal, begged the commune of Marseilles to give them this bare and barren promontory, where, like the sailors of old, they had run their boats ashore. The request was granted; and three months afterwards, around the twelve or fifteen small vessels which had brought these gypsies of the sea, a small village sprang up. This village, constructed in a singular and picturesque manner, half Moorish, half Spanish, still remains, and is inhabited by descendants of the first comers, who speak the language of their fathers.

Their houses, built in a haphazard fashion against the hillside, were simple and unadorned, reflecting the modest lives of their occupants. From their vantage point, Danglars and Fernand could see the entire village spread out below them. Women mended nets in the doorways, children played in the dusty lanes, and the smell of fish and salt hung heavy in the air. It was a picturesque scene, but for the two men observing it, the village held a singular point of interest: the home of the beautiful Mercédès, the betrothed of their supposed friend, Edmond Dantès."

A young and beautiful girl, with hair as black as jet, her eyes as velvety as the gazelle’s, was leaning with her back against the wainscot, rubbing in her slender delicately moulded fingers a bunch of heath blossoms, the flowers of which she was picking off and strewing on the floor; her arms, bare to the elbow, brown, and modelled after those of the Arlesian Venus, moved with a kind of restless impatience, and she tapped the earth with her arched and supple foot, so as to display the pure and full shape of her well-turned leg, in its red cotton, gray and blue clocked, stocking. At three paces from her, seated in a chair which he balanced on two legs, leaning his elbow on an old worm-eaten table, was a tall young man of twenty, or two-and-twenty, who was looking at her with an air in which vexation and uneasiness were mingled. He questioned her with his eyes, but the firm and steady gaze of the young girl controlled his look.\n“You see, Mercédès,” said the young man, “here is Easter come round again; tell me, is this the moment for a wedding?”\n“I have answered you a hundred times, Fernand, and really you must be very stupid to ask me again.”\n“Well, repeat it,—repeat it, I beg of you, that I may at last believe it! Tell me for the hundredth time that you refuse my love, which had your mother’s sanction. Make me understand once for all that you are trifling with my happiness, that my life or death are nothing to you. Ah, to have dreamed for ten years of being your husband, Mercédès, and to lose that hope, which was the only stay of my existence!”\n“At least it was not I who ever encouraged you in that hope, Fernand,” replied Mercédès; “you cannot reproach me with the slightest coquetry. I have always said to you, ‘I love you as a brother; but do not ask from me more than sisterly affection, for my heart is another’s.’ Is not this true, Fernand?”\n“Yes, that is very true, Mercédès,” replied the young man, “Yes, you have been cruelly frank with me; but do you forget that it is among the Catalans a sacred law to intermarry?”\n“You mistake, Fernand; it is not a law, but merely a custom, and, I pray of you, do not cite this custom in your favor. You are included in the conscription, Fernand, and are only at liberty on sufferance, liable at any moment to be called upon to take up arms. Once a soldier, what would you do with me, a poor orphan, forlorn, without fortune, with nothing but a half-ruined hut and a few ragged nets, the miserable inheritance left by my father to my mother, and by my mother to me? She has been dead a year, and you know, Fernand, I have subsisted almost entirely on public charity. Sometimes you pretend I am useful to you, and that is an excuse to share with me the produce of your fishing, and I accept it, Fernand, because you are the son of my father’s brother, because we were brought up together, and still more because it would give you so much pain if I refuse. But I feel very deeply that this fish which I go and sell, and with the produce of which I buy the flax I spin,—I feel very keenly, Fernand, that this is charity.”\n“And if it were, Mercédès, poor and lone as you are, you suit me as well as the daughter of the first shipowner or the richest banker of Marseilles! What do such as we desire but a good wife and careful housekeeper, and where can I look for these better than in you?”\n“Fernand,” answered Mercédès, shaking her head, “a woman becomes a bad manager, and who shall say she will remain an honest woman, when she loves another man better than her husband? Rest content with my friendship, for I say once more that is all I can promise, and I will promise no more than I can bestow.",

Are you really in such a hurry that you have no time to pass the time of day with your friends?”\n“Particularly when they have still a full bottle before them,” added Danglars. Fernand looked at them both with a stupefied air, but did not say a word.\n“He seems besotted,” said Danglars, pushing Caderousse with his knee. “Are we mistaken, and is Dantès triumphant in spite of all we have believed?”\n“Why, we must inquire into that,” was Caderousse’s reply; and turning towards the young man, said, “Well, Catalan, can’t you make up your mind?”\nFernand wiped away the perspiration steaming from his brow, and slowly entered the arbor, whose shade seemed to restore somewhat of calmness to his senses, and whose coolness somewhat of refreshment to his exhausted body.\n“Good-day,” said he. “You called me, didn’t you?” And he fell, rather than sat down, on one of the seats which surrounded the table.\n“I called you because you were running like a madman, and I was afraid you would throw yourself into the sea,” said Caderousse, laughing. “Why, when a man has friends, they are not only to offer him a glass of wine, but, moreover, to prevent his swallowing three or four pints of water unnecessarily!”\nFernand gave a groan, which resembled a sob, and dropped his head into his hands, his elbows leaning on the table.\n“Well, Fernand, I must say,” said Caderousse, beginning the conversation, with that brutality of the common people in which curiosity destroys all diplomacy, “you look uncommonly like a rejected lover;” and he burst into a hoarse laugh.\n“Bah!” said Danglars, “a lad of his make was not born to be unhappy in love. You are laughing at him, Caderousse.”\n“No,” he replied, “only hark how he sighs! Come, come, Fernand,” said Caderousse, “hold up your head, and answer us. It’s not polite not to reply to friends who ask news of your health.”\n“My health is well enough,” said Fernand, clenching his hands without raising his head.\n“Ah, you see, Danglars,” said Caderousse, winking at his friend, “this is how it is; Fernand, whom you see here, is a good and brave Catalan, one of the best fishermen in Marseilles, and he is in love with a very fine girl, named Mercédès; but it appears, unfortunately, that the fine girl is in love with the mate of the Pharaon; and as the Pharaon arrived today—why, you understand!”\n“No; I do not understand,” said Danglars.\n“Poor Fernand has been dismissed,” continued Caderousse.\n“Well, and what then?” said Fernand, lifting up his head, and looking at Caderousse like a man who looks for someone on whom to vent his anger; “Mercédès is not accountable to any person, is she? Is she not free to love whomsoever she will?”\n“Oh, if you take it in that sense,” said Caderousse, “it is another thing. But I thought you were a Catalan, and they told me the Catalans were not men to allow themselves to be supplanted by a rival. It was even told me that Fernand, especially, was terrible in his vengeance.”\nFernand smiled piteously. “A lover is never terrible,” he said.\n“Poor fellow!” remarked Danglars, affecting to pity the young man from the bottom of his heart. “Why, you see, he did not expect to see Dantès return so suddenly—he thought he was dead, perhaps; or perchance faithless! These things always come on us more severely when they come suddenly.”\n“Ah, ma foi, under any circumstances!” said Caderousse, who drank as he spoke, and on whom the fumes of the wine began to take effect,—“under any circumstances Fernand is not the only person put out by the fortunate arrival of Dantès; is he, Danglars?”\n“No, you are right—and I should say that would bring him ill-luck.”\n“Well, never mind,” answered Caderousse, pouring out a glass of wine for Fernand, and filling his own for the eighth or ninth time, while Danglars had merely sipped his. “Never mind—in the meantime he marries Mercédès—the lovely Mercédès—at least he returns to do that.”\nDuring this time Danglars fixed his piercing glance on the young man, on whose heart Caderousse’s words fell like molten lead.\n“And when is the wedding to be?” he asked.\n“Oh, it is not yet fixed!” murmured Fernand.\n“No, but it will be,” said Caderousse, “as surely as Dantès will be captain of the Pharaon—eh, Danglars?”\nDanglars shuddered at this unexpected attack, and turned to Caderousse, whose countenance he scrutinized, to try and detect whether the blow was premeditated; but he read nothing but envy in a countenance already rendered brutal and stupid by drunkenness.\n“Well,” said he, filling the glasses, “let us drink to Captain Edmond Dantès, husband of the beautiful Catalane!”\nCaderousse raised his glass to his mouth with unsteady hand, and swallowed the contents at a gulp. Fernand dashed his on the ground.\n“Eh, eh, eh!” stammered Caderousse. “What do I see down there by the wall, in the direction of the Catalans? Look, Fernand, your eyes are better than mine. I believe I see double. You know wine is a deceiver; but I should say it was two lovers walking side by side, and hand in hand. Heaven forgive me, they do not know that we can see them, and they are actually embracing!”\nDanglars did not lose one pang that Fernand endured.\n“Do you know them, Fernand?” he said.\n“Yes,” was the reply, in a low voice. “It is Edmond and Mercédès!”\n“Ah, see there, now!” said Caderousse; “and I did not recognize them! Hallo, Dantès! hello, lovely damsel! Come this way, and let us know when the wedding is to be, for Fernand here is so obstinate he will not tell us.”\n“Hold your tongue, will you?” said Danglars, pretending to restrain Caderousse, who, with the tenacity of drunkards, leaned out of the arbor. “Try to stand upright, and let the lovers make love without interruption. See, look at Fernand, and follow his example; he is well-behaved!”\nFernand, probably excited beyond bearing, pricked by Danglars, as the bull is by the bandilleros, was about to rush out; for he had risen from his seat, and seemed to be collecting himself to dash headlong upon his rival, when Mercédès, smiling and graceful, lifted up her lovely head, and looked at them with her clear and bright eyes. At this Fernand recollected her threat of dying if Edmond died, and dropped again heavily on his seat. Danglars looked at the two men, one after the other, the one brutalized by liquor, the other overwhelmed with love.",

You are in a hurry, captain!”\n“Danglars,” said Edmond, smiling, “I will say to you as Mercédès said just now to Caderousse, ‘Do not give me a title which does not belong to me’; that may bring me bad luck.”\n“Your pardon,” replied Danglars, “I merely said you seemed in a hurry, and we have lots of time; the Pharaon cannot be under weigh again in less than three months.”\n“We are always in a hurry to be happy, M. Danglars; for when we have suffered a long time, we have great difficulty in believing in good fortune. But it is not selfishness alone that makes me thus in haste; I must go to Paris.”\n“Ah, really?—to Paris! and will it be the first time you have ever been there, Dantès?”\n“Yes.”\n“Have you business there?”\n“Not of my own; the last commission of poor Captain Leclere; you know to what I allude, Danglars—it is sacred. Besides, I shall only take the time to go and return.”\n“Yes, yes, I understand,” said Danglars, and then in a low tone, he added, “To Paris, no doubt to deliver the letter which the grand marshal gave him. Ah, this letter gives me an idea—a capital idea! Ah; Dantès, my friend, you are not yet registered number one on board the good ship Pharaon;” then turning towards Edmond, who was walking away, “A pleasant journey,” he cried.\n“Thank you,” said Edmond with a friendly nod, and the two lovers continued on their way, as calm and joyous as if they were the very elect of heaven.",

His thin but wiry legs were arrayed in a pair of richly embroidered clocked stockings, evidently of English manufacture, while from his three-cornered hat depended a long streaming knot of white and blue ribbons. Thus he came along, supporting himself on a curiously carved stick, his aged countenance lit up with happiness, looking for all the world like one of the aged dandies of 1796, parading the newly opened gardens of the Luxembourg and Tuileries.\nBeside him glided Caderousse, whose desire to partake of the good things provided for the wedding party had induced him to become reconciled to the Dantès, father and son, although there still lingered in his mind a faint and unperfect recollection of the events of the preceding night; just as the brain retains on waking in the morning the dim and misty outline of a dream.\nAs Danglars approached the disappointed lover, he cast on him a look of deep meaning, while Fernand, as he slowly paced behind the happy pair, who seemed, in their own unmixed content, to have entirely forgotten that such a being as himself existed, was pale and abstracted; occasionally, however, a deep flush would overspread his countenance, and a nervous contraction distort his features, while, with an agitated and restless gaze, he would glance in the direction of Marseilles, like one who either anticipated or foresaw some great and important event.\nDantès himself was simply, but becomingly, clad in the dress peculiar to the merchant service—a costume somewhat between a military and a civil garb; and with his fine countenance, radiant with joy and happiness, a more perfect specimen of manly beauty could scarcely be imagined.\nLovely as the Greek girls of Cyprus or Chios, Mercédès boasted the same bright flashing eyes of jet, and ripe, round, coral lips. She moved with the light, free step of an Arlesienne or an Andalusian. One more practiced in the arts of great cities would have hid her blushes beneath a veil, or, at least, have cast down her thickly fringed lashes, so as to have concealed the liquid lustre of her animated eyes; but, on the contrary, the delighted girl looked around her with a smile that seemed to say: “If you are my friends, rejoice with me, for I am very happy.”",

Morrel descended and came forth to meet it, followed by the soldiers and sailors there assembled, to whom he had repeated the promise already given, that Dantès should be the successor to the late Captain Leclere. Edmond, at the approach of his patron, respectfully placed the arm of his affianced bride within that of M. Morrel, who, forthwith conducting her up the flight of wooden steps leading to the chamber in which the feast was prepared, was gayly followed by the guests, beneath whose heavy tread the slight structure creaked and groaned for the space of several minutes.\n“Father,” said Mercédès, stopping when she had reached the centre of the table, “sit, I pray you, on my right hand; on my left I will place him who has ever been as a brother to me,” pointing with a soft and gentle smile to Fernand; but her words and look seemed to inflict the direst torture on him, for his lips became ghastly pale, and even beneath the dark hue of his complexion the blood might be seen retreating as though some sudden pang drove it back to the heart.\nDuring this time, Dantès, at the opposite side of the table, had been occupied in similarly placing his most honored guests. M. Morrel was seated at his right hand, Danglars at his left; while, at a sign from Edmond, the rest of the company ranged themselves as they found it most agreeable.\nThen they began to pass around the dusky, piquant, Arlesian sausages, and lobsters in their dazzling red cuirasses, prawns of large size and brilliant color, the echinus with its prickly outside and dainty morsel within, the clovis, esteemed by the epicures of the South as more than rivalling the exquisite flavor of the oyster, North. All the delicacies, in fact, that are cast up by the wash of waters on the sandy beach, and styled by the grateful fishermen “fruits of the sea.”\n“A pretty silence truly!” said the old father of the bridegroom, as he carried to his lips a glass of wine of the hue and brightness of the topaz, and which had just been placed before Mercédès herself. “Now, would anybody think that this room contained a happy, merry party, who desire nothing better than to laugh and dance the hours away?”\n“Ah,” sighed Caderousse, “a man cannot always feel happy because he is about to be married.”\n“The truth is,” replied Dantès, “that I am too happy for noisy mirth; if that is what you meant by your observation, my worthy friend, you are right; joy takes a strange effect at times, it seems to oppress us almost the same as sorrow.”\nDanglars looked towards Fernand, whose excitable nature received and betrayed each fresh impression.\n“Why, what ails you?” asked he of Edmond. “Do you fear any approaching evil? I should say that you were the happiest man alive at this instant.”\n“And that is the very thing that alarms me,” returned Dantès. “Man does not appear to me to be intended to enjoy felicity so unmixed; happiness is like the enchanted palaces we read of in our childhood, where fierce, fiery dragons defend the entrance and approach; and monsters of all shapes and kinds, requiring to be overcome ere victory is ours. I own that I am lost in wonder to find myself promoted to an honor of which I feel myself unworthy—that of being the husband of Mercédès.”\n“Nay, nay!” cried Caderousse, smiling, “you have not attained that honor yet. Mercédès is not yet your wife. Just assume the tone and manner of a husband, and see how she will remind you that your hour is not yet come!”\nThe bride blushed, while Fernand, restless and uneasy, seemed to start at every fresh sound, and from time to time wiped away the large drops of perspiration that gathered on his brow.\n“Well, never mind that, neighbor Caderousse; it is not worthwhile to contradict me for such a trifle as that. ’Tis true that Mercédès is not actually my wife; but,” added he, drawing out his watch, “in an hour and a half she will be.”\nA general exclamation of surprise ran round the table, with the exception of the elder Dantès, whose laugh displayed the still perfect beauty of his large white teeth. Mercédès looked pleased and gratified, while Fernand grasped the handle of his knife with a convulsive clutch.\n“In an hour?” inquired Danglars, turning pale. “How is that, my friend?”\n“Why, thus it is,” replied Dantès. “Thanks to the influence of M. Morrel, to whom, next to my father, I owe every blessing I enjoy, every difficulty has been removed. We have purchased permission to waive the usual delay; and at half-past two o’clock the Mayor of Marseilles will be waiting for us at the city hall. Now, as a quarter-past one has already struck, I do not consider I have asserted too much in saying, that, in another hour and thirty minutes Mercédès will have become Madame Dantès.”",

Arrived here only yesterday morning, and married today at three o’clock! Commend me to a sailor for going the quick way to work!”\n“But,” asked Danglars, in a timid tone, “how did you manage about the other formalities—the contract—the settlement?”\n“The contract,” answered Dantès, laughingly, “it didn’t take long to fix that. Mercédès has no fortune; I have none to settle on her. So, you see, our papers were quickly written out, and certainly do not come very expensive.” This joke elicited a fresh burst of applause.\n“So that what we presumed to be merely the betrothal feast turns out to be the actual wedding dinner!” said Danglars.\n“No, no,” answered Dantès; “don’t imagine I am going to put you off in that shabby manner. Tomorrow morning I start for Paris; four days to go, and the same to return, with one day to discharge the commission entrusted to me, is all the time I shall be absent. I shall be back here by the first of March, and on the second I give my real marriage feast.”\nThis prospect of fresh festivity redoubled the hilarity of the guests to such a degree, that the elder Dantès, who, at the commencement of the repast, had commented upon the silence that prevailed, now found it difficult, amid the general din of voices, to obtain a moment’s tranquillity in which to drink to the health and prosperity of the bride and bridegroom.\nDantès, perceiving the affectionate eagerness of his father, responded by a look of grateful pleasure; while Mercédès glanced at the clock and made an expressive gesture to Edmond.\nAround the table reigned that noisy hilarity which usually prevails at such a time among people sufficiently free from the demands of social position not to feel the trammels of etiquette. Such as at the commencement of the repast had not been able to seat themselves according to their inclination rose unceremoniously, and sought out more agreeable companions. Everybody talked at once, without waiting for a reply and each one seemed to be contented with expressing his or her own thoughts.\nFernand’s paleness appeared to have communicated itself to Danglars. As for Fernand himself, he seemed to be enduring the tortures of the damned; unable to rest, he was among the first to quit the table, and, as though seeking to avoid the hilarious mirth that rose in such deafening sounds, he continued, in utter silence, to pace the farther end of the salon.\nCaderousse approached him just as Danglars, whom Fernand seemed most anxious to avoid, had joined him in a corner of the room.\n“Upon my word,” said Caderousse, from whose mind the friendly treatment of Dantès, united with the effect of the excellent wine he had partaken of, had effaced every feeling of envy or jealousy at Dantès’ good fortune,—“upon my word, Dantès is a downright good fellow, and when I see him sitting there beside his pretty wife that is so soon to be. I cannot help thinking it would have been a great pity to have served him that trick you were planning yesterday.”\n“Oh, there was no harm meant,” answered Danglars; “at first I certainly did feel somewhat uneasy as to what Fernand might be tempted to do; but when I saw how completely he had mastered his feelings, even so far as to become one of his rival’s attendants, I knew there was no further cause for apprehension.” Caderousse looked full at Fernand—he was ghastly pale.\n“Certainly,” continued Danglars, “the sacrifice was no trifling one, when the beauty of the bride is concerned. Upon my soul, that future captain of mine is a lucky dog! Gad! I only wish he would let me take his place.”\n“Shall we not set forth?” asked the sweet, silvery voice of Mercédès; “two o’clock has just struck, and you know we are expected in a quarter of an hour.”\n“To be sure!—to be sure!” cried Dantès, eagerly quitting the table; “let us go directly!”\nHis words were re-echoed by the whole party, with vociferous cheers.\nAt this moment Danglars, who had been incessantly observing every change in Fernand’s look and manner, saw him stagger and fall back, with an almost convulsive spasm, against a seat placed near one of the open windows. At the same instant his ear caught a sort of indistinct sound on the stairs, followed by the measured tread of soldiery, with the clanking of swords and military accoutrements; then came a hum and buzz as of many voices, so as to deaden even the noisy mirth of the bridal party, among whom a vague feeling of curiosity and apprehension quelled every disposition to talk, and almost instantaneously the most deathlike stillness prevailed.",

Dantès, perceiving his father's impatience, gave him a look of grateful affection, while Mercédès, with a subtle glance, reminded Edmond that it was getting late. The scene was one of boisterous, informal joy; everyone talked at once, and no one waited for a reply.\n\nAt the other end of the salon, however, Fernand, pale and trembling, had left the table and was pacing silently, avoiding the joyful clamor. Caderousse approached him just as Danglars, whom Fernand seemed to be trying to avoid, came up from the other side.\n\n\"Well,\" said Caderousse, whom the good wine and Dantès' kindness had made communicative, \"it would have been a pity to have carried out that little jest of ours from yesterday. You see, it has all come right without our interference.\"\n\n\"Do you think so?\" said Danglars. \"I was afraid for a moment that he might be harmed, but when I saw him appear with his bride, I was reassured.\"\n\n\"But look at Fernand,\" continued Caderousse. \"He is ghastly pale",

The company looked at each other in consternation.\n“I demand admittance,” said a loud voice outside the room, “in the name of the law!” As no attempt was made to prevent it, the door was opened, and a magistrate, wearing his official scarf, presented himself, followed by four soldiers and a corporal. Uneasiness now yielded to the most extreme dread on the part of those present.\n“May I venture to inquire the reason of this unexpected visit?” said M. Morrel, addressing the magistrate, whom he evidently knew; “there is doubtless some mistake easily explained.”\n“If it be so,” replied the magistrate, “rely upon every reparation being made; meanwhile, I am the bearer of an order of arrest, and although I most reluctantly perform the task assigned me, it must, nevertheless, be fulfilled. Who among the persons here assembled answers to the name of Edmond Dantès?”\nEvery eye was turned towards the young man who, spite of the agitation he could not but feel, advanced with dignity, and said, in a firm voice:\n“I am he; what is your pleasure with me?”\n“Edmond Dantès,” replied the magistrate, “I arrest you in the name of the law!”\n“Me!” repeated Edmond, slightly changing color, “and wherefore, I pray?”\n“I cannot inform you, but you will be duly acquainted with the reasons that have rendered such a step necessary at the preliminary examination.”\nM. Morrel felt that further resistance or remonstrance was useless. He saw before him an officer delegated to enforce the law, and perfectly well knew that it would be as unavailing to seek pity from a magistrate decked with his official scarf, as to address a petition to some cold marble effigy. Old Dantès, however, sprang forward. There are situations which the heart of a father or a mother cannot be made to understand. He prayed and supplicated in terms so moving, that even the officer was touched, and, although firm in his duty, he kindly said, “My worthy friend, let me beg of you to calm your apprehensions. Your son has probably neglected some prescribed form or attention in registering his cargo, and it is more than probable he will be set at liberty directly he has given the information required, whether touching the health of his crew, or the value of his freight.”\n“What is the meaning of all this?” inquired Caderousse, frowningly, of Danglars, who had assumed an air of utter surprise.\n“How can I tell you?” replied he; “I am, like yourself, utterly bewildered at all that is going on, and cannot in the least make out what it is about.” Caderousse then looked around for Fernand, but he had disappeared.\nThe scene of the previous night now came back to his mind with startling clearness. The painful catastrophe he had just witnessed appeared effectually to have rent away the veil which the intoxication of the evening before had raised between himself and his memory.\n“So, so,” said he, in a hoarse and choking voice, to Danglars, “this, then, I suppose, is a part of the trick you were concerting yesterday? All I can say is, that if it be so, ’tis an ill turn, and well deserves to bring double evil on those who have projected it.”\n“Nonsense,” returned Danglars, “I tell you again I have nothing whatever to do with it; besides, you know very well that I tore the paper to pieces.”\n“No, you did not!” answered Caderousse, “you merely threw it by—I saw it lying in a corner.”\n“Hold your tongue, you fool!—what should you know about it?—why, you were drunk!”\n“Where is Fernand?” inquired Caderousse.\n“How do I know?” replied Danglars; “gone, as every prudent man ought to be, to look after his own affairs, most likely. Never mind where he is, let you and I go and see what is to be done for our poor friends.”\nDuring this conversation, Dantès, after having exchanged a cheerful shake of the hand with all his sympathizing friends, had surrendered himself to the officer sent to arrest him, merely saying, “Make yourselves quite easy, my good fellows, there is some little mistake to clear up, that’s all, depend upon it; and very likely I may not have to go so far as the prison to effect that.”\n“Oh, to be sure!” responded Danglars, who had now approached the group, “nothing more than a mistake, I feel quite certain.”\nDantès descended the staircase, preceded by the magistrate, and followed by the soldiers.",

Morrel; “I will take the first conveyance I find, and hurry to Marseilles, whence I will bring you word how all is going on.”\n“That’s right!” exclaimed a multitude of voices, “go, and return as quickly as you can!”\nThis second departure was followed by a long and fearful state of terrified silence on the part of those who were left behind. The old father and Mercédès remained for some time apart, each absorbed in grief; but at length the two poor victims of the same blow raised their eyes, and with a simultaneous burst of feeling rushed into each other’s arms.\nMeanwhile Fernand made his appearance, poured out for himself a glass of water with a trembling hand; then hastily swallowing it, went to sit down at the first vacant place, and this was, by mere chance, placed next to the seat on which poor Mercédès had fallen half fainting, when released from the warm and affectionate embrace of old Dantès. Instinctively Fernand drew back his chair.\n“He is the cause of all this misery—I am quite sure of it,” whispered Caderousse, who had never taken his eyes off Fernand, to Danglars.\n“I don’t think so,” answered the other; “he’s too stupid to imagine such a scheme. I only hope the mischief will fall upon the head of whoever wrought it.”\n“You don’t mention those who aided and abetted the deed,” said Caderousse.\n“Surely,” answered Danglars, “one cannot be held responsible for every chance arrow shot into the air.”\n“You can, indeed, when the arrow lights point downward on somebody’s head.”\nMeantime the subject of the arrest was being canvassed in every different form.\n“What think you, Danglars,” said one of the party, turning towards him, “of this event?”\n“Why,” replied he, “I think it just possible Dantès may have been detected with some trifling article on board ship considered here as contraband.”\n“But how could he have done so without your knowledge, Danglars, since you are the ship’s supercargo?”\n“Why, as for that, I could only know what I was told respecting the merchandise with which the vessel was laden. I know she was loaded with cotton, and that she took in her freight at Alexandria from Pastret’s warehouse, and at Smyrna from Pascal’s; that is all I was obliged to know, and I beg I may not be asked for any further particulars.”\n“Now I recollect,” said the afflicted old father; “my poor boy told me yesterday he had got a small case of coffee, and another of tobacco for me!”\n“There, you see,” exclaimed Danglars. “Now the mischief is out; depend upon it the custom-house people went rummaging about the ship in our absence, and discovered poor Dantès’ hidden treasures.”\nMercédès, however, paid no heed to this explanation of her lover’s arrest. Her grief, which she had hitherto tried to restrain, now burst out in a violent fit of hysterical sobbing.\n“Come, come,” said the old man, “be comforted, my poor child; there is still hope!”\n“Hope!” repeated Danglars.\n“Hope!” faintly murmured Fernand, but the word seemed to die away on his pale agitated lips, and a convulsive spasm passed over his countenance.\n“Good news! good news!” shouted forth one of the party stationed in the balcony on the lookout. “Here comes M. Morrel back. No doubt, now, we shall hear that our friend is released!”\nMercédès and the old man rushed to meet the shipowner and greeted him at the door. He was very pale.\n“What news?” exclaimed a general burst of voices.\n“Alas, my friends,” replied M. Morrel, with a mournful shake of his head, “the thing has assumed a more serious aspect than I expected.”\n“Oh, indeed—indeed, sir, he is innocent!” sobbed forth Mercédès.\n“That I believe!” answered M. Morrel; “but still he is charged——”\n“With what?” inquired the elder Dantès.\n“With being an agent of the Bonapartist faction!” Many of our readers may be able to recollect how formidable such an accusation became in the period at which our story is dated.",

I cannot stay here any longer.”\n“With all my heart!” replied Danglars, pleased to find the other so tractable. “Let us take ourselves out of the way, and leave things for the present to take their course.”\nAfter their departure, Fernand, who had now again become the friend and protector of Mercédès, led the girl to her home, while some friends of Dantès conducted his father, nearly lifeless, to the Allées de Meilhan.",

Morrel, as, on his return to the port for the purpose of gleaning fresh tidings of Dantès, from M. de Villefort, the assistant procureur, he overtook his supercargo and Caderousse. “Could you have believed such a thing possible?”\n“Why, you know I told you,” replied Danglars, “that I considered the circumstance of his having anchored at the Island of Elba as a very suspicious circumstance.”\n“And did you mention these suspicions to any person beside myself?”\n“Certainly not!” returned Danglars. Then added in a low whisper, “You understand that, on account of your uncle, M. Policar Morrel, who served under the other government, and who does not altogether conceal what he thinks on the subject, you are strongly suspected of regretting the abdication of Napoleon. I should have feared to injure both Edmond and yourself, had I divulged my own apprehensions to a soul. I am too well aware that though a subordinate, like myself, is bound to acquaint the shipowner with everything that occurs, there are many things he ought most carefully to conceal from all else.”\n“’Tis well, Danglars—’tis well!” replied M. Morrel. “You are a worthy fellow; and I had already thought of your interests in the event of poor Edmond having become captain of the Pharaon.”\n“Is it possible you were so kind?”\n“Yes, indeed; I had previously inquired of Dantès what was his opinion of you, and if he should have any reluctance to continue you in your post, for somehow I have perceived a sort of coolness between you.”\n“And what was his reply?”\n“That he certainly did think he had given you offence in an affair which he merely referred to without entering into particulars, but that whoever possessed the good opinion and confidence of the ship’s owners would have his preference also.”\n“The hypocrite!” murmured Danglars.\n“Poor Dantès!” said Caderousse. “No one can deny his being a noble-hearted young fellow.”\n“But meanwhile,” continued M. Morrel, “here is the Pharaon without a captain.”\n“Oh,” replied Danglars, “since we cannot leave this port for the next three months, let us hope that ere the expiration of that period Dantès will be set at liberty.”\n“No doubt; but in the meantime?”\n“I am entirely at your service, M. Morrel,” answered Danglars. “You know that I am as capable of managing a ship as the most experienced captain in the service; and it will be so far advantageous to you to accept my services, that upon Edmond’s release from prison no further change will be requisite on board the Pharaon than for Dantès and myself each to resume our respective posts.”\n“Thanks, Danglars—that will smooth over all difficulties. I fully authorize you at once to assume the command of the Pharaon, and look carefully to the unloading of her freight. Private misfortunes must never be allowed to interfere with business.”\n“Be easy on that score, M. Morrel; but do you think we shall be permitted to see our poor Edmond?”\n“I will let you know that directly I have seen M. de Villefort, whom I shall endeavor to interest in Edmond’s favor. I am aware he is a furious royalist; but, in spite of that, and of his being king’s attorney, he is a man like ourselves, and I fancy not a bad sort of one.”\n“Perhaps not,” replied Danglars; “but I hear that he is ambitious, and that’s rather against him.”",

And now I think of it, by Heavens, he may have sent the letter itself! Fortunately, for me, the handwriting was disguised.”\n“Then you were aware of Dantès being engaged in a conspiracy?”\n“Not I.

It seems, however, that I have unconsciously stumbled upon the truth.”\n“Still,” argued Caderousse, “I would give a great deal if nothing of the kind had happened; or, at least, that I had had no hand in it. You will see, Danglars, that it will turn out an unlucky job for both of us.”\n“Nonsense! If any harm come of it, it should fall on the guilty person; and that, you know, is Fernand. How can we be implicated in any way? All we have got to do is, to keep our own counsel, and remain perfectly quiet, not breathing a word to any living soul; and you will see that the storm will pass away without in the least affecting us.”\n“Amen!” responded Caderousse, waving his hand in token of adieu to Danglars, and bending his steps towards the Allées de Meilhan, moving his head to and fro, and muttering as he went, after the manner of one whose mind was overcharged with one absorbing idea.\n“So far, then,” said Danglars, mentally, “all has gone as I would have it. I am, temporarily, commander of the Pharaon, with the certainty of being permanently so, if that fool of a Caderousse can be persuaded to hold his tongue.

I really must pray you to excuse me, but—in truth—I was not attending to the conversation.”\n“Marquise, marquise!” interposed the old nobleman who had proposed the toast, “let the young people alone; let me tell you, on one’s wedding day there are more agreeable subjects of conversation than dry politics.”\n“Never mind, dearest mother,” said a young and lovely girl, with a profusion of light brown hair, and eyes that seemed to float in liquid crystal, “’tis all my fault for seizing upon M. de Villefort, so as to prevent his listening to what you said. But there—now take him—he is your own for as long as you like. M. Villefort, I beg to remind you my mother speaks to you.”\n“If the marquise will deign to repeat the words I but imperfectly caught, I shall be delighted to answer,” said M. de Villefort.\n“Never mind, Renée,” replied the marquise, with a look of tenderness that seemed out of keeping with her harsh dry features; but, however all other feelings may be withered in a woman’s nature, there is always one bright smiling spot in the desert of her heart, and that is the shrine of maternal love. “I forgive you. What I was saying, Villefort, was, that the Bonapartists had not our sincerity, enthusiasm, or devotion.”\n“They had, however, what supplied the place of those fine qualities,” replied the young man, “and that was fanaticism. Napoleon is the Mahomet of the West, and is worshipped by his commonplace but ambitious followers, not only as a leader and lawgiver, but also as the personification of equality.”\n“He!” cried the marquise: “Napoleon the type of equality! For mercy’s sake, then, what would you call Robespierre? Come, come, do not strip the latter of his just rights to bestow them on the Corsican, who, to my mind, has usurped quite enough.”\n“Nay, madame; I would place each of these heroes on his right pedestal—that of Robespierre on his scaffold in the Place Louis Quinze; that of Napoleon on the column of the Place Vendôme. The only difference consists in the opposite character of the equality advocated by these two men; one is the equality that elevates, the other is the equality that degrades; one brings a king within reach of the guillotine, the other elevates the people to a level with the throne. Observe,” said Villefort, smiling, “I do not mean to deny that both these men were revolutionary scoundrels, and that the 9th Thermidor and the 4th of April, in the year 1814, were lucky days for France, worthy of being gratefully remembered by every friend to monarchy and civil order; and that explains how it comes to pass that, fallen, as I trust he is forever, Napoleon has still retained a train of parasitical satellites. Still, marquise, it has been so with other usurpers—Cromwell, for instance, who was not half so bad as Napoleon, had his partisans and advocates.”\n“Do you know, Villefort, that you are talking in a most dreadfully revolutionary strain? But I excuse it, it is impossible to expect the son of a Girondin to be free from a small spice of the old leaven.” A deep crimson suffused the countenance of Villefort.\n“’Tis true, madame,” answered he, “that my father was a Girondin, but he was not among the number of those who voted for the king’s death; he was an equal sufferer with yourself during the Reign of Terror, and had well-nigh lost his head on the same scaffold on which your father perished.”\n“True,” replied the marquise, without wincing in the slightest degree at the tragic remembrance thus called up; “but bear in mind, if you please, that our respective parents underwent persecution and proscription from diametrically opposite principles; in proof of which I may remark, that while my family remained among the staunchest adherents of the exiled princes, your father lost no time in joining the new government; and that while the Citizen Noirtier was a Girondin, the Count Noirtier became a senator.”\n“Dear mother,” interposed Renée, “you know very well it was agreed that all these disagreeable reminiscences should forever be laid aside.”\n“Suffer me, also, madame,” replied Villefort, “to add my earnest request to Mademoiselle de Saint-Méran’s, that you will kindly allow the veil of oblivion to cover and conceal the past. What avails recrimination over matters wholly past recall? For my own part, I have laid aside even the name of my father, and altogether disown his political principles.

Remember, also, Villefort, that we have pledged ourselves to his majesty for your fealty and strict loyalty, and that at our recommendation the king consented to forget the past, as I do” (and here she extended to him her hand)—“as I now do at your entreaty. But bear in mind, that should there fall in your way anyone guilty of conspiring against the government, you will be so much the more bound to visit the offence with rigorous punishment, as it is known you belong to a suspected family.”\n“Alas, madame,” returned Villefort, “my profession, as well as the times in which we live, compels me to be severe. I have already successfully conducted several public prosecutions, and brought the offenders to merited punishment. But we have not done with the thing yet.”\n“Do you, indeed, think so?” inquired the marquise.\n“I am, at least, fearful of it. Napoleon, in the Island of Elba, is too near France, and his proximity keeps up the hopes of his partisans. Marseilles is filled with half-pay officers, who are daily, under one frivolous pretext or other, getting up quarrels with the royalists; from hence arise continual and fatal duels among the higher classes of persons, and assassinations in the lower.”\n“You have heard, perhaps,” said the Comte de Salvieux, one of M. de Saint-Méran’s oldest friends, and chamberlain to the Comte d’Artois, “that the Holy Alliance purpose removing him from thence?”\n“Yes; they were talking about it when we left Paris,” said M. de Saint-Méran; “and where is it decided to transfer him?”\n“To Saint Helena.”\n“For heaven’s sake, where is that?” asked the marquise.\n“An island situated on the other side of the equator, at least two thousand leagues from here,” replied the count.\n“So much the better. As Villefort observes, it is a great act of folly to have left such a man between Corsica, where he was born, and Naples, of which his brother-in-law is king, and face to face with Italy, the sovereignty of which he coveted for his son.”\n“Unfortunately,” said Villefort, “there are the treaties of 1814, and we cannot molest Napoleon without breaking those compacts.”\n“Oh, well, we shall find some way out of it,” responded M. de Salvieux. “There wasn’t any trouble over treaties when it was a question of shooting the poor Duc d’Enghien.”\n“Well,” said the marquise, “it seems probable that, by the aid of the Holy Alliance, we shall be rid of Napoleon; and we must trust to the vigilance of M. de Villefort to purify Marseilles of his partisans.

I have already recorded sentence of death, five or six times, against the movers of political conspiracies, and who can say how many daggers may be ready sharpened, and only waiting a favorable opportunity to be buried in my heart?”\n“Gracious heavens, M. de Villefort,” said Renée, becoming more and more terrified; “you surely are not in earnest.”\n“Indeed I am,” replied the young magistrate with a smile; “and in the interesting trial that young lady is anxious to witness, the case would only be still more aggravated. Suppose, for instance, the prisoner, as is more than probable, to have served under Napoleon—well, can you expect for an instant, that one accustomed, at the word of his commander, to rush fearlessly on the very bayonets of his foe, will scruple more to drive a stiletto into the heart of one he knows to be his personal enemy, than to slaughter his fellow-creatures, merely because bidden to do so by one he is bound to obey? Besides, one requires the excitement of being hateful in the eyes of the accused, in order to lash one’s self into a state of sufficient vehemence and power. I would not choose to see the man against whom I pleaded smile, as though in mockery of my words. No; my pride is to see the accused pale, agitated, and as though beaten out of all composure by the fire of my eloquence.” Renée uttered a smothered exclamation.\n“Bravo!” cried one of the guests; “that is what I call talking to some purpose.”\n“Just the person we require at a time like the present,” said a second.\n“What a splendid business that last case of yours was, my dear Villefort!” remarked a third; “I mean the trial of the man for murdering his father. Upon my word, you killed him ere the executioner had laid his hand upon him.”\n“Oh, as for parricides, and such dreadful people as that,” interposed Renée, “it matters very little what is done to them; but as regards poor unfortunate creatures whose only crime consists in having mixed themselves up in political intrigues——”\n“Why, that is the very worst offence they could possibly commit; for, don’t you see, Renée, the king is the father of his people, and he who shall plot or contrive aught against the life and safety of the parent of thirty-two millions of souls, is a parricide upon a fearfully great scale?”\n“I don’t know anything about that,” replied Renée; “but, M. de Villefort, you have promised me—have you not?—always to show mercy to those I plead for.”\n“Make yourself quite easy on that point,” answered Villefort, with one of his sweetest smiles; “you and I will always consult upon our verdicts.”",

You know we cannot yet pronounce him guilty.”\n“He is in safe custody,” answered Villefort; “and rely upon it, if the letter is found, he will not be likely to be trusted abroad again, unless he goes forth under the especial protection of the headsman.”\n“And where is the unfortunate being?” asked Renée.\n“He is at my house.”\n“Come, come, my friend,” interrupted the marquise, “do not neglect your duty to linger with us. You are the king’s servant, and must go wherever that service calls you.”\n“Oh, Villefort!” cried Renée, clasping her hands, and looking towards her lover with piteous earnestness, “be merciful on this the day of our betrothal.”\nThe young man passed round to the side of the table where the fair pleader sat, and leaning over her chair said tenderly:\n“To give you pleasure, my sweet Renée, I promise to show all the lenity in my power; but if the charges brought against this Bonapartist hero prove correct, why, then, you really must give me leave to order his head to be cut off.”\nRenée shuddered at the word cut, for the growth in question had a head.\n“Never mind that foolish girl, Villefort,” said the marquise. “She will soon get over these things.” So saying, Madame de Saint-Méran extended her dry bony hand to Villefort, who, while imprinting a son-in-law’s respectful salute on it, looked at Renée, as much as to say, “I must try and fancy ’tis your dear hand I kiss, as it should have been.”\n“These are mournful auspices to accompany a betrothal,” sighed poor Renée.\n“Upon my word, child!” exclaimed the angry marquise, “your folly exceeds all bounds. I should be glad to know what connection there can possibly be between your sickly sentimentality and the affairs of the state!”\n“Oh, mother!” murmured Renée.\n“Nay, madame, I pray you pardon this little traitor.

Now, in spite of the nobility of his countenance, the command of which, like a finished actor, he had carefully studied before the glass, it was by no means easy for him to assume an air of judicial severity. Except the recollection of the line of politics his father had adopted, and which might interfere, unless he acted with the greatest prudence, with his own career, Gérard de Villefort was as happy as a man could be. Already rich, he held a high official situation, though only twenty-seven. He was about to marry a young and charming woman, whom he loved, not passionately, but reasonably, as became a deputy attorney of the king; and besides her personal attractions, which were very great, Mademoiselle de Saint-Méran’s family possessed considerable political influence, which they would, of course, exert in his favor. The dowry of his wife amounted to fifty thousand crowns, and he had, besides, the prospect of seeing her fortune increased to half a million at her father’s death. These considerations naturally gave Villefort a feeling of such complete felicity that his mind was fairly dazzled in its contemplation.\nAt the door he met the commissary of police, who was waiting for him. The sight of this officer recalled Villefort from the third heaven to earth; he composed his face, as we have before described, and said, “I have read the letter, sir, and you have acted rightly in arresting this man; now inform me what you have discovered concerning him and the conspiracy.”\n“We know nothing as yet of the conspiracy, monsieur; all the papers found have been sealed up and placed on your desk. The prisoner himself is named Edmond Dantès, mate on board the three-master the Pharaon, trading in cotton with Alexandria and Smyrna, and belonging to Morrel & Son, of Marseilles.”\n“Before he entered the merchant service, had he ever served in the marines?”\n“Oh, no, monsieur, he is very young.”\n“How old?”\n“Nineteen or twenty at the most.”",

He is the most estimable, the most trustworthy creature in the world, and I will venture to say, there is not a better seaman in all the merchant service. Oh, M. de Villefort, I beseech your indulgence for him.”\nVillefort, as we have seen, belonged to the aristocratic party at Marseilles, Morrel to the plebeian; the first was a royalist, the other suspected of Bonapartism. Villefort looked disdainfully at Morrel, and replied coldly:\n“You are aware, monsieur, that a man may be estimable and trustworthy in private life, and the best seaman in the merchant service, and yet be, politically speaking, a great criminal. Is it not true?”\nThe magistrate laid emphasis on these words, as if he wished to apply them to the owner himself, while his eyes seemed to plunge into the heart of one who, interceding for another, had himself need of indulgence. Morrel reddened, for his own conscience was not quite clear on politics; besides, what Dantès had told him of his interview with the grand-marshal, and what the emperor had said to him, embarrassed him. He replied, however, in a tone of deep interest:\n“I entreat you, M. de Villefort, be, as you always are, kind and equitable, and give him back to us soon.” This give us sounded revolutionary in the deputy’s ears.\n“Ah, ah,” murmured he, “is Dantès then a member of some Carbonari society, that his protector thus employs the collective form? He was, if I recollect, arrested in a tavern, in company with a great many others.” Then he added, “Monsieur, you may rest assured I shall perform my duty impartially, and that if he be innocent you shall not have appealed to me in vain; should he, however, be guilty, in this present epoch, impunity would furnish a dangerous example, and I must do my duty.”\nAs he had now arrived at the door of his own house, which adjoined the Palais de Justice, he entered, after having, coldly saluted the shipowner, who stood, as if petrified, on the spot where Villefort had left him.",

When this speech was arranged, Villefort turned to Dantès.\n“Go on, sir,” said he.\n“What would you have me say?”\n“Give all the information in your power.”\n“Tell me on which point you desire information, and I will tell all I know; only,” added he, with a smile, “I warn you I know very little.”\n“Have you served under the usurper?”\n“I was about to be mustered into the Royal Marines when he fell.”\n“It is reported your political opinions are extreme,” said Villefort, who had never heard anything of the kind, but was not sorry to make this inquiry, as if it were an accusation.\n“My political opinions!” replied Dantès. “Alas, sir, I never had any opinions. I am hardly nineteen; I know nothing; I have no part to play. If I obtain the situation I desire, I shall owe it to M. Morrel. Thus all my opinions—I will not say public, but private—are confined to these three sentiments,—I love my father, I respect M. Morrel, and I adore Mercédès. This, sir, is all I can tell you, and you see how uninteresting it is.” As Dantès spoke, Villefort gazed at his ingenuous and open countenance, and recollected the words of Renée, who, without knowing who the culprit was, had besought his indulgence for him. With the deputy’s knowledge of crime and criminals, every word the young man uttered convinced him more and more of his innocence. This lad, for he was scarcely a man,—simple, natural, eloquent with that eloquence of the heart never found when sought for; full of affection for everybody, because he was happy, and because happiness renders even the wicked good—extended his affection even to his judge, spite of Villefort’s severe look and stern accent. Dantès seemed full of kindness.\n“Pardieu!” said Villefort, “he is a noble fellow. I hope I shall gain Renée’s favor easily by obeying the first command she ever imposed on me. I shall have at least a pressure of the hand in public, and a sweet kiss in private.” Full of this idea, Villefort’s face became so joyous, that when he turned to Dantès, the latter, who had watched the change on his physiognomy, was smiling also.",

As for my disposition, that is, perhaps, somewhat too hasty; but I have striven to repress it. I have had ten or twelve sailors under me, and if you question them, they will tell you that they love and respect me, not as a father, for I am too young, but as an elder brother.”\n“But you may have excited jealousy. You are about to become captain at nineteen—an elevated post; you are about to marry a pretty girl, who loves you; and these two pieces of good fortune may have excited the envy of someone.”\n“You are right; you know men better than I do, and what you say may possibly be the case, I confess; but if such persons are among my acquaintances I prefer not to know it, because then I should be forced to hate them.”\n“You are wrong; you should always strive to see clearly around you. You seem a worthy young man; I will depart from the strict line of my duty to aid you in discovering the author of this accusation. Here is the paper; do you know the writing?” As he spoke, Villefort drew the letter from his pocket, and presented it to Dantès. Dantès read it. A cloud passed over his brow as he said:\n“No, monsieur, I do not know the writing, and yet it is tolerably plain. Whoever did it writes well. I am very fortunate,” added he, looking gratefully at Villefort, “to be examined by such a man as you; for this envious person is a real enemy.” And by the rapid glance that the young man’s eyes shot forth, Villefort saw how much energy lay hid beneath this mildness.\n“Now,” said the deputy, “answer me frankly, not as a prisoner to a judge, but as one man to another who takes an interest in him, what truth is there in the accusation contained in this anonymous letter?” And Villefort threw disdainfully on his desk the letter Dantès had just given back to him.\n“None at all. I will tell you the real facts. I swear by my honor as a sailor, by my love for Mercédès, by the life of my father——”\n“Speak, monsieur,” said Villefort. Then, internally, “If Renée could see me, I hope she would be satisfied, and would no longer call me a decapitator.”\n“Well, when we quitted Naples, Captain Leclere was attacked with a brain fever. As we had no doctor on board, and he was so anxious to arrive at Elba, that he would not touch at any other port, his disorder rose to such a height, that at the end of the third day, feeling he was dying, he called me to him. ‘My dear Dantès,’ said he, ‘swear to perform what I am going to tell you, for it is a matter of the deepest importance.’\n“‘I swear, captain,’ replied I.\n“‘Well, as after my death the command devolves on you as mate, assume the command, and bear up for the Island of Elba, disembark at Porto-Ferrajo, ask for the grand-marshal, give him this letter—perhaps they will give you another letter, and charge you with a commission. You will accomplish what I was to have done, and derive all the honor and profit from it.’\n“‘I will do it, captain; but perhaps I shall not be admitted to the grand-marshal’s presence as easily as you expect?’\n“‘Here is a ring that will obtain audience of him, and remove every difficulty,’ said the captain. At these words he gave me a ring. It was time—two hours after he was delirious; the next day he died.”\n“And what did you do then?”\n“What I ought to have done, and what everyone would have done in my place. Everywhere the last requests of a dying man are sacred; but with a sailor the last requests of his superior are commands. I sailed for the Island of Elba, where I arrived the next day; I ordered everybody to remain on board, and went on shore alone. As I had expected, I found some difficulty in obtaining access to the grand-marshal; but I sent the ring I had received from the captain to him, and was instantly admitted. He questioned me concerning Captain Leclere’s death; and, as the latter had told me, gave me a letter to carry on to a person in Paris. I undertook it because it was what my captain had bade me do. I landed here, regulated the affairs of the vessel, and hastened to visit my affianced bride, whom I found more lovely than ever. Thanks to M. Morrel, all the forms were got over; in a word I was, as I told you, at my marriage feast; and I should have been married in an hour, and tomorrow I intended to start for Paris, had I not been arrested on this charge which you as well as I now see to be unjust.”",

The Palais de Justice communicated with the prison,—a sombre edifice, that from its grated windows looks on the clock-tower of the Accoules. After numberless windings, Dantès saw a door with an iron wicket. The commissary took up an iron mallet and knocked thrice, every blow seeming to Dantès as if struck on his heart. The door opened, the two gendarmes gently pushed him forward, and the door closed with a loud sound behind him. The air he inhaled was no longer pure, but thick and mephitic,—he was in prison.\nHe was conducted to a tolerably neat chamber, but grated and barred, and its appearance, therefore, did not greatly alarm him; besides, the words of Villefort, who seemed to interest himself so much, resounded still in his ears like a promise of freedom. It was four o’clock when Dantès was placed in this chamber. It was, as we have said, the 1st of March, and the prisoner was soon buried in darkness. The obscurity augmented the acuteness of his hearing; at the slightest sound he rose and hastened to the door, convinced they were about to liberate him, but the sound died away, and Dantès sank again into his seat. At last, about ten o’clock, and just as Dantès began to despair, steps were heard in the corridor, a key turned in the lock, the bolts creaked, the massy oaken door flew open, and a flood of light from two torches pervaded the apartment.",

The commissary knocked three times; at each knock the hollow sound was repeated, as if there were a corresponding hammer at the other side of the door. At the third knock the door opened, and a man with a sallow face and a forest of black hair, cut short in a fantastic manner, appeared. The commissary whispered a few words in the ear of this man, who, without making any reply, but having first carefully scrutinized the prisoner, made a sign to a turnkey, who was holding a lantern in his hand. Dantès was then pushed into a passage, at the end of which a door opened for him, and then instantly closed upon him. The darkness was complete, but the fresh air of the court had been replaced by a foul, damp, and sickly-smelling atmosphere. He had not taken many steps ere he slipped and fell. A turnkey with a lantern in his hand stood over him. He raised himself up immediately, and looking around, found himself in a square chamber, the walls of which were streaming with a damp, unwholesome-looking fluid. “This is my room for to-night, I suppose?” said Dantès. “That is as may be,” replied the man. “It is a tolerably clean one, and you are not so badly off as the rest.” “I must own that the prospect is not very encouraging,” returned Dantès. “I hope, however, that I shall not be kept here long.” “That is as it may be,” again replied the turnkey. “A bed,” said Dantès. “Of what use is a bed here?” replied the man. “I am very tired, and I should like to sleep.” “There is straw,” said the turnkey; “and he who sleeps on straw, sleeps as sound as on a bed of down.” Dantès made no reply. The man took up the lantern and left him. When the door was again closed, Dantès stretched out his hands, and feeling that the walls were dripping with moisture, he resolved to wrap himself in his coat and lie down on the straw. He was young and strong, and had just been refreshed by a copious meal; he had not, therefore, the anguish of hunger to add to his other sufferings. He lay down, thinking of what could be the reason of his arrest. He had not been long in this position when he heard the noise of a key turning in the lock, and the door, opening, let in a flood of light. By the light of two torches, he saw the sub-governor, who, in his official capacity, had accompanied the commissary. He had a writing-desk in his hand. “Let the prisoner be brought before me,” said he. The turnkey obeyed, and Dantès was brought before this magistrate. “Your name?” said the sub-governor. “Edmond Dantès,” replied the young man. “Your profession?” “Sailor.”",

The two gendarmes who were opposite to him descended first, then he was ordered to alight and the gendarmes on each side of him followed his example. They advanced towards a boat, which a custom-house officer held by a chain, near the quay.\nThe soldiers looked at Dantès with an air of stupid curiosity. In an instant he was placed in the stern-sheets of the boat, between the gendarmes, while the officer stationed himself at the bow; a shove sent the boat adrift, and four sturdy oarsmen impelled it rapidly towards the Pilon. At a shout from the boat, the chain that closes the mouth of the port was lowered and in a second they were, as Dantès knew, in the Frioul and outside the inner harbor.\nThe prisoner’s first feeling was of joy at again breathing the pure air—for air is freedom; but he soon sighed, for he passed before La Réserve, where he had that morning been so happy, and now through the open windows came the laughter and revelry of a ball. Dantès folded his hands, raised his eyes to heaven, and prayed fervently.\nThe boat continued her voyage. They had passed the Tête de Mort, were now off the Anse du Pharo, and about to double the battery. This manœuvre was incomprehensible to Dantès.\n“Whither are you taking me?” asked he.\n“You will soon know.”\n“But still——”\n“We are forbidden to give you any explanation.” Dantès, trained in discipline, knew that nothing would be more absurd than to question subordinates, who were forbidden to reply; and so he remained silent.\nThe most vague and wild thoughts passed through his mind. The boat they were in could not make a long voyage; there was no vessel at anchor outside the harbor; he thought, perhaps, they were going to leave him on some distant point. He was not bound, nor had they made any attempt to handcuff him; this seemed a good augury. Besides, had not the deputy, who had been so kind to him, told him that provided he did not pronounce the dreaded name of Noirtier, he had nothing to apprehend? Had not Villefort in his presence destroyed the fatal letter, the only proof against him?\nHe waited silently, striving to pierce through the darkness.\nThey had left the Ile Ratonneau, where the lighthouse stood, on the right, and were now opposite the Point des Catalans. It seemed to the prisoner that he could distinguish a feminine form on the beach, for it was there Mercédès dwelt. How was it that a presentiment did not warn Mercédès that her lover was within three hundred yards of her?\nOne light alone was visible; and Dantès saw that it came from Mercédès’ chamber. Mercédès was the only one awake in the whole settlement. A loud cry could be heard by her. But pride restrained him and he did not utter it. What would his guards think if they heard him shout like a madman?\nHe remained silent, his eyes fixed upon the light; the boat went on, but the prisoner thought only of Mercédès. An intervening elevation of land hid the light. Dantès turned and perceived that they had got out to sea. While he had been absorbed in thought, they had shipped their oars and hoisted sail; the boat was now moving with the wind.",

This results in the absence of all subsequent actions, dialogue, and internal reflections present in the original passage.\n\n2. MISSING ELEMENTS:\n- The completion lacks the description of the officer's actions after leaving the carriage, including interactions with the guardhouse and soldiers.\n- There is no mention of Dantès' internal questioning or emotional response to the situation.\n- The process of Dantès and the gendarmes leaving the carriage, approaching the boat, and the details of the boat's preparation and departure are missing.\n- The completion omits the atmospheric details, such as the soldiers' demeanor, the movement of the boat, and the environmental cues (e.g., light, air, locations passed).\n- Key locations and landmarks encountered during the boat journey are not referenced.\n- The internal monologue, including Dantès' hopes, fears, and recollections of earlier events, is entirely absent.\n- The emotional climax involving Mercédès and Dantès' restraint is not included.\n- The final transition to the boat's change in movement and the shift to sailing is missing.\n\n3.

One thought in particular tormented him: namely, that during his journey hither he had sat so still, whereas he might, a dozen times, have plunged into the sea, and, thanks to his powers of swimming, for which he was famous, have gained the shore, concealed himself until the arrival of a Genoese or Spanish vessel, escaped to Spain or Italy, where Mercédès and his father could have joined him. He had no fears as to how he should live—good seamen are welcome everywhere. He spoke Italian like a Tuscan, and Spanish like a Castilian; he would have been free, and happy with Mercédès and his father, whereas he was now confined in the Château d’If, that impregnable fortress, ignorant of the future destiny of his father and Mercédès; and all this because he had trusted to Villefort’s promise.

I wish to see him at once.”\n“Ah,” said the jailer, “do not always brood over what is impossible, or you will be mad in a fortnight.”",

The keeper would leave me in the background, and take all the glory to himself. I tell you, marquis, my fortune is made if I only reach the Tuileries the first, for the king will not forget the service I do him.”\n“In that case go and get ready.

Her beauty and high bearing surprised him, and when she inquired what had become of her lover, it seemed to him that she was the judge, and he the accused.\n“The young man you speak of,” said Villefort abruptly, “is a great criminal, and I can do nothing for him, mademoiselle.” Mercédès burst into tears, and, as Villefort strove to pass her, again addressed him.\n“But, at least, tell me where he is, that I may know whether he is alive or dead,” said she.\n“I do not know; he is no longer in my hands,” replied Villefort.\nAnd desirous of putting an end to the interview, he pushed by her, and closed the door, as if to exclude the pain he felt. But remorse is not thus banished; like Virgil’s wounded hero, he carried the arrow in his wound, and, arrived at the salon, Villefort uttered a sigh that was almost a sob, and sank into a chair.\nThen the first pangs of an unending torture seized upon his heart. The man he sacrificed to his ambition, that innocent victim immolated on the altar of his father’s faults, appeared to him pale and threatening, leading his affianced bride by the hand, and bringing with him remorse, not such as the ancients figured, furious and terrible, but that slow and consuming agony whose pangs are intensified from hour to hour up to the very moment of death. Then he had a moment’s hesitation. He had frequently called for capital punishment on criminals, and owing to his irresistible eloquence they had been condemned, and yet the slightest shadow of remorse had never clouded Villefort’s brow, because they were guilty; at least, he believed so; but here was an innocent man whose happiness he had destroyed. In this case he was not the judge, but the executioner.\nAs he thus reflected, he felt the sensation we have described, and which had hitherto been unknown to him, arise in his bosom, and fill him with vague apprehensions. It is thus that a wounded man trembles instinctively at the approach of the finger to his wound until it be healed, but Villefort’s was one of those that never close, or if they do, only close to reopen more agonizing than ever. If at this moment the sweet voice of Renée had sounded in his ears pleading for mercy, or the fair Mercédès had entered and said, “In the name of God, I conjure you to restore me my affianced husband,” his cold and trembling hands would have signed his release; but no voice broke the stillness of the chamber, and the door was opened only by Villefort’s valet, who came to tell him that the travelling carriage was in readiness.",

The lamp went out for want of oil, but she paid no heed to the darkness, and dawn came, but she knew not that it was day. Grief had made her blind to all but one object—that was Edmond.\n“Ah, you are there,” said she, at length, turning towards Fernand.\n“I have not quitted you since yesterday,” returned Fernand sorrowfully.\nM. Morrel had not readily given up the fight. He had learned that Dantès had been taken to prison, and he had gone to all his friends, and the influential persons of the city; but the report was already in circulation that Dantès was arrested as a Bonapartist agent; and as the most sanguine looked upon any attempt of Napoleon to remount the throne as impossible, he met with nothing but refusal, and had returned home in despair, declaring that the matter was serious and that nothing more could be done.\nCaderousse was equally restless and uneasy, but instead of seeking, like M. Morrel, to aid Dantès, he had shut himself up with two bottles of black currant brandy, in the hope of drowning reflection. But he did not succeed, and became too intoxicated to fetch any more drink, and yet not so intoxicated as to forget what had happened. With his elbows on the table he sat between the two empty bottles, while spectres danced in the light of the unsnuffed candle—spectres such as Hoffmann strews over his punch-drenched pages, like black, fantastic dust.\nDanglars alone was content and joyous—he had got rid of an enemy and made his own situation on the Pharaon secure. Danglars was one of those men born with a pen behind the ear, and an inkstand in place of a heart. Everything with him was multiplication or subtraction. The life of a man was to him of far less value than a numeral, especially when, by taking it away, he could increase the sum total of his own desires.

MISSING ELEMENTS:\n- The completion does not include the description of the king's attachment to the table from Hartwell or the specific mention of the king's marginal notes in the book.\n- There is no mention of the courtier's name or title, nor the king's casual attitude while listening.\n- The exchange about the vision of the seven fat and lean kine, the discussion of the political situation in the south, and the king's jesting responses are all missing.\n- The request for sending men to the provinces and the king's Latin quotation are not present.\n- The brief pause while the king writes another note and the final invitation for the courtier to continue are omitted.\n\n3. INACCURATE ELEMENTS:\n- The completion introduces invented details, such as the king sitting in a Voltaire armchair with a gilded eagle and using a mahogany desk of the First Empire, which are not present in the original.\n- The courtier is described as standing and smiling at the king's occupation, which does not match the original depiction of their interaction.\n- The king is described as 'busily engaged' in annotating, which misrepresents the more casual, distracted attitude shown in the original.\n- The sequence of events is altered, with the setting description and character actions not aligning with the original order."

You will find yesterday’s report of the minister of police. But here is M. Dandré himself;” and M. Dandré, announced by the chamberlain-in-waiting, entered.\n“Come in,” said Louis XVIII., with repressed smile, “come in, Baron, and tell the duke all you know—the latest news of M. de Bonaparte; do not conceal anything, however serious,—let us see, the Island of Elba is a volcano, and we may expect to have issuing thence flaming and bristling war—bella, horrida bella.”\nM. Dandré leaned very respectfully on the back of a chair with his two hands, and said:\n“Has your majesty perused yesterday’s report?”\n“Yes, yes; but tell the duke himself, who cannot find anything, what the report contains—give him the particulars of what the usurper is doing in his islet.”\n“Monsieur,” said the baron to the duke, “all the servants of his majesty must approve of the latest intelligence which we have from the Island of Elba. Bonaparte——”\nM. Dandré looked at Louis XVIII., who, employed in writing a note, did not even raise his head. “Bonaparte,” continued the baron, “is mortally wearied, and passes whole days in watching his miners at work at Porto-Longone.”\n“And scratches himself for amusement,” added the king.\n“Scratches himself?” inquired the duke, “what does your majesty mean?”\n“Yes, indeed, my dear duke. Did you forget that this great man, this hero, this demigod, is attacked with a malady of the skin which worries him to death, prurigo?”\n“And, moreover, my dear duke,” continued the minister of police, “we are almost assured that, in a very short time, the usurper will be insane.”\n“Insane?”\n“Raving mad; his head becomes weaker. Sometimes he weeps bitterly, sometimes laughs boisterously, at other time he passes hours on the seashore, flinging stones in the water and when the flint makes ‘duck-and-drake’ five or six times, he appears as delighted as if he had gained another Marengo or Austerlitz. Now, you must agree that these are indubitable symptoms of insanity.”\n“Or of wisdom, my dear baron—or of wisdom,” said Louis XVIII., laughing; “the greatest captains of antiquity amused themselves by casting pebbles into the ocean—see Plutarch’s life of Scipio Africanus.”\nM. de Blacas pondered deeply between the confident monarch and the truthful minister. Villefort, who did not choose to reveal the whole secret, lest another should reap all the benefit of the disclosure, had yet communicated enough to cause him the greatest uneasiness.\n“Well, well, Dandré,” said Louis XVIII., “Blacas is not yet convinced; let us proceed, therefore, to the usurper’s conversion.” The minister of police bowed.\n“The usurper’s conversion!” murmured the duke, looking at the king and Dandré, who spoke alternately, like Virgil’s shepherds. “The usurper converted!”\n“Decidedly, my dear duke.”\n“In what way converted?”\n“To good principles. Tell him all about it, baron.”\n“Why, this is the way of it,” said the minister, with the gravest air in the world: “Napoleon lately had a review, and as two or three of his old veterans expressed a desire to return to France, he gave them their dismissal, and exhorted them to ‘serve the good king.’ These were his own words, of that I am certain.”\n“Well, Blacas, what think you of this?” inquired the king triumphantly, and pausing for a moment from the voluminous scholiast before him.",

I told you Villefort was ambitious, and to attain this ambition Villefort would sacrifice everything, even his father.”\n“Then, sire, may I present him?”\n“This instant, duke! Where is he?”\n“Waiting below, in my carriage.”\n“Seek him at once.”\n“I hasten to do so.”\nThe duke left the royal presence with the speed of a young man; his really sincere royalism made him youthful again.

            "This sailor, Villefort elaborates, had secretly visited Elba, met with the grand-marshal, and was entrusted with an oral message for a Bonapartist contact in Paris. The purpose of this mission, according to the sailor, was to prepare for Napoleon's imminent return. Villefort confirms the sailor is now imprisoned.",

            "Attempting to project composure, Louis XVIII smiles and opines that while conspiracies are easily conceived in the current era, they are difficult to execute successfully. He emphasizes his government's recent re-establishment and heightened vigilance over the past, present, and future, noting his ministers have redoubled their watch over the Mediterranean shores for ten months.",
            "The King outlines scenarios: if Bonaparte landed in Naples, the coalition would mobilize before he could reach Piombino; landing in Tuscany would place him in hostile territory; a landing in France would be with a small force, easily defeated due to his unpopularity. He advises Villefort to take courage and assures him of royal gratitude.",

This person, a sailor, of turbulent character, and whom I suspected of Bonapartism, has been secretly to the Island of Elba. There he saw the grand-marshal, who charged him with an oral message to a Bonapartist in Paris, whose name I could not extract from him; but this mission was to prepare men’s minds for a return (it is the man who says this, sire)—a return which will soon occur.”\n“And where is this man?”\n“In prison, sire.”\n“And the matter seems serious to you?”\n“So serious, sire, that when the circumstance surprised me in the midst of a family festival, on the very day of my betrothal, I left my bride and friends, postponing everything, that I might hasten to lay at your majesty’s feet the fears which impressed me, and the assurance of my devotion.”\n“True,” said Louis XVIII., “was there not a marriage engagement between you and Mademoiselle de Saint-Méran?”\n“Daughter of one of your majesty’s most faithful servants.”\n“Yes, yes; but let us talk of this plot, M. de Villefort.”\n“Sire, I fear it is more than a plot; I fear it is a conspiracy.”\n“A conspiracy in these times,” said Louis XVIII., smiling, “is a thing very easy to meditate, but more difficult to conduct to an end, inasmuch as, re-established so recently on the throne of our ancestors, we have our eyes open at once upon the past, the present, and the future. For the last ten months my ministers have redoubled their vigilance, in order to watch the shore of the Mediterranean. If Bonaparte landed at Naples, the whole coalition would be on foot before he could even reach Piombino; if he land in Tuscany, he will be in an unfriendly territory; if he land in France, it must be with a handful of men, and the result of that is easily foretold, execrated as he is by the population. Take courage, sir; but at the same time rely on our royal gratitude.”\n“Ah, here is M. Dandré!” cried de Blacas. At this instant the minister of police appeared at the door, pale, trembling, and as if ready to faint. Villefort was about to retire, but M. de Blacas, taking his hand, restrained him.",

This conspiracy, plotted by Bonapartists, threatens the very foundation of your government.

Has your uneasiness anything to do with what M. de Blacas has told me, and M. de Villefort has just confirmed?” M. de Blacas moved suddenly towards the baron, but the fright of the courtier pleaded for the forbearance of the statesman; and besides, as matters were, it was much more to his advantage that the prefect of police should triumph over him than that he should humiliate the prefect.\n“Sire,——” stammered the baron.\n“Well, what is it?” asked Louis XVIII. The minister of police, giving way to an impulse of despair, was about to throw himself at the feet of Louis XVIII., who retreated a step and frowned.\n“Will you speak?” he said.\n“Oh, sire, what a dreadful misfortune! I am, indeed, to be pitied. I can never forgive myself!”\n“Monsieur,” said Louis XVIII., “I command you to speak.”\n“Well, sire, the usurper left Elba on the 26th February, and landed on the 1st of March.”\n“And where?

Well, sir, what you tell me is impossible. You must have received a false report, or you have gone mad.”\n“Alas, sire, it is but too true!” Louis made a gesture of indescribable anger and alarm, and then drew himself up as if this sudden blow had struck him at the same moment in heart and countenance.\n“In France!” he cried, “the usurper in France! Then they did not watch over this man. Who knows? they were, perhaps, in league with him.”\n“Oh, sire,” exclaimed the Duc de Blacas, “M. Dandré is not a man to be accused of treason! Sire, we have all been blind, and the minister of police has shared the general blindness, that is all.”\n“But——” said Villefort, and then suddenly checking himself, he was silent; then he continued, “Your pardon, sire,” he said, bowing, “my zeal carried me away. Will your majesty deign to excuse me?”\n“Speak, sir, speak boldly,” replied Louis. “You alone forewarned us of the evil; now try and aid us with the remedy.”\n“Sire,” said Villefort, “the usurper is detested in the south; and it seems to me that if he ventured into the south, it would be easy to raise Languedoc and Provence against him.”\n“Yes, assuredly,” replied the minister; “but he is advancing by Gap and Sisteron.”\n“Advancing—he is advancing!” said Louis XVIII. “Is he then advancing on Paris?” The minister of police maintained a silence which was equivalent to a complete avowal.\n“And Dauphiné, sir?” inquired the king, of Villefort. “Do you think it possible to rouse that as well as Provence?”\n“Sire, I am sorry to tell your majesty a cruel fact; but the feeling in Dauphiné is quite the reverse of that in Provence or Languedoc. The mountaineers are Bonapartists, sire.”\n“Then,” murmured Louis, “he was well informed. And how many men had he with him?”\n“I do not know, sire,” answered the minister of police.\n“What, you do not know! Have you neglected to obtain information on that point? Of course it is of no consequence,” he added, with a withering smile.\n“Sire, it was impossible to learn; the despatch simply stated the fact of the landing and the route taken by the usurper.”\n“And how did this despatch reach you?” inquired the king. The minister bowed his head, and while a deep color overspread his cheeks, he stammered out:\n“By the telegraph, sire.” Louis XVIII. advanced a step, and folded his arms over his chest as Napoleon would have done.\n“So then,” he exclaimed, turning pale with anger, “seven conjoined and allied armies overthrew that man. A miracle of heaven replaced me on the throne of my fathers after five-and-twenty years of exile. I have, during those five-and-twenty years, spared no pains to understand the people of France and the interests which were confided to me; and now, when I see the fruition of my wishes almost within reach, the power I hold in my hands bursts and shatters me to atoms!”\n“Sire, it is fatality!” murmured the minister, feeling that the pressure of circumstances, however light a thing to destiny, was too much for any human strength to endure.\n“What our enemies say of us is then true. We have learnt nothing, forgotten nothing! If I were betrayed as he was, I would console myself; but to be in the midst of persons elevated by myself to places of honor, who ought to watch over me more carefully than over themselves,—for my fortune is theirs—before me they were nothing—after me they will be nothing, and perish miserably from incapacity—ineptitude!

Sire, we have all been blind, and the minister of police has shared the general blindness, that is all.”\n\n“But,”—said Villefort, and then suddenly checking himself, he was silent; then he continued, “Your pardon, sire,” he said, bowing, “my zeal has surpassed my duty. I pray your majesty to forgive me.”\n\n“Speak, sir, speak boldly,” said the king. “You alone forewarned us of the evil; now try and aid us with the remedy.”\n\n“Sire,” said Villefort, “the usurper is detested in the south; and it seems to me that if he ventured into the south, it would be easy to raise Languedoc and Provence against him.”\n\n“Yes, assuredly,” said the minister; “but he is advancing by Gap and Sisteron.”\n\n“Advancing! he is advancing!” cried the king. “Is he then advancing on Paris?”\n\nThe minister of police maintained a silence which was equivalent to a complete avowal.\n\n“And Dauphiné, sir?” asked the king, of Villefort. “Do you think it possible to rouse that province?”\n\n“Sire, I am sorry to tell your majesty a cruel fact; but the feeling in Dauphiné is quite the reverse of that in Provence or Languedoc. The mountaineers are all Bonapartists, sire.”\n\n“Then,” murmured the king, “he was well informed. And how many men had he with him?”\n\n“I do not know, sire,” answered the minister of police.\n\n“What, you do not know! You have neglected to obtain this",

          "text_segment": "The minister quailed before this outburst of sarcasm. M. de Blacas wiped the moisture from his brow. Villefort smiled within himself, for he felt his increased importance.\n“To fall,” continued King Louis, who at the first glance had sounded the abyss on which the monarchy hung suspended,—“to fall, and learn of that fall by telegraph! Oh, I would rather mount the scaffold of my brother, Louis XVI., than thus descend the staircase at the Tuileries driven away by ridicule. Ridicule, sir—why, you know not its power in France, and yet you ought to know it!”\n“Sire, sire,” murmured the minister, “for pity’s——”\n“Approach, M. de Villefort,” resumed the king, addressing the young man, who, motionless and breathless, was listening to a conversation on which depended the destiny of a kingdom. “Approach, and tell monsieur that it is possible to know beforehand all that he has not known.”\n“Sire, it was really impossible to learn secrets which that man concealed from all the world.”\n“Really impossible! Yes—that is a great word, sir. Unfortunately, there are great words, as there are great men; I have measured them. Really impossible for a minister who has an office, agents, spies, and fifteen hundred thousand francs for secret service money, to know what is going on at sixty leagues from the coast of France! Well, then, see, here is a gentleman who had none of these resources at his disposal—a gentleman, only a simple magistrate, who learned more than you with all your police, and who would have saved my crown, if, like you, he had the power of directing a telegraph.” The look of the minister of police was turned with concentrated spite on Villefort, who bent his head in modest triumph.\n“I do not mean that for you, Blacas,” continued Louis XVIII.; “for if you have discovered nothing, at least you have had the good sense to persevere in your suspicions. Any other than yourself would have considered the disclosure of M. de Villefort insignificant, or else dictated by venal ambition.” These words were an allusion to the sentiments which the minister of police had uttered with so much confidence an hour before.\nVillefort understood the king’s intent. Any other person would, perhaps, have been overcome by such an intoxicating draught of praise; but he feared to make for himself a mortal enemy of the police minister, although he saw that Dandré was irrevocably lost. In fact, the minister, who, in the plenitude of his power, had been unable to unearth Napoleon’s secret, might in despair at his own downfall interrogate Dantès and so lay bare the motives of Villefort’s plot. Realizing this, Villefort came to the rescue of the crest-fallen minister, instead of aiding to crush him.\n“Sire,” said Villefort, “the suddenness of this event must prove to your majesty that the issue is in the hands of Providence; what your majesty is pleased to attribute to me as profound perspicacity is simply owing to chance, and I have profited by that chance, like a good and devoted servant—that’s all. Do not attribute to me more than I deserve, sire, that your majesty may never have occasion to recall the first opinion you have been pleased to form of me.” The minister of police thanked the young man by an eloquent look, and Villefort understood that he had succeeded in his design; that is to say, that without forfeiting the gratitude of the king, he had made a friend of one on whom, in case of necessity, he might rely.",

He chose a path of diplomacy.\\n\\n“Sire,” said Villefort, “the rapidity of the event must prove to your majesty that God alone was capable of averting it. What your majesty is pleased to attribute to me as profound perspicacity is simply the result of chance. I am, Sire, a loyal and devoted servant, and nothing more. Do not, I beg, give me a reputation for foresight which might, in the future, cause your majesty to be disappointed.”\\n\\nThe minister of police, who had not lost a word of this, gave Villefort a look of profound gratitude.

Yet, speaking of reports, baron, what have you learned with regard to the affair in the Rue Saint-Jacques?”\n“The affair in the Rue Saint-Jacques!” exclaimed Villefort, unable to repress an exclamation. Then, suddenly pausing, he added, “Your pardon, sire, but my devotion to your majesty has made me forget, not the respect I have, for that is too deeply engraved in my heart, but the rules of etiquette.”\n“Go on, go on, sir,” replied the king; “you have today earned the right to make inquiries here.”\n“Sire,” interposed the minister of police, “I came a moment ago to give your majesty fresh information which I had obtained on this head, when your majesty’s attention was attracted by the terrible event that has occurred in the gulf, and now these facts will cease to interest your majesty.”\n“On the contrary, sir,—on the contrary,” said Louis XVIII., “this affair seems to me to have a decided connection with that which occupies our attention, and the death of General Quesnel will, perhaps, put us on the direct track of a great internal conspiracy.” At the name of General Quesnel, Villefort trembled.\n“Everything points to the conclusion, sire,” said the minister of police, “that death was not the result of suicide, as we first believed, but of assassination. General Quesnel, it appears, had just left a Bonapartist club when he disappeared. An unknown person had been with him that morning, and made an appointment with him in the Rue Saint-Jacques; unfortunately, the general’s valet, who was dressing his hair at the moment when the stranger entered, heard the street mentioned, but did not catch the number.” As the police minister related this to the king, Villefort, who looked as if his very life hung on the speaker’s lips, turned alternately red and pale. The king looked towards him.\n“Do you not think with me, M. de Villefort, that General Quesnel, whom they believed attached to the usurper, but who was really entirely devoted to me, has perished the victim of a Bonapartist ambush?”\n“It is probable, sire,” replied Villefort. “But is this all that is known?”\n“They are on the track of the man who appointed the meeting with him.”\n“On his track?” said Villefort.\n“Yes, the servant has given his description. He is a man of from fifty to fifty-two years of age, dark, with black eyes covered with shaggy eyebrows, and a thick moustache. He was dressed in a blue frock-coat, buttoned up to the chin, and wore at his button-hole the rosette of an officer of the Legion of Honor. Yesterday a person exactly corresponding with this description was followed, but he was lost sight of at the corner of the Rue de la Jussienne and the Rue Coq-Héron.” Villefort leaned on the back of an armchair, for as the minister of police went on speaking he felt his legs bend under him; but when he learned that the unknown had escaped the vigilance of the agent who followed him, he breathed again.\n“Continue to seek for this man, sir,” said the king to the minister of police; “for if, as I am all but convinced, General Quesnel, who would have been so useful to us at this moment, has been murdered, his assassins, Bonapartists or not, shall be cruelly punished.” It required all Villefort’s coolness not to betray the terror with which this declaration of the king inspired him.",

MISSING ELEMENTS:\n- Early in the passage, the completion does not include the king's instructions for Villefort to rest after his journey or the inquiry about whether Villefort stopped at his father's residence.\n- The sequence involving the king's presentation of a decoration, Villefort's reaction, and the administrative follow-up is missing.\n- The final actions—Villefort leaving, his interaction with the minister of police, and his departure by coach—are absent.\n\n3.

Why didn’t they search more vigilantly? they would have found——”\n“They have not found; but they are on the track.”\n“Yes, that the usual phrase; I am quite familiar with it. When the police is at fault, it declares that it is on the track; and the government patiently awaits the day when it comes to say, with a sneaking air, that the track is lost.”\n“Yes, but they have found a corpse; the general has been killed, and in all countries they call that a murder.”\n“A murder do you call it? why, there is nothing to prove that the general was murdered. People are found every day in the Seine, having thrown themselves in, or having been drowned from not knowing how to swim.”\n“Father, you know very well that the general was not a man to drown himself in despair, and people do not bathe in the Seine in the month of January. No, no, do not be deceived; this was murder in every sense of the word.”\n“And who thus designated it?”\n“The king himself.”\n“The king! I thought he was philosopher enough to allow that there was no murder in politics. In politics, my dear fellow, you know, as well as I do, there are no men, but ideas—no feelings, but interests; in politics we do not kill a man, we only remove an obstacle, that is all. Would you like to know how matters have progressed? Well, I will tell you. It was thought reliance might be placed in General Quesnel; he was recommended to us from the Island of Elba; one of us went to him, and invited him to the Rue Saint-Jacques, where he would find some friends. He came there, and the plan was unfolded to him for leaving Elba, the projected landing, etc. When he had heard and comprehended all to the fullest extent, he replied that he was a royalist. Then all looked at each other,—he was made to take an oath, and did so, but with such an ill grace that it was really tempting Providence to swear thus, and yet, in spite of that, the general was allowed to depart free—perfectly free. Yet he did not return home. What could that mean? why, my dear fellow, that on leaving us he lost his way, that’s all. A murder? really, Villefort, you surprise me. You, a deputy procureur, to found an accusation on such bad premises! Did I ever say to you, when you were fulfilling your character as a royalist, and cut off the head of one of my party, ‘My son, you have committed a murder?’ No, I said, ‘Very well, sir, you have gained the victory; tomorrow, perchance, it will be our turn.’”\n",

Villefort, therefore, gained nothing save the king’s gratitude (which was rather likely to injure him at the present time) and the cross of the Legion of Honor, which he had the prudence not to wear, although M. de Blacas had duly forwarded the brevet.\nNapoleon would, doubtless, have deprived Villefort of his office had it not been for Noirtier, who was all powerful at court, and thus the Girondin of ’93 and the Senator of 1806 protected him who so lately had been his protector.

The miraculous return of Napoleon has conquered me, the legitimate monarch is he who is loved by his people.”\n“That’s right!” cried Morrel. “I like to hear you speak thus, and I augur well for Edmond from it.”\n“Wait a moment,” said Villefort, turning over the leaves of a register; “I have it—a sailor, who was about to marry a young Catalan girl. I recollect now; it was a very serious charge.”\n“How so?”\n“You know that when he left here he was taken to the Palais de Justice.”\n“Well?”\n“I made my report to the authorities at Paris, and a week after he was carried off.”\n“Carried off!” said Morrel. “What can they have done with him?”\n“Oh, he has been taken to Fenestrelles, to Pignerol, or to the Sainte-Marguérite islands.

It seems to me the first care of government should be to set at liberty those who have suffered for their adherence to it.”\n“Do not be too hasty, M. Morrel,” replied Villefort. “The order of imprisonment came from high authority, and the order for his liberation must proceed from the same source; and, as Napoleon has scarcely been reinstated a fortnight, the letters have not yet been forwarded.”\n“But,” said Morrel, “is there no way of expediting all these formalities—of releasing him from arrest?”\n“There has been no arrest.”\n“How?”\n“It is sometimes essential to government to cause a man’s disappearance without leaving any traces, so that no written forms or documents may defeat their wishes.”\n“It might be so under the Bourbons, but at present——”\n“It has always been so, my dear Morrel, since the reign of Louis XIV.

But when Napoleon returned to Paris, Danglars’ heart failed him, and he lived in constant fear of Dantès’ return on a mission of vengeance. He therefore informed M.

Only, during the respite the absence of his rival afforded him, he reflected, partly on the means of deceiving Mercédès as to the cause of his absence, partly on plans of emigration and abduction, as from time to time he sat sad and motionless on the summit of Cape Pharo, at the spot from whence Marseilles and the Catalans are visible, watching for the apparition of a young and handsome man, who was for him also the messenger of vengeance.

At the sound of the key turning in the lock, and the creaking of the hinges, Dantès, who was crouched in a corner of the dungeon, whence he could see the ray of light that came through a narrow iron grating above, raised his head. Seeing a stranger, escorted by two turnkeys holding torches and accompanied by two soldiers, and to whom the governor spoke bareheaded, Dantès, who guessed the truth, and that the moment to address himself to the superior authorities was come, sprang forward with clasped hands.\nThe soldiers interposed their bayonets, for they thought that he was about to attack the inspector, and the latter recoiled two or three steps. Dantès saw that he was looked upon as dangerous. Then, infusing all the humility he possessed into his eyes and voice, he addressed the inspector, and sought to inspire him with pity.\nThe inspector listened attentively; then, turning to the governor, observed, “He will become religious—he is already more gentle; he is afraid, and retreated before the bayonets—madmen are not afraid of anything; I made some curious observations on this at Charenton.” Then, turning to the prisoner, “What is it you want?” said he.\n“I want to know what crime I have committed—to be tried; and if I am guilty, to be shot; if innocent, to be set at liberty.”\n“Are you well fed?” said the inspector.\n“I believe so; I don’t know; it’s of no consequence. What matters really, not only to me, but to officers of justice and the king, is that an innocent man should languish in prison, the victim of an infamous denunciation, to die here cursing his executioners.”\n“You are very humble today,” remarked the governor; “you are not so always; the other day, for instance, when you tried to kill the turnkey.”\n“It is true, sir, and I beg his pardon, for he has always been very good to me, but I was mad.”\n“And you are not so any longer?”\n“No; captivity has subdued me—I have been here so long.”\n“So long?—when were you arrested, then?” asked the inspector.\n“The 28th of February, 1815, at half-past two in the afternoon.”\n“Today is the 30th of July, 1816,—why, it is but seventeen months.”\n“Only seventeen months,” replied Dantès. “Oh, you do not know what is seventeen months in prison!—seventeen ages rather, especially to a man who, like me, had arrived at the summit of his ambition—to a man, who, like me, was on the point of marrying a woman he adored, who saw an honorable career opened before him, and who loses all in an instant—who sees his prospects destroyed, and is ignorant of the fate of his affianced wife, and whether his aged father be still living! Seventeen months’ captivity to a sailor accustomed to the boundless ocean, is a worse punishment than human crime ever merited. Have pity on me, then, and ask for me, not intelligence, but a trial; not pardon, but a verdict—a trial, sir, I ask only for a trial; that, surely, cannot be denied to one who is accused!”\n“We shall see,” said the inspector; then, turning to the governor, “On my word, the poor devil touches me. You must show me the proofs against him.”\n“Certainly; but you will find terrible charges.”\n“Monsieur,” continued Dantès, “I know it is not in your power to release me; but you can plead for me—you can have me tried—and that is all I ask. Let me know my crime, and the reason why I was condemned. Uncertainty is worse than all.”\n“Go on with the lights,” said the inspector.\n“Monsieur,” cried Dantès, “I can tell by your voice you are touched with pity; tell me at least to hope.”\n“I cannot tell you that,” replied the inspector; “I can only promise to examine into your case.”\n“Oh, I am free—then I am saved!”\n“Who arrested you?”\n“M. Villefort. See him, and hear what he says.”\n“M. Villefort is no longer at Marseilles; he is now at Toulouse.”\n“I am no longer surprised at my detention,” murmured Dantès, “since my only protector is removed.”\n“Had M. de Villefort any cause of personal dislike to you?”\n“None; on the contrary, he was very kind to me.”\n“I can, then, rely on the notes he has left concerning you?”\n“Entirely.”\n“That is well; wait patiently, then.”\nDantès fell on his knees, and prayed earnestly. The door closed; but this time a fresh inmate was left with Dantès—Hope.",

He was drawing in this circle geometrical lines, and seemed as much absorbed in his problem as Archimedes was when the soldier of Marcellus slew him. He did not move at the sound of the door, and continued his calculations until the flash of the torches lighted up with an unwonted glare the sombre walls of his cell; then, raising his head, he perceived with astonishment the number of persons present. He hastily seized the coverlet of his bed, and wrapped it round him.\n“What is it you want?” said the inspector.\n“I, monsieur,” replied the abbé with an air of surprise,—“I want nothing.”\n“You do not understand,” continued the inspector; “I am sent here by government to visit the prison, and hear the requests of the prisoners.”\n“Oh, that is different,” cried the abbé; “and we shall understand each other, I hope.”\n“There, now,” whispered the governor, “it is just as I told you.”\n“Monsieur,” continued the prisoner, “I am the Abbé Faria, born at Rome. I was for twenty years Cardinal Spada’s secretary; I was arrested, why, I know not, toward the beginning of the year 1811; since then I have demanded my liberty from the Italian and French government.”\n“Why from the French government?”\n“Because I was arrested at Piombino, and I presume that, like Milan and Florence, Piombino has become the capital of some French department.”\n“Ah,” said the inspector, “you have not the latest news from Italy?”\n“My information dates from the day on which I was arrested,” returned the Abbé Faria; “and as the emperor had created the kingdom of Rome for his infant son, I presume that he has realized the dream of Machiavelli and Cæsar Borgia, which was to make Italy a united kingdom.”\n“Monsieur,” returned the inspector, “Providence has changed this gigantic plan you advocate so warmly.”\n“It is the only means of rendering Italy strong, happy, and independent.”\n“Very possibly; only I am not come to discuss politics, but to inquire if you have anything to ask or to complain of.”\n“The food is the same as in other prisons,—that is, very bad; the lodging is very unhealthful, but, on the whole, passable for a dungeon; but it is not that which I wish to speak of, but a secret I have to reveal of the greatest importance.”\n“We are coming to the point,” whispered the governor.\n“It is for that reason I am delighted to see you,” continued the abbé, “although you have disturbed me in a most important calculation, which, if it succeeded, would possibly change Newton’s system. Could you allow me a few words in private.”\n“What did I tell you?” said the governor.\n“You knew him,” returned the inspector with a smile.\n“What you ask is impossible, monsieur,” continued he, addressing Faria.\n“But,” said the abbé, “I would speak to you of a large sum, amounting to five millions.”\n“The very sum you named,” whispered the inspector in his turn.",

Had not government better profit by it? I will offer six millions, and I will content myself with the rest, if they will only give me my liberty.”\n“On my word,” said the inspector in a low tone, “had I not been told beforehand that this man was mad, I should believe what he says.”\n“I am not mad,” replied Faria, with that acuteness of hearing peculiar to prisoners. “The treasure I speak of really exists, and I offer to sign an agreement with you, in which I promise to lead you to the spot where you shall dig; and if I deceive you, bring me here again,—I ask no more.”\nThe governor laughed. “Is the spot far from here?”\n“A hundred leagues.”\n“It is not ill-planned,” said the governor. “If all the prisoners took it into their heads to travel a hundred leagues, and their guardians consented to accompany them, they would have a capital chance of escaping.”\n“The scheme is well known,” said the inspector; “and the abbé’s plan has not even the merit of originality.”\nThen turning to Faria, “I inquired if you are well fed?” said he.\n“Swear to me,” replied Faria, “to free me if what I tell you prove true, and I will stay here while you go to the spot.”\n“Are you well fed?” repeated the inspector.\n“Monsieur, you run no risk, for, as I told you, I will stay here; so there is no chance of my escaping.”\n“You do not reply to my question,” replied the inspector impatiently.\n“Nor you to mine,” cried the abbé. “You will not accept my gold; I will keep it for myself. You refuse me my liberty; God will give it me.” And the abbé, casting away his coverlet, resumed his place, and continued his calculations.\n“What is he doing there?” said the inspector.\n“Counting his treasures,” replied the governor.\nFaria replied to this sarcasm with a glance of profound contempt. They went out. The turnkey closed the door behind them.\n“He was wealthy once, perhaps?” said the inspector.\n“Or dreamed he was, and awoke mad.”\n“After all,” said the inspector, “if he had been rich, he would not have been here.”\nSo the matter ended for the Abbé Faria.

He was sustained at first by that pride of conscious innocence which is the sequence to hope; then he began to doubt his own innocence, which justified in some measure the governor’s belief in his mental alienation; and then, relaxing his sentiment of pride, he addressed his supplications, not to God, but to man. God is always the last resource. Unfortunates, who ought to begin with God, do not have any hope in him till they have exhausted all other means of deliverance.\nDantès asked to be removed from his present dungeon into another, even if it were darker and deeper, for a change, however disadvantageous, was still a change, and would afford him some amusement. He entreated to be allowed to walk about, to have fresh air, books, and writing materials. His requests were not granted, but he went on asking all the same. He accustomed himself to speaking to the new jailer, although the latter was, if possible, more taciturn than the old one; but still, to speak to a man, even though mute, was something. Dantès spoke for the sake of hearing his own voice; he had tried to speak when alone, but the sound of his voice terrified him.\nOften, before his captivity, Dantès’ mind had revolted at the idea of assemblages of prisoners, made up of thieves, vagabonds, and murderers. He now wished to be amongst them, in order to see some other face besides that of his jailer; he sighed for the galleys, with the infamous costume, the chain, and the brand on the shoulder. The galley-slaves breathed the fresh air of heaven, and saw each other. They were very happy.\nHe besought the jailer one day to let him have a companion, were it even the mad abbé. The jailer, though rough and hardened by the constant sight of so much suffering, was yet a man. At the bottom of his heart he had often had a feeling of pity for this unhappy young man who suffered so; and he laid the request of number 34 before the governor; but the latter sapiently imagined that Dantès wished to conspire or attempt an escape, and refused his request. Dantès had exhausted all human resources, and he then turned to God.",

In the darkness of his cell, he would conjure the image of his beautiful Mercédès, her dark eyes filled with tears, waiting for him at the Catalan village. He thought of his aged father, whose sole support he was, and a pang of anguish, sharper than any physical pain, shot through his heart. Surely, they would not let him languish here for a simple misunderstanding. But the days melted into weeks, and the weeks into months, with no word, no visitor, no sign that the world beyond his stone walls even remembered his existence. The silence from the Château d'If was more terrifying than any accusation. Hope, that tenacious companion, began to fray, its bright colors fading into the gray monotony of his confinement. It was then that a burning fever of rage seized him. He would hurl himself against the unyielding stone, his throat raw from screaming curses at his jailers, at the magistrate, at the God who had seemingly abandoned him. This paroxysm of fury was followed by a prostration of spirit so profound it bordered on idiocy. He ceased to count the days, to mark the changing light that filtered through his high-set window. He lay upon his foul straw pallet, a breathing corpse, his mind a vacant chamber where memories, once sharp and painful, now flickered like dying embers. The names of his enemies, once seared into his brain, faded into a dull, persistent ache. He had been promised a swift"

Dantès was a man of great simplicity of thought, and without education; he could not, therefore, in the solitude of his dungeon, traverse in mental vision the history of the ages, bring to life the nations that had perished, and rebuild the ancient cities so vast and stupendous in the light of the imagination, and that pass before the eye glowing with celestial colors in Martin’s Babylonian pictures. He could not do this, he whose past life was so short, whose present so melancholy, and his future so doubtful. Nineteen years of light to reflect upon in eternal darkness! No distraction could come to his aid; his energetic spirit, that would have exalted in thus revisiting the past, was imprisoned like an eagle in a cage. He clung to one idea—that of his happiness, destroyed, without apparent cause, by an unheard-of fatality; he considered and reconsidered this idea, devoured it (so to speak), as the implacable Ugolino devours the skull of Archbishop Roger in the Inferno of Dante.\nRage supplanted religious fervor. Dantès uttered blasphemies that made his jailer recoil with horror, dashed himself furiously against the walls of his prison, wreaked his anger upon everything, and chiefly upon himself, so that the least thing,—a grain of sand, a straw, or a breath of air that annoyed him, led to paroxysms of fury. Then the letter that Villefort had showed to him recurred to his mind, and every line gleamed forth in fiery letters on the wall like the mene, mene, tekel upharsin of Belshazzar. He told himself that it was the enmity of man, and not the vengeance of Heaven, that had thus plunged him into the deepest misery. He consigned his unknown persecutors to the most horrible tortures he could imagine, and found them all insufficient, because after torture came death, and after death, if not repose, at least the boon of unconsciousness.",

Unhappy he, who, on the brink of misfortune, broods over ideas like these!\nBefore him is a dead sea that stretches in azure calm before the eye; but he who unwarily ventures within its embrace finds himself struggling with a monster that would drag him down to perdition. Once thus ensnared, unless the protecting hand of God snatch him thence, all is over, and his struggles but tend to hasten his destruction. This state of mental anguish is, however, less terrible than the sufferings that precede or the punishment that possibly will follow. There is a sort of consolation at the contemplation of the yawning abyss, at the bottom of which lie darkness and obscurity.\nEdmond found some solace in these ideas. All his sorrows, all his sufferings, with their train of gloomy spectres, fled from his cell when the angel of death seemed about to enter. Dantès reviewed his past life with composure, and, looking forward with terror to his future existence, chose that middle line that seemed to afford him a refuge.\n“Sometimes,” said he, “in my voyages, when I was a man and commanded other men, I have seen the heavens overcast, the sea rage and foam, the storm arise, and, like a monstrous bird, beating the two horizons with its wings. Then I felt that my vessel was a vain refuge, that trembled and shook before the tempest. Soon the fury of the waves and the sight of the sharp rocks announced the approach of death, and death then terrified me, and I used all my skill and intelligence as a man and a sailor to struggle against the wrath of God. But I did so because I was happy, because I had not courted death, because to be cast upon a bed of rocks and seaweed seemed terrible, because I was unwilling that I, a creature made for the service of God, should serve for food to the gulls and ravens. But now it is different; I have lost all that bound me to life, death smiles and invites me to repose; I die after my own manner, I die exhausted and broken-spirited, as I fall asleep when I have paced three thousand times round my cell,—that is thirty thousand steps, or about ten leagues.”\nNo sooner had this idea taken possession of him than he became more composed, arranged his couch to the best of his power, ate little and slept less, and found existence almost supportable, because he felt that he could throw it off at pleasure, like a worn-out garment. Two methods of self-destruction were at his disposal. He could hang himself with his handkerchief to the window bars, or refuse food and die of starvation. But the first was repugnant to him. Dantès had always entertained the greatest horror of pirates, who are hung up to the yard-arm; he would not die by what seemed an infamous death. He resolved to adopt the second, and began that day to carry out his resolve.\nNearly four years had passed away; at the end of the second he had ceased to mark the lapse of time. Dantès said, “I wish to die,” and had chosen the manner of his death, and fearful of changing his mind, he had taken an oath to die. “When my morning and evening meals are brought,” thought he, “I will cast them out of the window, and they will think that I have eaten them.”",

Nothing but the recollection of his oath gave him strength to proceed. Hunger made viands once repugnant, now acceptable; he held the plate in his hand for an hour at a time, and gazed thoughtfully at the morsel of bad meat, of tainted fish, of black and mouldy bread. It was the last yearning for life contending with the resolution of despair; then his dungeon seemed less sombre, his prospects less desperate. He was still young—he was only four or five-and-twenty—he had nearly fifty years to live. What unforseen events might not open his prison door, and restore him to liberty? Then he raised to his lips the repast that, like a voluntary Tantalus, he refused himself; but he thought of his oath, and he would not break it. He persisted until, at last, he had not sufficient strength to rise and cast his supper out of the loophole. The next morning he could not see or hear; the jailer feared he was dangerously ill. Edmond hoped he was dying.\nThus the day passed away. Edmond felt a sort of stupor creeping over him which brought with it a feeling almost of content; the gnawing pain at his stomach had ceased; his thirst had abated; when he closed his eyes he saw myriads of lights dancing before them like the will-o’-the-wisps that play about the marshes. It was the twilight of that mysterious country called Death!\nSuddenly, about nine o’clock in the evening, Edmond heard a hollow sound in the wall against which he was lying.\nSo many loathsome animals inhabited the prison, that their noise did not, in general, awake him; but whether abstinence had quickened his faculties, or whether the noise was really louder than usual, Edmond raised his head and listened. It was a continual scratching, as if made by a huge claw, a powerful tooth, or some iron instrument attacking the stones.\nAlthough weakened, the young man’s brain instantly responded to the idea that haunts all prisoners—liberty! It seemed to him that heaven had at length taken pity on him, and had sent this noise to warn him on the very brink of the abyss. Perhaps one of those beloved ones he had so often thought of was thinking of him, and striving to diminish the distance that separated them.\nNo, no, doubtless he was deceived, and it was but one of those dreams that forerun death!\nEdmond still heard the sound. It lasted nearly three hours; he then heard a noise of something falling, and all was silent.\nSome hours afterwards it began again, nearer and more distinct. Edmond was intensely interested. Suddenly the jailer entered.\nFor a week since he had resolved to die, and during the four days that he had been carrying out his purpose, Edmond had not spoken to the attendant, had not answered him when he inquired what was the matter with him, and turned his face to the wall when he looked too curiously at him; but now the jailer might hear the noise and put an end to it, and so destroy a ray of something like hope that soothed his last moments.\nThe jailer brought him his breakfast. Dantès raised himself up and began to talk about everything; about the bad quality of the food, about the coldness of his dungeon, grumbling and complaining, in order to have an excuse for speaking louder, and wearying the patience of his jailer, who out of kindness of heart had brought broth and white bread for his prisoner.\nFortunately, he fancied that Dantès was delirious; and placing the food on the rickety table, he withdrew. Edmond listened, and the sound became more and more distinct.\n“There can be no doubt about it,” thought he; “it is some prisoner who is striving to obtain his freedom. Oh, if I were only there to help him!”\nSuddenly another idea took possession of his mind, so used to misfortune, that it was scarcely capable of hope—the idea that the noise was made by workmen the governor had ordered to repair the neighboring dungeon.\nIt was easy to ascertain this; but how could he risk the question? It was easy to call his jailer’s attention to the noise, and watch his countenance as he listened; but might he not by this means destroy hopes far more important than the short-lived satisfaction of his own curiosity? Unfortunately, Edmond’s brain was still so feeble that he could not bend his thoughts to anything in particular. He saw but one means of restoring lucidity and clearness to his judgment. He turned his eyes towards the soup which the jailer had brought, rose, staggered towards it, raised the vessel to his lips, and drank off the contents with a feeling of indescribable pleasure.\nHe had the resolution to stop with this. He had often heard that shipwrecked persons had died through having eagerly devoured too much food. Edmond replaced on the table the bread he was about to devour, and returned to his couch—he did not wish to die. He soon felt that his ideas became again collected—he could think, and strengthen his thoughts by reasoning. Then he said to himself:\n“I must put this to the test, but without compromising anybody. If it is a workman, I need but knock against the wall, and he will cease to work, in order to find out who is knocking, and why he does so; but as his occupation is sanctioned by the governor, he will soon resume it. If, on the contrary, it is a prisoner, the noise I make will alarm him, he will cease, and not begin again until he thinks everyone is asleep.”\nEdmond rose again, but this time his legs did not tremble, and his sight was clear; he went to a corner of his dungeon, detached a stone, and with it knocked against the wall where the sound came. He struck thrice.",

          "text_segment": "At the first blow the sound ceased, as if by magic.\nEdmond listened intently; an hour passed, two hours passed, and no sound was heard from the wall—all was silent there.\nFull of hope, Edmond swallowed a few mouthfuls of bread and water, and, thanks to the vigor of his constitution, found himself well-nigh recovered.\nThe day passed away in utter silence—night came without recurrence of the noise.\n“It is a prisoner,” said Edmond joyfully. His brain was on fire, and life and energy returned.\nThe night passed in perfect silence. Edmond did not close his eyes.\nIn the morning the jailer brought him fresh provisions—he had already devoured those of the previous day; he ate these listening anxiously for the sound, walking round and round his cell, shaking the iron bars of the loophole, restoring vigor and agility to his limbs by exercise, and so preparing himself for his future destiny. At intervals he listened to learn if the noise had not begun again, and grew impatient at the prudence of the prisoner, who did not guess he had been disturbed by a captive as anxious for liberty as himself.\nThree days passed—seventy-two long tedious hours which he counted off by minutes!\nAt length one evening, as the jailer was visiting him for the last time that night, Dantès, with his ear for the hundredth time at the wall, fancied he heard an almost imperceptible movement among the stones. He moved away, walked up and down his cell to collect his thoughts, and then went back and listened.\nThe matter was no longer doubtful. Something was at work on the other side of the wall; the prisoner had discovered the danger, and had substituted a lever for a chisel.\nEncouraged by this discovery, Edmond determined to assist the indefatigable laborer. He began by moving his bed, and looked around for anything with which he could pierce the wall, penetrate the moist cement, and displace a stone.\nHe saw nothing, he had no knife or sharp instrument, the window grating was of iron, but he had too often assured himself of its solidity. All his furniture consisted of a bed, a chair, a table, a pail, and a jug. The bed had iron clamps, but they were screwed to the wood, and it would have required a screw-driver to take them off. The table and chair had nothing, the pail had once possessed a handle, but that had been removed.\nDantès had but one resource, which was to break the jug, and with one of the sharp fragments attack the wall. He let the jug fall on the floor, and it broke in pieces.\nDantès concealed two or three of the sharpest fragments in his bed, leaving the rest on the floor. The breaking of his jug was too natural an accident to excite suspicion. Edmond had all the night to work in, but in the darkness he could not do much, and he soon felt that he was working against something very hard; he pushed back his bed, and waited for day.\nAll night he heard the subterranean workman, who continued to mine his way. Day came, the jailer entered. Dantès told him that the jug had fallen from his hands while he was drinking, and the jailer went grumblingly to fetch another, without giving himself the trouble to remove the fragments of the broken one. He returned speedily, advised the prisoner to be more careful, and departed.\nDantès heard joyfully the key grate in the lock; he listened until the sound of steps died away, and then, hastily displacing his bed, saw by the faint light that penetrated into his cell, that he had labored uselessly the previous evening in attacking the stone instead of removing the plaster that surrounded it.\nThe damp had rendered it friable, and Dantès was able to break it off—in small morsels, it is true, but at the end of half an hour he had scraped off a handful; a mathematician might have calculated that in two years, supposing that the rock was not encountered, a passage twenty feet long and two feet broad, might be formed.\nThe prisoner reproached himself with not having thus employed the hours he had passed in vain hopes, prayer, and despondency. During the six years that he had been imprisoned, what might he not have accomplished?\nThis idea imparted new energy, and in three days he had succeeded, with the utmost precaution, in removing the cement, and exposing the stone-work. The wall was built of rough stones, among which, to give strength to the structure, blocks of hewn stone were at intervals imbedded. It was one of these he had uncovered, and which he must remove from its socket.\nDantès strove to do this with his nails, but they were too weak. The fragments of the jug broke, and after an hour of useless toil, Dantès paused with anguish on his brow.\nWas he to be thus stopped at the beginning, and was he to wait inactive until his fellow workman had completed his task? Suddenly an idea occurred to him—he smiled, and the perspiration dried on his forehead.\nThe jailer always brought Dantès’ soup in an iron saucepan; this saucepan contained soup for both prisoners, for Dantès had noticed that it was either quite full, or half empty, according as the turnkey gave it to him or to his companion first.\nThe handle of this saucepan was of iron; Dantès would have given ten years of his life in exchange for it.\nThe jailer was accustomed to pour the contents of the saucepan into Dantès’ plate, and Dantès, after eating his soup with a wooden spoon, washed the plate, which thus served for every day. Now when evening came Dantès put his plate on the ground near the door; the jailer, as he entered, stepped on it and broke it.\nThis time he could not blame Dantès. He was wrong to leave it there, but the jailer was wrong not to have looked before him. The jailer, therefore, only grumbled. Then he looked about for something to pour the soup into; Dantès’ entire dinner service consisted of one plate—there was no alternative.\n“Leave the saucepan,” said Dantès; “you can take it away when you bring me my breakfast.”\nThis advice was to the jailer’s taste, as it spared him the necessity of making another trip. He left the saucepan.\nDantès was beside himself with joy. He rapidly devoured his food, and after waiting an hour, lest the jailer should change his mind and return, he removed his bed, took the handle of the saucepan, inserted the point between the hewn stone and rough stones of the wall, and employed it as a lever. A slight oscillation showed Dantès that all went well. At the end of an hour the stone was extricated from the wall, leaving a cavity a foot and a half in diameter.\nDantès carefully collected the plaster, carried it into the corner of his cell, and covered it with earth. Then, wishing to make the best use of his time while he had the means of labor, he continued to work without ceasing. At the dawn of day he replaced the stone, pushed his bed against the wall, and lay down. The breakfast consisted of a piece of bread; the jailer entered and placed the bread on the table.\n“Well, don’t you intend to bring me another plate?” said Dantès.\n“No,” replied the turnkey; “you destroy everything. First you break your jug, then you make me break your plate; if all the prisoners followed your example, the government would be ruined. I shall leave you the saucepan, and pour your soup into that. So for the future I hope you will not be so destructive.”\nDantès raised his eyes to heaven and clasped his hands beneath the coverlet. He felt more gratitude for the possession of this piece of iron than he had ever felt for anything. He had noticed, however, that the prisoner on the other side had ceased to labor; no matter, this was a greater reason for proceeding—if his neighbor would not come to him, he would go to his neighbor. All day he toiled on untiringly, and by the evening he had succeeded in extracting ten handfuls of plaster and fragments of stone. When the hour for his jailer’s visit arrived, Dantès straightened the handle of the saucepan as well as he could, and placed it in its accustomed place. The turnkey poured his ration of soup into it, together with the fish—for thrice a week the prisoners were deprived of meat. This would have been a method of reckoning time, had not Dantès long ceased to do so. Having poured out the soup, the turnkey retired.\nDantès wished to ascertain whether his neighbor had really ceased to work. He listened—all was silent, as it had been for the last three days. Dantès sighed; it was evident that his neighbor distrusted him. However, he toiled on all the night without being discouraged; but after two or three hours he encountered an obstacle. The iron made no impression, but met with a smooth surface; Dantès touched it, and found that it was a beam. This beam crossed, or rather blocked up, the hole Dantès had made; it was necessary, therefore, to dig above or under it. The unhappy young man had not thought of this.\n“Oh, my God, my God!” murmured he, “I have so earnestly prayed to you, that I hoped my prayers had been heard. After having deprived me of my liberty, after having deprived me of death, after having recalled me to existence, my God, have pity on me, and do not let me die in despair!”\n“Who talks of God and despair at the same time?” said a voice that seemed to come from beneath the earth, and, deadened by the distance, sounded hollow and sepulchral in the young man’s ears. Edmond’s hair stood on end, and he rose to his knees.",

He heard nothing more. Hours passed in this profound silence, and when the jailer made his evening rounds, Dantès had not stirred from his post. It was only then that he broke his fast, eating a piece of the hard bread and drinking a mouthful of water. The meager meal, however, seemed to restore not only his physical strength but his very soul; hope, which had so long been a stranger, returned to him. He was not alone. It was a prisoner, undoubtedly, a fellow unfortunate working towards freedom.\n\nFor three days, he waited with an impatience that bordered on madness, but the sound did not resume. Then, one evening, as he was about to lose all hope once more, he perceived an almost inaudible movement on the other side of the wall. The workman had not abandoned his task; he had merely changed his tool. Dantès understood at once: his neighbor had encountered an obstacle and was now using a lever.\n\nInspired by this realization, Dantès resolved to aid the effort from his side. He needed a tool. Looking around his cell, his eyes fell upon the water jug. Letting it fall as if by accident, he shattered it on the stone floor, carefully concealing two or three of the sharpest fragments in his bedding. When the jailer brought a replacement, Dantès began his own Herculean task. He set to work on the wall, scraping away the plaster with a shard of pottery, his heart aching with regret for the years he had wasted in idle despair.\n\nSoon, his fingers touched the rough surface of hewn stone. But here his progress halted. The stone was large, firmly set in the surrounding masonry, and his weak fingernails and fragile fragments were useless against it. He needed a lever of his own. An idea, born of desperation and cunning, sparked in his mind. The next day, he complained that his plate was broken, and when the jailer brought his soup in an iron saucepan, Dantès let the plate slip and shatter.\n\n\"There,\" grumbled the jailer, \"you break everything. I'm not bringing you another plate. You can just eat out of the saucepan from now on.\" He left, leaving the saucepan behind.\n\nDantès could have wept with gratitude. The handle of that simple saucepan was the key to his salvation. With painstaking effort, he worked the iron handle into the mortar around the stone. He strained, his muscles screaming in protest, until at last, with a low grinding sound, the stone loosened. He drew it out and carefully hid the stone and the debris beneath his straw pallet.\n\nThe jailer, on his next visit, merely grumbled about the mess but seemed satisfied to leave the saucepan as a permanent fixture, a decision that filled Dantès with an almost religious thankfulness. But a new anxiety seized him: the other prisoner had ceased his work entirely. Had he given up? Dantès decided he could not wait. If his neighbor would not come to him, he would go to his neighbor. He continued his excavation, only to be met with a new, unyielding obstacle—a massive wooden beam that ran directly through his path.\n\nIt was too much. After so much hope, so much ingenuity, to be thwarted by a piece of wood he could never break nor move. The renewed hope shattered, and a despair blacker than any he had ever known washed over him. He threw himself upon his bed, his face buried in his hands.\n\n\"Oh, my God, my God!\" he cried out, his voice choked with anguish. \"After having sustained me, after having given me the courage to begin this work, you abandon me now? Why do you make me suffer so?\"\n\nHe had scarcely uttered the words when a voice, seeming to rise from the very depths of the earth, answered him. It was a hollow, sepulchral sound that froze the blood in his veins.\n\n\"Who is it that speaks of God and despair in the same breath?\"\n\nDantès sprang to his feet, his hair on end, his eyes wide with a terror that was mingled with an indescribable awe.

Was the sound merely a delusion of his overwrought senses, a phantom born of solitude and despair? No, it had been too real, too persistent.

Who are you?”\n“Who are you?” said the voice.\n“An unhappy prisoner,” replied Dantès, who made no hesitation in answering.\n“Of what country?”\n“A Frenchman.”\n“Your name?”\n“Edmond Dantès.”\n“Your profession?”\n“A sailor.”\n“How long have you been here?”\n“Since the 28th of February, 1815.”\n“Your crime?”\n“I am innocent.”\n“But of what are you accused?”\n“Of having conspired to aid the emperor’s return.”\n“What! For the emperor’s return?—the emperor is no longer on the throne, then?”\n“He abdicated at Fontainebleau in 1814, and was sent to the Island of Elba. But how long have you been here that you are ignorant of all this?”\n“Since 1811.”\nDantès shuddered; this man had been four years longer than himself in prison.\n“Do not dig any more,” said the voice; “only tell me how high up is your excavation?”\n“On a level with the floor.”\n“How is it concealed?”\n“Behind my bed.”\n“Has your bed been moved since you have been a prisoner?”\n“No.”\n“What does your chamber open on?”\n“A corridor.”\n“And the corridor?”\n“On a court.”\n“Alas!” murmured the voice.\n“Oh, what is the matter?” cried Dantès.\n“I have made a mistake owing to an error in my plans. I took the wrong angle, and have come out fifteen feet from where I intended. I took the wall you are mining for the outer wall of the fortress.”\n“But then you would be close to the sea?”\n“That is what I hoped.”\n“And supposing you had succeeded?”\n“I should have thrown myself into the sea, gained one of the islands near here—the Isle de Daume or the Isle de Tiboulen—and then I should have been safe.”\n“Could you have swum so far?”\n“Heaven would have given me strength; but now all is lost.”\n“All?”\n“Yes; stop up your excavation carefully, do not work any more, and wait until you hear from me.”\n“Tell me, at least, who you are?”\n“I am—I am No. 27.”\n“You mistrust me, then,” said Dantès. Edmond fancied he heard a bitter laugh resounding from the depths.\n“Oh, I am a Christian,” cried Dantès, guessing instinctively that this man meant to abandon him. “I swear to you by him who died for us that naught shall induce me to breathe one syllable to my jailers; but I conjure you do not abandon me. If you do, I swear to you, for I have got to the end of my strength, that I will dash my brains out against the wall, and you will have my death to reproach yourself with.”\n“How old are you? Your voice is that of a young man.”\n“I do not know my age, for I have not counted the years I have been here. All I do know is, that I was just nineteen when I was arrested, the 28th of February, 1815.”\n“Not quite twenty-six!” murmured the voice; “at that age he cannot be a traitor.”\n“Oh, no, no,” cried Dantès. “I swear to you again, rather than betray you, I would allow myself to be hacked in pieces!”\n“You have done well to speak to me, and ask for my assistance, for I was about to form another plan, and leave you; but your age reassures me. I will not forget you. Wait.”\n“How long?”\n“I must calculate our chances; I will give you the signal.”\n“But you will not leave me; you will come to me, or you will let me come to you. We will escape, and if we cannot escape we will talk; you of those whom you love, and I of those whom I love. You must love somebody?”\n“No, I am alone in the world.”\n“Then you will love me. If you are young, I will be your comrade; if you are old, I will be your son. I have a father who is seventy if he yet lives; I only love him and a young girl called Mercédès. My father has not yet forgotten me, I am sure, but God alone knows if she loves me still; I shall love you as I loved my father.”\n“It is well,” returned the voice; “tomorrow.”\nThese few words were uttered with an accent that left no doubt of his sincerity; Dantès rose, dispersed the fragments with the same precaution as before, and pushed his bed back against the wall. He then gave himself up to his happiness. He would no longer be alone. He was, perhaps, about to regain his liberty; at the worst, he would have a companion, and captivity that is shared is but half captivity. Plaints made in common are almost prayers, and prayers where two or three are gathered together invoke the mercy of heaven.\nAll day Dantès walked up and down his cell. He sat down occasionally on his bed, pressing his hand on his heart. At the slightest noise he bounded towards the door. Once or twice the thought crossed his mind that he might be separated from this unknown, whom he loved already; and then his mind was made up—when the jailer moved his bed and stooped to examine the opening, he would kill him with his water jug. He would be condemned to die, but he was about to die of grief and despair when this miraculous noise recalled him to life.\nThe jailer came in the evening. Dantès was on his bed. It seemed to him that thus he better guarded the unfinished opening. Doubtless there was a strange expression in his eyes, for the jailer said, “Come, are you going mad again?”\nDantès did not answer; he feared that the emotion of his voice would betray him. The jailer went away shaking his head. Night came; Dantès hoped that his neighbor would profit by the silence to address him, but he was mistaken. The next morning, however, just as he removed his bed from the wall, he heard three knocks; he threw himself on his knees.\n“Is it you?” said he; “I am here.”\n“Is your jailer gone?”\n“Yes,” said Dantès; “he will not return until the evening; so that we have twelve hours before us.”\n“I can work, then?” said the voice.\n“Oh, yes, yes; this instant, I entreat you.”\nIn a moment that part of the floor on which Dantès was resting his two hands, as he knelt with his head in the opening, suddenly gave way; he drew back smartly, while a mass of stones and earth disappeared in a hole that opened beneath the aperture he himself had formed. Then from the bottom of this passage, the depth of which it was impossible to measure, he saw appear, first the head, then the shoulders, and lastly the body of a man, who sprang lightly into his cell.",

The words, the first he had heard in years that were not the gruff commands of his jailer, struck him with a force that was both terrifying and exhilarating. He crawled to the wall from which the sound had seemed to emanate.\n\n“Who are you?” he cried. “In the name of Heaven, speak again!”\n\n“I am an unhappy prisoner,” the voice replied, its tone weary but clear. “Who are you?”\n\n“Edmond Dantès. A French sailor, imprisoned since February 1815, accused of being a Bonapartist agent.”\n\nA pause. “And I,” the voice returned, “have been in this fortress since 1811.”\n\nDantès gasped. 1811! This man had been captive four years longer than he had; he was unaware that Napoleon had even returned from Elba, let alone been defeated at Waterloo. The depth of this man’s isolation was even greater than his own.\n\n“But how did you reach me?” Dantès asked.\n\n“A miscalculation,” the voice sighed. “A fatal one. For three years I have been digging, believing my tunnel would lead me to the outer battlements and the sea. Instead, my measurements were off. I have arrived only at your cell.”\n\n“Then seal the opening and wait,” the voice commanded. “I must recalculate.”\n\nA cold terror seized Dantès. To be abandoned now, after this flicker of hope! “No!” he shrieked, pressing his body against the cold stone. “Do not leave me! I have been alone for so long, I have nearly forgotten how to speak! If you forsake me now, I swear I will use my stool to dash my brains out against this very wall, and my death will be on your soul!”\n\nThere was a long silence. Then, the voice, softer now, asked, “How old are you?”\n\n“Not yet twenty-six.”\n\n“So young,” the voice murmured. “So full of fire. Very well. I will not abandon you. Be patient. I will devise a new plan. Listen for my signal. Tomorrow.”\n\n“Tomorrow!” The word was a promise of paradise. Dantès was overwhelmed with joy, a feeling so foreign it was painful. He was no longer alone! He had a companion, a friend, perhaps a savior. He spent the rest of the day in a state of ecstatic delirium, resolving with a cold fury that if the jailer made any attempt to move him, he would kill the man before being separated from his new acquaintance.\n\nThe next morning, after the jailer had made his rounds, Dantès waited, his heart pounding. He heard three distinct knocks against the wall. He replied with his own. The sound of scraping and digging resumed, closer now, more urgent. Suddenly, the flagstones in the corner of his cell shifted. Plaster and dust rained down, and the floor gave way.

The words, the first he had heard in years that were not the gruff commands of his jailer, struck him with a force that was both terrifying and exhilarating. He crawled to the wall from which the sound had seemed to emanate.\n\n“Who are you?” he cried. “In the name of Heaven, speak again!”\n\n“I am an unhappy prisoner,” the voice replied, its tone weary but clear. “Who are you?”\n\n“Edmond Dantès. A French sailor, imprisoned since February 1815, accused of being a Bonapartist agent.”\n\nA pause. “And I,” the voice returned, “have been in this fortress since 1811.”\n\nDantès gasped. 1811!

He dragged his stool to the wall whence the sound came, and listened.\n\n“In the name of Heaven,” he cried, “speak again!”\n\n“Who are you?” said the voice.\n\n“An unhappy prisoner,” replied Dantès. “And you?”\n\n“An unhappy prisoner also.”\n\n“What is your name?”\n\n“They call me Number 27.”\n\n“And your name?”\n\n“Edmond Dantès.”\n\n“Your profession?”\n\n“A sailor.”\n\n“How long have you been here?”\n\n“Since the 28th of February, 1815.”\n\n“Your crime?”\n\n“I am accused of having conspired for the Emperor’s return.”\n\n“What! For the Emperor’s return? Is the Emperor, then, no longer on the throne?”\n\n“He abdicated at Fontainebleau in 1814, and was sent to the Island of Elba.”\n\n“And you have been here since 1815?” the voice asked after a moment of silence.\n\n“Yes.”\n\n“Then you cannot know what has happened in the world.”\n\n“Not at all. But you? How long have you been here?”\n\n“Since 1811.”\n\nDantès uttered a cry of astonishment. Four years before him! This man’s captivity made his own seem trivial.\n\n“Do not dig any more,” said the voice. “Only tell me, whereabouts is your excavation?”\n\n“On a level with the floor.”\n\n“How is it concealed?”\n\n“Behind my bed.”\n\n“Has your bed been moved since you have been here?”\n\n“No.”\n\n“What does your chamber open on?”\n\n“A corridor.”\n\n“And the corridor?”\n\n“On a court.”\n\n“Alas!” murmured the voice. “I am deceived. A fatal miscalculation. My plan was to pierce through the outer wall of the fortress and throw myself into the sea.”\n\n“And you have failed?”\n\n“I have come out in your cell. I took the wrong angle.” The voice was filled with a profound melancholy. “Now, I must ask you to do something for me.”\n\n“What is that?”\n\n“To block up your side of the opening carefully, and to wait until you hear from me again.”\n\n“Oh, sir, sir,” cried Dantès, “do not forsake me! Do not leave me to myself! I swear to you, I would rather you pierced my heart than my wall. If you abandon me, I will dash my brains out against the stones, and you will have my death to answer for.”\n\n“How old are you?” asked the voice. “Your voice seems that of a young man.”\n\n“I do not know my own age, for I have not counted the years. But I was nineteen when I was arrested. I am not yet twenty-six.”\n\n“So young,” the voice sighed. “Do not fear. I will not forsake you. We will wait for a more favorable time. I will think of you, and we will escape together.”\n\n“You promise?”\n\n“I swear it. Now, farewell till I signal you.”\n\n“When?”\n\n“Tomorrow.”\n\nDantès felt he could have heard no more. This promise, this word, was the sum of all human happiness. He threw himself upon his bed, his heart beating with an ecstasy that was almost agony. He was no longer alone. He was going to live again, in the presence of another man. Should the jailer attempt to move him to another cell, he resolved he would kill him with his stool.\n\nThe next day, when the jailer came, Dantès watched his every move, but the man departed without suspicion. Left alone, Dantès rose and listened. Soon he heard three knocks at equal intervals. He fell on his knees.\n\n“Is it you?” he said. “I am here.”\n\n“Is your jailer gone?” asked the voice.\n\n“Yes,” said Dantès; “he will not return until this evening. We have twelve hours of liberty.”\n\n“I can work, then,” said the voice.\n\nA moment later, the sound of diligent labor echoed from below. Suddenly, the floor of Dantès’ cell began to give way. A mass of stones and earth crumbled into the corridor below, and from the bottom of the hole, the head, shoulders, and then the entire body of a man appeared. He climbed nimbly into the cell.",

MAJOR STRUCTURAL ISSUES:\n- The completion omits a significant portion of the dialogue between the two prisoners, especially the detailed exchange of questions and answers about identity, background, and circumstances.

I expected, as I told you, to reach the outer wall, pierce through it, and throw myself into the sea; I have, however, kept along the corridor on which your chamber opens, instead of going beneath it. My labor is all in vain, for I find that the corridor looks into a courtyard filled with soldiers.”\n“That’s true,” said Dantès; “but the corridor you speak of only bounds one side of my cell; there are three others—do you know anything of their situation?”\n“This one is built against the solid rock, and it would take ten experienced miners, duly furnished with the requisite tools, as many years to perforate it.

The fourth and last side of your cell faces on—faces on—stop a minute, now where does it face?”\nThe wall of which he spoke was the one in which was fixed the loophole by which light was admitted to the chamber. This loophole, which gradually diminished in size as it approached the outside, to an opening through which a child could not have passed, was, for better security, furnished with three iron bars, so as to quiet all apprehensions even in the mind of the most suspicious jailer as to the possibility of a prisoner’s escape. As the stranger asked the question, he dragged the table beneath the window.\n“Climb up,” said he to Dantès.\nThe young man obeyed, mounted on the table, and, divining the wishes of his companion, placed his back securely against the wall and held out both hands. The stranger, whom as yet Dantès knew only by the number of his cell, sprang up with an agility by no means to be expected in a person of his years, and, light and steady on his feet as a cat or a lizard, climbed from the table to the outstretched hands of Dantès, and from them to his shoulders; then, bending double, for the ceiling of the dungeon prevented him from holding himself erect, he managed to slip his head between the upper bars of the window, so as to be able to command a perfect view from top to bottom.\nAn instant afterwards he hastily drew back his head, saying, “I thought so!” and sliding from the shoulders of Dantès as dextrously as he had ascended, he nimbly leaped from the table to the ground.",

In the year 1811 I was transferred to Piedmont in France. It was at this period I learned that the destiny which seemed subservient to every wish formed by Napoleon, had bestowed on him a son, named king of Rome even in his cradle. I was very far then from expecting the change you have just informed me of; namely, that four years afterwards, this colossus of power would be overthrown. Then who reigns in France at this moment—Napoleon II.?”\n“No, Louis XVIII.”\n“The brother of Louis XVI.!

Would it not be expecting too much to hope to succeed at your first attempt? Why not try to find an opening in another direction from that which has so unfortunately failed?”\n“Alas, it shows how little notion you can have of all it has cost me to effect a purpose so unexpectedly frustrated, that you talk of beginning over again. In the first place, I was four years making the tools I possess, and have been two years scraping and digging out earth, hard as granite itself; then what toil and fatigue has it not been to remove huge stones I should once have deemed impossible to loosen. Whole days have I passed in these Titanic efforts, considering my labor well repaid if, by night-time I had contrived to carry away a square inch of this hard-bound cement, changed by ages into a substance unyielding as the stones themselves; then to conceal the mass of earth and rubbish I dug up, I was compelled to break through a staircase, and throw the fruits of my labor into the hollow part of it; but the well is now so completely choked up, that I scarcely think it would be possible to add another handful of dust without leading to discovery. Consider also that I fully believed I had accomplished the end and aim of my undertaking, for which I had so exactly husbanded my strength as to make it just hold out to the termination of my enterprise; and now, at the moment when I reckoned upon success, my hopes are forever dashed from me. No, I repeat again, that nothing shall induce me to renew attempts evidently at variance with the Almighty’s pleasure.”\nDantès held down his head, that the other might not see how joy at the thought of having a companion outweighed the sympathy he felt for the failure of the abbé’s plans.\nThe abbé sank upon Edmond’s bed, while Edmond himself remained standing. Escape had never once occurred to him. There are, indeed, some things which appear so impossible that the mind does not dwell on them for an instant. To undermine the ground for fifty feet—to devote three years to a labor which, if successful, would conduct you to a precipice overhanging the sea—to plunge into the waves from the height of fifty, sixty, perhaps a hundred feet, at the risk of being dashed to pieces against the rocks, should you have been fortunate enough to have escaped the fire of the sentinels; and even, supposing all these perils past, then to have to swim for your life a distance of at least three miles ere you could reach the shore—were difficulties so startling and formidable that Dantès had never even dreamed of such a scheme, resigning himself rather to death.\nBut the sight of an old man clinging to life with so desperate a courage, gave a fresh turn to his ideas, and inspired him with new courage. Another, older and less strong than he, had attempted what he had not had sufficient resolution to undertake, and had failed only because of an error in calculation. This same person, with almost incredible patience and perseverance, had contrived to provide himself with tools requisite for so unparalleled an attempt. Another had done all this; why, then, was it impossible to Dantès? Faria had dug his way through fifty feet, Dantès would dig a hundred; Faria, at the age of fifty, had devoted three years to the task; he, who was but half as old, would sacrifice six; Faria, a priest and savant, had not shrunk from the idea of risking his life by trying to swim a distance of three miles to one of the islands—Daume, Rattonneau, or Lemaire; should a hardy sailor, an experienced diver, like himself, shrink from a similar task; should he, who had so often for mere amusement’s sake plunged to the bottom of the sea to fetch up the bright coral branch, hesitate to entertain the same project? He could do it in an hour, and how many times had he, for pure pastime, continued in the water for more than twice as long! At once Dantès resolved to follow the brave example of his energetic companion, and to remember that what has once been done may be done again.",

We must pierce through the corridor by forming a side opening about the middle, as it were the top part of a cross.

All we require to insure success is courage, and that you possess, and strength, which I am not deficient in; as for patience, you have abundantly proved yours—you shall now see me prove mine.”\n“One instant, my dear friend,” replied the abbé; “it is clear you do not understand the nature of the courage with which I am endowed, and what use I intend making of my strength. As for patience, I consider that I have abundantly exercised that in beginning every morning the task of the night before, and every night renewing the task of the day. But then, young man (and I pray of you to give me your full attention), then I thought I could not be doing anything displeasing to the Almighty in trying to set an innocent being at liberty—one who had committed no offence, and merited not condemnation.”\n“And have your notions changed?” asked Dantès with much surprise; “do you think yourself more guilty in making the attempt since you have encountered me?”\n“No; neither do I wish to incur guilt. Hitherto I have fancied myself merely waging war against circumstances, not men. I have thought it no sin to bore through a wall, or destroy a staircase; but I cannot so easily persuade myself to pierce a heart or take away a life.”\nA slight movement of surprise escaped Dantès.\n“Is it possible,” said he, “that where your liberty is at stake you can allow any such scruple to deter you from obtaining it?”\n“Tell me,” replied Faria, “what has hindered you from knocking down your jailer with a piece of wood torn from your bedstead, dressing yourself in his clothes, and endeavoring to escape?”\n“Simply the fact that the idea never occurred to me,” answered Dantès.\n“Because,” said the old man, “the natural repugnance to the commission of such a crime prevented you from thinking of it; and so it ever is because in simple and allowable things our natural instincts keep us from deviating from the strict line of duty. The tiger, whose nature teaches him to delight in shedding blood, needs but the sense of smell to show him when his prey is within his reach, and by following this instinct he is enabled to measure the leap necessary to permit him to spring on his victim; but man, on the contrary, loathes the idea of blood—it is not alone that the laws of social life inspire him with a shrinking dread of taking life; his natural construction and physiological formation——”\nDantès was confused and silent at this explanation of the thoughts which had unconsciously been working in his mind, or rather soul; for there are two distinct sorts of ideas, those that proceed from the head and those that emanate from the heart.",

          "text_segment": "“Since my imprisonment,” said Faria, “I have thought over all the most celebrated cases of escape on record. They have rarely been successful. Those that have been crowned with full success have been long meditated upon, and carefully arranged; such, for instance, as the escape of the Duc de Beaufort from the Château de Vincennes, that of the Abbé Dubuquoi from For l’Evêque; of Latude from the Bastille. Then there are those for which chance sometimes affords opportunity, and those are the best of all. Let us, therefore, wait patiently for some favorable moment, and when it presents itself, profit by it.”\n“Ah,” said Dantès, “you might well endure the tedious delay; you were constantly employed in the task you set yourself, and when weary with toil, you had your hopes to refresh and encourage you.”\n“I assure you,” replied the old man, “I did not turn to that source for recreation or support.”\n“What did you do then?”\n“I wrote or studied.”\n“Were you then permitted the use of pens, ink, and paper?”\n“Oh, no,” answered the abbé; “I had none but what I made for myself.”\n“You made paper, pens and ink?”\n“Yes.”\nDantès gazed with admiration, but he had some difficulty in believing. Faria saw this.\n“When you pay me a visit in my cell, my young friend,” said he, “I will show you an entire work, the fruits of the thoughts and reflections of my whole life; many of them meditated over in the shades of the Colosseum at Rome, at the foot of St. Mark’s column at Venice, and on the borders of the Arno at Florence, little imagining at the time that they would be arranged in order within the walls of the Château d’If. The work I speak of is called A Treatise on the Possibility of a General Monarchy in Italy, and will make one large quarto volume.”\n“And on what have you written all this?”\n“On two of my shirts. I invented a preparation that makes linen as smooth and as easy to write on as parchment.”\n“You are, then, a chemist?”\n“Somewhat; I know Lavoisier, and was the intimate friend of Cabanis.”\n“But for such a work you must have needed books—had you any?”\n“I had nearly five thousand volumes in my library at Rome; but after reading them over many times, I found out that with one hundred and fifty well-chosen books a man possesses, if not a complete summary of all human knowledge, at least all that a man need really know. I devoted three years of my life to reading and studying these one hundred and fifty volumes, till I knew them nearly by heart; so that since I have been in prison, a very slight effort of memory has enabled me to recall their contents as readily as though the pages were open before me. I could recite you the whole of Thucydides, Xenophon, Plutarch, Titus Livius, Tacitus, Strada, Jornandes, Dante, Montaigne, Shakespeare, Spinoza, Machiavelli, and Bossuet. I name only the most important.”\n“You are, doubtless, acquainted with a variety of languages, so as to have been able to read all these?”\n“Yes, I speak five of the modern tongues—that is to say, German, French, Italian, English, and Spanish; by the aid of ancient Greek I learned modern Greek—I don’t speak it so well as I could wish, but I am still trying to improve myself.”\n“Improve yourself!” repeated Dantès; “why, how can you manage to do so?”\n“Why, I made a vocabulary of the words I knew; turned, returned, and arranged them, so as to enable me to express my thoughts through their medium. I know nearly one thousand words, which is all that is absolutely necessary, although I believe there are nearly one hundred thousand in the dictionaries. I cannot hope to be very fluent, but I certainly should have no difficulty in explaining my wants and wishes; and that would be quite as much as I should ever require.”\nStronger grew the wonder of Dantès, who almost fancied he had to do with one gifted with supernatural powers; still hoping to find some imperfection which might bring him down to a level with human beings, he added, “Then if you were not furnished with pens, how did you manage to write the work you speak of?”\n“I made myself some excellent ones, which would be universally preferred to all others if once known. You are aware what huge whitings are served to us on maigre days. Well, I selected the cartilages of the heads of these fishes, and you can scarcely imagine the delight with which I welcomed the arrival of each Wednesday, Friday, and Saturday, as affording me the means of increasing my stock of pens; for I will freely confess that my historical labors have been my greatest solace and relief. While retracing the past, I forget the present; and traversing at will the path of history I cease to remember that I am myself a prisoner.”\n“But the ink,” said Dantès; “of what did you make your ink?”\n“There was formerly a fireplace in my dungeon,” replied Faria, “but it was closed up long ere I became an occupant of this prison. Still, it must have been many years in use, for it was thickly covered with a coating of soot; this soot I dissolved in a portion of the wine brought to me every Sunday, and I assure you a better ink cannot be desired. For very important notes, for which closer attention is required, I pricked one of my fingers, and wrote with my own blood.”\n“And when,” asked Dantès, “may I see all this?”\n“Whenever you please,” replied the abbé.\n“Oh, then let it be directly!” exclaimed the young man.\n“Follow me, then,” said the abbé, as he re-entered the subterranean passage, in which he soon disappeared, followed by Dantès.",

          "text_segment": "After having passed with tolerable ease through the subterranean passage, which, however, did not admit of their holding themselves erect, the two friends reached the further end of the corridor, into which the abbé’s cell opened; from that point the passage became much narrower, and barely permitted one to creep through on hands and knees. The floor of the abbé’s cell was paved, and it had been by raising one of the stones in the most obscure corner that Faria had been able to commence the laborious task of which Dantès had witnessed the completion.\nAs he entered the chamber of his friend, Dantès cast around one eager and searching glance in quest of the expected marvels, but nothing more than common met his view.\n“It is well,” said the abbé; “we have some hours before us—it is now just a quarter past twelve o’clock.” Instinctively Dantès turned round to observe by what watch or clock the abbé had been able so accurately to specify the hour.\n“Look at this ray of light which enters by my window,” said the abbé, “and then observe the lines traced on the wall. Well, by means of these lines, which are in accordance with the double motion of the earth, and the ellipse it describes round the sun, I am enabled to ascertain the precise hour with more minuteness than if I possessed a watch; for that might be broken or deranged in its movements, while the sun and earth never vary in their appointed paths.”\nThis last explanation was wholly lost upon Dantès, who had always imagined, from seeing the sun rise from behind the mountains and set in the Mediterranean, that it moved, and not the earth. A double movement of the globe he inhabited, and of which he could feel nothing, appeared to him perfectly impossible. Each word that fell from his companion’s lips seemed fraught with the mysteries of science, as worthy of digging out as the gold and diamonds in the mines of Guzerat and Golconda, which he could just recollect having visited during a voyage made in his earliest youth.\n“Come,” said he to the abbé, “I am anxious to see your treasures.”\nThe abbé smiled, and, proceeding to the disused fireplace, raised, by the help of his chisel, a long stone, which had doubtless been the hearth, beneath which was a cavity of considerable depth, serving as a safe depository of the articles mentioned to Dantès.\n“What do you wish to see first?” asked the abbé.\n“Oh, your great work on the monarchy of Italy!”\nFaria then drew forth from his hiding-place three or four rolls of linen, laid one over the other, like folds of papyrus. These rolls consisted of slips of cloth about four inches wide and eighteen long; they were all carefully numbered and closely covered with writing, so legible that Dantès could easily read it, as well as make out the sense—it being in Italian, a language he, as a Provençal, perfectly understood.\n“There,” said he, “there is the work complete. I wrote the word finis at the end of the sixty-eighth strip about a week ago. I have torn up two of my shirts, and as many handkerchiefs as I was master of, to complete the precious pages. Should I ever get out of prison and find in all Italy a printer courageous enough to publish what I have composed, my literary reputation is forever secured.”\n“I see,” answered Dantès. “Now let me behold the curious pens with which you have written your work.”\n“Look!” said Faria, showing to the young man a slender stick about six inches long, and much resembling the size of the handle of a fine painting-brush, to the end of which was tied, by a piece of thread, one of those cartilages of which the abbé had before spoken to Dantès; it was pointed, and divided at the nib like an ordinary pen. Dantès examined it with intense admiration, then looked around to see the instrument with which it had been shaped so correctly into form.\n“Ah, yes,” said Faria; “the penknife. That’s my masterpiece. I made it, as well as this larger knife, out of an old iron candlestick.” The penknife was sharp and keen as a razor; as for the other knife, it would serve a double purpose, and with it one could cut and thrust.\nDantès examined the various articles shown to him with the same attention that he had bestowed on the curiosities and strange tools exhibited in the shops at Marseilles as the works of the savages in the South Seas from whence they had been brought by the different trading vessels.\n“As for the ink,” said Faria, “I told you how I managed to obtain that—and I only just make it from time to time, as I require it.”\n“One thing still puzzles me,” observed Dantès, “and that is how you managed to do all this by daylight?”\n“I worked at night also,” replied Faria.\n“Night!—why, for Heaven’s sake, are your eyes like cats’, that you can see to work in the dark?”\n“Indeed they are not; but God has supplied man with the intelligence that enables him to overcome the limitations of natural conditions. I furnished myself with a light.”\n“You did? Pray tell me how.”\n“I separated the fat from the meat served to me, melted it, and so made oil—here is my lamp.” So saying, the abbé exhibited a sort of torch very similar to those used in public illuminations.\n“But how do you procure a light?”\n“Oh, here are two flints and a piece of burnt linen.”\n“And matches?”\n“I pretended that I had a disorder of the skin, and asked for a little sulphur, which was readily supplied.”\nDantès laid the different things he had been looking at on the table, and stood with his head drooping on his breast, as though overwhelmed by the perseverance and strength of Faria’s mind.\n“You have not seen all yet,” continued Faria, “for I did not think it wise to trust all my treasures in the same hiding-place. Let us shut this one up.” They put the stone back in its place; the abbé sprinkled a little dust over it to conceal the traces of its having been removed, rubbed his foot well on it to make it assume the same appearance as the other, and then, going towards his bed, he removed it from the spot it stood in. Behind the head of the bed, and concealed by a stone fitting in so closely as to defy all suspicion, was a hollow space, and in this space a ladder of cords between twenty-five and thirty feet in length. Dantès closely and eagerly examined it; he found it firm, solid, and compact enough to bear any weight.\n“Who supplied you with the materials for making this wonderful work?”\n“I tore up several of my shirts, and ripped out the seams in the sheets of my bed, during my three years’ imprisonment at Fenestrelle; and when I was removed to the Château d’If, I managed to bring the ravellings with me, so that I have been able to finish my work here.”\n“And was it not discovered that your sheets were unhemmed?”\n“Oh, no, for when I had taken out the thread I required, I hemmed the edges over again.”\n“With what?”\n“With this needle,” said the abbé, as, opening his ragged vestments, he showed Dantès a long, sharp fish-bone, with a small perforated eye for the thread, a small portion of which still remained in it.\n“I once thought,” continued Faria, “of removing these iron bars, and letting myself down from the window, which, as you see, is somewhat wider than yours, although I should have enlarged it still more preparatory to my flight; however, I discovered that I should merely have dropped into a sort of inner court, and I therefore renounced the project altogether as too full of risk and danger. Nevertheless, I carefully preserved my ladder against one of those unforeseen opportunities of which I spoke just now, and which sudden chance frequently brings about.”\nWhile affecting to be deeply engaged in examining the ladder, the mind of Dantès was, in fact, busily occupied by the idea that a person so intelligent, ingenious, and clear-sighted as the abbé might probably be able to solve the dark mystery of his own misfortunes, where he himself could see nothing.",

The floor of the abbé’s cell was paved, and it was on the flags that Dantès’ friend was obliged to move the stone that concealed the opening. But he had taken the precaution to smear the stone with a sort of mortar, which he had made with ashes, so that, when it was covered with dust, it was impossible to detect the traces of its removal. When he was in his cell, the abbé, for greater security, stopped up the opening with a stone which he had in a corner; then, turning to Dantès: “You must forgive me,” said he, “for receiving you in such a poor place; but your chamber is not much better furnished, and I have to thank God for this little corner of the world where I can breathe in freedom.” Dantès looked round the cell. It was, indeed, not much better than his own; the abbé was a prisoner, and nothing more. “But you spoke of treasures,” said Dantès. “The light of the day is about to enter,” said the abbé; “we shall see more clearly.” In fact, a ray of light, which Dantès had not before observed, was just beginning to dawn. It came from a small grated opening, which was in the angle formed by the ceiling with the wall. “And what do you do with this ray of light?” asked Dantès. “I will show you,” said the abbé. He took from a corner a small piece of wood, and with his knife he sharpened it into the form of a pen. Then he dipped it into a little ink, which he had in a broken cup, and which he always kept in readiness. “I have made a calendar,” said he; “and with this ray of light, which you see, I have regulated my time.” Dantès was astonished. “How have you done that?” said he. “See,” said the abbé. And he showed Dantès a line traced on the wall. “This line,” said he, “marks the course of the sun. By means of this line, which is divided into twelve parts, I can tell the hour of the day.” “That is wonderful,” said Dantès. “But how did you trace the line?” “With a piece of iron which I found in my cell.” “And the twelve divisions?” “With my knife.” “And the sun?” “I have calculated its course. I know the period of its rising and setting. I have observed the shadows which it casts, and I have deduced from them the time of the day.” “Oh, my friend,” cried Dantès, “you are a prodigy of skill and learning.” “Not at all,” said the abbé, with a smile. “I have had time to study, and I have studied. But you spoke of treasures.” “Yes,” said Dantès. “Well,” said the abbé, “I will show you them.” He went to the fireplace, and, removing a stone which was artfully concealed, he showed Dantès a cavity, in which were several articles. “What are these?” asked Dantès. “Here,” said the abbé, “",

It was, indeed, not much better than his own; the abbé was a prisoner, and nothing more. “But you spoke of treasures,” said Dantès. “The light of the day is about to enter,” said the abbé; “we shall see more clearly.” In fact, a ray of light, which Dantès had not before observed, was just beginning to dawn. It came from a small grated opening, which was in the angle formed by the ceiling with the wall. “And what do you do with this ray of light?” asked Dantès. “I will show you,” said the abbé. He took from a corner a small piece of wood, and with his knife he sharpened it into the form of a pen. Then he dipped it into a little ink, which he had in a broken cup, and which he always kept in readiness. “I have made a calendar,” said he; “and with this ray of light, which you see, I have regulated my time.” Dantès was astonished. “How have you done that?” said he. “See,” said the abbé. And he showed Dantès a line traced on the wall. “This line,” said he, “marks the course of the sun. By means of this line, which is divided into twelve parts, I can tell the hour of the day.” “That is wonderful,” said Dantès. “But how did you trace the line?” “With a piece of iron which I found in my cell.” “And the twelve divisions?” “With my knife.” “And the sun?” “I have calculated its course. I know the period of its rising and setting. I have observed the shadows which it casts, and I have deduced from them the time of the day.” “Oh, my friend,” cried Dantès, “you are a prodigy of skill and learning.” “Not at all,” said the abbé, with a smile. “I have had time to study, and I have studied. But you spoke of treasures.” “Yes,” said Dantès. “Well,” said the abbé, “I will show you them.” He went to the fireplace, and, removing a stone which was artfully concealed, he showed Dantès a cavity, in which were several articles. “What are these?” asked Dantès. “Here,” said the abbé, “",

The floor of the abbé’s cell was paved, and it was on the flags that Dantès’ friend was obliged to conceal the traces of his work. He therefore raised the flagstone without difficulty, and Dantès was again in the passage. He had scarcely entered when the abbé replaced the stone. Dantès was in the abbé’s cell. At first sight it was a wretched place. A bed, a chair, a table, and a pail of water—that was all. Dantès looked round, but saw nothing remarkable. “You are welcome to my house,” said the abbé. “It is not magnificent, but it is safe.” Dantès looked at the bed, the chair, the table, and the pail of water. “You have, then, some secret treasures?” said he. “Treasures? Yes.” The abbé went to a corner of the room, took up a stone which was laid there, and, placing it in the middle of the floor, he stood upon it. “What are you doing?” asked Dantès. “Don’t you see that I am enjoying the light of the sun?” said the abbé. “The sun? Do you see the sun?” “Yes,” said the abbé. “I see it as plainly as you see the hand I now hold up to you.” “But where does the light come from?” “From that opening in the roof.” And the abbé pointed to a small hole in the ceiling, through which a faint ray of light penetrated. “For fifteen years,” said the abbé, “I have been watching the passage of that ray of light. I have seen it pass from one side of my cell to the other, and I have marked its course upon the wall. I have divided the year into four seasons, and the day into twelve hours. I know the hour of the day as well as if I had a watch.” “That is wonderful!” said Dantès. “But what treasures have you?” The abbé smiled. “Follow me,” said he. He went to the fireplace, and, removing a stone which concealed the opening of a small cavity, he drew forth three or four rolls of linen, which he unfolded. “What is this?” asked Dantès. “This,” said the abbé, “is my great work, a treatise on the possibility of a general monarchy in Italy.” “Written by you?” “Yes; with this.” And the abbé showed Dantès a small pen, made from the cartilage of a fish’s head. “And with what ink?” “With the soot of my chimney, mixed with a little wine which I get from the governor.” “And on what do you write?” “On my shirts. I have had two, and when they were worn out, I wrote on the pieces.” “But you must have had a light?” “I made one.” “How?” “With the fat of my meat, which I saved. I made a lamp, and with a piece of my shirt I made a wick.” “But you had no fire?” “I got some from the soldiers who brought me my food.” “And a knife?” “I made one with an old iron candlestick.” “And a penknife?” “With the same.” “And paper?” “I had some, but it was soon gone. I then had recourse to my shirts.” “You are a wonderful man,” said Dantès. “But you must have some other treasures?” “Yes; I have one more.” The abbé went to his bed, and, removing it, he showed Dantès a hole in the wall, which he had dug with his knife. From this hole he drew a ladder of rope, about twenty-five feet long. “What is that for?” asked Dantès. “To escape with.” “And have you never tried?” “I have; but I was discovered.” “And what did they do to you?” “They put me in a dungeon for six months.” “And you did not despair?” “I never despair.” Dantès was overwhelmed with astonishment. He looked at the abbé with admiration. “Now,” said the abbé, “you know all my treasures. What do you think of them?” “They are magnificent,” said Dantès. “But what is the use of them now?” “To you, perhaps, they may be of some use. Take them.” “To me? I have no need of them.” “Who knows? One day you may be free.” “And then?” “Then you will be rich.” “And what shall I do with my riches?” “You will do good to your friends, and harm to your enemies.” Dantès’ heart was filled with a new feeling. He had entered the abbé’s cell with the despair of a man who has nothing to hope for in this world. He left it with the hope of a man who has a treasure to look forward to. He had found a friend, a companion, a father. He had found more; he had found a treasure, a science, a hope. He had found what he had so long sought for—a key to the mystery of his life.",

The floor of the abbé’s cell was paved, and it had been by raising one of the stones in the most obscure corner that Faria had been able to commence the laborious task of which Dantès had witnessed the completion. As he entered the chamber of his friend, Dantès cast a rapid glance around. It was, like his own, a dungeon, but it was a living dungeon, in which a human being lived and moved—a dungeon, in short, that was inhabited. A small but massive oaken table, with a stool, a bed, and a pitcher, were the only articles of furniture. Dantès saw nothing extraordinary. “You are welcome, my son,” said the abbé. “You have come to see a prisoner who has not seen a human face for five years.” Dantès looked at the abbé with an air of wonder. “But you have books?” said he. “I have this,” said the abbé, showing him a large manuscript, written on strips of linen. “And what is this?” asked Dantès. “It is the history of the Italian kingdoms,” answered the abbé. “And where did you get the pens and ink?” “I made them myself.” Dantès looked at the abbé with admiration. “But the light?” said he. “There is a window,” said the abbé, pointing to a small opening in the wall, through which a faint light glimmered. “Yes,” said Dantès, “but the sun does not shine into this dungeon.” “I have a means of knowing the time,” said the abbé. “How?” “See this ray of light which enters by my window? Well, by means of this ray, I have calculated the time.” “You have calculated the time?” “Yes. See, on this wall I have traced a meridian line. By the help of this line, which I have divided into twelve parts, I can tell the hour of the day with the utmost precision.” “My dear friend,” said Dantès, “you are a prodigy of genius.” “Not at all,” said the abbé. “But you must have some other treasures?” “Yes, I have.” The abbé went to the fireplace, and, removing a stone, which was artfully concealed, he showed Dantès a cavity, in which were several articles. “What are these?” asked Dantès. “Here,” said the abbé, “is a penknife I made out of an old iron candlestick; here is a pen made from the cartilage of a fish’s head; here is a bottle of ink, which I made from the soot of the chimney, mixed with wine; and here is a manuscript, which contains all my thoughts on the government of Italy.” “But,” said Dantès, “you must have had a light to write by.” “I made a lamp,” said the abbé. “And how?” “With the fat of my meat, which I saved. I made a wick with a piece of my shirt, and I got fire by striking a piece of flint against a piece of steel which I had.” “But where did you get the flint and steel?” “I broke a piece of flint from the wall, and I made a piece of steel out of an old buckle.” “And the tinder?” “I made it with burnt linen.” “And the sulphur?” “I got it from the doctor, under pretence of a skin disease.” Dantès was lost in admiration. “But,” said he, “you have not shown me all your treasures.” “There is one more,” said the abbé. He went to his bed, and, removing it, he showed Dantès a hole in the wall, which he had dug with his knife. From this hole he drew a ladder of rope, about twenty-five feet long. “What is that for?” asked Dantès. “To escape with.” “And have you never tried?” “I have; but I was discovered.” “And what did they do to you?” “They put me in a dungeon for six months.” “And you did not despair?” “I never despair.” Dantès was overwhelmed with astonishment.

          "text_segment": "What are you thinking of?” asked the abbé smilingly, imputing the deep abstraction in which his visitor was plunged to the excess of his awe and wonder.\n“I was reflecting, in the first place,” replied Dantès, “upon the enormous degree of intelligence and ability you must have employed to reach the high perfection to which you have attained. What would you not have accomplished if you had been free?”\n“Possibly nothing at all; the overflow of my brain would probably, in a state of freedom, have evaporated in a thousand follies; misfortune is needed to bring to light the treasures of the human intellect. Compression is needed to explode gunpowder. Captivity has brought my mental faculties to a focus; and you are well aware that from the collision of clouds electricity is produced—from electricity, lightning, from lightning, illumination.”\n“No,” replied Dantès. “I know nothing. Some of your words are to me quite empty of meaning. You must be blessed indeed to possess the knowledge you have.”\nThe abbé smiled. “Well,” said he, “but you had another subject for your thoughts; did you not say so just now?”\n“I did!”\n“You have told me as yet but one of them—let me hear the other.”\n“It was this,—that while you had related to me all the particulars of your past life, you were perfectly unacquainted with mine.”\n“Your life, my young friend, has not been of sufficient length to admit of your having passed through any very important events.”\n“It has been long enough to inflict on me a great and undeserved misfortune. I would fain fix the source of it on man that I may no longer vent reproaches upon Heaven.”\n“Then you profess ignorance of the crime with which you are charged?”\n“I do, indeed; and this I swear by the two beings most dear to me upon earth,—my father and Mercédès.”\n“Come,” said the abbé, closing his hiding-place, and pushing the bed back to its original situation, “let me hear your story.”\nDantès obeyed, and commenced what he called his history, but which consisted only of the account of a voyage to India, and two or three voyages to the Levant, until he arrived at the recital of his last cruise, with the death of Captain Leclere, and the receipt of a packet to be delivered by himself to the grand marshal; his interview with that personage, and his receiving, in place of the packet brought, a letter addressed to a Monsieur Noirtier—his arrival at Marseilles, and interview with his father—his affection for Mercédès, and their nuptual feast—his arrest and subsequent examination, his temporary detention at the Palais de Justice, and his final imprisonment in the Château d’If. From this point everything was a blank to Dantès—he knew nothing more, not even the length of time he had been imprisoned. His recital finished, the abbé reflected long and earnestly.\n“There is,” said he, at the end of his meditations, “a clever maxim, which bears upon what I was saying to you some little while ago, and that is, that unless wicked ideas take root in a naturally depraved mind, human nature, in a right and wholesome state, revolts at crime. Still, from an artificial civilization have originated wants, vices, and false tastes, which occasionally become so powerful as to stifle within us all good feelings, and ultimately to lead us into guilt and wickedness. From this view of things, then, comes the axiom that if you visit to discover the author of any bad action, seek first to discover the person to whom the perpetration of that bad action could be in any way advantageous. Now, to apply it in your case,—to whom could your disappearance have been serviceable?”\n“To no one, by Heaven! I was a very insignificant person.”\n“Do not speak thus, for your reply evinces neither logic nor philosophy; everything is relative, my dear young friend, from the king who stands in the way of his successor, to the employee who keeps his rival out of a place. Now, in the event of the king’s death, his successor inherits a crown,—when the employee dies, the supernumerary steps into his shoes, and receives his salary of twelve thousand livres. Well, these twelve thousand livres are his civil list, and are as essential to him as the twelve millions of a king. Everyone, from the highest to the lowest degree, has his place on the social ladder, and is beset by stormy passions and conflicting interests, as in Descartes’ theory of pressure and impulsion. But these forces increase as we go higher, so that we have a spiral which in defiance of reason rests upon the apex and not on the base. Now let us return to your particular world. You say you were on the point of being made captain of the Pharaon?”\n“Yes.”\n“And about to become the husband of a young and lovely girl?”\n“Yes.”\n“Now, could anyone have had any interest in preventing the accomplishment of these two things? But let us first settle the question as to its being the interest of anyone to hinder you from being captain of the Pharaon. What say you?”\n“I cannot believe such was the case. I was generally liked on board, and had the sailors possessed the right of selecting a captain themselves, I feel convinced their choice would have fallen on me. There was only one person among the crew who had any feeling of ill-will towards me. I had quarelled with him some time previously, and had even challenged him to fight me; but he refused.”\n“Now we are getting on. And what was this man’s name?”\n“Danglars.”\n“What rank did he hold on board?”\n“He was supercargo.”\n“And had you been captain, should you have retained him in his employment?”\n“Not if the choice had remained with me, for I had frequently observed inaccuracies in his accounts.”\n“Good again! Now then, tell me, was any person present during your last conversation with Captain Leclere?”\n“No; we were quite alone.”\n“Could your conversation have been overheard by anyone?”\n“It might, for the cabin door was open—and—stay; now I recollect,—Danglars himself passed by just as Captain Leclere was giving me the packet for the grand marshal.”\n“That’s better,” cried the abbé; “now we are on the right scent. Did you take anybody with you when you put into the port of Elba?”\n“Nobody.”\n“Somebody there received your packet, and gave you a letter in place of it, I think?”\n“Yes; the grand marshal did.”\n“And what did you do with that letter?”\n“Put it into my portfolio.”\n“You had your portfolio with you, then? Now, how could a sailor find room in his pocket for a portfolio large enough to contain an official letter?”\n“You are right; it was left on board.”\n“Then it was not till your return to the ship that you put the letter in the portfolio?”\n“No.”\n“And what did you do with this same letter while returning from Porto-Ferrajo to the vessel?”\n“I carried it in my hand.”\n“So that when you went on board the Pharaon, everybody could see that you held a letter in your hand?”\n“Yes.”\n“Danglars, as well as the rest?”\n“Danglars, as well as others.”\n“Now, listen to me, and try to recall every circumstance attending your arrest. Do you recollect the words in which the information against you was formulated?”\n“Oh yes, I read it over three times, and the words sank deeply into my memory.”\n“Repeat it to me.”\nDantès paused a moment, then said, “This is it, word for word: ‘The king’s attorney is informed by a friend to the throne and religion, that one Edmond Dantès, mate on board the Pharaon, this day arrived from Smyrna, after having touched at Naples and Porto-Ferrajo, has been intrusted by Murat with a packet for the usurper; again, by the usurper, with a letter for the Bonapartist Club in Paris. This proof of his guilt may be procured by his immediate arrest, as the letter will be found either about his person, at his father’s residence, or in his cabin on board the Pharaon.’”\nThe abbé shrugged his shoulders. “The thing is clear as day,” said he; “and you must have had a very confiding nature, as well as a good heart, not to have suspected the origin of the whole affair.”\n“Do you really think so? Ah, that would indeed be infamous.”\n“How did Danglars usually write?”\n“In a handsome, running hand.”\n“And how was the anonymous letter written?”\n“Backhanded.”\nAgain the abbé smiled. “Disguised.”\n“It was very boldly written, if disguised.”\n“Stop a bit,” said the abbé, taking up what he called his pen, and, after dipping it into the ink, he wrote on a piece of prepared linen, with his left hand, the first two or three words of the accusation. Dantès drew back, and gazed on the abbé with a sensation almost amounting to terror.\n“How very astonishing!” cried he at length. “Why your writing exactly resembles that of the accusation.”\n“Simply because that accusation had been written with the left hand; and I have noticed that——”\n“What?”\n“That while the writing of different persons done with the right hand varies, that performed with the left hand is invariably uniform.”\n“You have evidently seen and observed everything.”\n“Let us proceed.”\n“Oh, yes, yes!”\n“Now as regards the second question.”\n“I am listening.”\n“Was there any person whose interest it was to prevent your marriage with Mercédès?”\n“Yes; a young man who loved her.”\n“And his name was——”\n“Fernand.”\n“That is a Spanish name, I think?”\n“He was a Catalan.”\n“You imagine him capable of writing the letter?”\n“Oh, no; he would more likely have got rid of me by sticking a knife into me.”\n“That is in strict accordance with the Spanish character; an assassination they will unhesitatingly commit, but an act of cowardice, never.”\n“Besides,” said Dantès, “the various circumstances mentioned in the letter were wholly unknown to him.”\n“You had never spoken of them yourself to anyone?”\n“To no one.”\n“Not even to your mistress?”\n“No, not even to my betrothed.”\n“Then it is Danglars.”\n“I feel quite sure of it now.”\n“Wait a little. Pray, was Danglars acquainted with Fernand?”\n“No—yes, he was. Now I recollect——”\n“What?”\n“To have seen them both sitting at table together under an arbor at Père Pamphile’s the evening before the day fixed for my wedding. They were in earnest conversation. Danglars was joking in a friendly way, but Fernand looked pale and agitated.”\n“Were they alone?”\n“There was a third person with them whom I knew perfectly well, and who had, in all probability made their acquaintance; he was a tailor named Caderousse, but he was very drunk. Stay!—stay!—How strange that it should not have occurred to me before! Now I remember quite well, that on the table round which they were sitting were pens, ink, and paper. Oh, the heartless, treacherous scoundrels!” exclaimed Dantès, pressing his hand to his throbbing brows.",

Is the world filled with tigers and crocodiles?”\n“Yes; and remember that two-legged tigers and crocodiles are more dangerous than the others.”\n“Never mind; let us go on.”\n“With all my heart! You tell me he burned the letter?”\n“He did; saying at the same time, ‘You see I thus destroy the only proof existing against you.’”\n“This action is somewhat too sublime to be natural.”\n“You think so?”\n“I am sure of it. To whom was this letter addressed?”\n“To M. Noirtier, Rue Coq-Héron, No. 13, Paris.”\n“Now can you conceive of any interest that your heroic deputy could possibly have had in the destruction of that letter?”\n“Why, it is not altogether impossible he might have had, for he made me promise several times never to speak of that letter to anyone, assuring me he so advised me for my own interest; and, more than this, he insisted on my taking a solemn oath never to utter the name mentioned in the address.”\n“Noirtier!” repeated the abbé; “Noirtier!—I knew a person of that name at the court of the Queen of Etruria,—a Noirtier, who had been a Girondin during the Revolution! What was your deputy called?”\n“De Villefort!” The abbé burst into a fit of laughter, while Dantès gazed on him in utter astonishment.\n“What ails you?” said he at length.\n“Do you see that ray of sunlight?”\n“I do.”\n“Well, the whole thing is more clear to me than that sunbeam is to you. Poor fellow! poor young man! And you tell me this magistrate expressed great sympathy and commiseration for you?”\n“He did.”\n“And the worthy man destroyed your compromising letter?”\n“Yes.”\n“And then made you swear never to utter the name of Noirtier?”\n“Yes.”\n“Why, you poor short-sighted simpleton, can you not guess who this Noirtier was, whose very name he was so careful to keep concealed? This Noirtier was his father!”\nHad a thunderbolt fallen at the feet of Dantès, or hell opened its yawning gulf before him, he could not have been more completely transfixed with horror than he was at the sound of these unexpected words. Starting up, he clasped his hands around his head as though to prevent his very brain from bursting, and exclaimed, “His father! his father!”\n“Yes, his father,” replied the abbé; “his right name was Noirtier de Villefort.”\nAt this instant a bright light shot through the mind of Dantès, and cleared up all that had been dark and obscure before. The change that had come over Villefort during the examination, the destruction of the letter, the exacted promise, the almost supplicating tones of the magistrate, who seemed rather to implore mercy than to pronounce punishment,—all returned with a stunning force to his memory. He cried out, and staggered against the wall like a drunken man, then he hurried to the opening that led from the abbé’s cell to his own, and said, “I must be alone, to think over all this.”\nWhen he regained his dungeon, he threw himself on his bed, where the turnkey found him in the evening visit, sitting with fixed gaze and contracted features, dumb and motionless as a statue. During these hours of profound meditation, which to him had seemed only minutes, he had formed a fearful resolution, and bound himself to its fulfilment by a solemn oath.\nDantès was at length roused from his reverie by the voice of Faria, who, having also been visited by his jailer, had come to invite his fellow-sufferer to share his supper. The reputation of being out of his mind, though harmlessly and even amusingly so, had procured for the abbé unusual privileges. He was supplied with bread of a finer, whiter quality than the usual prison fare, and even regaled each Sunday with a small quantity of wine. Now this was a Sunday, and the abbé had come to ask his young companion to share the luxuries with him.\nDantès followed him; his features were no longer contracted, and now wore their usual expression, but there was that in his whole appearance that bespoke one who had come to a fixed and desperate resolve. Faria bent on him his penetrating eye.\n“I regret now,” said he, “having helped you in your late inquiries, or having given you the information I did.”\n“Why so?” inquired Dantès.\n“Because it has instilled a new passion in your heart—that of vengeance.”\nDantès smiled. “Let us talk of something else,” said he.",

          "text_segment": "Again the abbé looked at him, then mournfully shook his head; but in accordance with Dantès’ request, he began to speak of other matters. The elder prisoner was one of those persons whose conversation, like that of all who have experienced many trials, contained many useful and important hints as well as sound information; but it was never egotistical, for the unfortunate man never alluded to his own sorrows. Dantès listened with admiring attention to all he said; some of his remarks corresponded with what he already knew, or applied to the sort of knowledge his nautical life had enabled him to acquire. A part of the good abbé’s words, however, were wholly incomprehensible to him; but, like the aurora which guides the navigator in northern latitudes, opened new vistas to the inquiring mind of the listener, and gave fantastic glimpses of new horizons, enabling him justly to estimate the delight an intellectual mind would have in following one so richly gifted as Faria along the heights of truth, where he was so much at home.\n“You must teach me a small part of what you know,” said Dantès, “if only to prevent your growing weary of me. I can well believe that so learned a person as yourself would prefer absolute solitude to being tormented with the company of one as ignorant and uninformed as myself. If you will only agree to my request, I promise you never to mention another word about escaping.”\nThe abbé smiled.\n“Alas, my boy,” said he, “human knowledge is confined within very narrow limits; and when I have taught you mathematics, physics, history, and the three or four modern languages with which I am acquainted, you will know as much as I do myself. Now, it will scarcely require two years for me to communicate to you the stock of learning I possess.”\n“Two years!” exclaimed Dantès; “do you really believe I can acquire all these things in so short a time?”\n“Not their application, certainly, but their principles you may; to learn is not to know; there are the learners and the learned. Memory makes the one, philosophy the other.”\n“But cannot one learn philosophy?”\n“Philosophy cannot be taught; it is the application of the sciences to truth; it is like the golden cloud in which the Messiah went up into heaven.”\n“Well, then,” said Dantès, “What shall you teach me first? I am in a hurry to begin. I want to learn.”\n“Everything,” said the abbé. And that very evening the prisoners sketched a plan of education, to be entered upon the following day. Dantès possessed a prodigious memory, combined with an astonishing quickness and readiness of conception; the mathematical turn of his mind rendered him apt at all kinds of calculation, while his naturally poetical feelings threw a light and pleasing veil over the dry reality of arithmetical computation, or the rigid severity of geometry. He already knew Italian, and had also picked up a little of the Romaic dialect during voyages to the East; and by the aid of these two languages he easily comprehended the construction of all the others, so that at the end of six months he began to speak Spanish, English, and German.\nIn strict accordance with the promise made to the abbé, Dantès spoke no more of escape. Perhaps the delight his studies afforded him left no room for such thoughts; perhaps the recollection that he had pledged his word (on which his sense of honor was keen) kept him from referring in any way to the possibilities of flight. Days, even months, passed by unheeded in one rapid and instructive course. At the end of a year Dantès was a new man.",

Sometimes he would fall into long reveries, sigh heavily and involuntarily, then suddenly rise, and, with folded arms, begin pacing the confined space of his dungeon. One day he stopped all at once, and exclaimed:\n“Ah, if there were no sentinel!”\n“There shall not be one a minute longer than you please,” said Dantès, who had followed the working of his thoughts as accurately as though his brain were enclosed in crystal so clear as to display its minutest operations.\n“I have already told you,” answered the abbé, “that I loathe the idea of shedding blood.”\n“And yet the murder, if you choose to call it so, would be simply a measure of self-preservation.”\n“No matter! I could never agree to it.”\n“Still, you have thought of it?”\n“Incessantly, alas!” cried the abbé.\n“And you have discovered a means of regaining our freedom, have you not?” asked Dantès eagerly.\n“I have; if it were only possible to place a deaf and blind sentinel in the gallery beyond us.”\n“He shall be both blind and deaf,” replied the young man, with an air of determination that made his companion shudder.\n“No, no,” cried the abbé; “impossible!”\nDantès endeavored to renew the subject; the abbé shook his head in token of disapproval, and refused to make any further response. Three months passed away.\n“Are you strong?” the abbé asked one day of Dantès. The young man, in reply, took up the chisel, bent it into the form of a horseshoe, and then as readily straightened it.\n“And will you engage not to do any harm to the sentry, except as a last resort?”\n“I promise on my honor.”\n“Then,” said the abbé, “we may hope to put our design into execution.”\n“And how long shall we be in accomplishing the necessary work?”\n“At least a year.”\n“And shall we begin at once?”\n“At once.”\n“We have lost a year to no purpose!” cried Dantès.\n“Do you consider the last twelve months to have been wasted?” asked the abbé.\n“Forgive me!” cried Edmond, blushing deeply.\n“Tut, tut!” answered the abbé, “man is but man after all, and you are about the best specimen of the genus I have ever known. Come, let me show you my plan.”\nThe abbé then showed Dantès the sketch he had made for their escape. It consisted of a plan of his own cell and that of Dantès, with the passage which united them. In this passage he proposed to drive a level as they do in mines; this level would bring the two prisoners immediately beneath the gallery where the sentry kept watch; once there, a large excavation would be made, and one of the flag-stones with which the gallery was paved be so completely loosened that at the desired moment it would give way beneath the feet of the soldier, who, stunned by his fall, would be immediately bound and gagged by Dantès before he had power to offer any resistance. The prisoners were then to make their way through one of the gallery windows, and to let themselves down from the outer walls by means of the abbé’s ladder of cords.\nDantès’ eyes sparkled with joy, and he rubbed his hands with delight at the idea of a plan so simple, yet apparently so certain to succeed. That very day the miners began their labors, with a vigor and alacrity proportionate to their long rest from fatigue and their hopes of ultimate success. Nothing interrupted the progress of the work except the necessity that each was under of returning to his cell in anticipation of the turnkey’s visits. They had learned to distinguish the almost imperceptible sound of his footsteps as he descended towards their dungeons, and happily, never failed of being prepared for his coming. The fresh earth excavated during their present work, and which would have entirely blocked up the old passage, was thrown, by degrees and with the utmost precaution, out of the window in either Faria’s or Dantès’ cell, the rubbish being first pulverized so finely that the night wind carried it far away without permitting the smallest trace to remain.\nMore than a year had been consumed in this undertaking, the only tools for which had been a chisel, a knife, and a wooden lever; Faria still continuing to instruct Dantès by conversing with him, sometimes in one language, sometimes in another; at others, relating to him the history of nations and great men who from time to time have risen to fame and trodden the path of glory. The abbé was a man of the world, and had, moreover, mixed in the first society of the day; he wore an air of melancholy dignity which Dantès, thanks to the imitative powers bestowed on him by nature, easily acquired, as well as that outward polish and politeness he had before been wanting in, and which is seldom possessed except by those who have been placed in constant intercourse with persons of high birth and breeding.\nAt the end of fifteen months the level was finished, and the excavation completed beneath the gallery, and the two workmen could distinctly hear the measured tread of the sentinel as he paced to and fro over their heads. Compelled, as they were, to await a night sufficiently dark to favor their flight, they were obliged to defer their final attempt till that auspicious moment should arrive; their greatest dread now was lest the stone through which the sentry was doomed to fall should give way before its right time, and this they had in some measure provided against by propping it up with a small beam which they had discovered in the walls through which they had worked their way. Dantès was occupied in arranging this piece of wood when he heard Faria, who had remained in Edmond’s cell for the purpose of cutting a peg to secure their rope-ladder, call to him in a tone indicative of great suffering.",

One day, he exclaimed, \\\"Ah, if there were no sentinel!\\\"\\n\\n\\\"The sentinel need not be an obstacle,\\\" said Dantès, who had been pondering the same idea. \\\"We can overcome him.\\\"\\n\\n\\\"I have sworn never to shed blood,\\\" replied Faria.\\n\\n\\\"But it would be in self-defense,\\\" Dantès urged.\\n\\n\\\"No matter.

That year was not lost.\\\" He then revealed his plan. They would dig a tunnel from the passage that connected their cells, extending it beneath the gallery where the sentinel paced. There, they would excavate the earth from under a large flagstone until it rested on nothing. When the soldier stepped on it, the stone would give way, and he would fall into their excavation. Stunned, he would be easily bound and gagged by Dantès. They would then climb into the gallery, and using a rope-ladder Faria had ingeniously crafted, escape through a window. Dantès was overjoyed by the simple yet brilliant plan.\\n\\nThey began their immense labor at once. With a chisel, a knife, and a wooden lever, they toiled. The excavated earth was pulverized into dust and, handful by handful, thrown from their cell windows into the sea during the darkest hours of the night. Their work was interrupted only by the jailer's rounds, whose footsteps they learned to distinguish from all others. For fifteen months they worked. During this time, Faria continued his instruction, and Dantès absorbed not only knowledge but the manners and refinement of a gentleman.\\n\\nAt last, the work was done. The tunnel was complete, and the flagstone in the gallery above was supported by just a few precarious bits of earth. They could hear the regular tread of the sentinel pacing above them. All they needed was a dark, stormy night. Their greatest fear was that the stone, loosened from its foundation, might fall prematurely. To prevent this, Dantès was in the act of wedging a small beam of wood to support it, when he heard Faria, who had remained in Edmond's cell, call out in a tone of great suffering, \\\"Dantès!

I am seized with a terrible, perhaps mortal illness; I can feel that the paroxysm is fast approaching. I had a similar attack the year previous to my imprisonment. This malady admits but of one remedy; I will tell you what that is. Go into my cell as quickly as you can; draw out one of the feet that support the bed; you will find it has been hollowed out for the purpose of containing a small phial you will see there half-filled with a red-looking fluid. Bring it to me—or rather—no, no!—I may be found here, therefore help me back to my room while I have the strength to drag myself along. Who knows what may happen, or how long the attack may last?”\nIn spite of the magnitude of the misfortune which thus suddenly frustrated his hopes, Dantès did not lose his presence of mind, but descended into the passage, dragging his unfortunate companion with him; then, half-carrying, half-supporting him, he managed to reach the abbé’s chamber, when he immediately laid the sufferer on his bed.\n“Thanks,” said the poor abbé, shivering as though his veins were filled with ice. “I am about to be seized with a fit of catalepsy; when it comes to its height I shall probably lie still and motionless as though dead, uttering neither sigh nor groan. On the other hand, the symptoms may be much more violent, and cause me to fall into fearful convulsions, foam at the mouth, and cry out loudly. Take care my cries are not heard, for if they are it is more than probable I should be removed to another part of the prison, and we be separated forever. When I become quite motionless, cold, and rigid as a corpse, then, and not before,—be careful about this,—force open my teeth with the knife, pour from eight to ten drops of the liquor contained in the phial down my throat, and I may perhaps revive.”\n“Perhaps!” exclaimed Dantès in grief-stricken tones.\n“Help! help!” cried the abbé, “I—I—die—I——”\nSo sudden and violent was the fit that the unfortunate prisoner was unable to complete the sentence; a violent convulsion shook his whole frame, his eyes started from their sockets, his mouth was drawn on one side, his cheeks became purple, he struggled, foamed, dashed himself about, and uttered the most dreadful cries, which, however, Dantès prevented from being heard by covering his head with the blanket. The fit lasted two hours; then, more helpless than an infant, and colder and paler than marble, more crushed and broken than a reed trampled under foot, he fell back, doubled up in one last convulsion, and became as rigid as a corpse.\nEdmond waited till life seemed extinct in the body of his friend, then, taking up the knife, he with difficulty forced open the closely fixed jaws, carefully administered the appointed number of drops, and anxiously awaited the result. An hour passed away and the old man gave no sign of returning animation. Dantès began to fear he had delayed too long ere he administered the remedy, and, thrusting his hands into his hair, continued gazing on the lifeless features of his friend. At length a slight color tinged the livid cheeks, consciousness returned to the dull, open eyeballs, a faint sigh issued from the lips, and the sufferer made a feeble effort to move.\n“He is saved! he is saved!” cried Dantès in a paroxysm of delight.\nThe sick man was not yet able to speak, but he pointed with evident anxiety towards the door. Dantès listened, and plainly distinguished the approaching steps of the jailer. It was therefore near seven o’clock; but Edmond’s anxiety had put all thoughts of time out of his head.\nThe young man sprang to the entrance, darted through it, carefully drawing the stone over the opening, and hurried to his cell. He had scarcely done so before the door opened, and the jailer saw the prisoner seated as usual on the side of his bed. Almost before the key had turned in the lock, and before the departing steps of the jailer had died away in the long corridor he had to traverse, Dantès, whose restless anxiety concerning his friend left him no desire to touch the food brought him, hurried back to the abbé’s chamber, and raising the stone by pressing his head against it, was soon beside the sick man’s couch. Faria had now fully regained his consciousness, but he still lay helpless and exhausted on his miserable bed.",

The attack which has just passed away, condemns me forever to the walls of a prison. None can fly from a dungeon who cannot walk.”\n“Well, we will wait,—a week, a month, two months, if need be,—and meanwhile your strength will return. Everything is in readiness for our flight, and we can select any time we choose. As soon as you feel able to swim we will go.”\n“I shall never swim again,” replied Faria. “This arm is paralyzed; not for a time, but forever. Lift it, and judge if I am mistaken.”\nThe young man raised the arm, which fell back by its own weight, perfectly inanimate and helpless. A sigh escaped him.\n“You are convinced now, Edmond, are you not?” asked the abbé. “Depend upon it, I know what I say. Since the first attack I experienced of this malady, I have continually reflected on it. Indeed, I expected it, for it is a family inheritance; both my father and grandfather died of it in a third attack. The physician who prepared for me the remedy I have twice successfully taken, was no other than the celebrated Cabanis, and he predicted a similar end for me.”\n“The physician may be mistaken!” exclaimed Dantès. “And as for your poor arm, what difference will that make? I can take you on my shoulders, and swim for both of us.”\n“My son,” said the abbé, “you, who are a sailor and a swimmer, must know as well as I do that a man so loaded would sink before he had done fifty strokes. Cease, then, to allow yourself to be duped by vain hopes, that even your own excellent heart refuses to believe in. Here I shall remain till the hour of my deliverance arrives, and that, in all human probability, will be the hour of my death. As for you, who are young and active, delay not on my account, but fly—go—I give you back your promise.”\n“It is well,” said Dantès. “Then I shall also remain.” Then, rising and extending his hand with an air of solemnity over the old man’s head, he slowly added, “By the blood of Christ I swear never to leave you while you live.”\nFaria gazed fondly on his noble-minded, single-hearted, high-principled young friend, and read in his countenance ample confirmation of the sincerity of his devotion and the loyalty of his purpose.\n“Thanks,” murmured the invalid, extending one hand. “I accept. You may one of these days reap the reward of your disinterested devotion. But as I cannot, and you will not, quit this place, it becomes necessary to fill up the excavation beneath the soldier’s gallery; he might, by chance, hear the hollow sound of his footsteps, and call the attention of his officer to the circumstance. That would bring about a discovery which would inevitably lead to our being separated. Go, then, and set about this work, in which, unhappily, I can offer you no assistance; keep at it all night, if necessary, and do not return here tomorrow till after the jailer has visited me. I shall have something of the greatest importance to communicate to you.”\nDantès took the hand of the abbé in his, and affectionately pressed it. Faria smiled encouragingly on him, and the young man retired to his task, in the spirit of obedience and respect which he had sworn to show towards his aged friend.",

Oh, you have been my ruin!”\n\n“No,” said Dantès, with a chilling calm that seemed to freeze the very air around them. “If you had been taken to prison, you would have been condemned, and your punishment would have been the same. But it would have been a human punishment, and you would have thought it an injustice. You would have died blaspheming, and you would have been lost. Now,"

          "text_segment": "When Dantès returned next morning to the chamber of his companion in captivity, he found Faria seated and looking composed. In the ray of light which entered by the narrow window of his cell, he held open in his left hand, of which alone, it will be recollected, he retained the use, a sheet of paper, which, from being constantly rolled into a small compass, had the form of a cylinder, and was not easily kept open. He did not speak, but showed the paper to Dantès.\n“What is that?” he inquired.\n“Look at it,” said the abbé with a smile.\n“I have looked at it with all possible attention,” said Dantès, “and I only see a half-burnt paper, on which are traces of Gothic characters inscribed with a peculiar kind of ink.”\n“This paper, my friend,” said Faria, “I may now avow to you, since I have the proof of your fidelity—this paper is my treasure, of which, from this day forth, one-half belongs to you.”\nThe sweat started forth on Dantès’ brow. Until this day and for how long a time!—he had refrained from talking of the treasure, which had brought upon the abbé the accusation of madness. With his instinctive delicacy Edmond had preferred avoiding any touch on this painful chord, and Faria had been equally silent. He had taken the silence of the old man for a return to reason; and now these few words uttered by Faria, after so painful a crisis, seemed to indicate a serious relapse into mental alienation.\n“Your treasure?” stammered Dantès. Faria smiled.\n“Yes,” said he. “You have, indeed, a noble nature, Edmond, and I see by your paleness and agitation what is passing in your heart at this moment. No, be assured, I am not mad. This treasure exists, Dantès, and if I have not been allowed to possess it, you will. Yes—you. No one would listen or believe me, because everyone thought me mad; but you, who must know that I am not, listen to me, and believe me so afterwards if you will.”\n“Alas,” murmured Edmond to himself, “this is a terrible relapse! There was only this blow wanting.” Then he said aloud, “My dear friend, your attack has, perhaps, fatigued you; had you not better repose awhile? Tomorrow, if you will, I will hear your narrative; but today I wish to nurse you carefully. Besides,” he said, “a treasure is not a thing we need hurry about.”\n“On the contrary, it is a matter of the utmost importance, Edmond!” replied the old man. “Who knows if tomorrow, or the next day after, the third attack may not come on? and then must not all be over? Yes, indeed, I have often thought with a bitter joy that these riches, which would make the wealth of a dozen families, will be forever lost to those men who persecute me. This idea was one of vengeance to me, and I tasted it slowly in the night of my dungeon and the despair of my captivity. But now I have forgiven the world for the love of you; now that I see you, young and with a promising future,—now that I think of all that may result to you in the good fortune of such a disclosure, I shudder at any delay, and tremble lest I should not assure to one as worthy as yourself the possession of so vast an amount of hidden wealth.”\nEdmond turned away his head with a sigh.\n“You persist in your incredulity, Edmond,” continued Faria. “My words have not convinced you. I see you require proofs. Well, then, read this paper, which I have never shown to anyone.”\n“Tomorrow, my dear friend,” said Edmond, desirous of not yielding to the old man’s madness. “I thought it was understood that we should not talk of that until tomorrow.”\n“Then we will not talk of it until tomorrow; but read this paper today.”\n“I will not irritate him,” thought Edmond, and taking the paper, of which half was wanting,—having been burnt, no doubt, by some accident,—he read:\n“this treasure, which may amount to two...\nof Roman crowns in the most distant a...\nof the second opening wh...\ndeclare to belong to him alo...\nheir.\n                    “25th April, 149’”\n“Well!” said Faria, when the young man had finished reading it.\n“Why,” replied Dantès, “I see nothing but broken lines and unconnected words, which are rendered illegible by fire.”\n“Yes, to you, my friend, who read them for the first time; but not for me, who have grown pale over them by many nights’ study, and have reconstructed every phrase, completed every thought.”\n“And do you believe you have discovered the hidden meaning?”\n“I am sure I have, and you shall judge for yourself; but first listen to the history of this paper.”\n“Silence!” exclaimed Dantès. “Steps approach—I go—adieu!”\nAnd Dantès, happy to escape the history and explanation which would be sure to confirm his belief in his friend’s mental instability, glided like a snake along the narrow passage; while Faria, restored by his alarm to a certain amount of activity, pushed the stone into place with his foot, and covered it with a mat in order the more effectually to avoid discovery.",

He had of late, with a conscious effort, avoided alluding to the treasure which had been the prime cause of the abbé's reputation for madness. With the typical delicacy of those who are not themselves afflicted, he had feared to touch upon the sensitive chord in his companion's mind, and Faria, on his side, had been equally silent on the subject, which had led Dantès to believe the topic was forgotten. But now, a single word had revived all his fears.\n\n\"Your treasure?\" stammered Dantès.\n\nFaria smiled. \"Yes,\" said he. \"You are a noble fellow, Dantès, and I am proud of you. You shall have half of it.\"\n\nThe paroxysm of insanity, which Dantès had believed to be calmed, had returned with renewed force. He fell back in his chair, his heart sinking with despair. \"Oh, my dear friend,\" he cried, \"do not be angry with me, but I pray of you, do not speak of this. Let us not risk a relapse.\"\n\n\"I am not mad,\" Faria insisted calmly. \"The treasure I speak of really exists, and I am telling you this now because I fear another attack of catalepsy may seize me, and I shall not have time to give you the necessary instructions. The time has come to confide this secret to you.\"\n\n\"But of what use is this treasure to us?\" asked Dantès. \"We are prisoners.\"\n\n\"It will be of use to you after my death,\" said Faria. \"I have long thought with a miser's pleasure of keeping it for myself, but my affection for you has triumphed over my selfishness. You will be rich, and you will use your fortune to regain your happiness.\"\n\nDantès sighed. \"I hope I shall not be accused of selfishness in my turn,\" said he, \"if I say that I have no desire for wealth. I only wish for liberty.\"\n\n\"To a man a fortune is a tool for liberty,\" replied Faria. Seeing Dantès's continued skepticism, he urged, \"Read this paper, which I have never before shown to anyone.\"\n\n\"I will, to please you,\" said Dantès, taking the paper, which he did not, however, read at once. He still wished to defer the conversation.\n\n\"Read it,\" repeated the abbé.\n\nDantès, to placate him, cast his eyes upon the document and read:\n\n*This 25th day of April, 1498, be...*\n*...Alexander VI., and fearing that not...*\n*...he may be tempted to ruin me, I, C...*\n*...declare to my nephew, Guido Spada...*\n*...sole heir, that I have buried in a place he knows...*\n*...and has visited with me, that is, in...*\n*...the caves of the small isle of Monte Cristo, all...*\n*...I possessed of ingots, gold, money, jewels...*\n*...diamonds, gems; that I alone...*\n*...know of the existence of this treasure, which may amount to...*\n*...nearly two millions of Roman crowns, and which he will find...*\n*...on raising the",

MISSING ELEMENTS:\n- The completion does not include the internal reflections of Dantès regarding his reluctance to discuss the treasure and his concerns about Faria's mental state.\n- The content of the mysterious paper, including the fragmented lines and the date, is entirely absent.\n- The subsequent dialogue where Faria insists on the reality of the treasure and Dantès expresses skepticism is missing.\n- The interruption caused by approaching footsteps and Dantès' departure, as well as Faria's actions to conceal their activities, are not present.\n\n3. INACCURATE ELEMENTS:\n- The completion omits the detail about Faria only having the use of one hand, which is an important character detail in this context.\n- The emotional responses of both characters are underdeveloped; for example, Dantès' internal struggle and Faria's insistence on the urgency of the matter are not fully conveyed.\n- The sequence of events is incomplete, as the narrative does not progress beyond the initial presentation of the paper, missing the escalation and resolution of the scene.\n\nTo improve, ensure the full sequence of events is included, capture the internal thoughts and emotional dynamics, and represent all key actions and exchanges in the order they occur in the original passage."

It will pass as it has passed before.” The governor looked around the cell, his gaze suspicious. “We thought we heard two voices.” Faria managed a faint smile. “I was delirious, monsieur. In my fits, I often argue with the ghosts of my past. It is a lonely man’s only company.” The governor seemed unconvinced but had no proof. He offered the services of a doctor, which Faria politely refused, knowing any examination would reveal his partial paralysis and hasten his transfer to the dreaded infirmary.

The pope had also need of money to bring matters to an end with Louis XII. King of France, who was formidable still in spite of his recent reverses; and it was necessary, therefore, to have recourse to some profitable scheme, which was a matter of great difficulty in the impoverished condition of exhausted Italy. His holiness had an idea. He determined to make two cardinals.’\n“By choosing two of the greatest personages of Rome, especially rich men—this was the return the Holy Father looked for. In the first place, he could sell the great appointments and splendid offices which the cardinals already held; and then he had the two hats to sell besides. There was a third point in view, which will appear hereafter.\n“The pope and Cæsar Borgia first found the two future cardinals; they were Giovanni Rospigliosi, who held four of the highest dignities of the Holy See, and Cæsar Spada, one of the noblest and richest of the Roman nobility; both felt the high honor of such a favor from the pope. They were ambitious, and Cæsar Borgia soon found purchasers for their appointments. The result was, that Rospigliosi and Spada paid for being cardinals, and eight other persons paid for the offices the cardinals held before their elevation, and thus eight hundred thousand crowns entered into the coffers of the speculators.\n“It is time now to proceed to the last part of the speculation. The pope heaped attentions upon Rospigliosi and Spada, conferred upon them the insignia of the cardinalate, and induced them to arrange their affairs and take up their residence at Rome. Then the pope and Cæsar Borgia invited the two cardinals to dinner. This was a matter of dispute between the Holy Father and his son. Cæsar thought they could make use of one of the means which he always had ready for his friends, that is to say, in the first place, the famous key which was given to certain persons with the request that they go and open a designated cupboard. This key was furnished with a small iron point,—a negligence on the part of the locksmith. When this was pressed to effect the opening of the cupboard, of which the lock was difficult, the person was pricked by this small point, and died next day. Then there was the ring with the lion’s head, which Cæsar wore when he wanted to greet his friends with a clasp of the hand. The lion bit the hand thus favored, and at the end of twenty-four hours, the bite was mortal.\n“Cæsar proposed to his father, that they should either ask the cardinals to open the cupboard, or shake hands with them; but Alexander VI. replied: ‘Now as to the worthy cardinals, Spada and Rospigliosi, let us ask both of them to dinner, something tells me that we shall get that money back. Besides, you forget, Cæsar, an indigestion declares itself immediately, while a prick or a bite occasions a delay of a day or two.’ Cæsar gave way before such cogent reasoning, and the cardinals were consequently invited to dinner.\n“The table was laid in a vineyard belonging to the pope, near San Pierdarena, a charming retreat which the cardinals knew very well by report. Rospigliosi, quite set up with his new dignities, went with a good appetite and his most ingratiating manner. Spada, a prudent man, and greatly attached to his only nephew, a young captain of the highest promise, took paper and pen, and made his will. He then sent word to his nephew to wait for him near the vineyard; but it appeared the servant did not find him.\n“Spada knew what these invitations meant; since Christianity, so eminently civilizing, had made progress in Rome, it was no longer a centurion who came from the tyrant with a message, ‘Cæsar wills that you die.’ but it was a legate à latere, who came with a smile on his lips to say from the pope, ‘His holiness requests you to dine with him.’\n“Spada set out about two o’clock to San Pierdarena. The pope awaited him. The first sight that attracted the eyes of Spada was that of his nephew, in full costume, and Cæsar Borgia paying him most marked attentions. Spada turned pale, as Cæsar looked at him with an ironical air, which proved that he had anticipated all, and that the snare was well spread.\n“They began dinner and Spada was only able to inquire of his nephew if he had received his message. The nephew replied no; perfectly comprehending the meaning of the question. It was too late, for he had already drunk a glass of excellent wine, placed for him expressly by the pope’s butler. Spada at the same moment saw another bottle approach him, which he was pressed to taste. An hour afterwards a physician declared they were both poisoned through eating mushrooms. Spada died on the threshold of the vineyard; the nephew expired at his own door, making signs which his wife could not comprehend.\n“Then Cæsar and the pope hastened to lay hands on the heritage, under pretense of seeking for the papers of the dead man. But the inheritance consisted in this only, a scrap of paper on which Spada had written:—‘I bequeath to my beloved nephew my coffers, my books, and, amongst others, my breviary with the gold corners, which I beg he will preserve in remembrance of his affectionate uncle.’\n“The heirs sought everywhere, admired the breviary, laid hands on the furniture, and were greatly astonished that Spada, the rich man, was really the most miserable of uncles—no treasures—unless they were those of science, contained in the library and laboratories. That was all. Cæsar and his father searched, examined, scrutinized, but found nothing, or at least very little; not exceeding a few thousand crowns in plate, and about the same in ready money; but the nephew had time to say to his wife before he expired: ‘Look well among my uncle’s papers; there is a will.’\n“They sought even more thoroughly than the august heirs had done, but it was fruitless. There were two palaces and a vineyard behind the Palatine Hill; but in these days landed property had not much value, and the two palaces and the vineyard remained to the family since they were beneath the rapacity of the pope and his son. Months and years rolled on. Alexander VI. died, poisoned,—you know by what mistake. Cæsar, poisoned at the same time, escaped by shedding his skin like a snake; but the new skin was spotted by the poison till it looked like a tiger’s. Then, compelled to quit Rome, he went and got himself obscurely killed in a night skirmish, scarcely noticed in history.\n“After the pope’s death and his son’s exile, it was supposed that the Spada family would resume the splendid position they had held before the cardinal’s time; but this was not the case. The Spadas remained in doubtful ease, a mystery hung over this dark affair, and the public rumor was, that Cæsar, a better politician than his father, had carried off from the pope the fortune of the two cardinals. I say the two, because Cardinal Rospigliosi, who had not taken any precaution, was completely despoiled.",

          "text_segment": "“Up to this point,” said Faria, interrupting the thread of his narrative, “this seems to you very meaningless, no doubt, eh?”\n“Oh, my friend,” cried Dantès, “on the contrary, it seems as if I were reading a most interesting narrative; go on, I beg of you.”\n“I will. The family began to get accustomed to their obscurity. Years rolled on, and amongst the descendants some were soldiers, others diplomatists; some churchmen, some bankers; some grew rich, and some were ruined. I come now to the last of the family, whose secretary I was—the Count of Spada. I had often heard him complain of the disproportion of his rank with his fortune; and I advised him to invest all he had in an annuity. He did so, and thus doubled his income. The celebrated breviary remained in the family, and was in the count’s possession. It had been handed down from father to son; for the singular clause of the only will that had been found, had caused it to be regarded as a genuine relic, preserved in the family with superstitious veneration. It was an illuminated book, with beautiful Gothic characters, and so weighty with gold, that a servant always carried it before the cardinal on days of great solemnity.\n“At the sight of papers of all sorts,—titles, contracts, parchments, which were kept in the archives of the family, all descending from the poisoned cardinal, I in my turn examined the immense bundles of documents, like twenty servitors, stewards, secretaries before me; but in spite of the most exhaustive researches, I found—nothing. Yet I had read, I had even written a precise history of the Borgia family, for the sole purpose of assuring myself whether any increase of fortune had occurred to them on the death of the Cardinal Cæsar Spada; but could only trace the acquisition of the property of the Cardinal Rospigliosi, his companion in misfortune.\n“I was then almost assured that the inheritance had neither profited the Borgias nor the family, but had remained unpossessed like the treasures of the Arabian Nights, which slept in the bosom of the earth under the eyes of the genie. I searched, ransacked, counted, calculated a thousand and a thousand times the income and expenditure of the family for three hundred years. It was useless. I remained in my ignorance, and the Count of Spada in his poverty.\n“My patron died. He had reserved from his annuity his family papers, his library, composed of five thousand volumes, and his famous breviary. All these he bequeathed to me, with a thousand Roman crowns, which he had in ready money, on condition that I would have anniversary masses said for the repose of his soul, and that I would draw up a genealogical tree and history of his house. All this I did scrupulously. Be easy, my dear Edmond, we are near the conclusion.\n“In 1807, a month before I was arrested, and a fortnight after the death of the Count of Spada, on the 25th of December (you will see presently how the date became fixed in my memory), I was reading, for the thousandth time, the papers I was arranging, for the palace was sold to a stranger, and I was going to leave Rome and settle at Florence, intending to take with me twelve thousand francs I possessed, my library, and the famous breviary, when, tired with my constant labor at the same thing, and overcome by a heavy dinner I had eaten, my head dropped on my hands, and I fell asleep about three o’clock in the afternoon.\n“I awoke as the clock was striking six. I raised my head; I was in utter darkness. I rang for a light, but, as no one came, I determined to find one for myself. It was indeed but anticipating the simple manners which I should soon be under the necessity of adopting. I took a wax-candle in one hand, and with the other groped about for a piece of paper (my match-box being empty), with which I proposed to get a light from the small flame still playing on the embers. Fearing, however, to make use of any valuable piece of paper, I hesitated for a moment, then recollected that I had seen in the famous breviary, which was on the table beside me, an old paper quite yellow with age, and which had served as a marker for centuries, kept there by the request of the heirs. I felt for it, found it, twisted it up together, and putting it into the expiring flame, set light to it.\n“But beneath my fingers, as if by magic, in proportion as the fire ascended, I saw yellowish characters appear on the paper. I grasped it in my hand, put out the flame as quickly as I could, lighted my taper in the fire itself, and opened the crumpled paper with inexpressible emotion, recognizing, when I had done so, that these characters had been traced in mysterious and sympathetic ink, only appearing when exposed to the fire; nearly one-third of the paper had been consumed by the flame. It was that paper you read this morning; read it again, Dantès, and then I will complete for you the incomplete words and unconnected sense.”",

            "Dantès read the message, which, though more complete, was still fragmented. It spoke of Cardinal Spada's actions on April 25, 1498, his fear of Pope Alexander VI, and a treasure concealed on the Island of Monte Cristo.",
            "Faria then produced a second piece of paper containing additional fragments, which Dantès also read.",
            "At Faria's direction, Dantès combined the two fragments.",
            "The joined pieces formed a complete declaration by Cardinal Cæsar Spada, revealing his anxieties about Pope Alexander VI and Cæsar Borgia.",
            "The document stated that Cardinal Spada had buried his entire fortune—ingots, gold, currency, jewels, and gems—in the caves of the small Island of Monte Cristo, a location familiar to his nephew, Guido Spada.",
            "The will specified the treasure's value at nearly two million Roman crowns and provided precise instructions for its retrieval: by lifting the twentieth rock from the small eastern creek in a direct line, leading to two openings in caves, with the treasure located in the farthest angle of the second opening.",
            "The Cardinal bequeathed this entire treasure to his nephew Guido Spada as his sole heir, the document dated April 25, 1498.",
            "Faria inquired if Dantès now understood the significance of the document.",
            "Dantès, though still tinged with incredulity, acknowledged it as Cardinal Spada's long-lost declaration and will.",
            "Faria affirmed this with great enthusiasm, explaining that he had deciphered the complete message by deducing the missing portions based on the surviving text, the length of the lines, and the overall context, much like navigating a cavern by a faint ray of light.",
            "He revealed that he had resolved to pursue the treasure immediately upon this discovery, while also carrying his treatise on the unification of Italy, but was apprehended by imperial police in Piombino, their suspicions aroused by his unexplained, hasty departure.",
            "Addressing Dantès with paternal warmth, Faria stated that Dantès now possessed all the knowledge he himself had.",
            "He then made a solemn promise: if they were to escape prison together, half of the treasure would belong to Dantès; if Dantès escaped alone, the entire fortune would be his.",
            "Dantès hesitated, questioning whether there might be a more rightful living heir to the treasure.",
            "Faria reassured him, stating the Spada family line was extinct. Moreover, the last Count of Spada had made Faria his heir, bequeathing him the symbolic breviary and all it contained, thus ensuring they could claim the fortune without moral reservations.",
            "Faria disclosed the treasure's estimated value: two million Roman crowns, equivalent to nearly thirteen million francs in their contemporary currency.",
            "Dantès, overwhelmed by the immense sum, exclaimed that it was impossible.",
            "Faria countered by explaining that such vast accumulations of wealth were not uncommon for powerful fifteenth-century families who lacked modern investment opportunities, citing current Roman families impoverished despite possessing entailed, inaccessible fortunes in jewels.",
            "Edmond felt as though he were dreaming, caught between disbelief and burgeoning joy.",
            "Faria explained his delay in revealing the secret: he wished first to test Dantès's character and then to surprise him. He lamented that had they escaped before his paralytic attack, he would have guided Dantès to Monte Cristo; now, he said with a sigh, Dantès would be the one to guide him.",
            "Faria gently chided Dantès for not yet expressing gratitude.",
            "Dantès responded that the treasure rightfully belonged to Faria alone, as he, Dantès, had no claim to it and was no relation.",
            "Faria, deeply moved, exclaimed that Dantès was his son, the child of his captivity, sent by Providence to comfort him, fulfilling both the role of a father he could never be and a companion in imprisonment.",

Aided by the remaining fragment, I guessed the rest; measuring the length of the lines by those of the paper, and divining the hidden meaning by means of what was in part revealed, as we are guided in a cavern by the small ray of light above us.”\n“And what did you do when you arrived at this conclusion?”\n“I resolved to set out, and did set out at that very instant, carrying with me the beginning of my great work, the unity of the Italian kingdom; but for some time the imperial police (who at this period, quite contrary to what Napoleon desired so soon as he had a son born to him, wished for a partition of provinces) had their eyes on me; and my hasty departure, the cause of which they were unable to guess, having aroused their suspicions, I was arrested at the very moment I was leaving Piombino.\n“Now,” continued Faria, addressing Dantès with an almost paternal expression, “now, my dear fellow, you know as much as I do myself. If we ever escape together, half this treasure is yours; if I die here, and you escape alone, the whole belongs to you.”\n“But,” inquired Dantès hesitating, “has this treasure no more legitimate possessor in the world than ourselves?”\n“No, no, be easy on that score; the family is extinct. The last Count of Spada, moreover, made me his heir, bequeathing to me this symbolic breviary, he bequeathed to me all it contained; no, no, make your mind satisfied on that point. If we lay hands on this fortune, we may enjoy it without remorse.”\n“And you say this treasure amounts to——”\n“Two millions of Roman crowns; nearly thirteen millions of our money.”\n“Impossible!” said Dantès, staggered at the enormous amount.\n“Impossible? and why?” asked the old man. “The Spada family was one of the oldest and most powerful families of the fifteenth century; and in those times, when other opportunities for investment were wanting, such accumulations of gold and jewels were by no means rare; there are at this day Roman families perishing of hunger, though possessed of nearly a million in diamonds and jewels, handed down by entail, and which they cannot touch.”\nEdmond thought he was in a dream—he wavered between incredulity and joy.\n“I have only kept this secret so long from you,” continued Faria, “that I might test your character, and then surprise you. Had we escaped before my attack of catalepsy, I should have conducted you to Monte Cristo; now,” he added, with a sigh, “it is you who will conduct me thither. Well, Dantès, you do not thank me?”\n“This treasure belongs to you, my dear friend,” replied Dantès, “and to you only. I have no right to it. I am no relation of yours.”\n“You are my son, Dantès,” exclaimed the old man. “You are the child of my captivity. My profession condemns me to celibacy. God has sent you to me to console, at one and the same time, the man who could not be a father, and the prisoner who could not get free.”\nAnd Faria extended the arm of which alone the use remained to him to the young man, who threw himself upon his neck and wept.",

If we ever escape together, half this fortune is yours; if I die here and you escape alone, the whole belongs to you.\\\"\\n\\n\\\"But,\\\" hesitated Dantès, \\\"has this treasure no more legitimate possessor in this world than ourselves?\\\"\\n\\n\\\"No, none,\\\" Faria assured him. \\\"The family is extinct. The last Count of Spada made me his heir, bequeathing to me this symbolic breviary, and in it, all that it contained. No, do not doubt it; the treasure is ours.\\\"\\n\\nHe paused, his eyes gleaming. \\\"This treasure consists of two million Roman crowns, nearly thirteen million of our francs!\\\"\\n\\n\\\"Impossible!\\\" exclaimed Dantès, staggered by the immensity of the sum.\\n\\n\\\"Impossible?\\\" Faria retorted. \\\"The Spada family was one of the oldest and most powerful of the fifteenth century. Such a fortune was not unusual for them, who had no means of investing their capital as we do now. And now,\\\" he said with a sigh, \\\"had we escaped before my attack, I would have led you to Monte Cristo; now, it is you who will lead me there.\\\"\\n\\nFaria smiled gently. \\\"You have not yet thanked me, Edmond.\\\"\\n\\n\\\"But the treasure belongs to you, my good friend,\\\" Dantès replied. \\\"I have no right to it. I am no relation of yours.\\\"\\n\\n\\\"You are my son!\\\" cried the old man, deeply moved. \\\"You are the child of my captivity. My profession condemns me to celibacy, yet Providence has sent you to me to console at once the man who could not be a father, and the prisoner who could not be free.\\\" And Faria extended the one arm he could still command to Dantès, who threw himself upon his neck and wept.\"\n}\n```",

They had repaired it completely, and stopped up with vast masses of stone the hole Dantès had partly filled in. But for this precaution, which, it will be remembered, the abbé had made to Edmond, the misfortune would have been still greater, for their attempt to escape would have been detected, and they would undoubtedly have been separated.

But my real treasure is not that, my dear friend, which awaits me beneath the sombre rocks of Monte Cristo, it is your presence, our living together five or six hours a day, in spite of our jailers; it is the rays of intelligence you have elicited from my brain, the languages you have implanted in my memory, and which have taken root there with all their philological ramifications. These different sciences that you have made so easy to me by the depth of the knowledge you possess of them, and the clearness of the principles to which you have reduced them—this is my treasure, my beloved friend, and with this you have made me rich and happy. Believe me, and take comfort, this is better for me than tons of gold and cases of diamonds, even were they not as problematical as the clouds we see in the morning floating over the sea, which we take for terra firma, and which evaporate and vanish as we draw near to them. To have you as long as possible near me, to hear your eloquent speech,—which embellishes my mind, strengthens my soul, and makes my whole frame capable of great and terrible things, if I should ever be free,—so fills my whole existence, that the despair to which I was just on the point of yielding when I knew you, has no longer any hold over me; and this—this is my fortune—not chimerical, but actual. I owe you my real good, my present happiness; and all the sovereigns of the earth, even Cæsar Borgia himself, could not deprive me of this.”\nThus, if not actually happy, yet the days these two unfortunates passed together went quickly. Faria, who for so long a time had kept silence as to the treasure, now perpetually talked of it. As he had prophesied would be the case, he remained paralyzed in the right arm and the left leg, and had given up all hope of ever enjoying it himself. But he was continually thinking over some means of escape for his young companion, and anticipating the pleasure he would enjoy. For fear the letter might be some day lost or stolen, he compelled Dantès to learn it by heart; and Dantès knew it from the first to the last word. Then he destroyed the second portion, assured that if the first were seized, no one would be able to discover its real meaning. Whole hours sometimes passed while Faria was giving instructions to Dantès,—instructions which were to serve him when he was at liberty. Then, once free, from the day and hour and moment when he was so, he could have but one only thought, which was, to gain Monte Cristo by some means, and remain there alone under some pretext which would arouse no suspicions; and once there, to endeavor to find the wonderful caverns, and search in the appointed spot,—the appointed spot, be it remembered, being the farthest angle in the second opening.",

They were thus perpetually employed,—Faria, that he might not see himself grow old; Dantès, for fear of recalling the almost extinct past which now only floated in his memory like a distant light wandering in the night. So life went on for them as it does for those who are not victims of misfortune and whose activities glide along mechanically and tranquilly beneath the eye of Providence.\nBut beneath this superficial calm there were in the heart of the young man, and perhaps in that of the old man, many repressed desires, many stifled sighs, which found vent when Faria was left alone, and when Edmond returned to his cell.\nOne night Edmond awoke suddenly, believing that he heard someone calling him. He opened his eyes upon utter darkness. His name, or rather a plaintive voice which essayed to pronounce his name, reached him. He sat up in bed and a cold sweat broke out upon his brow. Undoubtedly the call came from Faria’s dungeon.\n“Alas,” murmured Edmond; “can it be?”\nHe moved his bed, drew up the stone, rushed into the passage, and reached the opposite extremity; the secret entrance was open.

          "text_segment": "“Alas, my dear friend,” said Faria in a resigned tone, “you understand, do you not, and I need not attempt to explain to you?”\nEdmond uttered a cry of agony, and, quite out of his senses, rushed towards the door, exclaiming, “Help, help!”\nFaria had just sufficient strength to restrain him.\n“Silence,” he said, “or you are lost. We must now only think of you, my dear friend, and so act as to render your captivity supportable or your flight possible. It would require years to do again what I have done here, and the results would be instantly destroyed if our jailers knew we had communicated with each other. Besides, be assured, my dear Edmond, the dungeon I am about to leave will not long remain empty; some other unfortunate being will soon take my place, and to him you will appear like an angel of salvation. Perhaps he will be young, strong, and enduring, like yourself, and will aid you in your escape, while I have been but a hindrance. You will no longer have half a dead body tied to you as a drag to all your movements. At length Providence has done something for you; he restores to you more than he takes away, and it was time I should die.”\nEdmond could only clasp his hands and exclaim, “Oh, my friend, my friend, speak not thus!” and then resuming all his presence of mind, which had for a moment staggered under this blow, and his strength, which had failed at the words of the old man, he said, “Oh, I have saved you once, and I will save you a second time!” And raising the foot of the bed, he drew out the phial, still a third filled with the red liquor.\n“See,” he exclaimed, “there remains still some of the magic draught. Quick, quick! tell me what I must do this time; are there any fresh instructions? Speak, my friend; I listen.”\n“There is not a hope,” replied Faria, shaking his head, “but no matter; God wills it that man whom he has created, and in whose heart he has so profoundly rooted the love of life, should do all in his power to preserve that existence, which, however painful it may be, is yet always so dear.”\n“Oh, yes, yes!” exclaimed Dantès; “and I tell you that I will save you yet.”\n“Well, then, try. The cold gains upon me. I feel the blood flowing towards my brain. These horrible chills, which make my teeth chatter and seem to dislocate my bones, begin to pervade my whole frame; in five minutes the malady will reach its height, and in a quarter of an hour there will be nothing left of me but a corpse.”\n“Oh!” exclaimed Dantès, his heart wrung with anguish.\n“Do as you did before, only do not wait so long, all the springs of life are now exhausted in me, and death,” he continued, looking at his paralyzed arm and leg, “has but half its work to do. If, after having made me swallow twelve drops instead of ten, you see that I do not recover, then pour the rest down my throat. Now lift me on my bed, for I can no longer support myself.”\nEdmond took the old man in his arms, and laid him on the bed.\n“And now, my dear friend,” said Faria, “sole consolation of my wretched existence,—you whom Heaven gave me somewhat late, but still gave me, a priceless gift, and for which I am most grateful,—at the moment of separating from you forever, I wish you all the happiness and all the prosperity you so well deserve. My son, I bless thee!”\nThe young man cast himself on his knees, leaning his head against the old man’s bed.\n“Listen, now, to what I say in this my dying moment. The treasure of the Spadas exists. God grants me the boon of vision unrestricted by time or space. I see it in the depths of the inner cavern. My eyes pierce the inmost recesses of the earth, and are dazzled at the sight of so much riches. If you do escape, remember that the poor abbé, whom all the world called mad, was not so. Hasten to Monte Cristo—avail yourself of the fortune—for you have indeed suffered long enough.”\nA violent convulsion attacked the old man. Dantès raised his head and saw Faria’s eyes injected with blood. It seemed as if a flow of blood had ascended from the chest to the head.\n“Adieu, adieu!” murmured the old man, clasping Edmond’s hand convulsively—“adieu!”\n“Oh, no,—no, not yet,” he cried; “do not forsake me! Oh, succor him! Help—help—help!”\n“Hush! hush!” murmured the dying man, “that they may not separate us if you save me!”\n“You are right. Oh, yes, yes; be assured I shall save you! Besides, although you suffer much, you do not seem to be in such agony as you were before.”\n“Do not mistake! I suffer less because there is in me less strength to endure. At your age we have faith in life; it is the privilege of youth to believe and hope, but old men see death more clearly. Oh, ’tis here—’tis here—’tis over—my sight is gone—my senses fail! Your hand, Dantès! Adieu! adieu!”\nAnd raising himself by a final effort, in which he summoned all his faculties, he said,—“Monte Cristo, forget not Monte Cristo!” And he fell back on the bed.\nThe crisis was terrible, and a rigid form with twisted limbs, swollen eyelids, and lips flecked with bloody foam, lay on the bed of torture, in place of the intellectual being who so lately rested there.\nDantès took the lamp, placed it on a projecting stone above the bed, whence its tremulous light fell with strange and fantastic ray on the distorted countenance and motionless, stiffened body. With steady gaze he awaited confidently the moment for administering the restorative.\nWhen he believed that the right moment had arrived, he took the knife, pried open the teeth, which offered less resistance than before, counted one after the other twelve drops, and watched; the phial contained, perhaps, twice as much more. He waited ten minutes, a quarter of an hour, half an hour,—no change took place. Trembling, his hair erect, his brow bathed with perspiration, he counted the seconds by the beating of his heart. Then he thought it was time to make the last trial, and he put the phial to the purple lips of Faria, and without having occasion to force open his jaws, which had remained extended, he poured the whole of the liquid down his throat.\nThe draught produced a galvanic effect, a violent trembling pervaded the old man’s limbs, his eyes opened until it was fearful to gaze upon them, he heaved a sigh which resembled a shriek, and then his convulsed body returned gradually to its former immobility, the eyes remaining open.",

            "prefix-probing": "“Oh, yes, yes,” cried Dantès, “I understand but too well. The third attack. You are lost!” He fell to his knees beside the old man’s pallet, his face a mask of despair. All the hope that had blossomed in his heart over the past years, nurtured by the abbe’s wisdom and companionship, withered in an instant. To lose this man, his second father, his intellectual savior, was a blow more cruel than his initial imprisonment. “Oh, my friend, my friend!” he sobbed, clutching Faria’s cold hand. “Do not say that! There is still hope. The doctor… I will call the guards, I will beg them, I will promise them anything!”\n\nFaria managed a faint, sad smile. “Listen,” he said, his voice a mere thread of sound, yet filled with an urgent intensity that commanded Dantès’ full attention. “The time for doctors and guards is past. My life is measured now not in days, but in minutes. Do not waste them on futile efforts. You must listen to me, Edmond, for what I have to tell you is the reason Providence brought us together in this abyss.”\n\nHe paused, gathering what little strength remained. His eyes, though clouded with the shadow of death, burned with a feverish light. “You have been a son to me, Edmond. You have listened to my teachings, you have eased the loneliness of my long captivity, and you have given an old man the gift of affection. I must repay this debt. I had intended to share my fortune with you upon our escape, but now… now it must all be yours. You alone will be my heir.”\n\n“Your fortune?” Dantès repeated, bewildered. “What fortune can a prisoner possess?”\n\n“A fortune so immense, my boy, that it would make kings of ordinary men,” Faria whispered, his breath catching. “A treasure that has been the secret of my life, the cause of my imprisonment, and now, the instrument of your future freedom and power. Listen closely, for I may not have the strength to repeat myself.”\n\nDantès leaned in, his ear almost touching the abbe’s lips, his own grief momentarily suspended by the gravity of Faria’s words.\n\n“The treasure,” Faria began, his voice gaining a strange, spectral energy as he delved into the past, “belonged to the noble Spada family, one of the oldest and wealthiest in Italy. I was the secretary and confidant to the last of that line, Cardinal Spada. In the fifteenth century, at the time of Cesare Borgia and his father, Pope Alexander VI, the Spada family was possessed of a colossal fortune. The Borgias, as you know, had a particular method for inheriting from the cardinals and nobles of Rome; they would invite them to dinner. Cardinal Spada, suspecting their design, took measures to protect his wealth.”\n\n“Before attending a fateful dinner from which he knew he would not return alive, he concealed his entire portable fortune—gold, jewels, precious stones—on a small, deserted island known only to him. He then created two wills. One, a public document, bequeathed his landed estates and his library to the Holy See, a pittance to deceive the avaricious Pope. The other, the true will, revealed the location of the hidden treasure. This document, written in invisible ink, was concealed within the Cardinal’s breviary.”\n\nFaria coughed, a dry, rattling sound that shook his frail body. Dantès offered him a few drops of water, which he sipped gratefully.\n\n“The Cardinal and his designated heir were both poisoned,” Faria continued. “The secret was lost. The Spada family fell into relative poverty, and for three centuries, the treasure lay undisturbed, a legend whispered among the descendants. I, as the last Cardinal Spada’s loyal servant, inherited his library and his papers. For years, I searched for a clue, a hint, anything. I read every book, examined every document. It was not until 1807, just before my arrest, that I found it.”\n\nHis eyes gleamed. “It was an accident, a moment of pure chance. I was mending a tear in a piece of vellum, a blank sheet I had used for notes. As I held it to the fire to dry the glue, faint yellow letters began to appear. It was the secret will! The heat had revealed the sympathetic ink. The document, which had appeared to be nothing more than a flyleaf in an old book, contained the inventory and location of the Spada treasure.”\n\nDantès listened, spellbound, the grim reality of the Chateau d’If melting away, replaced by visions of papal intrigue and fabulous wealth.\n\n“And the location?” he breathed.\n\n“The island of Monte Cristo,” Faria declared, his voice rising with a final surge of triumph. “A small, granite isle off the coast of Tuscany, between Corsica and the island of Elba. Uninhabited, wild, and forgotten. The will was precise. From the small eastern creek, one must walk in a straight line towards the highest peak. At the twenty-sixth rock, a secret opening, concealed by a boulder"

Dantès saw that he could not get into Faria’s cell without being seen. He therefore gave up the attempt, and waited where he was. Then, all at once, he heard a cry, followed by the sound of a struggle, and then the regular tramp of a body of men. In a moment the noise became more distinct; he heard the tread of soldiers, and then the voice of the governor himself, who was giving some orders. At the same time, he heard the noise of a key turning in the lock of the abbe’s door, and then a cry of surprise and terror. Two or three cries followed, and then a profound silence. Then he heard the governor say, in a low voice, “Take away that man.” Immediately the sound of arms and of boots was heard in the gallery; they were taking the sentinel away. Then the governor’s voice was heard again, saying, “Bring the doctor.” A moment after, the door of Faria’s cell was opened, and the governor entered, followed by a turnkey with a light. Dantès saw the governor look round the cell, and then he heard him say, “He is dead, but he is not cold. Let us try if we can restore him to life. Throw some water on his face.” The turnkey obeyed, and Dantès heard the splash of the water. “It is useless,” said the governor; “he is dead. Go and tell the doctor to come and certify his death, and in the meantime, let him be buried in the usual way.” The governor went out, and the turnkey followed him, leaving the door open. Immediately, Dantès heard the sound of other footsteps in the gallery, and a moment after, the door of the cell was again opened, and two or three men entered. They were the undertaker’s men. They began to move the body, and Dantès heard them say, in a low voice, “He is not heavy for an old man.” “They say he was a priest,” said another. “He was a very rich priest,” said a third; “they say he had a treasure.” “He was a madman,” said a fourth. “Well, well,” said the first, “mad or not, he is dead, and that is all we have to do with him. Let us get him into the sack.” And Dantès heard the sound of the body being put into a sack. “What a pity he was not a little fatter,” said one of the men; “it would have been a better job for us.” “There is no great profit",

The worthy man had gone on his errand, and that was all. Dantès listened. The noise of the measured tread of the sentinel was heard from the gallery. He was evidently walking up and down. Dantès saw that he could not get into Faria’s cell without being seen. He therefore gave up the attempt, and waited where he was. Then, all at once, he heard a cry, followed by the sound of a struggle, and then the regular tramp of a body of men. In a moment the noise became more distinct; he heard the tread of soldiers, and then the voice of the governor himself, who was giving some orders. At the same time, he heard the noise of a key turning in the lock of the abbe’s door, and then a cry of surprise and terror. Two or three cries followed, and then a profound silence. Then he heard the governor say, in a low voice, “Take away that man.” Immediately the sound of arms and of boots was heard in the gallery; they were taking the sentinel away. Then the governor’s voice was heard again, saying, “Bring the doctor.” A moment after, the door of Faria’s cell was opened, and the governor entered, followed by a turnkey with a light. Dantès saw the governor look round the cell, and then he heard him say, “He is dead, but he is not cold. Let us try if we can restore him to life. Throw some water on his face.” The turnkey obeyed, and Dantès heard the splash of the water. “It is useless,” said the governor; “he is dead. Go and tell the doctor to come and certify his death, and in the meantime, let him be buried in the usual way.” The governor went out, and the turnkey followed him, leaving the door open. Immediately, Dantès heard the sound of other footsteps in the gallery, and a moment after, the door of the cell was again opened, and two or three men entered. They were the undertaker’s men. They began to move the body, and Dantès heard them say, in a low voice, “He is not heavy for an old man.” “They say he was a priest,” said another. “He was a very rich priest,” said a third; “they say he had a treasure.” “He was a madman,” said a fourth. “Well, well,” said the first, “mad or not, he is dead, and that is all we have to do with him. Let us get him into the sack.” And Dantès heard the sound of the body being put into a sack. “What a pity he was not a little fatter,” said one of the men; “it would have been a better job for us.” “There is no great profit",

I will answer for that.”\n“You know, sir,” said the governor, persisting, “that we are not content in such cases as this with such a simple examination. In spite of all appearances, be so kind, therefore, as to finish your duty by fulfilling the formalities described by law.”\n“Let the irons be heated,” said the doctor; “but really it is a useless precaution.”\nThis order to heat the irons made Dantès shudder. He heard hasty steps, the creaking of a door, people going and coming, and some minutes afterwards a turnkey entered, saying:\n“Here is the brazier, lighted.”\nThere was a moment’s silence, and then was heard the crackling of burning flesh, of which the peculiar and nauseous smell penetrated even behind the wall where Dantès was listening in horror. The perspiration poured forth upon the young man’s brow, and he felt as if he should faint.\n“You see, sir, he is really dead,” said the doctor; “this burn in the heel is decisive. The poor fool is cured of his folly, and delivered from his captivity.”\n“Wasn’t his name Faria?” inquired one of the officers who accompanied the governor.\n“Yes, sir; and, as he said, it was an ancient name. He was, too, very learned, and rational enough on all points which did not relate to his treasure; but on that, indeed, he was intractable.”\n“It is the sort of malady which we call monomania,” said the doctor.\n“You had never anything to complain of?” said the governor to the jailer who had charge of the abbé.\n“Never, sir,” replied the jailer, “never; on the contrary, he sometimes amused me very much by telling me stories. One day, too, when my wife was ill, he gave me a prescription which cured her.”\n“Ah, ah!” said the doctor, “I did not know that I had a rival; but I hope, governor, that you will show him all proper respect in consequence.”",

I told him I would attend to the prisoners in his absence. If the poor abbé had not been in such a hurry, he might have had his requiem.”\n“Pooh, pooh;” said the doctor, with the impiety usual in persons of his profession; “he is a churchman. God will respect his profession, and not give the devil the wicked delight of sending him a priest.” A shout of laughter followed this brutal jest. Meanwhile the operation of putting the body in the sack was going on.\n“This evening,” said the governor, when the task was ended.\n“At what hour?” inquired a turnkey.\n“Why, about ten or eleven o’clock.”\n“Shall we watch by the corpse?”\n“Of what use would it be? Shut the dungeon as if he were alive—that is all.”\nThen the steps retreated, and the voices died away in the distance; the noise of the door, with its creaking hinges and bolts ceased, and a silence more sombre than that of solitude ensued,—the silence of death, which was all-pervasive, and struck its icy chill to the very soul of Dantès.\nThen he raised the flag-stone cautiously with his head, and looked carefully around the chamber. It was empty, and Dantès emerged from the tunnel.",

Ratonneau and Pomègue are the nearest islands of all those that surround the Château d’If, but Ratonneau and Pomègue are inhabited, as is also the islet of Daume. Tiboulen and Lemaire were therefore the safest for Dantès’ venture. The islands of Tiboulen and Lemaire are a league from the Château d’If; Dantès, nevertheless, determined to make for them. But how could he find his way in the darkness of the night?\nAt this moment he saw the light of Planier, gleaming in front of him like a star. By leaving this light on the right, he kept the Island of Tiboulen a little on the left; by turning to the left, therefore, he would find it. But, as we have said, it was at least a league from the Château d’If to this island. Often in prison Faria had said to him, when he saw him idle and inactive:\n“Dantès, you must not give way to this listlessness; you will be drowned if you seek to escape, and your strength has not been properly exercised and prepared for exertion.”\nThese words rang in Dantès’ ears, even beneath the waves; he hastened to cleave his way through them to see if he had not lost his strength. He found with pleasure that his captivity had taken away nothing of his power, and that he was still master of that element on whose bosom he had so often sported as a boy.\nFear, that relentless pursuer, clogged Dantès’ efforts. He listened for any sound that might be audible, and every time that he rose to the top of a wave he scanned the horizon, and strove to penetrate the darkness. He fancied that every wave behind him was a pursuing boat, and he redoubled his exertions, increasing rapidly his distance from the château, but exhausting his strength. He swam on still, and already the terrible château had disappeared in the darkness. He could not see it, but he felt its presence.\nAn hour passed, during which Dantès, excited by the feeling of freedom, continued to cleave the waves.\n“Let us see,” said he, “I have swum above an hour, but as the wind is against me, that has retarded my speed; however, if I am not mistaken, I must be close to Tiboulen. But what if I were mistaken?”\nA shudder passed over him. He sought to tread water, in order to rest himself; but the sea was too violent, and he felt that he could not make use of this means of recuperation.\n“Well,” said he, “I will swim on until I am worn out, or the cramp seizes me, and then I shall sink;” and he struck out with the energy of despair.\nSuddenly the sky seemed to him to become still darker and more dense, and heavy clouds seemed to sweep down towards him; at the same time he felt a sharp pain in his knee. He fancied for a moment that he had been shot, and listened for the report; but he heard nothing. Then he put out his hand, and encountered an obstacle and with another stroke knew that he had gained the shore.\nBefore him rose a grotesque mass of rocks, that resembled nothing so much as a vast fire petrified at the moment of its most fervent combustion. It was the Island of Tiboulen. Dantès rose, advanced a few steps, and, with a fervent prayer of gratitude, stretched himself on the granite, which seemed to him softer than down. Then, in spite of the wind and rain, he fell into the deep, sweet sleep of utter exhaustion.",

A beacon of hope shone in the distance: the Planier lighthouse. He resolved to steer by its light to reach Tiboulen.\\n\\nAs he prepared for the arduous swim, the words of the wise Abbé Faria echoed in his mind, a stark reminder of the physical toll his long imprisonment had taken and the necessity of preserving his strength. He tested himself, striking out in the water, and a wave of relief washed over him as he found his limbs had not lost their power. His long captivity had not broken his swimmer's spirit.\\n\\nYet, fear was a relentless pursuer. With every stroke, he imagined the sounds of a patrol boat, the shouts of guards. Each time he surfaced for air, his eyes darted through the darkness, searching for any sign of pursuit. He swam on, a machine of desperation, until at last, the formidable silhouette of the Château d’If disappeared behind him. The stone prison was gone from his sight, but he could still feel its oppressive weight on his soul.\\n\\nAn hour passed. The wind rose, pushing against him, slowing his progress. He must be near Tiboulen, he thought, but a cold shudder of doubt seized him. The sea grew more violent, making it impossible to rest by treading water. There was no choice but to swim on until exhaustion claimed him, until a cramp paralyzed him and sent him to the depths. Just as he resigned himself to this fate, the sky seemed to grow darker still. A sudden, sharp pain shot through his knee. He had been shot! The patrol had found him. But the pain was followed not by the sting of a bullet, but by the grating scrape of rock. He had not been shot; he had reached land.\\n\\nHe clung to the grotesque mass of granite, recognizing it as the Island of Tiboulen.

Then he advanced; but before they could meet, the vessel again changed her course. By a violent effort he rose half out of the water, waving his cap, and uttering a loud shout peculiar to sailors. This time he was both seen and heard, and the tartan instantly steered towards him. At the same time, he saw they were about to lower the boat.\nAn instant after, the boat, rowed by two men, advanced rapidly towards him. Dantès let go of the timber, which he now thought to be useless, and swam vigorously to meet them. But he had reckoned too much upon his strength, and then he realized how serviceable the timber had been to him. His arms became stiff, his legs lost their flexibility, and he was almost breathless.\nHe shouted again. The two sailors redoubled their efforts, and one of them cried in Italian, “Courage!”\nThe word reached his ear as a wave which he no longer had the strength to surmount passed over his head. He rose again to the surface, struggled with the last desperate effort of a drowning man, uttered a third cry, and felt himself sinking, as if the fatal cannon shot were again tied to his feet. The water passed over his head, and the sky turned gray. A convulsive movement again brought him to the surface. He felt himself seized by the hair, then he saw and heard nothing. He had fainted.",

Before he could speak, a flask of rum was pressed to his lips, and the fiery liquid sent a shock of warmth through his chilled body. “Drink, brother,” a gruff voice said in Italian. “You’ve had a close call with the sea.”\n\nDantès sat up, his muscles aching from the cold and exertion. He looked at his saviors—smugglers, by their rough attire and the swift, practiced way they handled the vessel. He needed a story, and quickly. His mind, sharpened by years of solitude and thought, worked with incredible speed. “Where am I?” he asked, his voice hoarse.\n\n“Aboard the Jeune-Amélie, bound for Leghorn,” replied the man who seemed to be the captain, a Genoese named Gaetano. “We fished you out of the water near the Isle of Tiboulen. What ship were you on?”\n\n“She was the Pharaon,” Dantès said, choosing the name of his old, beloved ship, but altering the details. “A Maltese merchantman. We were caught in the squall last night and went down. I believe I am the only survivor.” He cast his eyes down, feigning a grief that was, in its own way, entirely real—grief for the life that had been stolen from him.\n\nThe sailors exchanged glances. A shipwreck was a common enough tragedy. They offered him dry clothes and a piece of bread, which he devoured with a hunger he hadn't felt in fourteen years. The captain, observing his lean but powerful frame and the intelligent look in his eyes, saw a capable seaman, not a fugitive. “You can work your passage to Leghorn if you like,” Gaetano offered. “We can always use another hand.”\n\nDantès nodded, his heart swelling with a profound sense of deliverance. “I am at your service,” he said. “And I am grateful.” As the tartan cut through the blue Mediterranean waves, he looked back. In the distance, the grim silhouette of the Château d'If faded into the horizon, a tomb he had miraculously escaped. A new life had begun."

Jacopo dived into the hold and soon returned with what Edmond wanted.\n“Now, then, do you wish for anything else?” said the patron.\n“A piece of bread and another glass of the capital rum I tasted, for I have not eaten or drunk for a long time.” He had not tasted food for forty hours. A piece of bread was brought, and Jacopo offered him the gourd.\n“Larboard your helm,” cried the captain to the steersman. Dantès glanced that way as he lifted the gourd to his mouth; then paused with hand in mid-air.\n“Hollo! what’s the matter at the Château d’If?” said the captain.\nA small white cloud, which had attracted Dantès’ attention, crowned the summit of the bastion of the Château d’If. At the same moment the faint report of a gun was heard. The sailors looked at one another.\n“What is this?” asked the captain.\n“A prisoner has escaped from the Château d’If, and they are firing the alarm gun,” replied Dantès. The captain glanced at him, but he had lifted the rum to his lips and was drinking it with so much composure, that suspicions, if the captain had any, died away.\n“Pretty strong rum!” said Dantès, wiping his brow with his sleeve.\n“At any rate,” murmured he, “if it be, so much the better, for I have made a rare acquisition.”\nUnder pretence of being fatigued, Dantès asked to take the helm; the steersman, glad to be relieved, looked at the captain, and the latter by a sign indicated that he might abandon it to his new comrade. Dantès could thus keep his eyes on Marseilles.\n“What is the day of the month?” asked he of Jacopo, who sat down beside him.\n“The 28th of February.”\n“In what year?”\n“In what year—you ask me in what year?”\n“Yes,” replied the young man, “I ask you in what year!”\n“You have forgotten then?”\n“I got such a fright last night,” replied Dantès, smiling, “that I have almost lost my memory. I ask you what year is it?”\n“The year 1829,” returned Jacopo.\nIt was fourteen years, day for day, since Dantès’ arrest. He was nineteen when he entered the Château d’If; he was thirty-three when he escaped. A sorrowful smile passed over his face; he asked himself what had become of Mercédès, who must believe him dead. Then his eyes lighted up with hatred as he thought of the three men who had caused him so long and wretched a captivity. He renewed against Danglars, Fernand, and Villefort the oath of implacable vengeance he had made in his dungeon.\nThis oath was no longer a vain menace; for the fastest sailor in the Mediterranean would have been unable to overtake the little tartan, that with every stitch of canvas set was flying before the wind to Leghorn.",

          "text_segment": "Dantès had not been a day on board before he had a very clear idea of the men with whom his lot had been cast. Without having been in the school of the Abbé Faria, the worthy master of La Jeune Amélie (the name of the Genoese tartan) knew a smattering of all the tongues spoken on the shores of that large lake called the Mediterranean, from the Arabic to the Provençal, and this, while it spared him interpreters, persons always troublesome and frequently indiscreet, gave him great facilities of communication, either with the vessels he met at sea, with the small boats sailing along the coast, or with the people without name, country, or occupation, who are always seen on the quays of seaports, and who live by hidden and mysterious means which we must suppose to be a direct gift of Providence, as they have no visible means of support. It is fair to assume that Dantès was on board a smuggler.\nAt first the captain had received Dantès on board with a certain degree of distrust. He was very well known to the customs officers of the coast; and as there was between these worthies and himself a perpetual battle of wits, he had at first thought that Dantès might be an emissary of these industrious guardians of rights and duties, who perhaps employed this ingenious means of learning some of the secrets of his trade. But the skilful manner in which Dantès had handled the lugger had entirely reassured him; and then, when he saw the light plume of smoke floating above the bastion of the Château d’If, and heard the distant report, he was instantly struck with the idea that he had on board his vessel one whose coming and going, like that of kings, was accompanied with salutes of artillery. This made him less uneasy, it must be owned, than if the new-comer had proved to be a customs officer; but this supposition also disappeared like the first, when he beheld the perfect tranquillity of his recruit.\nEdmond thus had the advantage of knowing what the owner was, without the owner knowing who he was; and however the old sailor and his crew tried to “pump” him, they extracted nothing more from him; he gave accurate descriptions of Naples and Malta, which he knew as well as Marseilles, and held stoutly to his first story. Thus the Genoese, subtle as he was, was duped by Edmond, in whose favor his mild demeanor, his nautical skill, and his admirable dissimulation, pleaded. Moreover, it is possible that the Genoese was one of those shrewd persons who know nothing but what they should know, and believe nothing but what they should believe.",

But the skill with which Dantès managed the vessel had given him a universally acknowledged superiority, and the captain was now convinced that he was a skillful mariner, who had for some reason incurred the anger of the government. The gentle manners of Dantès, his knowledge of seamanship, and his cleverness in baffling the questions of the crew, who were anxious to know who he was and whence he came, gave him a certain ascendancy over them all. He said he was a Maltese, and he accounted for his being found on the island of Monte Cristo by pretending that he had been shipwrecked. His familiarity with Naples and Malta, which he had often visited, gave a great air of reality to his story, and the Genoese captain, who was a shrewd fellow, was, or appeared to be, completely the dupe of his new sailor.

Here Edmond was to undergo another trial; he was to find out whether he could recognize himself, as he had not seen his own face for fourteen years. He had preserved a tolerably good remembrance of what the youth had been, and was now to find out what the man had become. His comrades believed that his vow was fulfilled. As he had twenty times touched at Leghorn, he remembered a barber in St. Ferdinand Street; he went there to have his beard and hair cut. The barber gazed in amazement at this man with the long, thick and black hair and beard, which gave his head the appearance of one of Titian’s portraits. At this period it was not the fashion to wear so large a beard and hair so long; now a barber would only be surprised if a man gifted with such advantages should consent voluntarily to deprive himself of them. The Leghorn barber said nothing and went to work.\nWhen the operation was concluded, and Edmond felt that his chin was completely smooth, and his hair reduced to its usual length, he asked for a looking-glass. He was now, as we have said, three-and-thirty years of age, and his fourteen years’ imprisonment had produced a great transformation in his appearance.\nDantès had entered the Château d’If with the round, open, smiling face of a young and happy man, with whom the early paths of life have been smooth, and who anticipates a future corresponding with his past. This was now all changed. The oval face was lengthened, his smiling mouth had assumed the firm and marked lines which betoken resolution; his eyebrows were arched beneath a brow furrowed with thought; his eyes were full of melancholy, and from their depths occasionally sparkled gloomy fires of misanthropy and hatred; his complexion, so long kept from the sun, had now that pale color which produces, when the features are encircled with black hair, the aristocratic beauty of the man of the north; the profound learning he had acquired had besides diffused over his features a refined intellectual expression; and he had also acquired, being naturally of a goodly stature, that vigor which a frame possesses which has so long concentrated all its force within itself.\nTo the elegance of a nervous and slight form had succeeded the solidity of a rounded and muscular figure. As to his voice, prayers, sobs, and imprecations had changed it so that at times it was of a singularly penetrating sweetness, and at others rough and almost hoarse.\nMoreover, from being so long in twilight or darkness, his eyes had acquired the faculty of distinguishing objects in the night, common to the hyena and the wolf. Edmond smiled when he beheld himself; it was impossible that his best friend—if, indeed, he had any friend left—could recognize him; he could not recognize himself.\n",

His brow was furrowed with wrinkles, and his eyes, which had been so soft and limpid, were now full of a sad and melancholy expression, from which, at times, there darted a gleam of misanthropy and of hatred. His complexion, so long kept from the sun, had now that pale and delicate look which is so much admired in the North, and which gives such an aristocratic air to the features.

Dantès, who had entered the Château d'If with the round, open, smiling face of a young and happy man, with whom the early paths of life have been smooth, and who looks upon the world as a vast field for his hopes, had now a face lengthened by sorrow. The bold and free gaze of the young man was replaced by a look of deep thoughtfulness, and his mouth, which had been half-opened to give vent to his mirthful thoughts, was now compressed into an expression of resolute and unflinching determination. His brow was furrowed with wrinkles, and his eyes, which had been so soft and limpid, were now full of a sad and melancholy expression, from which, at times, there darted a gleam of misanthropy and of hatred. His complexion, so long kept from the sun, had now that pale and delicate look which is so much admired in the North, and which gives such an aristocratic air to the features.

But then what could he do without instruments to discover his treasure, without arms to defend himself? Besides, what would the sailors say? What would the patron think? He must wait.\nFortunately, Dantès had learned how to wait; he had waited fourteen years for his liberty, and now he was free he could wait at least six months or a year for wealth. Would he not have accepted liberty without riches if it had been offered to him? Besides, were not those riches chimerical?—offspring of the brain of the poor Abbé Faria, had they not died with him?

But this sufficed for Jacopo, who instinctively felt that Edmond had a right to superiority of position—a superiority which Edmond had concealed from all others. And from this time the kindness which Edmond showed him was enough for the brave seaman.\nThen in the long days on board ship, when the vessel, gliding on with security over the azure sea, required no care but the hand of the helmsman, thanks to the favorable winds that swelled her sails, Edmond, with a chart in his hand, became the instructor of Jacopo, as the poor Abbé Faria had been his tutor. He pointed out to him the bearings of the coast, explained to him the variations of the compass, and taught him to read in that vast book opened over our heads which they call heaven, and where God writes in azure with letters of diamonds.\nAnd when Jacopo inquired of him, “What is the use of teaching all these things to a poor sailor like me?” Edmond replied, “Who knows?

He knelt by the still form, wiping the sea-salt from the pale face with his own rough sleeve. 'He may yet live, Captain,' he pleaded, his voice thick with an emotion that surprised his comrades. 'We cannot abandon a Christian soul on this desolate rock.' The captain scoffed, his eyes scanning the horizon for any unwelcome sails. 'He is as good as dead. We will leave him his share of provisions and a flask of wine. It is more than he could expect.' Reluctantly, the crew followed their captain's orders, depositing the motionless body in a sheltered grotto. As the Jeune-Amélie pulled away from the shore, Jacopo remained at the rail, his gaze fixed on the island until it was but a speck in the vast, indifferent sea. Dantès, his eyes barely open, watched him go.

Already Dantès had visited this maritime Bourse two or three times, and seeing all these hardy free-traders, who supplied the whole coast for nearly two hundred leagues in extent, he had asked himself what power might not that man attain who should give the impulse of his will to all these contrary and diverging minds. This time it was a great matter that was under discussion, connected with a vessel laden with Turkey carpets, stuffs of the Levant, and cashmeres. It was necessary to find some neutral ground on which an exchange could be made, and then to try and land these goods on the coast of France. If the venture was successful the profit would be enormous, there would be a gain of fifty or sixty piastres each for the crew.\nThe patron of La Jeune Amélie proposed as a place of landing the Island of Monte Cristo, which being completely deserted, and having neither soldiers nor revenue officers, seemed to have been placed in the midst of the ocean since the time of the heathen Olympus by Mercury, the god of merchants and robbers, classes of mankind which we in modern times have separated if not made distinct, but which antiquity appears to have included in the same category.\nAt the mention of Monte Cristo Dantès started with joy; he rose to conceal his emotion, and took a turn around the smoky tavern, where all the languages of the known world were jumbled in a lingua franca.\nWhen he again joined the two persons who had been discussing the matter, it had been decided that they should touch at Monte Cristo and set out on the following night. Edmond, being consulted, was of opinion that the island afforded every possible security, and that great enterprises to be well done should be done quickly.\nNothing then was altered in the plan, and orders were given to get under weigh next night, and, wind and weather permitting, to make the neutral island by the following day.",

One night more and he would be on his way.\nThe night was one of feverish distraction, and in its progress visions, good and evil, passed through Dantès’ mind. If he closed his eyes, he saw Cardinal Spada’s letter written on the wall in characters of flame—if he slept for a moment the wildest dreams haunted his brain. He ascended into grottos paved with emeralds, with panels of rubies, and the roof glowing with diamond stalactites. Pearls fell drop by drop, as subterranean waters filter in their caves. Edmond, amazed, wonderstruck, filled his pockets with the radiant gems and then returned to daylight, when he discovered that his prizes had all changed into common pebbles. He then endeavored to re-enter the marvellous grottos, but they had suddenly receded, and now the path became a labyrinth, and then the entrance vanished, and in vain did he tax his memory for the magic and mysterious word which opened the splendid caverns of Ali Baba to the Arabian fisherman. All was useless, the treasure disappeared, and had again reverted to the genii from whom for a moment he had hoped to carry it off.\nThe day came at length, and was almost as feverish as the night had been, but it brought reason to the aid of imagination, and Dantès was then enabled to arrange a plan which had hitherto been vague and unsettled in his brain. Night came, and with it the preparation for departure, and these preparations served to conceal Dantès’ agitation. He had by degrees assumed such authority over his companions that he was almost like a commander on board; and as his orders were always clear, distinct, and easy of execution, his comrades obeyed him with celerity and pleasure.\nThe old patron did not interfere, for he too had recognized the superiority of Dantès over the crew and himself. He saw in the young man his natural successor, and regretted that he had not a daughter, that he might have bound Edmond to him by a more secure alliance. At seven o’clock in the evening all was ready, and at ten minutes past seven they doubled the lighthouse just as the beacon was kindled. The sea was calm, and, with a fresh breeze from the south-east, they sailed beneath a bright blue sky, in which God also lighted up in turn his beacon lights, each of which is a world. Dantès told them that all hands might turn in, and he would take the helm. When the Maltese (for so they called Dantès) had said this, it was sufficient, and all went to their bunks contentedly.\nThis frequently happened. Dantès, cast from solitude into the world, frequently experienced an imperious desire for solitude; and what solitude is more complete, or more poetical, than that of a ship floating in isolation on the sea during the obscurity of the night, in the silence of immensity, and under the eye of Heaven?",

They were just abreast of Mareciana, and beyond the flat but verdant Island of La Pianosa. The peak of Monte Cristo reddened by the burning sun, was seen against the azure sky. Dantès ordered the helmsman to put down his helm, in order to leave La Pianosa to starboard, as he knew that he should shorten his course by two or three knots. About five o’clock in the evening the island was distinct, and everything on it was plainly perceptible, owing to that clearness of the atmosphere peculiar to the light which the rays of the sun cast at its setting.\nEdmond gazed very earnestly at the mass of rocks which gave out all the variety of twilight colors, from the brightest pink to the deepest blue; and from time to time his cheeks flushed, his brow darkened, and a mist passed over his eyes.

In spite of his usual command over himself, Dantès could not restrain his impetuosity. He was the first to jump on shore; and had he dared, he would, like Lucius Brutus, have “kissed his mother earth.” It was dark, but at eleven o’clock the moon rose in the midst of the ocean, whose every wave she silvered, and then, “ascending high,” played in floods of pale light on the rocky hills of this second Pelion.\nThe island was familiar to the crew of La Jeune Amélie,—it was one of her regular haunts. As to Dantès, he had passed it on his voyage to and from the Levant, but never touched at it. He questioned Jacopo.\n“Where shall we pass the night?” he inquired.\n“Why, on board the tartan,” replied the sailor.\n“Should we not do better in the grottos?”\n“What grottos?”\n“Why, the grottos—caves of the island.”\n“I do not know of any grottos,” replied Jacopo.\nThe cold sweat sprang forth on Dantès’ brow.\n“What, are there no grottos at Monte Cristo?” he asked.\n“None.”\nFor a moment Dantès was speechless; then he remembered that these caves might have been filled up by some accident, or even stopped up, for the sake of greater security, by Cardinal Spada. The point was, then, to discover the hidden entrance. It was useless to search at night, and Dantès therefore delayed all investigation until the morning. Besides, a signal made half a league out at sea, and to which La Jeune Amélie replied by a similar signal, indicated that the moment for business had come.\nThe boat that now arrived, assured by the answering signal that all was well, soon came in sight, white and silent as a phantom, and cast anchor within a cable’s length of shore.",

The cause was not in Dantès, but in Providence, who, while limiting the power of man, has filled him with boundless desires.\nMeanwhile, by a cleft between two walls of rock, following a path worn by a torrent, and which, in all human probability, human foot had never before trod, Dantès approached the spot where he supposed the grottos must have existed. Keeping along the shore, and examining the smallest object with serious attention, he thought he could trace, on certain rocks, marks made by the hand of man.\nTime, which encrusts all physical substances with its mossy mantle, as it invests all things of the mind with forgetfulness, seemed to have respected these signs, which apparently had been made with some degree of regularity, and probably with a definite purpose. Occasionally the marks were hidden under tufts of myrtle, which spread into large bushes laden with blossoms, or beneath parasitical lichen. So Edmond had to separate the branches or brush away the moss to know where the guide-marks were. The sight of marks renewed Edmond fondest hopes. Might it not have been the cardinal himself who had first traced them, in order that they might serve as a guide for his nephew in the event of a catastrophe, which he could not foresee would have been so complete. This solitary place was precisely suited to the requirements of a man desirous of burying treasure. Only, might not these betraying marks have attracted other eyes than those for whom they were made? and had the dark and wondrous island indeed faithfully guarded its precious secret?\nIt seemed, however, to Edmond, who was hidden from his comrades by the inequalities of the ground, that at sixty paces from the harbor the marks ceased; nor did they terminate at any grotto. A large round rock, placed solidly on its base, was the only spot to which they seemed to lead. Edmond concluded that perhaps instead of having reached the end of the route he had only explored its beginning, and he therefore turned round and retraced his steps.\nMeanwhile his comrades had prepared the repast, had got some water from a spring, spread out the fruit and bread, and cooked the kid. Just at the moment when they were taking the dainty animal from the spit, they saw Edmond springing with the boldness of a chamois from rock to rock, and they fired the signal agreed upon. The sportsman instantly changed his direction, and ran quickly towards them. But even while they watched his daring progress, Edmond’s foot slipped, and they saw him stagger on the edge of a rock and disappear. They all rushed towards him, for all loved Edmond in spite of his superiority; yet Jacopo reached him first.\nHe found Edmond lying prone, bleeding, and almost senseless.

They wished to carry him to the shore; but when they touched him, although under Jacopo’s directions, he declared, with heavy groans, that he could not bear to be moved.\nIt may be supposed that Dantès did not now think of his dinner, but he insisted that his comrades, who had not his reasons for fasting, should have their meal. As for himself, he declared that he had only need of a little rest, and that when they returned he should be easier. The sailors did not require much urging. They were hungry, and the smell of the roasted kid was very savory, and your tars are not very ceremonious. An hour afterwards they returned. All that Edmond had been able to do was to drag himself about a dozen paces forward to lean against a moss-grown rock.\nBut, instead of growing easier, Dantès’ pains appeared to increase in violence. The old patron, who was obliged to sail in the morning in order to land his cargo on the frontiers of Piedmont and France, between Nice and Fréjus, urged Dantès to try and rise. Edmond made great exertions in order to comply; but at each effort he fell back, moaning and turning pale.\n“He has broken his ribs,” said the commander, in a low voice. “No matter; he is an excellent fellow, and we must not leave him. We will try and carry him on board the tartan.”\nDantès declared, however, that he would rather die where he was than undergo the agony which the slightest movement cost him.\n“Well,” said the patron, “let what may happen, it shall never be said that we deserted a good comrade like you. We will not go till evening.”\nThis very much astonished the sailors, although, not one opposed it. The patron was so strict that this was the first time they had ever seen him give up an enterprise, or even delay in its execution. Dantès would not allow that any such infraction of regular and proper rules should be made in his favor.\n“No, no,” he said to the patron, “I was awkward, and it is just that I pay the penalty of my clumsiness. Leave me a small supply of biscuit, a gun, powder, and balls, to kill the kids or defend myself at need, and a pickaxe, that I may build a shelter if you delay in coming back for me.”\n“But you’ll die of hunger,” said the patron.\n“I would rather do so,” was Edmond’s reply, “than suffer the inexpressible agonies which the slightest movement causes me.”\nThe patron turned towards his vessel, which was rolling on the swell in the little harbor, and, with sails partly set, would be ready for sea when her toilet should be completed.\n“What are we to do, Maltese?” asked the captain. “We cannot leave you here so, and yet we cannot stay.”\n“Go, go!” exclaimed Dantès.\n“We shall be absent at least a week,” said the patron, “and then we must run out of our course to come here and take you up again.”\n“Why,” said Dantès, “if in two or three days you hail any fishing-boat, desire them to come here to me. I will pay twenty-five piastres for my passage back to Leghorn. If you do not come across one, return for me.” The patron shook his head.\n“Listen, Captain Baldi; there’s one way of settling this,” said Jacopo. “Do you go, and I will stay and take care of the wounded man.”\n“And give up your share of the venture,” said Edmond, “to remain with me?”\n“Yes,” said Jacopo, “and without any hesitation.”\n“You are a good fellow and a kind-hearted messmate,” replied Edmond, “and heaven will recompense you for your generous intentions; but I do not wish anyone to stay with me. A day or two of rest will set me up, and I hope I shall find among the rocks certain herbs most excellent for bruises.”\nA peculiar smile passed over Dantès’ lips; he squeezed Jacopo’s hand warmly, but nothing could shake his determination to remain—and remain alone.",

This creek was sufficiently wide at its mouth, and deep in the centre, to admit of the entrance of a small vessel of the lugger class, which would be perfectly concealed from observation.\nThen following the clew that, in the hands of the Abbé Faria, had been so skilfully used to guide him through the Dædalian labyrinth of probabilities, he thought that the Cardinal Spada, anxious not to be watched, had entered the creek, concealed his little barque, followed the line marked by the notches in the rock, and at the end of it had buried his treasure.

But how?\nHe cast his eyes around, and saw the horn full of powder which his friend Jacopo had left him. He smiled; the infernal invention would serve him for this purpose.\nWith the aid of his pickaxe, Dantès, after the manner of a labor-saving pioneer, dug a mine between the upper rock and the one that supported it, filled it with powder, then made a match by rolling his handkerchief in saltpetre.

Faria has dreamed this; the Cardinal Spada buried no treasure here; perhaps he never came here, or if he did, Cæsar Borgia, the intrepid adventurer, the stealthy and indefatigable plunderer, has followed him, discovered his traces, pursued them as I have done, raised the stone, and descending before me, has left me nothing.”\nHe remained motionless and pensive, his eyes fixed on the gloomy aperture that was open at his feet.\n“Now that I expect nothing, now that I no longer entertain the slightest hopes, the end of this adventure becomes simply a matter of curiosity.” And he remained again motionless and thoughtful.\n“Yes, yes; this is an adventure worthy a place in the varied career of that royal bandit. This fabulous event formed but a link in a long chain of marvels. Yes, Borgia has been here, a torch in one hand, a sword in the other, and within twenty paces, at the foot of this rock, perhaps two guards kept watch on land and sea, while their master descended, as I am about to descend, dispelling the darkness before his awe-inspiring progress.”\n“But what was the fate of the guards who thus possessed his secret?” asked Dantès of himself.\n“The fate,” replied he, smiling, “of those who buried Alaric, and were interred with the corpse.”\n“Yet, had he come,” thought Dantès, “he would have found the treasure, and Borgia, he who compared Italy to an artichoke, which he could devour leaf by leaf, knew too well the value of time to waste it in replacing this rock.",

The grotto was open, but the treasure might be gone. He hesitated to descend, reflecting on the pain of shattered hopes and his long acquaintance with adversity. What if the good Abbé had been mistaken? What if Cardinal Spada had never buried his treasure here? Or what if the cunning Cæsar Borgia, that master of secrets, had already discovered and plundered it? He stood pensively, staring into the dark opening, reframing the venture not as a certainty, but as a matter of curiosity. He pictured Borgia, torch in one hand, sword in the other, descending those very steps, and mused on the grim fate of any guards who knew his secret, sealed in death like those who buried the Gothic king Alaric.

He had only found the first grotto; he had now to seek the second. Dantès continued his search. He reflected that this second grotto must penetrate deeper into the island; he examined the stones, and sounded one part of the wall where he fancied the opening existed, masked for precaution’s sake.\nThe pickaxe struck for a moment with a dull sound that drew out of Dantès’ forehead large drops of perspiration. At last it seemed to him that one part of the wall gave forth a more hollow and deeper echo; he eagerly advanced, and with the quickness of perception that no one but a prisoner possesses, saw that there, in all probability, the opening must be.\nHowever, he, like Cæsar Borgia, knew the value of time; and, in order to avoid fruitless toil, he sounded all the other walls with his pickaxe, struck the earth with the butt of his gun, and finding nothing that appeared suspicious, returned to that part of the wall whence issued the consoling sound he had before heard.\nHe again struck it, and with greater force. Then a singular thing occurred. As he struck the wall, pieces of stucco similar to that used in the ground work of arabesques broke off, and fell to the ground in flakes, exposing a large white stone. The aperture of the rock had been closed with stones, then this stucco had been applied, and painted to imitate granite. Dantès struck with the sharp end of his pickaxe, which entered someway between the interstices.",

The aperture was already sufficiently large for him to enter, but by waiting, he could still cling to hope, and retard the certainty of deception. At last, after renewed hesitation, Dantès entered the second grotto.\nThe second grotto was lower and more gloomy than the first; the air that could only enter by the newly formed opening had the mephitic smell Dantès was surprised not to find in the outer cavern. He waited in order to allow pure air to displace the foul atmosphere, and then went on.\nAt the left of the opening was a dark and deep angle. But to Dantès’ eye there was no darkness. He glanced around this second grotto; it was, like the first, empty.\nThe treasure, if it existed, was buried in this corner. The time had at length arrived; two feet of earth removed, and Dantès’ fate would be decided.\nHe advanced towards the angle, and summoning all his resolution, attacked the ground with the pickaxe.

A wild goat had passed before the mouth of the cave, and was feeding at a little distance. This would have been a favorable occasion to secure his dinner; but Dantès feared lest the report of his gun should attract attention.\nHe thought a moment, cut a branch of a resinous tree, lighted it at the fire at which the smugglers had prepared their breakfast, and descended with this torch.\n",

Dantès, struck with the beauty and capability of the little vessel, applied to its owner to transfer it to him, offering sixty thousand francs, upon condition that he should be allowed to take immediate possession. The proposal was too advantageous to be refused, the more so as the person for whom the yacht was intended had gone upon a tour through Switzerland, and was not expected back in less than three weeks or a month, by which time the builder reckoned upon being able to complete another. A bargain was therefore struck. Dantès led the owner of the yacht to the dwelling of a Jew; retired with the latter for a few minutes to a small back parlor, and upon their return the Jew counted out to the shipbuilder the sum of sixty thousand francs in bright gold pieces.\nThe delighted builder then offered his services in providing a suitable crew for the little vessel, but this Dantès declined with many thanks, saying he was accustomed to cruise about quite alone, and his principal pleasure consisted in managing his yacht himself; the only thing the builder could oblige him in would be to contrive a sort of secret closet in the cabin at his bed’s head, the closet to contain three divisions, so constructed as to be concealed from all but himself. The builder cheerfully undertook the commission, and promised to have these secret places completed by the next day, Dantès furnishing the dimensions and plan in accordance with which they were to be constructed.",

I see that I have made a trifling mistake, as you say; but by way of rewarding your honesty I give you another double Napoleon, that you may drink to my health, and be able to ask your messmates to join you.”\nSo extreme was the surprise of the sailor, that he was unable even to thank Edmond, whose receding figure he continued to gaze after in speechless astonishment. “Some nabob from India,” was his comment.\nDantès, meanwhile, went on his way. Each step he trod oppressed his heart with fresh emotion; his first and most indelible recollections were there; not a tree, not a street, that he passed but seemed filled with dear and cherished memories. And thus he proceeded onwards till he arrived at the end of the Rue de Noailles, from whence a full view of the Allées de Meilhan was obtained. At this spot, so pregnant with fond and filial remembrances, his heart beat almost to bursting, his knees tottered under him, a mist floated over his sight, and had he not clung for support to one of the trees, he would inevitably have fallen to the ground and been crushed beneath the many vehicles continually passing there. Recovering himself, however, he wiped the perspiration from his brows, and stopped not again till he found himself at the door of the house in which his father had lived.\nThe nasturtiums and other plants, which his father had delighted to train before his window, had all disappeared from the upper part of the house.\nLeaning against the tree, he gazed thoughtfully for a time at the upper stories of the shabby little house. Then he advanced to the door, and asked whether there were any rooms to be let. Though answered in the negative, he begged so earnestly to be permitted to visit those on the fifth floor, that, in despite of the oft-repeated assurance of the concierge that they were occupied, Dantès succeeded in inducing the man to go up to the tenants, and ask permission for a gentleman to be allowed to look at them.\nThe tenants of the humble lodging were a young couple who had been scarcely married a week; and seeing them, Dantès sighed heavily. Nothing in the two small chambers forming the apartments remained as it had been in the time of the elder Dantès; the very paper was different, while the articles of antiquated furniture with which the rooms had been filled in Edmond’s time had all disappeared; the four walls alone remained as he had left them.\nThe bed belonging to the present occupants was placed as the former owner of the chamber had been accustomed to have his; and, in spite of his efforts to prevent it, the eyes of Edmond were suffused in tears as he reflected that on that spot the old man had breathed his last, vainly calling for his son.\nThe young couple gazed with astonishment at the sight of their visitor’s emotion, and wondered to see the large tears silently chasing each other down his otherwise stern and immovable features; but they felt the sacredness of his grief, and kindly refrained from questioning him as to its cause, while, with instinctive delicacy, they left him to indulge his sorrow alone.\nWhen he withdrew from the scene of his painful recollections, they both accompanied him downstairs, reiterating their hope that he would come again whenever he pleased, and assuring him that their poor dwelling would ever be open to him.\nAs Edmond passed the door on the fourth floor, he paused to inquire whether Caderousse the tailor still dwelt there; but he received for reply, that the person in question had got into difficulties, and at the present time kept a small inn on the route from Bellegarde to Beaucaire.",

This modern place of entertainment stood on the left-hand side of the post road, and backed upon the Rhône. It also boasted of what in Languedoc is styled a garden, consisting of a small plot of ground, on the side opposite to the main entrance reserved for the reception of guests. A few dingy olives and stunted fig-trees struggled hard for existence, but their withered dusty foliage abundantly proved how unequal was the conflict. Between these sickly shrubs grew a scanty supply of garlic, tomatoes, and eschalots; while, lone and solitary, like a forgotten sentinel, a tall pine raised its melancholy head in one of the corners of this unattractive spot, and displayed its flexible stem and fan-shaped summit dried and cracked by the fierce heat of the sub-tropical sun.\nAll these trees, great or small, were turned in the direction to which the Mistral blows, one of the three curses of Provence, the others being the Durance and the Parliament.\nIn the surrounding plain, which more resembled a dusty lake than solid ground, were scattered a few miserable stalks of wheat, the effect, no doubt, of a curious desire on the part of the agriculturists of the country to see whether such a thing as the raising of grain in those parched regions was practicable. Each stalk served as a perch for a grasshopper, which regaled the passers-by through this Egyptian scene with its strident, monotonous note.\nFor about seven or eight years the little tavern had been kept by a man and his wife, with two servants,—a chambermaid named Trinette, and a hostler called Pecaud. This small staff was quite equal to all the requirements, for a canal between Beaucaire and Aiguemortes had revolutionized transportation by substituting boats for the cart and the stagecoach. And, as though to add to the daily misery which this prosperous canal inflicted on the unfortunate innkeeper, whose utter ruin it was fast accomplishing, it was situated between the Rhône from which it had its source and the post-road it had depleted, not a hundred steps from the inn, of which we have given a brief but faithful description.\nThe innkeeper himself was a man of from forty to fifty-five years of age, tall, strong, and bony, a perfect specimen of the natives of those southern latitudes; he had dark, sparkling, and deep-set eyes, hooked nose, and teeth white as those of a carnivorous animal; his hair, like his beard, which he wore under his chin, was thick and curly, and in spite of his age but slightly interspersed with a few silvery threads. His naturally dark complexion had assumed a still further shade of brown from the habit the unfortunate man had acquired of stationing himself from morning till eve at the threshold of his door, on the lookout for guests who seldom came, yet there he stood, day after day, exposed to the meridional rays of a burning sun, with no other protection for his head than a red handkerchief twisted around it, after the manner of the Spanish muleteers. This man was our old acquaintance, Gaspard Caderousse.\nHis wife, on the contrary, whose maiden name had been Madeleine Radelle, was pale, meagre, and sickly-looking. Born in the neighborhood of Arles, she had shared in the beauty for which its women are proverbial; but that beauty had gradually withered beneath the devastating influence of the slow fever so prevalent among dwellers by the ponds of Aiguemortes and the marshes of Camargue. She remained nearly always in her second-floor chamber, shivering in her chair, or stretched languid and feeble on her bed, while her husband kept his daily watch at the door—a duty he performed with so much the greater willingness, as it saved him the necessity of listening to the endless plaints and murmurs of his helpmate, who never saw him without breaking out into bitter invectives against fate; to all of which her husband would calmly return an unvarying reply, in these philosophic words:\n“Hush, La Carconte. It is God’s pleasure that things should be so.”\nThe sobriquet of La Carconte had been bestowed on Madeleine Radelle from the fact that she had been born in a village, so called, situated between Salon and Lambesc; and as a custom existed among the inhabitants of that part of France where Caderousse lived of styling every person by some particular and distinctive appellation, her husband had bestowed on her the name of La Carconte in place of her sweet and euphonious name of Madeleine, which, in all probability, his rude gutteral language would not have enabled him to pronounce.\nStill, let it not be supposed that amid this affected resignation to the will of Providence, the unfortunate innkeeper did not writhe under the double misery of seeing the hateful canal carry off his customers and his profits, and the daily infliction of his peevish partner’s murmurs and lamentations.\nLike other dwellers in the south, he was a man of sober habits and moderate desires, but fond of external show, vain, and addicted to display. During the days of his prosperity, not a festivity took place without himself and wife being among the spectators. He dressed in the picturesque costume worn upon grand occasions by the inhabitants of the south of France, bearing equal resemblance to the style adopted both by the Catalans and Andalusians; while La Carconte displayed the charming fashion prevalent among the women of Arles, a mode of attire borrowed equally from Greece and Arabia. But, by degrees, watch-chains, necklaces, parti-colored scarves, embroidered bodices, velvet vests, elegantly worked stockings, striped gaiters, and silver buckles for the shoes, all disappeared; and Gaspard Caderousse, unable to appear abroad in his pristine splendor, had given up any further participation in the pomps and vanities, both for himself and wife, although a bitter feeling of envious discontent filled his mind as the sound of mirth and merry music from the joyous revellers reached even the miserable hostelry to which he still clung, more for the shelter than the profit it afforded.",

This modern place of entertainment was established on the ruins of a very ancient hostelry, which had in its time been a post-house of the Counts of Provence, and where, so runs the legend, the fair Maguelonne, secretly pursued by her lover, Pierre de Provence, after having witnessed the deaths of her three brothers, killed by him in a tournament, had stopped for rest and refreshment, on her way to the hermitage of Saint-Honorat, where she took the veil. The house was old and weather-beaten, and the sign, as we have before said, creaked in the wind, as if to implore the pity of the passers-by for the poor old ruin, which was about to fall. The building, though small, had a kind of rustic comfort about it. The travellers’ room was on the ground-floor, and was entered from the front door; a trellis-work of grape-vines and honeysuckles shaded the whole of the facade, and in the summer-time, when the sun was scorching, it was a pleasant retreat from its burning rays. But the inn had been built for other times than ours. The new canal from Beaucaire to Aigues-Mortes had proved a most successful speculation, and had transferred the transport of goods from the road to the water; and the poor inn, which had formerly been a source of profit and prosperity to its owners, was now barely able to pay its rates and taxes. For seven or eight years its occupants had been a man and his wife, named Caderousse. They had had a daughter, who had died of a fever, and a son, who had been drafted into the army. The man was about forty-five years of age, tall, strong, and bony, a true son of the south, with a swarthy complexion, black hair, and eyes which, in his moments of passion, sparkled and flashed like lightning. His wife, whose name was Madeleine Radelle, but who was more generally known as La Carconte (a name which she owed to the fact of her having been born in a village of that name, situated between Salon and Lambesc), was a woman of about the same age, pale, thin, and sickly. She was a native of the neighborhood of Arles, a place noted for the beauty of its women; but La Carconte had been an exception to the rule. She had been pretty once, but that was long ago; and now, soured by misfortune, and a prey to a constitutional nervous malady, she did nothing but grumble and complain from morning till night. She had two servants, a chambermaid named Trinette, and a hostler called Pecaud. But the inn was in such a bad way that the poor woman could not afford to pay them their wages, and they only remained with her from a feeling of charity, and in the hope of being paid when better times should come. Caderousse, on the contrary, was a man who was always in good spirits. He was a great talker, and was never at a loss for a joke or a story. He was a true Provençal, and, like all his countrymen, was a great boaster. He was, however, a good-hearted fellow, and would have done anything to serve a friend. His great fault was his love of money. He was always dreaming of making a fortune, and was constantly engaged in some speculation or other, which, as a rule, ended in his losing what little he had. Such was the man who, at the moment we introduce him to our readers, was standing in the doorway of his inn, with a pipe in his mouth, and a broad-brimmed straw hat on his head, looking out for the arrival of some chance customer. His wife was, as usual, in her own little room, which was situated at the back of the house, and from which she could hear all that was going on in the travellers’ room. It was the month of September, the time when the heat of the sun is most oppressive in the south of France. The dust lay thick on the road, and the leaves of the plane-trees which shaded the front of the inn were white with it. Not a breath of air was stirring, and the only sound that broke the silence was the chirping of the grasshoppers, which seemed to be trying to outvie each other in their shrill and monotonous song. Caderousse, who had been standing in the doorway for the last half-hour, had just come to the conclusion that he might as well go in and have a game of cards with his wife, when he heard the sound of a horse’s hoofs on the road. He looked up, and saw a horseman approaching at a rapid pace. The horse was a magnificent animal, and was covered with foam. The rider was a young man of about five-and-twenty, dressed in the height of fashion, and carrying a riding-whip in his hand. He pulled up his horse at the door of the inn, and, throwing the bridle to Caderousse, said, in a haughty tone, ‘A bottle of your best wine, and a feed of corn for my horse.’ Caderousse bowed, and, taking the horse by the bridle, led it to the stable.

There it lay stretching out into one interminable line of dust and sand, with its sides bordered by tall, meagre trees, altogether presenting so uninviting an appearance, that no one in his senses could have imagined that any traveller, at liberty to regulate his hours for journeying, would choose to expose himself in such a formidable Sahara.\nNevertheless, had Caderousse but retained his post a few minutes longer, he might have caught a dim outline of something approaching from the direction of Bellegarde; as the moving object drew nearer, he would easily have perceived that it consisted of a man and horse, between whom the kindest and most amiable understanding appeared to exist. The horse was of Hungarian breed, and ambled along at an easy pace. His rider was a priest, dressed in black, and wearing a three-cornered hat; and, spite of the ardent rays of a noonday sun, the pair came on with a fair degree of rapidity.\nHaving arrived before the Pont du Gard, the horse stopped, but whether for his own pleasure or that of his rider would have been difficult to say. However that might have been, the priest, dismounting, led his steed by the bridle in search of some place to which he could secure him. Availing himself of a handle that projected from a half-fallen door, he tied the animal safely and having drawn a red cotton handkerchief, from his pocket, wiped away the perspiration that streamed from his brow, then, advancing to the door, struck thrice with the end of his iron-shod stick.\nAt this unusual sound, a huge black dog came rushing to meet the daring assailant of his ordinarily tranquil abode, snarling and displaying his sharp white teeth with a determined hostility that abundantly proved how little he was accustomed to society. At that moment a heavy footstep was heard descending the wooden staircase that led from the upper floor, and, with many bows and courteous smiles, the host of the Pont du Gard besought his guest to enter.\n“You are welcome, sir, most welcome!” repeated the astonished Caderousse. “Now, then, Margotin,” cried he, speaking to the dog, “will you be quiet? Pray don’t heed him, sir!—he only barks, he never bites. I make no doubt a glass of good wine would be acceptable this dreadfully hot day.” Then perceiving for the first time the garb of the traveller he had to entertain, Caderousse hastily exclaimed: “A thousand pardons! I really did not observe whom I had the honor to receive under my poor roof. What would the abbé please to have? What refreshment can I offer? All I have is at his service.”",

Did I know poor dear Edmond? Why, Edmond Dantès and myself were intimate friends!” exclaimed Caderousse, whose countenance flushed darkly as he caught the penetrating gaze of the abbé fixed on him, while the clear, calm eye of the questioner seemed to dilate with feverish scrutiny.\n“You remind me,” said the priest, “that the young man concerning whom I asked you was said to bear the name of Edmond.”\n“Said to bear the name!” repeated Caderousse, becoming excited and eager. “Why, he was so called as truly as I myself bore the appellation of Gaspard Caderousse; but tell me, I pray, what has become of poor Edmond? Did you know him? Is he alive and at liberty? Is he prosperous and happy?”\n“He died a more wretched, hopeless, heart-broken prisoner than the felons who pay the penalty of their crimes at the galleys of Toulon.”\nA deadly pallor followed the flush on the countenance of Caderousse, who turned away, and the priest saw him wiping the tears from his eyes with the corner of the red handkerchief twisted round his head.\n“Poor fellow, poor fellow!” murmured Caderousse. “Well, there, sir, is another proof that good people are never rewarded on this earth, and that none but the wicked prosper. Ah,” continued Caderousse, speaking in the highly colored language of the South, “the world grows worse and worse. Why does not God, if he really hates the wicked, as he is said to do, send down brimstone and fire, and consume them altogether?”\n“You speak as though you had loved this young Dantès,” observed the abbé, without taking any notice of his companion’s vehemence.\n“And so I did,” replied Caderousse; “though once, I confess, I envied him his good fortune. But I swear to you, sir, I swear to you, by everything a man holds dear, I have, since then, deeply and sincerely lamented his unhappy fate.”\nThere was a brief silence, during which the fixed, searching eye of the abbé was employed in scrutinizing the agitated features of the innkeeper.\n“You knew the poor lad, then?” continued Caderousse.\n“I was called to see him on his dying bed, that I might administer to him the consolations of religion.”\n“And of what did he die?” asked Caderousse in a choking voice.\n“Of what, think you, do young and strong men die in prison, when they have scarcely numbered their thirtieth year, unless it be of imprisonment?” Caderousse wiped away the large beads of perspiration that gathered on his brow.\n“But the strangest part of the story is,” resumed the abbé, “that Dantès, even in his dying moments, swore by his crucified Redeemer, that he was utterly ignorant of the cause of his detention.”\n“And so he was,” murmured Caderousse. “How should he have been otherwise? Ah, sir, the poor fellow told you the truth.”\n“And for that reason, he besought me to try and clear up a mystery he had never been able to penetrate, and to clear his memory should any foul spot or stain have fallen on it.”\nAnd here the look of the abbé, becoming more and more fixed, seemed to rest with ill-concealed satisfaction on the gloomy depression which was rapidly spreading over the countenance of Caderousse.\n“A rich Englishman,” continued the abbé, “who had been his companion in misfortune, but had been released from prison during the second restoration, was possessed of a diamond of immense value; this jewel he bestowed on Dantès upon himself quitting the prison, as a mark of his gratitude for the kindness and brotherly care with which Dantès had nursed him in a severe illness he underwent during his confinement. Instead of employing this diamond in attempting to bribe his jailers, who might only have taken it and then betrayed him to the governor, Dantès carefully preserved it, that in the event of his getting out of prison he might have wherewithal to live, for the sale of such a diamond would have quite sufficed to make his fortune.”\n“Then, I suppose,” asked Caderousse, with eager, glowing looks, “that it was a stone of immense value?”\n“Why, everything is relative,” answered the abbé. “To one in Edmond’s position the diamond certainly was of great value. It was estimated at fifty thousand francs.”\n“Bless me!” exclaimed Caderousse, “fifty thousand francs! Surely the diamond was as large as a nut to be worth all that.”\n“No,” replied the abbé, “it was not of such a size as that; but you shall judge for yourself. I have it with me.”\nThe sharp gaze of Caderousse was instantly directed towards the priest’s garments, as though hoping to discover the location of the treasure. Calmly drawing forth from his pocket a small box covered with black shagreen, the abbé opened it, and displayed to the dazzled eyes of Caderousse the sparkling jewel it contained, set in a ring of admirable workmanship.\n“And that diamond,” cried Caderousse, almost breathless with eager admiration, “you say, is worth fifty thousand francs?”\n“It is, without the setting, which is also valuable,” replied the abbé, as he closed the box, and returned it to his pocket, while its brilliant hues seemed still to dance before the eyes of the fascinated innkeeper.",

MISSING ELEMENTS:\n- Early in the passage, the completion does not include the full extent of Caderousse's explanation regarding the old man's feelings and the context of his relationships with other characters.\n- The middle section lacks the exchange where the abbé presses Caderousse for details about Fernand's betrayal, and Caderousse's wife repeatedly warns him against speaking.\n- The latter part is missing the abbé's statements about the consequences of Caderousse's silence, the discussion about the intended reward, and the abbé's decision to fulfill his promise regardless of Caderousse's cooperation.\n- The final visual detail involving the diamond and Caderousse's reaction is not present.\n\n3. INACCURATE ELEMENTS:\n- There are inaccuracies in the way relationships and motivations are described, such as the oversimplification of Caderousse's feelings and the omission of his internal conflict.\n- The sequence of events is altered, with some dialogue condensed or rearranged, leading to a loss of the original's progression of tension and persuasion.\n- Some attributions of speech and actions are incorrect, such as Caderousse's response to his wife and the abbé's tone, which are not consistent with the original passage's structure.\n- The completion introduces a slightly different dynamic between Caderousse and his wife, which does not align with the original's portrayal of their interaction."

            "The woman exclaims at the magnificent jewel. Caderousse then asks if a fifth of the profits belongs to them.",
            "The abbé confirms this, adding that they would also receive an equal division of the elder Dantès's share, as he feels at liberty to divide it among the four survivors, assuming they are the friends Edmond esteemed most faithful.",
            "La Carconte murmurs that she doesn't consider those who betray and ruin you as friends. Caderousse quickly agrees, stating he had just observed to the gentleman that it's sacrilegious to reward treachery, perhaps crime.",
            "The abbé calmly replaces the jewel in his pocket, stating it is Caderousse's fault, not his, if he proceeds without full information. He then asks for the addresses of Fernand and Danglars to execute Edmond's wishes.",
            "Caderousse becomes extremely agitated. As the abbé rises and moves towards the door, as if to check on his horse, Caderousse and his wife exchange looks of deep meaning.",
            "Caderousse tells his wife that the splendid diamond might all be theirs if they chose. When she questions if he believes it, he asserts that a man of holy profession wouldn't deceive them.",
            "La Carconte replies for him to do as he likes, stating she washes her hands of the affair. She climbs the stairs to her chamber, body convulsed with chills despite the heat, and from the top stair, warns her husband to consider well what he is about to do.",

          "text_segment": "“Wife, wife!” cried he in a hoarse voice, “come here!”\n“Diamond!” exclaimed La Carconte, rising and descending to the chamber with a tolerably firm step; “what diamond are you talking about?”\n“Why, did you not hear all we said?” inquired Caderousse. “It is a beautiful diamond left by poor Edmond Dantès, to be sold, and the money divided between his father, Mercédès, his betrothed bride, Fernand, Danglars, and myself. The jewel is worth at least fifty thousand francs.”\n“Oh, what a magnificent jewel!” cried the astonished woman.\n“The fifth part of the profits from this stone belongs to us then, does it not?” asked Caderousse.\n“It does,” replied the abbé; “with the addition of an equal division of that part intended for the elder Dantès, which I believe myself at liberty to divide equally with the four survivors.”\n“And why among us four?” inquired Caderousse.\n“As being the friends Edmond esteemed most faithful and devoted to him.”\n“I don’t call those friends who betray and ruin you,” murmured the wife in her turn, in a low, muttering voice.\n“Of course not!” rejoined Caderousse quickly; “no more do I, and that was what I was observing to this gentleman just now. I said I looked upon it as a sacrilegious profanation to reward treachery, perhaps crime.”\n“Remember,” answered the abbé calmly, as he replaced the jewel and its case in the pocket of his cassock, “it is your fault, not mine, that I do so. You will have the goodness to furnish me with the address of both Fernand and Danglars, in order that I may execute Edmond’s last wishes.”\nThe agitation of Caderousse became extreme, and large drops of perspiration rolled from his heated brow. As he saw the abbé rise from his seat and go towards the door, as though to ascertain if his horse were sufficiently refreshed to continue his journey, Caderousse and his wife exchanged looks of deep meaning.\n“There, you see, wife,” said the former, “this splendid diamond might all be ours, if we chose!”\n“Do you believe it?”\n“Why, surely a man of his holy profession would not deceive us!”\n“Well,” replied La Carconte, “do as you like. For my part, I wash my hands of the affair.”\nSo saying, she once more climbed the staircase leading to her chamber, her body convulsed with chills, and her teeth rattling in her head, in spite of the intense heat of the weather. Arrived at the top stair, she turned round, and called out, in a warning tone, to her husband, “Gaspard, consider well what you are about to do!”\n“I have both reflected and decided,” answered he.\nLa Carconte then entered her chamber, the flooring of which creaked beneath her heavy, uncertain tread, as she proceeded towards her armchair, into which she fell as though exhausted.\n“Well,” asked the abbé, as he returned to the apartment below, “what have you made up your mind to do?”\n“To tell you all I know,” was the reply.\n“I certainly think you act wisely in so doing,” said the priest. “Not because I have the least desire to learn anything you may please to conceal from me, but simply that if, through your assistance, I could distribute the legacy according to the wishes of the testator, why, so much the better, that is all.”\n“I hope it may be so,” replied Caderousse, his face flushed with cupidity.\n“I am all attention,” said the abbé.\n“Stop a minute,” answered Caderousse; “we might be interrupted in the most interesting part of my story, which would be a pity; and it is as well that your visit hither should be made known only to ourselves.”\nWith these words he went stealthily to the door, which he closed, and, by way of still greater precaution, bolted and barred it, as he was accustomed to do at night.\nDuring this time the abbé had chosen his place for listening at his ease. He removed his seat into a corner of the room, where he himself would be in deep shadow, while the light would be fully thrown on the narrator; then, with head bent down and hands clasped, or rather clenched together, he prepared to give his whole attention to Caderousse, who seated himself on the little stool, exactly opposite to him.\n“Remember, this is no affair of mine,” said the trembling voice of La Carconte, as though through the flooring of her chamber she viewed the scene that was enacting below.\n“Enough, enough!” replied Caderousse; “say no more about it; I will take all the consequences upon myself.”\nAnd he began his story.",

            "One night, however, hearing the old man's sobs, Caderousse felt compelled to go to him, but found him praying with such eloquence and fervor that Caderousse, despite his own irreligious nature, was profoundly moved and reflected on the unbearable depth of a father's grief.",

Oh, yes; I can see it all before me this moment.”\n“Was it not his betrothal feast?”\n“It was and the feast that began so gayly had a very sorrowful ending; a police commissary, followed by four soldiers, entered, and Dantès was arrested.”\n“Yes, and up to this point I know all,” said the priest. “Dantès himself only knew that which personally concerned him, for he never beheld again the five persons I have named to you, or heard mention of anyone of them.”\n“Well, when Dantès was arrested, Monsieur Morrel hastened to obtain the particulars, and they were very sad. The old man returned alone to his home, folded up his wedding suit with tears in his eyes, and paced up and down his chamber the whole day, and would not go to bed at all, for I was underneath him and heard him walking the whole night; and for myself, I assure you I could not sleep either, for the grief of the poor father gave me great uneasiness, and every step he took went to my heart as really as if his foot had pressed against my breast.\n“The next day Mercédès came to implore the protection of M. de Villefort; she did not obtain it, however, and went to visit the old man; when she saw him so miserable and heart-broken, having passed a sleepless night, and not touched food since the previous day, she wished him to go with her that she might take care of him; but the old man would not consent. ‘No,’ was the old man’s reply, ‘I will not leave this house, for my poor dear boy loves me better than anything in the world; and if he gets out of prison he will come and see me the first thing, and what would he think if I did not wait here for him?’ I heard all this from the window, for I was anxious that Mercédès should persuade the old man to accompany her, for his footsteps over my head night and day did not leave me a moment’s repose.”\n“But did you not go upstairs and try to console the poor old man?” asked the abbé.\n“Ah, sir,” replied Caderousse, “we cannot console those who will not be consoled, and he was one of these; besides, I know not why, but he seemed to dislike seeing me. One night, however, I heard his sobs, and I could not resist my desire to go up to him, but when I reached his door he was no longer weeping but praying. I cannot now repeat to you, sir, all the eloquent words and imploring language he made use of; it was more than piety, it was more than grief, and I, who am no canter, and hate the Jesuits, said then to myself, ‘It is really well, and I am very glad that I have not any children; for if I were a father and felt such excessive grief as the old man does, and did not find in my memory or heart all he is now saying, I should throw myself into the sea at once, for I could not bear it.’”\n“Poor father!” murmured the priest.\n“From day to day he lived on alone, and more and more solitary. M. Morrel and Mercédès came to see him, but his door was closed; and, although I was certain he was at home, he would not make any answer. One day, when, contrary to his custom, he had admitted Mercédès, and the poor girl, in spite of her own grief and despair, endeavored to console him, he said to her,—‘Be assured, my dear daughter, he is dead; and instead of expecting him, it is he who is awaiting us; I am quite happy, for I am the oldest, and of course shall see him first.’\n“However well disposed a person may be, why, you see we leave off after a time seeing persons who are in sorrow, they make one melancholy; and so at last old Dantès was left all to himself, and I only saw from time to time strangers go up to him and come down again with some bundle they tried to hide; but I guessed what these bundles were, and that he sold by degrees what he had to pay for his subsistence. At length the poor old fellow reached the end of all he had; he owed three quarters’ rent, and they threatened to turn him out; he begged for another week, which was granted to him. I know this, because the landlord came into my apartment when he left his.\n“For the first three days I heard him walking about as usual, but, on the fourth I heard nothing. I then resolved to go up to him at all risks. The door was closed, but I looked through the keyhole, and saw him so pale and haggard, that believing him very ill, I went and told M. Morrel and then ran on to Mercédès. They both came immediately, M. Morrel bringing a doctor, and the doctor said it was inflammation of the bowels, and ordered him a limited diet. I was there, too, and I never shall forget the old man’s smile at this prescription.\n“From that time he received all who came; he had an excuse for not eating any more; the doctor had put him on a diet.”\nThe abbé uttered a kind of groan.\n“The story interests you, does it not, sir?” inquired Caderousse.\n“Yes,” replied the abbé, “it is very affecting.”\n“Mercédès came again, and she found him so altered that she was even more anxious than before to have him taken to her own home. This was M. Morrel’s wish also, who would fain have conveyed the old man against his consent; but the old man resisted, and cried so that they were actually frightened. Mercédès remained, therefore, by his bedside, and M. Morrel went away, making a sign to the Catalan that he had left his purse on the chimney-piece; but, availing himself of the doctor’s order, the old man would not take any sustenance; at length (after nine days of despair and fasting), the old man died, cursing those who had caused his misery, and saying to Mercédès, ‘If you ever see my Edmond again, tell him I die blessing him.’”",

She found him in his chamber, having thrown away the beautiful wedding suit he had bought. He had been up all night, and had not eaten. She begged him to come and live with her, that she might take care of him, but he would not consent.\\n\\n“‘No,’ he said, ‘I will not leave the house, for my poor boy loves me better than anything in the world, and if he gets out of prison he will come and see me the first thing, and I must be here to meet him.’ I heard all this from my window, for I was at it.\\n\\n“The days rolled on; but every morning I saw Mercédès come to the old man’s door, and every evening I saw her leave, sad and weeping. One day he would not see her, and shut the door on her. He told her, ‘It is not right that a young and beautiful girl should be with a man of my age.’ He was about sixty. What think you of that, Abbé?”\\n\\n“I think,” replied the abbé, “that he was right, and that he had a noble heart.”\\n\\n“And so the old man was left alone,” continued Caderousse. “Monsieur Morrel and Mercédès came from time to time, but his door was closed to them. One day, when Mercédès came, she found the door open. She heard a groan, and entered. The old man had fallen into a fit. She sent for a doctor. Monsieur Morrel came too, and we did all we could for the old man. But he was obstinate. After three days of hearing him walk, I heard nothing on the fourth. I went up. The door was locked, but by looking through the keyhole I saw him so pale and changed that I was sure he was dying. I told Monsieur Morrel, and he came at once. Mercédès was already there.\\n\\n“‘This is very affecting,’ said the abbé.\\n\\n“‘It is, indeed,’ said Caderousse. “Mercédès was beautiful, but her sorrow made her more so. The doctor came. He said the old man was suffering from an inflammation of the bowels, and ordered him a diet. I was there, and I shall never forget the old man’s smile at that prescription. From that moment, he would take nothing but what the doctor ordered. He had an excuse for dying of hunger. He had a holy pretext for suicide, you see. Mercédès stayed by his bedside. Monsieur Morrel left his purse on the mantelpiece, but the old man would not touch it. At last, after nine days of despair and abstinence, the old man died, cursing those who had caused his misery. He said to Mercédès, ‘If you ever see my Edmond, tell him I die blessing him.’”\"\n}\n```",
                "refinement_prompt": "IMPROVEMENT GUIDANCE:\n1. MAJOR STRUCTURAL ISSUES:\n- The completion omits the initial exchange where the abbé specifically requests to begin with Edmond's father, and Caderousse confirms the abbé's knowledge of earlier events. This introductory dialogue helps set the context and clarify the scope of the narrative.\n- The completion condenses or skips over the abbé's interjections and questions throughout the conversation, which in the original serve to guide and clarify the narrative.\n\n2. MISSING ELEMENTS:\n- The completion does not include the abbé's explicit statement about knowing everything up to Edmond's arrest, nor does it mention the five people Edmond never saw again, which is a key detail in the original.\n- The description of the old man's actions after returning home is missing some steps, such as the specific mention of folding up his wedding suit and the emotional impact this had on Caderousse.\n- The completion omits the detail about Caderousse hearing the old man walking all night and being unable to sleep himself due to the father's grief.\n- The original includes a window scene where Caderousse overhears the conversation between Mercédès and the old man, which is only briefly alluded to in the completion.\n- The completion does not mention the old man's specific refusal to leave his house, nor his reasoning about waiting for Edmond.\n- The narrative about Caderousse's attempt to console the old man and the old man's reaction is summarized, missing the nuance of the original exchange.\n- The completion omits the old man's words to Mercédès about being the oldest and expecting to see Edmond first, which is a significant emotional moment.\n- The process of the old man selling his possessions is summarized, but the original provides more detail about strangers coming and going with bundles.\n- The completion does not mention the landlord's involvement and the granting of an extra week, which is present in the original.\n- The sequence of events leading up to the discovery of the old man's illness is condensed, missing the detail of Caderousse listening for footsteps and the specific actions taken upon hearing silence.\n- The completion omits the abbé's emotional reactions and Caderousse's observations about the effect of grief on visitors.\n\n3. INACCURATE ELEMENTS:\n- The completion sometimes alters the sequence of events, such as when Mercédès stays by the old man's bedside before the doctor is called, whereas in the original, the order is more precise.\n- The completion attributes certain reflections and emotional insights to Caderousse that are more interpretive than in the original, introducing a more reflective tone that was not present.\n- The completion invents or exaggerates some emotional responses, such as describing the old man's pacing as \"the sound of a broken heart pacing its cage,\" which is not in the original.\n- The completion omits the abbé's groan and his statement about the story being affecting, which are important for conveying the emotional tone of the conversation.\n- The completion does not accurately represent the old man's final words and actions, summarizing them rather than presenting the sequence and content as in the original.\n\nOverall, the completion condenses and summarizes the narrative, omitting several key conversational exchanges, emotional details, and the precise sequence of events that are present in the original passage."

Morrel is utterly ruined; he has lost five ships in two years, has suffered by the bankruptcy of three large houses, and his only hope now is in that very Pharaon which poor Dantès commanded, and which is expected from the Indies with a cargo of cochineal and indigo. If this ship founders, like the others, he is a ruined man.”\n“And has the unfortunate man wife or children?” inquired the abbé.\n“Yes, he has a wife, who through everything has behaved like an angel; he has a daughter, who was about to marry the man she loved, but whose family now will not allow him to wed the daughter of a ruined man; he has, besides, a son, a lieutenant in the army; and, as you may suppose, all this, instead of lessening, only augments his sorrows.

During the war with Spain he was employed in the commissariat of the French army, and made a fortune; then with that money he speculated in the funds, and trebled or quadrupled his capital; and, having first married his banker’s daughter, who left him a widower, he has married a second time, a widow, a Madame de Nargonne, daughter of M. de Servieux, the king’s chamberlain, who is in high favor at court. He is a millionaire, and they have made him a baron, and now he is the Baron Danglars, with a fine residence in the Rue du Mont-Blanc, with ten horses in his stables, six footmen in his antechamber, and I know not how many millions in his strongbox.”\n“Ah!” said the abbé, in a peculiar tone, “he is happy.”\n“Happy? Who can answer for that? Happiness or unhappiness is the secret known but to one’s self and the walls—walls have ears but no tongue; but if a large fortune produces happiness, Danglars is happy.”\n“And Fernand?”\n“Fernand? Why, much the same story.”\n“But how could a poor Catalan fisher-boy, without education or resources, make a fortune? I confess this staggers me.”\n“And it has staggered everybody. There must have been in his life some strange secret that no one knows.”\n“But, then, by what visible steps has he attained this high fortune or high position?”\n“Both, sir—he has both fortune and position—both.”\n“This must be impossible!”\n“It would seem so; but listen, and you will understand. Some days before the return of the emperor, Fernand was drafted. The Bourbons left him quietly enough at the Catalans, but Napoleon returned, a special levy was made, and Fernand was compelled to join. I went too; but as I was older than Fernand, and had just married my poor wife, I was only sent to the coast. Fernand was enrolled in the active army, went to the frontier with his regiment, and was at the battle of Ligny. The night after that battle he was sentry at the door of a general who carried on a secret correspondence with the enemy. That same night the general was to go over to the English. He proposed to Fernand to accompany him; Fernand agreed to do so, deserted his post, and followed the general.\n“Fernand would have been court-martialed if Napoleon had remained on the throne, but his action was rewarded by the Bourbons. He returned to France with the epaulet of sub-lieutenant, and as the protection of the general, who is in the highest favor, was accorded to him, he was a captain in 1823, during the Spanish war—that is to say, at the time when Danglars made his early speculations. Fernand was a Spaniard, and being sent to Spain to ascertain the feeling of his fellow-countrymen, found Danglars there, got on very intimate terms with him, won over the support of the royalists at the capital and in the provinces, received promises and made pledges on his own part, guided his regiment by paths known to himself alone through the mountain gorges which were held by the royalists, and, in fact, rendered such services in this brief campaign that, after the taking of Trocadero, he was made colonel, and received the title of count and the cross of an officer of the Legion of Honor.”\n“Destiny! destiny!” murmured the abbé.\n“Yes, but listen: this was not all. The war with Spain being ended, Fernand’s career was checked by the long peace which seemed likely to endure throughout Europe. Greece only had risen against Turkey, and had begun her war of independence; all eyes were turned towards Athens—it was the fashion to pity and support the Greeks. The French government, without protecting them openly, as you know, gave countenance to volunteer assistance. Fernand sought and obtained leave to go and serve in Greece, still having his name kept on the army roll.\nSome time after, it was stated that the Comte de Morcerf (this was the name he bore) had entered the service of Ali Pasha with the rank of instructor-general. Ali Pasha was killed, as you know, but before he died he recompensed the services of Fernand by leaving him a considerable sum, with which he returned to France, when he was gazetted lieutenant-general.”\n“So that now——?” inquired the abbé.\n“So that now,” continued Caderousse, “he owns a magnificent house—No. 27, Rue du Helder, Paris.”",

But I have seen things so extraordinary, that what you tell me seems less astonishing than it otherwise might.”\n“Mercédès was at first in the deepest despair at the blow which deprived her of Edmond. I have told you of her attempts to propitiate M. de Villefort, her devotion to the elder Dantès. In the midst of her despair, a new affliction overtook her. This was the departure of Fernand—of Fernand, whose crime she did not know, and whom she regarded as her brother. Fernand went, and Mercédès remained alone.\n“Three months passed and still she wept—no news of Edmond, no news of Fernand, no companionship save that of an old man who was dying with despair. One evening, after a day of accustomed vigil at the angle of two roads leading to Marseilles from the Catalans, she returned to her home more depressed than ever. Suddenly she heard a step she knew, turned anxiously around, the door opened, and Fernand, dressed in the uniform of a sub-lieutenant, stood before her.\n“It was not the one she wished for most, but it seemed as if a part of her past life had returned to her.\n“Mercédès seized Fernand’s hands with a transport which he took for love, but which was only joy at being no longer alone in the world, and seeing at last a friend, after long hours of solitary sorrow. And then, it must be confessed, Fernand had never been hated—he was only not precisely loved. Another possessed all Mercédès’ heart; that other was absent, had disappeared, perhaps was dead. At this last thought Mercédès burst into a flood of tears, and wrung her hands in agony; but the thought, which she had always repelled before when it was suggested to her by another, came now in full force upon her mind; and then, too, old Dantès incessantly said to her, ‘Our Edmond is dead; if he were not, he would return to us.’\n“The old man died, as I have told you; had he lived, Mercédès, perchance, had not become the wife of another, for he would have been there to reproach her infidelity. Fernand saw this, and when he learned of the old man’s death he returned. He was now a lieutenant. At his first coming he had not said a word of love to Mercédès; at the second he reminded her that he loved her.\n“Mercédès begged for six months more in which to await and mourn for Edmond.”\n“So that,” said the abbé, with a bitter smile, “that makes eighteen months in all. What more could the most devoted lover desire?” Then he murmured the words of the English poet, “‘Frailty, thy name is woman.’”\n“Six months afterwards,” continued Caderousse, “the marriage took place in the church of Accoules.”\n“The very church in which she was to have married Edmond,” murmured the priest; “there was only a change of bridegrooms.”\n“Well, Mercédès was married,” proceeded Caderousse; “but although in the eyes of the world she appeared calm, she nearly fainted as she passed La Réserve, where, eighteen months before, the betrothal had been celebrated with him whom she might have known she still loved, had she looked to the bottom of her heart. Fernand, more happy, but not more at his ease—for I saw at this time he was in constant dread of Edmond’s return—Fernand was very anxious to get his wife away, and to depart himself. There were too many unpleasant possibilities associated with the Catalans, and eight days after the wedding they left Marseilles.”\n“Did you ever see Mercédès again?” inquired the priest.\n“Yes, during the Spanish war, at Perpignan, where Fernand had left her; she was attending to the education of her son.”\nThe abbé started. “Her son?” said he.\n“Yes,” replied Caderousse, “little Albert.”\n“But, then, to be able to instruct her child,” continued the abbé, “she must have received an education herself. I understood from Edmond that she was the daughter of a simple fisherman, beautiful but uneducated.”\n“Oh,” replied Caderousse, “did he know so little of his lovely betrothed? Mercédès might have been a queen, sir, if the crown were to be placed on the heads of the loveliest and most intelligent. Fernand’s fortune was already waxing great, and she developed with his growing fortune. She learned drawing, music—everything. Besides, I believe, between ourselves, she did this in order to distract her mind, that she might forget; and she only filled her head in order to alleviate the weight on her heart. But now her position in life is assured,” continued Caderousse; “no doubt fortune and honors have comforted her; she is rich, a countess, and yet——”\nCaderousse paused.\n“And yet what?” asked the abbé.\n“Yet, I am sure, she is not happy,” said Caderousse.",

So I went to Danglars, who would not even receive me. I called on Fernand, who sent me a hundred francs by his valet-de-chambre.”\n“Then you did not see either of them?”\n“No, but Madame de Morcerf saw me.”\n“How was that?”\n“As I went away a purse fell at my feet—it contained five-and-twenty louis; I raised my head quickly, and saw Mercédès, who at once shut the blind.”\n“And M. de Villefort?” asked the abbé.\n“Oh, he never was a friend of mine, I did not know him, and I had nothing to ask of him.”\n“Do you not know what became of him, and the share he had in Edmond’s misfortunes?”\n“No; I only know that some time after Edmond’s arrest, he married Mademoiselle de Saint-Méran, and soon after left Marseilles; no doubt he has been as lucky as the rest; no doubt he is as rich as Danglars, as high in station as Fernand. I only, as you see, have remained poor, wretched, and forgotten.”\n“You are mistaken, my friend,” replied the abbé; “God may seem sometimes to forget for a time, while his justice reposes, but there always comes a moment when he remembers—and behold—a proof!”\nAs he spoke, the abbé took the diamond from his pocket, and giving it to Caderousse, said, “Here, my friend, take this diamond, it is yours.”\n“What, for me only?” cried Caderousse, “ah, sir, do not jest with me!”\n“This diamond was to have been shared among his friends. Edmond had one friend only, and thus it cannot be divided. Take the diamond, then, and sell it; it is worth fifty thousand francs, and I repeat my wish that this sum may suffice to release you from your wretchedness.”\n“Oh, sir,” said Caderousse, putting out one hand timidly, and with the other wiping away the perspiration which bedewed his brow,—“Oh, sir, do not make a jest of the happiness or despair of a man.”\n“I know what happiness and what despair are, and I never make a jest of such feelings. Take it, then, but in exchange——”\nCaderousse, who touched the diamond, withdrew his hand.\nThe abbé smiled.\n“In exchange,” he continued, “give me the red silk purse that M. Morrel left on old Dantès’ chimney-piece, and which you tell me is still in your hands.”\nCaderousse, more and more astonished, went toward a large oaken cupboard, opened it, and gave the abbé a long purse of faded red silk, round which were two copper runners that had once been gilt. The abbé took it, and in return gave Caderousse the diamond.\n“Oh, you are a man of God, sir,” cried Caderousse; “for no one knew that Edmond had given you this diamond, and you might have kept it.”\n“Which,” said the abbé to himself, “you would have done.” The abbé rose, took his hat and gloves. “Well,” he said, “all you have told me is perfectly true, then, and I may believe it in every particular.”\n“See, sir,” replied Caderousse, “in this corner is a crucifix in holy wood—here on this shelf is my wife’s testament; open this book, and I will swear upon it with my hand on the crucifix. I will swear to you by my soul’s salvation, my faith as a Christian, I have told everything to you as it occurred, and as the recording angel will tell it to the ear of God at the day of the last judgment!”\n“’Tis well,” said the abbé, convinced by his manner and tone that Caderousse spoke the truth. “’Tis well, and may this money profit you! Adieu; I go far from men who thus so bitterly injure each other.”",

As I was leaving Fernand’s house, despondent, a window opened above. It was Madame de Morcerf. She saw me, and from her hand dropped a purse at my feet. It contained twenty-five louis.

                "refinement_prompt": "IMPROVEMENT GUIDANCE:\n1. MAJOR STRUCTURAL ISSUES:\n- The completion omits the entire exchange involving the red silk purse, which is a significant transactional moment in the original passage. The process of Caderousse retrieving and handing over the purse, and the abbé giving the diamond in return, is missing.\n- The completion does not include the concluding section where Caderousse swears to the truth of his story using the crucifix and his wife's testament, nor the abbé's final remarks and departure.\n\n2. MISSING ELEMENTS:\n- Early in the passage, the completion does not mention the specific sequence of Caderousse's attempts to see Danglars and Fernand, nor the detail that he did not see either of them directly.\n- The detail of the purse falling at Caderousse's feet and his immediate reaction is only partially represented; the completion lacks the nuance of how the purse was received and the immediate visual exchange with Mercédès.\n- The completion omits the abbé's request for the red silk purse and the description of Caderousse retrieving it from the cupboard.\n- The swearing on the crucifix and testament, and the invocation of the recording angel and the day of judgment, are not present.\n- The abbé's internal reflection about what Caderousse would have done with the diamond is missing.\n\n3. INACCURATE ELEMENTS:\n- The completion introduces invented details, such as specific titles and embellishments about the current status of Danglars and Fernand, and a reflection on Mercédès' happiness, which are not present in the original.\n- The sequence of events is altered: the discussion about Mercédès is prompted by the abbé in the completion, whereas in the original, Caderousse volunteers the information.\n- The description of the diamond is more elaborate in the completion than in the original, with added visual details not present in the source.\n- The completion ends abruptly, omitting the final exchange and resolution, and does not follow the original's closure."
