However, those experienced in navigation saw plainly that if any accident had occurred, it was not to the vessel herself, for she bore down with all the evidence of being skilfully handled, the anchor a-cockbill, the jib-boom guys already eased off, and standing by the side of the pilot, who was steering the Pharaon towards the narrow entrance of the inner port, was a young man, who, with activity and vigilant eye, watched every motion of the ship, and repeated each direction of the pilot.\nThe vague disquietude which prevailed among the spectators had so much affected one of the crowd that he did not await the arrival of the vessel in harbor, but jumping into a small skiff, desired to be pulled alongside the Pharaon, which he reached as she rounded into La Réserve basin.\nWhen the young man on board saw this person approach, he left his station by the pilot, and, hat in hand, leaned over the ship’s bulwarks.\nHe was a fine, tall, slim young fellow of eighteen or twenty, with black eyes, and hair as dark as a raven’s wing; and his whole appearance bespoke that calmness and resolution peculiar to men accustomed from their cradle to contend with danger.\n“Ah, is it you, Dantès?” cried the man in the skiff. “What’s the matter? and why have you such an air of sadness aboard?”\n“A great misfortune, M. Morrel,” replied the young man, “a great misfortune, for me especially! Off Civita Vecchia we lost our brave Captain Leclere.”\n“And the cargo?” inquired the owner, eagerly.\n“Is all safe, M. Morrel; and I think you will be satisfied on that head. But poor Captain Leclere——”\n“What happened to him?” asked the owner, with an air of considerable resignation. “What happened to the worthy captain?”\n“He died.”\n“Fell into the sea?”\n“No, sir, he died of brain-fever in dreadful agony.” Then turning to the crew, he said, “Bear a hand there, to take in sail!”\nAll hands obeyed, and at once the eight or ten seamen who composed the crew, sprang to their respective stations at the spanker brails and outhaul, topsail sheets and halyards, the jib downhaul, and the topsail clewlines and buntlines. The young sailor gave a look to see that his orders were promptly and accurately obeyed, and then turned again to the owner.\n“And how did this misfortune occur?” inquired the latter, resuming the interrupted conversation.\n“Alas, sir, in the most unexpected manner. After a long talk with the harbor-master, Captain Leclere left Naples greatly disturbed in mind. In twenty-four hours he was attacked by a fever, and died three days afterwards. We performed the usual burial service, and he is at his rest, sewn up in his hammock with a thirty-six-pound shot at his head and his heels, off El Giglio island. We bring to his widow his sword and cross of honor. It was worth while, truly,” added the young man with a melancholy smile, “to make war against the English for ten years, and to die in his bed at last, like everybody else.”",

A young man of four or five and twenty, with quick eyes and black hair, and of an intelligence and resolution which were readily discernible, exercised the functions of first mate, and was, moreover, the darling of the whole crew, by name Edmond Dantès. His father, a worthy old man, lived at the Alleys de Meilhan; and it was for the sole purpose of seeing this father that Edmond Dantès had obtained leave from M. Morrel to hasten on shore, leaving the supercargo of the Pharaon to attend to the customs and other formalities. But scarcely had the gangway been thrown on board when he was accosted by a man whom the sight of him appeared to excite to the most violent animosity. \"Ah, is it you, Edmond?\" said this man, with a voice in which the accents of envy were perceptible. \"Yes, Mercédès,\" replied the young man, \"and I am just arrived, as you see.\" \"And you are going to see your father, no doubt?\" said Mercédès. \"First, and then I shall go and see you, Mercédès.\" \"Go and see your father, Edmond,\" said Mercédès; \"he wants you.\" \"Yes, I know he does,\" replied Edmond; \"and I am going to see him, for I am a good son.\" \"And I am going to see you, Mercédès,\" said the young man, with a smile. \"Go, Edmond,\" said Mercédès; \"and do not forget that you are expected at my house.\" \"No, no,\" replied Edmond; \"I shall not forget it.\" And he sprang on shore, and disappeared in the crowd.

As usual, the pilot instantly put off, and the vessel was rapidly towed towards the entrance of the harbour amidst a crowd of spectators, whose curiosity is always greatly excited at Marseille by the arrival of a ship, especially when this ship, like the Pharaon, has been built, rigged, and laden at the old docks, and belongs to an owner of the city. The vessel entered the port, and cast anchor in the usual place. Immediately, the owner, Monsieur Morrel, hastened on board. He was accompanied by two persons, one of whom was the ship's supercargo, named Danglars, and the other, a man named Caderousse, a tailor by profession, and a neighbour of the elder Dantès. Monsieur Morrel's first question was to the captain. But a mournful answer awaited him. The captain, Leclère, was dead. He had died of brain fever during the voyage. Then, turning to the young man who stood beside him, with a calm face and a quick eye, and who seemed to be awaiting his orders, Monsieur Morrel recognized Edmond Dantès, the first mate. 'Ah, it is you, Edmond!' said he. 'What a misfortune! Poor Captain Leclère!' 'Yes, Monsieur Morrel,' replied Dantès, 'it was a sad event, which grieved us all deeply. He was a brave and honest man.' 'And you, Edmond, how did you manage to bring the vessel into port without a captain?' 'I took the command, sir, as was my duty,' said Dantès, 'and I hope I have fulfilled it to your satisfaction.' 'Perfectly, perfectly, my dear Edmond,' said Morrel. 'And I hear wonders of you from the crew. You handled the ship like a seasoned captain. This sad event may prove a fortunate one for you, young man. You were thinking of marrying, were you not, and of settling down?' 'Yes, Monsieur Morrel, as soon as I return from this voyage,' replied Dantès, a bright blush covering his face. 'Well, Edmond,' continued Morrel, 'I have a proposition to make to you. If you are willing to accept the post of captain of the Pharaon, I will appoint you at once. The salary is good, and with your diligence and honesty, you will soon make your fortune.' Dantès's eyes sparkled with joy and gratitude. 'Oh, Monsieur Morrel,' he exclaimed, 'you are too good! I accept with all my heart! It has been the dream of my life to command a ship for you!' 'You deserve it, Edmond. You are a worthy young man. Now, go and see your father, and your fiancée, Mercédès. They must be anxious to see you.' Dantès's heart swelled with happiness. He thanked Monsieur Morrel again and hurried ashore. As he passed the supercargo, Danglars, he noticed a dark look on his face, a look of envy and ill-will. Danglars, a man of about five-and-twenty, with a calculating mind and a cold heart, had hoped to succeed Leclère himself. He saw in Dantès a rival, not only in his professional ambitions but also, perhaps, in other matters. Caderousse, the tailor, a weak and drunken man, was easily influenced by Danglars. As Dantès rushed off, Danglars muttered to Caderousse, 'See how quickly he rises! Captain at twenty! If he continues like this, he will be a millionaire by thirty!' Caderousse grumbled in agreement, feeling a vague resentment towards Dantès's good fortune. Dantès, oblivious to the storm gathering behind him, thought only of his father and Mercédès. He ran through the bustling streets of Marseille, his sailor's gait quick and eager. The city, with its vibrant colours and lively crowds, seemed to share in"

He seized a rope which Dantès flung to him, and with an activity that would have done credit to a sailor, climbed up the side of the ship, while the young man, going to his task, left the conversation to Danglars, who now came towards the owner. He was a man of twenty-five or twenty-six years of age, of unprepossessing countenance, obsequious to his superiors, insolent to his subordinates; and this, in addition to his position as responsible agent on board, which is always obnoxious to the sailors, made him as much disliked by the crew as Edmond Dantès was beloved by them.\n“Well, M. Morrel,” said Danglars, “you have heard of the misfortune that has befallen us?”\n“Yes—yes: poor Captain Leclere! He was a brave and an honest man.”\n“And a first-rate seaman, one who had seen long and honorable service, as became a man charged with the interests of a house so important as that of Morrel & Son,” replied Danglars.\n“But,” replied the owner, glancing after Dantès, who was watching the anchoring of his vessel, “it seems to me that a sailor needs not be so old as you say, Danglars, to understand his business, for our friend Edmond seems to understand it thoroughly, and not to require instruction from anyone.”\n“Yes,” said Danglars, darting at Edmond a look gleaming with hate. “Yes, he is young, and youth is invariably self-confident. Scarcely was the captain’s breath out of his body when he assumed the command without consulting anyone, and he caused us to lose a day and a half at the Island of Elba, instead of making for Marseilles direct.”\n“As to taking command of the vessel,” replied Morrel, “that was his duty as captain’s mate; as to losing a day and a half off the Island of Elba, he was wrong, unless the vessel needed repairs.”\n“The vessel was in as good condition as I am, and as, I hope you are, M. Morrel, and this day and a half was lost from pure whim, for the pleasure of going ashore, and nothing else.”",

I believe, if she had not been laden, and I had been her master, he would have bought her. But I told him I was only mate, and that she belonged to the firm of Morrel & Son. ‘Ah, yes,’ he said, ‘I know them.

It will take quite six weeks to unload the cargo, and we cannot get you ready for sea until three months after that; only be back again in three months, for the Pharaon,” added the owner, patting the young sailor on the back, “cannot sail without her captain.”\n“Without her captain!” cried Dantès, his eyes sparkling with animation; “pray mind what you say, for you are touching on the most secret wishes of my heart. Is it really your intention to make me captain of the Pharaon?”\n“If I were sole owner we’d shake hands on it now, my dear Dantès, and call it settled; but I have a partner, and you know the Italian proverb—Chi ha compagno ha padrone—‘He who has a partner has a master.’ But the thing is at least half done, as you have one out of two votes.

Morrel, I thank you in the name of my father and of Mercédès.”\n\n“Good, Edmond,” said M. Morrel, a little moved himself, “there is a father who waits for you, and a Mercédès who waits for you; go and see them, and to-morrow come to me.”\n\n“Shall I not anchor in the port?” asked Dantès.\n\n“No; if the wind holds as it is, that is to say, northeast, you can make the traverse in less than an hour; but what are you fretting about, Edmond? It seems to me that you are not glad to see Marseilles again.”\n\n“Not glad! On the contrary, my dear sir.”\n\n“Why, then, do you ask my advice? Go off, I tell you.”\n\n“Yes, but I should like to talk to you about the voyage, and you have not questioned me.”\n\n“That is true, give me a summary.”\n\n“Well, sir, we had a fair voyage, and a good passage of the Dardanelles; but there we had a terrible storm, from which we escaped with great difficulty, thanks to the Almighty, and the coolness of our captain.”\n\n“Ah, our captain, M. Leclère, is dead, then?”\n\n“Yes, sir, he died in my arms at the Island of Elba, to which we were forced to put in by the storm.”\n\n“And what did you do then?”\n\n“I took the command, sir, as you had directed me to do on my departure.”\n\n“And you brought her safely into port?”\n\n“Yes, sir, as you see, sound and safe.”\n\n“Really,” said M. Morrel, “the old sailor was right when he told me that you were a clever fellow. And now, dear Edmond, there is your thousand francs—part of my promise. With this you can buy your wedding outfit, and I will keep my word.”\n\n“Oh, M. Morrel,” said Dantès, “do not make me rich; leave me my twenty crowns a month, and I am content; besides, there is some money due to me from the voyage.”\n\n“Yes, yes,” said M. Morrel, laughing, “you are right; let us not make a fortune at once. But,” added he, suddenly becoming serious, “what about this death of poor Leclère, and this stop at the Island of Elba? Explain all that to me, Edmond.”\n\n“It was very simple, sir. We were, as I told you, forced to put in by the storm. We had been at anchor about an hour when M. Leclère called me to him. He felt that he was dying, and he gave me a packet for the Grand Marshal Bertrand.”\n\n“For the Grand Marshal Bertrand?” exclaimed M. Morrel.\n\n“Yes, sir; do you know him?”\n\n“No, but I have heard him spoken of as a brave and loyal officer. And what did you do with this packet?”\n\n“I delivered it to him, sir.”\n\n“And what did he say?”\n\n“He made me promise to give a letter to a person in Paris, whose name and address he wrote on a piece of paper. He told me that it was a matter of great importance.”\n\n“And you are going to Paris?”\n\n“Yes, sir, as soon as I have seen my father and Mercédès.”\n\n“Very good, Edmond. But before you go, was there any one with you on board who was aware of M. Leclère’s dying wishes?”\n\n“No, sir, no one. M. Leclère confided in me alone.”\n\n“And you were satisfied with Danglars?”\n\n“Satisfied with him as a shipmate, sir? I cannot say that I was. I have had a slight difference with him.”\n\n“A difference with Danglars?”\n\n“Yes, sir, and I even challenged him to a duel on Monte Cristo, but he refused.”\n\n“Ah, indeed! And what was the cause of this quarrel?”\n\n“Oh, nothing of importance, sir. He was jealous of me, I think, because M. Leclère had shown me some preference.”\n\n“But as supercargo, was he competent?”\n\n“Yes, sir, very competent. I believe you will be satisfied with his accounts.”\n\n“But if you were captain, would you be glad to keep him?”\n\n“Captain, sir?” said Dantès, blushing. “I am only the mate.”\n\n“But you might be captain some day, might you not?”\n\n“Yes, sir, if I were fortunate enough to obtain your confidence.”\n\n“Well, Edmond, I have confidence in you, and I am very glad to hear you speak so well of Danglars, in spite of your little difference. It shows that you have a good heart. Go now, and be",

The news of the arrival of the Pharaon had not yet reached the old man, who, mounted on a chair, was amusing himself by training with trembling hand the nasturtiums and sprays of clematis that clambered over the trellis at his window. Suddenly, he felt an arm thrown around his body, and a well-known voice behind him exclaimed, “Father—dear father!”\nThe old man uttered a cry, and turned round; then, seeing his son, he fell into his arms, pale and trembling.\n“What ails you, my dearest father? Are you ill?” inquired the young man, much alarmed.\n“No, no, my dear Edmond—my boy—my son!—no; but I did not expect you; and joy, the surprise of seeing you so suddenly—Ah, I feel as if I were going to die.”\n“Come, come, cheer up, my dear father! ’Tis I—really I! They say joy never hurts, and so I came to you without any warning. Come now, do smile, instead of looking at me so solemnly. Here I am back again, and we are going to be happy.”\n“Yes, yes, my boy, so we will—so we will,” replied the old man; “but how shall we be happy? Shall you never leave me again? Come, tell me all the good fortune that has befallen you.”\n“God forgive me,” said the young man, “for rejoicing at happiness derived from the misery of others, but, Heaven knows, I did not seek this good fortune; it has happened, and I really cannot pretend to lament it. The good Captain Leclere is dead, father, and it is probable that, with the aid of M. Morrel, I shall have his place. Do you understand, father? Only imagine me a captain at twenty, with a hundred louis pay, and a share in the profits! Is this not more than a poor sailor like me could have hoped for?”\n“Yes, my dear boy,” replied the old man, “it is very fortunate.”\n“Well, then, with the first money I touch, I mean you to have a small house, with a garden in which to plant clematis, nasturtiums, and honeysuckle. But what ails you, father? Are you not well?”\n“’Tis nothing, nothing; it will soon pass away”—and as he said so the old man’s strength failed him, and he fell backwards.\n“Come, come,” said the young man, “a glass of wine, father, will revive you. Where do you keep your wine?”\n“No, no; thanks. You need not look for it; I do not want it,” said the old man.\n“Yes, yes, father, tell me where it is,” and he opened two or three cupboards.\n“It is no use,” said the old man, “there is no wine.”\n“What, no wine?” said Dantès, turning pale, and looking alternately at the hollow cheeks of the old man and the empty cupboards. “What, no wine? Have you wanted money, father?”\n“I want nothing now that I have you,” said the old man.\n“Yet,” stammered Dantès, wiping the perspiration from his brow,—“yet I gave you two hundred francs when I left, three months ago.”\n“Yes, yes, Edmond, that is true, but you forgot at that time a little debt to our neighbor, Caderousse. He reminded me of it, telling me if I did not pay for you, he would be paid by M. Morrel; and so, you see, lest he might do you an injury——”\n“Well?”\n“Why, I paid him.”\n“But,” cried Dantès, “it was a hundred and forty francs I owed Caderousse.”\n“Yes,” stammered the old man.\n“And you paid him out of the two hundred francs I left you?”\nThe old man nodded.\n“So that you have lived for three months on sixty francs,” muttered Edmond.\n“You know how little I require,” said the old man.\n“Heaven pardon me,” cried Edmond, falling on his knees before his father.\n“What are you doing?”\n“You have wounded me to the heart.”\n“Never mind it, for I see you once more,” said the old man; “and now it’s all over—everything is all right again.”\n“Yes, here I am,” said the young man, “with a promising future and a little money. Here, father, here!” he said, “take this—take it, and send for something immediately.” And he emptied his pockets on the table, the contents consisting of a dozen gold pieces, five or six five-franc pieces, and some smaller coin. The countenance of old Dantès brightened.\n“Whom does this belong to?” he inquired.\n“To me, to you, to us! Take it; buy some provisions; be happy, and tomorrow we shall have more.”\n“Gently, gently,” said the old man, with a smile; “and by your leave I will use your purse moderately, for they would say, if they saw me buy too many things at a time, that I had been obliged to await your return, in order to be able to purchase them.”\n“Do as you please; but, first of all, pray have a servant, father. I will not have you left alone so long. I have some smuggled coffee and most capital tobacco, in a small chest in the hold, which you shall have tomorrow. But, hush, here comes somebody.”",

This room was occupied by Dantès’ father. The news of the arrival of the Pharaon had not reached the old man, who, silent and motionless, was maintaining an energetic struggle with poverty. The sun, which was now beginning to decline, shone full upon his countenance, and revealed in its every feature the ravages of some deep sorrow. Old Dantès was seated in an armchair, with a look of painful resignation on his face, and holding in his trembling hands a species of vine, which he was carefully pruning. All at once he felt a firm but light touch on his shoulder, and heard a well-known voice behind him. His son had recognized him from the door of the chamber, where he had remained for a moment, unperceived, gazing with an emotion that almost choked him, on that face bearing the traces of such deep grief. He had then entered, and thrown his arms around his father’s neck. The old man uttered a cry, and fainted. He had no strength to support this excess of joy. Edmond replaced the chair on which he had been sitting, and in which he had fallen, and cast a hasty glance around the apartment. It was poor, but cleanly. A few articles of absolute necessity composed the furniture. The bed, upon which Dantès had so often passed happy nights, was in one corner; a table stood in the middle of the room, and on it were a few books, with yellow covers, and torn leaves; a box filled with mignonette, with its fragrant blossoms, was placed on the sill of the window, at which the old man was seated. This, with a clock, with a white face, and which the hands pointed to ten minutes past noon, was all the room contained. Old Dantès recovered at the expiration of a few seconds. He opened his eyes, and clasped the hand of his son. “Ah, Edmond!” said he, “my dear Edmond! you are returned? Never mind me—I am not ill. It is only that I am made happy by your presence, and joy, you know, makes one giddy.” “Yes, father, I am returned,” replied the young man, preventing the old man from rising; “stay where you are, I entreat you. You have not recovered yet from the emotion my arrival has occasioned. It is true, then, that you expected me?” “Ah, I expected you!” cried the old man, “since the report of the arrival of the Pharaon yesterday. Why did you not come to me at once? Has that Danglars, who, I hear, is supercargo on board, prevented you?” “No, father; I arrived a few hours ago, and as soon as I could I came to you.” “You were right, Edmond, to come to me first, although I must say I think it was not quite right of M. Morrel to detain you so long. But never mind, you are here, and we are happy. There is time enough to think of the rest.” “Father,” said Edmond, smiling, “it appears to me that you are not aware that I am rich.” “You rich?” cried the old man; “you, Edmond, my dear boy, rich? with your six-and-twenty francs a month?” “Yes, father, rich; rich beyond all my hopes. You are aware that the captain, Leclere, is dead?” “Alas!” cried old Dantès, and has he gone too? a worthy man, and one who loved you dearly, Edmond.” “Yes, father, he is dead; and before he died he gave me the ship’s papers, and charged me to deliver a packet to the grand marshal; but that is not all. He appointed me supercargo in his place; and it is not unlikely that I shall be appointed captain of the Pharaon; for M. Morrel has promised me that I shall have the appointment.” “Ah, my dear boy!” cried the old man, raising his hands, and looking upwards, “what happiness!” “Yes, father, happiness. But what is the matter? you seem faint.” “It is nothing, my dear boy—nothing. It will pass over. Give me a glass of wine, and I shall be better.” “Wine? I have none,” replied Edmond, looking around him in vain. “No wine!” cried the old man; “how is that?” “Do not be uneasy, father; I have money,” said Edmond, “here.” And he drew from his pocket a handful of gold, and silver, and placed it on the table. “Money!” cried the old man, with a look of surprise; “where did you get all that money? You have not been robbing any one, Edmond?” “No, father, I have not been robbing any one; this is the fruit of my labor. M. Morrel has paid me all my wages, and I have earned some money besides by selling some goods I had on board.” “Ah, my dear boy!” cried the old man, “you are so good, so kind, so thoughtful. And you have brought me all this money? It is too much, Edmond, too much.” “No, father, it is not too much; it is not enough. I have not been able to provide for you as I ought to have done. But now, with this money, you can buy yourself some clothes, and some food, and some wine, and you can have a fire, and be comfortable.” “Yes, my dear boy,” said the old man, “I will do as you tell me; but you must not leave me again. You must stay with me, and we will be happy together.” “Yes, father, I will stay with you; but I must go and see Mercédès. You know I have not seen her yet.” “Go, my dear boy, go; but do not stay long. You know how anxious I am to see you again.” “I will not stay long, father; I will be back in an hour.” “Take care of yourself, my dear boy,” said the old man; “and do not forget that you have a father who loves you dearly.” “No, father, I will not forget,” replied Edmond; and he embraced his father, and left the room. Old Dantès remained for a moment motionless, and then, with a sigh, he rose, and went to the window. He saw his son disappear in the crowd, and then he returned to his chair, and sat down, with his head in his hands. He was so happy, and yet so sad. He was happy to see his son again, but he was sad to think that he must leave him so soon. He was sad to think that he was so poor, and that his son was so rich. He was sad to think that he was so old, and that his son was so young. He was sad to think that he was so weak, and that his son was so strong. He was sad to think that he was so lonely, and that his son was so surrounded by friends. He was sad to think that he was so near his end, and that his son was so far from his beginning. He was sad to think that he was so useless, and that his son was so useful. He was sad to think that he was so forgotten, and that his son was so remembered. He was sad to think that he was so despised, and that his son was so honored. He was sad to think that he was so poor, and that his son was so rich. He was sad to think that he was so old, and that his son was so young. He was sad to think that he was so weak, and that his son was so strong. He was sad to think that",

I have none,” replied Edmond, looking around him in vain. “No wine!” cried the old man; “how is that?” “Do not be uneasy, father; I have money,” said Edmond, “here.” And he drew from his pocket a handful of gold, and silver, and placed it on the table. “Money!” cried the old man, with a look of surprise; “where did you get all that money? You have not been robbing any one, Edmond?” “No, father, I have not been robbing any one; this is the fruit of my labor. M. Morrel has paid me all my wages, and I have earned some money besides by selling some goods I had on board.” “Ah, my dear boy!” cried the old man, “you are so good, so kind, so thoughtful. And you have brought me all this money? It is too much, Edmond, too much.” “No, father, it is not too much; it is not enough. I have not been able to provide for you as I ought to have done. But now, with this money, you can buy yourself some clothes, and some food, and some wine, and you can have a fire, and be comfortable.” “Yes, my dear boy,” said the old man, “I will do as you tell me; but you must not leave me again. You must stay with me, and we will be happy together.” “Yes, father, I will stay with you; but I must go and see Mercédès. You know I have not seen her yet.” “Go, my dear boy, go; but do not stay long. You know how anxious I am to see you again.” “I will not stay long, father; I will be back in an hour.” “Take care of yourself, my dear boy,” said the old man; “and do not forget that you have a father who loves you dearly.” “No, father, I will not forget,” replied Edmond; and he embraced his father, and left the room. Old Dantès remained for a moment motionless, and then, with a sigh, he rose, and went to the window. He saw his son disappear in the crowd, and then he returned to his chair, and sat down, with his head in his hands. He was so happy, and yet so sad. He was happy to see his son again, but he was sad to think that he must leave him so soon. He was sad to think that he was so poor, and that his son was so rich. He was sad to think that he was so old, and that his son was so young. He was sad to think that he was so weak, and that his son was so strong. He was sad to think that he was so lonely, and that his son was so surrounded by friends. He was sad to think that he was so near his end, and that his son was so far from his beginning. He was sad to think that he was so useless, and that his son was so useful. He was sad to think that he was so forgotten, and that his son was so remembered. He was sad to think that he was so despised, and that his son was so honored. He was sad to think that he was so poor, and that his son was so rich. He was sad to think that he was so old, and that his son was so young. He was sad to think that he was so weak, and that his son was so strong. He was sad to think that",

            "prefix-probing": "We will leave Danglars struggling with the demon of hatred, and endeavoring to insinuate in the ear of the shipowner some evil suspicions against his comrade, and follow Dantès, who, after having traversed La Canebière, took the Rue de Noailles, and entering a small house, on the left of the Allées de Meilhan, rapidly ascended four flights of a dark staircase, holding the baluster with one hand, while with the other he repressed the beatings of his heart, and paused before a half-open door, from which he could see the whole of a small room. This room was clean, though poor. A few pieces of furniture, plain and necessary, composed its whole wealth. A wooden table, four chairs, a chest of drawers, and a bed, were all it contained. But on the bed was seated a young woman, whose beauty was so remarkable that it instantly attracted the eye of the young sailor. She was of the Catalans, a race of people of Spanish origin, who inhabit a quarter of the city of Marseilles near the sea, and who preserve with jealous care their ancient customs and the purity of their blood. Mercédès was dressed in a red and black bodice, and a skirt of the same colors; a golden bodkin confined her hair, and her ears were adorned with long, dangling earrings. Her eyes, of the deepest black, sparkled with a fire that seemed to have been kindled in the East; her lips were of a coral red, and her teeth of the purest pearl. She was leaning her elbow on the chest of drawers, and her head on her hand, in an attitude of thoughtful melancholy. At the sound of Dantès' step, she raised her head, and a cry of joy escaped her lips. Dantès rushed into the room, and in an instant Mercédès was in his arms. 'Oh, Edmond! my dear Edmond!' she cried, 'you are safe! you are here! I have been so anxious!' 'My beautiful Mercédès!' said Dantès, pressing her to his heart, 'I am here, and I am happy, since I see you.' 'But you must have traveled with great speed?' 'I did, indeed. The good ship *Pharaon* sailed like a bird. And what is more, Mercédès, I am here to stay. My good employer, M. Morrel, has promised me the command of the *Pharaon* as soon as the present captain retires, and that will be very soon. Think of it, Mercédès, I, a captain at twenty years of age!' 'A captain! Oh, Edmond, that is good news indeed!' 'And with the command, Mercédès, comes a good salary, and a position that will allow me to provide for you and my father as you deserve. We will be rich, Mercédès, or at least, we will be comfortable. No more poverty, no more struggling.' 'That is not what makes me happy, Edmond,' said Mercédès, looking at him with eyes full of love. 'It is seeing you, knowing you are safe, and knowing that you love me.' 'And I love you more than life itself, Mercédès. And now that I am a captain, and can support a wife, there is nothing to prevent our marriage. We will be married as soon as possible, my Mercédès, the day after tomorrow, if you wish.' A blush spread over the cheeks of Mercédès. 'So soon, Edmond?' 'Why delay? We have waited long enough. My father will be happy, too. Where is he?' 'He is not well, Edmond. He has been very anxious about you. He is in his room.' Dantès' brow clouded. 'Not well? What is the matter?' 'He is old, Edmond, and he has suffered. He has been in want.' 'In want?' cried Dantès, his voice trembling with emotion. 'My father in want? While I was away, earning money?' 'Do not blame yourself, Edmond. He would not let me help him much. He is proud.' Dantès rushed towards the door of the adjoining room. He found his father seated in an armchair, pale and thin. At the sight of his son, the old man uttered a cry and stretched out his arms. Dantès threw himself on his knees before him, and buried his head in his father's lap. 'Father! my dear father! What is this? You are ill!' 'No, my son, I am well now that I see you,' said the old man, his voice broken by sobs. 'But you have suffered, father. Mercédès told me.' 'A little, my son, a little. But it is over now. You are here.' 'And I will never leave you again, father. I will take care of you. We will all live together, Mercédès, you, and I. I am a captain now, father, a captain! And I am going to marry Mercédès the day after tomorrow.' The old man looked from his son to Mercédès, his eyes filled with tears of joy. 'A captain! Married! Oh, my son, God has blessed us!' Mercédès knelt beside Dantès, and took the old man's hand. 'We will be a happy family,' she said softly. 'Yes, yes,' murmured the old man, 'a happy family.' Dantès rose and helped his father to his feet"

He was a man of twenty-five or six, and held a piece of cloth, which, being a tailor, he was about to make into a coat-lining.\n“What, is it you, Edmond, back again?” said he, with a broad Marseillaise accent, and a grin that displayed his ivory-white teeth.\n“Yes, as you see, neighbor Caderousse; and ready to be agreeable to you in any and every way,” replied Dantès, but ill-concealing his coldness under this cloak of civility.\n“Thanks—thanks; but, fortunately, I do not want for anything; and it chances that at times there are others who have need of me.” Dantès made a gesture. “I do not allude to you, my boy. No!—no! I lent you money, and you returned it; that’s like good neighbors, and we are quits.”\n“We are never quits with those who oblige us,” was Dantès’ reply; “for when we do not owe them money, we owe them gratitude.”\n“What’s the use of mentioning that? What is done is done. Let us talk of your happy return, my boy. I had gone on the quay to match a piece of mulberry cloth, when I met friend Danglars. ‘You at Marseilles?’—‘Yes,’ says he.\n“‘I thought you were at Smyrna.’—‘I was; but am now back again.’\n“‘And where is the dear boy, our little Edmond?’\n“‘Why, with his father, no doubt,’ replied Danglars. And so I came,” added Caderousse, “as fast as I could to have the pleasure of shaking hands with a friend.”\n“Worthy Caderousse!” said the old man, “he is so much attached to us.”\n“Yes, to be sure I am. I love and esteem you, because honest folks are so rare. But it seems you have come back rich, my boy,” continued the tailor, looking askance at the handful of gold and silver which Dantès had thrown on the table.\nThe young man remarked the greedy glance which shone in the dark eyes of his neighbor. “Eh,” he said, negligently, “this money is not mine. I was expressing to my father my fears that he had wanted many things in my absence, and to convince me he emptied his purse on the table. Come, father” added Dantès, “put this money back in your box—unless neighbor Caderousse wants anything, and in that case it is at his service.”\n“No, my boy, no,” said Caderousse. “I am not in any want, thank God, my living is suited to my means. Keep your money—keep it, I say;—one never has too much;—but, at the same time, my boy, I am as much obliged by your offer as if I took advantage of it.”\n“It was offered with good will,” said Dantès.\n“No doubt, my boy; no doubt. Well, you stand well with M. Morrel I hear,—you insinuating dog, you!”\n“M. Morrel has always been exceedingly kind to me,” replied Dantès.\n“Then you were wrong to refuse to dine with him.”\n“What, did you refuse to dine with him?” said old Dantès; “and did he invite you to dine?”\n“Yes, my dear father,” replied Edmond, smiling at his father’s astonishment at the excessive honor paid to his son.\n“And why did you refuse, my son?” inquired the old man.\n“That I might the sooner see you again, my dear father,” replied the young man. “I was most anxious to see you.”\n“But it must have vexed M. Morrel, good, worthy man,” said Caderousse. “And when you are looking forward to be captain, it was wrong to annoy the owner.”\n“But I explained to him the cause of my refusal,” replied Dantès, “and I hope he fully understood it.”\n“Yes, but to be captain one must do a little flattery to one’s patrons.”\n“I hope to be captain without that,” said Dantès.\n“So much the better—so much the better! Nothing will give greater pleasure to all your old friends; and I know one down there behind the Saint Nicolas citadel who will not be sorry to hear it.”\n“Mercédès?” said the old man.\n“Yes, my dear father, and with your permission, now I have seen you, and know you are well and have all you require, I will ask your consent to go and pay a visit to the Catalans.”\n“Go, my dear boy,” said old Dantès; “and Heaven bless you in your wife, as it has blessed me in my son!”\n“His wife!” said Caderousse; “why, how fast you go on, father Dantès; she is not his wife yet, as it seems to me.”\n“No, but according to all probability she soon will be,” replied Edmond.\n“Yes—yes,” said Caderousse; “but you were right to return as soon as possible, my boy.”\n“And why?”\n“Because Mercédès is a very fine girl, and fine girls never lack followers; she particularly has them by dozens.”\n“Really?” answered Edmond, with a smile which had in it traces of slight uneasiness.\n“Ah, yes,” continued Caderousse, “and capital offers, too; but you know, you will be captain, and who could refuse you then?”\n“Meaning to say,” replied Dantès, with a smile which but ill-concealed his trouble, “that if I were not a captain——”\n“Eh—eh!” said Caderousse, shaking his head.\n“Come, come,” said the sailor, “I have a better opinion than you of women in general, and of Mercédès in particular; and I am certain that, captain or not, she will remain ever faithful to me.”\n“So much the better—so much the better,” said Caderousse. “When one is going to be married, there is nothing like implicit confidence; but never mind that, my boy,—go and announce your arrival, and let her know all your hopes and prospects.”\n“I will go directly,” was Edmond’s reply; and, embracing his father, and nodding to Caderousse, he left the apartment.",

And it is a fine thing to be lucky, like you, at twenty-one. But I didn’t come to disturb you, I know you must have much to say.”\n\n“No, no, Caderousse; sit down,” said Dantès, motioning to a chair; “and tell me what news there is of the Rue Saint-Ferréol, and the Cannebière, and the Cours Saint-Louis.”\n\n“Why, nothing particular; only the talk is about your speedy promotion, and about the splendid fortune you are about to make, and then, about the pretty girl you are going to marry, who is as beautiful as a queen.”\n\n“She is a worthy girl, Caderousse,” said Dantès, “and one who will render me very happy.”\n\n“That is what you deserve, my boy,” said old Dantès; “for you have been a good son to me, and God will reward you by giving you a good wife.”\n\n“That is all very well,” said Caderousse, “but it is a pity that the marriage cannot take place directly, as you are obliged to go to Paris.”\n\n“Ah, yes,” said Dantès, “that is true.”\n\n“But,” observed Caderousse, “why not get married before you go?”\n\n“Because,” replied Dantès, “everything is not yet arranged; and I wish to be able to leave my wife in a comfortable position.”\n\n“Ah, that is very thoughtful of you,” said Caderousse, with a smile that was more like a grimace. “But you know, my dear fellow, that ‘delays are dangerous,’ and that when a girl is pretty, there are always plenty of suitors.”\n\n“Oh, Mercédès is not a coquette,” said Dantès, with a proud smile; “and I am sure that she will wait for me.”\n\n“So much the better for you,” said Caderousse; “but still, you know, a voyage to Paris is a long voyage, and during that time, who knows what may happen?”\n\n“The only thing that can happen,” said Dantès, “is that I shall be made captain; and in that case, I shall be able to offer Mercédès a position worthy of her.”\n\n“Ah, that is a very good reason,” said Caderousse; “and I hope with all my heart that you will succeed.”\n\n“Thank you, Caderousse,” said Dantès; “and now, as you say, I must leave my father, and go and see Mercédès.”\n\n“Yes, yes, go,” said old Dantès; “and may God bless you, my dear boy, and your wife, and your children.”\n\nEdmond embraced his father, nodded to Caderousse, and left the apartment.",

His clothes were ragged and stained, and he walked with the unsteady gait of one who had been drinking heavily. He stopped short on seeing the Abbé Busoni, and his expression changed from one of hopeful anticipation to cautious suspicion.\n\n“Good evening, Father,” he mumbled, pulling awkwardly at his cap. “They told me… they told me a holy man was here, asking about… about old times.”\n\n“Enter, my son,” said the abbé, his voice calm and measured, giving no hint of the tempest raging within him. “You are Caderousse, are you not?

I understand you knew him?”\n\nAt the mention of Edmond’s name, Caderousse’s face clouded over, a mixture of fear and regret crossing his features. He glanced nervously at the innkeeper, who discreetly withdrew, leaving them alone.\n\n“Edmond Dantès?” Caderousse repeated, his voice lower. “Aye, I knew him. A fine lad, he was. Honest, brave… destined for great things, everyone said.” He paused, then added with a sigh, “Until misfortune struck.”\n\n“Misfortune indeed,” said the abbé, leaning forward slightly. “I have heard whispers of betrayal, of enemies who envied his success. Is there truth to these rumours?”\n\nCaderousse hesitated, licking his dry lips. He eyed the wine bottle again. The abbé followed his gaze. “Perhaps a glass of wine would help loosen your tongue, my son? It has been a long day, no doubt.”\n\nCaderousse’s eyes lit up. “Ah, Father, you are too kind!” He eagerly poured himself a generous measure, drank it down in one gulp, and poured another. The wine seemed to embolden him, washing away some of his reticence.\n\n“Betrayal, you say?” he began, wiping his mouth with the back of his hand. “Aye, there was betrayal. Foul betrayal. It was all because of a letter, you see. A letter written to the public prosecutor.”\n\n“A letter?” the abbé prompted, his heart pounding beneath his cassock, though his face remained impassive. “Who wrote this letter, and what did it say?”\n\n“It was written by Danglars,” Caderousse confessed, his voice becoming a drunken mumble. “He was the supercargo on the *Pharaon*, jealous of Edmond because Captain Leclère had"

Dantès has no longer any occasion for assistance—he is about to become a captain.”\n“Pooh!” said Danglars, “he is not one yet.”\n“Ma foi! it will be as well if he is not,” answered Caderousse; “for if he should be, there will be really no speaking to him.”\n“If we choose,” replied Danglars, “he will remain what he is; and perhaps become even less than he is.”\n“What do you mean?”\n“Nothing—I was speaking to myself. And is he still in love with the Catalane?”\n“Over head and ears; but, unless I am much mistaken, there will be a storm in that quarter.”\n“Explain yourself.”\n“Why should I?”\n“It is more important than you think, perhaps. You do not like Dantès?”\n“I never like upstarts.”\n“Then tell me all you know about the Catalane.”\n“I know nothing for certain; only I have seen things which induce me to believe, as I told you, that the future captain will find some annoyance in the vicinity of the Vieilles Infirmeries.”\n“What have you seen?—come, tell me!”\n“Well, every time I have seen Mercédès come into the city she has been accompanied by a tall, strapping, black-eyed Catalan, with a red complexion, brown skin, and fierce air, whom she calls cousin.”\n“Really; and you think this cousin pays her attentions?”\n“I only suppose so.

Danglars was pacing impatiently, his hands clasped behind his back, his brow furrowed. The moment he saw Caderousse emerge, he stopped abruptly. “Well?” he demanded, his voice low and urgent. “What news? How is the old man?”\n\nCaderousse shrugged, a gesture of indifference that ill-suited the gravity of the situation. “As you might expect,” he said. “Distraught. He knows nothing, of course, except that his son has been taken. He thinks it’s a mistake, a misunderstanding.”\n\n“A mistake?” Danglars scoffed, a cruel glint in his eye. “Hardly. The gendarmes don’t make mistakes of that nature. Treason is a serious charge.”\n\n“Treason,” Caderousse repeated, a shiver running down his spine despite the warm Marseille air. “It seems incredible. Edmond? A Bonapartist?”\n\n“He carried a letter,” Danglars stated flatly, watching Caderousse closely. “From the Isle of Elba. To a certain Noirtier, a prominent Bonapartist in Paris. I saw it myself, in his pocketbook, when he asked me to deliver it.”\n\nCaderousse’s eyes widened slightly. “You saw it? And you said nothing?”\n\n“Why should I?” Danglars countered, a sly smile playing on his lips. “It was not my affair. Besides, I had my suspicions about that voyage. He was too eager to please Captain Leclère, too quick to accept that commission. And now… well, the timing is rather unfortunate for him, isn’t it? Just as he was about to be made captain, just as he was about to marry Mercédès.”\n\nHe paused, letting the implications sink in. Caderousse shifted uncomfortably. “But… the denunciation? Who could have…?”\n\nDanglars held his gaze, his expression unreadable for a moment, then he gave a short, dry laugh. “Marseille is full of loyal citizens, Caderousse. In times like these, people are quick to report anything that smacks of disloyalty to the King. Perhaps someone overheard him speaking, perhaps someone saw the letter. Who knows? It’s the King’s justice, swift and sure.”\n\nHe leaned closer, lowering his voice further. “The important thing now is discretion. We know nothing. We saw nothing. We heard nothing. Edmond was arrested, yes, a great misfortune, but we have no idea why. Do you understand?”\n\nCaderousse nodded slowly, the fear of implication outweighing any lingering sense of unease or guilt. “Yes,” he murmured. “We know nothing.”\n\n“Good,” Danglars said, straightening up. “It is for the best. For all of us. Now, let us go. We have work to do, and the less we are seen loitering here, the better.” He turned and walked away, leaving Caderousse to follow, the weight of their shared secret settling heavily between them in the quiet street."

Ah, to have dreamed for ten years of being your husband, Mercédès, and to lose that hope, which was the only stay of my existence!”\n“At least it was not I who ever encouraged you in that hope, Fernand,” replied Mercédès; “you cannot reproach me with the slightest coquetry. I have always said to you, ‘I love you as a brother; but do not ask from me more than sisterly affection, for my heart is another’s.’ Is not this true, Fernand?”\n“Yes, that is very true, Mercédès,” replied the young man, “Yes, you have been cruelly frank with me; but do you forget that it is among the Catalans a sacred law to intermarry?”\n“You mistake, Fernand; it is not a law, but merely a custom, and, I pray of you, do not cite this custom in your favor. You are included in the conscription, Fernand, and are only at liberty on sufferance, liable at any moment to be called upon to take up arms. Once a soldier, what would you do with me, a poor orphan, forlorn, without fortune, with nothing but a half-ruined hut and a few ragged nets, the miserable inheritance left by my father to my mother, and by my mother to me? She has been dead a year, and you know, Fernand, I have subsisted almost entirely on public charity. Sometimes you pretend I am useful to you, and that is an excuse to share with me the produce of your fishing, and I accept it, Fernand, because you are the son of my father’s brother, because we were brought up together, and still more because it would give you so much pain if I refuse. But I feel very deeply that this fish which I go and sell, and with the produce of which I buy the flax I spin,—I feel very keenly, Fernand, that this is charity.”\n“And if it were, Mercédès, poor and lone as you are, you suit me as well as the daughter of the first shipowner or the richest banker of Marseilles! What do such as we desire but a good wife and careful housekeeper, and where can I look for these better than in you?”\n“Fernand,” answered Mercédès, shaking her head, “a woman becomes a bad manager, and who shall say she will remain an honest woman, when she loves another man better than her husband? Rest content with my friendship, for I say once more that is all I can promise, and I will promise no more than I can bestow.",

It was the house of the Catalans. In the single room, of which this habitation consisted, a young and beautiful woman, with eyes as black as velvet, and hair as black as jet, was seated at a table, plaiting a straw hat, while, at the door, a young man, of twenty or twenty-one, with a soldier-like appearance, watched her with a look in which vexation and uneasiness were mingled with much admiration. He was dressed in the picturesque costume of the Catalans, the red and brown cap, the brown jacket and velvet breeches, the sash round the waist, and the long, brown gaiters which reached to the knee; a costume which, borrowed from the Moors, was formerly common to all the shores of the Mediterranean, and which the Catalans alone have preserved, as they have preserved the language of their fathers. At the moment when the young man was about to address the young woman, a child entered, carrying a letter in his hand. It was addressed to Mercédès, the name of the beautiful Catalan. Mercédès took the letter, and read it with an expression of joy which brought a smile to her lips. \"It is from Edmond,\" she said, \"he is at Marseilles, and will be here in two hours.\" The young man started, and his brow darkened. \"From Edmond!\" he repeated, \"and what does he say?\" \"He says that he is well, and that he loves me,\" replied Mercédès, with a smile. \"And that is all?\" asked the young man, with a bitter smile. \"Yes, that is all,\" replied Mercédès. \"And you are happy?\" asked the young man. \"Yes, I am happy,\" replied Mercédès. \"And you expect him?\" asked the young man. \"Yes, I expect him,\" replied Mercédès. \"And you will marry him?\" asked the young man. \"Yes, I will marry him,\" replied Mercédès.

Fernand went out, and Mercédès remained alone, with the letter in her hand. She read it again, and pressed it to her heart. She was happy. Fernand walked along the street, with his head down, and his hands clasped behind his back. He was unhappy. He stopped at the end of the street, and looked at the sea.

He is too happy to think of anything but his good fortune.” “Ah,” said Mercédès, “do not make me angry, Fernand; for you do not know how far I can go when I am angry. If you were to attack Edmond, I would—I do not know what I would do—but I would do something.” “You would do something? What would you do? You would not, I suppose, kill me?” “No, but I would kill myself.” Fernand drew back, and a cold perspiration covered his brow. “You are mad, Mercédès,” he said. “No,” replied she, “but I am resolved. If you lay a hand on Edmond, I will kill myself. I swear it by the Holy Virgin!” “Foolish girl!” said Fernand, approaching her. “You are weeping.” “Yes, I am weeping,” said Mercédès, “and you are the cause of my tears. Why do you torment me thus? I love Edmond, and I will marry him. He loves me, and he will marry me. There is nothing to be said against that. Leave me, Fernand; leave me, I implore you.” “But if he should forget you?” said Fernand.",

Eugénie Danglars stood before her father, the wealthy banker, her face pale but set in defiance. The news he had just delivered – the finalization of her engagement to Andrea Cavalcanti, a man she despised and suspected of being a scoundrel – felt like a physical blow. She had pleaded, argued, even threatened, but her father remained unmoved, his gaze fixed on the financial advantages of the union. \"You cannot do this, Father!\" she cried, her voice trembling with suppressed fury. \"You are selling me! Selling me to a man I loathe, a man whose very presence makes my skin crawl!\" Monsieur Danglars merely shrugged, adjusting his cravat. \"Nonsense, Eugénie. He is a prince, a man of title and fortune. This marriage will solidify our position, connect us to the old aristocracy. Your romantic notions are childish.\" \"Childish?\" she echoed, a bitter laugh escaping her lips. \"Is it childish to wish for a life of my own, to pursue my music, to choose my own path? You speak of position and fortune, but what of my happiness? What of my soul?\" Her father's face hardened. \"Your happiness lies in obedience and duty. You will marry Cavalcanti. The contracts are signed, the date is set. There is nothing more to discuss.\" Eugénie felt a wave of despair wash over her, quickly followed by a resurgence of that burning anger. She looked at the man who was supposed to protect her, her father, and saw only a cold, calculating merchant. He saw her not as a daughter, but as a commodity, a pawn in his endless game of wealth and power. The gesture of rage was not enough. It was a silent scream against the gilded cage he was building around her. She turned abruptly, her skirts swirling, and fled the room, leaving her father to his ledgers and his schemes, her mind racing with desperate plans for escape."

Suddenly Edmond saw the gloomy, pale, and threatening countenance of Fernand, as it was defined in the shadow. By a movement for which he could scarcely account to himself, the young Catalan placed his hand on the knife at his belt.\n“Ah, your pardon,” said Dantès, frowning in his turn; “I did not perceive that there were three of us.” Then, turning to Mercédès, he inquired, “Who is this gentleman?”\n“One who will be your best friend, Dantès, for he is my friend, my cousin, my brother; it is Fernand—the man whom, after you, Edmond, I love the best in the world.

It’s not polite not to reply to friends who ask news of your health.”\n“My health is well enough,” said Fernand, clenching his hands without raising his head.\n“Ah, you see, Danglars,” said Caderousse, winking at his friend, “this is how it is; Fernand, whom you see here, is a good and brave Catalan, one of the best fishermen in Marseilles, and he is in love with a very fine girl, named Mercédès; but it appears, unfortunately, that the fine girl is in love with the mate of the Pharaon; and as the Pharaon arrived today—why, you understand!”\n“No; I do not understand,” said Danglars.\n“Poor Fernand has been dismissed,” continued Caderousse.\n“Well, and what then?” said Fernand, lifting up his head, and looking at Caderousse like a man who looks for someone on whom to vent his anger; “Mercédès is not accountable to any person, is she? Is she not free to love whomsoever she will?”\n“Oh, if you take it in that sense,” said Caderousse, “it is another thing. But I thought you were a Catalan, and they told me the Catalans were not men to allow themselves to be supplanted by a rival. It was even told me that Fernand, especially, was terrible in his vengeance.”\nFernand smiled piteously. “A lover is never terrible,” he said.\n“Poor fellow!” remarked Danglars, affecting to pity the young man from the bottom of his heart. “Why, you see, he did not expect to see Dantès return so suddenly—he thought he was dead, perhaps; or perchance faithless! These things always come on us more severely when they come suddenly.”\n“Ah, ma foi, under any circumstances!” said Caderousse, who drank as he spoke, and on whom the fumes of the wine began to take effect,—“under any circumstances Fernand is not the only person put out by the fortunate arrival of Dantès; is he, Danglars?”\n“No, you are right—and I should say that would bring him ill-luck.”\n“Well, never mind,” answered Caderousse, pouring out a glass of wine for Fernand, and filling his own for the eighth or ninth time, while Danglars had merely sipped his. “Never mind—in the meantime he marries Mercédès—the lovely Mercédès—at least he returns to do that.”\nDuring this time Danglars fixed his piercing glance on the young man, on whose heart Caderousse’s words fell like molten lead.\n“And when is the wedding to be?” he asked.\n“Oh, it is not yet fixed!” murmured Fernand.\n“No, but it will be,” said Caderousse, “as surely as Dantès will be captain of the Pharaon—eh, Danglars?”\nDanglars shuddered at this unexpected attack, and turned to Caderousse, whose countenance he scrutinized, to try and detect whether the blow was premeditated; but he read nothing but envy in a countenance already rendered brutal and stupid by drunkenness.\n“Well,” said he, filling the glasses, “let us drink to Captain Edmond Dantès, husband of the beautiful Catalane!”\nCaderousse raised his glass to his mouth with unsteady hand, and swallowed the contents at a gulp. Fernand dashed his on the ground.\n“Eh, eh, eh!” stammered Caderousse. “What do I see down there by the wall, in the direction of the Catalans? Look, Fernand, your eyes are better than mine. I believe I see double. You know wine is a deceiver; but I should say it was two lovers walking side by side, and hand in hand. Heaven forgive me, they do not know that we can see them, and they are actually embracing!”\nDanglars did not lose one pang that Fernand endured.\n“Do you know them, Fernand?” he said.\n“Yes,” was the reply, in a low voice. “It is Edmond and Mercédès!”\n“Ah, see there, now!” said Caderousse; “and I did not recognize them! Hallo, Dantès! hello, lovely damsel! Come this way, and let us know when the wedding is to be, for Fernand here is so obstinate he will not tell us.”\n“Hold your tongue, will you?” said Danglars, pretending to restrain Caderousse, who, with the tenacity of drunkards, leaned out of the arbor. “Try to stand upright, and let the lovers make love without interruption. See, look at Fernand, and follow his example; he is well-behaved!”\nFernand, probably excited beyond bearing, pricked by Danglars, as the bull is by the bandilleros, was about to rush out; for he had risen from his seat, and seemed to be collecting himself to dash headlong upon his rival, when Mercédès, smiling and graceful, lifted up her lovely head, and looked at them with her clear and bright eyes. At this Fernand recollected her threat of dying if Edmond died, and dropped again heavily on his seat. Danglars looked at the two men, one after the other, the one brutalized by liquor, the other overwhelmed with love.",

The voices were those of Caderousse and Danglars, who were seated under an arbor at the entrance of the wine-shop of La Réserve. They were playing at cards, and seemed to be enjoying themselves. “Why, where are you running to?” said Caderousse again, taking his glass in one hand and his cards in the other. “Are you going to jump into the sea, or to be married?”\n“Why, look you, Caderousse,” said Danglars, “Fernand is so joyous that he does not know what to do. You disturb him in his transports.”\n“My transports are those of a madman,” said Fernand, making a violent effort to restrain his feelings.\n“Come, come, sit down with us,” said Caderousse, “and do not look so gloomy. You look like a rejected lover; but the beautiful Mercédès is not cruel, and the marriage will take place some day or other.”\n“No,” said Fernand, “Mercédès is not cruel; but she is a woman, and a woman has the right to love whom she pleases.”\n“She is right to love whom she pleases,” said Caderousse; “and she is right to displease whom she pleases. But it seems to me that she displeases you.”\n“She does not displease me,” said Fernand; “she is free to do as she likes.”\n“Yes, but you are not free to do as you like, since you are running away like a madman,” said Caderousse, laughing. “Come, sit down, and take a glass of wine with us.”\nFernand sat down, or rather fell into a chair. “You are not in your usual spirits, Fernand,” said Danglars. “What is the matter? Has the sudden return of Dantès vexed you?”\n“No,” said Fernand; “why should it vex me? I am not jealous of Edmond.”\n“Not jealous of Edmond!” exclaimed Caderousse; “you are not jealous of Edmond, who is going to marry Mercédès, the beautiful Catalane! Ah, bah! do not tell us that.”\n“I tell you that I am not jealous of him,” said Fernand; “and I repeat that Mercédès is free to do as she likes.”\n“Well, so much the better,” said Caderousse; “and since you are not jealous, let us drink to the health of Edmond and Mercédès.”\n“Yes, let us drink to their health,” said Danglars, filling the glasses. “To the health of Edmond and Mercédès!”\nThey both drank. Fernand took a glass, but instead of drinking, he dashed it against the ground with such violence that it broke into a thousand pieces.\n“Hallo, hallo!” cried Caderousse; “what is the matter? Are you mad?”\n“No,” said Fernand, “but I am not thirsty.”\n“Well, if you are not thirsty, that is no reason for breaking your glass,” said Caderousse. “Come, come, Fernand, do not be angry. It is all very well to be a Catalan, but you must not be so proud.”\n“I am not proud,” said Fernand; “but I am unhappy.”\n“Unhappy! and why?” said Danglars. “Because Mercédès loves Edmond? But you knew that before.”\n“Yes, but I hoped that he would forget her, or that he would die,” said Fernand.\n“He has not forgotten her, and he is not dead,” said Caderousse; “and what is more, he is going to be married to her, and he is going to be captain of the Pharaon.”\nDanglars started. The news of Dantès being appointed captain was as unexpected to him as it was disagreeable.\n“Captain of the Pharaon!” he muttered. “Yes, captain of the Pharaon,” said Caderousse; “and a very good captain he will make, for he is a brave and intelligent young man.”\n“Yes,” said Danglars, “he is a brave and intelligent young man; but it is a great pity that he should be so fortunate.”\n“Why so?” said Caderousse.\n“Because,” said Danglars, “when a man is so fortunate, it is a sign that he is going to meet with some great misfortune.”\n“Ah, bah!” said Caderousse; “that is a superstition.”\n“It may be a superstition, but it is true,” said Danglars. “However, let us not talk of misfortune. Let us drink to the health of Captain Edmond Dantès, husband of the beautiful Catalane!”\n“To the health of Captain Edmond Dantès, husband of the beautiful Catalane!” repeated Caderousse, emptying his glass.\nFernand said nothing, but he looked as if he were going to faint. At that moment, Caderousse, who had turned his head, cried out, “Look, look! there they are! Edmond and Mercédès!”\nDanglars and Fernand turned their heads also. At the end of the street, arm-in-arm, were walking Edmond and Mercédès. They were coming towards the arbor, and they were smiling at each other. They looked so happy that it was impossible to look at them without feeling a pang of envy.\n“They are coming this way,” said Caderousse. “Let us call them.”\n“No, no,” said Danglars; “do not call them. Let us leave them to their happiness.”\n“But I want to know when the wedding is to take place,” said Caderousse.\n“Ask Fernand,” said Danglars, with a malicious smile. “He knows all about it.”\nCaderousse turned to Fernand. “Well, Fernand,” said he, “when is the wedding to take place?”\nFernand made a violent effort to speak, but he could not utter a word. He rose from his chair, and seemed as if he were going to rush upon Edmond and Mercédès. But at that moment, Mercédès raised her head, and her eyes met those of Fernand. She gave him a look which made him tremble. It was a look of warning, a look which said, “If you dare to touch him, I will kill myself.”\nFernand understood the look. He sank back into his chair, pale and trembling. Danglars looked at him with a smile of triumph. Caderousse looked at him with a look of pity. The lovers passed by the arbor without",

            "He reflects that Edmond Dantès's fortunes are undeniably on the rise—securing marriage to Mercédès and the captaincy—unless he, Danglars, intervenes. A sinister smile hints at a developing scheme.",

            "Caderousse addresses Mercédès as 'Madame Dantès.' Mercédès politely but firmly corrects him, stating that in her culture, addressing a young woman by her betrothed's surname before marriage is considered an ill omen, and requests to be called Mercédès. Dantès smoothly makes excuses for Caderousse's faux pas.",
            "Danglars, with a veneer of politeness, inquires if the wedding will occur soon.",
            "Dantès confirms that the initial arrangements will be made at his father's residence that very day, with the wedding celebration to follow at La Réserve either the next day or the day after. He extends invitations to Danglars and Caderousse.",

Here’s an envious fellow making himself boozy on wine when he ought to be nursing his wrath, and here is a fool who sees the woman he loves stolen from under his nose and takes on like a big baby. Yet this Catalan has eyes that glisten like those of the vengeful Spaniards, Sicilians, and Calabrians, and the other has fists big enough to crush an ox at one blow. Unquestionably, Edmond’s star is in the ascendant, and he will marry the splendid girl—he will be captain, too, and laugh at us all, unless”—a sinister smile passed over Danglars’ lips—“unless I take a hand in the affair,” he added.\n“Hallo!” continued Caderousse, half-rising, and with his fist on the table, “hallo, Edmond! do you not see your friends, or are you too proud to speak to them?”\n“No, my dear fellow!” replied Dantès, “I am not proud, but I am happy, and happiness blinds, I think, more than pride.”\n“Ah, very well, that’s an explanation!” said Caderousse. “How do you do, Madame Dantès?”\nMercédès courtesied gravely, and said—“That is not my name, and in my country it bodes ill fortune, they say, to call a young girl by the name of her betrothed before he becomes her husband. So call me Mercédès, if you please.”\n“We must excuse our worthy neighbor, Caderousse,” said Dantès, “he is so easily mistaken.”\n“So, then, the wedding is to take place immediately, M. Dantès,” said Danglars, bowing to the young couple.\n“As soon as possible, M. Danglars; today all preliminaries will be arranged at my father’s, and tomorrow, or next day at latest, the wedding festival here at La Réserve. My friends will be there, I hope; that is to say, you are invited, M. Danglars, and you, Caderousse.”\n“And Fernand,” said Caderousse with a chuckle; “Fernand, too, is invited!”\n“My wife’s brother is my brother,” said Edmond; “and we, Mercédès and I, should be very sorry if he were absent at such a time.”\nFernand opened his mouth to reply, but his voice died on his lips, and he could not utter a word.\n“Today the preliminaries, tomorrow or next day the ceremony! You are in a hurry, captain!”\n“Danglars,” said Edmond, smiling, “I will say to you as Mercédès said just now to Caderousse, ‘Do not give me a title which does not belong to me’; that may bring me bad luck.”\n“Your pardon,” replied Danglars, “I merely said you seemed in a hurry, and we have lots of time; the Pharaon cannot be under weigh again in less than three months.”\n“We are always in a hurry to be happy, M. Danglars; for when we have suffered a long time, we have great difficulty in believing in good fortune. But it is not selfishness alone that makes me thus in haste; I must go to Paris.”\n“Ah, really?—to Paris! and will it be the first time you have ever been there, Dantès?”\n“Yes.”\n“Have you business there?”\n“Not of my own; the last commission of poor Captain Leclere; you know to what I allude, Danglars—it is sacred. Besides, I shall only take the time to go and return.”\n“Yes, yes, I understand,” said Danglars, and then in a low tone, he added, “To Paris, no doubt to deliver the letter which the grand marshal gave him. Ah, this letter gives me an idea—a capital idea! Ah; Dantès, my friend, you are not yet registered number one on board the good ship Pharaon;” then turning towards Edmond, who was walking away, “A pleasant journey,” he cried.\n“Thank you,” said Edmond with a friendly nod, and the two lovers continued on their way, as calm and joyous as if they were the very elect of heaven.",

They will soon be shaking hands, and then I shall be the supernumerary, and shall have to spend the rest of the evening in listening to the rhapsodies of Monsieur Edmond Dantès, the captain, and in watching the amours of the beautiful Catalan with the sailor. That would be too much for me; and, with the worthy help of wine, the one would push gallantry to affectation and the other jealousy to fury.”\n\nDanglars was not mistaken; the two young men had accepted his invitation, and were walking arm-in-arm toward the table at which he sat, the one with the joyous step of a man who has attained the summit of his desires, the other with that slow and heavy tread which indicates a great internal struggle. It was evident that Fernand was suffering, and that the iron had entered into his soul. A gloomy look was in his eyes, and his lips were compressed into a thin line, while the slight quivering of their muscles showed plainly the bitter feelings that agitated him. Caderousse was still there, dead drunk.\n\n“Well, my friends,” said Edmond, without perceiving the coldness of his reception, “here I am, back again. Good-evening, Caderousse; good-evening, La Carconte; good-evening, Danglars.”\n\n“Good-evening, Edmond,” returned Danglars; “you are back, then? Well, I told Monsieur Morrel that you were an excellent fellow, and that he would have you back.”\n\n“Yes, I am back.”\n\n“You have lost no time, it seems.”\n\n“No, I wished to get back as quickly as possible to see my father and Mercédès.”\n\n“I am glad to see you are so happy, my dear friend,” said Danglars; “and you are going to stay with us now, are you?”\n\n“No, not yet.”\n\n“Not yet? Why, I thought you told us you obtained leave of absence.”\n\n“So I have; but it is for a purpose which I must keep secret for the present. To-morrow I must go to Paris.”\n\n“To Paris! Have you ever been to Paris?”\n\n“No, I have not; and I am afraid it will be a very long journey.”\n\n“You are right; but it is a very fine city, and you will see a great many things there.”\n\n“I shall see but one, and that is the object of my mission.”\n\nAs Edmond said this, he smiled; and Danglars, seeing that he was not inclined to be communicative, changed the conversation.\n\n“Monsieur Morrel,” said he, “tells me that you are appointed captain of the Pharaon.”\n\n“Ah, yes, he has done me that kindness.”\n\n“And when do you take the command?”\n\n“In a few days. But first I must go to Paris.”\n\n“Ah, yes, the secret mission. Well, I wish you success, my dear friend.”\n\n“Thank you.”\n\n“And when you come back, we will have a little fete, eh? To celebrate your promotion and your marriage.”\n\n“Ah,” said Edmond, smiling, “I must not forget to invite you to my wedding, Danglars.”\n\n“Oh, yes, we shall be there,” said Caderousse, who had roused himself a little; “we shall be there, and we will drink to your health and to the health of the beautiful Mercédès.”\n\n“Thank you, my friends,” said Edmond; “and now I must leave you, for I have a great deal to do.”\n\n“Stay a moment,” said Danglars; “you are not in such a hurry as that. You have time to drink a glass of wine with us.”\n\n“No, thank you; I must go and see my father, and then I have to make some preparations for my journey.”\n\n“Well, then, a pleasant journey to you,” said Danglars; “and be sure to come back soon.”\n\n“Oh, yes, I shall not be long away.”\n\nEdmond shook hands with Danglars and Caderousse, and then, with a nod to Fernand, who had not spoken a word, he left the inn, accompanied by Mercédès. As they went out, Danglars looked after them with a smile that was anything but amiable.\n\n“There,” said he, “goes a man who is on the high-road to fortune. If there were a revolution, it would be for such as he to be made president of the republic; but as there is not, he will be captain of the Pharaon. And that is not all; he is going to marry a beautiful girl, who, they say, is very rich.

They will soon be shaking hands, and then I shall be the supernumerary, and shall have to spend the rest of the evening in listening to the rhapsodies of Monsieur Edmond Dantès, the captain, and in watching the amours of the beautiful Catalan with the sailor. That would be too much for me; and, with the worthy help of wine, the one would push gallantry to affectation and the other jealousy to fury.”\n\nDanglars was not mistaken; the two young men had accepted his invitation, and were walking arm-in-arm toward the table at which he sat, the one with the joyous step of a man who has attained the summit of his desires, the other with that slow and heavy tread which indicates a great internal struggle. It was evident that Fernand was suffering, and that the iron had entered into his soul. A gloomy look was in his eyes, and his lips were compressed into a thin line, while the slight quivering of their muscles showed plainly the bitter feelings that agitated him. Caderousse was still there, dead drunk.\n\n“Well, my friends,” said Edmond, without perceiving the coldness of his reception, “here I am, back again. Good-evening, Caderousse; good-evening, La Carconte; good-evening, Danglars.”\n\n“Good-evening, Edmond,” returned Danglars; “you are back, then? Well, I told Monsieur Morrel that you were an excellent fellow, and that he would have you back.”\n\n“Yes, I am back.”\n\n“You have lost no time, it seems.”\n\n“No, I wished to get back as quickly as possible to see my father and Mercédès.”\n\n“I am glad to see you are so happy, my dear friend,” said Danglars; “and you are going to stay with us now, are you?”\n\n“No, not yet.”\n\n“Not yet? Why, I thought you told us you obtained leave of absence.”\n\n“So I have; but it is for a purpose which I must keep secret for the present. To-morrow I must go to Paris.”\n\n“To Paris! Have you ever been to Paris?”\n\n“No, I have not; and I am afraid it will be a very long journey.”\n\n“You are right; but it is a very fine city, and you will see a great many things there.”\n\n“I shall see but one, and that is the object of my mission.”\n\nAs Edmond said this, he smiled; and Danglars, seeing that he was not inclined to be communicative, changed the conversation.\n\n“Monsieur Morrel,” said he, “tells me that you are appointed captain of the Pharaon.”\n\n“Ah, yes, he has done me that kindness.”\n\n“And when do you take the command?”\n\n“In a few days. But first I must go to Paris.”\n\n“Ah, yes, the secret mission. Well, I wish you success, my dear friend.”\n\n“Thank you.”\n\n“And when you come back, we will have a little fete, eh? To celebrate your promotion and your marriage.”\n\n“Ah,” said Edmond, smiling, “I must not forget to invite you to my wedding, Danglars.”\n\n“Oh, yes, we shall be there,” said Caderousse, who had roused himself a little; “we shall be there, and we will drink to your health and to the health of the beautiful Mercédès.”\n\n“Thank you, my friends,” said Edmond; “and now I must leave you, for I have a great deal to do.”\n\n“Stay a moment,” said Danglars; “you are not in such a hurry as that. You have time to drink a glass of wine with us.”\n\n“No, thank you; I must go and see my father, and then I have to make some preparations for my journey.”\n\n“Well, then, a pleasant journey to you,” said Danglars; “and be sure to come back soon.”\n\n“Oh, yes, I shall not be long away.”\n\nEdmond shook hands with Danglars and Caderousse, and then, with a nod to Fernand, who had not spoken a word, he left the inn, accompanied by Mercédès. As they went out, Danglars looked after them with a smile that was anything but amiable.\n\n“There,” said he, “goes a man who is on the high-road to fortune. If there were a revolution, it would be for such as he to be made president of the republic; but as there is not, he will be captain of the Pharaon. And that is not all; he is going to marry a beautiful girl, who, they say, is very rich. Yes, yes, he is a lucky fellow.”\n\n“And I,” muttered Fernand, “I am a wretch.”\n\n“Bah,” said Danglars, “do not despair; you are young, and you have time to make your fortune.

Is it my affair? I am not in love with Mademoiselle Mercédès; but for you—in the words of the gospel, seek, and you shall find.”\n“I have found already.”\n“What?”\n“I would stab the man, but the woman told me that if any misfortune happened to her betrothed, she would kill herself.”\n“Pooh! Women say those things, but never do them.”\n“You do not know Mercédès; what she threatens she will do.”\n“Idiot!” muttered Danglars; “whether she kill herself or not, what matter, provided Dantès is not captain?”\n“Before Mercédès should die,” replied Fernand, with the accents of unshaken resolution, “I would die myself!”\n“That’s what I call love!” said Caderousse with a voice more tipsy than ever. “That’s love, or I don’t know what love is.”\n“Come,” said Danglars, “you appear to me a good sort of fellow, and hang me, I should like to help you, but——”\n“Yes,” said Caderousse, “but how?”\n“My dear fellow,” replied Danglars, “you are three parts drunk; finish the bottle, and you will be completely so. Drink then, and do not meddle with what we are discussing, for that requires all one’s wit and cool judgment.”\n“I—drunk!” said Caderousse; “well that’s a good one! I could drink four more such bottles; they are no bigger than cologne flasks. Père Pamphile, more wine!”\nAnd Caderousse rattled his glass upon the table.\n“You were saying, sir——” said Fernand, awaiting with great anxiety the end of this interrupted remark.\n“What was I saying? I forget. This drunken Caderousse has made me lose the thread of my sentence.”\n“Drunk, if you like; so much the worse for those who fear wine, for it is because they have bad thoughts which they are afraid the liquor will extract from their hearts;” and Caderousse began to sing the two last lines of a song very popular at the time:\n‘Tous les méchants sont buveurs d’eau;\nC’est bien prouvé par le déluge.’",

Danglars, ever the pragmatist and the true architect of malice, leaned forward, his face illuminated by the flickering lamp. “The means are simple, my friend,” he said, his voice a low, conspiratorial whisper. “Dantès carries a letter. A letter from the Isle of Elba. Addressed to the Bonapartist committee in Paris.”\n\nCaderousse, already half-drunk and uneasy, shifted on his stool. “A letter? What of it? It’s just a letter.”\n\n“Just a letter?” Danglars scoffed, a cruel smile playing on his lips. “In these times? With the King on the throne? A letter from Elba is treason, my dear Caderousse. High treason!” He paused, letting the weight of the word sink in. “If that letter were to fall into the wrong hands… say, the hands of the public prosecutor… Dantès would be arrested. Imprisoned. Perhaps even worse.”\n\nFernand’s eyes widened, a cruel hope dawning in them. “Arrested? But how? We can’t just take the letter.”\n\n“No, we don’t need to take it,” Danglars replied smoothly. “We need only inform the authorities of its existence and its destination. An anonymous denunciation.” He pulled a sheet of paper and a pen from his pocket. “It’s simple. A few lines. To the King’s attorney.

MAJOR STRUCTURAL ISSUES:\n- The completion omits a significant portion of the original passage, particularly the entire section where a plan is enacted involving writing a denunciation letter. The act of writing, the method used, and the content of the letter are all missing.\n- The completion invents speculative dialogue about Dantès' fate (being dead, lost at sea, or kept in prison), which does not appear in the original at this point.\n\n2. MISSING ELEMENTS:\n- The completion lacks the detailed description of the plan to write the denunciation letter, including the specific method of disguising handwriting.\n- The actual content of the letter, which is a crucial part of the original passage, is not included.\n- The process of addressing and folding the letter, as well as the final remarks about the plan being settled, are missing.\n\n3. INACCURATE ELEMENTS:\n- The sequence of events is altered: the completion introduces speculative outcomes for Dantès before the plan to write the letter is even discussed, disrupting the original order.\n- There is an inaccurate portrayal of Fernand's response, focusing on hypothetical outcomes rather than the emotional or practical concerns present in the original.\n- The completion attributes certain lines and perspectives to the wrong characters, and introduces invented dialogue not found in the source material."

Certainly neither I nor Fernand,” said Danglars, rising and looking at the young man, who still remained seated, but whose eye was fixed on the denunciatory sheet of paper flung into the corner.\n“In this case,” replied Caderousse, “let’s have some more wine. I wish to drink to the health of Edmond and the lovely Mercédès.”\n“You have had too much already, drunkard,” said Danglars; “and if you continue, you will be compelled to sleep here, because unable to stand on your legs.”\n“I?” said Caderousse, rising with all the offended dignity of a drunken man, “I can’t keep on my legs? Why, I’ll wager I can go up into the belfry of the Accoules, and without staggering, too!”\n“Done!” said Danglars, “I’ll take your bet; but tomorrow—today it is time to return. Give me your arm, and let us go.”\n“Very well, let us go,” said Caderousse; “but I don’t want your arm at all. Come, Fernand, won’t you return to Marseilles with us?”\n“No,” said Fernand; “I shall return to the Catalans.”\n“You’re wrong. Come with us to Marseilles—come along.”\n“I will not.”\n“What do you mean? you will not? Well, just as you like, my prince; there’s liberty for all the world. Come along, Danglars, and let the young gentleman return to the Catalans if he chooses.”\nDanglars took advantage of Caderousse’s temper at the moment, to take him off towards Marseilles by the Porte Saint-Victor, staggering as he went.\nWhen they had advanced about twenty yards, Danglars looked back and saw Fernand stoop, pick up the crumpled paper, and putting it into his pocket then rush out of the arbor towards Pillon.\n“Well,” said Caderousse, “why, what a lie he told! He said he was going to the Catalans, and he is going to the city. Hallo, Fernand! You are coming, my boy!”\n“Oh, you don’t see straight,” said Danglars; “he’s gone right by the road to the Vieilles Infirmeries.”\n“Well,” said Caderousse, “I should have sworn that he turned to the right—how treacherous wine is!”\n“Come, come,” said Danglars to himself, “now the thing is at work and it will effect its purpose unassisted.”",

Danglars smiled thinly, a cold, calculating gleam in his eyes that belied the feigned indifference he attempted to project. Fernand, his face pale and drawn with jealousy, felt a surge of savage triumph. This was it. This was the end of the sailor who dared to love Mercédès. He said nothing, but his clenched fists and the tremor in his lip spoke volumes of the dark satisfaction that filled him.  Danglars, ever the pragmatist, folded the letter carefully. “Well, that’s a serious matter,” he said, his voice unnaturally calm. “One must be careful with such accusations. But if they are true…” He let the sentence hang in the air, a veiled threat, a promise of ruin.  Caderousse, however, seemed to shrink back, the initial bravado draining away as the reality of their action settled upon him. He had been drunk, easily swayed, but now, sobered by the gravity of the denunciation, a flicker of fear, perhaps even remorse, crossed his features. “But… but what if it’s not true?” he stammered. “What if Edmond is innocent?”  Danglars shot him a sharp look. “Innocent or not, the accusation is made. And in times like these, accusations from the right quarters carry weight.” He was already thinking of how to ensure the letter reached the public prosecutor, how to add a subtle nudge here or there to guarantee its effect. Fernand, meanwhile, was lost in his own dark reverie, picturing Mercédès weeping, turning to him for comfort after Dantès was gone.  They dispersed shortly after, the air thick with unspoken complicity and the heavy weight of the deed they had just set in motion. The betrothal feast was to be held that evening at Dantès’ father’s humble dwelling. Joy and anticipation filled the small house, oblivious to the storm gathering on the horizon. As the guests celebrated, raising glasses to the happy couple, a heavy knock sounded at the door. Two gendarmes stood on the threshold, their presence casting a pall over the festivities.  “Edmond Dantès?” the senior officer inquired, his voice formal and stern.  Dantès, bewildered, stepped forward, his smile fading. “That is I.”  “Edmond Dantès,” the officer repeated, “in the name of the law, I arrest you.”  A gasp went through the room. Mercédès cried out, rushing to his side. His father looked on in horror, his face turning ashen. Dantès, utterly stunned, could only stammer, “Arrest me? Why? What have I done?”  The officer offered no explanation, merely stating, “You will be informed. Come with us.”  As Dantès was led away, torn from the arms of his distraught fiancée and the embrace of his weeping father, he caught a glimpse of faces in the crowd – some shocked, some pitying, and among"

And although the entertainment was fixed for twelve o’clock, an hour previous to that time the balcony was filled with impatient and expectant guests, consisting of the favored part of the crew of the Pharaon, and other personal friends of the bridegroom, the whole of whom had arrayed themselves in their choicest costumes, in order to do greater honor to the occasion.\nVarious rumors were afloat to the effect that the owners of the Pharaon had promised to attend the nuptial feast; but all seemed unanimous in doubting that an act of such rare and exceeding condescension could possibly be intended.\nDanglars, however, who now made his appearance, accompanied by Caderousse, effectually confirmed the report, stating that he had recently conversed with M. Morrel, who had himself assured him of his intention to dine at La Réserve.\nIn fact, a moment later M. Morrel appeared and was saluted with an enthusiastic burst of applause from the crew of the Pharaon, who hailed the visit of the shipowner as a sure indication that the man whose wedding feast he thus delighted to honor would ere long be first in command of the ship; and as Dantès was universally beloved on board his vessel, the sailors put no restraint on their tumultuous joy at finding that the opinion and choice of their superiors so exactly coincided with their own.\nWith the entrance of M.

His thin but wiry legs were arrayed in a pair of richly embroidered clocked stockings, evidently of English manufacture, while from his three-cornered hat depended a long streaming knot of white and blue ribbons. Thus he came along, supporting himself on a curiously carved stick, his aged countenance lit up with happiness, looking for all the world like one of the aged dandies of 1796, parading the newly opened gardens of the Luxembourg and Tuileries.\nBeside him glided Caderousse, whose desire to partake of the good things provided for the wedding party had induced him to become reconciled to the Dantès, father and son, although there still lingered in his mind a faint and unperfect recollection of the events of the preceding night; just as the brain retains on waking in the morning the dim and misty outline of a dream.\nAs Danglars approached the disappointed lover, he cast on him a look of deep meaning, while Fernand, as he slowly paced behind the happy pair, who seemed, in their own unmixed content, to have entirely forgotten that such a being as himself existed, was pale and abstracted; occasionally, however, a deep flush would overspread his countenance, and a nervous contraction distort his features, while, with an agitated and restless gaze, he would glance in the direction of Marseilles, like one who either anticipated or foresaw some great and important event.\nDantès himself was simply, but becomingly, clad in the dress peculiar to the merchant service—a costume somewhat between a military and a civil garb; and with his fine countenance, radiant with joy and happiness, a more perfect specimen of manly beauty could scarcely be imagined.\nLovely as the Greek girls of Cyprus or Chios, Mercédès boasted the same bright flashing eyes of jet, and ripe, round, coral lips. She moved with the light, free step of an Arlesienne or an Andalusian. One more practiced in the arts of great cities would have hid her blushes beneath a veil, or, at least, have cast down her thickly fringed lashes, so as to have concealed the liquid lustre of her animated eyes; but, on the contrary, the delighted girl looked around her with a smile that seemed to say: “If you are my friends, rejoice with me, for I am very happy.”",

Edmond and Mercédès were the two most supremely happy beings in the world. They had forgotten everything—the brigantine, the voyage, the delay, past fears, and future dangers; to them the sun shone brighter than it ever had before; and the sky appeared more radiant. In the midst of their happiness they had not even noticed the gloom that pervaded Fernand’s countenance, which the young Catalane attributed to the usual effect of either jealousy or self-interest. Danglars and Caderousse saluted the bridal party. “Well,” said Dantès, “you see we are punctual.” “Oh! a little behind time, but that matters little,” replied Danglars, “in the country we are not so particular to a few minutes. Here is the order of arrest.” “The order of arrest!” said Dantès, his brow darkening. “Yes, for the captain of the Pharaon.” “For Captain Leclere?” “Yes, but it appears he is dead.” “Alas! yes,” said Dantès, “he died in my arms.” “Then the order is of no use,” said Danglars, “since the captain is dead. Give it to me, Caderousse, and I will throw it into the sea.” “No,” said Caderousse, “you had better give it to the inspector of the customs; it may be of some service to him.” “Very true,” said Danglars, and he put the paper into his pocket. “And now,” said Dantès, “let us go on, for the hour of the marriage is fixed, and we must not be too late.” “To be sure,” said Danglars, “let us go on.” And the two friends, or rather the two companions, for friendship is a sacred thing, and not to be profaned by such as they, joined the bridal party, and walked side by side with old Dantès.

The two conspirators exchanged a quick, furtive glance. Their plan was about to unfold before their very eyes. They slowed their pace, affecting an air of casualness as the joyous procession drew nearer. Mercédès, radiant in her bridal attire, leaned on Dantès’ arm, her face alight with happiness. Old Dantès, though frail, walked with a proud step, his eyes beaming upon his son. The young girls giggled and chatted, their voices adding to the festive atmosphere. Fernand trailed behind, his gaze fixed on Mercédès with a look of bitter longing that quickly morphed into a look of anticipation as he saw Danglars and Caderousse. As the two groups met, greetings were exchanged, forced on one side, genuinely cheerful on the other. Dantès, unsuspecting, smiled warmly at his shipmates. “Ah, Danglars, Caderousse! You are coming to join us? Excellent!” he exclaimed. Danglars managed a strained smile. “Alas, Edmond, we were just… on an errand.” Caderousse grunted in agreement. Just as Dantès was about to inquire further, a sudden commotion arose at the end of the street. A detachment of gendarmes, led by a sergeant, was rapidly approaching. The festive mood instantly evaporated, replaced by a ripple of apprehension. The gendarmes stopped directly before the wedding party. The sergeant, a stern-faced man, looked around, his eyes scanning the faces. “Which of you is called Edmond Dantès?” he demanded in a loud, official voice. A stunned silence fell over the group. Dantès, though bewildered, stepped forward. “I am he,” he replied, his voice steady but questioning. The sergeant nodded curtly. “Edmond Dantès, I arrest you in the name of the law.” Mercédès gasped, her hand flying to her mouth. Old Dantès cried out, “Arrest? My son? For what crime?” The young girls huddled together, frightened. Fernand’s smile widened almost imperceptibly. Danglars and Caderousse exchanged another glance, this one filled with triumph. “There must be some mistake!” Mercédès cried, clinging to Dantès’ arm. “Edmond has done nothing wrong!” The sergeant remained impassive. “We have orders. He is accused of treason.” Treason! The word struck like a thunderbolt. Dantès himself paled slightly, though his eyes flashed with indignation. “Treason? This is impossible! I am a loyal Frenchman!” “You will have the opportunity to explain yourself,” the sergeant said, gesturing to two gendarmes. “Come with us.” They moved to take Dantès by the arms. Mercédès threw herself between them and her betrothed. “No! You cannot take him! He is innocent!” Her pleas were ignored. Dantès gently but firmly disengaged himself from her grasp. “Mercédès, my love, do not despair. This is a misunderstanding. I will clear my name and return to you.” He kissed her forehead, then turned to his father. “Father, do not worry. I will be back soon.” Old Dantès could only look on, tears streaming down his face. Danglars and Caderousse watched, feigning shock and concern, muttering condolences. Fernand stood slightly apart, a picture of false sympathy, his eyes gleaming with malicious satisfaction. Dantès was led away, the gendarmes flanking him. He cast one last look back at Mercédès, whose heartbroken cries echoed in the street, and at his father, who seemed to shrink before his eyes. The joyous procession had dissolved into a scene of utter desolation, the bright promise of the morning shattered by the dark hand of betrayal."

Morrel descended and came forth to meet it, followed by the soldiers and sailors there assembled, to whom he had repeated the promise already given, that Dantès should be the successor to the late Captain Leclere. Edmond, at the approach of his patron, respectfully placed the arm of his affianced bride within that of M. Morrel, who, forthwith conducting her up the flight of wooden steps leading to the chamber in which the feast was prepared, was gayly followed by the guests, beneath whose heavy tread the slight structure creaked and groaned for the space of several minutes.\n“Father,” said Mercédès, stopping when she had reached the centre of the table, “sit, I pray you, on my right hand; on my left I will place him who has ever been as a brother to me,” pointing with a soft and gentle smile to Fernand; but her words and look seemed to inflict the direst torture on him, for his lips became ghastly pale, and even beneath the dark hue of his complexion the blood might be seen retreating as though some sudden pang drove it back to the heart.\nDuring this time, Dantès, at the opposite side of the table, had been occupied in similarly placing his most honored guests. M. Morrel was seated at his right hand, Danglars at his left; while, at a sign from Edmond, the rest of the company ranged themselves as they found it most agreeable.\nThen they began to pass around the dusky, piquant, Arlesian sausages, and lobsters in their dazzling red cuirasses, prawns of large size and brilliant color, the echinus with its prickly outside and dainty morsel within, the clovis, esteemed by the epicures of the South as more than rivalling the exquisite flavor of the oyster, North. All the delicacies, in fact, that are cast up by the wash of waters on the sandy beach, and styled by the grateful fishermen “fruits of the sea.”\n“A pretty silence truly!” said the old father of the bridegroom, as he carried to his lips a glass of wine of the hue and brightness of the topaz, and which had just been placed before Mercédès herself. “Now, would anybody think that this room contained a happy, merry party, who desire nothing better than to laugh and dance the hours away?”\n“Ah,” sighed Caderousse, “a man cannot always feel happy because he is about to be married.”\n“The truth is,” replied Dantès, “that I am too happy for noisy mirth; if that is what you meant by your observation, my worthy friend, you are right; joy takes a strange effect at times, it seems to oppress us almost the same as sorrow.”\nDanglars looked towards Fernand, whose excitable nature received and betrayed each fresh impression.\n“Why, what ails you?” asked he of Edmond. “Do you fear any approaching evil? I should say that you were the happiest man alive at this instant.”\n“And that is the very thing that alarms me,” returned Dantès. “Man does not appear to me to be intended to enjoy felicity so unmixed; happiness is like the enchanted palaces we read of in our childhood, where fierce, fiery dragons defend the entrance and approach; and monsters of all shapes and kinds, requiring to be overcome ere victory is ours. I own that I am lost in wonder to find myself promoted to an honor of which I feel myself unworthy—that of being the husband of Mercédès.”\n“Nay, nay!” cried Caderousse, smiling, “you have not attained that honor yet. Mercédès is not yet your wife. Just assume the tone and manner of a husband, and see how she will remind you that your hour is not yet come!”\nThe bride blushed, while Fernand, restless and uneasy, seemed to start at every fresh sound, and from time to time wiped away the large drops of perspiration that gathered on his brow.\n“Well, never mind that, neighbor Caderousse; it is not worthwhile to contradict me for such a trifle as that. ’Tis true that Mercédès is not actually my wife; but,” added he, drawing out his watch, “in an hour and a half she will be.”\nA general exclamation of surprise ran round the table, with the exception of the elder Dantès, whose laugh displayed the still perfect beauty of his large white teeth. Mercédès looked pleased and gratified, while Fernand grasped the handle of his knife with a convulsive clutch.\n“In an hour?” inquired Danglars, turning pale. “How is that, my friend?”\n“Why, thus it is,” replied Dantès. “Thanks to the influence of M. Morrel, to whom, next to my father, I owe every blessing I enjoy, every difficulty has been removed. We have purchased permission to waive the usual delay; and at half-past two o’clock the Mayor of Marseilles will be waiting for us at the city hall. Now, as a quarter-past one has already struck, I do not consider I have asserted too much in saying, that, in another hour and thirty minutes Mercédès will have become Madame Dantès.”",

I say this without any wish to injure his memory.” “In truth,” added Caderousse, who was beginning to feel the effects of the wine, “Captain Leclere was not a bad man, but he was not a sailor; and I, who have been a sailor these twenty years, can tell you that.” “Hold your tongue, Caderousse,” said Dantès, smiling; “you are drunk.” “No,” replied Caderousse, “I am not drunk; but if I were, it would be with joy at seeing my friend Edmond become a captain.” “We will drink to his health,” said M.

We must find a captain.” “I have found one,” said M. Dantès. “You?” said Danglars, surprised. “Yes, I,” replied Dantès. “And who is he?” asked Danglars. “It is I,” replied Dantès. “You?” cried Danglars, turning pale. “Yes, I,” repeated Dantès. “M.

Morrel’s influence had removed all obstacles, allowing them to waive the usual waiting period, and the Mayor would marry them at half-past two.",

                "text": "As soon as the bridal party came in sight of La Réserve, M. Morrel descended and came forth to meet it, followed by the soldiers and sailors there assembled, to whom he had repeated the promise already given, that Dantès should be the successor to the late Captain Leclere. Edmond, radiant with joy, respectfully requested Mercédès to take M. Morrel’s arm, and the latter, repeating to the bride the same words he had used to the bridegroom, conducted her to the dining-room on the first floor, the windows of which looked out upon the sea. The apartment was spacious and airy, and was soon filled with the friends from the Allées de Meilhan, with whom Dantès was intimately acquainted, and the sailors of the Pharaon, his comrades, who had been invited in a body. In a very short time, the room was full of guests, and a joyous tumult reigned, in the midst of which Caderousse, drunk, or nearly so, was distinguishing himself by shouting at the top of his voice. Old Dantès was seated at the right of the bride, and Fernand, pale and trembling, at her left; and Mercédès, who divined by the instinct of woman all the sorrow that Fernand endured, made room for him by her side, saying, “You, Fernand, my brother, will be on my left.” This gesture, this mark of consideration, which in the eyes of the guests appeared only an amiable attention, was on the part of Mercédès a sublime piece of charity, and on the part of Fernand a terrible torment, for it reminded him that Mercédès considered him as a brother, and that she was about to separate herself from him by an abyss. Dantès took his place between M. Morrel and Danglars. The rest of the guests ranged themselves as they pleased. In an instant, all were seated. The feast commenced. It was a repast worthy of the occasion, and the guests did honour to it. There were all sorts of fish, from the largest to the smallest, dressed in a hundred different ways; there were lobsters, crabs, oysters, and other shell-fish, of which the abundance and variety proved that the sea was determined to do honour to the marriage of one of its children. Old Dantès, holding a glass of wine in his hand, and which he had not yet tasted, turned to Mercédès, and said, with a smile, “It is a fine day, my child, and I am very happy; but it seems to me that we are very silent for a wedding-feast.” “It is true,” said Caderousse, “we are very silent. But what would you have? When a man is about to marry, he is not always gay.” “That is true,” said Dantès; “but when he is about to marry Mercédès, he is too happy to be gay; he is absorbed in his happiness.” “Ah, my friend,” said Danglars, looking at Fernand, who was devouring Mercédès with his eyes, “you are right; you are too happy to be gay. But you should be gay, nevertheless. You are the happiest man in the world.” “And yet,” said Edmond, “I am not gay. There are times when I think that I am too happy.” “Indeed,” said Danglars, “you are too happy?” “Yes,” replied Edmond; “it seems to me that happiness like mine is not natural, and that it must be paid for by some great misfortune. I am like a man who has built his house on the side of a volcano; he is always afraid that the volcano will erupt.” “That is a foolish idea,” said M. Morrel. “You are too happy, my friend, and you are afraid of being too happy. That is all.” “No,” said Edmond, “it is not that. I am afraid of losing Mercédès. I am afraid that something will happen to separate us.” “That is a foolish idea,” said M. Morrel. “Nothing will happen to separate you. You love each other, and you are about to be married. That is all.” “Yes,” said Edmond, “that is all. But it seems to me that it is too much.” “Come, come,” said Caderousse, “do not be so melancholy. You are going to be married, and that is all that you should think of.” “You are right, Caderousse,” said Edmond. “I am going to be married, and I will think of nothing else.” “That is right,” said Caderousse. “And when are you going to be married?” “In an hour and a half,” replied Edmond, pulling out his watch. This news caused general surprise, except for old Dantès, who laughed delightedly. Mercédès looked pleased, while Fernand gripped his knife convulsively.

MAJOR STRUCTURAL ISSUES:\n- The completion invents several scenes and conversations not present in the original, such as extended dialogue about business, the Pharaon's sailing schedule, and a discussion about finding a captain. These invented sections occur in the middle of the passage and disrupt the original sequence of events.\n- The completion omits the detailed description of the food and the festive atmosphere that is a significant part of the original passage.\n\n2. MISSING ELEMENTS:\n- Early in the passage, the completion does not include the specific actions and arrangements as the bridal party enters and ascends to the feast, nor the sensory details about the setting and the guests' movement.\n- The middle section lacks the exchange where Mercédès addresses her father and Fernand, and the emotional reactions of Fernand to her words.\n- The completion skips the detailed listing of the delicacies served at the feast, which is a notable descriptive element in the original.\n- The latter part omits the nuanced conversation about happiness, the nature of joy, and the philosophical reflections exchanged between Dantès, Caderousse, and Danglars.\n- The completion does not include the specific time references and the explanation of how the wedding will proceed, as well as the reactions of the various characters to this news.\n\n3. INACCURATE ELEMENTS:\n- The sequence of events is altered, with invented business discussions inserted before the announcement of the wedding timing, which does not match the original order.\n- The completion attributes actions and dialogue to characters that do not align with the original, such as M. Dantès announcing himself as captain and the extended business talk.\n- Emotional responses and character interactions, especially those involving Fernand and Mercédès, are inaccurately portrayed or missing, leading to a loss of the original's tension and atmosphere.\n- The completion condenses and simplifies the explanation of the wedding arrangements, omitting the specific time details and the process by which the delay was waived."

Arrived here only yesterday morning, and married today at three o’clock! Commend me to a sailor for going the quick way to work!”\n“But,” asked Danglars, in a timid tone, “how did you manage about the other formalities—the contract—the settlement?”\n“The contract,” answered Dantès, laughingly, “it didn’t take long to fix that. Mercédès has no fortune; I have none to settle on her. So, you see, our papers were quickly written out, and certainly do not come very expensive.” This joke elicited a fresh burst of applause.\n“So that what we presumed to be merely the betrothal feast turns out to be the actual wedding dinner!” said Danglars.\n“No, no,” answered Dantès; “don’t imagine I am going to put you off in that shabby manner. Tomorrow morning I start for Paris; four days to go, and the same to return, with one day to discharge the commission entrusted to me, is all the time I shall be absent. I shall be back here by the first of March, and on the second I give my real marriage feast.”\nThis prospect of fresh festivity redoubled the hilarity of the guests to such a degree, that the elder Dantès, who, at the commencement of the repast, had commented upon the silence that prevailed, now found it difficult, amid the general din of voices, to obtain a moment’s tranquillity in which to drink to the health and prosperity of the bride and bridegroom.\nDantès, perceiving the affectionate eagerness of his father, responded by a look of grateful pleasure; while Mercédès glanced at the clock and made an expressive gesture to Edmond.\nAround the table reigned that noisy hilarity which usually prevails at such a time among people sufficiently free from the demands of social position not to feel the trammels of etiquette. Such as at the commencement of the repast had not been able to seat themselves according to their inclination rose unceremoniously, and sought out more agreeable companions. Everybody talked at once, without waiting for a reply and each one seemed to be contented with expressing his or her own thoughts.\nFernand’s paleness appeared to have communicated itself to Danglars. As for Fernand himself, he seemed to be enduring the tortures of the damned; unable to rest, he was among the first to quit the table, and, as though seeking to avoid the hilarious mirth that rose in such deafening sounds, he continued, in utter silence, to pace the farther end of the salon.\nCaderousse approached him just as Danglars, whom Fernand seemed most anxious to avoid, had joined him in a corner of the room.\n“Upon my word,” said Caderousse, from whose mind the friendly treatment of Dantès, united with the effect of the excellent wine he had partaken of, had effaced every feeling of envy or jealousy at Dantès’ good fortune,—“upon my word, Dantès is a downright good fellow, and when I see him sitting there beside his pretty wife that is so soon to be. I cannot help thinking it would have been a great pity to have served him that trick you were planning yesterday.”\n“Oh, there was no harm meant,” answered Danglars; “at first I certainly did feel somewhat uneasy as to what Fernand might be tempted to do; but when I saw how completely he had mastered his feelings, even so far as to become one of his rival’s attendants, I knew there was no further cause for apprehension.” Caderousse looked full at Fernand—he was ghastly pale.\n“Certainly,” continued Danglars, “the sacrifice was no trifling one, when the beauty of the bride is concerned. Upon my soul, that future captain of mine is a lucky dog! Gad! I only wish he would let me take his place.”\n“Shall we not set forth?” asked the sweet, silvery voice of Mercédès; “two o’clock has just struck, and you know we are expected in a quarter of an hour.”\n“To be sure!—to be sure!” cried Dantès, eagerly quitting the table; “let us go directly!”\nHis words were re-echoed by the whole party, with vociferous cheers.\nAt this moment Danglars, who had been incessantly observing every change in Fernand’s look and manner, saw him stagger and fall back, with an almost convulsive spasm, against a seat placed near one of the open windows. At the same instant his ear caught a sort of indistinct sound on the stairs, followed by the measured tread of soldiery, with the clanking of swords and military accoutrements; then came a hum and buzz as of many voices, so as to deaden even the noisy mirth of the bridal party, among whom a vague feeling of curiosity and apprehension quelled every disposition to talk, and almost instantaneously the most deathlike stillness prevailed.",

To make a fortune, to enter the service, to marry a beautiful girl, and all in a few hours! It is miraculous.” “Ah, father,” said Edmond, smiling, “I have been a long time wishing for it.” “So,” said Danglars, in a hesitating tone, “the formalities will be proceeded with?” “Yes,” replied Dantès, “as soon as possible.” “And the contract?” said Danglars; “there must be one, I suppose?” “Certainly, there must,” said Dantès; “and it shall be drawn up and signed this very evening.” “Then,” said Danglars, “the betrothal feast may be considered the marriage feast?” “No,” said Dantès; “not exactly. I must go to Paris.” “To Paris! Really, to Paris?” said Danglars. “Yes, I am compelled to go on a journey for the service of the ship.” “And when will you be back?” asked Mercédès, anxiously. “By the 2nd of March, at the latest, my dear Mercédès.” “Oh, yes,” said old Dantès; “and we will have the wedding then, and a grand one it shall be!” “So be it,” said Dantès; “my worthy father. So then, the 2nd of March. I promise you.” This promise of a wedding feast in the future only increased the merriment of the guests, and it was with difficulty that old Dantès could propose the health of the bride and bridegroom, so much were the company absorbed in anticipations of the feast. Dantès saw the eagerness of his father, and the grateful look which Mercédès cast upon him, and felt himself supreme in happiness. The boisterous mirth of the company, who with the liberty of old friends made themselves quite at home, seemed to increase every moment; and whilst Caderousse, with a voice hoarse with wine, sang a drinking song, and the old father, with a beaming countenance, acknowledged the felicitations of his friends, Mercédès, with a smile full of perfect happiness, met the congratulatory glances of the women. Fernand alone sat in silent agony. He had yielded to the entreaties of Mercédès that he would remain, and in a corner of the room, with his arms crossed, and his head bowed down, he had remained since the announcement of the wedding, a prey to the most bitter reflections. He was roused from them by the voice of Caderousse, who, with a glass in his hand, and somewhat unsteady in his gait, approached him. “Well, Fernand,” said he, “why don’t you drink the health of the bride and bridegroom?” Fernand looked up, but did not answer. “Come, come,” said Caderousse, “don’t be downhearted; it is all for the best.” “Yes,” said Danglars, who had followed Caderousse, “it is all for the best. What would you have? It is fate.” “Fate!” cried Fernand, with a bitter laugh. “Yes, fate,” said Danglars; “and a lucky fate too, for Edmond. He is a lucky fellow.” “And Mercédès is a beautiful girl,” said Caderousse; “and she will make him a good wife.” “Yes,” said Danglars; “and she is rich too, or will be, which is the same thing.” “Rich!” said Fernand; “Mercédès rich! What do you mean?” “Why, her father is dead,” said Danglars, “and she has inherited all his property.” “Indeed!” said Fernand, with a start. “Yes,” said Danglars; “and it is a good deal too.” “So much the better,” said Caderousse; “it is a good match for Edmond.” “Yes,” said Danglars; “and he deserves it. He is a brave fellow.” “And he is a good fellow too,” said Caderousse; “and he has been very kind to me.” “Ah, yes,” said Danglars; “he is a good fellow. But come, let us drink to his health.” “To his health!” said Caderousse; “and to his happiness!” “To his happiness!” repeated Danglars. They drank, and then Caderousse, turning to Fernand, said, “Come, Fernand, drink with us.” Fernand took the glass which Caderousse offered him, and raised it to his lips, but his hand trembled so violently that he spilled the wine. “Never mind,” said Caderousse; “it is a good omen.” “Yes,” said Danglars; “it is a good omen. But come, let us go and join the others.” They left Fernand to his reflections, and went to join the rest of the company. Mercédès had just risen, and was about to leave the room, when Danglars approached her. “Mademoiselle Mercédès,” said he, “allow me to congratulate you.” “Thank you, monsieur,” said Mercédès. “You are a lucky woman,” said Danglars. “I think so,” said Mercédès, with a smile. “And Edmond is a lucky fellow,” said Danglars. “He is indeed,” said Mercédès. “But come,” said she, “it is time for us to go.” “Yes,” said Dantès; “it is time.” And the whole party rose, and were about to leave the room, when a loud noise",

The Count of Monte Cristo had just concluded a brief, almost casual, anecdote concerning his time in the East, delivered with such effortless charm and profound knowledge that it had captivated every guest. Now, as the polite applause and murmurs of admiration subsided, Fernand opened his eyes, fixing them upon the man who sat opposite him, the man who was the source of his sudden, paralyzing terror. It was he. There was no longer any doubt. The features, refined by time and travel, the piercing gaze, the calm, almost unnerving self-possession – it was Edmond Dantès. Resurrected from the grave of the Château d’If, returned from the oblivion to which Fernand himself had consigned him. A cold sweat broke out on Fernand’s forehead, mingling with the burning sensation. How was this possible? He had seen the letter, signed by Danglars and himself, denouncing Dantès as a Bonapartist agent. He knew Dantès had been arrested on his wedding day. He had heard nothing of him since, save the vague rumors that prisoners at the Château d’If simply vanished. And now, here he was, not a broken, vengeful spectre, but a man of immense wealth, influence, and chilling composure, hosting them all in his opulent Parisian mansion. The irony was a bitter poison in Fernand’s throat. He, the Comte de Morcerf, peer of France, husband of Mercédès, father of Albert, owed his entire life, his title, his fortune, to the destruction of this man. And this man was now looking at him, not with overt hatred, but with an unnerving, almost scientific curiosity, as if observing a specimen under a microscope. Fernand forced himself to breathe, to unclench his hands which had tightened into fists on his knees beneath the table. He glanced around the table, seeking some sign that others saw what he saw, felt what he felt. But the other guests were still buzzing with admiration for the Count, discussing his travels, his collections, his enigmatic past. They saw only the fascinating, wealthy host, the man who had taken Paris by storm. They did not see the ghost of a sailor from Marseille. His eyes fell upon Mercédès, seated further down the table, her face pale and drawn, her gaze fixed on the Count with an intensity that mirrored his own terror, yet held a deeper, more profound sorrow. She knew too. Of course, she knew. The recognition in her eyes was unmistakable, a silent scream across the table that only the three of them could hear. Her distress amplified Fernand’s own. If Mercédès, who had loved Dantès so deeply, was so visibly affected, what hope did he, the betrayer, have? He tried to catch her eye, to send a silent plea for composure, for denial, but she seemed lost in her own private agony. The Count’s voice cut through the air, calm and measured, addressing the table generally but his eyes seemed to linger on Fernand for a fraction of a second longer than on anyone else. “Monsieur le Comte de Morcerf,” the Count said, his tone polite, almost deferential, “you have travelled extensively, I believe? Particularly in Spain and Algeria?” The question was innocuous, yet it struck Fernand like a physical blow. His military campaigns, his rise to power, were built on foundations he preferred not to examine too closely, particularly the circumstances surrounding the death of Ali Pasha and the acquisition of his fortune – events that had occurred after Dantès’s imprisonment. Was this a coincidence? Or did the Count know? Fernand’s mind raced. He managed a stiff nod. “Yes, Monsieur le Comte. I have.” His voice sounded strained"

          "text_segment": "The sounds drew nearer. Three blows were struck upon the panel of the door. The company looked at each other in consternation.\n“I demand admittance,” said a loud voice outside the room, “in the name of the law!” As no attempt was made to prevent it, the door was opened, and a magistrate, wearing his official scarf, presented himself, followed by four soldiers and a corporal. Uneasiness now yielded to the most extreme dread on the part of those present.\n“May I venture to inquire the reason of this unexpected visit?” said M. Morrel, addressing the magistrate, whom he evidently knew; “there is doubtless some mistake easily explained.”\n“If it be so,” replied the magistrate, “rely upon every reparation being made; meanwhile, I am the bearer of an order of arrest, and although I most reluctantly perform the task assigned me, it must, nevertheless, be fulfilled. Who among the persons here assembled answers to the name of Edmond Dantès?”\nEvery eye was turned towards the young man who, spite of the agitation he could not but feel, advanced with dignity, and said, in a firm voice:\n“I am he; what is your pleasure with me?”\n“Edmond Dantès,” replied the magistrate, “I arrest you in the name of the law!”\n“Me!” repeated Edmond, slightly changing color, “and wherefore, I pray?”\n“I cannot inform you, but you will be duly acquainted with the reasons that have rendered such a step necessary at the preliminary examination.”\nM. Morrel felt that further resistance or remonstrance was useless. He saw before him an officer delegated to enforce the law, and perfectly well knew that it would be as unavailing to seek pity from a magistrate decked with his official scarf, as to address a petition to some cold marble effigy. Old Dantès, however, sprang forward. There are situations which the heart of a father or a mother cannot be made to understand. He prayed and supplicated in terms so moving, that even the officer was touched, and, although firm in his duty, he kindly said, “My worthy friend, let me beg of you to calm your apprehensions. Your son has probably neglected some prescribed form or attention in registering his cargo, and it is more than probable he will be set at liberty directly he has given the information required, whether touching the health of his crew, or the value of his freight.”\n“What is the meaning of all this?” inquired Caderousse, frowningly, of Danglars, who had assumed an air of utter surprise.\n“How can I tell you?” replied he; “I am, like yourself, utterly bewildered at all that is going on, and cannot in the least make out what it is about.” Caderousse then looked around for Fernand, but he had disappeared.\nThe scene of the previous night now came back to his mind with startling clearness. The painful catastrophe he had just witnessed appeared effectually to have rent away the veil which the intoxication of the evening before had raised between himself and his memory.\n“So, so,” said he, in a hoarse and choking voice, to Danglars, “this, then, I suppose, is a part of the trick you were concerting yesterday? All I can say is, that if it be so, ’tis an ill turn, and well deserves to bring double evil on those who have projected it.”\n“Nonsense,” returned Danglars, “I tell you again I have nothing whatever to do with it; besides, you know very well that I tore the paper to pieces.”\n“No, you did not!” answered Caderousse, “you merely threw it by—I saw it lying in a corner.”\n“Hold your tongue, you fool!—what should you know about it?—why, you were drunk!”\n“Where is Fernand?” inquired Caderousse.\n“How do I know?” replied Danglars; “gone, as every prudent man ought to be, to look after his own affairs, most likely. Never mind where he is, let you and I go and see what is to be done for our poor friends.”\nDuring this conversation, Dantès, after having exchanged a cheerful shake of the hand with all his sympathizing friends, had surrendered himself to the officer sent to arrest him, merely saying, “Make yourselves quite easy, my good fellows, there is some little mistake to clear up, that’s all, depend upon it; and very likely I may not have to go so far as the prison to effect that.”\n“Oh, to be sure!” responded Danglars, who had now approached the group, “nothing more than a mistake, I feel quite certain.”\nDantès descended the staircase, preceded by the magistrate, and followed by the soldiers.",

Three knocks were heard at the door, and the guests looked at each other in consternation. “Is there any one who is not at home?” asked M. Morrel. “There is no one,” replied Caderousse; “we are all here.” In spite of this assurance, the knocks were repeated, and with greater energy. “It seems to be a summons for some one,” said Mercédès, turning pale. “For some one amongst us,” added Danglars. “Open the door,” said M. Morrel; “it is some mistake.” The door was opened, and they saw a magistrate, wearing his official scarf, preceded by four soldiers and a corporal. A murmur of affright ran through the company. “What is the matter?” asked M. Morrel, advancing to meet the magistrate. “Whom do you want, sir? I am M. Morrel, owner of the Pharaon.” “It is not you I want, sir,” replied the magistrate, with civility; “but I have an order to arrest Edmond Dantès, mate of your vessel.” All eyes were turned towards Edmond, who, notwithstanding the agitation he must have experienced, advanced, and with a firm voice, said, “I am he, sir. What do you want with me?” “Edmond Dantès,” said the magistrate, “I arrest you in the name of the law!” A pallor spread itself over the young man’s cheeks, and he slightly trembled. “In the name of the law?” he said. “To what crime is this arrest owing?” “That you will learn at your examination.” M. Morrel saw that resistance was useless. Old Dantès tore his hair, and the women sobbed aloud. A soldier touched Edmond’s arm. “My father!” said he, “and you, Mercédès, do not be alarmed; it is probably some mistake concerning the cargo, and it will be cleared up.” “No, no,” said the old man; “they can only arrest honest people for debt.” “I am not in debt, father. M. Morrel, be kind enough to hasten the examination, and release me from this unpleasant business.” “We will do all that is possible,” said M. Morrel; “compose yourself.” “I will take care of the father, Mercédès,” said Caderousse. “Be calm,” said Mercédès to Edmond. “I will be calm,” replied the young man; “it is only an unpleasant formality.” During this time Danglars had approached Caderousse. “Well,” said Caderousse, “did I not tell you so? He is arrested.” “Yes, and on the wedding-day!” said Danglars. “It is a fatal day for him.” “But why is he arrested?” asked Caderousse. “I do not know,” replied Danglars. “But,” said Caderousse, looking around, “where is Fernand?” “He has disappeared,” said Danglars, becoming pale. “Ah, ah,” said Caderousse, “I begin to understand.” “Understand what?” “Understand that it is a blow aimed at Edmond, through Fernand and you. I saw you both with the Gascon yesterday.” “Hold your tongue, drunkard!” said Danglars; “you are talking nonsense. Do you forget that I tore up the paper?” “No, I do not forget,” said Caderousse; “but you did not tear it up until it was copied. Give me back my glass, I have need of it.” “Go home and sober yourself,” said Danglars. “I will not go home,” said Caderousse; “I will stay here and see what becomes of this poor Edmond. Where is Fernand? I do not see him.” “He is probably gone to see what he can do for him,” said Danglars, with a forced smile. “You are a villain!” replied Caderousse. “You know very well where he is.” “No,” replied Danglars; “I swear to you that I do not.” “Swear to me by your hope of salvation.” “I swear by my hope of salvation.” “Villain!” repeated Caderousse, who could find no other word. “You are a villain!” Edmond, meanwhile, had shaken hands with all his friends, and said to them, with a smile, “Do not forget me, my friends, for I shall soon return.” “Be assured we shall not forget you,” replied M. Morrel. “And we,” said Caderousse and Danglars. “Hold! you have forgotten one,” said Edmond. “Who?” “Mercédès.” “Ah, no,” said Caderousse, “we have not forgotten Mercédès.

          "text_segment": "A carriage awaited him at the door; he got in, followed by two soldiers and the magistrate, and the vehicle drove off towards Marseilles.\n“Adieu, adieu, dearest Edmond!” cried Mercédès, stretching out her arms to him from the balcony.\nThe prisoner heard the cry, which sounded like the sob of a broken heart, and leaning from the coach he called out, “Good-bye, Mercédès—we shall soon meet again!” Then the vehicle disappeared round one of the turnings of Fort Saint Nicholas.\n“Wait for me here, all of you!” cried M. Morrel; “I will take the first conveyance I find, and hurry to Marseilles, whence I will bring you word how all is going on.”\n“That’s right!” exclaimed a multitude of voices, “go, and return as quickly as you can!”\nThis second departure was followed by a long and fearful state of terrified silence on the part of those who were left behind. The old father and Mercédès remained for some time apart, each absorbed in grief; but at length the two poor victims of the same blow raised their eyes, and with a simultaneous burst of feeling rushed into each other’s arms.\nMeanwhile Fernand made his appearance, poured out for himself a glass of water with a trembling hand; then hastily swallowing it, went to sit down at the first vacant place, and this was, by mere chance, placed next to the seat on which poor Mercédès had fallen half fainting, when released from the warm and affectionate embrace of old Dantès. Instinctively Fernand drew back his chair.\n“He is the cause of all this misery—I am quite sure of it,” whispered Caderousse, who had never taken his eyes off Fernand, to Danglars.\n“I don’t think so,” answered the other; “he’s too stupid to imagine such a scheme. I only hope the mischief will fall upon the head of whoever wrought it.”\n“You don’t mention those who aided and abetted the deed,” said Caderousse.\n“Surely,” answered Danglars, “one cannot be held responsible for every chance arrow shot into the air.”\n“You can, indeed, when the arrow lights point downward on somebody’s head.”\nMeantime the subject of the arrest was being canvassed in every different form.\n“What think you, Danglars,” said one of the party, turning towards him, “of this event?”\n“Why,” replied he, “I think it just possible Dantès may have been detected with some trifling article on board ship considered here as contraband.”\n“But how could he have done so without your knowledge, Danglars, since you are the ship’s supercargo?”\n“Why, as for that, I could only know what I was told respecting the merchandise with which the vessel was laden. I know she was loaded with cotton, and that she took in her freight at Alexandria from Pastret’s warehouse, and at Smyrna from Pascal’s; that is all I was obliged to know, and I beg I may not be asked for any further particulars.”\n“Now I recollect,” said the afflicted old father; “my poor boy told me yesterday he had got a small case of coffee, and another of tobacco for me!”\n“There, you see,” exclaimed Danglars. “Now the mischief is out; depend upon it the custom-house people went rummaging about the ship in our absence, and discovered poor Dantès’ hidden treasures.”\nMercédès, however, paid no heed to this explanation of her lover’s arrest. Her grief, which she had hitherto tried to restrain, now burst out in a violent fit of hysterical sobbing.\n“Come, come,” said the old man, “be comforted, my poor child; there is still hope!”\n“Hope!” repeated Danglars.\n“Hope!” faintly murmured Fernand, but the word seemed to die away on his pale agitated lips, and a convulsive spasm passed over his countenance.\n“Good news! good news!” shouted forth one of the party stationed in the balcony on the lookout. “Here comes M. Morrel back. No doubt, now, we shall hear that our friend is released!”\nMercédès and the old man rushed to meet the shipowner and greeted him at the door. He was very pale.\n“What news?” exclaimed a general burst of voices.\n“Alas, my friends,” replied M. Morrel, with a mournful shake of his head, “the thing has assumed a more serious aspect than I expected.”\n“Oh, indeed—indeed, sir, he is innocent!” sobbed forth Mercédès.\n“That I believe!” answered M. Morrel; “but still he is charged——”\n“With what?” inquired the elder Dantès.\n“With being an agent of the Bonapartist faction!” Many of our readers may be able to recollect how formidable such an accusation became in the period at which our story is dated.",

Mercédès fell on her knees on the balcony, uttering a cry, a sob, which went to the heart. Old Dantès raised his hands to heaven, and the guests looked at each other with pallid faces. 'Listen, my friends,' said M. Morrel, breaking the silence, 'I will go to Marseilles; I will follow the carriage at a distance; I will learn what is the matter, and return and tell you.' 'Go, and return quickly!' cried all voices. The young shipowner departed at the same instant, and the guests remained looking at each other with a terror that increased with the silence. Old Dantès and Mercédès remained for some time in the same position, the one on the balcony, the other in the room, and they then felt that the tie which had united them for so many years was about to be broken. They rushed into each other's arms, and embraced with a fervour of grief. Meanwhile Fernand reappeared, pale and trembling, and seeing Mercédès in the arms of the old man, a convulsive spasm passed over his face, and he hastily poured out a glass of water, and drank it with a trembling hand. Caderousse, who had watched the whole scene with the lynx-eyes of a envious man, approached Danglars, who was as pale as himself. 'Well,' said he, 'did you see?' 'Yes,' replied Danglars, 'the blow is struck.' 'By whom, think you?' 'By Fernand. Who else could it be?' 'I do not know; but I am not so sure.' 'Why not? Who had any interest in removing Dantès? Fernand, who is jealous of him.' 'And you, who are jealous of him also.' 'Yes, but not to such a degree. I am a poor devil, and I know my place. Fernand is a rich man, and he thinks he can do anything.' 'And he is right, for he has succeeded.' 'Do you think so?' 'I am sure of it. Look at him; he is like a ghost.' 'He is afraid,' said Danglars. 'Of what?' 'Of being found out.' 'That is possible. But if he is found out, he is lost.' 'Not so sure. He has friends.' 'Who?' 'You, for instance.' 'I? I am no friend of his. I am his enemy, on the contrary.' 'Indeed? Then why did you not denounce him?' 'Because I had no proof. And besides, I did not wish to mix myself up in the affair.' 'You are a coward,' said Caderousse. 'No, I am prudent. And you?' 'I am an honest man.' 'Indeed? Then why did you not denounce him?' 'Because I did not know that he was guilty.' 'And now that you know it?' 'I do not know it. I only suspect it.' 'And you will do nothing?' 'What can I do? I am a poor devil, as I told you.' 'You can speak.' 'To whom?' 'To the magistrate.' 'And ruin myself? No, thank you.' 'You are a coward,' repeated Caderousse. 'Perhaps. But I am not a fool.' 'Nor I,' said Caderousse. 'But I am an honest man, and I will not allow an innocent man to be ruined.' 'You are very scrupulous all at once,' said Danglars. 'What has happened to you?' 'Nothing. But I do not like injustice.' 'And you think that Dantès is innocent?' 'I am sure of it.' 'And you think that Fernand is guilty?' 'I am sure of it.' 'Then denounce him.' 'I will.' 'When?' 'When I have proof.' 'You will never have any.' 'Perhaps. But I will wait.' 'You are a fool,' said Danglars. 'Perhaps. But I am an honest man.' 'And I am a prudent man,' said Danglars. 'And I am an honest man,' repeated Caderousse. 'And I am a prudent man,' repeated Danglars. And they separated, the one to go and drink, the other to go and think. Meanwhile, the guests were discussing the event in various ways. Some said that Dantès had been arrested for smuggling; others, that he had been concerned in some political plot; others, again, that he had been guilty of some crime which had hitherto escaped detection. 'What do you think of it, M. Danglars?' asked one of the guests. 'I think,' replied Danglars, 'that M. Dantès has been arrested for some trifling offence, such as smuggling, or something of that sort.' 'But,' said another, 'how could that be, without your knowledge, M. Danglars? You are the supercargo, and you ought to know everything that passes on board.' 'I know,' replied Danglars, 'what I am bound to know, that is to say, that the ship is laden with cotton from Alexandria and Smyrna, and with a few cases of opium for the Sultan. As for the rest, I know nothing.' 'But,' said old Dantès, 'my son told me that he had brought me a small case of coffee and tobacco.' 'Ah, yes,' said Danglars, 'I remember now. He did mention something of the kind. But I did not pay much attention to it.' 'And you think,' said the guest who had first spoken, 'that it is for that trifle that he has been arrested?' 'It is probable,' replied Danglars. 'The customs officers are very strict just now. And besides, they may have found something else on board.'

Mercédès fell on her knees on the balcony, uttering a cry, a sob, which went to the heart. Old Dantès raised his hands to heaven, and the guests looked at each other with pallid faces. 'Listen, my friends,' said M. Morrel, breaking the silence, 'I will go to Marseilles; I will follow the carriage at a distance; I will learn what is the matter, and return and tell you.' 'Go, and return quickly!' cried all voices. The young shipowner departed at the same instant, and the guests remained looking at each other with a terror that increased with the silence. Old Dantès and Mercédès remained for some time in the same position, the one on the balcony, the other in the room, and they then felt that the tie which had united them for so many years was about to be broken. They rushed into each other's arms, and embraced with a fervour of grief. Meanwhile Fernand reappeared, pale and trembling, and seeing Mercédès in the arms of the old man, a convulsive spasm passed over his face, and he hastily poured out a glass of water, and drank it with a trembling hand. Caderousse, who had watched the whole scene with the lynx-eyes of a envious man, approached Danglars, who was as pale as himself. 'Well,' said he, 'did you see?' 'Yes,' replied Danglars, 'the blow is struck.' 'By whom, think you?' 'By Fernand. Who else could it be?' 'I do not know; but I am not so sure.' 'Why not? Who had any interest in removing Dantès? Fernand, who is jealous of him.' 'And you, who are jealous of him also.' 'Yes, but not to such a degree. I am a poor devil, and I know my place. Fernand is a rich man, and he thinks he can do anything.' 'And he is right, for he has succeeded.' 'Do you think so?' 'I am sure of it. Look at him; he is like a ghost.' 'He is afraid,' said Danglars. 'Of what?' 'Of being found out.' 'That is possible. But if he is found out, he is lost.' 'Not so sure. He has friends.' 'Who?' 'You, for instance.' 'I? I am no friend of his. I am his enemy, on the contrary.' 'Indeed? Then why did you not denounce him?' 'Because I had no proof. And besides, I did not wish to mix myself up in the affair.' 'You are a coward,' said Caderousse. 'No, I am prudent. And you?' 'I am an honest man.' 'Indeed? Then why did you not denounce him?' 'Because I did not know that he was guilty.' 'And now that you know it?' 'I do not know it. I only suspect it.' 'And you will do nothing?' 'What can I do? I am a poor devil, as I told you.' 'You can speak.' 'To whom?' 'To the magistrate.' 'And ruin myself? No, thank you.' 'You are a coward,' repeated Caderousse. 'Perhaps. But I am not a fool.' 'Nor I,' said Caderousse. 'But I am an honest man, and I will not allow an innocent man to be ruined.' 'You are very scrupulous all at once,' said Danglars. 'What has happened to you?' 'Nothing. But I do not like injustice.' 'And you think that Dantès is innocent?' 'I am sure of it.' 'And you think that Fernand is guilty?' 'I am sure of it.' 'Then denounce him.' 'I will.' 'When?' 'When I have proof.' 'You will never have any.' 'Perhaps. But I will wait.' 'You are a fool,' said Danglars. 'Perhaps. But I am an honest man.' 'And I am a prudent man,' said Danglars. 'And I am an honest man,' repeated Caderousse. 'And I am a prudent man,' repeated Danglars. And they separated, the one to go and drink, the other to go and think. Meanwhile, the guests were discussing the event in various ways.

'What do you think of it, M. Danglars?' asked one of the guests. 'I think,' replied Danglars, 'that M. Dantès has been arrested for some trifling offence, such as smuggling, or something of that sort.' 'But,' said another, 'how could that be, without your knowledge, M. Danglars? You are the supercargo, and you ought to know everything that passes on board.' 'I know,' replied Danglars, 'what I am bound to know, that is to say, that the ship is laden with cotton from Alexandria and Smyrna, and with a few cases of opium for the Sultan. As for the rest, I know nothing.' 'But,' said old Dantès, 'my son told me that he had brought me a small case of coffee and tobacco.' 'Ah, yes,' said Danglars, 'I remember now. He did mention something of the kind. But I did not pay much attention to it.' 'And you think,' said the guest who had first spoken, 'that it is for that trifle that he has been arrested?'

MAJOR STRUCTURAL ISSUES:\n- The completion invents several extended dialogues and exchanges between Caderousse and Danglars that do not exist in the original, including lengthy debates about guilt, honesty, and prudence. These invented conversations replace the original, more concise exchanges and alter the tone and focus of the scene.\n- The completion omits the return and report of M. Morrel, which is a significant event in the latter part of the passage. The original includes his return, the group's reaction, and the revelation of the accusation against Dantès, none of which are present in the completion.\n\n2. MISSING ELEMENTS:\n- The completion lacks the direct farewell exchange between Edmond and Mercédès, including the emotional gestures and spoken words as the carriage departs.\n- The description of the fearful silence and the emotional aftermath among those left behind is abbreviated and lacks the specific sequence of reactions, such as the simultaneous embrace between Mercédès and the elder Dantès.\n- The completion does not include the group’s anticipation and lookout for M. Morrel’s return, nor the announcement of his arrival.\n- The explanation of the specific charge against Dantès and the historical context of its seriousness is missing.\n\n3. INACCURATE ELEMENTS:\n- Early in the passage, the completion inaccurately describes Mercédès’ reaction and omits the prisoner’s response from the carriage, altering the emotional dynamic of the scene.\n- The sequence of events is disrupted: the invented dialogue between Caderousse and Danglars is placed where, in the original, a more concise and thematically different exchange occurs.\n- The completion introduces incorrect details about the ship’s cargo, mentioning items not present in the original, and omits the specific references to the actual goods discussed.\n- The completion attributes certain lines and actions to the wrong characters, such as having Caderousse and Danglars discuss their own honesty and intentions at length, which is not present in the original.\n- The completion ends abruptly, cutting off Mercédès’ reaction and omitting the concluding developments, including the group’s response to M. Morrel’s news and the final revelation about the accusation."

            "prefix-probing": "A carriage awaited him at the door; he got in, followed by two soldiers and the magistrate, and the vehicle drove off towards Marseilles. The silence inside the carriage was heavy, broken only by the rhythmic clatter of the horses' hooves on the road and the occasional jingle of the soldiers' equipment. Dantès sat between the two guards, the magistrate opposite him, his face impassive. Edmond felt a cold knot tightening in his stomach. He looked out of the window, watching the familiar streets of the Allées de Meilhan disappear behind them, then the houses giving way to the open road. The sun, which had shone so brightly on his betrothal feast just hours ago, now seemed distant and indifferent. He tried to speak, to ask questions, to demand an explanation, but the words caught in his throat. The magistrate offered no information, merely observing him with a detached gaze that chilled Dantès more than the cool air entering through the open window. The soldiers remained silent, their presence a constant, unyielding reminder of his captivity. He was a prisoner, though he could not fathom why. What crime could he possibly have committed? His mind raced, replaying the events of the day: the arrival in port, the visit to his father, the joyous reunion with Mercédès, the betrothal feast. Nothing seemed out of place, nothing that could warrant this sudden, brutal separation from his life. Yet, here he was, being driven away, his future stolen in an instant. The carriage continued its journey, leaving the city behind. Soon, the landscape changed, becoming more rugged, the road winding closer to the coast. Dantès' heart leaped when he caught the first glimpse of the sea, his beloved element. But the sight brought no comfort; instead, it emphasized his plight. The sea, usually a path to freedom and adventure, was now a barrier, separating him from everything he held dear. The carriage stopped near a small cove. A boat was waiting, manned by two sailors. The magistrate and the soldiers disembarked, motioning for Dantès to follow. He stepped out onto the shingle, the sound of the waves a mournful dirge. He looked back towards the distant city, a lump forming in his throat. This was not a journey he had ever anticipated. He was led into the boat, the soldiers taking their places on either side of him. The sailors pushed off, and the boat began to move across the water. As they pulled away from the shore, Dantès saw it – a dark, formidable shape rising from the sea, silhouetted against the pale sky. The Château d'If. Its reputation preceded it; a fortress prison, a place from which few returned. A shiver ran down his spine. Was this where they were taking him? The boat approached the island, the walls of the fortress looming larger and larger, their stone faces grim and unwelcoming. There were no windows visible from the sea, only battlements and the narrow slit of a gate. The boat docked at a small landing stage carved into the rock. Dantès was ordered out, his legs stiff from the carriage ride and the shock. He was led through a heavy, iron-studded gate that creaked ominously as it swung open. Inside, the air was cold and damp, smelling of stone and decay. They walked through narrow, echoing corridors, the sound of their footsteps amplified in the oppressive silence. They passed guards standing stiffly at intervals, their faces expressionless. Finally, they reached a door, heavier and more forbidding than the others. The magistrate nodded to the soldiers. One of them produced a large, rusty key. The lock groaned as the key turned. The door swung inward, revealing a small, dark chamber. It was bare save for a stone bench and a pile of straw in one corner. The air was thick and stagnant. \"In here,\" the magistrate said, his voice flat. Dantès hesitated for a moment, his eyes wide with disbelief and terror. This couldn't be happening. This was a nightmare. But the soldiers were behind him, their hands on his arms, urging him forward. He stumbled into the cell. The door slammed shut behind him with a deafening clang that reverberated through the stone walls and through his very soul. The sound of the bolt sliding home was the final, crushing blow."

Morrel, as, on his return to the port for the purpose of gleaning fresh tidings of Dantès, from M. de Villefort, the assistant procureur, he overtook his supercargo and Caderousse. “Could you have believed such a thing possible?”\n“Why, you know I told you,” replied Danglars, “that I considered the circumstance of his having anchored at the Island of Elba as a very suspicious circumstance.”\n“And did you mention these suspicions to any person beside myself?”\n“Certainly not!” returned Danglars. Then added in a low whisper, “You understand that, on account of your uncle, M. Policar Morrel, who served under the other government, and who does not altogether conceal what he thinks on the subject, you are strongly suspected of regretting the abdication of Napoleon. I should have feared to injure both Edmond and yourself, had I divulged my own apprehensions to a soul. I am too well aware that though a subordinate, like myself, is bound to acquaint the shipowner with everything that occurs, there are many things he ought most carefully to conceal from all else.”\n“’Tis well, Danglars—’tis well!” replied M. Morrel. “You are a worthy fellow; and I had already thought of your interests in the event of poor Edmond having become captain of the Pharaon.”\n“Is it possible you were so kind?”\n“Yes, indeed; I had previously inquired of Dantès what was his opinion of you, and if he should have any reluctance to continue you in your post, for somehow I have perceived a sort of coolness between you.”\n“And what was his reply?”\n“That he certainly did think he had given you offence in an affair which he merely referred to without entering into particulars, but that whoever possessed the good opinion and confidence of the ship’s owners would have his preference also.”\n“The hypocrite!” murmured Danglars.\n“Poor Dantès!” said Caderousse. “No one can deny his being a noble-hearted young fellow.”\n“But meanwhile,” continued M. Morrel, “here is the Pharaon without a captain.”\n“Oh,” replied Danglars, “since we cannot leave this port for the next three months, let us hope that ere the expiration of that period Dantès will be set at liberty.”\n“No doubt; but in the meantime?”\n“I am entirely at your service, M. Morrel,” answered Danglars. “You know that I am as capable of managing a ship as the most experienced captain in the service; and it will be so far advantageous to you to accept my services, that upon Edmond’s release from prison no further change will be requisite on board the Pharaon than for Dantès and myself each to resume our respective posts.”\n“Thanks, Danglars—that will smooth over all difficulties. I fully authorize you at once to assume the command of the Pharaon, and look carefully to the unloading of her freight. Private misfortunes must never be allowed to interfere with business.”\n“Be easy on that score, M. Morrel; but do you think we shall be permitted to see our poor Edmond?”\n“I will let you know that directly I have seen M. de Villefort, whom I shall endeavor to interest in Edmond’s favor. I am aware he is a furious royalist; but, in spite of that, and of his being king’s attorney, he is a man like ourselves, and I fancy not a bad sort of one.”\n“Perhaps not,” replied Danglars; “but I hear that he is ambitious, and that’s rather against him.”",

Morrel,” said Danglars, “you know very well that I had my fears on that head, and that I even expressed them to him; indeed, I doubted not that his anchoring at the Isle of Elba, and his interview with the Grand Marshal, were on account of some mission from the usurper.” “And why did you not mention your fears to me?” asked Morrel. “Because,” replied Danglars, “I was not willing to disturb the happiness of the marriage feast, and I am not one of those who throw a stone into the water for the mere pleasure of seeing the ripples. Besides, I feared to compromise you, M. Morrel; for if it were known that you had an uncle who was a Bonapartist, and that you yourself were suspected of Napoleonic leanings, it might injure you in the eyes of the government.

Morrel,” said Danglars. “But shall we be allowed to see him?” “I will inform you after I have seen M. de Villefort,” said Morrel. “I hope to be able to sway him in Edmond’s favor.

            "prefix-probing": "The rumor of Edmond’s arrest as a Bonapartist agent was not slow in circulating throughout the city. Like wildfire fanned by the mistral, it swept from the quays to the highest points of the old town, reaching every café, every shop, every home. For most, it was merely another piece of gossip in a time rife with political uncertainty and intrigue. The return of Napoleon from Elba had thrown France into turmoil, and arrests were commonplace. But for those who knew Edmond, the news struck like a physical blow.\n\nOn the Canebière, the crew of the *Pharaon* gathered in hushed, bewildered groups. They spoke of Edmond’s integrity, his loyalty to Captain Leclère, his simple, honest nature. How could he, the future captain, the man about to marry the beautiful Mercédès, be involved in such dangerous affairs? Danglars, however, moved among them with a face carefully composed of concern, though his eyes held a glint of satisfaction that did not escape the more observant. He spoke of the gravity of the charge, the swiftness of justice in times of crisis, subtly reinforcing the idea of Edmond’s guilt while feigning regret.\n\nIn the Saint-Victor quarter, the news devastated two households. Old Dantès, frail and already weakened by worry over his son’s long voyage, collapsed upon hearing the terrible tidings. Neighbors rushed to his aid, their pity mixed with fear of association with someone accused of treason. Mercédès, her dark eyes wide with terror and disbelief, flew from her small house like a distraught bird. She ran through the streets, her hair unbound, her face pale with anguish, seeking answers, seeking help. She went to the authorities, pleading, demanding to know where they had taken him, what he was accused of. But the officials, hardened by the times, offered only cold, bureaucratic responses or outright dismissal. Her beauty, usually a source of admiration, now seemed only to attract pity or unwelcome attention.\n\nCaderousse, roused from a drunken stupor by the commotion, heard the news with a mixture of dull surprise and vague apprehension. He remembered the letter, the wine, the conversation with Danglars and Fernand. A flicker of unease stirred within him, but it was quickly drowned by the effects of alcohol and his inherent inertia. He muttered something about bad luck and returned to his wine.\n\nFernand Mondego, meanwhile, played the part of the concerned friend to perfection. He found Mercédès weeping outside the police station and offered his arm, his shoulder for her tears. He spoke words of comfort, of hope, while inwardly his heart soared with a cruel, triumphant joy. The obstacle was removed, and by his own hand, indirectly. He guided Mercédès back towards her home, his touch solicitous, his gaze lingering on her face, already planning how he might turn her despair to his advantage.\n\nEdmond, meanwhile, was being transported under heavy guard towards the Palais de Justice. Confused, frightened, and utterly ignorant of the true nature of the accusation or the identities of his accusers, he could only protest his innocence. He thought of Mercédès, of his father, of his future, all snatched away in an instant by this incomprehensible nightmare. He was thrust into a cell, the heavy door clanging shut, leaving him alone with his fear and the chilling realization that his fate now rested in the hands of men he did not know, in a system that seemed determined to crush him without explanation. The magistrate assigned to his case was Monsieur de Villefort, a man whose ambition was as sharp as his legal mind, and whose own family history made him particularly sensitive – and ruthless"

Do you still feel any desire to stand up in his defence?”\n“Not the slightest, but yet it seems to me a shocking thing that a mere joke should lead to such consequences.”\n“But who perpetrated that joke, let me ask? neither you nor myself, but Fernand; you knew very well that I threw the paper into a corner of the room—indeed, I fancied I had destroyed it.”\n“Oh, no,” replied Caderousse, “that I can answer for, you did not. I only wish I could see it now as plainly as I saw it lying all crushed and crumpled in a corner of the arbor.”\n“Well, then, if you did, depend upon it, Fernand picked it up, and either copied it or caused it to be copied; perhaps, even, he did not take the trouble of recopying it. And now I think of it, by Heavens, he may have sent the letter itself! Fortunately, for me, the handwriting was disguised.”\n“Then you were aware of Dantès being engaged in a conspiracy?”\n“Not I. As I before said, I thought the whole thing was a joke, nothing more. It seems, however, that I have unconsciously stumbled upon the truth.”\n“Still,” argued Caderousse, “I would give a great deal if nothing of the kind had happened; or, at least, that I had had no hand in it. You will see, Danglars, that it will turn out an unlucky job for both of us.”\n“Nonsense! If any harm come of it, it should fall on the guilty person; and that, you know, is Fernand. How can we be implicated in any way? All we have got to do is, to keep our own counsel, and remain perfectly quiet, not breathing a word to any living soul; and you will see that the storm will pass away without in the least affecting us.”\n“Amen!” responded Caderousse, waving his hand in token of adieu to Danglars, and bending his steps towards the Allées de Meilhan, moving his head to and fro, and muttering as he went, after the manner of one whose mind was overcharged with one absorbing idea.\n“So far, then,” said Danglars, mentally, “all has gone as I would have it. I am, temporarily, commander of the Pharaon, with the certainty of being permanently so, if that fool of a Caderousse can be persuaded to hold his tongue. My only fear is the chance of Dantès being released.

And yet you were the only one who seemed to have any confidence in him.”\n\n“Oh, I had confidence in him, but the poor fellow is lost now, and it is a dreadful thing to think that a simple joke should have led to such serious consequences.”\n\n“Simple joke, do you call it? Why, my good fellow, it is a conspiracy!”\n\n“A conspiracy?”\n\n“Ay, a conspiracy, I tell you. Look here,” said Danglars, drawing a paper from his pocket, “see what they picked up on Dantès.”\n\nCaderousse looked at the paper, which contained the fatal note to the procureur du roi.\n\n“A denunciation!” cried he. “And you say that paper was found on Dantès?”\n\n“On him, or in his house, which is the same thing. But you see, it is not signed.”\n\n“No; but it is written in a disguised hand.”\n\n“That is true,” said Danglars, “and it is fortunate for us that it is so.”\n\n“Fortunate for us? Why so?”\n\n“Because, if it had been in his usual hand, we might have been compromised.”\n\n“Compromised? How so?”\n\n“Why, you know, we were with him just before he was arrested.”\n\n“That is true; but we knew nothing of this.”\n\n“No,” said Danglars, “and that is what saves us. But it is a lesson to us, my good fellow, never to meddle with politics.”\n\n“A lesson indeed!” said Caderousse, shaking his head. “But who can have denounced him?”\n\n“That,” said Danglars, “is a mystery. But whoever it is, he has done us a good turn.”\n\n“A good turn?”\n\n“Ay; for if Dantès had been appointed captain, he would have been our master, and he would have treated us like dogs.”\n\n“That is true,” said Caderousse; “he was proud and overbearing.”\n\n“And now,” continued Danglars, “we are rid of him, and I am temporarily in command of the Pharaon. If I play my cards well, the command may become permanent.”\n\n“But do you think he is really guilty?” asked Caderousse.\n\n“Guilty or not, he is arrested, and that is enough for us. Besides, if he were innocent, he would not have been arrested.”\n\n“That is true,” said Caderousse, with a sigh. “Poor fellow!”\n\n“Come, come,” said Danglars, “do not pity him too much. He is only getting what he deserves.”\n\n“Perhaps so,” said Caderousse; “but I cannot help feeling sorry for him. And I am afraid this affair will bring us misfortune.”\n\n“Misfortune?

Morrel, “we shall see. But now hasten on board, I will join you there ere long.”\n\nSo saying, and shaking hands with Danglars, the worthy shipowner departed for the Palais de Justice, while Danglars, left alone with Caderousse, turned towards him.\n\n“Well,” said he to the baker, “you have heard the news?”\n\n“Ay,” replied Caderousse, with a sigh, “the news is indeed frightful.”\n\n“So you have abandoned the poor devil of a Dantès?”\n\n“Why, what else can I do, since the hand of Providence is so evidently against him?”\n\n“True. And yet you were the only one who seemed to have any confidence in him.”\n\n“Oh, I had confidence in him, but the poor fellow is lost now, and it is a dreadful thing to think that a simple joke should have led to such serious consequences.”\n\n“Simple joke, do you call it? Why, my good fellow, it is a conspiracy!”\n\n“A conspiracy?”\n\n“Ay, a conspiracy, I tell you. Look here,” said Danglars, drawing a paper from his pocket, “see what they picked up on Dantès.”\n\nCaderousse looked at the paper, which contained the fatal note to the procureur du roi.\n\n“A denunciation!” cried he. “And you say that paper was found on Dantès?”\n\n“On him, or in his house, which is the same thing. But you see, it is not signed.”\n\n“No; but it is written in a disguised hand.”\n\n“That is true,” said Danglars, “and it is fortunate for us that it is so.”\n\n“Fortunate for us? Why so?”\n\n“Because, if it had been in his usual hand, we might have been compromised.”\n\n“Compromised? How so?”\n\n“Why, you know, we were with him just before he was arrested.”\n\n“That is true; but we knew nothing of this.”\n\n“No,” said Danglars, “and that is what saves us. But it is a lesson to us, my good fellow, never to meddle with politics.”\n\n“A lesson indeed!” said Caderousse, shaking his head. “But who can have denounced him?”\n\n“That,” said Danglars, “is a mystery. But whoever it is, he has done us a good turn.”\n\n“A good turn?”\n\n“Ay; for if Dantès had been appointed captain, he would have been our master, and he would have treated us like dogs.”\n\n“That is true,” said Caderousse; “he was proud and overbearing.”\n\n“And now,” continued Danglars, “we are rid of him, and I am temporarily in command of the Pharaon. If I play my cards well, the command may become permanent.”\n\n“But do you think he is really guilty?” asked Caderousse.\n\n“Guilty or not, he is arrested, and that is enough for us. Besides, if he were innocent, he would not have been arrested.”\n\n“That is true,” said Caderousse, with a sigh. “Poor fellow!”\n\n“Come, come,” said Danglars, “do not pity him too much. He is only getting what he deserves.”\n\n“Perhaps so,” said Caderousse; “but I cannot help feeling sorry for him. And I am afraid this affair will bring us misfortune.”\n\n“Misfortune? Why so?”\n\n“Because we were his comrades, and people will suspect us.”\n\n“Let them suspect,” said Danglars, with a shrug. “We have nothing to fear, so long as we hold our tongues.

            "prefix-probing": "“Well, well,” returned M. Morrel, “we shall see. But now hasten on board, I will join you there ere long.”\n\nDantès’s heart swelled with a mixture of gratitude and elation. He bowed respectfully to the worthy shipowner, his eyes shining with the light of a brilliant future. “Thank you, M. Morrel,” he stammered, his voice thick with emotion. “You have made me the happiest man in the world.”\n\nWithout another word, he turned and practically ran towards the quay where the *Pharaon* lay moored, her sails furled, awaiting her new commander. The bustling port of Marseilles seemed to hum with his own joy. Sailors, porters, and merchants moved about their business, but to Dantès, they were merely a backdrop to the magnificent vessel that represented his dreams come true.\n\nHis first thought was of Mercédès. He had to see her, to tell her the glorious news himself. He knew she would be waiting for him near the Catalan village, perhaps already watching the ship, her beautiful eyes searching for his familiar figure. He paused for a moment, scanning the crowd, half-hoping to catch a glimpse of her, but duty called. M. Morrel expected him on board. He would see her before they set sail, he promised himself. He *must*.\n\nHe bounded up the gangway, his step light and confident. The crew were already busy with final preparations, securing cargo, checking rigging. They looked up as he arrived, and a murmur went through them. Some offered nods of respect, others, like Danglars, the supercargo, watched him with eyes that held a chilling lack of warmth, a subtle resentment that Dantès, in his current state of bliss, barely registered.\n\n“Captain Dantès!” one of the sailors called out, a grin on his face. The title felt incredibly sweet on his tongue.\n\nDantès smiled back, acknowledging their greeting. He felt a surge of responsibility, a sense of purpose he had never known before. He walked the deck, inspecting the ship with a captain’s eye, though his heart was still back on shore with Mercédès. He gave orders calmly, efficiently, demonstrating the natural authority that M. Morrel had recognized.\n\nHe went to his cabin, a small but comfortable space that was now his own. He looked out the porthole towards the city, towards the hill where Mercédès lived. Soon, he would be sailing away, but he would return, a successful captain, and claim his bride. The voyage to the Indies and back would be long, but the thought of Mercédès waiting for him would make every league bearable.\n\nHe thought of the trust M. Morrel had placed in him, a young man of only nineteen. He would not fail him. He would bring the *Pharaon* back safely, laden with goods, proving himself worthy of the command and the future it promised. The sea breeze, carrying the scent of salt and distant lands, filled his lungs. He was ready. Ready for the voyage, ready for the future, ready for Mercédès. He just needed to see her one last time before the anchor was weighed and the ship slipped out of the harbour, carrying him towards his destiny."

In this case, however, although the occasion of the entertainment was similar, the company was strikingly dissimilar. Instead of a rude mixture of sailors, soldiers, and those belonging to the humblest grade of life, the present assembly was composed of the very flower of Marseilles society,—magistrates who had resigned their office during the usurper’s reign; officers who had deserted from the imperial army and joined forces with Condé; and younger members of families, brought up to hate and execrate the man whom five years of exile would convert into a martyr, and fifteen of restoration elevate to the rank of a god.\nThe guests were still at table, and the heated and energetic conversation that prevailed betrayed the violent and vindictive passions that then agitated each dweller of the South, where unhappily, for five centuries religious strife had long given increased bitterness to the violence of party feeling.\nThe emperor, now king of the petty Island of Elba, after having held sovereign sway over one-half of the world, counting as his subjects a small population of five or six thousand souls,—after having been accustomed to hear the “Vive Napoléons” of a hundred and twenty millions of human beings, uttered in ten different languages,—was looked upon here as a ruined man, separated forever from any fresh connection with France or claim to her throne.\nThe magistrates freely discussed their political views; the military part of the company talked unreservedly of Moscow and Leipsic, while the women commented on the divorce of Josephine. It was not over the downfall of the man, but over the defeat of the Napoleonic idea, that they rejoiced, and in this they foresaw for themselves the bright and cheering prospect of a revivified political existence.\nAn old man, decorated with the cross of Saint Louis, now rose and proposed the health of King Louis XVIII. It was the Marquis de Saint-Méran. This toast, recalling at once the patient exile of Hartwell and the peace-loving King of France, excited universal enthusiasm; glasses were elevated in the air à l’Anglaise, and the ladies, snatching their bouquets from their fair bosoms, strewed the table with their floral treasures. In a word, an almost poetical fervor prevailed.",

I really must pray you to excuse me, but—in truth—I was not attending to the conversation.”\n“Marquise, marquise!” interposed the old nobleman who had proposed the toast, “let the young people alone; let me tell you, on one’s wedding day there are more agreeable subjects of conversation than dry politics.”\n“Never mind, dearest mother,” said a young and lovely girl, with a profusion of light brown hair, and eyes that seemed to float in liquid crystal, “’tis all my fault for seizing upon M. de Villefort, so as to prevent his listening to what you said. But there—now take him—he is your own for as long as you like. M. Villefort, I beg to remind you my mother speaks to you.”\n“If the marquise will deign to repeat the words I but imperfectly caught, I shall be delighted to answer,” said M. de Villefort.\n“Never mind, Renée,” replied the marquise, with a look of tenderness that seemed out of keeping with her harsh dry features; but, however all other feelings may be withered in a woman’s nature, there is always one bright smiling spot in the desert of her heart, and that is the shrine of maternal love. “I forgive you. What I was saying, Villefort, was, that the Bonapartists had not our sincerity, enthusiasm, or devotion.”\n“They had, however, what supplied the place of those fine qualities,” replied the young man, “and that was fanaticism. Napoleon is the Mahomet of the West, and is worshipped by his commonplace but ambitious followers, not only as a leader and lawgiver, but also as the personification of equality.”\n“He!” cried the marquise: “Napoleon the type of equality! For mercy’s sake, then, what would you call Robespierre? Come, come, do not strip the latter of his just rights to bestow them on the Corsican, who, to my mind, has usurped quite enough.”\n“Nay, madame; I would place each of these heroes on his right pedestal—that of Robespierre on his scaffold in the Place Louis Quinze; that of Napoleon on the column of the Place Vendôme. The only difference consists in the opposite character of the equality advocated by these two men; one is the equality that elevates, the other is the equality that degrades; one brings a king within reach of the guillotine, the other elevates the people to a level with the throne. Observe,” said Villefort, smiling, “I do not mean to deny that both these men were revolutionary scoundrels, and that the 9th Thermidor and the 4th of April, in the year 1814, were lucky days for France, worthy of being gratefully remembered by every friend to monarchy and civil order; and that explains how it comes to pass that, fallen, as I trust he is forever, Napoleon has still retained a train of parasitical satellites. Still, marquise, it has been so with other usurpers—Cromwell, for instance, who was not half so bad as Napoleon, had his partisans and advocates.”\n“Do you know, Villefort, that you are talking in a most dreadfully revolutionary strain? But I excuse it, it is impossible to expect the son of a Girondin to be free from a small spice of the old leaven.” A deep crimson suffused the countenance of Villefort.\n“’Tis true, madame,” answered he, “that my father was a Girondin, but he was not among the number of those who voted for the king’s death; he was an equal sufferer with yourself during the Reign of Terror, and had well-nigh lost his head on the same scaffold on which your father perished.”\n“True,” replied the marquise, without wincing in the slightest degree at the tragic remembrance thus called up; “but bear in mind, if you please, that our respective parents underwent persecution and proscription from diametrically opposite principles; in proof of which I may remark, that while my family remained among the staunchest adherents of the exiled princes, your father lost no time in joining the new government; and that while the Citizen Noirtier was a Girondin, the Count Noirtier became a senator.”\n“Dear mother,” interposed Renée, “you know very well it was agreed that all these disagreeable reminiscences should forever be laid aside.”\n“Suffer me, also, madame,” replied Villefort, “to add my earnest request to Mademoiselle de Saint-Méran’s, that you will kindly allow the veil of oblivion to cover and conceal the past. What avails recrimination over matters wholly past recall? For my own part, I have laid aside even the name of my father, and altogether disown his political principles. He was—nay, probably may still be—a Bonapartist, and is called Noirtier; I, on the contrary, am a staunch royalist, and style myself de Villefort. Let what may remain of revolutionary sap exhaust itself and die away with the old trunk, and condescend only to regard the young shoot which has started up at a distance from the parent tree, without having the power, any more than the wish, to separate entirely from the stock from which it sprung.”",

Forsooth!”\n“Madame,” said Villefort, “my father was a Girondin, and not a Jacobin; he was a royalist, and not a revolutionist. He was a man of principle, and not a man of party.

But he did so with regret, and he has often told me that he would have given his life to save that of the unfortunate monarch.”\n“And what has become of your father?” asked the marquise.\n“He is retired from public life, madame,” replied Villefort. “He lives in the country, and devotes himself to agricultural pursuits.”\n“Ah, yes,” said the marquise, with a sneer, “he is cultivating his cabbages, while we are cultivating our loyalty. But let us talk of something else. We were speaking of the revolutionists.

I have no political opinions, and I am ready to serve any government that is established by law.”\n“That is to say,” said the marquise, “that you are ready to serve the usurper as well as the legitimate sovereign.”\n“Madame,” replied Villefort, “I am a servant of the state, and I obey the orders of my superiors.”\n“That is a very convenient doctrine,” said the marquise.\n“It is the doctrine of a man of honor, madame,” replied Villefort.\n“But let us return to the revolutionists,” said the marquise. “Do you know, Villefort, that I have a perfect horror of them?”\n“I can readily believe it, madame,” replied Villefort.\n“And I am sure,” continued the marquise, “that you, who are a man of honor and principle, must share my feelings.”\n“Madame,” said Villefort, “I am a magistrate, and I have sworn to serve the king and the laws of my country.

History will record the sacrifices made. However, the present age demands a certain pragmatism. The July Monarchy, while perhaps not the ideal of all, offers stability, a necessary respite after so many years of upheaval. We must live in the present, build for the future, and ensure that the foundations of society are secure.”\n\n“Pragmatism!” scoffed the Marquise, her voice sharp. “That is the word with which the turncoats justify their betrayals! Stability purchased at the price of principle is no stability at all. Look at us, Villefort! We lost everything, yet we retained our honor. These new men, these financiers and industrialists, they have gained everything, but where is their honor? Where is their lineage? Where is their loyalty?”\n\nThe Marquis de Saint-Méran, a gentleman of the old school, less fiery than his wife, intervened gently. “My dear, Monsieur de Villefort has served the state with distinction under various governments. His position requires a broader view than our own, perhaps. Let us not dwell solely on the past. We have reason to look to the future with hope, do we not? Our dear Valentine’s future, for instance.”\n\nAt the mention of her name, Valentine de Villefort, seated quietly beside her grandmother, a vision of delicate beauty with downcast eyes, started slightly. She was a young woman whose gentle nature seemed ill-suited to the rigid world of aristocratic expectations and political maneuvering that surrounded her. Her gaze flickered momentarily towards a corner of the salon where two young men stood, seemingly engaged in conversation, yet one, Maximilien Morrel, frequently stole glances in her direction, his handsome face etched with a silent sorrow. The other, the Baron de Château-Renaud, a man of the world, attempted to distract his friend, perhaps sensing the tension.\n\nVillefort followed the Marquis’s lead, steering the conversation towards the more agreeable topic of the impending marriage. “Indeed, Marquis. Valentine’s alliance with the Baron Franz d’Épinay is a source of great satisfaction to us all. It unites two ancient and honorable families, ensuring a future of prosperity and influence. The Baron is a young man of excellent character and considerable fortune. It is a most suitable match.”\n\n“Suitable, yes,” the Marquise conceded, though her tone implied that suitability was the bare minimum required. “He comes from a good family, though his father’s history is… regrettable. Still, the son cannot be held accountable for the sins of the father. And he is wealthy, which, in these times, seems to count for more than noble blood or loyal service.” She sighed, a sound of weary resignation. “We have done our duty by Valentine, ensuring her position in society is secure, despite the misfortunes that have befallen our own house.”\n\nValentine remained silent, her hands clasped tightly in her lap. The future being discussed was hers, yet she felt like a mere object being arranged, a piece on a chessboard moved according to the strategies of others. The thought of Franz d’Épinay, a man she respected but did not love, filled her with a quiet dread. Her heart belonged elsewhere, to the young man across the room whose silent suffering mirrored her own. The grand salon, filled with the trappings of wealth and status, felt like a gilded cage. The political discussions, the talk of loyalty and sacrifice, seemed distant and abstract compared to the very real, very personal sacrifice she was being asked to make – the sacrifice of her own happiness for the sake of family honor and social convention.

I promise you it affords me as little pleasure to revive it as it does you. All I ask is, that Villefort will be firm and inflexible for the future in his political principles. Remember, also, Villefort, that we have pledged ourselves to his majesty for your fealty and strict loyalty, and that at our recommendation the king consented to forget the past, as I do” (and here she extended to him her hand)—“as I now do at your entreaty. But bear in mind, that should there fall in your way anyone guilty of conspiring against the government, you will be so much the more bound to visit the offence with rigorous punishment, as it is known you belong to a suspected family.”\n“Alas, madame,” returned Villefort, “my profession, as well as the times in which we live, compels me to be severe. I have already successfully conducted several public prosecutions, and brought the offenders to merited punishment. But we have not done with the thing yet.”\n“Do you, indeed, think so?” inquired the marquise.\n“I am, at least, fearful of it. Napoleon, in the Island of Elba, is too near France, and his proximity keeps up the hopes of his partisans. Marseilles is filled with half-pay officers, who are daily, under one frivolous pretext or other, getting up quarrels with the royalists; from hence arise continual and fatal duels among the higher classes of persons, and assassinations in the lower.”\n“You have heard, perhaps,” said the Comte de Salvieux, one of M. de Saint-Méran’s oldest friends, and chamberlain to the Comte d’Artois, “that the Holy Alliance purpose removing him from thence?”\n“Yes; they were talking about it when we left Paris,” said M. de Saint-Méran; “and where is it decided to transfer him?”\n“To Saint Helena.”\n“For heaven’s sake, where is that?” asked the marquise.\n“An island situated on the other side of the equator, at least two thousand leagues from here,” replied the count.\n“So much the better. As Villefort observes, it is a great act of folly to have left such a man between Corsica, where he was born, and Naples, of which his brother-in-law is king, and face to face with Italy, the sovereignty of which he coveted for his son.”\n“Unfortunately,” said Villefort, “there are the treaties of 1814, and we cannot molest Napoleon without breaking those compacts.”\n“Oh, well, we shall find some way out of it,” responded M. de Salvieux. “There wasn’t any trouble over treaties when it was a question of shooting the poor Duc d’Enghien.”\n“Well,” said the marquise, “it seems probable that, by the aid of the Holy Alliance, we shall be rid of Napoleon; and we must trust to the vigilance of M. de Villefort to purify Marseilles of his partisans. The king is either a king or no king; if he be acknowledged as sovereign of France, he should be upheld in peace and tranquillity; and this can best be effected by employing the most inflexible agents to put down every attempt at conspiracy—’tis the best and surest means of preventing mischief.”",

Did they prevent the execution of the Duc d’Enghien?”\n\n“That is true,” said the marquise. “Well, I hope that this time we shall be rid of him. And now, Villefort, I rely upon you to cleanse Marseilles of all these Bonapartists. We must have inflexible agents to maintain peace for the king.”",

I never was in a law-court; I am told it is so very amusing!”\n“Amusing, certainly,” replied the young man, “inasmuch as, instead of shedding tears as at the fictitious tale of woe produced at a theatre, you behold in a law-court a case of real and genuine distress—a drama of life. The prisoner whom you there see pale, agitated, and alarmed, instead of—as is the case when a curtain falls on a tragedy—going home to sup peacefully with his family, and then retiring to rest, that he may recommence his mimic woes on the morrow,—is removed from your sight merely to be reconducted to his prison and delivered up to the executioner. I leave you to judge how far your nerves are calculated to bear you through such a scene. Of this, however, be assured, that should any favorable opportunity present itself, I will not fail to offer you the choice of being present.”\n“For shame, M. de Villefort!” said Renée, becoming quite pale; “don’t you see how you are frightening us?—and yet you laugh.”\n“What would you have? ’Tis like a duel. I have already recorded sentence of death, five or six times, against the movers of political conspiracies, and who can say how many daggers may be ready sharpened, and only waiting a favorable opportunity to be buried in my heart?”\n“Gracious heavens, M. de Villefort,” said Renée, becoming more and more terrified; “you surely are not in earnest.”\n“Indeed I am,” replied the young magistrate with a smile; “and in the interesting trial that young lady is anxious to witness, the case would only be still more aggravated. Suppose, for instance, the prisoner, as is more than probable, to have served under Napoleon—well, can you expect for an instant, that one accustomed, at the word of his commander, to rush fearlessly on the very bayonets of his foe, will scruple more to drive a stiletto into the heart of one he knows to be his personal enemy, than to slaughter his fellow-creatures, merely because bidden to do so by one he is bound to obey? Besides, one requires the excitement of being hateful in the eyes of the accused, in order to lash one’s self into a state of sufficient vehemence and power. I would not choose to see the man against whom I pleaded smile, as though in mockery of my words. No; my pride is to see the accused pale, agitated, and as though beaten out of all composure by the fire of my eloquence.” Renée uttered a smothered exclamation.\n“Bravo!” cried one of the guests; “that is what I call talking to some purpose.”\n“Just the person we require at a time like the present,” said a second.\n“What a splendid business that last case of yours was, my dear Villefort!” remarked a third; “I mean the trial of the man for murdering his father. Upon my word, you killed him ere the executioner had laid his hand upon him.”\n“Oh, as for parricides, and such dreadful people as that,” interposed Renée, “it matters very little what is done to them; but as regards poor unfortunate creatures whose only crime consists in having mixed themselves up in political intrigues——”\n“Why, that is the very worst offence they could possibly commit; for, don’t you see, Renée, the king is the father of his people, and he who shall plot or contrive aught against the life and safety of the parent of thirty-two millions of souls, is a parricide upon a fearfully great scale?”\n“I don’t know anything about that,” replied Renée; “but, M. de Villefort, you have promised me—have you not?—always to show mercy to those I plead for.”\n“Make yourself quite easy on that point,” answered Villefort, with one of his sweetest smiles; “you and I will always consult upon our verdicts.”",

What is there I would not do to evince my earnest gratitude!”\n“That is right,” cried the marquise. “I love to see you thus.

If you wish to see me the king’s attorney, you must desire for me some of those violent and dangerous diseases from the cure of which so much honor redounds to the physician.”\nAt this moment, and as though the utterance of Villefort’s wish had sufficed to effect its accomplishment, a servant entered the room, and whispered a few words in his ear. Villefort immediately rose from table and quitted the room upon the plea of urgent business; he soon, however, returned, his whole face beaming with delight. Renée regarded him with fond affection; and certainly his handsome features, lit up as they then were with more than usual fire and animation, seemed formed to excite the innocent admiration with which she gazed on her graceful and intelligent lover.",

Go, my son.” “Madame,” said Villefort, “I will go; but do not be uneasy, I will be as lenient as possible.” “But,” said Renée, clasping her hands, “be merciful, be merciful, my dear Gérard, especially to-day.” Villefort approached Renée, and taking her hand, said, “I will be as merciful as possible, my love, for your sake.” Then turning to the marquise, he said, “I must go, mother, the king’s service calls me.” “Go, my son,” said the marquise, “and do your duty.” Villefort kissed the hand of the marquise, and pressing that of Renée, he said, “Adieu, my love, I will return as soon as possible.” And he went out, leaving the two women alone. “Poor Gérard!” said the marquise. “He is so good, so kind.” “Yes,” said Renée, “but he is also so severe.” “It is his duty,” said the marquise. “He is the king’s servant.” “I know,” said Renée, with a sigh. “But I cannot help pitying this unfortunate man.” “You are too sentimental, my child,” said the marquise. “These are state affairs, and you must not meddle with them.” “I know,” said Renée, in a low voice. “But I cannot help it.” “Come, come,” said the marquise, “do not let us talk of such sad things. To-day is a day of rejoicing.” “Alas!” said Renée, “it is a day of sorrow for some one.” “That is true,” said the marquise, “but it is not our fault.” “No,” said Renée, “it is not our fault.” Villefort, on leaving the house, felt a weight lifted from his heart.

It is only the accused person who is in custody, mother.” “Yes, my dear,” said Villefort; “and if the letter had not been received, if the secretary had not been a man of sense, he would probably have escaped.” “And will he be tried?” asked the marquise. “Doubtless.

Now, in spite of the nobility of his countenance, the command of which, like a finished actor, he had carefully studied before the glass, it was by no means easy for him to assume an air of judicial severity. Except the recollection of the line of politics his father had adopted, and which might interfere, unless he acted with the greatest prudence, with his own career, Gérard de Villefort was as happy as a man could be. Already rich, he held a high official situation, though only twenty-seven. He was about to marry a young and charming woman, whom he loved, not passionately, but reasonably, as became a deputy attorney of the king; and besides her personal attractions, which were very great, Mademoiselle de Saint-Méran’s family possessed considerable political influence, which they would, of course, exert in his favor. The dowry of his wife amounted to fifty thousand crowns, and he had, besides, the prospect of seeing her fortune increased to half a million at her father’s death. These considerations naturally gave Villefort a feeling of such complete felicity that his mind was fairly dazzled in its contemplation.\nAt the door he met the commissary of police, who was waiting for him. The sight of this officer recalled Villefort from the third heaven to earth; he composed his face, as we have before described, and said, “I have read the letter, sir, and you have acted rightly in arresting this man; now inform me what you have discovered concerning him and the conspiracy.”\n“We know nothing as yet of the conspiracy, monsieur; all the papers found have been sealed up and placed on your desk. The prisoner himself is named Edmond Dantès, mate on board the three-master the Pharaon, trading in cotton with Alexandria and Smyrna, and belonging to Morrel & Son, of Marseilles.”\n“Before he entered the merchant service, had he ever served in the marines?”\n“Oh, no, monsieur, he is very young.”\n“How old?”\n“Nineteen or twenty at the most.”",

At twenty-seven years of age he was deputy attorney at Aix, and there he maintained a high reputation for sternness, which was increased by a naturally dark complexion and harsh features, a smile seldom, if ever, lightened. This sternness was not only a mask, but also a weapon. With the first, he repelled all attempts at familiarity; with the second, he struck at the guilty. It was a proud position for a young man; and Villefort was proud, not only of his position, but of his father, the Count de Salvieux, and his mother, the daughter of the Marquis de Saint-Méran, a family connected with the first houses in the kingdom. These high connections, joined to a fortune of 50,000 francs which he inherited from his mother, and the prospect of a much larger sum from his father, who was a man of large property, made him one of the most desirable matches in the province. He was, moreover, about to marry Mademoiselle Renée de Saint-Méran, the daughter of the marquis, and his own cousin; a young lady of great beauty, and still greater expectations, for she was the sole heiress of the marquis, who was immensely rich. The marriage was to take place in a few days, and Villefort was already looking forward to the time when he should be attorney-general, and perhaps even minister. The only shadow that darkened his brilliant prospects was the political history of his father, who had been a Girondin, and had voted for the death of Louis XVI. This was a dangerous secret, and Villefort had carefully concealed it. He had even changed his name, and was known only as Villefort. He was, however, a man of great ambition, and he was determined to rise in the world, and to efface the stain on his name by his own services. He was just beginning to revel in the delightful anticipations of his future career, when a knock at the door of his study interrupted his reverie. \"Come in,\" said he, in a firm voice. The door opened, and the commissary of police of the quarter appeared. \"Pardon me, sir,\" said the commissary, \"for disturbing you at this hour, but I have a matter of importance to communicate.\" \"What is it?\" asked Villefort. \"Have you arrested the man?\" \"Yes, sir,\" replied the commissary. \"And what have you done with him?\" \"I have brought him here, sir. He is in the antechamber.\" \"Who is he?\" \"A young man, sir, a sailor, named Edmond Dantès.\" \"Dantès!\" repeated Villefort. \"I know the name.

The commissary retired, and in a few minutes returned, followed by a young man of about nineteen or twenty years of age, with a fine, open countenance, and a frank, fearless air. He was dressed in the costume of a sailor, and held in his hand a cap, which he twirled between his fingers. \"Are you Edmond Dantès?\" asked Villefort. \"Yes, sir,\" replied the young man. \"You are accused of having corresponded with the Isle of Elba.\" \"I, sir?\" said Dantès, with a look of surprise. \"Yes, you. Do you deny it?\" \"I do, sir. I have never corresponded with the Isle of Elba.\" \"But you have been there?\" \"Yes, sir, on the return voyage of the Pharaon.

Villefort traversed the antechamber, cast a side glance at Dantès, and taking a packet which a gendarme offered him, disappeared, saying, “Bring in the prisoner.”\nRapid as had been Villefort’s glance, it had served to give him an idea of the man he was about to interrogate. He had recognized intelligence in the high forehead, courage in the dark eye and bent brow, and frankness in the thick lips that showed a set of pearly teeth. Villefort’s first impression was favorable; but he had been so often warned to mistrust first impulses, that he applied the maxim to the impression, forgetting the difference between the two words. He stifled, therefore, the feelings of compassion that were rising, composed his features, and sat down, grim and sombre, at his desk. An instant after Dantès entered. He was pale, but calm and collected, and saluting his judge with easy politeness, looked round for a seat, as if he had been in M. Morrel’s salon. It was then that he encountered for the first time Villefort’s look,—that look peculiar to the magistrate, who, while seeming to read the thoughts of others, betrays nothing of his own.",

            "Villefort is personally struck by this coincidence, as he too is about to be married, and the irony of his position—destroying another's happiness on the cusp of his own—prompts him to mentally formulate an eloquent remark for a future social occasion.",

Morrel & Son.”\n“Your age?” continued Villefort.\n“Nineteen,” returned Dantès.\n“What were you doing at the moment you were arrested?”\n“I was at the festival of my marriage, monsieur,” said the young man, his voice slightly tremulous, so great was the contrast between that happy moment and the painful ceremony he was now undergoing; so great was the contrast between the sombre aspect of M. de Villefort and the radiant face of Mercédès.\n“You were at the festival of your marriage?” said the deputy, shuddering in spite of himself.\n“Yes, monsieur; I am on the point of marrying a young girl I have been attached to for three years.” Villefort, impassive as he was, was struck with this coincidence; and the tremulous voice of Dantès, surprised in the midst of his happiness, struck a sympathetic chord in his own bosom—he also was on the point of being married, and he was summoned from his own happiness to destroy that of another. “This philosophic reflection,” thought he, “will make a great sensation at M. de Saint-Méran’s;” and he arranged mentally, while Dantès awaited further questions, the antithesis by which orators often create a reputation for eloquence. When this speech was arranged, Villefort turned to Dantès.\n“Go on, sir,” said he.\n“What would you have me say?”\n“Give all the information in your power.”\n“Tell me on which point you desire information, and I will tell all I know; only,” added he, with a smile, “I warn you I know very little.”\n“Have you served under the usurper?”\n“I was about to be mustered into the Royal Marines when he fell.”\n“It is reported your political opinions are extreme,” said Villefort, who had never heard anything of the kind, but was not sorry to make this inquiry, as if it were an accusation.\n“My political opinions!” replied Dantès. “Alas, sir, I never had any opinions. I am hardly nineteen; I know nothing; I have no part to play. If I obtain the situation I desire, I shall owe it to M. Morrel. Thus all my opinions—I will not say public, but private—are confined to these three sentiments,—I love my father, I respect M. Morrel, and I adore Mercédès. This, sir, is all I can tell you, and you see how uninteresting it is.” As Dantès spoke, Villefort gazed at his ingenuous and open countenance, and recollected the words of Renée, who, without knowing who the culprit was, had besought his indulgence for him. With the deputy’s knowledge of crime and criminals, every word the young man uttered convinced him more and more of his innocence. This lad, for he was scarcely a man,—simple, natural, eloquent with that eloquence of the heart never found when sought for; full of affection for everybody, because he was happy, and because happiness renders even the wicked good—extended his affection even to his judge, spite of Villefort’s severe look and stern accent. Dantès seemed full of kindness.\n“Pardieu!” said Villefort, “he is a noble fellow. I hope I shall gain Renée’s favor easily by obeying the first command she ever imposed on me. I shall have at least a pressure of the hand in public, and a sweet kiss in private.” Full of this idea, Villefort’s face became so joyous, that when he turned to Dantès, the latter, who had watched the change on his physiognomy, was smiling also.",

Here is the paper; do you know the writing?” As he spoke, Villefort drew the letter from his pocket, and presented it to Dantès. Dantès read it. A cloud passed over his brow as he said:\n“No, monsieur, I do not know the writing, and yet it is tolerably plain. Whoever did it writes well. I am very fortunate,” added he, looking gratefully at Villefort, “to be examined by such a man as you; for this envious person is a real enemy.” And by the rapid glance that the young man’s eyes shot forth, Villefort saw how much energy lay hid beneath this mildness.\n“Now,” said the deputy, “answer me frankly, not as a prisoner to a judge, but as one man to another who takes an interest in him, what truth is there in the accusation contained in this anonymous letter?” And Villefort threw disdainfully on his desk the letter Dantès had just given back to him.\n“None at all. I will tell you the real facts. I swear by my honor as a sailor, by my love for Mercédès, by the life of my father——”\n“Speak, monsieur,” said Villefort. Then, internally, “If Renée could see me, I hope she would be satisfied, and would no longer call me a decapitator.”\n“Well, when we quitted Naples, Captain Leclere was attacked with a brain fever. As we had no doctor on board, and he was so anxious to arrive at Elba, that he would not touch at any other port, his disorder rose to such a height, that at the end of the third day, feeling he was dying, he called me to him. ‘My dear Dantès,’ said he, ‘swear to perform what I am going to tell you, for it is a matter of the deepest importance.’\n“‘I swear, captain,’ replied I.\n“‘Well, as after my death the command devolves on you as mate, assume the command, and bear up for the Island of Elba, disembark at Porto-Ferrajo, ask for the grand-marshal, give him this letter—perhaps they will give you another letter, and charge you with a commission. You will accomplish what I was to have done, and derive all the honor and profit from it.’\n“‘I will do it, captain; but perhaps I shall not be admitted to the grand-marshal’s presence as easily as you expect?’\n“‘Here is a ring that will obtain audience of him, and remove every difficulty,’ said the captain. At these words he gave me a ring. It was time—two hours after he was delirious; the next day he died.”\n“And what did you do then?”\n“What I ought to have done, and what everyone would have done in my place. Everywhere the last requests of a dying man are sacred; but with a sailor the last requests of his superior are commands. I sailed for the Island of Elba, where I arrived the next day; I ordered everybody to remain on board, and went on shore alone. As I had expected, I found some difficulty in obtaining access to the grand-marshal; but I sent the ring I had received from the captain to him, and was instantly admitted. He questioned me concerning Captain Leclere’s death; and, as the latter had told me, gave me a letter to carry on to a person in Paris. I undertook it because it was what my captain had bade me do. I landed here, regulated the affairs of the vessel, and hastened to visit my affianced bride, whom I found more lovely than ever. Thanks to M. Morrel, all the forms were got over; in a word I was, as I told you, at my marriage feast; and I should have been married in an hour, and tomorrow I intended to start for Paris, had I not been arrested on this charge which you as well as I now see to be unjust.”",

For, in the course of my life, thank God, I have never injured any one intentionally, and, although I am young, I have an established reputation as a loyal, open-hearted man; and that is why,” added Dantès, with a smile, “the worthy M. Morrel obtained for me the promise of the succession to the captaincy of the Pharaon, and why the sailors are so devoted to me.”“Yes, all this is true,” said Villefort, “but the world is so wicked, that an honest, open-hearted man is sure, sooner or later, to have enemies, if only from his success and prosperity. You are about to become captain, you are about to marry a beautiful woman, who loves you; and these two pieces of good fortune may have excited the envy of some one.”“You are right, sir; you are right,” said Dantès; “and perhaps, if I had not been so absorbed in the prospect of my own happiness, I might have perceived that envy was lurking around me.”“However,” continued Villefort, “independently of the enemies your prosperity may have created, have you not some private enemy, some one who has had cause to complain of you? Some one whom you may have offended?”“No, sir, I frankly say, no! On the sea, I have several times been obliged to exercise my authority, as you know a captain must, and I have punished the refractory, but never with undue harshness; I have always been at sea for ten years, and I have never had a complaint entered against me.”“But what of politics?” inquired Villefort. “Have you any political enemies?”“I?” said Dantès; “I have no politics. I am a sailor, a free agent, a man who belongs to no party, except that of humanity. I have never had anything to do with politics.”“But you have been to Elba?” said Villefort, coming to the point. “You stopped at Porto-Ferrajo?”“Yes, sir, I have been to Elba, and I stopped at Porto-Ferrajo; but it was in obedience to the last instructions of my poor captain, who, as I have already told you, was a Royalist, and who, on his death-bed, charged me to deliver a letter to the grand-marshal, who was then at Porto-Ferrajo.”“And this letter,” said Villefort, “was it addressed to the grand-marshal?”“Yes, sir, and to no one else.”“And you delivered it yourself into the grand-marshal’s own hands?”“Yes, sir, I did; and although I had never seen him before, I recognized him at once by the description Captain Leclere had given me.”“And what did the grand-marshal say to you?” asked Villefort, with a look of intense interest.“He thanked me for my punctuality, and told me that he would not forget me; and he gave me a letter to carry to Paris, to a M. Noirtier.”“To M. Noirtier!” exclaimed Villefort, turning pale; “to M. Noirtier, the deputy procureur du roi?”“Yes, sir, to M. Noirtier, the deputy procureur du roi; but he told me that it was a matter of the utmost secrecy, and that I was not to deliver it to any one but M. Noirtier himself.”“And you have this letter?” asked Villefort, with a trembling voice.“No, sir, I have not; I delivered it to M. Noirtier the day after I arrived in Paris.”“And what did M. Noirtier say to you?”“He thanked me very much, and told me that he would not forget me; and he gave me a commission to execute for him in Marseilles.”“And what was this commission?”“To deliver a box to a M. Morrel, a shipowner, who lives on the Quai de la Joliette.”“And you delivered this box?”“Yes, sir, I did; and M. Morrel thanked me very much, and told me that he would not forget me.”“And this is all?” said Villefort, trying to conceal his agitation.“Yes, sir, this is all.”Villefort remained silent for a moment, and then, with a forced smile, he said, “It seems, then, that you are a very fortunate young man, and that you have met with nothing but kindness and good fortune in your life.”“Yes, sir, I have been very fortunate,” replied Dantès, “and I have reason to be grateful to God for his goodness to me.”“But,” said Villefort, “let us return to the anonymous letter. You say that you have no enemies?”“None that I know of, sir.”“It is possible,” said Villefort, “that you may have enemies of whom you are not aware. Envy is a passion that is always at work, and it is often concealed under the mask of friendship or indifference.”“That is true, sir,” said Dantès; “and I have no doubt that I have enemies, but I do not know who they are.”“Well,” said Villefort, “I will show you the letter, and perhaps you may be able to recognize the handwriting.”Villefort took the letter from his desk, and handed it to Dantès. Dantès read it attentively, and then said, “No, sir, I do not recognize the handwriting; it is a feigned hand, and it is evidently written by some one who wishes to injure me.”“It is a base and cowardly act,” said Villefort, “and I will do all in my power to discover the author of it.”“You are very kind, sir,” said Dantès; “and I am very grateful to you for your kindness.”“Do not mention it,” said Villefort; “it is my duty to protect the innocent, and to punish the guilty.”He paused for a moment, and then, looking at Dantès with a searching gaze, he said, “Now, tell me, frankly, as one man to another, and not as a prisoner to his judge, is there any truth in this accusation?”Villefort tossed the letter contemptuously aside as he spoke.Dantès swore by his honor as a sailor, by his love for Mercédès, and by his father’s life, that there was not a word of truth in the accusation.

All my life, until now, I have been happy. I am about to be married to a woman I adore, and who loves me. I have just been promoted to captain. I have friends, good friends, loyal friends. No, sir, I do not think I have a single enemy.”\n\nVillefort looked at him intently. “It is possible,” he said, “that you may have enemies without knowing it. In this world, envy often lurks in the shadows, especially when a young man rises so rapidly and is so fortunate.”\n\n“If that were the case, sir,” replied Dantès, “they have been very discreet, for I have never perceived any ill-will towards me.”\n\n“You mentioned a letter,” Villefort continued, his tone becoming slightly more formal. “A letter entrusted to you by the late Captain Leclère?”\n\n“Yes, sir. On his deathbed, he gave me a packet and asked me to deliver it to a certain Monsieur Noirtier in Paris.”\n\nVillefort started slightly. His eyes, which had been calm and scrutinizing, suddenly widened with a flicker of alarm that he instantly suppressed. “Monsieur Noirtier?” he repeated, his voice carefully neutral. “Do you know this Monsieur Noirtier?”\n\n“No, sir, I do not. Captain Leclère merely gave me his name and address.”\n\n“And where is this letter now?”\n\n“It is in my pocket, sir,” said Dantès, reaching into his jacket. He produced a sealed packet, which he handed to Villefort.\n\nVillefort took the packet. His hand trembled almost imperceptibly as he examined the address: “To Monsieur Noirtier, Rue Coq-Héron, No. 13, Paris.” He recognized the handwriting instantly. It was his father’s. His father, a staunch Bonapartist, a man whose political views were in direct opposition to his own carefully cultivated royalist facade, a man whose activities he had always feared would compromise his own career. And this letter, brought from Elba, from the very island where Napoleon was exiled, addressed to his father… The implications struck him like a physical blow.\n\nHis mind raced. If this letter were delivered, if its contents were revealed, his father would be implicated in a Bonapartist conspiracy. And if his father were implicated, his own position, his future, everything he had worked for, would be destroyed. He, the deputy procureur du roi, the man who was building his career on loyalty to the Bourbons, could not afford to have a father known to be corresponding with agents from Elba.\n\nA cold, calculating resolve settled over him. This young man, Dantès, was a mere pawn, an unfortunate messenger. His fate was insignificant compared to the potential ruin that threatened Villefort’s own ambitions. Justice, truth, innocence – these were abstract concepts that paled before the concrete reality of his career and his family’s name (at least, the part of the family"

Noirtier?”\n“Everybody, except the person who gave it to me.”\n“And that was too much, far too much,” murmured Villefort. Villefort’s brow darkened more and more, his white lips and clenched teeth filled Dantès with apprehension. After reading the letter, Villefort covered his face with his hands.\n“Oh,” said Dantès timidly, “what is the matter?” Villefort made no answer, but raised his head at the expiration of a few seconds, and again perused the letter.\n“And you say that you are ignorant of the contents of this letter?”\n“I give you my word of honor, sir,” said Dantès; “but what is the matter?

It is for me to give orders here, and not you.”\n“Monsieur,” replied Dantès proudly, “it was only to summon assistance for you.”\n“I want none; it was a temporary indisposition. Attend to yourself; answer me.” Dantès waited, expecting a question, but in vain. Villefort fell back on his chair, passed his hand over his brow, moist with perspiration, and, for the third time, read the letter.\n“Oh, if he knows the contents of this!” murmured he, “and that Noirtier is the father of Villefort, I am lost!” And he fixed his eyes upon Edmond as if he would have penetrated his thoughts.\n“Oh, it is impossible to doubt it,” cried he, suddenly.",

If you are innocent, as you appear to be, I will not detain you longer; but you understand, that in the interest of the king, in the interest of justice, I must retain this letter.” “Yes, sir,” returned Dantès; “you are the king’s servant, and must do his pleasure; do mine, which is to set me at liberty, and I will pray for you all my life.” “The letter,” said Villefort, “was in your possession?” “Yes, sir.” “Read by you?” “No, sir, never.” “Did you know the contents?” “I was ignorant, sir.” “Did you suspect them?” “No, sir.” “Hand me the letter, then, and you are free.” “You have it, sir, it is in that packet.” Villefort stretched out his hand, took the packet, and searched in it for the letter, which he found. It was, as Dantès had said, the one he had given to the supercargo. Villefort took it, opened it, and read as follows:— “M. NOIRTIER, RUE COQ-HÉRON, NO. 13, PARIS. “The usurper landed the 28th of February, and is marching upon Paris. The royal court is preparing to leave. Toulon and Antibes will furnish him with arms and ammunition. Marseilles is forming a league of royalists.

Noirtier, Rue Coq-Héron, No. 13, Paris.” Villefort had, until then, preserved an admirable self-possession, and his countenance had expressed nothing but the calm severity of the magistrate, who was obliged to interrogate a man accused of crime, a simple formality, no doubt, but still a formality. He had even waited patiently for the end of Dantès’ speech, but when he heard the name of Noirtier, he knit his brow as if a sudden pain had shot through his head, and rose from his seat with a convulsive motion. “Noirtier!” he ejaculated, “Noirtier! is this letter addressed to M. Noirtier?” “Yes, sir,” replied Dantès, “do you know him?” “No,” replied Villefort, turning pale, “a faithful servant of the king does not know conspirators.” “It is a conspiracy, then?” asked Dantès, who, as we have said, had not read the letter, and could not, therefore, guess its contents. “Yes,” said Villefort, “a conspiracy, which, if it had broken out in Paris, would have inundated France with blood.” “But I have told you, sir,” said Dantès, “that I was ignorant of the contents of the letter.” “Yes,” said Villefort, “but you knew the name of the person to whom it was addressed.” “Yes, sir, I learned it from the address.” “And you did not know that he was a conspirator?” “No, sir; I repeat, I was ignorant of the contents of the letter and of the character of the person to whom it was addressed. This letter was given to me by the captain of the Pharaon, who desired me to deliver it to M. Noirtier at Paris.” “And there was no other paper?” said Villefort. “No, sir, none.” “And you are sure it was for M. Noirtier at Paris?” “Yes, sir,” replied Dantès; “Rue Coq-Héron, No. 13.” Villefort seized the letter, and again cast his eyes over the address, and then read the first words, “M.

Noirtier, at Paris. Besides, fear will render Dantès eloquent, and",

The air seemed thick, suffocating him. That man, that Count of Monte Cristo, knew! He knew the terrible secret buried in the garden at Auteuil. How could he know? Who was this man? His memory raced back, searching for a face, a name, anything that could explain this impossible knowledge. Could it be? No, it was madness. Dantes was dead, buried in the Chateau d'If. Yet, the Count's eyes, his calm, knowing demeanor, the chilling precision of his words... it was as if the past had risen from its grave, embodied in this mysterious stranger. Villefort felt a cold dread seize him, a premonition of ruin. The ground beneath him seemed to crumble."

A door that communicated with the Palais de Justice was opened, and they went through a long range of gloomy corridors, whose appearance might have made even the boldest shudder. The Palais de Justice communicated with the prison,—a sombre edifice, that from its grated windows looks on the clock-tower of the Accoules. After numberless windings, Dantès saw a door with an iron wicket. The commissary took up an iron mallet and knocked thrice, every blow seeming to Dantès as if struck on his heart. The door opened, the two gendarmes gently pushed him forward, and the door closed with a loud sound behind him. The air he inhaled was no longer pure, but thick and mephitic,—he was in prison.\nHe was conducted to a tolerably neat chamber, but grated and barred, and its appearance, therefore, did not greatly alarm him; besides, the words of Villefort, who seemed to interest himself so much, resounded still in his ears like a promise of freedom. It was four o’clock when Dantès was placed in this chamber. It was, as we have said, the 1st of March, and the prisoner was soon buried in darkness. The obscurity augmented the acuteness of his hearing; at the slightest sound he rose and hastened to the door, convinced they were about to liberate him, but the sound died away, and Dantès sank again into his seat.

It was the court of the Palais de Justice. A carriage was waiting there, into which Dantès was requested to enter. “No,” he said, “I prefer walking.

They stood framed in the doorway, their faces grim and impassive, casting long, dancing shadows into the festive room.  The joyous chatter of the wedding guests died down, replaced by a stunned silence.  Mercédès, her face paling instantly, clutched his arm, her eyes wide with terror.  Old Dantès rose shakily from his chair, his hand trembling.  The leader of the gendarmes stepped forward, his voice flat and official.  “Edmond Dantès?” he asked, though his gaze left no doubt.  Dantès, finding his voice, though it sounded strange and distant, replied, “I am he. What is the meaning of this?”  The gendarme produced a paper. “Edmond Dantès, ship’s mate of the Pharaon, you are arrested by order of the deputy procureur du roi.”  Arrested? On his wedding day? Surrounded by friends and family? It seemed an impossible nightmare.  He looked from the stern faces of the gendarmes to the horrified countenances of his loved ones.  “But why? What have I done?” he stammered, his mind racing, searching for a reason, any reason, for this sudden, brutal intrusion into his happiness.  The gendarme offered no explanation, only a curt gesture towards the door.  The dream was shattered."

The two gendarmes who were opposite to him descended first, then he was ordered to alight and the gendarmes on each side of him followed his example. They advanced towards a boat, which a custom-house officer held by a chain, near the quay.\nThe soldiers looked at Dantès with an air of stupid curiosity. In an instant he was placed in the stern-sheets of the boat, between the gendarmes, while the officer stationed himself at the bow; a shove sent the boat adrift, and four sturdy oarsmen impelled it rapidly towards the Pilon. At a shout from the boat, the chain that closes the mouth of the port was lowered and in a second they were, as Dantès knew, in the Frioul and outside the inner harbor.\nThe prisoner’s first feeling was of joy at again breathing the pure air—for air is freedom; but he soon sighed, for he passed before La Réserve, where he had that morning been so happy, and now through the open windows came the laughter and revelry of a ball. Dantès folded his hands, raised his eyes to heaven, and prayed fervently.\nThe boat continued her voyage.

The boat they were in could not make a long voyage; there was no vessel at anchor outside the harbor; he thought, perhaps, they were going to leave him on some distant point. He was not bound, nor had they made any attempt to handcuff him; this seemed a good augury. Besides, had not the deputy, who had been so kind to him, told him that provided he did not pronounce the dreaded name of Noirtier, he had nothing to apprehend? Had not Villefort in his presence destroyed the fatal letter, the only proof against him?\nHe waited silently, striving to pierce through the darkness.\nThey had left the Ile Ratonneau, where the lighthouse stood, on the right, and were now opposite the Point des Catalans. It seemed to the prisoner that he could distinguish a feminine form on the beach, for it was there Mercédès dwelt. How was it that a presentiment did not warn Mercédès that her lover was within three hundred yards of her?\nOne light alone was visible; and Dantès saw that it came from Mercédès’ chamber. Mercédès was the only one awake in the whole settlement. A loud cry could be heard by her. But pride restrained him and he did not utter it. What would his guards think if they heard him shout like a madman?\nHe remained silent, his eyes fixed upon the light; the boat went on, but the prisoner thought only of Mercédès. An intervening elevation of land hid the light. Dantès turned and perceived that they had got out to sea.

It was a considerable force, and the young man wondered if such preparations were requisite to take a simple ship’s mate to the Palais de Justice. The officer opened the door, and a voice bade Dantès alight. He did so, and found himself in the midst of a double rank of soldiers. A passage was formed, down which he walked, preceded by two gendarmes, followed by two others; the officer closed the march. They took the way to the port, and Dantès perceived a boat held by a custom-house officer, who was waiting for them on the quay. The soldiers looked at him with the curiosity natural to men to whom a spectacle is a relief, and who do not speculate on the cause, but only contemplate the effect. The boat was painted black, and seemed built for swiftness; it could carry about a dozen men, and was rigged with a single mast. In the stern sheets were two gendarmes, who made room for Dantès between them; the officer placed himself in the bow; the four oarsmen took their places, and in a moment the boat was pushed off from the land. The noise of the oars, as they struck the water with measured time, seemed to Dantès like the beating of a funeral march; and indeed, how little did he imagine that the watery grave was before him! He at first wished to address the officer, but he saw by his countenance that he was not an ordinary agent, and he remained silent, thinking that the moment to speak had not arrived. The boat flew like a bird. In a moment they had passed the Pilon, and were making towards the Pointe des Catalans. Then Dantès saw a light, and that light was from the lamp of a fisherman’s hut. “Ah,” thought he, “it is the hut of old Père Jacquot, who has often taken me fishing with him.” He looked again; the light disappeared. They had passed the Pointe des Catalans. The boat rowed on. Dantès thought that they were going to the Château d’If, and the idea made his blood run cold. But the boat passed the Château d’If, and went on. “Where are we going?” asked Dantès. “You will see,” replied the officer. Dantès was silent. The boat still went on. It passed the Ile Ratonneau, and then the Ile Pomègues. “Where are we going?” asked Dantès again. “To the Château d’If,” replied the officer. Dantès shuddered. The boat stopped. It was alongside a rock. A ladder was lowered. “Go up,” said the officer. Dantès obeyed. He found himself on a platform. A door opened, and he entered a passage. At the end of the passage was a staircase. He went up the staircase. At the top of the staircase was a door. It opened, and he entered a room. In the room was a bed, a table, and a chair. On the table was a lamp. The officer entered after him. “This is your room,” said he. “You will remain here until further orders.” He went out, and the door was locked. Dantès was alone. He looked around him. The room was small and dark. The walls were damp. The air was cold. He sat down on the bed. He buried his face in his hands. He wept. He wept for a long time.

                "text": "The carriage stopped, the officer descended, approached the guardhouse, a dozen soldiers came out and formed themselves in order; Dantès saw the reflection of their muskets by the light of the lamps on the quay. It was a considerable force, and the young man wondered if such preparations were requisite to take a simple ship’s mate to the Palais de Justice. The officer opened the door, and a voice bade Dantès alight. He did so, and found himself in the midst of a double rank of soldiers. A passage was formed, down which he walked, preceded by two gendarmes, followed by two others; the officer closed the march. They took the way to the port, and Dantès perceived a boat held by a custom-house officer, who was waiting for them on the quay. The soldiers looked at him with the curiosity natural to men to whom a spectacle is a relief, and who do not speculate on the cause, but only contemplate the effect. The boat was painted black, and seemed built for swiftness; it could carry about a dozen men, and was rigged with a single mast. In the stern sheets were two gendarmes, who made room for Dantès between them; the officer placed himself in the bow; the four oarsmen took their places, and in a moment the boat was pushed off from the land. The noise of the oars, as they struck the water with measured time, seemed to Dantès like the beating of a funeral march; and indeed, how little did he imagine that the watery grave was before him! He at first wished to address the officer, but he saw by his countenance that he was not an ordinary agent, and he remained silent, thinking that the moment to speak had not arrived. The boat flew like a bird. In a moment they had passed the Pilon, and were making towards the Pointe des Catalans. Then Dantès saw a light, and that light was from the lamp of a fisherman’s hut. “Ah,” thought he, “it is the hut of old Père Jacquot, who has often taken me fishing with him.” He looked again; the light disappeared. They had passed the Pointe des Catalans. The boat rowed on. Dantès thought that they were going to the Château d’If, and the idea made his blood run cold. But the boat passed the Château d’If, and went on. “Where are we going?” asked Dantès. “You will see,” replied the officer. Dantès was silent. The boat still went on. It passed the Ile Ratonneau, and then the Ile Pomègues. “Where are we going?” asked Dantès again. “To the Château d’If,” replied the officer. Dantès shuddered. The boat stopped. It was alongside a rock. A ladder was lowered. “Go up,” said the officer. Dantès obeyed. He found himself on a platform. A door opened, and he entered a passage. At the end of the passage was a staircase. He went up the staircase. At the top of the staircase was a door. It opened, and he entered a room. In the room was a bed, a table, and a chair. On the table was a lamp. The officer entered after him. “This is your room,” said he. “You will remain here until further orders.” He went out, and the door was locked. Dantès was alone. He looked around him. The room was small and dark. The walls were damp. The air was cold. He sat down on the bed. He buried his face in his hands. He wept. He wept for a long time. When he raised his head, the lamp was burning low. He looked at the door. It was locked. He was a prisoner. He was in the Château d’If. He was in the most terrible prison in France.

            "prefix-probing": "The carriage stopped, the officer descended, approached the guardhouse, a dozen soldiers came out and formed themselves in order; Dantès saw the reflection of their muskets by the light of the lamps on the quay. His heart, which had been beating with a vague apprehension since he was taken from the Rue du Cours, now seemed to stop entirely. He felt a cold dread creep over him, a premonition of disaster far worse than anything he could have imagined. The officer returned to the carriage door, his face grim and impassive in the flickering light. “Edmond Dantès,” he said, his voice formal and devoid of emotion, “in the name of the law, I arrest you.”\n\nDantès stared at him, stunned. “Arrest me? On what charge?” he stammered, his voice barely a whisper. The officer offered no explanation, merely gesturing to the soldiers. Two of them stepped forward and opened the carriage door. “Descend, sir,” the officer commanded. Dantès, still reeling from the shock, mechanically obeyed. As he stepped onto the cold, damp stones of the quay, he felt the eyes of the soldiers upon him, their faces indistinct shadows beneath their shakos. He looked back towards the carriage, hoping to see a familiar face, a sign of support, but there was only the empty interior and the impassive driver.\n\nHe was led between the two soldiers towards a small boat moored at the quay. The air was heavy with the smell of salt and seaweed, a smell that usually brought him comfort and a sense of belonging, but which now seemed alien and menacing. He glanced back at the city lights, twinkling in the distance, a world of warmth and life from which he was being abruptly severed. He thought of Mercédès, waiting for him, perhaps still celebrating their engagement, unaware of the catastrophe that had befallen him. The thought was a sharp pain in his chest.\n\nThey boarded the boat. The officer and a few soldiers followed. The oarsmen pushed off from the quay, and the boat glided silently across the dark water. Dantès watched the lights of Marseille recede, growing smaller and smaller until they were just a faint glow on the horizon. The silence in the boat was broken only by the rhythmic dip of the oars and the gentle lapping of the waves against the hull. He tried to speak, to ask again why he was being arrested, but the words caught in his throat. He felt utterly alone, adrift in a nightmare.\n\nAfter what seemed an eternity, a dark, imposing shape loomed out of the darkness ahead. As they drew closer, Dantès recognized it with a sickening certainty: the Château d'If. The island fortress, a grim sentinel guarding the entrance to the harbor, a place of legend and fear, where political prisoners and the most dangerous criminals were confined. He had sailed past it countless times, never imagining he would one day be taken inside its forbidding walls. The boat approached a small landing stage at the base of the rock. Soldiers were waiting there, their figures silhouetted against the faint light from the fortress windows high above.\n\nHe was helped out of the boat, his legs stiff and unsteady. He stumbled slightly, and a soldier's hand gripped his arm roughly, steadying him. He was led up a steep, narrow path carved into the rock. The air grew colder, heavier. The silence was absolute, broken only by the sound of their footsteps and the distant cry of a seabird. They passed through a heavy, iron-studded gate, which clanged shut behind them with a sound that echoed ominously in the stone passageway. He was inside the Château d'If. The reality of his situation crashed down upon him with crushing force. He was a prisoner, in the most infamous prison in France, with no idea why or for how long. Despair, cold and absolute, began to settle in his soul."

Dantes, still encased in the sack intended for his watery grave, felt the jolt resonate through his bruised body. He knew this was his one chance. The men who had carried him would likely depart quickly, leaving the 'corpse' to the elements. With a surge of desperate strength, he began to writhe, pushing against the rough canvas, seeking any weakness, any tear. The weight of the cannonball tied to his feet dragged him down, but the sack, perhaps snagged on a rock or the seabed, offered a momentary resistance to the full descent. He clawed and tore, his fingers finding purchase on the coarse material. The salt water filled his mouth and nose, a bitter taste of near-death, but the urgency of survival fueled his efforts. Finally, with a supreme effort, he ripped a hole large enough to thrust his head through. He gasped for air, the cold night wind a shock against his face. Then, working frantically, he managed to free his arms, untying the ropes that bound him. The sack fell away, and he kicked violently, shedding the leaden weight of the cannonball. He rose to the surface, sputtering, alive. The stars, cold and distant, were the first sight of his new world. He was free, but adrift in the vast, dark sea."

One thought in particular tormented him: namely, that during his journey hither he had sat so still, whereas he might, a dozen times, have plunged into the sea, and, thanks to his powers of swimming, for which he was famous, have gained the shore, concealed himself until the arrival of a Genoese or Spanish vessel, escaped to Spain or Italy, where Mercédès and his father could have joined him. He had no fears as to how he should live—good seamen are welcome everywhere. He spoke Italian like a Tuscan, and Spanish like a Castilian; he would have been free, and happy with Mercédès and his father, whereas he was now confined in the Château d’If, that impregnable fortress, ignorant of the future destiny of his father and Mercédès; and all this because he had trusted to Villefort’s promise.

I wish to see him at once.”\n“Ah,” said the jailer, “do not always brood over what is impossible, or you will be mad in a fortnight.”",

Renée was, with all the rest of the company, anxiously awaiting him, and his entrance was followed by a general exclamation.\n“Well, Decapitator, Guardian of the State, Royalist, Brutus, what is the matter?” said one. “Speak out.”\n“Are we threatened with a fresh Reign of Terror?” asked another.\n“Has the Corsican ogre broken loose?” cried a third.\n“Marquise,” said Villefort, approaching his future mother-in-law, “I request your pardon for thus leaving you. Will the marquis honor me by a few moments’ private conversation?”\n“Ah, it is really a serious matter, then?” asked the marquis, remarking the cloud on Villefort’s brow.\n“So serious that I must take leave of you for a few days; so,” added he, turning to Renée, “judge for yourself if it be not important.”\n“You are going to leave us?” cried Renée, unable to hide her emotion at this unexpected announcement.\n“Alas,” returned Villefort, “I must!”\n“Where, then, are you going?” asked the marquise.\n“That, madame, is an official secret; but if you have any commissions for Paris, a friend of mine is going there tonight, and will with pleasure undertake them.” The guests looked at each other.\n“You wish to speak to me alone?” said the marquis.\n“Yes, let us go to the library, please.” The marquis took his arm, and they left the salon.\n“Well,” asked he, as soon as they were by themselves, “tell me what it is?”\n“An affair of the greatest importance, that demands my immediate presence in Paris. Now, excuse the indiscretion, marquis, but have you any landed property?”\n“All my fortune is in the funds; seven or eight hundred thousand francs.”\n“Then sell out—sell out, marquis, or you will lose it all.”\n“But how can I sell out here?”\n“You have a broker, have you not?”\n“Yes.”\n“Then give me a letter to him, and tell him to sell out without an instant’s delay, perhaps even now I shall arrive too late.”\n“The deuce you say!” replied the marquis, “let us lose no time, then!”\nAnd, sitting down, he wrote a letter to his broker, ordering him to sell out at the market price.\n“Now, then,” said Villefort, placing the letter in his pocketbook, “I must have another!”\n“To whom?”\n“To the king.”\n“To the king?”\n“Yes.”\n“I dare not write to his majesty.”\n“I do not ask you to write to his majesty, but ask M. de Salvieux to do so. I want a letter that will enable me to reach the king’s presence without all the formalities of demanding an audience; that would occasion a loss of precious time.”\n“But address yourself to the keeper of the seals; he has the right of entry at the Tuileries, and can procure you audience at any hour of the day or night.”\n“Doubtless; but there is no occasion to divide the honors of my discovery with him. The keeper would leave me in the background, and take all the glory to himself. I tell you, marquis, my fortune is made if I only reach the Tuileries the first, for the king will not forget the service I do him.”\n“In that case go and get ready. I will call Salvieux and make him write the letter.”\n“Be as quick as possible, I must be on the road in a quarter of an hour.”\n“Tell your coachman to stop at the door.”\n“You will present my excuses to the marquise and Mademoiselle Renée, whom I leave on such a day with great regret.”\n“You will find them both here, and can make your farewells in person.”\n“A thousand thanks—and now for the letter.”\nThe marquis rang, a servant entered.\n“Say to the Comte de Salvieux that I would like to see him.”\n“Now, then, go,” said the marquis.\n“I shall be gone only a few moments.",

A murmur of surprise accompanied the entrance of the young man, who was thus returning to the house of his affianced wife at so unusual an hour. He was in deep mourning, and the paleness of his face and the contraction of his features showed that he had undergone some very serious event. The Marquise, who was at one end of the salon, perceived him as he entered, and seeing his disturbed look, cried out, “Good heavens, M. de Villefort, what is the matter? Is the king dead, or is there another revolution?” And all the guests arose and surrounded Villefort, inquiring with anxiety the cause of his sudden return. Renée, pale and motionless, was leaning on the arm of her mother; she questioned him with her eyes, but could not utter a word. Villefort’s look was fixed on her, and there was in it that dark expression which at times crossed his countenance and almost transformed him. “Pardon me, madame,” said he, addressing the Marquise, “for thus breaking in upon you; but I had a most important communication to make to M. le Marquis.” “Go, then, my dear Villefort,” said M. de Saint-Méran; “I am at your service.” And he took the arm of Villefort, and they passed into the library. As soon as they were alone, “Marquis,” said Villefort, “excuse my abruptness; but I must leave you in an hour.” “To leave us!” cried M. de Saint-Méran, “to leave us when we expected to keep you for a week at least? This is another proof of the instability of human affairs. Renée will not be pleased with you.” “Alas, my dear marquis,” said Villefort, “that is the least of my troubles. A great misfortune has happened, or rather, I should say, a great danger threatens us. I am obliged to go to Paris immediately.” “To Paris! Immediately!” said M. de Saint-Méran. “But the wedding, the contract?” “Do not let us think of that now, marquis,” said Villefort; “I tell you that a great danger threatens us. Perhaps it is already too late. What I have to tell you is a secret of state, a secret of the most vital importance. I cannot tell you more here. I must go to Paris, and that without losing a moment. I must see the king, and that before any one else.” “But how will you see the king?” said M. de Saint-Méran. “You have no appointment, and you know how difficult it is to obtain an audience.” “I know it, marquis,” said Villefort; “but I have a means of obtaining one. I have a letter from the minister of police, which will procure me an immediate audience.” “Indeed!” said M. de Saint-Méran. “Then it must be something very serious.” “It is, marquis,” said Villefort. “It is a matter of life and death, not only for me, but for you, for all of us, for France.” “Good heavens!” said M. de Saint-Méran. “What can it be?” “I cannot tell you here, marquis,” said Villefort. “But I must ask you to do me a great service. You have, I believe, a considerable sum in the funds?” “Yes,” said M. de Saint-Méran, “about a million.” “Well, marquis,” said Villefort, “sell it, and that immediately.” “Sell it!” cried M. de Saint-Méran. “But why?” “Because,” said Villefort, “if you do not, you will lose it all. The funds will fall to nothing.” “But what can cause such a fall?” said M. de Saint-Méran. “I cannot tell you, marquis,” said Villefort. “But believe me, I know what I am saying.

I must be the first to inform him of what has happened.” “But why are you so anxious to be the first?” said M. de Saint-Méran. “Because, marquis,” said Villefort, with a smile that was not natural to him, “because I wish to have the sole merit of this discovery. I wish to be the saviour of the monarchy. I wish to make my fortune at a single stroke.” “Ah, I understand,” said M. de Saint-Méran. “You are ambitious.” “Yes, marquis,” said Villefort, “I am ambitious.

His face was so pale, his eyes so wild, and his whole demeanor so agitated, that a general exclamation of surprise and alarm greeted him. Madame de Saint-Méran, seated on a sofa, rose with difficulty, her hand pressed to her side. The doctor, M. d’Avrigny, who was among the guests, immediately approached Villefort.\n\n“Good heavens, M. de Villefort!” cried Madame de Saint-Méran. “What has happened? You look as though you have seen a ghost!”\n\nVillefort could scarcely speak. He leaned against the doorframe, his breath coming in short, sharp gasps. “A misfortune, madame… a terrible misfortune…”\n\nThe guests gathered around him, their faces reflecting the general anxiety. M. d’Avrigny took his arm. “Compose yourself, M. de Villefort. Tell us what has occurred.”\n\n“My father… M. Noirtier…” Villefort stammered, then stopped, unable to articulate the full horror of the scene he had just witnessed at the Rue du Faubourg Saint-Honoré.\n\nJust as he was about to force the words out, a piercing shriek echoed from the floor above. It was followed by a commotion of hurried footsteps and frightened cries. Madame de Saint-Méran, already frail, swayed and would have fallen had not M. d’Avrigny caught her.\n\n“What is that?” she gasped, her eyes wide with terror.\n\nBefore anyone could answer, a servant rushed into the salon, his face ashen. “Madame! Madame is taken ill! Quickly, M. le Docteur!”\n\nM. d’Avrigny needed no second bidding. He released Madame de Saint-Méran into the care of her husband, the Marquis, and hurried towards the stairs, followed by Villefort and several others. They found Madame de Saint-Méran’s mother, the Marquise, lying on a couch, writhing in pain. Her face was contorted, her lips blue, and a cold sweat beaded on her forehead.\n\nM. d’Avrigny immediately began his examination. He asked rapid questions of the servants and the Marquise’s lady’s maid, who stood by, weeping hysterically. The symptoms were alarming: sudden, violent spasms, intense pain in the stomach, difficulty breathing. It was clear this was no ordinary illness.\n\nVillefort, forgetting his own distress for a moment, watched the doctor with a growing sense of dread. The Marquise, who had been in perfect health only moments before, was clearly dying.\n\nM. d’Avrigny administered what remedies he could, but they seemed to have little effect. The Marquise’s condition worsened rapidly. She clutched at her throat, her eyes fixed and staring. In a final, desperate effort, she tried to speak, but only an inarticulate gurgle escaped her lips.\n\nA few minutes later, with a final, convulsive shudder, the Marquise de Saint-Méran breathed her last. A profound silence fell over the room, broken only by the sobs of the servants and the low moan of the Marquis.\n\nM. d’Avrigny stood up, his face grave. He looked from the deceased to the assembled family and guests. “This is most extraordinary,” he murmured, more to himself than to them. “The suddenness… the violence of the symptoms…”\n\nVillefort, his mind reeling from the double shock of his father’s condition and now the death of his prospective mother-in-law, felt a cold hand grip his heart. Two deaths in such quick succession, both under strange circumstances. The Marquis de Saint-Méran, overcome with grief, knelt beside his wife’s body, burying his face in his hands.\n\nM. d’Avrigny, ever the professional, began to give instructions for the necessary arrangements. But his eyes held a look of deep suspicion. He had seen such symptoms before, or read of them in medical texts. They pointed to one terrible conclusion,"

          "text_segment": "Villefort hastily quitted the apartment, but reflecting that the sight of the deputy procureur running through the streets would be enough to throw the whole city into confusion, he resumed his ordinary pace. At his door he perceived a figure in the shadow that seemed to wait for him. It was Mercédès, who, hearing no news of her lover, had come unobserved to inquire after him.\nAs Villefort drew near, she advanced and stood before him. Dantès had spoken of Mercédès, and Villefort instantly recognized her. Her beauty and high bearing surprised him, and when she inquired what had become of her lover, it seemed to him that she was the judge, and he the accused.\n“The young man you speak of,” said Villefort abruptly, “is a great criminal, and I can do nothing for him, mademoiselle.” Mercédès burst into tears, and, as Villefort strove to pass her, again addressed him.\n“But, at least, tell me where he is, that I may know whether he is alive or dead,” said she.\n“I do not know; he is no longer in my hands,” replied Villefort.\nAnd desirous of putting an end to the interview, he pushed by her, and closed the door, as if to exclude the pain he felt. But remorse is not thus banished; like Virgil’s wounded hero, he carried the arrow in his wound, and, arrived at the salon, Villefort uttered a sigh that was almost a sob, and sank into a chair.\nThen the first pangs of an unending torture seized upon his heart. The man he sacrificed to his ambition, that innocent victim immolated on the altar of his father’s faults, appeared to him pale and threatening, leading his affianced bride by the hand, and bringing with him remorse, not such as the ancients figured, furious and terrible, but that slow and consuming agony whose pangs are intensified from hour to hour up to the very moment of death. Then he had a moment’s hesitation. He had frequently called for capital punishment on criminals, and owing to his irresistible eloquence they had been condemned, and yet the slightest shadow of remorse had never clouded Villefort’s brow, because they were guilty; at least, he believed so; but here was an innocent man whose happiness he had destroyed. In this case he was not the judge, but the executioner.\nAs he thus reflected, he felt the sensation we have described, and which had hitherto been unknown to him, arise in his bosom, and fill him with vague apprehensions. It is thus that a wounded man trembles instinctively at the approach of the finger to his wound until it be healed, but Villefort’s was one of those that never close, or if they do, only close to reopen more agonizing than ever. If at this moment the sweet voice of Renée had sounded in his ears pleading for mercy, or the fair Mercédès had entered and said, “In the name of God, I conjure you to restore me my affianced husband,” his cold and trembling hands would have signed his release; but no voice broke the stillness of the chamber, and the door was opened only by Villefort’s valet, who came to tell him that the travelling carriage was in readiness.",

Villefort felt a chill run through him at this sudden apparition, and endeavoured to pass on, but the woman, whose face was covered with a veil, and whom he could not distinguish in the darkness, stepped in front of him. “Monsieur de Villefort,” said she, in a low voice. “You wish to speak to me?” said the young man. “Yes,” she replied; “but if it be a crime, it is you who have committed it—not I.” Villefort drew back, but the woman, who had followed him, and had again stopped him, said, “Monsieur de Villefort, you are the deputy procureur.” “You are mistaken, madame,” replied Villefort; “I am not the person you take me for.” “No,” said the woman, with a mournful smile, “I am not mistaken; you are Monsieur de Villefort, the deputy procureur, and you are going to marry Mademoiselle de Saint-Méran, and your father is the Count Noirtier.” “Silence, madame! silence!” cried Villefort; “do not utter that name.” “Why should I be silent?” said the woman; “why should I not speak of him? Is he not my betrothed?” “Your betrothed!” cried Villefort, starting back. “Yes,” said she; “and I ask you what you have done with him?” “With whom?” “With Edmond Dantès, who was to be my husband in a week, and who is now, perhaps, dead or a prisoner.” “Edmond Dantès,” repeated Villefort, almost mechanically; “he is a great criminal, and I can do nothing for him.” “A great criminal!” cried Mercédès; “Monsieur de Villefort, you know that he is innocent; you know that he is a good and noble young man.” “I know nothing about it, madame,” said Villefort; “I only know that he has been arrested, and that he is in prison.” “But where is he? where is he?” cried Mercédès; “tell me, I implore you, where he is, and I will bless you.” “I do not know,” said Villefort; “he is no longer under my authority.” “But he is alive? he is alive?” cried Mercédès. “I do not know,” said Villefort; “I have no information about him.” Mercédès uttered a cry, and fell on her knees. “Oh, Monsieur de Villefort,” said she, “have pity on me! tell me if he is alive.” “I can tell you nothing, madame,” said Villefort; “I must go; I am expected.” He made a movement to pass, but Mercédès, who had risen, held him back. “Monsieur de Villefort,” said she, “you are a man of honor, you are a Christian; tell me, on your soul, if Edmond Dantès is alive.” “I do not know,” said Villefort, in a voice that was almost inaudible; “I do not know.” He pushed her gently aside, and hurried on. Mercédès fell back on the pavement, and burst into tears. Villefort entered his house, and threw himself into a chair, overcome by emotion. He felt that he had committed a great crime, and that he was a miserable wretch. He thought of Mercédès, of her beauty, of her grief, and he felt a pang of remorse. He had sacrificed an innocent man to his ambition, to his father’s past, and he knew that he should never be happy again. He was no longer a judge, but an executioner. A cold sweat covered his brow, and he felt a profound sense of apprehension, a feeling he had never experienced before. He thought that if Renée or Mercédès had at that moment entered, and said, “Save him!” he would have ordered Dantès to be set at liberty.

Is he not my betrothed?” “Your betrothed!” cried Villefort, starting back. “Yes,” said she; “and I ask you what you have done with him?” “With whom?” “With Edmond Dantès, who was to be my husband in a week, and who is now, perhaps, dead or a prisoner.” “Edmond Dantès,” repeated Villefort, almost mechanically; “he is a great criminal, and I can do nothing for him.” “A great criminal!” cried Mercédès; “Monsieur de Villefort, you know that he is innocent; you know that he is a good and noble young man.” “I know nothing about it, madame,” said Villefort; “I only know that he has been arrested, and that he is in prison.” “But where is he? where is he?” cried Mercédès; “tell me, I implore you, where he is, and I will bless you.” “I do not know,” said Villefort; “he is no longer under my authority.” “But he is alive? he is alive?” cried Mercédès. “I do not know,” said Villefort; “I have no information about him.” Mercédès uttered a cry, and fell on her knees. “Oh, Monsieur de Villefort,” said she, “have pity on me! tell me if he is alive.” “I can tell you nothing, madame,” said Villefort; “I must go; I am expected.” He made a movement to pass, but Mercédès, who had risen, held him back. “Monsieur de Villefort,” said she, “you are a man of honor, you are a Christian; tell me, on your soul, if Edmond Dantès is alive.” “I do not know,” said Villefort, in a voice that was almost inaudible; “I do not know.” He pushed her gently aside, and hurried on. Mercédès fell back on the pavement, and burst into tears. Villefort entered his house, and threw himself into a chair, overcome by emotion. He felt that he had committed a great crime, and that he was a miserable wretch. He thought of Mercédès, of her beauty, of her grief, and he felt a pang of remorse. He had sacrificed an innocent man to his ambition, to his father’s past, and he knew that he should never be happy again. He was no longer a judge, but an executioner. A cold sweat covered his brow, and he felt a profound sense of apprehension, a feeling he had never experienced before. He thought that if Renée or Mercédès had at that moment entered, and said, “Save him!” he would have ordered Dantès to be set at liberty. But no one came, and the valet entered to announce that the carriage was ready.",

                "text": "Villefort hastily quitted the apartment, but reflecting that the sight of the deputy procureur running through the streets would be enough to throw the whole city into confusion, he resumed his ordinary pace. As he reached his own door, a figure emerged from the shadows, a woman, who seemed to have been waiting for him. It was Mercédès. Villefort recognized her instantly, noting her beauty and the dignified, almost severe, expression on her face. He felt as though he were the one being judged as she approached him. \"Monsieur de Villefort,\" she said, her voice trembling slightly, \"I have come to ask you what you have done with Edmond Dantès.\" Villefort felt a cold dread seize him. \"Edmond Dantès?\" he repeated, trying to appear indifferent. \"He is a great criminal, madame, and I can do nothing for him.\" \"A criminal!\" cried Mercédès, tears springing to her eyes. \"You know he is innocent, Monsieur de Villefort! You know he is a good and noble man! Tell me, I implore you, where he is! Is he alive or dead?\" \"I know nothing of his fate, madame,\" said Villefort, his voice hardening. \"He is no longer under my authority.\" He pushed past her gently but firmly and entered his house, closing the door behind him, as if to shut out the image of her despair and the pangs of his own guilt. But remorse followed him in. He entered his salon with a sigh that was almost a sob and sank into a chair, his head in his hands. He felt the first pangs of that torture which he foresaw would be unending. He saw the innocent Dantès, whom he had sacrificed to his ambition and his father's past, standing before him, a perpetual reproach. This remorse was new to him. In all his previous cases, he had condemned the guilty, and his conscience had remained undisturbed. But here, he had condemned an innocent man, and he felt himself not a judge, but an executioner. A profound sense of apprehension, a feeling he had never known before, arose within him. He thought that if Renée or Mercédès herself had at that moment entered and said, \"Save him!\" he might have ordered Dantès's release. But no one came. Instead, his valet entered to announce that his travelling carriage was prepared.",
                "refinement_prompt": "IMPROVEMENT GUIDANCE:\n1. MAJOR STRUCTURAL ISSUES:\n- The completion invents a significant portion of dialogue and interaction between Villefort and Mercédès that does not exist in the original, including a veiled identity, references to Villefort's family, and Mercédès falling to her knees. These invented scenes and exchanges alter the tone and structure of the encounter.\n- The completion omits the original's introspective and metaphorical description of Villefort's remorse, particularly the extended comparison to a wounded hero and the nature of his internal suffering.\n\n2. MISSING ELEMENTS:\n- The completion lacks the original's detailed depiction of Villefort's internal emotional progression after the encounter, including the specific imagery and metaphors used to describe his remorse and psychological torment.\n- The nuanced shift from Villefort's professional detachment to his personal anguish is not fully developed; the completion summarizes his feelings rather than following the original's gradual, layered introspection.\n- The completion does not include the original's reflection on Villefort's past actions as a prosecutor and the contrast between his previous lack of remorse and his current suffering.\n\n3. INACCURATE ELEMENTS:\n- The sequence of events is altered: the completion introduces invented locations and actions (such as a specific street corner and Mercédès veiled in darkness) that are not present in the original.\n- The dialogue is expanded and dramatized beyond what is in the source, including invented lines and emotional outbursts not found in the original passage.\n- The completion attributes certain thoughts and feelings to Villefort in a more direct and explicit manner, rather than following the original's more subtle and metaphorical approach.\n- The ending condenses and simplifies the transition to the valet's entrance, omitting the original's detailed lead-up and emotional context."

You are usually so calm.” “I have been somewhat disturbed by a political affair, which is of importance only to myself, and has no interest for you.” “I do not inquire, father, to penetrate your secrets, but to share your griefs, for I told you, you know, that in future I would have no joy but yours, no sorrow but that which you would experience.” Renée said this with so much tenderness, that Villefort was deeply affected. It was the first time that this young and beautiful girl had ever shown him so much affection, and it was because she loved him that she now suffered. “Thank you, my dear Renée,” said he; “but I assure you that it is nothing.” And he kissed her on the forehead, as he usually did when he wished to conceal his emotion.

He had learned that Dantès had been taken to prison, and he had gone to all his friends, and the influential persons of the city; but the report was already in circulation that Dantès was arrested as a Bonapartist agent; and as the most sanguine looked upon any attempt of Napoleon to remount the throne as impossible, he met with nothing but refusal, and had returned home in despair, declaring that the matter was serious and that nothing more could be done.\nCaderousse was equally restless and uneasy, but instead of seeking, like M. Morrel, to aid Dantès, he had shut himself up with two bottles of black currant brandy, in the hope of drowning reflection. But he did not succeed, and became too intoxicated to fetch any more drink, and yet not so intoxicated as to forget what had happened.

Close to him stood M. de Blacas, who was listening with an air of profound uneasiness to the King’s observations. M. de Blacas was a man of high birth, and of remarkably stiff and formal manners, which were supposed to be indicative of great aristocracy, and was in reality nothing more than the politeness of the courtier. Louis XVIII. was a king of learning and taste, and maintained a correspondence with the celebrated M. Robert de Lamennais, who was then neither an abbé nor an apostate. He was an elegant Latin scholar, and composed Greek verses, which he would occasionally quote with great aplomb in his conversation. He had been compelled to abandon the throne of his ancestors, and to fly from France; and during his exile he had cultivated literature and the arts, and had acquired a taste for them which he retained even after his restoration to power. He was a man of considerable ability, but he was indolent and fond of ease, and was more inclined to trust to the wisdom of his ministers than to his own judgment. He was a great admirer of Horace, and was fond of quoting him. At the moment we are describing, he was engaged in writing a note on the margin of a volume of Horace, and was listening to M. de Blacas with an air of profound uneasiness. “What is the matter, my dear duke?” he inquired, looking up from his book. “You look as if you had seen a vision of kine, and that the seven lean kine had devoured the seven fat kine.

I am troubled by a very different kind of vision, and one which is much more likely to be realized.” “Indeed,” said the King, “and what may that be?” “Sire,” replied M. de Blacas, “I fear that a storm is brewing in the south.” “A storm in the south?” repeated the King, with a smile. “Why, my dear duke, the weather in the south is remarkably fine at this time of the year.

There is no room for a political storm in France.” “Sire,” said M. de Blacas, “I hope that you are right, but I fear that you are mistaken. I have received information from other sources, and I am convinced that there is a political storm brewing in the south.” “Indeed,” said the King, “and what is the nature of this political storm?” “Sire,” replied M. de Blacas, “I fear that it is a storm which will sweep away the throne of your ancestors.” “Indeed,” said the King, with a smile. “And who is to raise this storm?” “Sire,” replied M. de Blacas, “I fear that it is the man who has already once swept away the throne of your ancestors.” “Indeed,” said the King, “and who may that be?” “Sire,” replied M. de Blacas, “it is the man who is now an exile in the island of Elba.” “Indeed,” said the King, “and what is he doing there?” “Sire,” replied M. de Blacas, “he is watching his opportunity.” “Indeed,” said the King, “and what is he waiting for?” “Sire,” replied M. de Blacas, “he is waiting for the moment when he can return to France.” “Indeed,” said the King, “and what will he do when he returns to France?” “Sire,” replied M. de Blacas, “he will sweep away the throne of your ancestors.” “Indeed,” said the King, with a smile. “And how will he do that?” “Sire,” replied M. de Blacas, “he will do it by raising a storm in the south.” “Indeed,” said the King, “and how will he raise this storm?” “Sire,” replied M. de Blacas, “he will do it by means of his adherents, who are very numerous in the south.” “Indeed,” said the King, “and who are these adherents?” “Sire,” replied M. de Blacas, “they are the men who have served under him, and who are still devoted to him.” “Indeed,” said the King, “and what do they propose to do?” “Sire,” replied M. de Blacas, “they propose to raise a rebellion in the south, and to proclaim the man who is now an exile in the island of Elba.” “Indeed,” said the King, “and when do they propose to do this?” “Sire,” replied M. de Blacas, “they propose to do it very shortly.” “Indeed,” said the King, “and what measures have you taken to prevent this?” “Sire,” replied M. de Blacas, “I have taken no measures, for I have no power to do so.

Dandré, announced by the chamberlain-in-waiting, entered.\n“Come in,” said Louis XVIII., with repressed smile, “come in, Baron, and tell the duke all you know—the latest news of M. de Bonaparte; do not conceal anything, however serious,—let us see, the Island of Elba is a volcano, and we may expect to have issuing thence flaming and bristling war—bella, horrida bella.”\nM. Dandré leaned very respectfully on the back of a chair with his two hands, and said:\n“Has your majesty perused yesterday’s report?”\n“Yes, yes; but tell the duke himself, who cannot find anything, what the report contains—give him the particulars of what the usurper is doing in his islet.”\n“Monsieur,” said the baron to the duke, “all the servants of his majesty must approve of the latest intelligence which we have from the Island of Elba. Bonaparte——”\nM. Dandré looked at Louis XVIII., who, employed in writing a note, did not even raise his head. “Bonaparte,” continued the baron, “is mortally wearied, and passes whole days in watching his miners at work at Porto-Longone.”\n“And scratches himself for amusement,” added the king.\n“Scratches himself?” inquired the duke, “what does your majesty mean?”\n“Yes, indeed, my dear duke. Did you forget that this great man, this hero, this demigod, is attacked with a malady of the skin which worries him to death, prurigo?”\n“And, moreover, my dear duke,” continued the minister of police, “we are almost assured that, in a very short time, the usurper will be insane.”\n“Insane?”\n“Raving mad; his head becomes weaker. Sometimes he weeps bitterly, sometimes laughs boisterously, at other time he passes hours on the seashore, flinging stones in the water and when the flint makes ‘duck-and-drake’ five or six times, he appears as delighted as if he had gained another Marengo or Austerlitz. Now, you must agree that these are indubitable symptoms of insanity.”\n“Or of wisdom, my dear baron—or of wisdom,” said Louis XVIII., laughing; “the greatest captains of antiquity amused themselves by casting pebbles into the ocean—see Plutarch’s life of Scipio Africanus.”\nM. de Blacas pondered deeply between the confident monarch and the truthful minister. Villefort, who did not choose to reveal the whole secret, lest another should reap all the benefit of the disclosure, had yet communicated enough to cause him the greatest uneasiness.\n“Well, well, Dandré,” said Louis XVIII., “Blacas is not yet convinced; let us proceed, therefore, to the usurper’s conversion.” The minister of police bowed.\n“The usurper’s conversion!” murmured the duke, looking at the king and Dandré, who spoke alternately, like Virgil’s shepherds. “The usurper converted!”\n“Decidedly, my dear duke.”\n“In what way converted?”\n“To good principles. Tell him all about it, baron.”\n“Why, this is the way of it,” said the minister, with the gravest air in the world: “Napoleon lately had a review, and as two or three of his old veterans expressed a desire to return to France, he gave them their dismissal, and exhorted them to ‘serve the good king.’ These were his own words, of that I am certain.”\n“Well, Blacas, what think you of this?” inquired the king triumphantly, and pausing for a moment from the voluminous scholiast before him.",

Let us see, what is the matter?”“An agent whom I had at Naples, and who has followed Bonaparte to the island of Elba, has just arrived to inform me that the usurper has left Porto-Ferrajo on board a brig named the *Inconstant*, with four hundred men of the Old Guard, two thousand muskets, and a park of artillery.”“Well, well,” said Louis XVIII., “continue.”“The brig was accompanied by two war-brigs, the *Zéphyr* and the *Melpomène*, and a schooner, the *Epervier*.”“Oh, yes, I know all that,” said the king; “and the report states that the vessels were seen on the 28th of February off Cape San-Martin, which is in the Mediterranean.”“Yes, sire, and the report adds that the brig *Inconstant* steered for the Gulf of Juan, and that the schooner *Epervier* and the two war-brigs accompanied her.”“Well, duke,” said the king, smiling, “is that all? You see, I am as well informed as you are.”“No, sire, that is not all,” replied Blacas, with a faltering voice; “the report adds that the brig *Inconstant* anchored in the Gulf of Juan on the 1st of March, and that the men of the Old Guard landed with the usurper.”“Ah, indeed!” said the king, this time with a visible emotion; “where is that report?”“Here it is, sire,” said Blacas, presenting a paper to Louis XVIII.The king took the paper, and read it with attention. When he had finished, he returned it to Blacas. “That is very serious,” said he. “But what do you think of it?”“I think, sire, that the usurper is mad, and that he will be taken before he has gone ten leagues.”“That is also my opinion,” said the king. “He has neither money, nor troops, nor partisans. He is a madman who is going to his ruin.”“So much the better, sire,” said Blacas; “but we must take precautions.”“Of course,” said the king. “Give orders to the minister of war to send troops to the south. Let the garrisons be reinforced. Let the gendarmerie be on the alert. Let the prefects watch over the public mind. Let the police redouble their activity.”“All that has been done, sire,” said Blacas. “But I think we should also send a special commissioner to the south, a man of energy, who can take prompt and decisive measures.”“That is a good idea,” said the king. “Whom do you propose?”“M. de Villefort, sire. He is a young man of great merit, who has already rendered important services to the government.”“M. de Villefort,” said the king. “Yes, I know him. He is the son of the Girondin Noirtier, is he not?”“Yes, sire; but he has entirely renounced the errors of his father. He is a royalist, and a fervent one.”“Very well,” said the king. “Send for M. de Villefort. I will speak to him myself.”Just then, M. Dandré, the minister of police, was announced. “Come in, Dandré,” said the king. “Come and tell the duke the news from the island of Elba. The usurper has left Porto-Ferrajo.”M. Dandré entered, and bowed to the king and the duke. “Has your majesty read the report?” said he.“Yes, yes, Dandré,” said the king; “but tell the duke what you think of it.”“I think, sire,” said Dandré, leaning respectfully on the back of a chair, “that the usurper is lost. He has neither money, nor troops, nor partisans. He is a madman who is going to his ruin.”“That is also my opinion,” said the king. “He is a madman who is going to his ruin.”“So much the better, sire,” said Blacas; “but we must take precautions.”“Of course,” said the king. “Give orders to the minister of war to send troops to the south.

Bonaparte, while at Porto-Ferrajo, is more really a prisoner than if he were in the dungeons of Vincennes.

            "The King detains Blacas, humorously suggesting a new coat of arms for him an eagle with prey, bearing the motto 'Tenax' (Tenacious) due to his persistence. He then tries to engage Blacas in a discussion about a passage in Horace concerning a stag fleeing a wolf.",

            "The King remarks on the arduousness of such a journey when the telegraph could transmit messages much faster and effortlessly.",
            "Blacas passionately advocates for his messenger, emphasizing the ardor and distance traveled to deliver vital information, and beseeches the King to receive him graciously, mentioning M. de Salvieux's recommendation.",

Are you not a sportsman and a great wolf-hunter? Well, then, what do you think of the molli anhelitu?”\n“Admirable, sire; but my messenger is like the stag you refer to, for he has posted two hundred and twenty leagues in scarcely three days.”\n“Which is undergoing great fatigue and anxiety, my dear duke, when we have a telegraph which transmits messages in three or four hours, and that without getting in the least out of breath.”\n“Ah, sire, you recompense but badly this poor young man, who has come so far, and with so much ardor, to give your majesty useful information. If only for the sake of M. de Salvieux, who recommends him to me, I entreat your majesty to receive him graciously.”\n“M. de Salvieux, my brother’s chamberlain?”\n“Yes, sire.”\n“He is at Marseilles.”\n“And writes me thence.”\n“Does he speak to you of this conspiracy?”\n“No; but strongly recommends M. de Villefort, and begs me to present him to your majesty.”\n“M. de Villefort!” cried the king, “is the messenger’s name M. de Villefort?”\n“Yes, sire.”\n“And he comes from Marseilles?”\n“In person.”\n“Why did you not mention his name at once?” replied the king, betraying some uneasiness.\n“Sire, I thought his name was unknown to your majesty.”\n“No, no, Blacas; he is a man of strong and elevated understanding, ambitious, too, and, pardieu! you know his father’s name!”\n“His father?”\n“Yes, Noirtier.”\n“Noirtier the Girondin?—Noirtier the senator?”\n“He himself.”\n“And your majesty has employed the son of such a man?”\n“Blacas, my friend, you have but limited comprehension. I told you Villefort was ambitious, and to attain this ambition Villefort would sacrifice everything, even his father.”\n“Then, sire, may I present him?”\n“This instant, duke! Where is he?”\n“Waiting below, in my carriage.”\n“Seek him at once.”\n“I hasten to do so.”\nThe duke left the royal presence with the speed of a young man; his really sincere royalism made him youthful again. Louis XVIII. remained alone, and turning his eyes on his half-opened Horace, muttered:\n“Justum et tenacem propositi virum.”",

Villefort’s dusty garb, his costume, which was not of courtly cut, excited the susceptibility of M. de Brezé, who was all astonishment at finding that this young man had the audacity to enter before the king in such attire. The duke, however, overcame all difficulties with a word—his majesty’s order; and, in spite of the protestations which the master of ceremonies made for the honor of his office and principles, Villefort was introduced.\nThe king was seated in the same place where the duke had left him. On opening the door, Villefort found himself facing him, and the young magistrate’s first impulse was to pause.\n“Come in, M. de Villefort,” said the king, “come in.”\nVillefort bowed, and advancing a few steps, waited until the king should interrogate him.\n“M. de Villefort,” said Louis XVIII., “the Duc de Blacas assures me you have some interesting information to communicate.”\n“Sire, the duke is right, and I believe your majesty will think it equally important.”\n“In the first place, and before everything else, sir, is the news as bad in your opinion as I am asked to believe?”\n“Sire, I believe it to be most urgent, but I hope, by the speed I have used, that it is not irreparable.”\n“Speak as fully as you please, sir,” said the king, who began to give way to the emotion which had showed itself in Blacas’s face and affected Villefort’s voice. “Speak, sir, and pray begin at the beginning; I like order in everything.”\n“Sire,” said Villefort, “I will render a faithful report to your majesty, but I must entreat your forgiveness if my anxiety leads to some obscurity in my language.” A glance at the king after this discreet and subtle exordium, assured Villefort of the benignity of his august auditor, and he went on:\n“Sire, I have come as rapidly to Paris as possible, to inform your majesty that I have discovered, in the exercise of my duties, not a commonplace and insignificant plot, such as is every day got up in the lower ranks of the people and in the army, but an actual conspiracy—a storm which menaces no less than your majesty’s throne. Sire, the usurper is arming three ships, he meditates some project, which, however mad, is yet, perhaps, terrible. At this moment he will have left Elba, to go whither I know not, but assuredly to attempt a landing either at Naples, or on the coast of Tuscany, or perhaps on the shores of France. Your majesty is well aware that the sovereign of the Island of Elba has maintained his relations with Italy and France?”",

M. de Brezé, the grand master of the ceremonies, was on the point of refusing admittance to M. de Villefort, who had followed the minister, and who was dressed in travelling garb. The grand master of the ceremonies, in all his rigid aristocracy, was as inflexible as the Duc d’Antin had formerly been, at the court of Louis XIV., with regard to the admission of Racine, and stood on the most stringent etiquette. But the king’s order, formally delivered, bade him to make way, and M. de Brezé bowed, in obedience. In a moment Villefort found himself in the presence of Louis XVIII. The king was seated in an arm-chair, with a table before him, on which were laid, it must be understood, not papers of state, but two open volumes, which the king perused with apparent delight, and with his usual smile, a smile which, since 1814, had rarely quitted his lips. Near the king, standing with one hand resting on the back of his chair, was M. de Blacas, who had followed Villefort. At the sight of Villefort, Louis XVIII. closed the two volumes, and, putting a paper-knife in the place, turned towards the young man, saying, “M. de Villefort, M. le Duc de Blacas assures me you have some interesting intelligence to communicate.” “Sire,” replied Villefort, “I think it will be highly interesting, and I therefore hastened to your majesty.” “Speak, monsieur,” said the king, “but first tell me how, with such a dress, you came to enter the Tuileries, which is, I believe, generally closed to travellers and couriers. M. de Brezé is usually so strict.” “Sire, my dress is a proof of the haste with which I have travelled, and of my ardent desire to lay my news before your majesty; and I must beg your majesty to excuse it, and to look only to the importance of the communication which I have to make.” “Do not apologize for your dress, monsieur,” said the king, “but continue your relation. You have travelled, then?” “I have come from Marseilles, sire, with the greatest possible speed.” “A long journey, and in dangerous times,” said the king, smiling, “which you have accomplished, it appears, without accident.” “Sire, I am proud to have incurred danger in your majesty’s service.” “Tell me, besides the fatigue, what dangers have you incurred, monsieur?” “I know not, sire, but I have a commission which I received at the same time as the order to come to Paris.” “From whom?” “From M. le Marquis de Saint-Méran, who desired me to pass his compliments to your majesty, and to say that he is honored to be your majesty’s knight; and that he is making preparations which your majesty will learn at a fitting opportunity.” “A worthy nobleman,” said the king, “a truly worthy nobleman. I am grateful to him for his remembrance.” And he half turned from Villefort to M. de Blacas, adding, “M. de Saint-Méran was almost the only one of his order who remained faithful to us in our exile. He is a most estimable man, and his daughter, whom I saw when she was quite a child, is, I am told, a most beautiful woman.” “Your majesty is correctly informed,” said Villefort, “the marquis’s daughter is a great beauty.” “Ah, then, monsieur,” replied the king, with a most gracious smile, “you are not insensible to the charms of the fair sex, it seems. Let us not detain you from the important communication you have to make to us. Come, come, monsieur, go on, I am listening.” “Sire,” said Villefort, “I have come to inform your majesty of a fact of the utmost importance, which has occurred in the department over which I hold jurisdiction.” “Indeed,” said the king; “what is it?” “A conspiracy, sire, a real conspiracy, which threatens your majesty’s throne.” “A conspiracy,” said Louis XVIII., with a smile, “are you quite sure, monsieur? Conspiracies have become so common nowadays, that they have ceased to alarm us.” “Sire,” said Villefort, “this is not a conspiracy like that of the Rue Saint-Nicaise, or like that of General Malet; this is a plot which may have terrible consequences.” “Indeed,” said the king, his brow contracting; “I am listening, monsieur.” “Here is the information, sire, which I have obtained, and which I have hastened to lay",

            "This sailor, Villefort elaborates, had secretly visited Elba, met with the grand-marshal, and was entrusted with an oral message for a Bonapartist contact in Paris. The purpose of this mission, according to the sailor, was to prepare for Napoleon's imminent return. Villefort confirms the sailor is now imprisoned.",

            "Attempting to project composure, Louis XVIII smiles and opines that while conspiracies are easily conceived in the current era, they are difficult to execute successfully. He emphasizes his government's recent re-establishment and heightened vigilance over the past, present, and future, noting his ministers have redoubled their watch over the Mediterranean shores for ten months.",

He advises Villefort to take courage and assures him of royal gratitude.",

This person, a sailor, of turbulent character, and whom I suspected of Bonapartism, has been secretly to the Island of Elba. There he saw the grand-marshal, who charged him with an oral message to a Bonapartist in Paris, whose name I could not extract from him; but this mission was to prepare men’s minds for a return (it is the man who says this, sire)—a return which will soon occur.”\n“And where is this man?”\n“In prison, sire.”\n“And the matter seems serious to you?”\n“So serious, sire, that when the circumstance surprised me in the midst of a family festival, on the very day of my betrothal, I left my bride and friends, postponing everything, that I might hasten to lay at your majesty’s feet the fears which impressed me, and the assurance of my devotion.”\n“True,” said Louis XVIII., “was there not a marriage engagement between you and Mademoiselle de Saint-Méran?”\n“Daughter of one of your majesty’s most faithful servants.”\n“Yes, yes; but let us talk of this plot, M. de Villefort.”\n“Sire, I fear it is more than a plot; I fear it is a conspiracy.”\n“A conspiracy in these times,” said Louis XVIII., smiling, “is a thing very easy to meditate, but more difficult to conduct to an end, inasmuch as, re-established so recently on the throne of our ancestors, we have our eyes open at once upon the past, the present, and the future. For the last ten months my ministers have redoubled their vigilance, in order to watch the shore of the Mediterranean. If Bonaparte landed at Naples, the whole coalition would be on foot before he could even reach Piombino; if he land in Tuscany, he will be in an unfriendly territory; if he land in France, it must be with a handful of men, and the result of that is easily foretold, execrated as he is by the population. Take courage, sir; but at the same time rely on our royal gratitude.”\n“Ah, here is M. Dandré!” cried de Blacas. At this instant the minister of police appeared at the door, pale, trembling, and as if ready to faint. Villefort was about to retire, but M. de Blacas, taking his hand, restrained him.",

He was surprised when on the point of sailing for Porto-Ferrajo.”\n\n“He is then a Bonapartist?”\n\n“A turbulent sailor, sire, who has been engaged in smuggling for the last twenty years. I interrogated him myself, and in the hope of gaining a pardon he made a full confession. He had been employed by the Bonapartist committee as a messenger to the Isle of Elba.

He seemed to have repeated a lesson given him; and in his alarm he betrayed the secrets with which he was intrusted.”\n\n“This is more serious than you appear to think, sir,” said the king, becoming thoughtful. “Napoleon at the Isle of Elba is more formidable than he was at Paris, because, being at thirty leagues from the coast of Italy, he menaces two kingdoms, while on the other side he is at a hundred and forty leagues from France, and by the Southern provinces, which are the most dangerous ground for us, since it was there that he landed when he returned from Egypt. But did this man say anything else?”\n\n“He said that he believed the expedition would shortly take place.”\n\n“And in what direction?”\n\n“Towards the southern coast.”\n\n“Ah, the madman!” exclaimed the king; “to attack France in the south, when the Vendée is ready to rise in the north!”\n\n“Not in the north, sire, but in the south,” replied Villefort. “The man’s statement was, that he was to land in the south.”\n\n“And what is your opinion, sir?”\n\n“I think, sire, that the expedition is not only projected, but is already in execution; nay, more, I believe it is even now accomplished.”\n\n“Indeed!” said the king, turning pale; “and on what grounds do you base this belief?”\n\n“On this, sire. The man was arrested this morning at six o’clock. He has been four days coming from Porto-Ferrajo, and during these four days there has been a prevalence of north-west wind, which would be favorable to the Bonapartist fleet, and unfavorable to any vessels sent in pursuit.”\n\n“This is serious,” said the king; “very serious.”\n\n“And this is not all, sire. The man said that he was to deliver the verbal message to a Bonapartist in Paris, whose name he was not to mention, but whom he would know by a certain sign.”\n\n“And what was this sign?”\n\n“A ring, sire, with a serpent coiled round it, and the words ‘\n*Nous vous attendons*\n’ (We await you).”\n\n“And have you discovered this man?”\n\n“No, sire; but I hope to do so.”\n\n“And you have left your post to come here?”\n\n“Yes, sire; I considered the matter of so much importance that I thought it my duty to inform your majesty of it in person.”\n\n“You have done well, sir,” said the king; “and I thank you for your zeal.

INACCURATE ELEMENTS:\n- The completion inaccurately describes the suspect's background, inventing a long history of smuggling and a confession motivated by the hope of a pardon.\n- The sequence of events is altered: the timing of the arrest and the delivery of the message are inconsistent with the original.\n- The completion attributes additional dialogue and strategic analysis to the king that does not match the original's focus or tone.\n- The completion introduces a symbolic object (a ring with an inscription) and a code phrase, which are not present in the original passage.\n- The completion misattributes the reason for the speaker's urgency, focusing on the importance of the message rather than the personal sacrifice described in the original.\n- The completion omits the king's reference to the speaker's marriage engagement and the identity of the bride, as well as the speaker's response about her family background.\n- The completion does not maintain the original order of dialogue, especially regarding the discussion of the plot versus conspiracy and the king's reassurance and gratitude."

          "text_segment": "At the sight of this agitation Louis XVIII. pushed from him violently the table at which he was sitting.\n“What ails you, baron?” he exclaimed. “You appear quite aghast. Has your uneasiness anything to do with what M. de Blacas has told me, and M. de Villefort has just confirmed?” M. de Blacas moved suddenly towards the baron, but the fright of the courtier pleaded for the forbearance of the statesman; and besides, as matters were, it was much more to his advantage that the prefect of police should triumph over him than that he should humiliate the prefect.\n“Sire,——” stammered the baron.\n“Well, what is it?” asked Louis XVIII. The minister of police, giving way to an impulse of despair, was about to throw himself at the feet of Louis XVIII., who retreated a step and frowned.\n“Will you speak?” he said.\n“Oh, sire, what a dreadful misfortune! I am, indeed, to be pitied. I can never forgive myself!”\n“Monsieur,” said Louis XVIII., “I command you to speak.”\n“Well, sire, the usurper left Elba on the 26th February, and landed on the 1st of March.”\n“And where? In Italy?” asked the king eagerly.\n“In France, sire,—at a small port, near Antibes, in the Gulf of Juan.”\n“The usurper landed in France, near Antibes, in the Gulf of Juan, two hundred and fifty leagues from Paris, on the 1st of March, and you only acquired this information today, the 3rd of March! Well, sir, what you tell me is impossible. You must have received a false report, or you have gone mad.”\n“Alas, sire, it is but too true!” Louis made a gesture of indescribable anger and alarm, and then drew himself up as if this sudden blow had struck him at the same moment in heart and countenance.\n“In France!” he cried, “the usurper in France! Then they did not watch over this man. Who knows? they were, perhaps, in league with him.”\n“Oh, sire,” exclaimed the Duc de Blacas, “M. Dandré is not a man to be accused of treason! Sire, we have all been blind, and the minister of police has shared the general blindness, that is all.”\n“But——” said Villefort, and then suddenly checking himself, he was silent; then he continued, “Your pardon, sire,” he said, bowing, “my zeal carried me away. Will your majesty deign to excuse me?”\n“Speak, sir, speak boldly,” replied Louis. “You alone forewarned us of the evil; now try and aid us with the remedy.”\n“Sire,” said Villefort, “the usurper is detested in the south; and it seems to me that if he ventured into the south, it would be easy to raise Languedoc and Provence against him.”\n“Yes, assuredly,” replied the minister; “but he is advancing by Gap and Sisteron.”\n“Advancing—he is advancing!” said Louis XVIII. “Is he then advancing on Paris?” The minister of police maintained a silence which was equivalent to a complete avowal.\n“And Dauphiné, sir?” inquired the king, of Villefort. “Do you think it possible to rouse that as well as Provence?”\n“Sire, I am sorry to tell your majesty a cruel fact; but the feeling in Dauphiné is quite the reverse of that in Provence or Languedoc. The mountaineers are Bonapartists, sire.”\n“Then,” murmured Louis, “he was well informed. And how many men had he with him?”\n“I do not know, sire,” answered the minister of police.\n“What, you do not know! Have you neglected to obtain information on that point? Of course it is of no consequence,” he added, with a withering smile.\n“Sire, it was impossible to learn; the despatch simply stated the fact of the landing and the route taken by the usurper.”\n“And how did this despatch reach you?” inquired the king. The minister bowed his head, and while a deep color overspread his cheeks, he stammered out:\n“By the telegraph, sire.” Louis XVIII. advanced a step, and folded his arms over his chest as Napoleon would have done.\n“So then,” he exclaimed, turning pale with anger, “seven conjoined and allied armies overthrew that man. A miracle of heaven replaced me on the throne of my fathers after five-and-twenty years of exile. I have, during those five-and-twenty years, spared no pains to understand the people of France and the interests which were confided to me; and now, when I see the fruition of my wishes almost within reach, the power I hold in my hands bursts and shatters me to atoms!”\n“Sire, it is fatality!” murmured the minister, feeling that the pressure of circumstances, however light a thing to destiny, was too much for any human strength to endure.\n“What our enemies say of us is then true. We have learnt nothing, forgotten nothing! If I were betrayed as he was, I would console myself; but to be in the midst of persons elevated by myself to places of honor, who ought to watch over me more carefully than over themselves,—for my fortune is theirs—before me they were nothing—after me they will be nothing, and perish miserably from incapacity—ineptitude! Oh, yes, sir, you are right—it is fatality!”",

And I?” cried Louis XVIII., rising and pacing the room with hasty strides. “I, who have been restored to the throne of my ancestors by a miracle of Providence, and who have been driven from it by a single man, by a Corsican, by a usurper!”\n“Sire, it is fatality,” said the minister, with a sigh.\n“No, Baron, it is not fatality; it is my own fault. I have been too lenient, too confiding. I ought to have known that the Corsican was a viper, and that I ought to have crushed him when I had him in my power. But I have been too merciful, and I am punished for it.”\n“Sire, it is not yet too late,” said the minister.\n“No, indeed,” said the King, stopping suddenly before a table on which lay a map of France. “He is at Gap, is he not?”\n“Yes, sire.”\n“Well, then, we will send an army to meet him. We will surround him, and we will crush him.”\n“Sire, the troops sent to oppose him have joined him,” repeated the minister.\n“Then we will send others,” cried the King, with a gesture of impatience. “We will send the whole army, if necessary. We will raise the whole nation against him.”\n“Sire, the nation is not with us,” said the minister, in a low voice.\n“What do you say?” cried the King, turning pale. “The nation is not with us? Then who is with us?”\n“Sire, the emigrants, the Vendéans, and the Chouans.”\n“And are they sufficient?” asked the King, with a bitter smile.\n“Sire, they are brave and devoted, but they are not numerous enough to contend against the whole army.”\n“Then we are lost!” cried the King, falling back into his chair.\n“No, sire,” said Villefort, who had remained a silent spectator of this scene, “it is not yet too late.”\n“Ah, M. de Villefort,” said the King, “you are the only one who has foreseen this event, and you are the only one who can save us.”\n“Sire,” said Villefort, “I have already had the honor of telling your Majesty that I had forebodings of this event. I have also had the honor of telling your Majesty that I had discovered a plot which, if it had not been checked, would have led to a similar result.”\n“Yes, yes,” said the King, impatiently, “I remember. But what is to be done now?”\n“Sire,” said Villefort, “it is necessary to act with promptitude and energy. It is necessary to rally around your Majesty all those who are still faithful to you. It is necessary to appeal to the patriotism of the nation.”\n“But the nation is not with us,” said the King.\n“Sire,” said Villefort, “there are still in France many brave and loyal hearts who are ready to shed their blood for your Majesty. There are still in France many who remember the benefits they have received from your Majesty, and who are grateful for them.”\n“You are right, M. de Villefort,” said the King, rising from his chair with renewed hope. “There are still in France many who are faithful to me. We will appeal to them. We will raise the standard of royalty, and we will see who will rally around it.”\n“Sire,” said Villefort, “I am ready to devote my life to your Majesty’s service.

          "text_segment": "The minister quailed before this outburst of sarcasm. M. de Blacas wiped the moisture from his brow. Villefort smiled within himself, for he felt his increased importance.\n“To fall,” continued King Louis, who at the first glance had sounded the abyss on which the monarchy hung suspended,—“to fall, and learn of that fall by telegraph! Oh, I would rather mount the scaffold of my brother, Louis XVI., than thus descend the staircase at the Tuileries driven away by ridicule. Ridicule, sir—why, you know not its power in France, and yet you ought to know it!”\n“Sire, sire,” murmured the minister, “for pity’s——”\n“Approach, M. de Villefort,” resumed the king, addressing the young man, who, motionless and breathless, was listening to a conversation on which depended the destiny of a kingdom. “Approach, and tell monsieur that it is possible to know beforehand all that he has not known.”\n“Sire, it was really impossible to learn secrets which that man concealed from all the world.”\n“Really impossible! Yes—that is a great word, sir. Unfortunately, there are great words, as there are great men; I have measured them. Really impossible for a minister who has an office, agents, spies, and fifteen hundred thousand francs for secret service money, to know what is going on at sixty leagues from the coast of France! Well, then, see, here is a gentleman who had none of these resources at his disposal—a gentleman, only a simple magistrate, who learned more than you with all your police, and who would have saved my crown, if, like you, he had the power of directing a telegraph.” The look of the minister of police was turned with concentrated spite on Villefort, who bent his head in modest triumph.\n“I do not mean that for you, Blacas,” continued Louis XVIII.; “for if you have discovered nothing, at least you have had the good sense to persevere in your suspicions. Any other than yourself would have considered the disclosure of M. de Villefort insignificant, or else dictated by venal ambition.” These words were an allusion to the sentiments which the minister of police had uttered with so much confidence an hour before.\nVillefort understood the king’s intent. Any other person would, perhaps, have been overcome by such an intoxicating draught of praise; but he feared to make for himself a mortal enemy of the police minister, although he saw that Dandré was irrevocably lost. In fact, the minister, who, in the plenitude of his power, had been unable to unearth Napoleon’s secret, might in despair at his own downfall interrogate Dantès and so lay bare the motives of Villefort’s plot. Realizing this, Villefort came to the rescue of the crest-fallen minister, instead of aiding to crush him.\n“Sire,” said Villefort, “the suddenness of this event must prove to your majesty that the issue is in the hands of Providence; what your majesty is pleased to attribute to me as profound perspicacity is simply owing to chance, and I have profited by that chance, like a good and devoted servant—that’s all. Do not attribute to me more than I deserve, sire, that your majesty may never have occasion to recall the first opinion you have been pleased to form of me.” The minister of police thanked the young man by an eloquent look, and Villefort understood that he had succeeded in his design; that is to say, that without forfeiting the gratitude of the king, he had made a friend of one on whom, in case of necessity, he might rely.",

            "Louis XVIII countered that the Rue Saint-Jacques incident seemed intrinsically linked to Napoleon's return, suggesting General Quesnel's death might expose a significant domestic conspiracy.",
            "Villefort visibly trembled when General Quesnel's name was mentioned.",
            "The Minister of Police reported that investigations now pointed to Quesnel's death being an assassination rather than a suicide. He added that Quesnel had recently visited a Bonapartist club before his disappearance and had an appointment with an unknown individual in the Rue Saint-Jacques, though the general's valet only overheard the street name, not the specific number.",
            "While the minister provided these details, Villefort exhibited extreme distress, his complexion alternating between red and pale.",
            "The King, noticing Villefort's reaction, asked if he concurred that General Quesnel, outwardly a Bonapartist sympathizer but secretly loyal to the crown, had been murdered in a Bonapartist trap.",

This individual had been followed the previous day but managed to escape.",
            "Villefort felt a wave of weakness upon hearing the detailed description, but regained some composure upon learning the suspect had eluded capture.",
            "The King instructed the minister to persist in the manhunt, declaring that Quesnel's murderers, regardless of their Bonapartist affiliations, would face severe punishment, as Quesnel would have been a valuable asset.",

Yet, speaking of reports, baron, what have you learned with regard to the affair in the Rue Saint-Jacques?”\n“The affair in the Rue Saint-Jacques!” exclaimed Villefort, unable to repress an exclamation. Then, suddenly pausing, he added, “Your pardon, sire, but my devotion to your majesty has made me forget, not the respect I have, for that is too deeply engraved in my heart, but the rules of etiquette.”\n“Go on, go on, sir,” replied the king; “you have today earned the right to make inquiries here.”\n“Sire,” interposed the minister of police, “I came a moment ago to give your majesty fresh information which I had obtained on this head, when your majesty’s attention was attracted by the terrible event that has occurred in the gulf, and now these facts will cease to interest your majesty.”\n“On the contrary, sir,—on the contrary,” said Louis XVIII., “this affair seems to me to have a decided connection with that which occupies our attention, and the death of General Quesnel will, perhaps, put us on the direct track of a great internal conspiracy.” At the name of General Quesnel, Villefort trembled.\n“Everything points to the conclusion, sire,” said the minister of police, “that death was not the result of suicide, as we first believed, but of assassination. General Quesnel, it appears, had just left a Bonapartist club when he disappeared. An unknown person had been with him that morning, and made an appointment with him in the Rue Saint-Jacques; unfortunately, the general’s valet, who was dressing his hair at the moment when the stranger entered, heard the street mentioned, but did not catch the number.” As the police minister related this to the king, Villefort, who looked as if his very life hung on the speaker’s lips, turned alternately red and pale. The king looked towards him.\n“Do you not think with me, M. de Villefort, that General Quesnel, whom they believed attached to the usurper, but who was really entirely devoted to me, has perished the victim of a Bonapartist ambush?”\n“It is probable, sire,” replied Villefort. “But is this all that is known?”\n“They are on the track of the man who appointed the meeting with him.”\n“On his track?” said Villefort.\n“Yes, the servant has given his description. He is a man of from fifty to fifty-two years of age, dark, with black eyes covered with shaggy eyebrows, and a thick moustache. He was dressed in a blue frock-coat, buttoned up to the chin, and wore at his button-hole the rosette of an officer of the Legion of Honor. Yesterday a person exactly corresponding with this description was followed, but he was lost sight of at the corner of the Rue de la Jussienne and the Rue Coq-Héron.” Villefort leaned on the back of an armchair, for as the minister of police went on speaking he felt his legs bend under him; but when he learned that the unknown had escaped the vigilance of the agent who followed him, he breathed again.\n“Continue to seek for this man, sir,” said the king to the minister of police; “for if, as I am all but convinced, General Quesnel, who would have been so useful to us at this moment, has been murdered, his assassins, Bonapartists or not, shall be cruelly punished.” It required all Villefort’s coolness not to betray the terror with which this declaration of the king inspired him.",

The army is devoted to you.”\n“Do you think so?” said Louis XVIII., with a significant smile. “Enlighten me, M. le Baron, for I left M. de Villefort with the Minister of Police, and M. de Villefort is deeply disturbed about the affair in the Rue Saint-Jacques, to which M. le Baron Dandré alluded, and I should be glad to know the particulars of the report.”\n“The minister was about to lay the report before your majesty when M. de Villefort was announced,” said M. Dandré, “and, with your majesty’s permission, I will now furnish the details.”\n“Speak, Baron, speak,” said the king, turning towards M. Dandré, and at the same time looking at M. de Blacas and M. de Villefort. “Ah, M. de Villefort, so you are the young man who is so deeply disturbed about the police reports, and who discovered, in the garden of the Tuileries, the conspiracy of the Rue Saint-Jacques. By my faith, you do credit to your profession; you should be made prefect of police, or minister at least.”\n“Your majesty is too good to me,” said Villefort, with a smile, “the commendations of my sovereign are a recompense for which I would shed my blood, and as regards the affair in the Rue Saint-Jacques, I can only repeat that it seems to me to be most serious.”\n“Most serious, Villefort?” repeated the king; “these words are too emphatic to be applied to so simple an affair. Baron Dandré, be so good as to give us the report concerning this matter.”\n“This report, sire, is the one I was about to deliver to you when the news of the landing of the Corsican diverted your majesty’s attention. It refers to a conspiracy which has been forming for some time, but which, thanks to the vigilance of the police, has been discovered before it could be put into execution. The head of the conspiracy is a man named Noirtier, who is known to be a Bonapartist, and who has been in communication with the island of Elba. He has been holding meetings in the Rue Saint-Jacques, and it is there that the plan of the conspiracy was arranged.”\n“And what was this plan?” asked the king.\n“To carry off your majesty, and to proclaim the king of Rome,” replied M. Dandré.\n“A bold stroke,” said the king, smiling; “and where were they to carry me?”\n“To the island of Elba, sire,” said M.

But let us return to this conspiracy. You say, M. le Baron, that the head of the conspiracy is a man named Noirtier?”\n“Yes, sire.”\n“And that he is in communication with the island of Elba?”\n“Yes, sire.”\n“And that he has been holding meetings in the Rue Saint-Jacques?”\n“Yes, sire.”\n“And that the plan was to carry me off to the island of Elba?”\n“Yes, sire.”\n“Well, M. le Baron,” said the king, turning towards M. de Blacas, “what do you think of this?”\n“I think, sire, that it is a very serious affair, and that we should take immediate measures to arrest this Noirtier and his accomplices.”\n“That is precisely what I think,” said the king; “and I have already given orders to the police to that effect. But there is another point which disturbs me. M. de Villefort, you spoke of the death of General Quesnel. What do you know about it?”\nVillefort trembled visibly at the mention of this name.\n“Sire,” said he, “I know nothing more than what is contained in the report of the police, which states that the general was found dead in his bed this morning, and that there are suspicions of assassination.”\n“Suspicions of assassination!” exclaimed the king. “And who is suspected?”\n“The report does not name any one, sire, but it appears that the general had been in communication with the conspirators of the Rue Saint-Jacques, and that he was to have taken a prominent part in the execution of the plot.”\n“And you think, then, that he was assassinated by his accomplices, who feared that he might betray them?”\n“That is the most probable conjecture, sire.”\n“And have you any clew to the assassins?”\n“No, sire, but the police are actively engaged in the search.”\n“And what is the description of the man who was to have met General Quesnel in the Rue Saint-Jacques?” asked the king.\n“The general’s valet, who overheard the conversation, could only give the street, not the number, sire.

I will no longer detain you, M. de Villefort, for you must be fatigued after so long a journey; go and rest. Of course you stopped at your father’s?” A feeling of faintness came over Villefort.\n“No, sire,” he replied, “I alighted at the Hotel de Madrid, in the Rue de Tournon.”\n“But you have seen him?”\n“Sire, I went straight to the Duc de Blacas.”\n“But you will see him, then?”\n“I think not, sire.”\n“Ah, I forgot,” said Louis, smiling in a manner which proved that all these questions were not made without a motive; “I forgot you and M. Noirtier are not on the best terms possible, and that is another sacrifice made to the royal cause, and for which you should be recompensed.”\n“Sire, the kindness your majesty deigns to evince towards me is a recompense which so far surpasses my utmost ambition that I have nothing more to ask for.”\n“Never mind, sir, we will not forget you; make your mind easy. In the meanwhile” (the king here detached the cross of the Legion of Honor which he usually wore over his blue coat, near the cross of St. Louis, above the order of Notre-Dame-du-Mont-Carmel and St. Lazare, and gave it to Villefort)—“in the meanwhile take this cross.”\n“Sire,” said Villefort, “your majesty mistakes; this is an officer’s cross.”\n“Ma foi!” said Louis XVIII., “take it, such as it is, for I have not the time to procure you another. Blacas, let it be your care to see that the brevet is made out and sent to M. de Villefort.” Villefort’s eyes were filled with tears of joy and pride; he took the cross and kissed it.\n“And now,” he said, “may I inquire what are the orders with which your majesty deigns to honor me?”\n“Take what rest you require, and remember that if you are not able to serve me here in Paris, you may be of the greatest service to me at Marseilles.”\n“Sire,” replied Villefort, bowing, “in an hour I shall have quitted Paris.”\n“Go, sir,” said the king; “and should I forget you (kings’ memories are short), do not be afraid to bring yourself to my recollection. Baron, send for the minister of war. Blacas, remain.”\n“Ah, sir,” said the minister of police to Villefort, as they left the Tuileries, “you entered by luck’s door—your fortune is made.”\n“Will it be long first?” muttered Villefort, saluting the minister, whose career was ended, and looking about him for a hackney-coach.

He was pale, and his eyes bore traces of fatigue, but his look was firm and resolute. He bowed profoundly to the king, and then stood erect, awaiting his majesty’s commands.“M. de Villefort,” said Louis XVIII., “M. le Ministre de la Police has informed me of your arrival, and of the important mission which you have just accomplished. Speak, and speak freely, as if you were before a council of state.”“Sire,” said Villefort, “I have hastened to Paris to lay before your majesty the result of an inquiry which I have made by the orders of the minister of the interior, and which is of the highest importance to your majesty’s service.”“The minister of the interior is mistaken, M. de Villefort,” said Louis XVIII., smiling; “it is to the minister of police that you should have addressed yourself, as it is he who has given you the order to come to Paris.”“Sire,” said Villefort, “I received my orders from M. le Ministre de l’Intérieur, who desired me to proceed to Paris with the utmost diligence, and to lay before your majesty the information which I had collected.”“Very good, M. de Villefort,” said the king; “proceed.”“Sire, I have discovered not a plot, but a conspiracy, which is on the eve of breaking out.”“A conspiracy!” cried Louis XVIII., starting. “Speak, M. de Villefort, speak quickly.”“Sire, the conspiracy is directed against your majesty’s government; it is headed by the Bonapartists, and its object is to restore the usurper to the throne.”“Indeed!” said the king. “And where are the conspirators?”“Sire, they are at Paris, and I have them in my power.”“In your power! How so?”“I have arrested the chief, and I have in my possession the proofs of his guilt, and the names of his accomplices.”“The chief! Who is he?”“He is a man named Dantès, a sailor, who was the bearer of a letter from the usurper to the Bonapartist committee at Paris.”“And you have arrested him?”“Yes, sire, I have arrested him, and I have the letter.”“Give it to me, M. de Villefort,” said the king.Villefort drew from his pocket a letter, which he presented to the king.Louis XVIII. opened it, and read it with the greatest attention. When he had finished, he said, “This is indeed a serious matter, M. de Villefort. This letter is a proof of the conspiracy, and the names which it contains are those of the principal conspirators.”“Sire,” said Villefort, “I have done my duty, and I am ready to lay down my life for your majesty.”“You are a brave and loyal subject, M. de Villefort,” said the king, “and I shall not forget your services.”Then, turning to the minister of police, he said, “M. le Ministre, you will take the necessary measures to arrest all the persons whose names are contained in this letter.”“Your majesty’s orders shall be executed,” said the minister.Then, turning to Villefort, the king said, “M. de Villefort, you have rendered me a signal service, and I wish to give you a proof of my satisfaction. Have you any request to make?”“Sire,” said Villefort, “I have no request to make. I am happy if I have been able to serve your majesty.”“But I wish to reward you,” said the king. “Ask for anything you please, and it shall be granted.”“Sire,” said Villefort, “I am already sufficiently rewarded by the consciousness of having done my duty.”“That is well said,” replied the king; “but I do not wish to leave you without a more substantial proof of my gratitude.”He paused for a moment, and then, taking from his desk a cross of the Legion of Honor, he said, “M. de Villefort, I create you an officer of the Legion of Honor.”Villefort was deeply moved. He knelt down, and the king passed the ribbon over his head. “You are a worthy son of M. Noirtier,” said the king, “and you do honor to your father.”Villefort started. “Sire,” said he, “my father is a Bonapartist.”“I know it,” said the king; “but that does not prevent you from being a loyal subject. You have proved it by your conduct.”“Sire,” said Villefort,",

MAJOR STRUCTURAL ISSUES:\n- The completion introduces an extended invented conversation between the king and the minister of police that does not exist in the original passage. This includes fabricated discussions about a political assassination, the Band of the South, and the arrest of conspirators, which are not present in the source text.\n- The completion omits the entire sequence of the king’s interaction with Villefort regarding his journey, his father, and the awarding of the cross, which are central to the original passage.\n- The completion invents a scene involving M. de Salvieux and a backstory about Villefort’s actions prior to meeting the king, which is not part of the original.\n\n2. MISSING ELEMENTS:\n- The original’s detailed exchange about Villefort’s travel arrangements, his relationship with his father, and the king’s subtle probing are absent.\n- The emotional response of Villefort, including his feelings of faintness and his reaction to the king’s gift, is missing.\n- The act of the king bestowing the cross and the specific instructions regarding Villefort’s future service are not included.\n- The closing scene, where Villefort leaves the Tuileries, interacts with the minister of police, and departs in a coach while reflecting on his ambitions, is omitted.\n\n3. INACCURATE ELEMENTS:\n- The completion inaccurately attributes lines and actions to characters who do not speak or act in that way in the original, such as the minister of police’s invented dialogue and the king’s responses to it.\n- The sequence of events is altered, with invented events preceding Villefort’s audience with the king, disrupting the original order.\n- The completion introduces incorrect motivations and outcomes, such as the focus on a political assassination and the arrest of a woman for poisoning, which are not part of the original passage’s content or themes."

Noirtier, seating himself, “I might say the same thing to you, when you announce to me your wedding for the 28th of February, and on the 3rd of March you turn up here in Paris.”\n“And if I have come, my dear father,” said Gérard, drawing closer to M. Noirtier, “do not complain, for it is for you that I came, and my journey will be your salvation.”\n“Ah, indeed!” said M.

M. Noirtier then took the trouble to close the door a second time, and to push the bolts.

Villefort was astounded at this excess of precaution, but M. Noirtier returned to him with a smile. “Well, my dear Villefort,” said he, “do you not seem delighted to see me?” “I am, my dear father,” replied Villefort, “but I did not expect you.” “Ah, indeed, I can well believe that, since you announced to me your wedding for the 21st of May, and here you are in Paris on the 3rd of March.” “Do not let us speak of my arrival,” said Villefort, drawing nearer to M. Noirtier, “but of your own.” “I came as quickly as possible,” said Noirtier, “as soon as I received your letter.” “Then you know what is happening?” “I do, and that is the reason of my coming.” “And what do you intend doing?” “I am waiting to hear,” replied Noirtier. “Come, sit down, and let us talk the matter over.” The young man seated himself. “I think,” said Villefort, “that we are alone?” “Perfectly so. But why all these precautions?” “Because I have a most important communication to make to you.” “Relating to what?” “Relating to the king.” “You are a royalist, then?” asked Noirtier, with a smile. “Yes, father, I have been one since the Restoration.” “Not a very long time, then,” said Noirtier. “You were a Bonapartist at the time of my marriage with the noble Demoiselle de Saint-Méran.” “It is true, father,” replied Villefort, blushing, “but, like everyone else, I have followed the tide.” “And you are a royalist of the eve, and I am a royalist of the morrow. The thing is more rare.” “Do not let us jest, father,” said Villefort, “for the time is precious.” “Well, what is this most important communication?” “You have heard of the landing of the Emperor?” “No, indeed, I have not,” replied Noirtier, with the most perfect composure; “but then I must say, I have been engaged since yesterday in an affair of the greatest importance.” “An affair of importance?” asked Villefort. “Yes; I am going to make my will.” “Ah, father!” “Yes, it is time, for I am sixty years old, and at my age one cannot tell what the next day may bring forth. But do not let us deviate from the object of your visit, which, if I am not mistaken, relates to the Emperor?” “Yes, I come to speak to you of this landing.” “Indeed! and where has he landed?” “At Cannes, not far from Antibes.” “Upon my word,” said Noirtier, “that is a bold undertaking. And what is he doing?” “He is marching upon Paris.” “Upon Paris?” said Noirtier. “This is serious. And you come to tell me this?” “Yes; for you can render the greatest service to the king.” “In what way?” “By your influence, which is as great as ever.” “Upon my word,” said Noirtier, “I do not know what you mean. I have no influence.” “Yes, father, you have, and that is why I have come to you. The king and government have been greatly alarmed by this news, and—” “Indeed,” said Noirtier, with a smile, “so the king and government are alarmed? I am glad of that, for they will be more prudent in future.” “Prudent, father! when the Emperor is marching upon Paris?” “Well, that is just the time to be prudent. Let them not be too hasty in their measures.” “Father, the government is taking the most active measures. A general is to be sent to oppose the usurper.” “Ah, indeed! and who is this general?” “General—General Quesnel, who has been sent to the frontier.” “Quesnel?” said Noirtier. “I know him. He is a brave man, but he is a royalist, and the soldiers will not follow him.” “Father, you are mistaken. The soldiers are tired of the Emperor, and",

You, a magistrate, who have sworn to be faithful to the king!”\n\n“A magistrate, who has sworn to be faithful to the king, has also sworn to be faithful to his country,” replied Noirtier; “and when he sees his country on the brink of a precipice, he is bound to save it, if he can.”\n\n“But how can you save it by concealing the presence of the emperor?”\n\n“By concealing it from those who would injure him, and by revealing it to those who would serve him.”\n\n“To whom, then, have you revealed it?”\n\n“To those who are about to join him.”\n\n“You are a conspirator, father,” said Villefort, in a voice of thunder; “you are a conspirator, and you shall be treated as such.”\n\n“As a conspirator, I shall be treated as a conspirator,” replied Noirtier, with a smile; “but as a father, I shall be treated as a father.”\n\n“You are mistaken,” said Villefort; “the law knows no such distinctions. You are a conspirator, and you shall be punished as a conspirator.”\n\n“The law knows no such distinctions,” said Noirtier; “but nature does. You are my son, and you shall not be the instrument of my punishment.”\n\n“I am a magistrate,” said Villefort, “and I shall do my duty.”\n\n“You are a man,” said Noirtier, “and you shall do your duty as a man.”\n\n“What do you mean?”\n\n“I mean that you shall not denounce me.”\n\n“I shall denounce you,” said Villefort; “it is my duty.”\n\n“You shall not denounce me,” said Noirtier; “it is your duty not to denounce me.”\n\n“How so?”\n\n“Because, if you denounce me, you denounce yourself.”\n\n“How so?”\n\n“Because you are my son, and if I am a conspirator, you are the son of a conspirator.”\n\n“That is no reason,” said Villefort; “the law punishes the guilty, not their families.”\n\n“The law punishes the guilty,” said Noirtier; “but the world punishes their families.”\n\n“You are mistaken,” said Villefort; “the world is just.”\n\n“The world is just,” said Noirtier; “but it is also severe. It punishes the guilty, and it punishes their families.”\n\n“You are mistaken,” said Villefort; “the world is just.”",

Why didn’t they search more vigilantly? they would have found——”\n“They have not found; but they are on the track.”\n“Yes, that the usual phrase; I am quite familiar with it. When the police is at fault, it declares that it is on the track; and the government patiently awaits the day when it comes to say, with a sneaking air, that the track is lost.”\n“Yes, but they have found a corpse; the general has been killed, and in all countries they call that a murder.”\n“A murder do you call it? why, there is nothing to prove that the general was murdered. People are found every day in the Seine, having thrown themselves in, or having been drowned from not knowing how to swim.”\n“Father, you know very well that the general was not a man to drown himself in despair, and people do not bathe in the Seine in the month of January. No, no, do not be deceived; this was murder in every sense of the word.”\n“And who thus designated it?”\n“The king himself.”\n“The king! I thought he was philosopher enough to allow that there was no murder in politics. In politics, my dear fellow, you know, as well as I do, there are no men, but ideas—no feelings, but interests; in politics we do not kill a man, we only remove an obstacle, that is all. Would you like to know how matters have progressed? Well, I will tell you. It was thought reliance might be placed in General Quesnel; he was recommended to us from the Island of Elba; one of us went to him, and invited him to the Rue Saint-Jacques, where he would find some friends. He came there, and the plan was unfolded to him for leaving Elba, the projected landing, etc. When he had heard and comprehended all to the fullest extent, he replied that he was a royalist. Then all looked at each other,—he was made to take an oath, and did so, but with such an ill grace that it was really tempting Providence to swear thus, and yet, in spite of that, the general was allowed to depart free—perfectly free. Yet he did not return home. What could that mean? why, my dear fellow, that on leaving us he lost his way, that’s all. A murder? really, Villefort, you surprise me. You, a deputy procureur, to found an accusation on such bad premises! Did I ever say to you, when you were fulfilling your character as a royalist, and cut off the head of one of my party, ‘My son, you have committed a murder?’ No, I said, ‘Very well, sir, you have gained the victory; tomorrow, perchance, it will be our turn.’”\n",

What principles?”“The principles which have led to the murder of General Quesnel.”“My dear Villefort,” said Noirtier, “do not deceive yourself. It was not the principles of the Rue Saint-Jacques club which killed General Quesnel, but the hand of a thief.”“Father, I am sure that I am not mistaken.”“My dear boy,” said Noirtier, looking at his son with a smile, “you are very young, and you have a great deal to learn. The king is mistaken, and you are mistaken. General Quesnel was not assassinated, but he killed himself.”“Killed himself! Why should he kill himself? He was a brave man, and he had no reason to do so.”“He killed himself,” said Noirtier, “because he was a royalist, and he had just left a club of Jacobins.”“But, father, he was not a Jacobin.”“No, but he was a royalist, and he had just left a club of Jacobins. He had heard things which he ought not to have heard, and he had seen things which he ought not to have seen. He had sworn an oath which he ought not to have sworn, and he had broken it.

The elegant salon, so recently a stage for their social triumphs, now felt like a tomb, echoing with the whispers of scandal that had swept through Paris. Fernand Mondego, the once-proud Count de Morcerf, sat slumped in his chair, his face a mask of defeat, the remnants of his military bearing utterly shattered. The public humiliation, the loss of his peerage, the utter ruin of his reputation – it had all happened with breathtaking speed, orchestrated by the man they had welcomed into their home, the enigmatic Count of Monte Cristo.\n\n\"Sweeping?\" Fernand echoed, his voice hoarse,"

You think he is tracked, pursued, captured; he is advancing as rapidly as his own eagles.

The postilion cracked his whip, and the horses started off at a gallop. Villefort looked back at the house, and saw a light in the window of the room where he had left his father. He felt a pang at his heart, and a tear started to his eye. He was leaving his father, perhaps for ever. But he had saved him, and that thought was a consolation. He leaned back in the carriage, and closed his eyes. He was exhausted, both in body and mind. The events of the last few hours had been too much for him. He had saved his father, but he had also compromised himself. He had helped a Bonapartist to escape, and he was a royalist. What would be the consequences? He did not know, but he feared the worst. He resolved to follow his father’s advice, and to be prudent, silent, and inoffensive. He would return to Marseilles, and wait. He would see what the future would bring forth. He had a presentiment that his life was about to undergo a great change. He did not know whether it would be for good or for evil, but he felt that it would be a",

The seeds of destruction sown years ago by the ambitious and the corrupt were now bearing their bitter fruit. Villefort, the seemingly impregnable procureur du roi, found his carefully constructed life crumbling around him. The revelations orchestrated by the mysterious Count of Monte Cristo, each one a perfectly aimed blow, exposed the dark secrets he had buried: the Bonapartist past, the illegitimate child, the poisonings within his own household. The scandal surrounding the sudden deaths, the public disgrace of his father, and the relentless pressure from the unknown avenger drove him to the brink of madness. His wife, Heloise, consumed by her own desperate greed and fear, became a tool of fate, her crimes adding another layer to the family's ruin. The once-proud house of Villefort was collapsing, not from external force, but from the rot within, meticulously uncovered and exploited by the man who had suffered so greatly at their hands. The justice Noirtier foresaw was arriving, swift and devastating, a testament to the inescapable consequences of guilt."

He had also learned that the procureur du roi, M. de Villefort, had been the person who had caused him to be arrested. M. Morrel was a man of courage and resolution, and he determined to make an effort to save the unfortunate young man. He therefore resolved to go and see M. de Villefort, and to intercede for Dantès. As for Villefort, he had not lost his place. The king’s procureur of 1815 was still the king’s procureur in 1830. He had even been promoted, and was now procureur général. His marriage, however, had been deferred. Mademoiselle de Saint-Méran, who was a staunch royalist, had declared that she would never marry a man who had served the usurper. Villefort had therefore been obliged to wait. He had, however, kept his place, and had even been promoted. He was now procureur général, and was considered one of the most promising young men in the magistracy. His marriage with Mademoiselle de Saint-Méran was still deferred, but it was understood that it would take place as",

Morrel’s character, his reputation, and his relationships with both Bonapartists and royalists, which is not present in the original passage. This includes invented details about his fortune, associations, and a possible mayoral appointment.\n- The completion introduces a retrospective summary of Dantès’s arrest and Villefort’s actions, which is not part of the original passage at this point.\n\n2. MISSING ELEMENTS:\n- The completion omits the original’s explanation of how the political shift specifically increased Morrel’s influence and enabled him to advocate for Dantès.\n- The transition regarding Villefort’s postponed marriage and the political calculations surrounding it is missing.\n- The detail about Villefort retaining his position and the conditional nature of his marriage plans, depending on the political situation, is not included.\n- The narrative progression leading to the announcement of M. Morrel’s visit to Villefort is absent.\n\n3. INACCURATE ELEMENTS:\n- The completion inaccurately attributes a stance of neutrality to Morrel, whereas the original describes his position differently.\n- There is an inaccurate emphasis on Morrel’s supposed candidacy for mayor and his title in the National Guard, which are not present in the original.\n- The sequence of events is altered: the completion shifts focus to past events and character summaries instead of following the original’s chronological development from the political change to Morrel’s advocacy, Villefort’s situation, and the lead-up to Morrel’s visit.\n- The completion misattributes actions and motivations, such as Morrel’s supposed ongoing concealment of his sentiments and the community’s response to him, which are not described in the original passage at this point."

The authorities, either through weakness or complicity, seemed powerless to quell the rising tide of Bonapartist fervor. Fear gripped the hearts of those who had openly supported the Bourbons. Houses were marked, businesses boycotted, and personal safety became a luxury. The air was thick with suspicion and animosity. Every gathering, every conversation, carried the risk of denunciation. The brief, fragile peace that had followed the Emperor's exile was shattered, replaced by a volatile atmosphere where old grudges resurfaced with terrifying intensity. It was in this climate of unrest, where political allegiances were matters of life and death, that the fate of many, including a young sailor named Edmond Dantès, hung precariously in the balance, caught between the shifting loyalties of a nation in turmoil. The city, a powder keg of conflicting passions, awaited the spark that would ignite widespread conflict."

But Morrel, disappointed in his expectations of exciting fear, was conscious only of the other’s condescension. Villefort had calculated rightly.\n“No,” said Morrel; “I am not mistaken. I have known him for ten years, the last four of which he was in my service. Do not you recollect, I came about six weeks ago to plead for clemency, as I come today to plead for justice. You received me very coldly. Oh, the royalists were very severe with the Bonapartists in those days.”\n“Monsieur,” returned Villefort, “I was then a royalist, because I believed the Bourbons not only the heirs to the throne, but the chosen of the nation. The miraculous return of Napoleon has conquered me, the legitimate monarch is he who is loved by his people.”\n“That’s right!” cried Morrel. “I like to hear you speak thus, and I augur well for Edmond from it.”\n“Wait a moment,” said Villefort, turning over the leaves of a register; “I have it—a sailor, who was about to marry a young Catalan girl. I recollect now; it was a very serious charge.”\n“How so?”\n“You know that when he left here he was taken to the Palais de Justice.”\n“Well?”\n“I made my report to the authorities at Paris, and a week after he was carried off.”\n“Carried off!” said Morrel. “What can they have done with him?”\n“Oh, he has been taken to Fenestrelles, to Pignerol, or to the Sainte-Marguérite islands. Some fine morning he will return to take command of your vessel.”\n“Come when he will, it shall be kept for him. But how is it he is not already returned? It seems to me the first care of government should be to set at liberty those who have suffered for their adherence to it.”\n“Do not be too hasty, M. Morrel,” replied Villefort. “The order of imprisonment came from high authority, and the order for his liberation must proceed from the same source; and, as Napoleon has scarcely been reinstated a fortnight, the letters have not yet been forwarded.”\n“But,” said Morrel, “is there no way of expediting all these formalities—of releasing him from arrest?”\n“There has been no arrest.”\n“How?”\n“It is sometimes essential to government to cause a man’s disappearance without leaving any traces, so that no written forms or documents may defeat their wishes.”\n“It might be so under the Bourbons, but at present——”\n“It has always been so, my dear Morrel, since the reign of Louis XIV. The emperor is more strict in prison discipline than even Louis himself, and the number of prisoners whose names are not on the register is incalculable.” Had Morrel even any suspicions, so much kindness would have dispelled them.",

He was accused of being a Bonapartist.\" \"Just so,\" said Morrel; \"and you see that the government is relenting, and is about to restore him to me.\" \"Not unlikely,\" said Villefort; \"and yet, as I told you, I have no recollection of the name.\" \"But here is the letter, sir, which I wrote to you on the 2nd of March.\" \"Yes, yes; I see the address. To M. de Villefort, procureur du roi, at the Palais de Justice, Marseilles. But it may be relative to another Dantès than the one in question.\" \"No, sir, I assure you it is the same,\" said Morrel; \"and, besides, be kind enough to refer to the answer you sent me. Here it is.\" Villefort took the letter which Morrel presented to him, and read it, folding it in two, as if to avoid recognizing his own writing. \"It is true,\" said he, \"the date corresponds; and the name, too, is the same. 'Edmond Dantès.'\" \"I knew I was not mistaken,\" said Morrel. \"And now, sir, since you have had the kindness to refresh your memory, and have recollected the circumstance, you will be as indulgent to him as you were to me, will you not?\" \"With all my heart,\" said Villefort. \"As I told you, I was a Royalist then, and the Bourbons were on the throne. They were the natural enemies of the emperor, and those of whom the emperor was the natural enemy. Now, Napoleon is on the throne, and is welcomed by the whole of France, and his enemies are mine. For this reason, as you perceive, I manifest the same feelings towards him as I did formerly towards the Bourbons. I say, then, the emperor is on the throne, and for that reason, and that reason alone, I am a Bonapartist. And of all Bonapartists",

But lose no time; we have lost too much already.”\n“That is true.

It will be remembered that M. Morrel had promised Dantès to employ every means to obtain his liberation. He had, in fact, tried everything. He had used all his influence with the deputies and at the court; but the name of Dantès was in bad odor at the prefecture and the opinion was that he was a most dangerous Bonapartist, and that it would be prudent to keep him in prison. The old merchant was not discouraged. During the Hundred Days, when Napoleon reigned, he renewed his efforts, and thought that now was the time to obtain justice for the unfortunate Dantès. It is true that M. Morrel had not been a Bonapartist, for when the Emperor was at the summit of his power and wished to destroy the English commerce, Morrel, of ancient family and accustomed to foreign trade, had resisted to the utmost, and congratulated himself on his resistance. But in the present instance, the good and worthy man did not make politics a stepping-stone, and the prosperity of Edward was not calculated on the more or less liberal ideas of the government. The only thing the worthy merchant solicited from Napoleon was the liberation of Dantès, and he solicited it warmly. But it was the moment of the most fearful and terrible struggle that ever shook Europe. Napoleon, just returned from the island of Elba, was endeavouring to seize the sceptre he had dropped. He had already depopulated the cities and plundered the provinces, and in the midst of his gigantic projects, carried on with such feverish excitement, he had neither the time nor the thought to devote to the poor ship-boy languishing in the prison of the Château d’If. The war succeeded the return from Elba. The giant was enchained on the rock of St. Helena, and the royal power was restored. Then M. Morrel made a last effort. This was, as we have said, his third attempt. The two former, made, first, six months after the arrest, and the second during the Hundred Days, had been met by a refusal, under the pretext that Dantès was too dangerous a Bonapartist. This time M. Morrel addressed himself to the king’s attorney, M. de Villefort, who, since the restoration, had become a very important personage, and who resided at Toulouse, where he had been appointed king’s attorney, as the air of Marseilles was not sufficiently pure for M. de Villefort, who was a man of very delicate health.

MAJOR STRUCTURAL ISSUES:\n- The completion introduces several invented scenes and reflections that are not present in the original, such as detailed descriptions of Dantès’s ignorance of political changes, the mention of specific characters like the Count de Blacas and M. de Salvieux, and extended commentary on Morrel’s political attitudes and actions. These additions shift the focus and add content not found in the original passage.\n- The completion omits the original’s concise summary of Villefort’s career move and marriage, which is a significant structural omission from the latter part of the passage.\n\n2. MISSING ELEMENTS:\n- The completion does not include the sequence of events regarding Villefort’s relocation, his new position, and his marriage, which are key developments in the original’s closing section.\n- There is a lack of specific mention of the timeline and the consequences for Villefort and Mademoiselle de Saint-Méran, which are present in the original.\n\n3. INACCURATE ELEMENTS:\n- The completion provides inaccurate or invented details about the political context, such as the roles of certain officials and the nature of Morrel’s political involvement, which are not part of the original.\n- The sequence of Morrel’s attempts to help Dantès is expanded and altered, with additional motivations and actions attributed to him that do not align with the original’s more succinct account.\n- The completion misattributes certain actions and perspectives, such as Morrel’s supposed attendance at political events and his feelings about the government, which are not present in the original passage.\n- The order of events is disrupted, with the completion focusing extensively on Dantès’s ignorance and Morrel’s efforts before addressing the restoration and Villefort’s actions, whereas the original presents these elements in a more streamlined and chronological manner."

But when Napoleon returned to Paris, Danglars’ heart failed him, and he lived in constant fear of Dantès’ return on a mission of vengeance. He therefore informed M.

Should Dantès not return, Mercédès might one day be his.\nMercédès was left alone face to face with the vast plain that had never seemed so barren, and the sea that had never seemed so vast. Bathed in tears she wandered about the Catalan village. Sometimes she stood mute and motionless as a statue, looking towards Marseilles, at other times gazing on the sea, and debating as to whether it were not better to cast herself into the abyss of the ocean, and thus end her woes. It was not want of courage that prevented her putting this resolution into execution; but her religious feelings came to her aid and saved her.\nCaderousse was, like Fernand, enrolled in the army, but, being married and eight years older, he was merely sent to the frontier.

Five months after he had been separated from his son, and almost at the hour of his arrest, he breathed his last in Mercédès’ arms. M.

But, as he had not done so, it was evident he had only uttered the threat for effect. The effect produced was such as he desired, for Mercédès, ever kind and compassionate, was much affected. It is true, she had always entertained a sincere regard for Fernand, and this regard had become doubly powerful when she saw the young man present himself, his body braced, his face pale, and his voice broken, before her. She placed his knapsack on his shoulder, and advised him to be prudent, to take care of himself, and, should any misfortune befall him, to remember that she would then be alone in the world. These words were uttered with such an air of melancholy resignation, that Fernand quitted her with his heart filled with a gleam of hope. He had not ceased to love Mercédès, but his love had become tinged with hatred. He bore a deadly grudge against Dantès, and the thought that Dantès might yet be happy with Mercédès was insupportable. Mercédès was left alone, with a desolate landscape before her, and a still more desolate heart within. She wandered about the Catalan village, weeping, sometimes sitting on the rocks, and looking towards Marseilles, sometimes standing on the seashore, and contemplating the vast expanse of the ocean, that seemed to her as boundless, as bare, and as desolate as her own future lot. It was not the courage of a man that was wanting in Mercédès, but the resignation of a woman. She had often thought of ending her sufferings by plunging into the sea, and her religious fears alone restrained her. Caderousse, being a married man, was only drafted into the reserve. He was to remain at the frontier, and guard the coast. Old Dantès, who had never been able to shake off the grief caused by his son’s departure, had been sustained by the hope of his return. But when Napoleon returned to France, and the war broke out again, he felt that he could no longer bear up against his sorrow. He had been declining for some time, and about five months after his son’s arrest, and almost at the very day of the anniversary, he breathed his last in the arms of Mercédès. M. Morrel paid the expenses of his funeral, and settled the few debts which the poor old man had contracted. This was not an act of pure benevolence on the part of M.

It is true, she had always entertained a sincere regard for Fernand, and this regard had become doubly powerful when she saw the young man present himself, his body braced, his face pale, and his voice broken, before her. She placed his knapsack on his shoulder, and advised him to be prudent, to take care of himself, and, should any misfortune befall him, to remember that she would then be alone in the world. These words were uttered with such an air of melancholy resignation, that Fernand quitted her with his heart filled with a gleam of hope. He had not ceased to love Mercédès, but his love had become tinged with hatred. He bore a deadly grudge against Dantès, and the thought that Dantès might yet be happy with Mercédès was insupportable. Mercédès was left alone, with a desolate landscape before her, and a still more desolate heart within. She wandered about the Catalan village, weeping, sometimes sitting on the rocks, and looking towards Marseilles, sometimes standing on the seashore, and contemplating the vast expanse of the ocean, that seemed to her as boundless, as bare, and as desolate as her own future lot. It was not the courage of a man that was wanting in Mercédès, but the resignation of a woman. She had often thought of ending her sufferings by plunging into the sea, and her religious fears alone restrained her. Caderousse, being a married man, was only drafted into the reserve. He was to remain at the frontier, and guard the coast. Old Dantès, who had never been able to shake off the grief caused by his son’s departure, had been sustained by the hope of his return. But when Napoleon returned to France, and the war broke out again, he felt that he could no longer bear up against his sorrow. He had been declining for some time, and about five months after his son’s arrest, and almost at the very day of the anniversary, he breathed his last in the arms of Mercédès. M. Morrel paid the expenses of his funeral, and settled the few debts which the poor old man had contracted. This was not an act of pure benevolence on the part of M. Morrel; it was also an act of courage, for to assist, even in his last moments, the father of a man suspected of Bonapartism, was a crime in the excited state of the public mind in the south of France.",

But Fernand Mondego, the Count of Morcerf, was not a man driven to despair by lost love alone. His was a soul steeped in ambition and pride, a man who valued status and wealth above all else, even the woman he had wronged so grievously. The humiliation of Mercédès's final, damning words stung him deeply, a wound to his ego rather than his heart. He left her, not contemplating death, but seething with impotent rage, his mind still clinging to the vestiges of his power and reputation, however tarnished.\n\nHe returned to his grand house, now a hollow shell echoing with the whispers of scandal that had swept Paris. The news of his exposure as Ali Pasha's betrayer, the source of his ill-gotten fortune, had spread like wildfire. His title was stripped, his seat in the Chamber of Peers revoked, his name a byword for infamy. His son, Albert, had disowned him. His wife had abandoned him. The world he had built on lies and treachery had crumbled entirely, leaving him exposed and ruined.\n\nIt was not the loss of Mercédès that drove him to the brink now, but the utter, irredeemable destruction of his public life, the loss of everything he had ever truly valued: his honour (or the appearance of it), his fortune, his position in society. He paced the deserted halls of his mansion, the silence amplifying the deafening roar of his disgrace. There was no escape, no possibility of rebuilding, no corner of the world where the name 'Mondego' would not be synonymous with betrayal and shame. It was this absolute, public annihilation, this final, inescapable ruin, that finally pushed him to the act he had not contemplated in the face of personal rejection. He raised the pistol, not in sorrow for a lost love, but in a final, desperate flight from the consequences of a lifetime of villainy."

Dantès in his cell heard the noise of preparation,—sounds that at the depth where he lay would have been inaudible to any but the ear of a prisoner, who could hear the splash of the drop of water that every hour fell from the roof of his dungeon. He guessed something uncommon was passing among the living; but he had so long ceased to have any intercourse with the world, that he looked upon himself as dead.\nThe inspector visited, one after another, the cells and dungeons of several of the prisoners, whose good behavior or stupidity recommended them to the clemency of the government. He inquired how they were fed, and if they had any request to make. The universal response was, that the fare was detestable, and that they wanted to be set free.\nThe inspector asked if they had anything else to ask for. They shook their heads. What could they desire beyond their liberty? The inspector turned smilingly to the governor.\n“I do not know what reason government can assign for these useless visits; when you see one prisoner, you see all,—always the same thing,—ill fed and innocent. Are there any others?”\n“Yes; the dangerous and mad prisoners are in the dungeons.”\n“Let us visit them,” said the inspector with an air of fatigue. “We must play the farce to the end. Let us see the dungeons.”\n“Let us first send for two soldiers,” said the governor. “The prisoners sometimes, through mere uneasiness of life, and in order to be sentenced to death, commit acts of useless violence, and you might fall a victim.”\n“Take all needful precautions,” replied the inspector.",

            "prefix-probing": "A year after Louis XVIII.’s restoration, a visit was made by the inspector-general of prisons. His tour included the formidable Château d'If, a fortress perched on a rocky island off the coast of Marseille, notorious for holding political prisoners and those deemed too dangerous for conventional jails. The inspector, a man of stern countenance but perhaps a flicker of humanity in his eyes, was guided through the labyrinthine corridors and damp, subterranean cells. He observed the grim conditions: the perpetual twilight, the cold stone floors, the meager rations, and the profound silence broken only by the distant roar of the sea or the clanking of keys.\n\nHe paused before certain cells, reading the names and sentences of the inmates – some condemned for treason, others for crimes long forgotten by the outside world. The governor, a man hardened by years of overseeing despair, offered curt explanations. The inspector noted the pallor of the prisoners' faces, the vacant stares, the palpable sense of hopelessness that permeated the very stone. He saw men who had entered in the prime of life, now aged and broken, their identities slowly eroding in the crushing solitude.\n\nThis inspection, a mere formality in the grand scheme of state administration, nonetheless brought a brief, fleeting disturbance to the monotonous existence within the fortress walls. For one prisoner, in particular, this period of official scrutiny, however superficial, coincided with a desperate, subterranean effort. Unseen and unheard by the inspector or his retinue, deep within the rock, a persistent scraping and tunneling was underway. This visit, while not directly impacting the prisoner's immediate fate, marked a point in time shortly before the sound of that clandestine labor would finally reach the ears of the man in the adjacent cell, setting in motion a chain of events that would forever alter his destiny. The inspector left, the gates clanged shut, and the Château d'If returned to its silent, oppressive vigil, unaware of the extraordinary connection about to be forged in its depths."

          "text_segment": "This was the inspector’s first visit; he wished to display his authority.\n“Let us visit this one first,” added he.\n“By all means,” replied the governor, and he signed to the turnkey to open the door. At the sound of the key turning in the lock, and the creaking of the hinges, Dantès, who was crouched in a corner of the dungeon, whence he could see the ray of light that came through a narrow iron grating above, raised his head. Seeing a stranger, escorted by two turnkeys holding torches and accompanied by two soldiers, and to whom the governor spoke bareheaded, Dantès, who guessed the truth, and that the moment to address himself to the superior authorities was come, sprang forward with clasped hands.\nThe soldiers interposed their bayonets, for they thought that he was about to attack the inspector, and the latter recoiled two or three steps. Dantès saw that he was looked upon as dangerous. Then, infusing all the humility he possessed into his eyes and voice, he addressed the inspector, and sought to inspire him with pity.\nThe inspector listened attentively; then, turning to the governor, observed, “He will become religious—he is already more gentle; he is afraid, and retreated before the bayonets—madmen are not afraid of anything; I made some curious observations on this at Charenton.” Then, turning to the prisoner, “What is it you want?” said he.\n“I want to know what crime I have committed—to be tried; and if I am guilty, to be shot; if innocent, to be set at liberty.”\n“Are you well fed?” said the inspector.\n“I believe so; I don’t know; it’s of no consequence. What matters really, not only to me, but to officers of justice and the king, is that an innocent man should languish in prison, the victim of an infamous denunciation, to die here cursing his executioners.”\n“You are very humble today,” remarked the governor; “you are not so always; the other day, for instance, when you tried to kill the turnkey.”\n“It is true, sir, and I beg his pardon, for he has always been very good to me, but I was mad.”\n“And you are not so any longer?”\n“No; captivity has subdued me—I have been here so long.”\n“So long?—when were you arrested, then?” asked the inspector.\n“The 28th of February, 1815, at half-past two in the afternoon.”\n“Today is the 30th of July, 1816,—why, it is but seventeen months.”\n“Only seventeen months,” replied Dantès. “Oh, you do not know what is seventeen months in prison!—seventeen ages rather, especially to a man who, like me, had arrived at the summit of his ambition—to a man, who, like me, was on the point of marrying a woman he adored, who saw an honorable career opened before him, and who loses all in an instant—who sees his prospects destroyed, and is ignorant of the fate of his affianced wife, and whether his aged father be still living! Seventeen months’ captivity to a sailor accustomed to the boundless ocean, is a worse punishment than human crime ever merited. Have pity on me, then, and ask for me, not intelligence, but a trial; not pardon, but a verdict—a trial, sir, I ask only for a trial; that, surely, cannot be denied to one who is accused!”\n“We shall see,” said the inspector; then, turning to the governor, “On my word, the poor devil touches me. You must show me the proofs against him.”\n“Certainly; but you will find terrible charges.”\n“Monsieur,” continued Dantès, “I know it is not in your power to release me; but you can plead for me—you can have me tried—and that is all I ask. Let me know my crime, and the reason why I was condemned. Uncertainty is worse than all.”\n“Go on with the lights,” said the inspector.\n“Monsieur,” cried Dantès, “I can tell by your voice you are touched with pity; tell me at least to hope.”\n“I cannot tell you that,” replied the inspector; “I can only promise to examine into your case.”\n“Oh, I am free—then I am saved!”\n“Who arrested you?”\n“M. Villefort. See him, and hear what he says.”\n“M. Villefort is no longer at Marseilles; he is now at Toulouse.”\n“I am no longer surprised at my detention,” murmured Dantès, “since my only protector is removed.”\n“Had M. de Villefort any cause of personal dislike to you?”\n“None; on the contrary, he was very kind to me.”\n“I can, then, rely on the notes he has left concerning you?”\n“Entirely.”\n“That is well; wait patiently, then.”\nDantès fell on his knees, and prayed earnestly. The door closed; but this time a fresh inmate was left with Dantès—Hope.",

He ordered the door to be opened, and, attended by the governor, entered the cell. Dantès was crouched in a corner, observing with an eye of savage wildness the faint ray of light which penetrated the upper part of his cell. He had been so long alone that he had almost forgotten the human voice. He raised himself up and stood before the officials. The inspector was a man of high rank, and consequently of great power; he was severe to the guilty, but possessed of compassion for the unfortunate, and this was the first time he had ever heard of Dantès, or the crime of which he was accused. He advanced a step, and Dantès prostrated himself at his feet. The soldiers, thinking he was about to make an attack, presented their bayonets, and the inspector recoiled a step. The governor smiled. Dantès saw that he was suspected of madness, and resolved to prove his sanity. He infused into his voice and eyes all the humility he was capable of assuming, and said, “Sir, I know not who you are, but you are a man of power, and I implore you to have pity on me.” “What do you want?” asked the inspector. “I want to know what crime I have committed, and to be put on my trial. If I am guilty, let me be punished; if I am innocent, let me be set at liberty.” “You are not well fed, I see,” said the inspector, looking at the coarse bread and water which constituted Dantès’s fare. “That is not what I complain of, sir,” said Dantès; “I am not hungry, but I am dying of despair.” “You are mad,” said the governor. “No, sir, I am not mad,” said Dantès; “I am only unfortunate. I was arrested on the 28th of February, 1815, and I have been in prison ever since. I was about to be married, and I had a promising career before me. I know not what has become of my fiancée, or my father. I have been here seventeen months, and it seems to me seventeen ages.” The inspector was visibly affected. He turned to the governor and said, “This man does not seem to me to be mad; he seems to me to be a victim of some political intrigue.” Then, turning to Dantès, he said, “I will examine your case, and if I find that you are innocent, I will do my best to obtain your release.” “Oh, sir,” cried Dantès, “you have given me hope; you have saved me.” “Do not be too sanguine,” said the inspector; “I can promise you nothing, but I will do my best.” “And who was it that denounced me?” asked Dantès. “M. de Villefort,” said the governor. “M. de Villefort!” exclaimed Dantès; “he is in Toulouse now, is he not?” “Yes,” said the governor. “Then I am not surprised that I am still here,” murmured Dantès. “But,” said the inspector, “I can rely on M. de Villefort’s notes concerning you.” As the door closed, Dantès fell on his knees and prayed.

The first year he offered government a million of francs for his release; the second, two; the third, three; and so on progressively. He is now in his fifth year of captivity; he will ask to speak to you in private, and offer you five millions.”\n“How curious!—what is his name?”\n“The Abbé Faria.”\n“No. 27,” said the inspector.\n“It is here; unlock the door, Antoine.”\nThe turnkey obeyed, and the inspector gazed curiously into the chamber of the mad abbé, as the prisoner was usually called.\nIn the centre of the cell, in a circle traced with a fragment of plaster detached from the wall, sat a man whose tattered garments scarcely covered him. He was drawing in this circle geometrical lines, and seemed as much absorbed in his problem as Archimedes was when the soldier of Marcellus slew him. He did not move at the sound of the door, and continued his calculations until the flash of the torches lighted up with an unwonted glare the sombre walls of his cell; then, raising his head, he perceived with astonishment the number of persons present. He hastily seized the coverlet of his bed, and wrapped it round him.\n“What is it you want?” said the inspector.\n“I, monsieur,” replied the abbé with an air of surprise,—“I want nothing.”\n“You do not understand,” continued the inspector; “I am sent here by government to visit the prison, and hear the requests of the prisoners.”\n“Oh, that is different,” cried the abbé; “and we shall understand each other, I hope.”\n“There, now,” whispered the governor, “it is just as I told you.”\n“Monsieur,” continued the prisoner, “I am the Abbé Faria, born at Rome. I was for twenty years Cardinal Spada’s secretary; I was arrested, why, I know not, toward the beginning of the year 1811; since then I have demanded my liberty from the Italian and French government.”\n“Why from the French government?”\n“Because I was arrested at Piombino, and I presume that, like Milan and Florence, Piombino has become the capital of some French department.”\n“Ah,” said the inspector, “you have not the latest news from Italy?”\n“My information dates from the day on which I was arrested,” returned the Abbé Faria; “and as the emperor had created the kingdom of Rome for his infant son, I presume that he has realized the dream of Machiavelli and Cæsar Borgia, which was to make Italy a united kingdom.”\n“Monsieur,” returned the inspector, “Providence has changed this gigantic plan you advocate so warmly.”\n“It is the only means of rendering Italy strong, happy, and independent.”\n“Very possibly; only I am not come to discuss politics, but to inquire if you have anything to ask or to complain of.”\n“The food is the same as in other prisons,—that is, very bad; the lodging is very unhealthful, but, on the whole, passable for a dungeon; but it is not that which I wish to speak of, but a secret I have to reveal of the greatest importance.”\n“We are coming to the point,” whispered the governor.\n“It is for that reason I am delighted to see you,” continued the abbé, “although you have disturbed me in a most important calculation, which, if it succeeded, would possibly change Newton’s system. Could you allow me a few words in private.”\n“What did I tell you?” said the governor.\n“You knew him,” returned the inspector with a smile.\n“What you ask is impossible, monsieur,” continued he, addressing Faria.\n“But,” said the abbé, “I would speak to you of a large sum, amounting to five millions.”\n“The very sum you named,” whispered the inspector in his turn.",

It was a cell similar in all respects to that of Dantès, and inhabited by the number 27. The governor remarked that this prisoner was very different from the first. “He is a man of great learning,” he said, “and was a distinguished churchman. He is not so much mad as he is eccentric, and, above all, so self-opinionated that there is no managing him.”“What is his particular mania?” asked the inspector.“He pretends to the possession of an immense treasure, and offers vast sums to the government if they will liberate him.”“Ah, indeed! and how long has he been here?”“About four or five years.”“And in that time has he not abated his pretensions?”“Not in the least,” said the governor; “he even increases them. At first he offered a million, then two, and now, although he has not been here more than five years, he has just made a proposition of five millions.”“Ah, this is curious,” said the inspector; “and you say he is not altogether mad?”“No,” returned the governor, “but at the same time he is not thoroughly sane. He has occasional lucid intervals, during which he would embarrass a confessor. I have sometimes tried the power of religion in appealing to him, but he replies with quotations that would make a Jesuit blush. He is more cunning than mad, and, to sound him, you must always pretend to believe his story, and even appear amazed at it.”“I understand,” said the inspector; “let us see him.”The turnkey had opened the door, and the inspector, preceded by the governor, entered. In the centre of the cell, a man with a body more bent than the arch over which they were passing, was drawing with a piece of charcoal, mathematical lines upon the floor. He was so absorbed in his occupation that he did not perceive the entrance of the strangers, and the governor was obliged to touch him on the shoulder. “Good-day, Abbé Faria,” said he; “here is the inspector-general, who has come to visit the prison, and to address a few questions to you.”The man whom they styled Abbé Faria turned instantly, and his eyes, full of intelligence, though marked with deep circles, met the gaze of the inspector. He was a man of long standing, with white hair and beard, and a countenance that would have been fine had not suffering, that second executioner, so altered it. He was clothed in a sort of sack, which left his neck and half of his chest bare. As he felt the cold, he drew this garment closer round him, and stooped to pick up a small fragment of plaster which had detached itself from the wall, and which he had used for his calculations by the aid of a long nail, which he had sharpened, as we have observed, and with which he drew the figures on the floor. With the exception of this, he had no tools, but it was easy to see that the iron bedstead, the bed-linen, and his dress, had all been used at various times for his purposes. He saluted the inspector with much politeness. “I beg your pardon, sir,” said he, “for not perceiving you sooner; but I was tracing a problem which, if solved, might be of great importance to the scientific world.”“Pray do not apologize, it is in our duty to visit you,” replied the inspector. “Have you any request to make?”“A request?” said the abbé; “ah, yes, I understand, you are doubtless the new governor.”“No, sir,” said the inspector, “I am not the governor, but the inspector-general, commissioned to visit all the prisons in the department.”“Ah, then it is to the superior government that I must address myself?”“Doubtless. Have you any request to make?” said the inspector, a second time.“Yes, I have, but I wish to speak to you in private, for it is a matter of the deepest importance.”The governor smiled, and made a sign to the inspector. “You see how it is, sir,” he said, speaking half aloud to him. “This is the man I spoke to you about.”“Nevertheless,” said the inspector, to the abbé, “you can speak before the governor.”“No,” replied the abbé, “that is impossible; I have been four years soliciting an interview of this kind, and I will not lose the opportunity of divulging my secret to a person who is able to make use of it, and obtain justice for me, and it would require too long to enter into the necessary details before a third person.”“Still, you can trust the governor,” said the inspector.“I know the governor very well, sir,” returned the abbé, and for that reason I will not speak before him, but I will speak before you, and that without hesitation.”“You are wrong, Abbé, and I assure you that you can relate anything to the governor that you could tell to me; he is a man of the strictest honor.”“Ah, that is your opinion, sir, and you are perfectly right to have so high an opinion of the worthy governor, but I entertain a different opinion from yours.”The abbé spoke these words with an air of such perfect calmness, and such profound conviction, that the inspector was visibly struck by it. “What you tell me is very extraordinary, my dear Abbé,” he said.“No, it is but the truth,” replied the abbé; “but, to return to my object, will you grant me a private interview?”“I cannot do that; I am forbidden to be left alone with any of the prisoners.”“Then,” said the abbé, “I can tell you nothing, and you will lose the opportunity of doing a great act of justice, and the government will lose five millions of francs, which I offer as a ransom.”",

Have you any request to make?” said the inspector, a second time.“Yes, I have, but I wish to speak to you in private, for it is a matter of the deepest importance.”The governor smiled, and made a sign to the inspector. “You see how it is, sir,” he said, speaking half aloud to him. “This is the man I spoke to you about.”“Nevertheless,” said the inspector, to the abbé, “you can speak before the governor.”“No,” replied the abbé, “that is impossible; I have been four years soliciting an interview of this kind, and I will not lose the opportunity of divulging my secret to a person who is able to make use of it, and obtain justice for me, and it would require too long to enter into the necessary details before a third person.”“Still, you can trust the governor,” said the inspector.“I know the governor very well, sir,” returned the abbé, and for that reason I will not speak before him, but I will speak before you, and that without hesitation.”“You are wrong, Abbé, and I assure you that you can relate anything to the governor that you could tell to me; he is a man of the strictest honor.”“Ah, that is your opinion, sir, and you are perfectly right to have so high an opinion of the worthy governor, but I entertain a different opinion from yours.”The abbé spoke these words with an air of such perfect calmness, and such profound conviction, that the inspector was visibly struck by it. “What you tell me is very extraordinary, my dear Abbé,” he said.“No, it is but the truth,” replied the abbé; “but, to return to my object, will you grant me a private interview?”“I cannot do that; I am forbidden to be left alone with any of the prisoners.”“Then,” said the abbé, “I can tell you nothing, and you will lose the opportunity of doing a great act of justice, and the government will lose five millions of francs, which I offer as a ransom.”",

Had not government better profit by it? I will offer six millions, and I will content myself with the rest, if they will only give me my liberty.”\n“On my word,” said the inspector in a low tone, “had I not been told beforehand that this man was mad, I should believe what he says.”\n“I am not mad,” replied Faria, with that acuteness of hearing peculiar to prisoners. “The treasure I speak of really exists, and I offer to sign an agreement with you, in which I promise to lead you to the spot where you shall dig; and if I deceive you, bring me here again,—I ask no more.”\nThe governor laughed. “Is the spot far from here?”\n“A hundred leagues.”\n“It is not ill-planned,” said the governor. “If all the prisoners took it into their heads to travel a hundred leagues, and their guardians consented to accompany them, they would have a capital chance of escaping.”\n“The scheme is well known,” said the inspector; “and the abbé’s plan has not even the merit of originality.”\nThen turning to Faria, “I inquired if you are well fed?” said he.\n“Swear to me,” replied Faria, “to free me if what I tell you prove true, and I will stay here while you go to the spot.”\n“Are you well fed?” repeated the inspector.\n“Monsieur, you run no risk, for, as I told you, I will stay here; so there is no chance of my escaping.”\n“You do not reply to my question,” replied the inspector impatiently.\n“Nor you to mine,” cried the abbé. “You will not accept my gold; I will keep it for myself. You refuse me my liberty; God will give it me.” And the abbé, casting away his coverlet, resumed his place, and continued his calculations.\n“What is he doing there?” said the inspector.\n“Counting his treasures,” replied the governor.\nFaria replied to this sarcasm with a glance of profound contempt. They went out. The turnkey closed the door behind them.\n“He was wealthy once, perhaps?” said the inspector.\n“Or dreamed he was, and awoke mad.”\n“After all,” said the inspector, “if he had been rich, he would not have been here.”\nSo the matter ended for the Abbé Faria.

The days, weeks, and months rolled on, each mark on the wall a silent witness to his continued existence within the stone tomb. The initial surge of hope brought by the inspector's visit gradually ebbed away, replaced by a crushing sense of hopelessness. The world outside seemed to have forgotten him entirely. He ate, he slept, he existed, but life had lost its savor. The thought of escape, once a burning fire, dwindled to a faint ember. Despair, a cold, heavy shroud, settled upon him. He contemplated ending his suffering, perhaps by refusing food or by dashing his head against the unyielding wall. The idea of suicide became a constant companion, whispering insidious suggestions in his ear. He felt utterly alone, abandoned by God and man. One day, as he lay on his pallet, lost in the depths of his misery, a faint, rhythmic sound reached his ears. It was a dull, scraping noise, seemingly coming from the wall near his head. He listened intently, his heart pounding. Was it rats? No, it was too regular, too deliberate. It sounded like digging. Could it be another prisoner? The possibility, however remote, ignited a spark of life within him. He pressed his ear against the cold stone, straining to hear. The sound continued, a steady, persistent chipping. It was real. He was not alone. This discovery, this faint promise of human connection, pulled him back from the brink of self-destruction. He began to tap on the wall, hoping for a response, a"

He was sustained at first by that pride of conscious innocence which is the sequence to hope; then he began to doubt his own innocence, which justified in some measure the governor’s belief in his mental alienation; and then, relaxing his sentiment of pride, he addressed his supplications, not to God, but to man. God is always the last resource. Unfortunates, who ought to begin with God, do not have any hope in him till they have exhausted all other means of deliverance.\nDantès asked to be removed from his present dungeon into another, even if it were darker and deeper, for a change, however disadvantageous, was still a change, and would afford him some amusement. He entreated to be allowed to walk about, to have fresh air, books, and writing materials. His requests were not granted, but he went on asking all the same. He accustomed himself to speaking to the new jailer, although the latter was, if possible, more taciturn than the old one; but still, to speak to a man, even though mute, was something. Dantès spoke for the sake of hearing his own voice; he had tried to speak when alone, but the sound of his voice terrified him.\nOften, before his captivity, Dantès’ mind had revolted at the idea of assemblages of prisoners, made up of thieves, vagabonds, and murderers. He now wished to be amongst them, in order to see some other face besides that of his jailer; he sighed for the galleys, with the infamous costume, the chain, and the brand on the shoulder. The galley-slaves breathed the fresh air of heaven, and saw each other. They were very happy.\nHe besought the jailer one day to let him have a companion, were it even the mad abbé. The jailer, though rough and hardened by the constant sight of so much suffering, was yet a man. At the bottom of his heart he had often had a feeling of pity for this unhappy young man who suffered so; and he laid the request of number 34 before the governor; but the latter sapiently imagined that Dantès wished to conspire or attempt an escape, and refused his request. Dantès had exhausted all human resources, and he then turned to God.",

In the meantime, the governor came twice to see him, but Dantès was so cold and reserved, and his pride of innocence repelled all the governor’s attempts at kindness, that the latter felt he was not deceived in the political prisoner, and Dantès lay forgotten in his dungeon. Dantès had at first resolved to wait patiently, but when he saw that he was forgotten, he began to despair. With the pride of innocence, he had expected to be speedily set free; but when he found that this was not the case, he felt that he could not long endure this state of uncertainty, which is worse than death. He had not even the resource of the condemned, who, at a certain hour, can say, “To-morrow I shall be free,” meaning, “To-morrow I shall die.” He had not even the hope of the mariner who expects to-morrow’s dawn; or the prisoner in a foreign land, who looks for the arrival of a messenger from his country. Dantès had none of these hopes; he was a prisoner in his own country, in his own city, in his own port. He saw the sea, of which he was so fond, and which had always been to him a friend, separated from him by a wall of stone.

He prayed, and prayed aloud, no longer terrified at the sound of his own voice, for he fell into a sort of ecstasy. He laid every action of his life before the Almighty, proposed tasks to accomplish, and at the end of every prayer introduced the entreaty oftener addressed to man than to God: “Forgive us our trespasses as we forgive them that trespass against us.” Yet in spite of his earnest prayers, Dantès remained a prisoner.\nThen gloom settled heavily upon him. Dantès was a man of great simplicity of thought, and without education; he could not, therefore, in the solitude of his dungeon, traverse in mental vision the history of the ages, bring to life the nations that had perished, and rebuild the ancient cities so vast and stupendous in the light of the imagination, and that pass before the eye glowing with celestial colors in Martin’s Babylonian pictures. He could not do this, he whose past life was so short, whose present so melancholy, and his future so doubtful. Nineteen years of light to reflect upon in eternal darkness! No distraction could come to his aid; his energetic spirit, that would have exalted in thus revisiting the past, was imprisoned like an eagle in a cage. He clung to one idea—that of his happiness, destroyed, without apparent cause, by an unheard-of fatality; he considered and reconsidered this idea, devoured it (so to speak), as the implacable Ugolino devours the skull of Archbishop Roger in the Inferno of Dante.\nRage supplanted religious fervor. Dantès uttered blasphemies that made his jailer recoil with horror, dashed himself furiously against the walls of his prison, wreaked his anger upon everything, and chiefly upon himself, so that the least thing,—a grain of sand, a straw, or a breath of air that annoyed him, led to paroxysms of fury. Then the letter that Villefort had showed to him recurred to his mind, and every line gleamed forth in fiery letters on the wall like the mene, mene, tekel upharsin of Belshazzar. He told himself that it was the enmity of man, and not the vengeance of Heaven, that had thus plunged him into the deepest misery. He consigned his unknown persecutors to the most horrible tortures he could imagine, and found them all insufficient, because after torture came death, and after death, if not repose, at least the boon of unconsciousness.",

He prayed, and prayed aloud, no longer by words alone, but with a fervour he had hitherto been a stranger to. In this prayer he reviewed his whole life, he recounted his misfortunes, and entreated the Almighty to have pity on him, and to grant him an end to his trials. The prayer of a suffering soul is holy in the sight of God. But, although Dantès prayed fervently, he was still a prisoner. An entire day passed thus; Dantès neither ate nor slept. At night the jailer came in. “Come,” said he, “are you going to remain without food and without sleep? Why, you will die.” “So much the better,” said Dantès. “Bah,” said the jailer, shrugging his shoulders, “your death would be no advantage to us, and would procure you no pleasure either. On the contrary, you had better eat what is set before you; for if you die, it will be of hunger, and that is not very agreeable, I assure you.” Dantès did not reply. “Come,” continued the jailer, “take courage, and eat.” Dantès drew a deep sigh, and the jailer went out. The gloom deepened in Dantès’s mind. The most terrible thoughts took possession of him. When the jailer returned in the morning, he found Dantès seated in the same place, with his head resting on the table. He had not been to bed, nor had he extinguished the light. “Come,” said the jailer, “eat this.” “What is it?” asked Dantès, whose voice was hoarse and deep. “Soup, and a piece of excellent meat.” “Thank you,” said Dantès, “give it to some one else.” “Are you still unhappy?” asked the jailer. “I am in despair,” returned Dantès; “do not trouble me.” “You are wrong,” said the jailer; “one should never despair. Eat, on the contrary, and endeavour to forget.” “Forget!” replied Dantès; “how can I forget when I have lost my liberty and the prospect of a happy future?” “Try,” said the jailer. “It is of no use,” said Dantès. The jailer went out, and Dantès remained alone. The day passed as the preceding one. Dantès did not eat. The jailer came in at night. “Why,” said he, “you have not touched your food.” “It is not hunger that makes me suffer,” said Dantès. “What is it, then?” asked the jailer. “It is despair.” “Have you nothing else to complain of?” “No.” “So much the worse,” said the jailer. “If you had a fever, I would give you medicine; if you had a cold, I would give you a cordial; but for despair, there is no remedy.” And he went out, leaving Dantès to his gloomy thoughts. The same thing passed on the third day. The jailer found Dantès still in the same place, but his face was pale, and his features contracted. “Come,” said the jailer, “this cannot last; you will die.” “I wish to die,” said Dantès. “Well, then, eat,” said the jailer; “it is the only way to die quickly when you are determined to do so. If you continue to fast, you will suffer for a long time.” “I will eat, then,” said Dantès. And he ate. But he ate mechanically, and without tasting what he ate. The jailer saw that he was still unhappy, but he did not say anything more. He left him, and Dantès remained alone.

He thought of the tortures that he would inflict upon him if he ever had him in his power, and he smiled at the thought. But the smile was a terrible one, and it showed that his heart was full of hatred and revenge. He thought of the sea, and of the liberty that he had lost.

MAJOR STRUCTURAL ISSUES:\n- The completion introduces an extended invented sequence involving multiple interactions with the jailer, including dialogue and descriptions of Dantès refusing food and expressing a wish to die. This entire section, which includes several days passing, is not present in the original passage and constitutes a significant addition.\n- The completion omits a substantial portion from the original that describes Dantès’s inability to distract himself with historical or imaginative reflection, as well as the metaphorical comparison to an eagle in a cage and the reference to Ugolino from Dante’s Inferno.\n\n2. MISSING ELEMENTS:\n- The completion does not include the original’s detailed exploration of Dantès’s mental limitations and lack of education, which prevents him from finding solace in intellectual pursuits during his imprisonment.\n- The transition from religious fervor to rage, and the specific description of Dantès’s emotional transformation, is missing.\n- The original’s references to the letter shown by Villefort and the symbolic imagery associated with it are absent.\n- The completion omits the description of Dantès’s fixation on the idea of his destroyed happiness and the comparison to a literary figure’s torment.\n- The final section, where Dantès’s anger is directed at his persecutors and the reflection on the insufficiency of imagined punishments, is not present.\n\n3. INACCURATE ELEMENTS:\n- The completion inaccurately presents a sequence of events involving repeated visits from the jailer and Dantès’s refusal to eat, which does not occur in the original.\n- The emotional progression is altered: instead of moving from prayer to despair to rage, the completion focuses on despair and suicidal ideation, omitting the rage and blasphemy described in the original.\n- The completion attributes introspective reasoning and dialogue to Dantès that are not found in the original, changing the nature of his suffering and response to imprisonment.\n- The timeline is inaccurately extended, with references to multiple days and repeated actions, which are not part of the original passage’s structure."

            "prefix-probing": "All the pious ideas that had been so long forgotten, returned; he recollected the prayers his mother had taught him, and discovered a new meaning in every word; for in prosperity prayers seem but a mere medley of words, until misfortune comes and the unhappy sufferer first understands the meaning of the sublime language in which he invokes the pity of heaven! He prayed with fervor, with a sincerity he had never known, pouring out his soul in supplication, begging for strength, for deliverance, for a sign that he was not utterly abandoned. The cold stone of his cell became an altar, the damp air a sanctuary. For a time, this renewed faith was a balm, a fragile shield against the crushing weight of his reality. He clung to it desperately, counting the days by the meager light that filtered through the narrow window, believing that surely, God would not allow such an injustice to stand forever. He waited, patiently at first, then with growing anxiety. Weeks turned into months, months into years. The prayers, once vibrant with hope, became mechanical, then rote, then finally, a bitter mockery on his lips. The silence of the prison, once filled with the echoes of his fervent pleas, became a vast, empty void that swallowed his voice and his hope alike. The initial comfort faded, replaced by a gnawing despair more terrible than any physical pain. He questioned the God he had so recently embraced, seeing only indifference or, worse, active cruelty in the relentless passage of time and the unchanging misery of his existence. Why had he been spared the storm at sea, only to be buried alive in this tomb? Why had he been given a glimpse of happiness, only to have it snatched away so brutally? His faith withered and died, choked by the weeds of bitterness and abandonment. He no longer prayed; he cursed. He no longer hoped; he despaired. The thought of death, once terrifying, became a welcome prospect, the only possible escape from the suffocating darkness. He contemplated ending his own life, his mind a tempest of anguish and rage. He was no longer Edmond Dantes, the hopeful sailor, the loving son, the devoted fiancé. He was merely a number, a forgotten wretch, a shadow in the abyss, stripped of everything, even the solace of belief. The prison had not only confined his body; it had begun to consume his soul, leaving behind only the hollow shell of a man on the brink of utter annihilation."

Unhappy he, who, on the brink of misfortune, broods over ideas like these!\nBefore him is a dead sea that stretches in azure calm before the eye; but he who unwarily ventures within its embrace finds himself struggling with a monster that would drag him down to perdition. Once thus ensnared, unless the protecting hand of God snatch him thence, all is over, and his struggles but tend to hasten his destruction. This state of mental anguish is, however, less terrible than the sufferings that precede or the punishment that possibly will follow. There is a sort of consolation at the contemplation of the yawning abyss, at the bottom of which lie darkness and obscurity.\nEdmond found some solace in these ideas. All his sorrows, all his sufferings, with their train of gloomy spectres, fled from his cell when the angel of death seemed about to enter. Dantès reviewed his past life with composure, and, looking forward with terror to his future existence, chose that middle line that seemed to afford him a refuge.\n“Sometimes,” said he, “in my voyages, when I was a man and commanded other men, I have seen the heavens overcast, the sea rage and foam, the storm arise, and, like a monstrous bird, beating the two horizons with its wings. Then I felt that my vessel was a vain refuge, that trembled and shook before the tempest. Soon the fury of the waves and the sight of the sharp rocks announced the approach of death, and death then terrified me, and I used all my skill and intelligence as a man and a sailor to struggle against the wrath of God. But I did so because I was happy, because I had not courted death, because to be cast upon a bed of rocks and seaweed seemed terrible, because I was unwilling that I, a creature made for the service of God, should serve for food to the gulls and ravens. But now it is different; I have lost all that bound me to life, death smiles and invites me to repose; I die after my own manner, I die exhausted and broken-spirited, as I fall asleep when I have paced three thousand times round my cell,—that is thirty thousand steps, or about ten leagues.”\nNo sooner had this idea taken possession of him than he became more composed, arranged his couch to the best of his power, ate little and slept less, and found existence almost supportable, because he felt that he could throw it off at pleasure, like a worn-out garment. Two methods of self-destruction were at his disposal. He could hang himself with his handkerchief to the window bars, or refuse food and die of starvation. But the first was repugnant to him. Dantès had always entertained the greatest horror of pirates, who are hung up to the yard-arm; he would not die by what seemed an infamous death. He resolved to adopt the second, and began that day to carry out his resolve.\nNearly four years had passed away; at the end of the second he had ceased to mark the lapse of time. Dantès said, “I wish to die,” and had chosen the manner of his death, and fearful of changing his mind, he had taken an oath to die. “When my morning and evening meals are brought,” thought he, “I will cast them out of the window, and they will think that I have eaten them.”",

It was a thought that crept into the darkest corners of his mind, a serpent whispering of release, of an end to the gnawing despair that consumed him day and night. He had tried everything else: raging against the injustice, pleading with his unseen captors, clinging to the faintest flicker of hope that someone, somewhere, remembered him and would come to his aid. But the silence of the Château d'If was absolute, broken only by the rhythmic lapping of the waves against the rock and the cries of the seabirds, sounds that mocked his isolation. Hope had withered and died, leaving behind a barren landscape of suffering. Suicide seemed the only logical conclusion, the ultimate act of defiance against a fate he could not escape. He considered starving himself, but the instinct for survival, however weak, rebelled against the slow agony. He thought of dashing his head against the wall, but the stone was hard, and his strength was failing; he feared he would only succeed in injuring himself, prolonging his misery. The rope from his bedclothes? Too flimsy, too uncertain. Poison? There was none. The sea? Inaccessible. Every avenue of self-destruction seemed blocked, just as every avenue of escape was. He was trapped, not just by stone and iron, but by the very limitations of his prison. Yet, the idea persisted, a morbid fascination. He would lie on his pallet, eyes wide in the darkness, contemplating the void, the sweet oblivion it promised. He imagined the moment of release, the cessation of pain, the final silence. It was a seductive thought, a siren song in the desolate ocean of his despair. He was so close to yielding, so close to letting go of the last vestiges of his will to live. He had already begun to refuse the meager food offered to him, feeling a grim satisfaction in this small act of rebellion, this slow march towards the end. His body weakened, his mind grew hazy, and the world outside his cell seemed to recede into an impossible dream. He was ready to embrace the darkness, to surrender to the inevitable. He felt the cold hand of death reaching for him, and he was almost ready to grasp it. He was sinking, sinking into the abyss, when suddenly, a sound reached him. It was faint, almost imperceptible at first, a dull, rhythmic scraping. It seemed to come from the wall near his head. He paused, his breath catching in his throat. Was it a rat? A guard? Or was it merely a figment of his fevered imagination? He listened intently, straining his ears in the oppressive silence. The sound came again, clearer this time, a distinct *scrape, scrape, scrape*. It was not the scurrying of a rat, nor the heavy tread of a guard. It was something else, something deliberate. A spark, tiny and fragile, ignited in the ashes of his hope. Could it be? Could there be another living soul in this tomb? The thought was electrifying. It pulled him back from the brink, anchoring him to the world of the living with a sudden, fierce urgency. Suicide was forgotten, replaced by a burning curiosity, a desperate need to understand the source of this mysterious sound. He pressed his ear against the cold stone, listening, waiting, his heart pounding with a mixture of fear and exhilaration. The scraping continued, a promise whispered through the stone, a challenge to the silence that had been his only companion for so long. He was no longer alone."

Nothing but the recollection of his oath gave him strength to proceed. Hunger made viands once repugnant, now acceptable; he held the plate in his hand for an hour at a time, and gazed thoughtfully at the morsel of bad meat, of tainted fish, of black and mouldy bread. It was the last yearning for life contending with the resolution of despair; then his dungeon seemed less sombre, his prospects less desperate. He was still young—he was only four or five-and-twenty—he had nearly fifty years to live. What unforseen events might not open his prison door, and restore him to liberty? Then he raised to his lips the repast that, like a voluntary Tantalus, he refused himself; but he thought of his oath, and he would not break it. He persisted until, at last, he had not sufficient strength to rise and cast his supper out of the loophole. The next morning he could not see or hear; the jailer feared he was dangerously ill. Edmond hoped he was dying.\nThus the day passed away. Edmond felt a sort of stupor creeping over him which brought with it a feeling almost of content; the gnawing pain at his stomach had ceased; his thirst had abated; when he closed his eyes he saw myriads of lights dancing before them like the will-o’-the-wisps that play about the marshes. It was the twilight of that mysterious country called Death!\nSuddenly, about nine o’clock in the evening, Edmond heard a hollow sound in the wall against which he was lying.\nSo many loathsome animals inhabited the prison, that their noise did not, in general, awake him; but whether abstinence had quickened his faculties, or whether the noise was really louder than usual, Edmond raised his head and listened. It was a continual scratching, as if made by a huge claw, a powerful tooth, or some iron instrument attacking the stones.\nAlthough weakened, the young man’s brain instantly responded to the idea that haunts all prisoners—liberty! It seemed to him that heaven had at length taken pity on him, and had sent this noise to warn him on the very brink of the abyss. Perhaps one of those beloved ones he had so often thought of was thinking of him, and striving to diminish the distance that separated them.\nNo, no, doubtless he was deceived, and it was but one of those dreams that forerun death!\nEdmond still heard the sound. It lasted nearly three hours; he then heard a noise of something falling, and all was silent.\nSome hours afterwards it began again, nearer and more distinct. Edmond was intensely interested. Suddenly the jailer entered.\nFor a week since he had resolved to die, and during the four days that he had been carrying out his purpose, Edmond had not spoken to the attendant, had not answered him when he inquired what was the matter with him, and turned his face to the wall when he looked too curiously at him; but now the jailer might hear the noise and put an end to it, and so destroy a ray of something like hope that soothed his last moments.\nThe jailer brought him his breakfast. Dantès raised himself up and began to talk about everything; about the bad quality of the food, about the coldness of his dungeon, grumbling and complaining, in order to have an excuse for speaking louder, and wearying the patience of his jailer, who out of kindness of heart had brought broth and white bread for his prisoner.\nFortunately, he fancied that Dantès was delirious; and placing the food on the rickety table, he withdrew. Edmond listened, and the sound became more and more distinct.\n“There can be no doubt about it,” thought he; “it is some prisoner who is striving to obtain his freedom. Oh, if I were only there to help him!”\nSuddenly another idea took possession of his mind, so used to misfortune, that it was scarcely capable of hope—the idea that the noise was made by workmen the governor had ordered to repair the neighboring dungeon.\nIt was easy to ascertain this; but how could he risk the question? It was easy to call his jailer’s attention to the noise, and watch his countenance as he listened; but might he not by this means destroy hopes far more important than the short-lived satisfaction of his own curiosity? Unfortunately, Edmond’s brain was still so feeble that he could not bend his thoughts to anything in particular. He saw but one means of restoring lucidity and clearness to his judgment. He turned his eyes towards the soup which the jailer had brought, rose, staggered towards it, raised the vessel to his lips, and drank off the contents with a feeling of indescribable pleasure.\nHe had the resolution to stop with this. He had often heard that shipwrecked persons had died through having eagerly devoured too much food. Edmond replaced on the table the bread he was about to devour, and returned to his couch—he did not wish to die. He soon felt that his ideas became again collected—he could think, and strengthen his thoughts by reasoning. Then he said to himself:\n“I must put this to the test, but without compromising anybody. If it is a workman, I need but knock against the wall, and he will cease to work, in order to find out who is knocking, and why he does so; but as his occupation is sanctioned by the governor, he will soon resume it. If, on the contrary, it is a prisoner, the noise I make will alarm him, he will cease, and not begin again until he thinks everyone is asleep.”\nEdmond rose again, but this time his legs did not tremble, and his sight was clear; he went to a corner of his dungeon, detached a stone, and with it knocked against the wall where the sound came. He struck thrice.",

The bread was mouldy, the soup was full of maggots, the meat was tainted; but he saw it was not this which revolted him. His stomach was internally revolted at the idea of receiving nourishment. Hunger no longer ravened for food, but rather for death. The fancies he had before indulged in had vanished with the walls of his prison, and he no longer desired liberty, but the grave. How long he had thus remained is unknown even to himself. He had ceased to live in time; he belonged no longer to the past, but to eternity. At length, one evening, when he was lying on the ground, utterly dispirited, suffering from cold and hunger, he heard a singular noise in the wall against which he was leaning. It was a hollow, scraping sound, as if someone were working with a tool on the other side of the stone. The darkness prevented his seeing, but the sound was distinct. Dantès' first idea was that the workmen were making some repairs in the adjoining cell, and he felt a momentary pleasure at the thought that he would have a companion, even if that companion were a convict, for solitary confinement was a far greater punishment than any other. But the noise did not cease. Dantès listened attentively. It seemed to him that the sound came from a distance, and that the wall was thick. He could not distinguish the nature of the tool employed, but it was certainly not a mason's trowel. It was more like a pickaxe or a crowbar. Dantès' heart began to beat. Hope, that had so long been extinguished, rekindled in his breast. Was it possible that he was not alone? Was it possible that there was another prisoner in the adjoining cell? Was it possible that this prisoner was attempting to escape? Dantès rose and pressed his ear against the wall. The sound was still there, but it was fainter. He listened for a long time, but the sound did not return. He lay down again, and the next morning, when the jailer brought him his breakfast, he was so weak that he could scarcely rise. He took the bread and the water, but he could not eat. He lay down again, and the whole day he remained in the same state. In the evening, the jailer came again, and Dantès, who had not spoken for several days, began to talk to him. He complained of the cold, of the damp, of the bad food. The jailer listened patiently, and when Dantès had finished, he said: \"You are not well, my friend. You must eat something.\" \"I cannot eat,\" said Dantès. \"I have no appetite.\" \"You must make an effort,\" said the jailer. \"If you do not eat, you will die.\" \"I would rather die,\" said Dantès. \"I am tired of living.\" The jailer shook his head and went away. Dantès remained alone. He was still weak, but his mind was clearer. He thought of the sound he had heard the night before. Was it a dream? Was it a hallucination? He rose and went to the wall. He pressed his ear against it. He listened attentively. After a few minutes, he heard the sound again. It was still faint, but it was distinct. It was the sound of a tool working on the stone. Dantès' heart leaped for joy. It was not a dream. It was not a hallucination. There was someone in the adjoining cell. There was someone who was attempting to escape. Dantès felt a thrill of hope.

            "prefix-probing": "He kept his word; twice a day he cast out, through the barred aperture, the provisions his jailer brought him—at first gayly, then with deliberation, and at last with regret. The first day, hunger was a novelty, a defiant act against his tormentors. He felt a grim satisfaction in refusing their meager charity, in asserting the last vestige of control over his own fate. But the second day brought a gnawing emptiness, a weakness that began to creep into his limbs. The bread and water, once symbols of his captivity, now appeared as tantalizing, forbidden fruits. He hesitated, his hand trembling as he pushed the tray away, the pangs in his stomach sharper than any physical blow. By the third day, regret had fully blossomed into a desperate craving. His head swam, his vision blurred, and the cold stone floor seemed to mock his futile resistance. He lay huddled in a corner, shivering, his body consuming itself. The image of food haunted his waking thoughts and tormented his fevered dreams. He saw banquets, simple loaves of bread, even the scraps he had once disdained. The defiance was gone, replaced by a profound, animalistic need. He no longer thought of vengeance, of justice, of Mercédès; his world had shrunk to the single, agonizing sensation of hunger. He was no longer Edmond Dantès, the hopeful sailor, the wronged prisoner; he was merely a starving creature in a cage. Despair, a cold, heavy shroud, settled upon him. He had defied them, yes, but at what cost? He was dying, slowly and miserably, in the darkness of his cell. The thought of suicide, which had flickered at the edges of his consciousness before, now took root and grew. He considered dashing his head against the wall, of swallowing his tongue, of simply ceasing to breathe. But even these desperate measures seemed beyond his strength. He was too weak to live, and perhaps too weak to die. Days bled into nights, marked only by the arrival of the jailer, whose footsteps sounded like the approach of doom. Each time, the tray was pushed through the opening, and each time, after a terrible internal struggle, Dantès forced himself to push it back. He was punishing himself, punishing his captors, punishing the world that had so cruelly betrayed him. But the primary victim of this self-inflicted torture was himself. His body wasted away, his eyes sank into their sockets, and his voice became a hoarse whisper. He felt his life ebbing, like a tide receding from a desolate shore. He was alone, utterly alone, in the heart of the fortress, forgotten by God and man. He no longer counted the days, the weeks, the months. Time had ceased to have meaning. He existed in a perpetual twilight of suffering, his mind drifting in and out of lucidity. He thought of his father, dead of grief and starvation. He thought of Mercédès, perhaps married to Fernand, living a life he could only dream of. He thought of Villefort, of Danglars, of Caderousse, the architects of his ruin, living in freedom and prosperity. The injustice of it all was a bitter poison in his soul. He wished for death, prayed for it, begged for it. He lay on the floor, his face pressed against the cold stone, tears long since dried, his body a mere skeleton covered in skin. He was at the very brink of oblivion, ready to surrender to the darkness. It was in this state of utter prostration, of complete abandonment of hope, that he heard it. A faint, rhythmic scraping sound. It was almost imperceptible at first, easily mistaken for the scuttling of rats or the wind whistling through the fortress walls. But it persisted, a steady, deliberate sound coming from somewhere deep within the stone. Dantès, roused from his stupor by this unexpected intrusion, listened intently. His heart, sluggish from starvation, began to beat a little faster. What was it? Was it another prisoner? Was it a workman? Was it merely a figment of his fevered imagination? He dragged himself closer to the wall from which the sound seemed to emanate, pressing his ear against the cold stone. The scraping was clearer here, a definite sound of metal against rock. It was coming from below, or perhaps from the side. A spark, tiny and fragile, ignited in the vast emptiness of his despair. Hope. The most dangerous, the most cruel of all emotions in a place like this. He tried to suppress it, to extinguish it before it could take hold and inflict further pain. But it clung to him, a stubborn ember in the ashes of his soul. He spent hours listening, trying to determine the direction and nature of the sound. It was slow, painstaking work, suggesting a single individual, perhaps using a makeshift tool. Could it be someone trying to escape? The thought was electrifying. If someone else was trying to escape, perhaps he could join them. Perhaps there was a way out after all. He began to tap on the wall, tentatively at first, then with more urgency. He waited, his breath held tight in his chest. Silence. Had they heard him? Were they afraid to respond? He tapped again, a simple rhythm, hoping it would be understood as a signal. Still silence. Disappointment washed over him, cold and sharp. Perhaps it was nothing. Perhaps the sound had stopped. He was about to give up, to sink back into his despair, when"

          "text_segment": "At the first blow the sound ceased, as if by magic.\nEdmond listened intently; an hour passed, two hours passed, and no sound was heard from the wall—all was silent there.\nFull of hope, Edmond swallowed a few mouthfuls of bread and water, and, thanks to the vigor of his constitution, found himself well-nigh recovered.\nThe day passed away in utter silence—night came without recurrence of the noise.\n“It is a prisoner,” said Edmond joyfully. His brain was on fire, and life and energy returned.\nThe night passed in perfect silence. Edmond did not close his eyes.\nIn the morning the jailer brought him fresh provisions—he had already devoured those of the previous day; he ate these listening anxiously for the sound, walking round and round his cell, shaking the iron bars of the loophole, restoring vigor and agility to his limbs by exercise, and so preparing himself for his future destiny. At intervals he listened to learn if the noise had not begun again, and grew impatient at the prudence of the prisoner, who did not guess he had been disturbed by a captive as anxious for liberty as himself.\nThree days passed—seventy-two long tedious hours which he counted off by minutes!\nAt length one evening, as the jailer was visiting him for the last time that night, Dantès, with his ear for the hundredth time at the wall, fancied he heard an almost imperceptible movement among the stones. He moved away, walked up and down his cell to collect his thoughts, and then went back and listened.\nThe matter was no longer doubtful. Something was at work on the other side of the wall; the prisoner had discovered the danger, and had substituted a lever for a chisel.\nEncouraged by this discovery, Edmond determined to assist the indefatigable laborer. He began by moving his bed, and looked around for anything with which he could pierce the wall, penetrate the moist cement, and displace a stone.\nHe saw nothing, he had no knife or sharp instrument, the window grating was of iron, but he had too often assured himself of its solidity. All his furniture consisted of a bed, a chair, a table, a pail, and a jug. The bed had iron clamps, but they were screwed to the wood, and it would have required a screw-driver to take them off. The table and chair had nothing, the pail had once possessed a handle, but that had been removed.\nDantès had but one resource, which was to break the jug, and with one of the sharp fragments attack the wall. He let the jug fall on the floor, and it broke in pieces.\nDantès concealed two or three of the sharpest fragments in his bed, leaving the rest on the floor. The breaking of his jug was too natural an accident to excite suspicion. Edmond had all the night to work in, but in the darkness he could not do much, and he soon felt that he was working against something very hard; he pushed back his bed, and waited for day.\nAll night he heard the subterranean workman, who continued to mine his way. Day came, the jailer entered. Dantès told him that the jug had fallen from his hands while he was drinking, and the jailer went grumblingly to fetch another, without giving himself the trouble to remove the fragments of the broken one. He returned speedily, advised the prisoner to be more careful, and departed.\nDantès heard joyfully the key grate in the lock; he listened until the sound of steps died away, and then, hastily displacing his bed, saw by the faint light that penetrated into his cell, that he had labored uselessly the previous evening in attacking the stone instead of removing the plaster that surrounded it.\nThe damp had rendered it friable, and Dantès was able to break it off—in small morsels, it is true, but at the end of half an hour he had scraped off a handful; a mathematician might have calculated that in two years, supposing that the rock was not encountered, a passage twenty feet long and two feet broad, might be formed.\nThe prisoner reproached himself with not having thus employed the hours he had passed in vain hopes, prayer, and despondency. During the six years that he had been imprisoned, what might he not have accomplished?\nThis idea imparted new energy, and in three days he had succeeded, with the utmost precaution, in removing the cement, and exposing the stone-work. The wall was built of rough stones, among which, to give strength to the structure, blocks of hewn stone were at intervals imbedded. It was one of these he had uncovered, and which he must remove from its socket.\nDantès strove to do this with his nails, but they were too weak. The fragments of the jug broke, and after an hour of useless toil, Dantès paused with anguish on his brow.\nWas he to be thus stopped at the beginning, and was he to wait inactive until his fellow workman had completed his task? Suddenly an idea occurred to him—he smiled, and the perspiration dried on his forehead.\nThe jailer always brought Dantès’ soup in an iron saucepan; this saucepan contained soup for both prisoners, for Dantès had noticed that it was either quite full, or half empty, according as the turnkey gave it to him or to his companion first.\nThe handle of this saucepan was of iron; Dantès would have given ten years of his life in exchange for it.\nThe jailer was accustomed to pour the contents of the saucepan into Dantès’ plate, and Dantès, after eating his soup with a wooden spoon, washed the plate, which thus served for every day. Now when evening came Dantès put his plate on the ground near the door; the jailer, as he entered, stepped on it and broke it.\nThis time he could not blame Dantès. He was wrong to leave it there, but the jailer was wrong not to have looked before him. The jailer, therefore, only grumbled. Then he looked about for something to pour the soup into; Dantès’ entire dinner service consisted of one plate—there was no alternative.\n“Leave the saucepan,” said Dantès; “you can take it away when you bring me my breakfast.”\nThis advice was to the jailer’s taste, as it spared him the necessity of making another trip. He left the saucepan.\nDantès was beside himself with joy. He rapidly devoured his food, and after waiting an hour, lest the jailer should change his mind and return, he removed his bed, took the handle of the saucepan, inserted the point between the hewn stone and rough stones of the wall, and employed it as a lever. A slight oscillation showed Dantès that all went well. At the end of an hour the stone was extricated from the wall, leaving a cavity a foot and a half in diameter.\nDantès carefully collected the plaster, carried it into the corner of his cell, and covered it with earth. Then, wishing to make the best use of his time while he had the means of labor, he continued to work without ceasing. At the dawn of day he replaced the stone, pushed his bed against the wall, and lay down. The breakfast consisted of a piece of bread; the jailer entered and placed the bread on the table.\n“Well, don’t you intend to bring me another plate?” said Dantès.\n“No,” replied the turnkey; “you destroy everything. First you break your jug, then you make me break your plate; if all the prisoners followed your example, the government would be ruined. I shall leave you the saucepan, and pour your soup into that. So for the future I hope you will not be so destructive.”\nDantès raised his eyes to heaven and clasped his hands beneath the coverlet. He felt more gratitude for the possession of this piece of iron than he had ever felt for anything. He had noticed, however, that the prisoner on the other side had ceased to labor; no matter, this was a greater reason for proceeding—if his neighbor would not come to him, he would go to his neighbor. All day he toiled on untiringly, and by the evening he had succeeded in extracting ten handfuls of plaster and fragments of stone. When the hour for his jailer’s visit arrived, Dantès straightened the handle of the saucepan as well as he could, and placed it in its accustomed place. The turnkey poured his ration of soup into it, together with the fish—for thrice a week the prisoners were deprived of meat. This would have been a method of reckoning time, had not Dantès long ceased to do so. Having poured out the soup, the turnkey retired.\nDantès wished to ascertain whether his neighbor had really ceased to work. He listened—all was silent, as it had been for the last three days. Dantès sighed; it was evident that his neighbor distrusted him. However, he toiled on all the night without being discouraged; but after two or three hours he encountered an obstacle. The iron made no impression, but met with a smooth surface; Dantès touched it, and found that it was a beam. This beam crossed, or rather blocked up, the hole Dantès had made; it was necessary, therefore, to dig above or under it. The unhappy young man had not thought of this.\n“Oh, my God, my God!” murmured he, “I have so earnestly prayed to you, that I hoped my prayers had been heard. After having deprived me of my liberty, after having deprived me of death, after having recalled me to existence, my God, have pity on me, and do not let me die in despair!”\n“Who talks of God and despair at the same time?” said a voice that seemed to come from beneath the earth, and, deadened by the distance, sounded hollow and sepulchral in the young man’s ears.

              "simple_agent_extraction": "At the first blow the sound ceased, as if by magic. Dantès waited an hour, two hours, in profound silence; then, notwithstanding the attraction of the unknown, notwithstanding the hunger that gnawed his stomach, he remembered that it was dinner-time, and the jailer would soon come. He ate the bread and drank the water, but could not take his eyes from the wall where the noise had ceased. An hour after, the jailer came, removed the vessels, and went away, without having perceived anything. Dantès listened if the sound would recommence, but all was silent. He passed the day in deep anxiety, the night in feverish imagination; neither in the one nor the other did he close his eyes, or taste repose. The next day, the next night, passed in the same way; and during these forty-eight hours he did not for a moment lose the idea that some one was near him, and that that someone, having ceased to work, was listening to him. Sometimes, in the middle of the night, he started up at the least sound, and eagerly applied the wall, in the hope that his neighbor, having finished or given up his own work, had commenced working for their common safety; but it was all in vain, and when the third day arrived he hung his head and sighed. Faria had listened also, and fancied he heard the sound of tools. But Faria was mistaken; the noise Dantès heard was not made by tools. About ten o'clock in the morning, while the jailer was giving Dantès his dinner, he struck against the wall. Dantès fancied he heard a slight sound in response to the blow. He listened attentively, and was not mistaken. This time the sound was distinct. \"There is someone,\" he said; \"I will speak to him.\" He waited till the jailer was gone, and then, applying his mouth to the holes in the wall, he said, in a low voice, \"Are you there?\" There was no answer. He repeated the question. The same silence. \"Oh, my God!\" he said, \"I am deceived.\" He remained motionless, listening with all the power of his senses. Three hours passed, and then a slight scraping sound was heard against the wall, in the same place that the first had been heard. \"This time it is for real,\" thought Dantès; \"they are answering me.\" He redoubled his attention, and soon distinguished that the noise was caused by a lever working on the stone. \"It is a prisoner,\" he said, \"who is trying to escape. Oh, if I could only help him!\" He listened again. The sound ceased. \"He has heard me,\" thought Dantès, \"and is afraid of being discovered.\" He remained silent for a quarter of an hour, and then, applying his mouth to the wall, he said, \"Do not be afraid; I am a prisoner like yourself. Do you want anything? Can I help you?\" He waited, but there was no answer. \"He is afraid,\" thought Dantès, \"or he does not understand me.\" He remained silent again, and then, after a long pause, he heard the sound again, but this time it was different. It was a dull, heavy sound, as if someone was striking the wall with a hammer. \"He is trying to break through,\" thought Dantès. \"Oh, if I could only help him!\" He listened again, and the sound ceased. He waited, and then, after a long pause, he heard the sound again, but this time it was different.

          "text_segment": "“Ah,” said he, “I hear a human voice.” Edmond had not heard anyone speak save his jailer for four or five years; and a jailer is no man to a prisoner—he is a living door, a barrier of flesh and blood adding strength to restraints of oak and iron.\n“In the name of Heaven,” cried Dantès, “speak again, though the sound of your voice terrifies me. Who are you?”\n“Who are you?” said the voice.\n“An unhappy prisoner,” replied Dantès, who made no hesitation in answering.\n“Of what country?”\n“A Frenchman.”\n“Your name?”\n“Edmond Dantès.”\n“Your profession?”\n“A sailor.”\n“How long have you been here?”\n“Since the 28th of February, 1815.”\n“Your crime?”\n“I am innocent.”\n“But of what are you accused?”\n“Of having conspired to aid the emperor’s return.”\n“What! For the emperor’s return?—the emperor is no longer on the throne, then?”\n“He abdicated at Fontainebleau in 1814, and was sent to the Island of Elba. But how long have you been here that you are ignorant of all this?”\n“Since 1811.”\nDantès shuddered; this man had been four years longer than himself in prison.\n“Do not dig any more,” said the voice; “only tell me how high up is your excavation?”\n“On a level with the floor.”\n“How is it concealed?”\n“Behind my bed.”\n“Has your bed been moved since you have been a prisoner?”\n“No.”\n“What does your chamber open on?”\n“A corridor.”\n“And the corridor?”\n“On a court.”\n“Alas!” murmured the voice.\n“Oh, what is the matter?” cried Dantès.\n“I have made a mistake owing to an error in my plans. I took the wrong angle, and have come out fifteen feet from where I intended. I took the wall you are mining for the outer wall of the fortress.”\n“But then you would be close to the sea?”\n“That is what I hoped.”\n“And supposing you had succeeded?”\n“I should have thrown myself into the sea, gained one of the islands near here—the Isle de Daume or the Isle de Tiboulen—and then I should have been safe.”\n“Could you have swum so far?”\n“Heaven would have given me strength; but now all is lost.”\n“All?”\n“Yes; stop up your excavation carefully, do not work any more, and wait until you hear from me.”\n“Tell me, at least, who you are?”\n“I am—I am No. 27.”\n“You mistrust me, then,” said Dantès. Edmond fancied he heard a bitter laugh resounding from the depths.\n“Oh, I am a Christian,” cried Dantès, guessing instinctively that this man meant to abandon him. “I swear to you by him who died for us that naught shall induce me to breathe one syllable to my jailers; but I conjure you do not abandon me. If you do, I swear to you, for I have got to the end of my strength, that I will dash my brains out against the wall, and you will have my death to reproach yourself with.”\n“How old are you? Your voice is that of a young man.”\n“I do not know my age, for I have not counted the years I have been here. All I do know is, that I was just nineteen when I was arrested, the 28th of February, 1815.”\n“Not quite twenty-six!” murmured the voice; “at that age he cannot be a traitor.”\n“Oh, no, no,” cried Dantès. “I swear to you again, rather than betray you, I would allow myself to be hacked in pieces!”\n“You have done well to speak to me, and ask for my assistance, for I was about to form another plan, and leave you; but your age reassures me. I will not forget you. Wait.”\n“How long?”\n“I must calculate our chances; I will give you the signal.”\n“But you will not leave me; you will come to me, or you will let me come to you. We will escape, and if we cannot escape we will talk; you of those whom you love, and I of those whom I love. You must love somebody?”\n“No, I am alone in the world.”\n“Then you will love me. If you are young, I will be your comrade; if you are old, I will be your son. I have a father who is seventy if he yet lives; I only love him and a young girl called Mercédès. My father has not yet forgotten me, I am sure, but God alone knows if she loves me still; I shall love you as I loved my father.”\n“It is well,” returned the voice; “tomorrow.”\nThese few words were uttered with an accent that left no doubt of his sincerity; Dantès rose, dispersed the fragments with the same precaution as before, and pushed his bed back against the wall. He then gave himself up to his happiness. He would no longer be alone. He was, perhaps, about to regain his liberty; at the worst, he would have a companion, and captivity that is shared is but half captivity. Plaints made in common are almost prayers, and prayers where two or three are gathered together invoke the mercy of heaven.\nAll day Dantès walked up and down his cell. He sat down occasionally on his bed, pressing his hand on his heart. At the slightest noise he bounded towards the door. Once or twice the thought crossed his mind that he might be separated from this unknown, whom he loved already; and then his mind was made up—when the jailer moved his bed and stooped to examine the opening, he would kill him with his water jug. He would be condemned to die, but he was about to die of grief and despair when this miraculous noise recalled him to life.\nThe jailer came in the evening. Dantès was on his bed. It seemed to him that thus he better guarded the unfinished opening. Doubtless there was a strange expression in his eyes, for the jailer said, “Come, are you going mad again?”\nDantès did not answer; he feared that the emotion of his voice would betray him. The jailer went away shaking his head. Night came; Dantès hoped that his neighbor would profit by the silence to address him, but he was mistaken. The next morning, however, just as he removed his bed from the wall, he heard three knocks; he threw himself on his knees.\n“Is it you?” said he; “I am here.”\n“Is your jailer gone?”\n“Yes,” said Dantès; “he will not return until the evening; so that we have twelve hours before us.”\n“I can work, then?” said the voice.\n“Oh, yes, yes; this instant, I entreat you.”\nIn a moment that part of the floor on which Dantès was resting his two hands, as he knelt with his head in the opening, suddenly gave way; he drew back smartly, while a mass of stones and earth disappeared in a hole that opened beneath the aperture he himself had formed. Then from the bottom of this passage, the depth of which it was impossible to measure, he saw appear, first the head, then the shoulders, and lastly the body of a man, who sprang lightly into his cell.",

              "simple_agent_extraction": "“Ah,” said he, “I hear a human voice.”\nIt was indeed a human voice, and the first that Dantès had heard for four years. And in the isolation in which he lived, and had lived for four years, a human voice was a sound that caused him to start and tremble, so accustomed was he to only the silent墙壁 and the noiseless steps of his jailer. Dantès’ first idea was that the voice came from the sentry who was pacing the corridor, and that he spoke to his comrade. He then called as loud as he could, “Hello! hello! who is there?”\n“Who are you?” answered the voice.\n“An unhappy prisoner,” replied Dantès, who instinctively felt that the voice belonged to a fellow-sufferer.\n“Of what country?”\n“A Frenchman.”\n“Your name?”\n“Edmond Dantès.”\n“Your profession?”\n“A sailor.”\n“How long have you been here?”\n“Since the 28th of February, 1815.”\n“Your crime?”\n“I am innocent.”\n“But of what are you accused?”\n“Of having conspired to aid the return of Napoleon.”\n“Napoleon is returned, then?” asked the voice, in a tone of intense excitement.\n“He is more than returned—he is at Paris,” replied Dantès, “in the Tuileries, with the titles of emperor and king.”\n“Indeed?” said the voice, “it is impossible!”\n“It is true, nevertheless; and it is now a hundred days since he has been reigning, so you may imagine he is firmly established.”\n“He reigns in the Tuileries, then, and has been there for a hundred days?”\n“Yes,” repeated Dantès, a little surprised at the prisoner’s want of information, “yes; and you do not seem to know it.”\n“I have been here since 1811,” said the voice.\nDantès shuddered; this man had been a prisoner longer than himself. “No matter,” said he; “do not despair. If Napoleon is put out of the way, another will take his place; and so it will be with the Bourbons and Napoleon. Nothing is eternal in this world, neither are the Bourbons eternal, who have been replaced by Napoleon, nor Napoleon, who has replaced the Bourbons. But who are you?”\n“I am,” said the voice, “Number 27.”\n“You do not give me your name, then?”\n“The names of prisoners are useless; and are only of consequence when they make their escape.”\n“Well, then, if you are not inclined to give me your name, tell me at least what you did to be arrested.”\n“I was a political prisoner.”\n“Then how is it that you have not been set at liberty since the return of Napoleon?”\n“I was waiting for that event. There was to have been an investigation, and I was to have been liberated.”\n“Then why are you not liberated?”\n“I do not know. They have forgotten me, or perhaps something has happened.”\n“What could have happened? The emperor is on the throne.”\n“I told you I have been here since 1811; and as I am here, I cannot tell what has happened.”\n“What! have you not tried to communicate with anybody?”\n“In the first place, I was removed from the fortress of Fenestrelle to the Château d’If, and since then I have been in this dungeon.”\n“Ah, your dungeon, then, is near mine?”\n“Yes, it is only separated by a wall.”\n“And that wall—is it thick?”\n“Oh, yes, very thick.”\n“But have you not tried to break through it?”\n“No, for I should have been discovered and removed to another place, and I should never have found my way back again. I have been waiting for a favorable opportunity.”\n“And you have not found one?”\n“No; but I hope to find one soon.”\n“How so?”\n“I am making a tunnel.”\n“A tunnel! In the earth?”\n“Yes, in the earth.”\n“And where are you going?”\n“To the outer wall of the fortress, and then I shall dig under the ditch, and then I shall be free.”\n“Oh, my friend, my friend, how I envy you!”\n“Do not envy me until I am free. I have been working for four years, and I have not yet reached the outer wall.”\n“Four years!” cried Dantès, in astonishment.\n“Yes, four years; and I have only advanced about six feet.”\n“Only six feet in four years! Why, you will be an old man before you are free.”\n“I am an old man already,” said the voice.\n“And how did you get the tools?”\n“I made them myself.”\n“You made them yourself! But how?”\n“With a piece of iron that I found in my dungeon.”\n“And what is your occupation?”\n“I am a priest.”\n“A priest! Then you are not a soldier?”\n“No, I am a priest.”\n“And you are a political prisoner?”\n“Yes, I am a political prisoner.”\n“But how can a priest be a political prisoner?”\n“I was arrested for having preached against the government.”\n“Ah, indeed!

                "text": "“Ah,” said he, “I hear a human voice.”\nIt was indeed a human voice, and the first that Dantès had heard for four years. And in the isolation in which he lived, and had lived for four years, a human voice was a sound that caused him to start and tremble, so accustomed was he to only the silent墙壁 and the noiseless steps of his jailer. Dantès’ first idea was that the voice came from the sentry who was pacing the corridor, and that he spoke to his comrade. He then called as loud as he could, “Hello! hello! who is there?”\n“Who are you?” answered the voice.\n“An unhappy prisoner,” replied Dantès, who instinctively felt that the voice belonged to a fellow-sufferer.\n“Of what country?”\n“A Frenchman.”\n“Your name?”\n“Edmond Dantès.”\n“Your profession?”\n“A sailor.”\n“How long have you been here?”\n“Since the 28th of February, 1815.”\n“Your crime?”\n“I am innocent.”\n“But of what are you accused?”\n“Of having conspired to aid the return of Napoleon.”\n“Napoleon is returned, then?” asked the voice, in a tone of intense excitement.\n“He is more than returned—he is at Paris,” replied Dantès, “in the Tuileries, with the titles of emperor and king.”\n“Indeed?” said the voice, “it is impossible!”\n“It is true, nevertheless; and it is now a hundred days since he has been reigning, so you may imagine he is firmly established.”\n“He reigns in the Tuileries, then, and has been there for a hundred days?”\n“Yes,” repeated Dantès, a little surprised at the prisoner’s want of information, “yes; and you do not seem to know it.”\n“I have been here since 1811,” said the voice.\nDantès shuddered; this man had been a prisoner longer than himself. “No matter,” said he; “do not despair. If Napoleon is put out of the way, another will take his place; and so it will be with the Bourbons and Napoleon. Nothing is eternal in this world, neither are the Bourbons eternal, who have been replaced by Napoleon, nor Napoleon, who has replaced the Bourbons.

He had a deep-set, penetrating eye, almost buried beneath the thick gray eyebrow, and a long (and still black) beard reaching down to his breast. His thin face, deeply furrowed by care, and the bold outline of his strongly marked features, betokened a man more accustomed to exercise his mental faculties than his physical strength. Large drops of perspiration were now standing on his brow, while the garments that hung about him were so ragged that one could only guess at the pattern upon which they had originally been fashioned.\nThe stranger might have numbered sixty or sixty-five years; but a certain briskness and appearance of vigor in his movements made it probable that he was aged more from captivity than the course of time. He received the enthusiastic greeting of his young acquaintance with evident pleasure, as though his chilled affections were rekindled and invigorated by his contact with one so warm and ardent. He thanked him with grateful cordiality for his kindly welcome, although he must at that moment have been suffering bitterly to find another dungeon where he had fondly reckoned on discovering a means of regaining his liberty.\n“Let us first see,” said he, “whether it is possible to remove the traces of my entrance here—our future tranquillity depends upon our jailers being entirely ignorant of it.”\nAdvancing to the opening, he stooped and raised the stone easily in spite of its weight; then, fitting it into its place, he said:\n“You removed this stone very carelessly; but I suppose you had no tools to aid you.”\n“Why,” exclaimed Dantès, with astonishment, “do you possess any?”\n“I made myself some; and with the exception of a file, I have all that are necessary,—a chisel, pincers, and lever.”\n“Oh, how I should like to see these products of your industry and patience.”\n“Well, in the first place, here is my chisel.”\nSo saying, he displayed a sharp strong blade, with a handle made of beechwood.\n“And with what did you contrive to make that?” inquired Dantès.\n“With one of the clamps of my bedstead; and this very tool has sufficed me to hollow out the road by which I came hither, a distance of about fifty feet.”\n“Fifty feet!” responded Dantès, almost terrified.",

I expected, as I told you, to reach the outer wall, pierce through it, and throw myself into the sea; I have, however, kept along the corridor on which your chamber opens, instead of going beneath it. My labor is all in vain, for I find that the corridor looks into a courtyard filled with soldiers.”\n“That’s true,” said Dantès; “but the corridor you speak of only bounds one side of my cell; there are three others—do you know anything of their situation?”\n“This one is built against the solid rock, and it would take ten experienced miners, duly furnished with the requisite tools, as many years to perforate it. This adjoins the lower part of the governor’s apartments, and were we to work our way through, we should only get into some lock-up cellars, where we must necessarily be recaptured. The fourth and last side of your cell faces on—faces on—stop a minute, now where does it face?”\nThe wall of which he spoke was the one in which was fixed the loophole by which light was admitted to the chamber. This loophole, which gradually diminished in size as it approached the outside, to an opening through which a child could not have passed, was, for better security, furnished with three iron bars, so as to quiet all apprehensions even in the mind of the most suspicious jailer as to the possibility of a prisoner’s escape.

To do so would have required a miner’s pickaxe and a powder-cart, and we have neither the one nor the other.”\n“The other side of your cell, then, is the side of the outer wall?”\n“Oh, no, not the outer wall, but the wall of the next cell to mine. I made a mistake, as I told you, and have come out at fifty feet from the point where I wished to penetrate.”\n“But there is still hope,” said Dantès.\n“Do you think so?” asked the old man.\n“Certainly, since you have followed the right direction.”\n“An error of fifty feet in a straight line, or a miscalculation of the angle, is quite enough to destroy a whole existence, my young friend. It is, as I told you, the angle of the bastion, and not the exterior wall,” said the prisoner.\n“But then, you can continue the work.”\n“Oh, no, it would be necessary to dig under the sentinels, and consequently I should be discovered. Besides, I told you, I have no tools.”\n“But the wall of your cell which faces mine?”\n“That,” said the Abbé, “is one of the four walls of my cell, from which I commenced my operations.”\n“There are thus only three walls left you?”\n“Yes, that facing the window—that by which you entered—and the one that forms the angle of the bastion.”\n“The one facing the window might lead to the sea?”\n“Possibly, if it were not for the thickness of the wall, which, as I told you, is nine feet.”\n“I think,” said Dantès, “that with a lever we might succeed in removing some of the stones.”\n“You think so?” said the Abbé.\n“We could try, at least. But the wall by which I entered?”\n“That forms a right angle with the one from which I came, and leads into the corridor, doubtless, if it does not lead into a courtyard.”\n“But the third wall, that which forms the angle of the bastion?”\n“That, I told you, is the one I reached, and which has foiled all my efforts.”\n“There is, then, but one hope left,” said Dantès, “that is, to pierce the wall of the cell facing the window. Is it not so?”\n“It is the only one,” said the Abbé, “but it is a work of years.”\n“Let us begin it, then,” said Dantès, eagerly.\n“But how can we begin?”\n“I think,” replied Dantès, “that in the first place we must remove the table which is there.”\n“Yes,” said the Abbé.\n“And then,” continued Dantès, “we must get upon the table, and from thence we can reach the window.”\n“Yes,” said the Abbé.\n“And then,” said Dantès, “we must examine the wall.”\n“Yes,” said the Abbé.\n“And then,” said Dantès, “we must see if we can remove any of the stones.”\n“Yes,” said the Abbé.\n“And then,” said Dantès, “we must see if we can make a hole.”\n“Yes,” said the Abbé.\n“And then,” said Dantès, “we must see if we can get out.”\n“Yes,” said the Abbé.\n“And then,” said Dantès, “we must see if we can escape.”\n“Yes,” said the Abbé.\n“And then,” said Dantès, “we must see if we can be free.”\n“Yes,” said the Abbé.\n“And then,” said Dantès, “we must see if we can be happy.”\n“Yes,” said the Abbé.\n“And then,” said Dantès, “we must see if we can be rich.”\n“Yes,” said the Abbé.\n“And then,” said Dantès, “we must see if we can be revenged.”\n“Yes,” said the Abbé.\n“Let us begin, then,” said Dantès.\nThey removed the table, and Dantès mounted upon it.

Ah, my friend!” said the abbé, turning towards Dantès, and surveying him with the kindling gaze of a prophet, “you are young, you will see all this come to pass.”\n“Probably, if ever I get out of prison!”\n“True,” replied Faria, “we are prisoners; but I forget this sometimes, and there are even moments when my mental vision transports me beyond these walls, and I fancy myself at liberty.”\n“But wherefore are you here?”\n“Because in 1807 I dreamed of the very plan Napoleon tried to realize in 1811; because, like Machiavelli, I desired to alter the political face of Italy, and instead of allowing it to be split up into a quantity of petty principalities, each held by some weak or tyrannical ruler, I sought to form one large, compact, and powerful empire; and, lastly, because I fancied I had found my Cæsar Borgia in a crowned simpleton, who feigned to enter into my views only to betray me.

After the Restoration, the English, weary of a republic, hailed the return of the Stuarts; but the Stuarts, by faithless conduct and false promises, soon tired them of royalty, and at the expiration of twenty years a new revolution placed the glorious William of Orange and his wife Mary on the throne. This is somewhat similar to our own history. We had a republic, then the empire, the Restoration, and now we are perhaps about to have a monarchy limited by a charter.”\n\n“And do you think that will happen?” asked Dantès.\n\n“We are young enough to see it. Oh, if I were in a position to follow up my studies, I should complete my work on the possibility of a general coalition of Europe against England, and the part she is destined to play in the future.”\n\n“You spoke of England and the Stuarts,” replied Dantès, “and yet you seem to doubt if you will ever leave prison.”\n\n“Doubt is a word I do not understand,” said Faria. “I have had so many cruel disappointments, that I am now reconciled to them. My mind has been so long accustomed to the intellectual world, that I hardly look upon the real world as existing. I have been so long used to dwelling in thoughts, that they have become phantoms, and I people my cell with them and have conversations, which restore my strength and render life supportable. Then,” continued he, “when my mind is fatigued, I close my eyes and fancy I am again in Rome, among my friends the cardinals, or in Naples, in the midst of those gay and brilliant lords and ladies who used to welcome me with smiles.”\n\n“And how long have you been here?” asked Dantès.\n\n“Since 1807.”\n\n“Eighteen hundred and seven?” repeated Dantès. “Why, that is ten years ago.”\n\n“Yes; ten years I have been striving to forget the past in considering the future.”\n\n“But in 1807 what crime did you commit to be imprisoned?”\n\n“The crime I committed was that of having dreamed of the same thing as Alexander had contemplated before me, as Pius VII. had contemplated before me, as Machiavelli had contemplated before me—a united Italy, and of having sought to realize that dream.”\n\n“A united Italy?” repeated Dantès, who, zealous patriot as he was, understood nothing of the politics of which Faria spoke. “And in what way could you seek to realize this dream?”\n\n“By a very simple means—by a conspiracy to bring together the petty principalities, which form the mosaic work of Italy, into one great kingdom; and, further, to interest Napoleon in the success of this conspiracy.”\n\n“A conspiracy!” said Dantès, whose ideas ran on the conspiracies of the Château d’If, and who had become acquainted with that word only in its bad sense. “And how did you enter into this conspiracy?”\n\n“I was the soul of it. Every one acknowledged me as chief. The work was progressing. When Napoleon started for Tilsit, I had hopes of obtaining an audience; but whether the emperor was persuaded that it would be impossible to effect the union, or whether, like Cæsar, he mistrusted every one, he gave orders that I should be arrested. I was at Fenestrelle, and have been here since then.”\n\n“And have you never tried to escape?”\n\n“No; for I have never despaired of being set at liberty. They cannot have forgotten me. The Pope, the cardinals, King Joachim, have all interceded for me.”\n\n“And have they succeeded?” asked Dantès.\n\n“No; for Napoleon was afraid of me, and when Napoleon has fears, he never relents,” said Faria. “However, since the Restoration they have ceased to persecute me, and content themselves with letting me die quietly in my prison.”\n\n“But why did not the Pope, or King Joachim, or the cardinals, get you set at liberty after the Restoration?” asked Dantès.\n\n“Because,”",

                "text": "“Yes, yes,” continued he, “’Twill be the same as it was in England. After the Restoration, the English, weary of a republic, hailed the return of the Stuarts; but the Stuarts, by faithless conduct and false promises, soon tired them of royalty, and at the expiration of twenty years a new revolution placed the glorious William of Orange and his wife Mary on the throne. This is somewhat similar to our own history. We had a republic, then the empire, the Restoration, and now we are perhaps about to have a monarchy limited by a charter.”\n\n“And do you think that will happen?” asked Dantès.\n\n“We are young enough to see it. Oh, if I were in a position to follow up my studies, I should complete my work on the possibility of a general coalition of Europe against England, and the part she is destined to play in the future.”\n\n“You spoke of England and the Stuarts,” replied Dantès, “and yet you seem to doubt if you will ever leave prison.”\n\n“Doubt is a word I do not understand,” said Faria. “I have had so many cruel disappointments, that I am now reconciled to them. My mind has been so long accustomed to the intellectual world, that I hardly look upon the real world as existing. I have been so long used to dwelling in thoughts, that they have become phantoms, and I people my cell with them and have conversations, which restore my strength and render life supportable. Then,” continued he, “when my mind is fatigued, I close my eyes and fancy I am again in Rome, among my friends the cardinals, or in Naples, in the midst of those gay and brilliant lords and ladies who used to welcome me with smiles.”\n\n“And how long have you been here?” asked Dantès.\n\n“Since 1807.”\n\n“Eighteen hundred and seven?” repeated Dantès. “Why, that is ten years ago.”\n\n“Yes; ten years I have been striving to forget the past in considering the future.”\n\n“But in 1807 what crime did you commit to be imprisoned?”\n\n“The crime I committed was that of having dreamed of the same thing as Alexander had contemplated before me, as Pius VII. had contemplated before me, as Machiavelli had contemplated before me—a united Italy, and of having sought to realize that dream.”\n\n“A united Italy?” repeated Dantès, who, zealous patriot as he was, understood nothing of the politics of which Faria spoke. “And in what way could you seek to realize this dream?”\n\n“By a very simple means—by a conspiracy to bring together the petty principalities, which form the mosaic work of Italy, into one great kingdom; and, further, to interest Napoleon in the success of this conspiracy.”\n\n“A conspiracy!” said Dantès, whose ideas ran on the conspiracies of the Château d’If, and who had become acquainted with that word only in its bad sense. “And how did you enter into this conspiracy?”\n\n“I was the soul of it. Every one acknowledged me as chief. The work was progressing. When Napoleon started for Tilsit, I had hopes of obtaining an audience; but whether the emperor was persuaded that it would be impossible to effect the union, or whether, like Cæsar, he mistrusted every one, he gave orders that I should be arrested. I was at Fenestrelle, and have been here since then.”\n\n“And have you never tried to escape?”\n\n“No; for I have never despaired of being set at liberty. They cannot have forgotten me. The Pope, the cardinals, King Joachim, have all interceded for me.”\n\n“And have they succeeded?” asked Dantès.\n\n“No; for Napoleon was afraid of me, and when Napoleon has fears, he never relents,” said Faria. “However, since the Restoration they have ceased to persecute me, and content themselves with letting me die quietly in my prison.”\n\n“But why did not the Pope, or King Joachim, or the cardinals, get you set at liberty after the Restoration?” asked Dantès.\n\n“Because,”",

Would it not be expecting too much to hope to succeed at your first attempt? Why not try to find an opening in another direction from that which has so unfortunately failed?”\n“Alas, it shows how little notion you can have of all it has cost me to effect a purpose so unexpectedly frustrated, that you talk of beginning over again. In the first place, I was four years making the tools I possess, and have been two years scraping and digging out earth, hard as granite itself; then what toil and fatigue has it not been to remove huge stones I should once have deemed impossible to loosen. Whole days have I passed in these Titanic efforts, considering my labor well repaid if, by night-time I had contrived to carry away a square inch of this hard-bound cement, changed by ages into a substance unyielding as the stones themselves; then to conceal the mass of earth and rubbish I dug up, I was compelled to break through a staircase, and throw the fruits of my labor into the hollow part of it; but the well is now so completely choked up, that I scarcely think it would be possible to add another handful of dust without leading to discovery. Consider also that I fully believed I had accomplished the end and aim of my undertaking, for which I had so exactly husbanded my strength as to make it just hold out to the termination of my enterprise; and now, at the moment when I reckoned upon success, my hopes are forever dashed from me. No, I repeat again, that nothing shall induce me to renew attempts evidently at variance with the Almighty’s pleasure.”\nDantès held down his head, that the other might not see how joy at the thought of having a companion outweighed the sympathy he felt for the failure of the abbé’s plans.\nThe abbé sank upon Edmond’s bed, while Edmond himself remained standing. Escape had never once occurred to him. There are, indeed, some things which appear so impossible that the mind does not dwell on them for an instant. To undermine the ground for fifty feet—to devote three years to a labor which, if successful, would conduct you to a precipice overhanging the sea—to plunge into the waves from the height of fifty, sixty, perhaps a hundred feet, at the risk of being dashed to pieces against the rocks, should you have been fortunate enough to have escaped the fire of the sentinels; and even, supposing all these perils past, then to have to swim for your life a distance of at least three miles ere you could reach the shore—were difficulties so startling and formidable that Dantès had never even dreamed of such a scheme, resigning himself rather to death.\nBut the sight of an old man clinging to life with so desperate a courage, gave a fresh turn to his ideas, and inspired him with new courage. Another, older and less strong than he, had attempted what he had not had sufficient resolution to undertake, and had failed only because of an error in calculation. This same person, with almost incredible patience and perseverance, had contrived to provide himself with tools requisite for so unparalleled an attempt. Another had done all this; why, then, was it impossible to Dantès? Faria had dug his way through fifty feet, Dantès would dig a hundred; Faria, at the age of fifty, had devoted three years to the task; he, who was but half as old, would sacrifice six; Faria, a priest and savant, had not shrunk from the idea of risking his life by trying to swim a distance of three miles to one of the islands—Daume, Rattonneau, or Lemaire; should a hardy sailor, an experienced diver, like himself, shrink from a similar task; should he, who had so often for mere amusement’s sake plunged to the bottom of the sea to fetch up the bright coral branch, hesitate to entertain the same project? He could do it in an hour, and how many times had he, for pure pastime, continued in the water for more than twice as long! At once Dantès resolved to follow the brave example of his energetic companion, and to remember that what has once been done may be done again.",

We must pierce through the corridor by forming a side opening about the middle, as it were the top part of a cross.

All we require to insure success is courage, and that you possess, and strength, which I am not deficient in; as for patience, you have abundantly proved yours—you shall now see me prove mine.”\n“One instant, my dear friend,” replied the abbé; “it is clear you do not understand the nature of the courage with which I am endowed, and what use I intend making of my strength. As for patience, I consider that I have abundantly exercised that in beginning every morning the task of the night before, and every night renewing the task of the day. But then, young man (and I pray of you to give me your full attention), then I thought I could not be doing anything displeasing to the Almighty in trying to set an innocent being at liberty—one who had committed no offence, and merited not condemnation.”\n“And have your notions changed?” asked Dantès with much surprise; “do you think yourself more guilty in making the attempt since you have encountered me?”\n“No; neither do I wish to incur guilt. Hitherto I have fancied myself merely waging war against circumstances, not men. I have thought it no sin to bore through a wall, or destroy a staircase; but I cannot so easily persuade myself to pierce a heart or take away a life.”\nA slight movement of surprise escaped Dantès.\n“Is it possible,” said he, “that where your liberty is at stake you can allow any such scruple to deter you from obtaining it?”\n“Tell me,” replied Faria, “what has hindered you from knocking down your jailer with a piece of wood torn from your bedstead, dressing yourself in his clothes, and endeavoring to escape?”\n“Simply the fact that the idea never occurred to me,” answered Dantès.\n“Because,” said the old man, “the natural repugnance to the commission of such a crime prevented you from thinking of it; and so it ever is because in simple and allowable things our natural instincts keep us from deviating from the strict line of duty. The tiger, whose nature teaches him to delight in shedding blood, needs but the sense of smell to show him when his prey is within his reach, and by following this instinct he is enabled to measure the leap necessary to permit him to spring on his victim; but man, on the contrary, loathes the idea of blood—it is not alone that the laws of social life inspire him with a shrinking dread of taking life; his natural construction and physiological formation——”\nDantès was confused and silent at this explanation of the thoughts which had unconsciously been working in his mind, or rather soul; for there are two distinct sorts of ideas, those that proceed from the head and those that emanate from the heart.",

But what is the connection between that prisoner and me?”\n\n“Ah, I have it!” cried Dantès; “the prisoner who was removed in 1811, and who was brought into this cell, was your father!”\n\nFaria again started. “My father!” he cried. “My father was a poor fisherman, and never left the island of Giglio.”\n\n“Then it was not your father?”\n\n“No.”\n\n“But,” said Dantès, hesitating, “it was a prisoner, an Italian, a learned man, an abbé.”\n\n“That is true; and I am an Italian, a learned man, an abbé.”\n\n“And you were in cell No. 27 in 1811?”\n\n“Yes.”\n\n“And you have remained there ever since?”\n\n“Yes.”\n\n“Then,” said Dantès, “I am utterly bewildered. There were two Italian abbés, named Faria, in the Chateau d’If in 1811?”\n\n“It would seem so,” replied Faria, with a smile.\n\n“But,” said Dantès, “that is impossible.”\n\n“Why so?”\n\n“Because,” said Dantès, “I have never heard of but one Abbé Faria.”\n\n“Nor I either,” said Faria.\n\n“Then,” said Dantès, “I am completely at fault.”\n\n“Let us recapitulate,” said Faria. “You say that in 1811, the jailer of the Chateau d’If conversed with a prisoner in cell No. 27, who was an Italian abbé, named Faria?”\n\n“Yes.”\n\n“And that prisoner was removed?”\n\n“Yes.”\n\n“And you say that I am that prisoner?”\n\n“Yes.”\n\n“But I was not removed.”\n\n“No; but you were in cell No. 27 in 1811, and have remained there ever since.”\n\n“That is true.”\n\n“Then,”",

You were seeking to discover when and how the Abbé Faria was removed from the Chateau d’If?”\n\n“Precisely, my dear boy; precisely.”\n\n“Well, then, I have found it!”\n\n“And when was it?” asked Faria, with an interest so intense that his eyes seemed to dilate to twice their ordinary size.\n\n“In 1811.”\n\n“In 1811? Impossible!

But what was that occupant’s name?”\n\n“He was an Italian abbé, named Faria.”\n\n“Precisely; and I am also an Italian abbé, and my name is Faria, and I have been here since 1811.”\n\n“It was not you, then?”\n\n“No; and yet I was in cell No. 27 in 1811, and have remained there ever since.”\n\n“But,” cried Dantès, “I do not understand it at all.

Those that have been crowned with full success have been long meditated upon, and carefully arranged; such, for instance, as the escape of the Duc de Beaufort from the Château de Vincennes, that of the Abbé Dubuquoi from For l’Evêque; of Latude from the Bastille. Then there are those for which chance sometimes affords opportunity, and those are the best of all. Let us, therefore, wait patiently for some favorable moment, and when it presents itself, profit by it.”\n“Ah,” said Dantès, “you might well endure the tedious delay; you were constantly employed in the task you set yourself, and when weary with toil, you had your hopes to refresh and encourage you.”\n“I assure you,” replied the old man, “I did not turn to that source for recreation or support.”\n“What did you do then?”\n“I wrote or studied.”\n“Were you then permitted the use of pens, ink, and paper?”\n“Oh, no,” answered the abbé; “I had none but what I made for myself.”\n“You made paper, pens and ink?”\n“Yes.”\nDantès gazed with admiration, but he had some difficulty in believing. Faria saw this.\n“When you pay me a visit in my cell, my young friend,” said he, “I will show you an entire work, the fruits of the thoughts and reflections of my whole life; many of them meditated over in the shades of the Colosseum at Rome, at the foot of St. Mark’s column at Venice, and on the borders of the Arno at Florence, little imagining at the time that they would be arranged in order within the walls of the Château d’If. The work I speak of is called A Treatise on the Possibility of a General Monarchy in Italy, and will make one large quarto volume.”\n“And on what have you written all this?”\n“On two of my shirts. I invented a preparation that makes linen as smooth and as easy to write on as parchment.”\n“You are, then, a chemist?”\n“Somewhat; I know Lavoisier, and was the intimate friend of Cabanis.”\n“But for such a work you must have needed books—had you any?”\n“I had nearly five thousand volumes in my library at Rome; but after reading them over many times, I found out that with one hundred and fifty well-chosen books a man possesses, if not a complete summary of all human knowledge, at least all that a man need really know. I devoted three years of my life to reading and studying these one hundred and fifty volumes, till I knew them nearly by heart; so that since I have been in prison, a very slight effort of memory has enabled me to recall their contents as readily as though the pages were open before me. I could recite you the whole of Thucydides, Xenophon, Plutarch, Titus Livius, Tacitus, Strada, Jornandes, Dante, Montaigne, Shakespeare, Spinoza, Machiavelli, and Bossuet. I name only the most important.”\n“You are, doubtless, acquainted with a variety of languages, so as to have been able to read all these?”\n“Yes, I speak five of the modern tongues—that is to say, German, French, Italian, English, and Spanish; by the aid of ancient Greek I learned modern Greek—I don’t speak it so well as I could wish, but I am still trying to improve myself.”\n“Improve yourself!” repeated Dantès; “why, how can you manage to do so?”\n“Why, I made a vocabulary of the words I knew; turned, returned, and arranged them, so as to enable me to express my thoughts through their medium. I know nearly one thousand words, which is all that is absolutely necessary, although I believe there are nearly one hundred thousand in the dictionaries. I cannot hope to be very fluent, but I certainly should have no difficulty in explaining my wants and wishes; and that would be quite as much as I should ever require.”\nStronger grew the wonder of Dantès, who almost fancied he had to do with one gifted with supernatural powers; still hoping to find some imperfection which might bring him down to a level with human beings, he added, “Then if you were not furnished with pens, how did you manage to write the work you speak of?”\n“I made myself some excellent ones, which would be universally preferred to all others if once known. You are aware what huge whitings are served to us on maigre days. Well, I selected the cartilages of the heads of these fishes, and you can scarcely imagine the delight with which I welcomed the arrival of each Wednesday, Friday, and Saturday, as affording me the means of increasing my stock of pens; for I will freely confess that my historical labors have been my greatest solace and relief. While retracing the past, I forget the present; and traversing at will the path of history I cease to remember that I am myself a prisoner.”\n“But the ink,” said Dantès; “of what did you make your ink?”\n“There was formerly a fireplace in my dungeon,” replied Faria, “but it was closed up long ere I became an occupant of this prison. Still, it must have been many years in use, for it was thickly covered with a coating of soot; this soot I dissolved in a portion of the wine brought to me every Sunday, and I assure you a better ink cannot be desired. For very important notes, for which closer attention is required, I pricked one of my fingers, and wrote with my own blood.”\n“And when,” asked Dantès, “may I see all this?”\n“Whenever you please,” replied the abbé.\n“Oh, then let it be directly!” exclaimed the young man.\n“Follow me, then,” said the abbé, as he re-entered the subterranean passage, in which he soon disappeared, followed by Dantès.",

There was Latude, who, after a captivity of thirty-five years, escaped from the Bastille; there was Trenck, who escaped from the fortress of Glatz; Casanova, who escaped from the Leads of Venice. These escapes were effected successfully; and they were owing, in my opinion, to one of three causes:—either they were favoured by circumstances, or there was a combination of favourable circumstances at a given moment, or the prisoners in question found some one to pity them, and help them in their efforts. I have been in prison now for fourteen years, and during that time I have had neither a providential circumstance in my favour, nor any pity shown me, and I have had only my own thoughts to depend on. Besides, Latude and Trenck and Casanova were in European prisons, while I am in an African prison. The Château d’If has walls fifty feet thick, and gates of iron; besides, I am at a considerable depth underground.”\n\n“So that you have given up all hope of escape?” said Dantès.\n\n“No, not of escape, but of escape by the means I have mentioned, and which have hitherto been the only ones successful.”\n\n“And what means are left to you, then?”\n\n“The means that are left to people who have no other means,” said Faria, smiling; “that is, patience.”\n\n“However,” said Dantès, “I have heard you say that you were constantly working; you would not do that if you were without hope.”\n\n“I work constantly,” returned Faria, “but not with the hope of escaping; on the contrary, I am almost certain that I shall never escape. My solace is not that hope, but my work, and I work to divert myself. Since I have been here I have written a book.”\n\n“A book! In prison?”\n\n“Yes, it is a treatise on the possibility of a general monarchy in Italy, and the chances of its success.”\n\n“And on what have you written it?”\n\n“On two shirts. I invented a preparation which makes linen as smooth and as firm as parchment.”\n\n“You are a singular man,” said Dantès, “and your inventions are admirable.”\n\n“I am more than that, my friend; I am a learned man. I was a favourite of the great and unfortunate Lavoisier, who was my friend, and who, when he was in prison, predicted that I should one day be as learned as himself. He was mistaken; I have gone far beyond him.”\n\n“But how have you been able to study without books?”\n\n“Ah, I had a library of nearly five thousand volumes in my château at Rome. When I was arrested, I was allowed to take nothing with me but my breviary. From that breviary, which was a very large one, I tore out all the blank leaves, and on them, with a toothpick dipped in soot and wine, I wrote the names of all my books, and the subjects of which they treated. I then divided them into classes, and I found that out of the five thousand volumes, one hundred and fifty well-chosen books contained all that was essential for a man to know. I devoted three years to studying these one hundred and fifty books, until I knew them by heart; and now, when I wish to recall any passage, I have only to shut my eyes, and I see the page on which it is printed, and I read it as if it were before me.”\n\n“And you have no fear of forgetting?”\n\n“No, for I have a method of artificial memory, which is very simple, and which I have never known to fail. Besides, I am constantly reviewing my knowledge, and I find that I am always adding to it.”\n\n“But you speak five or six languages, do you not?”\n\n“Yes, I speak German, French, Italian, English, and Spanish. I learned modern Greek by studying ancient Greek, and I have a vocabulary of nearly a thousand essential words, which I am constantly increasing.”\n\n“You are a prodigy,” said Dantès.\n\n“No, I am only a man who has had the misfortune to be imprisoned, and who has endeavoured to make the best of his misfortune.”\n\n“But how did you make your pens?”\n\n“Ah, that was a difficulty. I had no pens, and I could not get any. I was in despair. One day, when I was eating a maigre, I found that the cartilage of the head of a whiting was very hard and sharp. I took it, and I tried to write with it. It did very well. Since then, I have always eaten maigre on the days when I have had anything to write, and I have always found a pen in the head of my whiting. My historical labours have been my greatest relief from the present.”\n\n“And your ink?”\n\n“Ah, my ink! That was another difficulty. I had no ink, and I could not get any. I was in despair. One day, when I was cleaning out my cell, I found that there was a great deal of soot in the chimney. I took some of the soot, and I mixed it with some of the wine that was allowed me on Sundays. It made a very good ink.

I have analyzed the construction of this fortress, the thickness of the walls, the position of the towers, the depth of the ditches; I have calculated the chances, and I have come to the conclusion that escape is possible, but only by the most extraordinary perseverance and ingenuity.”\n\nHe paused, his eyes, though dimmed by age and suffering, still holding a spark of fierce determination. “My first attempt was made years ago. I had managed to procure a small file, hidden in the binding of a book smuggled in by a sympathetic guard – a man who has long since been replaced. With this file, over the course of months, working only when the guards were distant or asleep, I began to wear away at the stone in the corner of my cell, the corner I judged to be closest to the outer wall. I calculated the direction by the position of the sun at different times of the day, and the distance by the number of steps a guard took to pass my door and return. It was a painstaking, agonizing labor. My fingers bled, my nails broke, but I persisted. Hope was my only companion.”\n\nHe sighed, a sound like dry leaves rustling. “After two years of this secret toil, I believed I was close. I had excavated a passage perhaps twenty feet long. I was working one night, my heart pounding with anticipation, when my file struck something different – not stone, but metal. I had reached a drainpipe, a large, iron conduit running vertically down the wall. My calculations had been flawed. I had aimed for the outer wall, but instead, I had dug towards the interior of the fortress, towards the very heart of the building, where escape was impossible. Despair seized me. I filled in the passage as best I could, concealing my work, and for a long time, I gave up hope. I resigned myself to dying in this tomb.”\n\nHe looked at Dantès, a flicker of something akin to pity in his gaze. “Then, about a year ago, I heard a sound. A faint, rhythmic scraping, coming from the wall opposite my bed. At first, I thought it was a rat, or perhaps the wind. But it continued, day after day, week after week. It was the sound of someone digging. Someone else imprisoned, someone else with the same desperate hope. I listened intently, trying to gauge the direction and distance. It seemed to be coming from a cell adjacent to mine, separated by a thick wall.”\n\n“I decided to try and communicate. I tapped on the wall, using a code I had devised years before – a simple system of taps representing letters. I tapped out, ‘Who are you?’ There was a long silence, and then, hesitantly, a series of taps came back. It was slow, uncertain, but it was a response. The taps spelled out, ‘A prisoner.’ My heart leaped. I tapped again, ‘What are you doing?’ The reply came, ‘Digging.’ I tapped, ‘Where are you digging?’ The answer was, ‘Towards the outer wall.’ My own failed attempt had taught me caution. I tapped, ‘Be careful. I dug towards the interior.’ There was a pause, a longer one this time, and then a frantic series of taps. ‘Who are you? How do you know?’ I tapped back, ‘I am a prisoner. I have been here for many years. I have tried to escape.’\n\n“We continued to communicate in this way, tapping our messages through the stone. I learned your name, Edmond Dantès. You learned mine, Abbé Faria. We shared our stories, our hopes, our despair. I guided you, warning you of the dangers, advising you on the best tools to use. I told you how to fashion a pickaxe from the handle of a saucepan, a lever from a bedpost, a chisel from a candlestick. You were young, strong, and full of fire. You worked with incredible energy.”\n\n“After many months of this subterranean correspondence, we calculated that we were close to meeting. We agreed on a night to make the final push. I began digging from my side, you from yours. The sound of our tools grew louder, closer. The excitement was almost unbearable. And then, one night, your pickaxe broke through the wall into my cell. It was a small opening at first, just large enough to pass a hand through, but it was a breach! We had done it. We had connected our two worlds.”\n\nHe smiled, a rare, genuine smile that illuminated his face. “You widened the opening, and you crawled through. I saw you then, for the first time. A young man, covered in dust and sweat, but with eyes that shone with intelligence and courage. You were not the simple sailor I had expected, but a man of great potential.”\n\n“From that moment on, we were no longer two isolated prisoners, but partners. We combined our efforts. We decided to continue digging from my cell, as it was closer to the direction we now believed led to freedom. We worked in shifts, one digging while the other kept watch or rested. The labor was immense. The stone was hard, the air was thick and stif"

          "text_segment": "After having passed with tolerable ease through the subterranean passage, which, however, did not admit of their holding themselves erect, the two friends reached the further end of the corridor, into which the abbé’s cell opened; from that point the passage became much narrower, and barely permitted one to creep through on hands and knees. The floor of the abbé’s cell was paved, and it had been by raising one of the stones in the most obscure corner that Faria had been able to commence the laborious task of which Dantès had witnessed the completion.\nAs he entered the chamber of his friend, Dantès cast around one eager and searching glance in quest of the expected marvels, but nothing more than common met his view.\n“It is well,” said the abbé; “we have some hours before us—it is now just a quarter past twelve o’clock.” Instinctively Dantès turned round to observe by what watch or clock the abbé had been able so accurately to specify the hour.\n“Look at this ray of light which enters by my window,” said the abbé, “and then observe the lines traced on the wall. Well, by means of these lines, which are in accordance with the double motion of the earth, and the ellipse it describes round the sun, I am enabled to ascertain the precise hour with more minuteness than if I possessed a watch; for that might be broken or deranged in its movements, while the sun and earth never vary in their appointed paths.”\nThis last explanation was wholly lost upon Dantès, who had always imagined, from seeing the sun rise from behind the mountains and set in the Mediterranean, that it moved, and not the earth. A double movement of the globe he inhabited, and of which he could feel nothing, appeared to him perfectly impossible. Each word that fell from his companion’s lips seemed fraught with the mysteries of science, as worthy of digging out as the gold and diamonds in the mines of Guzerat and Golconda, which he could just recollect having visited during a voyage made in his earliest youth.\n“Come,” said he to the abbé, “I am anxious to see your treasures.”\nThe abbé smiled, and, proceeding to the disused fireplace, raised, by the help of his chisel, a long stone, which had doubtless been the hearth, beneath which was a cavity of considerable depth, serving as a safe depository of the articles mentioned to Dantès.\n“What do you wish to see first?” asked the abbé.\n“Oh, your great work on the monarchy of Italy!”\nFaria then drew forth from his hiding-place three or four rolls of linen, laid one over the other, like folds of papyrus. These rolls consisted of slips of cloth about four inches wide and eighteen long; they were all carefully numbered and closely covered with writing, so legible that Dantès could easily read it, as well as make out the sense—it being in Italian, a language he, as a Provençal, perfectly understood.\n“There,” said he, “there is the work complete. I wrote the word finis at the end of the sixty-eighth strip about a week ago. I have torn up two of my shirts, and as many handkerchiefs as I was master of, to complete the precious pages. Should I ever get out of prison and find in all Italy a printer courageous enough to publish what I have composed, my literary reputation is forever secured.”\n“I see,” answered Dantès. “Now let me behold the curious pens with which you have written your work.”\n“Look!” said Faria, showing to the young man a slender stick about six inches long, and much resembling the size of the handle of a fine painting-brush, to the end of which was tied, by a piece of thread, one of those cartilages of which the abbé had before spoken to Dantès; it was pointed, and divided at the nib like an ordinary pen. Dantès examined it with intense admiration, then looked around to see the instrument with which it had been shaped so correctly into form.\n“Ah, yes,” said Faria; “the penknife. That’s my masterpiece. I made it, as well as this larger knife, out of an old iron candlestick.” The penknife was sharp and keen as a razor; as for the other knife, it would serve a double purpose, and with it one could cut and thrust.\nDantès examined the various articles shown to him with the same attention that he had bestowed on the curiosities and strange tools exhibited in the shops at Marseilles as the works of the savages in the South Seas from whence they had been brought by the different trading vessels.\n“As for the ink,” said Faria, “I told you how I managed to obtain that—and I only just make it from time to time, as I require it.”\n“One thing still puzzles me,” observed Dantès, “and that is how you managed to do all this by daylight?”\n“I worked at night also,” replied Faria.\n“Night!—why, for Heaven’s sake, are your eyes like cats’, that you can see to work in the dark?”\n“Indeed they are not; but God has supplied man with the intelligence that enables him to overcome the limitations of natural conditions. I furnished myself with a light.”\n“You did? Pray tell me how.”\n“I separated the fat from the meat served to me, melted it, and so made oil—here is my lamp.” So saying, the abbé exhibited a sort of torch very similar to those used in public illuminations.\n“But how do you procure a light?”\n“Oh, here are two flints and a piece of burnt linen.”\n“And matches?”\n“I pretended that I had a disorder of the skin, and asked for a little sulphur, which was readily supplied.”\nDantès laid the different things he had been looking at on the table, and stood with his head drooping on his breast, as though overwhelmed by the perseverance and strength of Faria’s mind.\n“You have not seen all yet,” continued Faria, “for I did not think it wise to trust all my treasures in the same hiding-place. Let us shut this one up.” They put the stone back in its place; the abbé sprinkled a little dust over it to conceal the traces of its having been removed, rubbed his foot well on it to make it assume the same appearance as the other, and then, going towards his bed, he removed it from the spot it stood in. Behind the head of the bed, and concealed by a stone fitting in so closely as to defy all suspicion, was a hollow space, and in this space a ladder of cords between twenty-five and thirty feet in length. Dantès closely and eagerly examined it; he found it firm, solid, and compact enough to bear any weight.\n“Who supplied you with the materials for making this wonderful work?”\n“I tore up several of my shirts, and ripped out the seams in the sheets of my bed, during my three years’ imprisonment at Fenestrelle; and when I was removed to the Château d’If, I managed to bring the ravellings with me, so that I have been able to finish my work here.”\n“And was it not discovered that your sheets were unhemmed?”\n“Oh, no, for when I had taken out the thread I required, I hemmed the edges over again.”\n“With what?”\n“With this needle,” said the abbé, as, opening his ragged vestments, he showed Dantès a long, sharp fish-bone, with a small perforated eye for the thread, a small portion of which still remained in it.\n“I once thought,” continued Faria, “of removing these iron bars, and letting myself down from the window, which, as you see, is somewhat wider than yours, although I should have enlarged it still more preparatory to my flight; however, I discovered that I should merely have dropped into a sort of inner court, and I therefore renounced the project altogether as too full of risk and danger. Nevertheless, I carefully preserved my ladder against one of those unforeseen opportunities of which I spoke just now, and which sudden chance frequently brings about.”\nWhile affecting to be deeply engaged in examining the ladder, the mind of Dantès was, in fact, busily occupied by the idea that a person so intelligent, ingenious, and clear-sighted as the abbé might probably be able to solve the dark mystery of his own misfortunes, where he himself could see nothing.",

Dantès preceded his guide, and the latter followed him. In a short time Dantès had passed through the opening, and stood erect in the centre of the cell. Faria followed, and with the help of Dantès closed the stone. The darkness was profound. The abbé sought the tinder-box and struck a light. The lamp was instantly lighted and Dantès could survey the place. It was a cell similar to his own, but there were books, paper, and various instruments, which Dantès knew the use of. The abbé was in the act of consulting a long tube of tin, which he applied to the walls. “It is to ascertain the thickness of the walls,” said the abbé, “and by the thickness of the walls I can calculate the number of yards that separate me from the gallery.” “No doubt,” said Dantès, “but how can you tell the thickness of the walls?” “Oh, I have a very simple method. I make use of the knowledge I acquired at the seminary at Rome.” “You were at the seminary at Rome?” “For four years. I studied theology, mathematics, and physics. I was intended for the church, but I preferred to devote myself to science.” “And you have made great progress?” “I hope so. I have discovered a method of telling the time by the sun, and I have also discovered a method of telling the time by the moon.” “Indeed?” said Dantès. “Yes, and I have also discovered a method of telling the time by the stars.” “You are a wonderful man,” said Dantès. “Not at all. I have merely made use of the knowledge I acquired at the seminary at Rome.” “And you have been here for how long?” “For fourteen years.” “Fourteen years!” exclaimed Dantès. “Yes, fourteen years. And during that time I have not seen a human face, except that of the jailer.” “It is a long time,” said Dantès. “It is,” said the abbé. “But I have not been idle. I have been at work.” “At work?” “Yes, at work. I have been writing a book.” “A book?” “Yes, a book. A history of the Italian monarchy.” “Indeed?” said Dantès. “Yes, indeed.

          "text_segment": "What are you thinking of?” asked the abbé smilingly, imputing the deep abstraction in which his visitor was plunged to the excess of his awe and wonder.\n“I was reflecting, in the first place,” replied Dantès, “upon the enormous degree of intelligence and ability you must have employed to reach the high perfection to which you have attained. What would you not have accomplished if you had been free?”\n“Possibly nothing at all; the overflow of my brain would probably, in a state of freedom, have evaporated in a thousand follies; misfortune is needed to bring to light the treasures of the human intellect. Compression is needed to explode gunpowder. Captivity has brought my mental faculties to a focus; and you are well aware that from the collision of clouds electricity is produced—from electricity, lightning, from lightning, illumination.”\n“No,” replied Dantès. “I know nothing. Some of your words are to me quite empty of meaning. You must be blessed indeed to possess the knowledge you have.”\nThe abbé smiled. “Well,” said he, “but you had another subject for your thoughts; did you not say so just now?”\n“I did!”\n“You have told me as yet but one of them—let me hear the other.”\n“It was this,—that while you had related to me all the particulars of your past life, you were perfectly unacquainted with mine.”\n“Your life, my young friend, has not been of sufficient length to admit of your having passed through any very important events.”\n“It has been long enough to inflict on me a great and undeserved misfortune. I would fain fix the source of it on man that I may no longer vent reproaches upon Heaven.”\n“Then you profess ignorance of the crime with which you are charged?”\n“I do, indeed; and this I swear by the two beings most dear to me upon earth,—my father and Mercédès.”\n“Come,” said the abbé, closing his hiding-place, and pushing the bed back to its original situation, “let me hear your story.”\nDantès obeyed, and commenced what he called his history, but which consisted only of the account of a voyage to India, and two or three voyages to the Levant, until he arrived at the recital of his last cruise, with the death of Captain Leclere, and the receipt of a packet to be delivered by himself to the grand marshal; his interview with that personage, and his receiving, in place of the packet brought, a letter addressed to a Monsieur Noirtier—his arrival at Marseilles, and interview with his father—his affection for Mercédès, and their nuptual feast—his arrest and subsequent examination, his temporary detention at the Palais de Justice, and his final imprisonment in the Château d’If. From this point everything was a blank to Dantès—he knew nothing more, not even the length of time he had been imprisoned. His recital finished, the abbé reflected long and earnestly.\n“There is,” said he, at the end of his meditations, “a clever maxim, which bears upon what I was saying to you some little while ago, and that is, that unless wicked ideas take root in a naturally depraved mind, human nature, in a right and wholesome state, revolts at crime. Still, from an artificial civilization have originated wants, vices, and false tastes, which occasionally become so powerful as to stifle within us all good feelings, and ultimately to lead us into guilt and wickedness. From this view of things, then, comes the axiom that if you visit to discover the author of any bad action, seek first to discover the person to whom the perpetration of that bad action could be in any way advantageous. Now, to apply it in your case,—to whom could your disappearance have been serviceable?”\n“To no one, by Heaven! I was a very insignificant person.”\n“Do not speak thus, for your reply evinces neither logic nor philosophy; everything is relative, my dear young friend, from the king who stands in the way of his successor, to the employee who keeps his rival out of a place. Now, in the event of the king’s death, his successor inherits a crown,—when the employee dies, the supernumerary steps into his shoes, and receives his salary of twelve thousand livres. Well, these twelve thousand livres are his civil list, and are as essential to him as the twelve millions of a king. Everyone, from the highest to the lowest degree, has his place on the social ladder, and is beset by stormy passions and conflicting interests, as in Descartes’ theory of pressure and impulsion. But these forces increase as we go higher, so that we have a spiral which in defiance of reason rests upon the apex and not on the base. Now let us return to your particular world. You say you were on the point of being made captain of the Pharaon?”\n“Yes.”\n“And about to become the husband of a young and lovely girl?”\n“Yes.”\n“Now, could anyone have had any interest in preventing the accomplishment of these two things? But let us first settle the question as to its being the interest of anyone to hinder you from being captain of the Pharaon. What say you?”\n“I cannot believe such was the case. I was generally liked on board, and had the sailors possessed the right of selecting a captain themselves, I feel convinced their choice would have fallen on me. There was only one person among the crew who had any feeling of ill-will towards me. I had quarelled with him some time previously, and had even challenged him to fight me; but he refused.”\n“Now we are getting on. And what was this man’s name?”\n“Danglars.”\n“What rank did he hold on board?”\n“He was supercargo.”\n“And had you been captain, should you have retained him in his employment?”\n“Not if the choice had remained with me, for I had frequently observed inaccuracies in his accounts.”\n“Good again! Now then, tell me, was any person present during your last conversation with Captain Leclere?”\n“No; we were quite alone.”\n“Could your conversation have been overheard by anyone?”\n“It might, for the cabin door was open—and—stay; now I recollect,—Danglars himself passed by just as Captain Leclere was giving me the packet for the grand marshal.”\n“That’s better,” cried the abbé; “now we are on the right scent. Did you take anybody with you when you put into the port of Elba?”\n“Nobody.”\n“Somebody there received your packet, and gave you a letter in place of it, I think?”\n“Yes; the grand marshal did.”\n“And what did you do with that letter?”\n“Put it into my portfolio.”\n“You had your portfolio with you, then? Now, how could a sailor find room in his pocket for a portfolio large enough to contain an official letter?”\n“You are right; it was left on board.”\n“Then it was not till your return to the ship that you put the letter in the portfolio?”\n“No.”\n“And what did you do with this same letter while returning from Porto-Ferrajo to the vessel?”\n“I carried it in my hand.”\n“So that when you went on board the Pharaon, everybody could see that you held a letter in your hand?”\n“Yes.”\n“Danglars, as well as the rest?”\n“Danglars, as well as others.”\n“Now, listen to me, and try to recall every circumstance attending your arrest. Do you recollect the words in which the information against you was formulated?”\n“Oh yes, I read it over three times, and the words sank deeply into my memory.”\n“Repeat it to me.”\nDantès paused a moment, then said, “This is it, word for word: ‘The king’s attorney is informed by a friend to the throne and religion, that one Edmond Dantès, mate on board the Pharaon, this day arrived from Smyrna, after having touched at Naples and Porto-Ferrajo, has been intrusted by Murat with a packet for the usurper; again, by the usurper, with a letter for the Bonapartist Club in Paris. This proof of his guilt may be procured by his immediate arrest, as the letter will be found either about his person, at his father’s residence, or in his cabin on board the Pharaon.’”\nThe abbé shrugged his shoulders. “The thing is clear as day,” said he; “and you must have had a very confiding nature, as well as a good heart, not to have suspected the origin of the whole affair.”\n“Do you really think so? Ah, that would indeed be infamous.”\n“How did Danglars usually write?”\n“In a handsome, running hand.”\n“And how was the anonymous letter written?”\n“Backhanded.”\nAgain the abbé smiled. “Disguised.”\n“It was very boldly written, if disguised.”\n“Stop a bit,” said the abbé, taking up what he called his pen, and, after dipping it into the ink, he wrote on a piece of prepared linen, with his left hand, the first two or three words of the accusation. Dantès drew back, and gazed on the abbé with a sensation almost amounting to terror.\n“How very astonishing!” cried he at length. “Why your writing exactly resembles that of the accusation.”\n“Simply because that accusation had been written with the left hand; and I have noticed that——”\n“What?”\n“That while the writing of different persons done with the right hand varies, that performed with the left hand is invariably uniform.”\n“You have evidently seen and observed everything.”\n“Let us proceed.”\n“Oh, yes, yes!”\n“Now as regards the second question.”\n“I am listening.”\n“Was there any person whose interest it was to prevent your marriage with Mercédès?”\n“Yes; a young man who loved her.”\n“And his name was——”\n“Fernand.”\n“That is a Spanish name, I think?”\n“He was a Catalan.”\n“You imagine him capable of writing the letter?”\n“Oh, no; he would more likely have got rid of me by sticking a knife into me.”\n“That is in strict accordance with the Spanish character; an assassination they will unhesitatingly commit, but an act of cowardice, never.”\n“Besides,” said Dantès, “the various circumstances mentioned in the letter were wholly unknown to him.”\n“You had never spoken of them yourself to anyone?”\n“To no one.”\n“Not even to your mistress?”\n“No, not even to my betrothed.”\n“Then it is Danglars.”\n“I feel quite sure of it now.”\n“Wait a little. Pray, was Danglars acquainted with Fernand?”\n“No—yes, he was. Now I recollect——”\n“What?”\n“To have seen them both sitting at table together under an arbor at Père Pamphile’s the evening before the day fixed for my wedding. They were in earnest conversation. Danglars was joking in a friendly way, but Fernand looked pale and agitated.”\n“Were they alone?”\n“There was a third person with them whom I knew perfectly well, and who had, in all probability made their acquaintance; he was a tailor named Caderousse, but he was very drunk. Stay!—stay!—How strange that it should not have occurred to me before! Now I remember quite well, that on the table round which they were sitting were pens, ink, and paper. Oh, the heartless, treacherous scoundrels!” exclaimed Dantès, pressing his hand to his throbbing brows.",

But I have also had sweet hours, during which I have already reaped the reward of my labors. Have I not told you that I was rich before I came here, and that I have found here a treasure of two thousand times that which I possessed?” Dantès shook his head. “The treasures you speak of, father, are completely useless to you in prison.” “To me, who have no desire but that of knowledge, which I can acquire here as well as anywhere else, these riches are as profitable as their possession would be in the hands of a miser or a prince.” “With the one exception,” said Dantès, “that you can neither satisfy your avarice nor employ your millions, while the miser would double his gains and the prince would employ his to extend his kingdom.” “That is true. But they would not enjoy the real capital. The capital of knowledge, double or treble, compared to that which I possessed, is now so large that I can die with the assurance that I have not lived in vain.” “But all your riches, all your treasures, are they not useless to others? Since you are here, you can neither make a grand discovery, nor even a useful application of your science.” “That is the error into which you fall, and in which so many others have fallen, and which has caused the misfortune of so many others. It is that you do not understand that I have been working for others, and that I have been working for you.” “For me?” “Yes, for you. Have I not taught you languages, history, geography, philosophy, mathematics, and even the art of fencing?” “Yes, father, you have taught me all this.” “And have I not given you a knowledge of the world, of men, of their passions, of their interests, of their vices, of their virtues?” “Yes, father, you have given me all this.” “And have I not, in short, made you a man?” “Yes, father, you have made me a man.” “And is not this a treasure more precious than all the gold and all the jewels in the world?” “Yes, father, it is a treasure more precious than all the gold and all the jewels in the world.” “And is it not a treasure that you can employ, that you can make useful to others, that you can make profitable to yourself?” “Yes, father, it is a treasure that I can employ, that I can make useful to others, that I can make profitable to myself.” “And is it not a treasure that will enable you to be happy, to be rich, to be powerful?” “Yes, father, it is a treasure that will enable me to be happy, to be rich, to be powerful.” “And is it not a treasure that will enable you to avenge yourself?” “Yes, father, it is a treasure that will enable me to avenge myself.” “And is not this a treasure that is worth more than all the treasures of the earth?” “Yes, father, it is a treasure that is worth more than all the treasures of the earth.” “Then you see,” said the abbé, “that I have not worked in vain, and that I have not been useless to others.” “No, father, you have not worked in vain, and you have not been useless to others.” “And now,” said the abbé, “let us return to the subject that occupied us before.

gained if you had not come here.” “Yes, father, I was also reflecting on all this.” “And you were also reflecting,” said the abbé, “on the difference that there is between the power that I possess,

always a misfortune, and that it is sometimes a blessing.” “And you see,” said the abbé, “that I have not been useless to you, and that I have not worked in vain.” “Yes, father, I see that you have not been useless to me, and that you have not worked in vain.” “And now,” said the abbé, “let us speak of yourself.

            "prefix-probing": "What are you thinking of?” asked the abbé smilingly, imputing the deep abstraction in which his visitor was plunged to the excess of his awe and wonder. Dantès started, as if roused from a dream, and looked at the abbé with eyes still wide with astonishment. “I am thinking, Father,” he replied, his voice hushed, “of the difference between you and me. Of the vastness of your knowledge, which seems to encompass the world, and my own utter ignorance. I am thinking of the fate that brought us together, you, a man who knows everything, and I, a man who knew nothing but sorrow and injustice. I am thinking… I am thinking that you are more than a man; you are a living miracle.”\n\nThe abbé’s smile softened. “My son,” he said gently, “knowledge is not a miracle; it is the fruit of labor and study. And sorrow and injustice, while bitter, can also be teachers, sharpening the mind and hardening the spirit. You have learned much in this place, Edmond, perhaps more than you realize. You have learned patience, endurance, and the value of a true friend.” He paused, his gaze steady on Dantès. “But you are right; there is a great disparity in our understanding of the world. And it is that disparity I wish to address. You asked me once why I, a man of God and learning, was imprisoned here. I told you it was for political reasons, for dreaming of a united Italy. That is true, but it is not the whole truth. My imprisonment is also linked to a secret, a secret that has been my companion for years, a secret that could change your life, should you ever leave this place.”\n\nDantès leaned forward, his heart pounding. The abbé’s words held a gravity that transcended their prison walls. “A secret, Father? What secret could be so great?”\n\nThe abbé rose slowly, his movements deliberate despite his frailty. He walked to the corner of the cell where his tools lay hidden – the pickaxe, the lever, the fragments of stone. He picked up a small, worn book, its cover faded and its pages brittle with age. “This book, Edmond,” he said, returning to his seat, “is the key to that secret. It is a theological treatise, written in Latin, by a cardinal of the Spada family, who lived in the fifteenth century.”\n\nDantès looked at the book with curiosity, but saw nothing remarkable about it. “A theological treatise?” he echoed, puzzled.\n\n“Yes,” the abbé confirmed. “But within its pages, hidden by a cunning cipher, lies the will of Cardinal Spada, one of the wealthiest men of his time. A will that was never executed, a fortune that was never claimed.”\n\nA fortune? The word hung in the air, incongruous with their surroundings. Dantès could only stare. “A fortune? But… how?”\n\nThe abbé settled back, his eyes distant, as if looking into the past. “The Spada family was ancient and powerful, their wealth accumulated over centuries through commerce, banking, and alliances. Cardinal Cesare Spada was the last direct male heir. He lived during a turbulent time in Italy, the era of the Borgias, a time of poisonings, assassinations, and political intrigue. The Cardinal, a man of foresight and caution, foresaw the dangers. He knew that his vast wealth made him a target, and that upon his death, his fortune would likely be seized by the rapacious powers of the day, perhaps even the Pope himself, Alexander VI, a Borgia.”\n\nHe paused, allowing the historical context to sink in. “The Cardinal had a nephew, Guido Spada, whom he loved dearly and wished to inherit his wealth. But he knew that a simple will bequeathing everything to Guido would be useless; the fortune would be confiscated before Guido could claim it. So, the Cardinal devised a plan. He decided to hide his treasure, not in a bank or a vault, but in a place known only to himself, and to leave instructions for its recovery in a manner that would escape the notice of his enemies.”\n\nThe abbé tapped the old book. “He wrote his will, a legitimate document, stating that he bequeathed to his nephew Guido all his possessions, his library, his collections, save for his palace and his revenues, which were to be sold to provide masses for his soul. This will was publicly known."

          "text_segment": "Is there anything else I can assist you in discovering, besides the villany of your friends?” inquired the abbé with a laugh.\n“Yes, yes,” replied Dantès eagerly; “I would beg of you, who see so completely to the depths of things, and to whom the greatest mystery seems but an easy riddle, to explain to me how it was that I underwent no second examination, was never brought to trial, and, above all, was condemned without ever having had sentence passed on me?”\n“That is altogether a different and more serious matter,” responded the abbé. “The ways of justice are frequently too dark and mysterious to be easily penetrated. All we have hitherto done in the matter has been child’s play. If you wish me to enter upon the more difficult part of the business, you must assist me by the most minute information on every point.”\n“Pray ask me whatever questions you please; for, in good truth, you see more clearly into my life than I do myself.”\n“In the first place, then, who examined you,—the king’s attorney, his deputy, or a magistrate?”\n“The deputy.”\n“Was he young or old?”\n“About six or seven-and-twenty years of age, I should say.”\n“So,” answered the abbé. “Old enough to be ambitious, but too young to be corrupt. And how did he treat you?”\n“With more of mildness than severity.”\n“Did you tell him your whole story?”\n“I did.”\n“And did his conduct change at all in the course of your examination?”\n“He did appear much disturbed when he read the letter that had brought me into this scrape. He seemed quite overcome by my misfortune.”\n“By your misfortune?”\n“Yes.”\n“Then you feel quite sure that it was your misfortune he deplored?”\n“He gave me one great proof of his sympathy, at any rate.”\n“And that?”\n“He burnt the sole evidence that could at all have criminated me.”\n“What? the accusation?”\n“No; the letter.”\n“Are you sure?”\n“I saw it done.”\n“That alters the case. This man might, after all, be a greater scoundrel than you have thought possible.”\n“Upon my word,” said Dantès, “you make me shudder. Is the world filled with tigers and crocodiles?”\n“Yes; and remember that two-legged tigers and crocodiles are more dangerous than the others.”\n“Never mind; let us go on.”\n“With all my heart! You tell me he burned the letter?”\n“He did; saying at the same time, ‘You see I thus destroy the only proof existing against you.’”\n“This action is somewhat too sublime to be natural.”\n“You think so?”\n“I am sure of it. To whom was this letter addressed?”\n“To M. Noirtier, Rue Coq-Héron, No. 13, Paris.”\n“Now can you conceive of any interest that your heroic deputy could possibly have had in the destruction of that letter?”\n“Why, it is not altogether impossible he might have had, for he made me promise several times never to speak of that letter to anyone, assuring me he so advised me for my own interest; and, more than this, he insisted on my taking a solemn oath never to utter the name mentioned in the address.”\n“Noirtier!” repeated the abbé; “Noirtier!—I knew a person of that name at the court of the Queen of Etruria,—a Noirtier, who had been a Girondin during the Revolution! What was your deputy called?”\n“De Villefort!” The abbé burst into a fit of laughter, while Dantès gazed on him in utter astonishment.\n“What ails you?” said he at length.\n“Do you see that ray of sunlight?”\n“I do.”\n“Well, the whole thing is more clear to me than that sunbeam is to you. Poor fellow! poor young man! And you tell me this magistrate expressed great sympathy and commiseration for you?”\n“He did.”\n“And the worthy man destroyed your compromising letter?”\n“Yes.”\n“And then made you swear never to utter the name of Noirtier?”\n“Yes.”\n“Why, you poor short-sighted simpleton, can you not guess who this Noirtier was, whose very name he was so careful to keep concealed? This Noirtier was his father!”\nHad a thunderbolt fallen at the feet of Dantès, or hell opened its yawning gulf before him, he could not have been more completely transfixed with horror than he was at the sound of these unexpected words. Starting up, he clasped his hands around his head as though to prevent his very brain from bursting, and exclaimed, “His father! his father!”\n“Yes, his father,” replied the abbé; “his right name was Noirtier de Villefort.”\nAt this instant a bright light shot through the mind of Dantès, and cleared up all that had been dark and obscure before. The change that had come over Villefort during the examination, the destruction of the letter, the exacted promise, the almost supplicating tones of the magistrate, who seemed rather to implore mercy than to pronounce punishment,—all returned with a stunning force to his memory. He cried out, and staggered against the wall like a drunken man, then he hurried to the opening that led from the abbé’s cell to his own, and said, “I must be alone, to think over all this.”\nWhen he regained his dungeon, he threw himself on his bed, where the turnkey found him in the evening visit, sitting with fixed gaze and contracted features, dumb and motionless as a statue. During these hours of profound meditation, which to him had seemed only minutes, he had formed a fearful resolution, and bound himself to its fulfilment by a solemn oath.\nDantès was at length roused from his reverie by the voice of Faria, who, having also been visited by his jailer, had come to invite his fellow-sufferer to share his supper. The reputation of being out of his mind, though harmlessly and even amusingly so, had procured for the abbé unusual privileges. He was supplied with bread of a finer, whiter quality than the usual prison fare, and even regaled each Sunday with a small quantity of wine. Now this was a Sunday, and the abbé had come to ask his young companion to share the luxuries with him.\nDantès followed him; his features were no longer contracted, and now wore their usual expression, but there was that in his whole appearance that bespoke one who had come to a fixed and desperate resolve. Faria bent on him his penetrating eye.\n“I regret now,” said he, “having helped you in your late inquiries, or having given you the information I did.”\n“Why so?” inquired Dantès.\n“Because it has instilled a new passion in your heart—that of vengeance.”\nDantès smiled. “Let us talk of something else,” said he.",

Do you call that regular?”\n“No, but that is the custom in France, and especially in Paris, where they think nothing of burying a man alive in the Bastille, the Bicêtre, or the Charenton, as they did with Latude, and many others.”\n“But then the king is deceived?” said Dantès.\n“Certainly he is; but what does that signify to M. de Richelieu or M. de Sartines, who are the ministers?

He was a Girondin, and a very warm partisan of the Revolution. He was a member of the Convention, and voted for the death of the king. He was a very clever man, and a very dangerous one.”\n“And his son?”\n“His son, as you say, was deputy-procureur. He was a very ambitious young man, and a very clever one too. He was very much attached to his father, and very much afraid of him.”\n“And he examined me?”\n“Yes, he examined you. And what did he say?”\n“He asked me my name, my age, my profession, and where I came from. He asked me if I knew M. de Noirtier, and if I had a letter for him.”\n“And you said?”\n“I said that I did not know M. de Noirtier, and that I had a letter for him.”\n“And he read the letter?”\n“Yes, he read it.”\n“And what did he do with it?”\n“He burned it.”\n“He burned it!” exclaimed the abbé. “He burned it before your eyes?”\n“Yes.”\n“And what did he say?”\n“He said that the letter was a very dangerous one, and that it would ruin me if it were found. He said that he would burn it, and that I must promise him never to speak of it again, and never to utter the name of Noirtier.”\n“And you promised him?”\n“Yes.”\n“And you have kept your promise?”\n“Yes, until now.”\n“And you have never spoken of this letter to any one?”\n“Never.”\n“Not even to your father?”\n“No.”\n“Nor to Mercédès?”\n“No.”\n“Nor to Fernand?”\n“No.”\n“Nor to Caderousse?”\n“No.”\n“Nor to Danglars?”\n“No.”\n“Nor to any one?”\n“To no one.”\n“And you have never uttered the name of Noirtier?”\n“Never.”\n“Until now?”\n“Until now.”\n“Good,” said the abbé. “Now I understand. This M. de Villefort was the son of M. de Noirtier.”\n“Yes.”\n“And he was afraid that the letter would compromise his father?”\n“Yes.”\n“And he burned it to save his father?”\n“Yes.”\n“And he made you promise never to speak of it again, and never to utter the name of Noirtier?”\n“Yes.”\n“And he sent you to prison?”\n“Yes.”\n“Without trial, without examination, without sentence?”\n“Yes.”\n“Because he was afraid that you would speak?”\n“Yes.”\n“And he was right,” said the abbé. “You would have spoken.”\n“Yes,” said Dantès, “I would have spoken.”\n“And you would have ruined his father?”\n“Yes.”\n“And he sent you to prison to save his father?”\n“Yes.”\n“And he was right,” repeated the abbé. “He was right.”\n“But he was a scoundrel!” exclaimed Dantès.\n“No,” said the abbé, “he was not a scoundrel. He was a man who loved his father.”\n“But he sacrificed me to his father!”\n“Yes,” said the abbé, “he sacrificed you to his father. But that is not being a scoundrel. That is being a man.”\n“But he was a villain!” cried Dantès.\n“No,” said the abbé, “he was not a villain. He was a man who was afraid.”\n“Afraid of what?”\n“Afraid of the law. Afraid of the guillotine. Afraid of being ruined. Afraid of being dishonored.”\n“But he dishonored me!” cried Dantès.\n“No,” said the abbé, “he did not dishonor you. He saved his father.”\n“But he was a coward!” cried Dantès.\n“No,” said the abbé, “he was not a coward.

Who could possibly gain from my ruin?” The abbé’s smile faded, replaced by an expression of profound pity. “Alas, my son,” he said softly, “it is often those closest to us who have the most to gain from our downfall. Envy, jealousy, ambition – these are powerful motives, capable of turning affection into malice.” He paused, allowing the weight of his words to settle upon the young man. “You asked who gained. Let us consider. Who coveted your position as captain of the *Pharaon*?” Dantès’s eyes widened slightly. “Danglars,” he whispered, the name tasting bitter on his tongue. “Precisely,” the abbé affirmed. “A man consumed by professional jealousy, who saw you as an obstacle to his own advancement. He was the first link in the chain.” “Danglars…” Dantès murmured, shaking his head in disbelief. “But he was my shipmate! We sailed together!” “And who,” the abbé continued, his voice low and steady, “was consumed by jealousy of another kind? Who desired the woman you were to marry, the beautiful Mercédès?” A cold dread began to creep into Dantès’s heart. He knew the answer before the abbé spoke the name. “Fernand,” he breathed, his voice barely audible. “Fernand Mondego.” “The very same,” said the abbé. “Your rival in love, who saw your impending marriage as the end of his hopes. He was the second link.” Dantès buried his face in his hands, a low groan escaping his lips. “Fernand… my friend since childhood… Mercédès’s cousin…” The abbé waited patiently, letting the storm of realization break over him. “And finally,” the abbé said, his tone hardening slightly, “who was the instrument of your destruction? Who, in his zeal to protect his own burgeoning career and conceal a dangerous secret, seized upon the denunciation and ensured it led to your perpetual imprisonment?” Dantès looked up, his eyes red-rimmed and filled with a dawning horror. “The examining magistrate,” he said, his voice hoarse. “Monsieur de Villefort.” “Gérard de Villefort,” the abbé confirmed, his gaze piercing. “The man who sacrificed your life to secure his own future. His father, Noirtier, was a staunch Bonapartist. At a time when the Bourbons were restored, such a connection was ruinous. Your letter, intended for the emperor, was the very evidence he needed to prove his own loyalty to the crown by ruthlessly suppressing any hint of Bonapartist conspiracy. He saw your innocence, he knew the denunciation was born of malice, but he chose to bury you and the secret with you.” Dantès sprang to his feet, pacing the narrow confines of the cell like a caged animal. “Danglars! Fernand! Villefort! All three! They conspired against me! They stole my freedom, my love, my life!” His voice rose to a shout, echoing off the stone walls. “Why? Why did they hate me so much?” “Not hate, my son,” the abbé corrected gently. “Self-interest. Danglars wanted your place. Fernand wanted your bride. Villefort wanted to protect his name and career. You were simply in their way. An inconvenience to be removed.” “An inconvenience!” Dantès cried, his fists clenched. “They condemned me to this living tomb for being an ‘inconvenience’?” He stopped pacing and turned to the abbé, his eyes blazing with a terrible light. “And the letter? How did they do it? How did they ensure it reached Villefort?” The abbé gestured towards the straw pallet. “Sit, my son. Let us examine the mechanics of their treachery. Danglars, as I deduced from your account of the events leading up to your arrest, was the author of the denunciation. He wrote the words that sealed your fate. Fernand, consumed by jealousy, was the one who undertook to deliver it, or ensure its delivery, to the authorities. He was the hand that carried the poison.” “Fernand delivered it?” Dantès repeated, his voice filled with anguish. “My friend… my brother…” “And Villefort,” the abbé continued, ignoring Dantès’s cry of pain, “was the judge, jury, and executioner. He received the letter, recognized its potential to implicate his own family, and instead of investigating its malicious origins, he destroyed it and you along with it. He saw the name ‘Noirtier’ in the address on the letter you carried, and his fate was sealed the moment he read it. He could not let that letter, or you, reach Paris.”"

          "text_segment": "Again the abbé looked at him, then mournfully shook his head; but in accordance with Dantès’ request, he began to speak of other matters. The elder prisoner was one of those persons whose conversation, like that of all who have experienced many trials, contained many useful and important hints as well as sound information; but it was never egotistical, for the unfortunate man never alluded to his own sorrows. Dantès listened with admiring attention to all he said; some of his remarks corresponded with what he already knew, or applied to the sort of knowledge his nautical life had enabled him to acquire. A part of the good abbé’s words, however, were wholly incomprehensible to him; but, like the aurora which guides the navigator in northern latitudes, opened new vistas to the inquiring mind of the listener, and gave fantastic glimpses of new horizons, enabling him justly to estimate the delight an intellectual mind would have in following one so richly gifted as Faria along the heights of truth, where he was so much at home.\n“You must teach me a small part of what you know,” said Dantès, “if only to prevent your growing weary of me. I can well believe that so learned a person as yourself would prefer absolute solitude to being tormented with the company of one as ignorant and uninformed as myself. If you will only agree to my request, I promise you never to mention another word about escaping.”\nThe abbé smiled.\n“Alas, my boy,” said he, “human knowledge is confined within very narrow limits; and when I have taught you mathematics, physics, history, and the three or four modern languages with which I am acquainted, you will know as much as I do myself. Now, it will scarcely require two years for me to communicate to you the stock of learning I possess.”\n“Two years!” exclaimed Dantès; “do you really believe I can acquire all these things in so short a time?”\n“Not their application, certainly, but their principles you may; to learn is not to know; there are the learners and the learned. Memory makes the one, philosophy the other.”\n“But cannot one learn philosophy?”\n“Philosophy cannot be taught; it is the application of the sciences to truth; it is like the golden cloud in which the Messiah went up into heaven.”\n“Well, then,” said Dantès, “What shall you teach me first? I am in a hurry to begin. I want to learn.”\n“Everything,” said the abbé. And that very evening the prisoners sketched a plan of education, to be entered upon the following day. Dantès possessed a prodigious memory, combined with an astonishing quickness and readiness of conception; the mathematical turn of his mind rendered him apt at all kinds of calculation, while his naturally poetical feelings threw a light and pleasing veil over the dry reality of arithmetical computation, or the rigid severity of geometry. He already knew Italian, and had also picked up a little of the Romaic dialect during voyages to the East; and by the aid of these two languages he easily comprehended the construction of all the others, so that at the end of six months he began to speak Spanish, English, and German.\nIn strict accordance with the promise made to the abbé, Dantès spoke no more of escape. Perhaps the delight his studies afforded him left no room for such thoughts; perhaps the recollection that he had pledged his word (on which his sense of honor was keen) kept him from referring in any way to the possibilities of flight. Days, even months, passed by unheeded in one rapid and instructive course. At the end of a year Dantès was a new man.",

He related the history of the illustrious unfortunates who have languished in prison, in chains, or in dungeons. He knew the histories of Pope Alexander VI. and his daughter Lucrezia Borgia; of Pope Clement VII. and the horrible massacre of Rome in 1527, when 28,000 of his people were murdered before his eyes; of the Duke de Guise, who was murdered by forty-five blows of a poniard; of the Chevalier de Saint-Méry, who was slowly tortured to death; of Urbain Grandier, who was burned at the stake with his manuscript; of Galileo, who was imprisoned for astronomical observations from which he recanted publicly, but who whispered, nevertheless, as he rose from his knees, “E pur si muove” (and yet it moves).

He had often heard of the Abbé Faria, and the high estimation in which he was held; but his admiration was greatly increased when he saw the man himself, and was enabled to judge of the vast extent of his acquirements. “You like history, do you not?” asked the abbé. “Oh, yes, very much,” replied Dantès; “you have made me like it better than ever.” “Well, then, I will teach it to you,” said the abbé; “and not only history, but mathematics, physics, and all I know myself, excepting, of course, the art of escaping, which you have already renounced.” Dantès smiled. “I will teach you all this,” continued the abbé, “in about two years.” “Two years!” exclaimed Dantès. “Yes; it is a short time, is it not?” asked the abbé. “I thought it would take ten,” replied Dantès. “Human knowledge is limited,” said Faria; “and when I have taught you mathematics, physics, history, and four or five modern languages, you will know nearly as much as I do. Memory makes learners, while philosophy makes the learned.

Sometimes he would fall into long reveries, sigh heavily and involuntarily, then suddenly rise, and, with folded arms, begin pacing the confined space of his dungeon. One day he stopped all at once, and exclaimed:\n“Ah, if there were no sentinel!”\n“There shall not be one a minute longer than you please,” said Dantès, who had followed the working of his thoughts as accurately as though his brain were enclosed in crystal so clear as to display its minutest operations.\n“I have already told you,” answered the abbé, “that I loathe the idea of shedding blood.”\n“And yet the murder, if you choose to call it so, would be simply a measure of self-preservation.”\n“No matter! I could never agree to it.”\n“Still, you have thought of it?”\n“Incessantly, alas!” cried the abbé.\n“And you have discovered a means of regaining our freedom, have you not?” asked Dantès eagerly.\n“I have; if it were only possible to place a deaf and blind sentinel in the gallery beyond us.”\n“He shall be both blind and deaf,” replied the young man, with an air of determination that made his companion shudder.\n“No, no,” cried the abbé; “impossible!”\nDantès endeavored to renew the subject; the abbé shook his head in token of disapproval, and refused to make any further response. Three months passed away.\n“Are you strong?” the abbé asked one day of Dantès. The young man, in reply, took up the chisel, bent it into the form of a horseshoe, and then as readily straightened it.\n“And will you engage not to do any harm to the sentry, except as a last resort?”\n“I promise on my honor.”\n“Then,” said the abbé, “we may hope to put our design into execution.”\n“And how long shall we be in accomplishing the necessary work?”\n“At least a year.”\n“And shall we begin at once?”\n“At once.”\n“We have lost a year to no purpose!” cried Dantès.\n“Do you consider the last twelve months to have been wasted?” asked the abbé.\n“Forgive me!” cried Edmond, blushing deeply.\n“Tut, tut!” answered the abbé, “man is but man after all, and you are about the best specimen of the genus I have ever known. Come, let me show you my plan.”\nThe abbé then showed Dantès the sketch he had made for their escape. It consisted of a plan of his own cell and that of Dantès, with the passage which united them. In this passage he proposed to drive a level as they do in mines; this level would bring the two prisoners immediately beneath the gallery where the sentry kept watch; once there, a large excavation would be made, and one of the flag-stones with which the gallery was paved be so completely loosened that at the desired moment it would give way beneath the feet of the soldier, who, stunned by his fall, would be immediately bound and gagged by Dantès before he had power to offer any resistance. The prisoners were then to make their way through one of the gallery windows, and to let themselves down from the outer walls by means of the abbé’s ladder of cords.\nDantès’ eyes sparkled with joy, and he rubbed his hands with delight at the idea of a plan so simple, yet apparently so certain to succeed. That very day the miners began their labors, with a vigor and alacrity proportionate to their long rest from fatigue and their hopes of ultimate success. Nothing interrupted the progress of the work except the necessity that each was under of returning to his cell in anticipation of the turnkey’s visits. They had learned to distinguish the almost imperceptible sound of his footsteps as he descended towards their dungeons, and happily, never failed of being prepared for his coming. The fresh earth excavated during their present work, and which would have entirely blocked up the old passage, was thrown, by degrees and with the utmost precaution, out of the window in either Faria’s or Dantès’ cell, the rubbish being first pulverized so finely that the night wind carried it far away without permitting the smallest trace to remain.\nMore than a year had been consumed in this undertaking, the only tools for which had been a chisel, a knife, and a wooden lever; Faria still continuing to instruct Dantès by conversing with him, sometimes in one language, sometimes in another; at others, relating to him the history of nations and great men who from time to time have risen to fame and trodden the path of glory. The abbé was a man of the world, and had, moreover, mixed in the first society of the day; he wore an air of melancholy dignity which Dantès, thanks to the imitative powers bestowed on him by nature, easily acquired, as well as that outward polish and politeness he had before been wanting in, and which is seldom possessed except by those who have been placed in constant intercourse with persons of high birth and breeding.\nAt the end of fifteen months the level was finished, and the excavation completed beneath the gallery, and the two workmen could distinctly hear the measured tread of the sentinel as he paced to and fro over their heads. Compelled, as they were, to await a night sufficiently dark to favor their flight, they were obliged to defer their final attempt till that auspicious moment should arrive; their greatest dread now was lest the stone through which the sentry was doomed to fall should give way before its right time, and this they had in some measure provided against by propping it up with a small beam which they had discovered in the walls through which they had worked their way. Dantès was occupied in arranging this piece of wood when he heard Faria, who had remained in Edmond’s cell for the purpose of cutting a peg to secure their rope-ladder, call to him in a tone indicative of great suffering.",

Sometimes, in the middle of their conversation, he would stop, and his eyes would become fixed and vacant, and then he would heave a deep sigh. Dantès quickly perceived that Faria concealed something from him. One day he ventured to question him on the subject; but the abbé merely shook his head, and replied that the thing he thought of was of too serious a nature to be discussed by mere words. That night Dantès did not sleep. As he had done before he knew the abbé, he remained awake, listening to every sound, and fancying he heard the abbé sighing. The next day, when he went into the abbé’s chamber, he found him sitting with his head bent down, and his whole frame in a state of extreme depression. He did not notice Dantès’ entrance. The latter stood for a moment, hesitating whether to speak to him or not; but, seeing that his presence was unnoticed, and that Faria was so deeply engaged in the subject of his thoughts, he coughed. Faria raised his head, and, with a bitter smile, which was painful to see, held out his hand to Dantès. “As you see, my son,” said he, “the iron has entered into my soul.” Dantès sat down beside him. “It is a sad thing to feel that one’s will is powerless,” continued Faria. “There is one thing of which I am always thinking.” “Tell me what it is,” said Dantès, “and perhaps I may be able to assist you.” The abbé shook his head. “No,” said he, “it is a matter that concerns me alone, and in which no one can assist me.” “Is it anything connected with your escape?” asked Dantès. “Perhaps.” “Can I do anything to forward it?” “Yes; but you must have patience.” “I have patience,” said Dantès. “But tell me what it is.” Faria remained silent for a moment, and then, looking at Dantès with a searching glance, he said, “Edmond, if there were no sentinel!” “Ah,” said Dantès, “I understand you. You think that the sentinel is an insurmountable obstacle.” “He is,” said Faria. “But,” said Dantès, “the sentinel is a man like ourselves.” “Yes,” said Faria, “but he is armed, and we are not.” “But,” said Dantès, “we might disarm him.” “No,” said Faria, “I will not consent to bloodshed.” “But,” said Dantès, “it would be in self-defence.” “No,” said Faria, “I have an aversion to bloodshed.” Dantès was silent. He saw that the abbé was determined on this point. “But,” said Faria, after a moment’s silence, “if we could place a sentinel in the gallery who was deaf and blind, then I should have a plan.” “He shall be both blind and deaf,” replied Dantès, with a determined tone. Faria shuddered. “No,” said he, “I will not hear of it.” And he refused to say another word on the subject. Dantès saw that it was useless to press him further, and he left him. Three months passed away. During this time, Faria seemed to be constantly thinking of the same thing. One day, when Dantès was with him, he said, “Edmond, are you strong?” “I think so,” said Dantès. “Try,” said Faria, holding out a chisel. Dantès took the chisel, and, with a slight effort, bent it. “Good,” said Faria. “Now straighten it.” Dantès straightened the chisel. “You are strong enough,” said Faria. “Now, listen to me. I have a plan. But you must promise me one thing.” “What is it?” asked Dantès. “You must promise me that you will not harm the sentinel, unless it is absolutely necessary for your own preservation.” “I promise,” said Dantès. “Then,” said Faria, “we can execute our design. It will take at least a year.” “A year!” exclaimed Dantès. “Another year lost!” “No,” said Faria, “not lost. You have learned much during the past year.” “But,” said Dantès, “a year is a long time.” “It is,” said Faria, “but we must have patience.” “Tell me your plan,” said Dantès. “Listen,” said Faria. “We will dig a tunnel from the passage that connects our cells, and extend it beneath the gallery where the sentinel walks. We will then excavate the earth beneath one of the flagstones of the gallery, so that it will give way when the sentinel steps upon it. He will fall, and be stunned. You will then rush out, bind and gag him, and we will escape through the window of the gallery, using my ladder.” Dantès listened with intense interest. The plan was so simple, and yet so promising, that he could scarcely believe it. “And the sentinel?” he asked. “We will take his clothes, and leave him bound and gagged in the tunnel,” said Faria. “He will be found in the morning, and it will be supposed that he has been attacked by some of the prisoners.” “It is a bold plan,” said Dantès. “It is the only one that offers any chance of success,” said Faria. “Are you willing to undertake it?” “I am,” said Dantès. “Then,” said Faria, “let us begin at once.” They set to work immediately. Their labor was severe, but they worked with renewed vigor and hope. They dug the tunnel, and excavated the earth beneath the gallery. They were obliged to work in the greatest secrecy, and to return to their cells whenever they heard the footsteps of the turnkeys. They soon learned to distinguish the footsteps of each turnkey, and to know when they were approaching. They pulverized the excavated earth, and threw it out of their windows at night. More than a year was consumed in this undertaking. They had only a chisel, a knife, and a wooden lever to work with. During all this time, Faria continued to instruct Dantès in various languages, and in history, geography, and mathematics. He also taught him much concerning the manners and customs of different countries, and the laws and institutions of different governments. He imparted to him all the knowledge he had acquired during his long and studious life. Dantès made rapid progress, and became a man of extensive information and refined manners. After fifteen months, the tunnel and the excavation beneath the gallery were completed. They could hear the sentinel pacing above their heads. They now only awaited a sufficiently dark night for their attempt. Their principal fear was that the loosened stone might give way prematurely. To prevent this, they supported it with a small wooden beam. One day, as Dantès was arranging this beam, Faria, who was in Edmond’s cell cutting a peg for the ladder, called out in a tone of great suffering.",

                "text": "Dantès observed, however, that Faria, in spite of the relief his society afforded, daily grew sadder; one thought seemed incessantly to harass and distract his mind. Sometimes, in the middle of their conversation, he would stop, and his eyes would become fixed and vacant, and then he would heave a deep sigh. Dantès quickly perceived that Faria concealed something from him. One day he ventured to question him on the subject; but the abbé merely shook his head, and replied that the thing he thought of was of too serious a nature to be discussed by mere words. That night Dantès did not sleep. As he had done before he knew the abbé, he remained awake, listening to every sound, and fancying he heard the abbé sighing. The next day, when he went into the abbé’s chamber, he found him sitting with his head bent down, and his whole frame in a state of extreme depression. He did not notice Dantès’ entrance. The latter stood for a moment, hesitating whether to speak to him or not; but, seeing that his presence was unnoticed, and that Faria was so deeply engaged in the subject of his thoughts, he coughed. Faria raised his head, and, with a bitter smile, which was painful to see, held out his hand to Dantès. “As you see, my son,” said he, “the iron has entered into my soul.” Dantès sat down beside him. “It is a sad thing to feel that one’s will is powerless,” continued Faria. “There is one thing of which I am always thinking.” “Tell me what it is,” said Dantès, “and perhaps I may be able to assist you.” The abbé shook his head. “No,” said he, “it is a matter that concerns me alone, and in which no one can assist me.” “Is it anything connected with your escape?” asked Dantès. “Perhaps.” “Can I do anything to forward it?” “Yes; but you must have patience.” “I have patience,” said Dantès. “But tell me what it is.” Faria remained silent for a moment, and then, looking at Dantès with a searching glance, he said, “Edmond, if there were no sentinel!” “Ah,” said Dantès, “I understand you. You think that the sentinel is an insurmountable obstacle.” “He is,” said Faria. “But,” said Dantès, “the sentinel is a man like ourselves.” “Yes,” said Faria, “but he is armed, and we are not.” “But,” said Dantès, “we might disarm him.” “No,” said Faria, “I will not consent to bloodshed.” “But,” said Dantès, “it would be in self-defence.” “No,” said Faria, “I have an aversion to bloodshed.” Dantès was silent. He saw that the abbé was determined on this point. “But,” said Faria, after a moment’s silence, “if we could place a sentinel in the gallery who was deaf and blind, then I should have a plan.” “He shall be both blind and deaf,” replied Dantès, with a determined tone. Faria shuddered. “No,” said he, “I will not hear of it.” And he refused to say another word on the subject. Dantès saw that it was useless to press him further, and he left him. Three months passed away. During this time, Faria seemed to be constantly thinking of the same thing. One day, when Dantès was with him, he said, “Edmond, are you strong?” “I think so,” said Dantès. “Try,” said Faria, holding out a chisel. Dantès took the chisel, and, with a slight effort, bent it. “Good,” said Faria. “Now straighten it.” Dantès straightened the chisel. “You are strong enough,” said Faria. “Now, listen to me. I have a plan. But you must promise me one thing.” “What is it?” asked Dantès. “You must promise me that you will not harm the sentinel, unless it is absolutely necessary for your own preservation.” “I promise,” said Dantès. “Then,” said Faria, “we can execute our design.

            "prefix-probing": "Dantès observed, however, that Faria, in spite of the relief his society afforded, daily grew sadder; one thought seemed incessantly to harass and distract his mind. It was evident that some secret sorrow, deeper than the loss of liberty, gnawed at his heart. Dantès, who had come to regard the old man with filial affection, could not bear to see him thus afflicted. He ventured, one day, to question him gently on the subject.\n\n“My dear Abbé,” he said, “you have taught me so much, given me so much hope and strength. Yet, I see you are troubled. Is there something I can do? Some burden I can share?”\n\nFaria sighed, a deep, weary sound that seemed to come from the very depths of his soul. He looked at Dantès with eyes that held a profound sadness, yet also a flicker of something else – a strange, feverish light.\n\n“Ah, my son,” he replied, his voice low and hesitant, “you are kind, too kind. But this is a burden I have carried for many years, and it is one that grows heavier with each passing day of my captivity.”\n\n“But what is it?” Dantès pressed, his concern growing. “Is it your past? Your enemies? The injustice of your imprisonment?”\n\n“All that, yes,” Faria admitted, “but there is something more. A secret. A terrible, magnificent secret that consumes me.”\n\nHe paused, as if weighing whether to speak further. Dantès waited patiently, his heart pounding with a mixture of curiosity and apprehension.\n\nFinally, Faria seemed to make a decision. He leaned closer, his voice dropping to a conspiratorial whisper, though there was no one to overhear them but the rats and the echoes of the dungeon.\n\n“Dantès,” he began, “you know that I was once the secretary and friend of Cardinal Spada?”\n\n“You have told me, Abbé.”\n\n“And you know that Cardinal Spada was one of the wealthiest and most powerful princes of the Church in his time?”\n\n“Yes.”\n\n“What you do not know,” Faria continued, his eyes fixed on Dantès, “is the source of that immense wealth. It was not entirely derived from his benefices or his family’s ancient fortune. Much of it came from a hidden source, a treasure.”\n\nDantès stared, half-disbelieving. “A treasure?”\n\n“Yes, a treasure,” Faria affirmed, his voice gaining a strange intensity. “Hidden by one of his ancestors, a man named Cesare Spada, in the year 1498. Cesare, fearing that Pope Alexander VI and his son Cesare Borgia would confiscate his vast riches, decided to conceal them.”\n\nFaria then recounted how, upon the death of Cardinal Spada, his library and possessions had passed through several hands before being acquired by Cardinal Rospigliosi, in whose service Faria had been. It was while cataloguing the old cardinal’s library that Faria made his astonishing discovery.\n\n“Among the books,” Faria explained, his eyes gleaming with the memory, “was an old breviary. It seemed unremarkable, but as I examined it closely, I noticed that some pages were stuck together. With great care, I separated them, and there, between the leaves, I found a piece of paper. It was yellowed with age, written in a cipher.”\n\nFaria described the painstaking process of deciphering the code, a task that took him months of patient work. He had suspected it might be a political document or a family secret, but the reality was far more extraordinary.\n\n“The message,” Faria said, his voice trembling slightly, “was a will. Not a legal will, but a testament from Cesare Spada to his descendants, revealing the location of his hidden fortune. It read: ‘I, Cesare Spada, having been warned that Pope Alexander VI is about to poison me, and fearing that my property will be confiscated by the Borgias, declare that I have hidden in the island of Monte Cristo, in the most remote cave, all my treasures, consisting of two million Roman crowns in gold and silver ingots, and a vast collection of jewels and precious stones"

I am seized with a terrible, perhaps mortal illness; I can feel that the paroxysm is fast approaching. I had a similar attack the year previous to my imprisonment. This malady admits but of one remedy; I will tell you what that is. Go into my cell as quickly as you can; draw out one of the feet that support the bed; you will find it has been hollowed out for the purpose of containing a small phial you will see there half-filled with a red-looking fluid. Bring it to me—or rather—no, no!—I may be found here, therefore help me back to my room while I have the strength to drag myself along. Who knows what may happen, or how long the attack may last?”\nIn spite of the magnitude of the misfortune which thus suddenly frustrated his hopes, Dantès did not lose his presence of mind, but descended into the passage, dragging his unfortunate companion with him; then, half-carrying, half-supporting him, he managed to reach the abbé’s chamber, when he immediately laid the sufferer on his bed.\n“Thanks,” said the poor abbé, shivering as though his veins were filled with ice. “I am about to be seized with a fit of catalepsy; when it comes to its height I shall probably lie still and motionless as though dead, uttering neither sigh nor groan. On the other hand, the symptoms may be much more violent, and cause me to fall into fearful convulsions, foam at the mouth, and cry out loudly. Take care my cries are not heard, for if they are it is more than probable I should be removed to another part of the prison, and we be separated forever. When I become quite motionless, cold, and rigid as a corpse, then, and not before,—be careful about this,—force open my teeth with the knife, pour from eight to ten drops of the liquor contained in the phial down my throat, and I may perhaps revive.”\n“Perhaps!” exclaimed Dantès in grief-stricken tones.\n“Help! help!” cried the abbé, “I—I—die—I——”\nSo sudden and violent was the fit that the unfortunate prisoner was unable to complete the sentence; a violent convulsion shook his whole frame, his eyes started from their sockets, his mouth was drawn on one side, his cheeks became purple, he struggled, foamed, dashed himself about, and uttered the most dreadful cries, which, however, Dantès prevented from being heard by covering his head with the blanket. The fit lasted two hours; then, more helpless than an infant, and colder and paler than marble, more crushed and broken than a reed trampled under foot, he fell back, doubled up in one last convulsion, and became as rigid as a corpse.\nEdmond waited till life seemed extinct in the body of his friend, then, taking up the knife, he with difficulty forced open the closely fixed jaws, carefully administered the appointed number of drops, and anxiously awaited the result. An hour passed away and the old man gave no sign of returning animation. Dantès began to fear he had delayed too long ere he administered the remedy, and, thrusting his hands into his hair, continued gazing on the lifeless features of his friend. At length a slight color tinged the livid cheeks, consciousness returned to the dull, open eyeballs, a faint sigh issued from the lips, and the sufferer made a feeble effort to move.\n“He is saved! he is saved!” cried Dantès in a paroxysm of delight.\nThe sick man was not yet able to speak, but he pointed with evident anxiety towards the door. Dantès listened, and plainly distinguished the approaching steps of the jailer. It was therefore near seven o’clock; but Edmond’s anxiety had put all thoughts of time out of his head.\nThe young man sprang to the entrance, darted through it, carefully drawing the stone over the opening, and hurried to his cell. He had scarcely done so before the door opened, and the jailer saw the prisoner seated as usual on the side of his bed. Almost before the key had turned in the lock, and before the departing steps of the jailer had died away in the long corridor he had to traverse, Dantès, whose restless anxiety concerning his friend left him no desire to touch the food brought him, hurried back to the abbé’s chamber, and raising the stone by pressing his head against it, was soon beside the sick man’s couch. Faria had now fully regained his consciousness, but he still lay helpless and exhausted on his miserable bed.",

What is this? Is it the same illness?\" \"The same, and yet more terrible; and if God does not permit me to find a remedy, I cannot long survive it.\" \"A remedy!\" exclaimed Dantès; \"has this illness, then, a remedy?\" \"Yes, a remedy; a single one, a sovereign one; a remedy that has saved me when I have been ten times as ill as I am now; and if I had it by my side, I should be saved in ten minutes.\" \"A remedy! and you have not this remedy?\" cried Dantès in despair. \"No, for I have lost it. The attack seized me when I was in the act of removing my bed to pass into your chamber; and I had not time to get my phial.\" \"A phial! is your remedy, then, contained in a phial?\" \"Yes,\" answered the abbé, \"in a small phial, of the kind you use for smelling-salts, of which I always have two or three about me.\" \"And where is this phial?\" \"I have it not, I tell you; it is in my chamber, in the pocket of my frock, which is hanging on the wall.\" \"Quick! quick!\" cried Dantès; \"tell me what is to be done.\" \"You must go to my chamber,\" said the abbé; \"take my frock from the wall, pass your hand into the pocket, and you will find the phial I spoke of; bring it to me, and if I have strength enough left to open it, or if you do it for me, and pour ten drops in a glass, I shall be saved.\" \"But go to your chamber!\" said Dantès; \"how can I? The passage is blocked up.\" \"It is not,\" cried Faria; \"I removed the stones before I was attacked.\" \"Oh, why did you not call me? why did you not call me?\" cried Dantès. \"A fit of giddiness came over me, and when it passed, I had scarcely strength to drag myself to the opening.

Make haste!\" Dantès waited not for a second bidding; he sprang into the passage, and in a moment arrived at the opening; the stones were removed, and the passage was free. He entered the abbé's chamber, went straight to the wall, and felt the frock; the phial was there. He seized it, and returned with the speed of lightning. He found the abbé in the same position, but his face was fearfully pale, and his features convulsed. \"You are saved! you are saved!\" cried Dantès, holding up the phial. \"Give it to me! give it to me!\" cried the abbé. \"Quick! quick!\" He seized the phial with a convulsive hand, raised it to his lips, and swallowed the contents. \"It is past!\" said he, falling back on his bed; \"I am saved!\" Dantès saw that he was indeed saved; the color returned to his cheeks, his eyes lost their wild expression, and he spoke with a firm voice. \"But,\" said Dantès, \"what was this terrible illness?\" \"It is a catalepsy,\" answered the abbé; \"it is an attack that seizes me at intervals; it is a kind of lethargy, during which I lie as if dead, without sense or motion. I have been subject to it from my youth; it is a hereditary disease, and my father died of it.\" \"And this remedy?\" \"It is a powerful stimulant, which restores me to life. I have always a supply of it about me, and it is the only thing that can save me.\" \"But,\" said Dantès, \"if you had not been able to remove the stones, and I had not been able to come to you?\" \"Then I should have died,\" answered the abbé. \"But God has willed it otherwise, and he has sent you to save me.\" Dantès remained with the abbé all night; he watched over him with the tenderness of a son, and the abbé, who had recovered his strength, conversed with him on the subject of his illness. \"This attack,\" said he, \"is a warning from God; it tells me that I have not long to live. I must therefore make haste to communicate to you the secret I have so long guarded.\" \"Oh, my dear friend,\" said Dantès, \"do not speak of dying; you will live, and we shall be free.\" \"No,\" said the abbé, \"my hour is come; I feel it.

I have always a supply of it about me, and it is the only thing that can save me.\" \"But,\" said Dantès, \"if you had not been able to remove the stones, and I had not been able to come to you?\" \"Then I should have died,\" answered the abbé. \"But God has willed it otherwise, and he has sent you to save me.\" Dantès remained with the abbé all night; he watched over him with the tenderness of a son, and the abbé, who had recovered his strength, conversed with him on the subject of his illness. \"This attack,\" said he, \"is a warning from God; it tells me that I have not long to live. I must therefore make haste to communicate to you the secret I have so long guarded.\" \"Oh, my dear friend,\" said Dantès, \"do not speak of dying; you will live, and we shall be free.\" \"No,\" said the abbé, \"my hour is come; I feel it. But I will not die without revealing to you the secret of the treasure of the Spada family.\"",

          "text_segment": "I did not expect to see you again,” said he feebly, to Dantès.\n“And why not?” asked the young man. “Did you fancy yourself dying?”\n“No, I had no such idea; but, knowing that all was ready for flight, I thought you might have made your escape.”\nThe deep glow of indignation suffused the cheeks of Dantès.\n“Without you? Did you really think me capable of that?”\n“At least,” said the abbé, “I now see how wrong such an opinion would have been. Alas, alas! I am fearfully exhausted and debilitated by this attack.”\n“Be of good cheer,” replied Dantès; “your strength will return.” And as he spoke he seated himself near the bed beside Faria, and took his hands. The abbé shook his head.\n“The last attack I had,” said he, “lasted but half an hour, and after it I was hungry, and got up without help; now I can move neither my right arm nor leg, and my head seems uncomfortable, which shows that there has been a suffusion of blood on the brain. The third attack will either carry me off, or leave me paralyzed for life.”\n“No, no,” cried Dantès; “you are mistaken—you will not die! And your third attack (if, indeed, you should have another) will find you at liberty. We shall save you another time, as we have done this, only with a better chance of success, because we shall be able to command every requisite assistance.”\n“My good Edmond,” answered the abbé, “be not deceived. The attack which has just passed away, condemns me forever to the walls of a prison. None can fly from a dungeon who cannot walk.”\n“Well, we will wait,—a week, a month, two months, if need be,—and meanwhile your strength will return. Everything is in readiness for our flight, and we can select any time we choose. As soon as you feel able to swim we will go.”\n“I shall never swim again,” replied Faria. “This arm is paralyzed; not for a time, but forever. Lift it, and judge if I am mistaken.”\nThe young man raised the arm, which fell back by its own weight, perfectly inanimate and helpless. A sigh escaped him.\n“You are convinced now, Edmond, are you not?” asked the abbé. “Depend upon it, I know what I say. Since the first attack I experienced of this malady, I have continually reflected on it. Indeed, I expected it, for it is a family inheritance; both my father and grandfather died of it in a third attack. The physician who prepared for me the remedy I have twice successfully taken, was no other than the celebrated Cabanis, and he predicted a similar end for me.”\n“The physician may be mistaken!” exclaimed Dantès. “And as for your poor arm, what difference will that make? I can take you on my shoulders, and swim for both of us.”\n“My son,” said the abbé, “you, who are a sailor and a swimmer, must know as well as I do that a man so loaded would sink before he had done fifty strokes. Cease, then, to allow yourself to be duped by vain hopes, that even your own excellent heart refuses to believe in. Here I shall remain till the hour of my deliverance arrives, and that, in all human probability, will be the hour of my death. As for you, who are young and active, delay not on my account, but fly—go—I give you back your promise.”\n“It is well,” said Dantès. “Then I shall also remain.” Then, rising and extending his hand with an air of solemnity over the old man’s head, he slowly added, “By the blood of Christ I swear never to leave you while you live.”\nFaria gazed fondly on his noble-minded, single-hearted, high-principled young friend, and read in his countenance ample confirmation of the sincerity of his devotion and the loyalty of his purpose.\n“Thanks,” murmured the invalid, extending one hand. “I accept. You may one of these days reap the reward of your disinterested devotion. But as I cannot, and you will not, quit this place, it becomes necessary to fill up the excavation beneath the soldier’s gallery; he might, by chance, hear the hollow sound of his footsteps, and call the attention of his officer to the circumstance. That would bring about a discovery which would inevitably lead to our being separated. Go, then, and set about this work, in which, unhappily, I can offer you no assistance; keep at it all night, if necessary, and do not return here tomorrow till after the jailer has visited me. I shall have something of the greatest importance to communicate to you.”\nDantès took the hand of the abbé in his, and affectionately pressed it. Faria smiled encouragingly on him, and the young man retired to his task, in the spirit of obedience and respect which he had sworn to show towards his aged friend.",

We are free, and we have youth on our side.”\n“Alas,” said Faria, “my dear friend, it is not youth that can save me; it is the physician. I feel that all is over.

You are young, and have hitherto been happy; stay not with me, a poor, paralytic, and despairing old man, with whom the jailer will leave you to die of hunger, or will perhaps think proper to bury you alive.

You are young, active, and strong, and you have the world before you.”\n“But what will become of you?”\n“What matters it? If I die here, I shall at least die in your arms.

No, no; I tell you again, fly, and leave me to my fate.”\n“It is in vain,” said Edmond. “I have sworn to remain with you, and I will keep my oath. If you die, I will die with you.

My father and my grandfather died of the same disease, and the physician Cabanis, who attended them, told me that I should probably die of it also, and that the third attack would be fatal. So you see, my dear friend, there is no hope for me.”\n“But we will escape,” said Edmond, with a feverish energy. “We will escape, and we will find a physician who will cure you.”\n“It is impossible,” said the abbé. “I can no longer move my right arm or my right leg. I am paralyzed on one side. How can I escape?”\n“I will carry you,” said Edmond.\n“You cannot. The passage is too narrow, and you are not strong enough.”\n“But I will try.”\n“It is useless, I tell you. Do not deceive yourself with false hopes. Fly, fly alone, and leave me to die in peace.”\n“No,” said Edmond, firmly. “I will not leave you. I will stay with you, and I will take care of you.”\n“Then,” said the abbé, “since you are determined to remain, we must fill up the excavation under the gallery.

His eyes, usually so bright with the fire of intellect, were dimmed and sunken, fixed upon Dantès with a look of profound weariness, yet tinged with a flicker of recognition and perhaps, relief. Dantès rushed to his side, kneeling beside the pallet of straw that served as the old man’s bed. “Abbé! You are ill! What has happened?” he cried, his heart constricting with fear. He had grown to love this extraordinary man, his mentor, his only companion in this living tomb. Faria smiled faintly, a mere ghost of his former vibrant expression. “Nothing, my son, that time and this accursed place do not inflict upon us all. Another attack, that is all. They grow more frequent now, and each one leaves me weaker than the last. I feel the sands running low in the hourglass.” He coughed, a dry, rattling sound that shook his frail frame. Dantès gently raised his head, offering him a little water from the earthen jug. Faria drank slowly, his hand trembling. “Thank you, Edmond,” he murmured. “You are a good son. I regret that I shall not see you free, that I shall not see you enjoy the fruits of my long labour.” Dantès’s brow furrowed. “Do not speak so, Abbé! You will recover, you must! We will escape together, as we planned.” Faria shook his head almost imperceptibly. “No, my boy. My body is failing. The mind remains, sharp as ever, but the vessel is broken. My work is almost done, but it is for you to complete it.” He paused, gathering his strength. “Listen carefully, Edmond. There is little time. I have taught you all I know – languages, history, science, philosophy. I have armed your mind. Now, I must give you the key to unlock your future, the means to execute the justice you"

          "text_segment": "When Dantès returned next morning to the chamber of his companion in captivity, he found Faria seated and looking composed. In the ray of light which entered by the narrow window of his cell, he held open in his left hand, of which alone, it will be recollected, he retained the use, a sheet of paper, which, from being constantly rolled into a small compass, had the form of a cylinder, and was not easily kept open. He did not speak, but showed the paper to Dantès.\n“What is that?” he inquired.\n“Look at it,” said the abbé with a smile.\n“I have looked at it with all possible attention,” said Dantès, “and I only see a half-burnt paper, on which are traces of Gothic characters inscribed with a peculiar kind of ink.”\n“This paper, my friend,” said Faria, “I may now avow to you, since I have the proof of your fidelity—this paper is my treasure, of which, from this day forth, one-half belongs to you.”\nThe sweat started forth on Dantès’ brow. Until this day and for how long a time!—he had refrained from talking of the treasure, which had brought upon the abbé the accusation of madness. With his instinctive delicacy Edmond had preferred avoiding any touch on this painful chord, and Faria had been equally silent. He had taken the silence of the old man for a return to reason; and now these few words uttered by Faria, after so painful a crisis, seemed to indicate a serious relapse into mental alienation.\n“Your treasure?” stammered Dantès. Faria smiled.\n“Yes,” said he. “You have, indeed, a noble nature, Edmond, and I see by your paleness and agitation what is passing in your heart at this moment. No, be assured, I am not mad. This treasure exists, Dantès, and if I have not been allowed to possess it, you will. Yes—you. No one would listen or believe me, because everyone thought me mad; but you, who must know that I am not, listen to me, and believe me so afterwards if you will.”\n“Alas,” murmured Edmond to himself, “this is a terrible relapse! There was only this blow wanting.” Then he said aloud, “My dear friend, your attack has, perhaps, fatigued you; had you not better repose awhile? Tomorrow, if you will, I will hear your narrative; but today I wish to nurse you carefully. Besides,” he said, “a treasure is not a thing we need hurry about.”\n“On the contrary, it is a matter of the utmost importance, Edmond!” replied the old man. “Who knows if tomorrow, or the next day after, the third attack may not come on? and then must not all be over? Yes, indeed, I have often thought with a bitter joy that these riches, which would make the wealth of a dozen families, will be forever lost to those men who persecute me. This idea was one of vengeance to me, and I tasted it slowly in the night of my dungeon and the despair of my captivity. But now I have forgiven the world for the love of you; now that I see you, young and with a promising future,—now that I think of all that may result to you in the good fortune of such a disclosure, I shudder at any delay, and tremble lest I should not assure to one as worthy as yourself the possession of so vast an amount of hidden wealth.”\nEdmond turned away his head with a sigh.\n“You persist in your incredulity, Edmond,” continued Faria. “My words have not convinced you. I see you require proofs. Well, then, read this paper, which I have never shown to anyone.”\n“Tomorrow, my dear friend,” said Edmond, desirous of not yielding to the old man’s madness. “I thought it was understood that we should not talk of that until tomorrow.”\n“Then we will not talk of it until tomorrow; but read this paper today.”\n“I will not irritate him,” thought Edmond, and taking the paper, of which half was wanting,—having been burnt, no doubt, by some accident,—he read:\n“this treasure, which may amount to two...\nof Roman crowns in the most distant a...\nof the second opening wh...\ndeclare to belong to him alo...\nheir.\n                    “25th April, 149’”\n“Well!” said Faria, when the young man had finished reading it.\n“Why,” replied Dantès, “I see nothing but broken lines and unconnected words, which are rendered illegible by fire.”\n“Yes, to you, my friend, who read them for the first time; but not for me, who have grown pale over them by many nights’ study, and have reconstructed every phrase, completed every thought.”\n“And do you believe you have discovered the hidden meaning?”\n“I am sure I have, and you shall judge for yourself; but first listen to the history of this paper.”\n“Silence!” exclaimed Dantès. “Steps approach—I go—adieu!”\nAnd Dantès, happy to escape the history and explanation which would be sure to confirm his belief in his friend’s mental instability, glided like a snake along the narrow passage; while Faria, restored by his alarm to a certain amount of activity, pushed the stone into place with his foot, and covered it with a mat in order the more effectually to avoid discovery.",

In his left hand he held a sheet of paper, which he was carefully examining. ‘Look,’ said he to Dantès, ‘I have found it.’ Dantès took the paper, which was covered with Gothic writing, and over which a thick line had been traced. ‘This paper,’ said Faria, ‘I found in a portfolio I inherited from my great-uncle, the Abbé Faria, who lived in the time of Cæsar Borgia, and who was chaplain to Pope Alexander VI. This portfolio has been in the family from that period. It was not till the other day that I thought of examining the papers it contained, when I discovered this.’ ‘And what is this?’ asked Dantès. ‘Read it,’ replied Faria. ‘It is difficult to read, the writing is so old,’ said Dantès. ‘I have studied it so long that I know it by heart,’ said Faria. ‘I will assist you. That first line is in Latin, and means, “Seek in the fifth of the grottos of the island of Monte Cristo.”’ ‘What island is that?’ asked Dantès. ‘The island of Monte Cristo, near Pianosa,’ replied Faria, ‘a desert island, which has been uninhabited since the time of the pirates. It is there that the Cardinal Spada concealed his treasure, and I have no doubt that this is the paper which will enable you to discover it.’ ‘And what is this treasure?’ asked Dantès. ‘A treasure of two millions of Roman crowns, which are worth nearly thirteen millions of our money,’ replied Faria. ‘And this paper?’ asked Dantès. ‘This paper,’ said Faria, ‘is a will made by the Cardinal Spada, who, fearing that Cæsar Borgia would seize his wealth, concealed it in the island of Monte Cristo, and left this paper to his family, that they might be able to find it after his death. But the paper was lost, and the treasure remained concealed. It was not till the other day that I found this paper, and I have no doubt that it is the one which will enable you to discover the treasure.’ Dantès was struck with astonishment. He had often heard of the immense wealth of the Cardinal Spada, but he had never believed that it was still in existence. ‘And you say that this paper will enable me to discover it?’ asked he. ‘Yes,’ replied Faria, ‘if you follow the directions it contains. But it is necessary that you should be able to read it, and it is written in a cipher which is very difficult to understand.’ ‘But you have understood it?’ said Dantès. ‘Yes,’ replied Faria, ‘after studying it for many years. And I have no doubt that I have discovered the secret.’ ‘And you say that this treasure is worth thirteen millions?’ asked Dantès. ‘Yes,’ replied Faria, ‘and it is all in gold and jewels.’ Dantès was lost in thought. He had often dreamed of wealth, but he had never imagined that it was possible to acquire such a sum. ‘And you say that this paper belongs to you?’ asked he. ‘Yes,’ replied Faria, ‘it belongs to me, and I give it to you.’ ‘To me?’ cried Dantès. ‘Yes, to you,’ replied Faria. ‘You have been a faithful companion to me, and I wish to give you a proof of my gratitude.’ ‘But why do you give it to me?’ asked Dantès. ‘Because,’ replied Faria, ‘I have no need of it. I am old and infirm, and I have not long to live. And I wish to give you a proof of my affection.’ ‘But why do you not keep it for yourself?’ asked Dantès. ‘Because,’ replied Faria, ‘I have no family, and I wish to give it to you, who are like a son to me.’ ‘But why do you not give it to your family?’ asked Dantès. ‘Because,’ replied Faria, ‘I have no family, and I wish to give it to you, who are like a son to me.’ Dantès was deeply moved. He had never expected such a proof of affection from his companion. ‘But why do you not keep it for yourself?’ asked he. ‘Because,’ replied Faria, ‘I have no family, and I wish to give it to you, who are like a son to me.’ Dantès was deeply moved.

                "text": "When Dantès returned next morning to the chamber of his companion in captivity, he found Faria seated and looking composed. In his left hand he held a sheet of paper, which he was carefully examining. ‘Look,’ said he to Dantès, ‘I have found it.’ Dantès took the paper, which was covered with Gothic writing, and over which a thick line had been traced. ‘This paper,’ said Faria, ‘I found in a portfolio I inherited from my great-uncle, the Abbé Faria, who lived in the time of Cæsar Borgia, and who was chaplain to Pope Alexander VI. This portfolio has been in the family from that period. It was not till the other day that I thought of examining the papers it contained, when I discovered this.’ ‘And what is this?’ asked Dantès. ‘Read it,’ replied Faria. ‘It is difficult to read, the writing is so old,’ said Dantès. ‘I have studied it so long that I know it by heart,’ said Faria. ‘I will assist you. That first line is in Latin, and means, “Seek in the fifth of the grottos of the island of Monte Cristo.”’ ‘What island is that?’ asked Dantès. ‘The island of Monte Cristo, near Pianosa,’ replied Faria, ‘a desert island, which has been uninhabited since the time of the pirates. It is there that the Cardinal Spada concealed his treasure, and I have no doubt that this is the paper which will enable you to discover it.’ ‘And what is this treasure?’ asked Dantès. ‘A treasure of two millions of Roman crowns, which are worth nearly thirteen millions of our money,’ replied Faria. ‘And this paper?’ asked Dantès. ‘This paper,’ said Faria, ‘is a will made by the Cardinal Spada, who, fearing that Cæsar Borgia would seize his wealth, concealed it in the island of Monte Cristo, and left this paper to his family, that they might be able to find it after his death.

            "prefix-probing": "When Dantès returned next morning to the chamber of his companion in captivity, he found Faria seated and looking composed. Dantès, on the other hand, was overwhelmed with shame and disappointment. His face was pale, his eyes downcast, and his movements slow and heavy. He felt like a child who had boasted of a great feat only to fail miserably in the attempt. The brief flicker of hope that had sustained him through the arduous night had been brutally extinguished, leaving behind only the cold, hard reality of his prison walls, thicker and more impenetrable than he had ever imagined.\n\nHe sank onto his stool, unable to meet the old man's gaze. He expected reproach, perhaps even pity, which would have been almost as unbearable. But Faria said nothing for a moment, merely observing him with a gentle, understanding expression. The silence stretched, filled only by the distant sounds of the fortress and the quiet rustling of Faria's papers.\n\nFinally, Faria spoke, his voice calm and steady, devoid of any trace of judgment. \"So,\" he said softly, \"you have learned that stone is harder than hope?\" His tone was not mocking, but rather that of someone who had long ago come to terms with such harsh lessons.\n\nDantès winced. \"It was useless, Abbé,\" he murmured, his voice thick with despair. \"All that work... all that hope... for nothing. The wall... it is too thick. I dug for hours, and made scarcely any impression. It is impossible. We are buried alive.\"\n\nFaria nodded slowly. \"Impossible is a word invented by those who find it easier to live in the world as it is given to them, rather than explore the power they have to change it. However,\" he added, a faint smile touching his lips, \"even the greatest power has its limits. You encountered one such limit last night. The rock of the Château d'If is renowned for its density and depth. It is not merely a wall, but the very foundation of the island itself, plunging deep into the sea.\"\n\n\"Then there is no hope,\" Dantès said, the words a bitter taste in his mouth.\n\n\"Hope is a different matter,\" Faria replied. \"Hope is the sun that warms us, the light that guides us. It is not a tool for breaking stone. You confused the desire for freedom with the means to achieve it. Your hope was valid, Edmond, but your method, while brave and determined, was insufficient against such an obstacle. You attacked the mountain with a pickaxe, when perhaps a different approach is needed.\"\n\nDantès looked up, a flicker of curiosity piercing his gloom. \"A different approach? What other approach can there be? We are in a dungeon, Abbé, with only these tools and our hands.\"\n\nFaria leaned forward slightly. \"Knowledge, Edmond. Knowledge is the most powerful tool of all. You have strength, courage, and determination. These are admirable qualities, but they must be guided by understanding. You attempted to overcome a physical barrier with physical force alone. But perhaps the barrier is not solely physical. Perhaps there are other ways around it, or through it, that do not involve brute strength.\"\n\nDantès listened intently, his despair momentarily forgotten in the face of Faria's quiet confidence. \"What do you mean?\" he asked.\n\n\"I mean that every problem has multiple solutions,\" Faria explained. \"And the best solution is often not the most obvious one. You have learned the limits of one path. Now, we must consider others. Your attempt was not a failure, Edmond. It was a valuable experiment. It taught us the nature of the obstacle. Now we know precisely what we are up against. This knowledge is power.\"\n\nHe paused, allowing his words to sink in. Dantès felt a faint stirring within him, a tiny ember of the hope that had been so cruelly extinguished. Faria was not dismissing his pain or his effort; he was reframing the experience, turning a crushing defeat into a lesson learned.\n\n\"But what other way is there?\" Dantès repeated, still struggling to grasp the concept.\n\n\"That is what we must discover"

He spoke a few perfunctory words, asking about the symptoms, his gaze sweeping over the meager furnishings and the prisoner himself with a practiced, detached air. Faria, with difficulty, articulated his condition, his voice weak but retaining a flicker of his former intellect. The governor listened, nodded, and then, after a brief, clinical examination of the afflicted limb, straightened up. There was no real hope offered, only a promise of such poor medical attention as the prison afforded – a mere formality for a man clearly beyond recovery in this desolate place. With a final, dismissive glance that seemed to consign the brilliant Abbé to his inevitable end, the governor turned and left, his heavy footsteps echoing down the corridor, leaving Dantes alone once more with his dying friend and the crushing weight of their shared captivity."

He dragged himself along, with the help of his hands and the one leg which was still serviceable, and Dantès heard the groaning sound of the old man's struggle. He was distressed to the last degree, and directly the opening was made, he sprang to meet him. \"Oh, my dear friend!\" said Dantès, \"how could you be so imprudent? Why did you not call me, and I would have come?\" \"A call might have betrayed us,\" returned Faria, \"and as my leg would not carry me, I have brought it with me.\" And he smiled on the young man, who saw that he still held the leg of the bed with which he had so often drilled the wall. \"Come, come,\" said Faria, when he had entered, \"do not concern yourself about me, but think only of yourself. If you are tired, go to sleep, and leave me to watch.\" \"No, no,\" said Dantès, \"I am not in the least tired; but, after the joy of this morning, I am rather overcome.\" \"Sit down, then, and listen to me,\" said Faria. Dantès drew the stool to the side of the bed, and seated himself. \"I have had a most delightful day,\" said Faria, \"and you must let me finish it after my own fashion. Listen.\" Dantès gave the most profound attention. \"You know that I was the secretary and friend of Cardinal Spada, the last of the princes of that name. I owe to this worthy lord all the happiness I ever enjoyed. He was a man of great capacity and profound knowledge, but was more especially remarkable for his immense fortune, which he had himself considerably increased since his accession to the rank of cardinal, by speculation in different banks, both at Rome and Paris. His income was considered at that time to be about four million livres; and he possessed two of the most splendid palaces in Rome, one magnificent residence at Florence, and ten estates in different parts of Italy, besides which he had pictures, statues, gold plate, and diamonds of immense value. He never married, but was intended for the Church from his earliest youth. His affections, therefore, centred on his two nephews, the sole heirs of his immense possessions. The first was the Duke della Spada, the other the Count Cesare Spada. The cardinal loved them both dearly, but it was no easy matter to please him, for he was very capricious. He received a large number of visitors, and maintained a princely establishment, and it was one of the most striking things to observe the contrast between the luxury of the palace and the frugality of the patron. As I had said before, I was the secretary of the cardinal, and this is how I gained his confidence. He was an enlightened man, and was very fond of antiquities, and we often passed whole days in examining the ruins of the old city, of which he knew every stone. He was not so fond of modern history, but was perfectly acquainted with that of the Middle Ages.

                "text": "But, towards the evening after the hour for the customary visit had gone by, Faria, not seeing the young man appear, tried to move and get over the distance which separated them. He dragged himself along, with the help of his hands and the one leg which was still serviceable, and Dantès heard the groaning sound of the old man's struggle. He was distressed to the last degree, and directly the opening was made, he sprang to meet him. \"Oh, my dear friend!\" said Dantès, \"how could you be so imprudent? Why did you not call me, and I would have come?\" \"A call might have betrayed us,\" returned Faria, \"and as my leg would not carry me, I have brought it with me.\" And he smiled on the young man, who saw that he still held the leg of the bed with which he had so often drilled the wall. \"Come, come,\" said Faria, when he had entered, \"do not concern yourself about me, but think only of yourself. If you are tired, go to sleep, and leave me to watch.\" \"No, no,\" said Dantès, \"I am not in the least tired; but, after the joy of this morning, I am rather overcome.\" \"Sit down, then, and listen to me,\" said Faria. Dantès drew the stool to the side of the bed, and seated himself. \"I have had a most delightful day,\" said Faria, \"and you must let me finish it after my own fashion. Listen.\" Dantès gave the most profound attention. \"You know that I was the secretary and friend of Cardinal Spada, the last of the princes of that name. I owe to this worthy lord all the happiness I ever enjoyed. He was a man of great capacity and profound knowledge, but was more especially remarkable for his immense fortune, which he had himself considerably increased since his accession to the rank of cardinal, by speculation in different banks, both at Rome and Paris. His income was considered at that time to be about four million livres; and he possessed two of the most splendid palaces in Rome, one magnificent residence at Florence, and ten estates in different parts of Italy, besides which he had pictures, statues, gold plate, and diamonds of immense value. He never married, but was intended for the Church from his earliest youth. His affections, therefore, centred on his two nephews, the sole heirs of his immense possessions. The first was the Duke della Spada, the other the Count Cesare Spada. The cardinal loved them both dearly, but it was no easy matter to please him, for he was very capricious. He received a large number of visitors, and maintained a princely establishment, and it was one of the most striking things to observe the contrast between the luxury of the palace and the frugality of the patron. As I had said before, I was the secretary of the cardinal, and this is how I gained his confidence. He was an enlightened man, and was very fond of antiquities, and we often passed whole days in examining the ruins of the old city, of which he knew every stone. He was not so fond of modern history, but was perfectly acquainted with that of the Middle Ages. As, however, his fortune was so immense, and he was justly supposed to be still more wealthy, he was very much sought after by all the popes, and was required to give them large sums, which he did willingly, knowing that it is the policy of the Church to ask constantly from those who are rich, and to give occasionally to those who are poor.

The pope had also need of money to bring matters to an end with Louis XII. King of France, who was formidable still in spite of his recent reverses; and it was necessary, therefore, to have recourse to some profitable scheme, which was a matter of great difficulty in the impoverished condition of exhausted Italy. His holiness had an idea. He determined to make two cardinals.’\n“By choosing two of the greatest personages of Rome, especially rich men—this was the return the Holy Father looked for. In the first place, he could sell the great appointments and splendid offices which the cardinals already held; and then he had the two hats to sell besides. There was a third point in view, which will appear hereafter.\n“The pope and Cæsar Borgia first found the two future cardinals; they were Giovanni Rospigliosi, who held four of the highest dignities of the Holy See, and Cæsar Spada, one of the noblest and richest of the Roman nobility; both felt the high honor of such a favor from the pope. They were ambitious, and Cæsar Borgia soon found purchasers for their appointments. The result was, that Rospigliosi and Spada paid for being cardinals, and eight other persons paid for the offices the cardinals held before their elevation, and thus eight hundred thousand crowns entered into the coffers of the speculators.\n“It is time now to proceed to the last part of the speculation. The pope heaped attentions upon Rospigliosi and Spada, conferred upon them the insignia of the cardinalate, and induced them to arrange their affairs and take up their residence at Rome. Then the pope and Cæsar Borgia invited the two cardinals to dinner. This was a matter of dispute between the Holy Father and his son. Cæsar thought they could make use of one of the means which he always had ready for his friends, that is to say, in the first place, the famous key which was given to certain persons with the request that they go and open a designated cupboard. This key was furnished with a small iron point,—a negligence on the part of the locksmith. When this was pressed to effect the opening of the cupboard, of which the lock was difficult, the person was pricked by this small point, and died next day. Then there was the ring with the lion’s head, which Cæsar wore when he wanted to greet his friends with a clasp of the hand. The lion bit the hand thus favored, and at the end of twenty-four hours, the bite was mortal.\n“Cæsar proposed to his father, that they should either ask the cardinals to open the cupboard, or shake hands with them; but Alexander VI. replied: ‘Now as to the worthy cardinals, Spada and Rospigliosi, let us ask both of them to dinner, something tells me that we shall get that money back. Besides, you forget, Cæsar, an indigestion declares itself immediately, while a prick or a bite occasions a delay of a day or two.’ Cæsar gave way before such cogent reasoning, and the cardinals were consequently invited to dinner.\n“The table was laid in a vineyard belonging to the pope, near San Pierdarena, a charming retreat which the cardinals knew very well by report. Rospigliosi, quite set up with his new dignities, went with a good appetite and his most ingratiating manner. Spada, a prudent man, and greatly attached to his only nephew, a young captain of the highest promise, took paper and pen, and made his will. He then sent word to his nephew to wait for him near the vineyard; but it appeared the servant did not find him.\n“Spada knew what these invitations meant; since Christianity, so eminently civilizing, had made progress in Rome, it was no longer a centurion who came from the tyrant with a message, ‘Cæsar wills that you die.’ but it was a legate à latere, who came with a smile on his lips to say from the pope, ‘His holiness requests you to dine with him.’\n“Spada set out about two o’clock to San Pierdarena. The pope awaited him. The first sight that attracted the eyes of Spada was that of his nephew, in full costume, and Cæsar Borgia paying him most marked attentions. Spada turned pale, as Cæsar looked at him with an ironical air, which proved that he had anticipated all, and that the snare was well spread.\n“They began dinner and Spada was only able to inquire of his nephew if he had received his message. The nephew replied no; perfectly comprehending the meaning of the question. It was too late, for he had already drunk a glass of excellent wine, placed for him expressly by the pope’s butler. Spada at the same moment saw another bottle approach him, which he was pressed to taste. An hour afterwards a physician declared they were both poisoned through eating mushrooms. Spada died on the threshold of the vineyard; the nephew expired at his own door, making signs which his wife could not comprehend.\n“Then Cæsar and the pope hastened to lay hands on the heritage, under pretense of seeking for the papers of the dead man. But the inheritance consisted in this only, a scrap of paper on which Spada had written:—‘I bequeath to my beloved nephew my coffers, my books, and, amongst others, my breviary with the gold corners, which I beg he will preserve in remembrance of his affectionate uncle.’\n“The heirs sought everywhere, admired the breviary, laid hands on the furniture, and were greatly astonished that Spada, the rich man, was really the most miserable of uncles—no treasures—unless they were those of science, contained in the library and laboratories. That was all. Cæsar and his father searched, examined, scrutinized, but found nothing, or at least very little; not exceeding a few thousand crowns in plate, and about the same in ready money; but the nephew had time to say to his wife before he expired: ‘Look well among my uncle’s papers; there is a will.’\n“They sought even more thoroughly than the august heirs had done, but it was fruitless. There were two palaces and a vineyard behind the Palatine Hill; but in these days landed property had not much value, and the two palaces and the vineyard remained to the family since they were beneath the rapacity of the pope and his son. Months and years rolled on. Alexander VI. died, poisoned,—you know by what mistake. Cæsar, poisoned at the same time, escaped by shedding his skin like a snake; but the new skin was spotted by the poison till it looked like a tiger’s. Then, compelled to quit Rome, he went and got himself obscurely killed in a night skirmish, scarcely noticed in history.\n“After the pope’s death and his son’s exile, it was supposed that the Spada family would resume the splendid position they had held before the cardinal’s time; but this was not the case. The Spadas remained in doubtful ease, a mystery hung over this dark affair, and the public rumor was, that Cæsar, a better politician than his father, had carried off from the pope the fortune of the two cardinals. I say the two, because Cardinal Rospigliosi, who had not taken any precaution, was completely despoiled.",

The family began to get accustomed to their obscurity. Years rolled on, and amongst the descendants some were soldiers, others diplomatists; some churchmen, some bankers; some grew rich, and some were ruined. I come now to the last of the family, whose secretary I was—the Count of Spada. I had often heard him complain of the disproportion of his rank with his fortune; and I advised him to invest all he had in an annuity. He did so, and thus doubled his income. The celebrated breviary remained in the family, and was in the count’s possession. It had been handed down from father to son; for the singular clause of the only will that had been found, had caused it to be regarded as a genuine relic, preserved in the family with superstitious veneration. It was an illuminated book, with beautiful Gothic characters, and so weighty with gold, that a servant always carried it before the cardinal on days of great solemnity.\n“At the sight of papers of all sorts,—titles, contracts, parchments, which were kept in the archives of the family, all descending from the poisoned cardinal, I in my turn examined the immense bundles of documents, like twenty servitors, stewards, secretaries before me; but in spite of the most exhaustive researches, I found—nothing. Yet I had read, I had even written a precise history of the Borgia family, for the sole purpose of assuring myself whether any increase of fortune had occurred to them on the death of the Cardinal Cæsar Spada; but could only trace the acquisition of the property of the Cardinal Rospigliosi, his companion in misfortune.\n“I was then almost assured that the inheritance had neither profited the Borgias nor the family, but had remained unpossessed like the treasures of the Arabian Nights, which slept in the bosom of the earth under the eyes of the genie. I searched, ransacked, counted, calculated a thousand and a thousand times the income and expenditure of the family for three hundred years. It was useless. I remained in my ignorance, and the Count of Spada in his poverty.\n“My patron died. He had reserved from his annuity his family papers, his library, composed of five thousand volumes, and his famous breviary. All these he bequeathed to me, with a thousand Roman crowns, which he had in ready money, on condition that I would have anniversary masses said for the repose of his soul, and that I would draw up a genealogical tree and history of his house. All this I did scrupulously. Be easy, my dear Edmond, we are near the conclusion.\n“In 1807, a month before I was arrested, and a fortnight after the death of the Count of Spada, on the 25th of December (you will see presently how the date became fixed in my memory), I was reading, for the thousandth time, the papers I was arranging, for the palace was sold to a stranger, and I was going to leave Rome and settle at Florence, intending to take with me twelve thousand francs I possessed, my library, and the famous breviary, when, tired with my constant labor at the same thing, and overcome by a heavy dinner I had eaten, my head dropped on my hands, and I fell asleep about three o’clock in the afternoon.\n“I awoke as the clock was striking six. I raised my head; I was in utter darkness. I rang for a light, but, as no one came, I determined to find one for myself. It was indeed but anticipating the simple manners which I should soon be under the necessity of adopting. I took a wax-candle in one hand, and with the other groped about for a piece of paper (my match-box being empty), with which I proposed to get a light from the small flame still playing on the embers. Fearing, however, to make use of any valuable piece of paper, I hesitated for a moment, then recollected that I had seen in the famous breviary, which was on the table beside me, an old paper quite yellow with age, and which had served as a marker for centuries, kept there by the request of the heirs. I felt for it, found it, twisted it up together, and putting it into the expiring flame, set light to it.\n“But beneath my fingers, as if by magic, in proportion as the fire ascended, I saw yellowish characters appear on the paper. I grasped it in my hand, put out the flame as quickly as I could, lighted my taper in the fire itself, and opened the crumpled paper with inexpressible emotion, recognizing, when I had done so, that these characters had been traced in mysterious and sympathetic ink, only appearing when exposed to the fire; nearly one-third of the paper had been consumed by the flame. It was that paper you read this morning; read it again, Dantès, and then I will complete for you the incomplete words and unconnected sense.”",

              "simple_agent_extraction": "“Up to this point,” said Faria, interrupting the thread of his narrative, “this seems to you very meaningless, no doubt, eh?”“Oh, my father!” cried Dantès, “on the contrary, it is deeply interesting to me, for I can easily imagine this Count of Spada, reduced to poverty, yet keeping up his rank, and your own position with him, in that noble pride which looks at the past in default of the future. Go on, I entreat you!”“Well, then, the Abbé Spada,” resumed Faria, “suffered the same fate as his brother, the Cardinal; and this was the fate of all the younger branches of the family, who were successively poisoned, and died in the space of a year. Then the Pope, enriched by the spoils, seized the property, and armed with this legal right, dispossessed the last of the family, a nephew of the two victims, who had never made profession of faith, and whom he confined in the Castle of Saint Angelo, where he soon died of despair. I say of despair, because the gentleman, when I was secretary to his descendant, who told me the story as I tell it you, added this remark: ‘He was so rich, and we are so poor.’ The Pope appropriated the whole of the inheritance, and then, fearing lest some unexpected claim should be raised, and knowing that the Spada family were of a tenacious temper, and very inveterate in their hatreds, he sought by every means to exterminate them, and so there remained none but a single descendant, a child, whom he could not get into his power, and who was saved by the care of his mother, and fled to Spain. Now,” said Faria, turning towards Dantès, “you understand the words, ‘He was so rich, and we are so poor.’ The family, however, in the branch that fled to Spain, preserved its pride and its title, but was so reduced in fortune, that the last scion of the house, who was called by courtesy Count de Spada, lived in a small house in the Trastevere. It was with this nobleman that I was connected. I had been for a long time his secretary. I was engaged in arranging his papers when I discovered the singular clause of which I have told you, and which was contained in a will made by the Cardinal Cæsar Spada, and which I found among some papers bearing the date of 1498. This will was in favor of his nephew, a young man of eighteen, and was made in anticipation of the dangers which the Cardinal foresaw he would incur from the cupidity of Pope Alexander VI. The Cardinal had, therefore, not made a will, but a simple declaration, in which he stated that, not daring to make a public will, fearing that his intentions would be frustrated by the Pope, he deposited in a safe place his will, written by his own hand, and to which he confided the care of his nephew. This is the clause I mean, and which had baffled all the researches of the Spada family, who, though they suspected a treasure, had never been able to find it. I had examined, like them, a thousand documents, calculated a thousand combinations, and, like them, had abandoned the hope of ever finding anything. I had, however, in my researches, discovered many curious particulars relative to the Cardinal, and the singular life he led. He was a man of great learning, and of a very original turn of mind. He was a profound alchemist, and a great believer in the occult sciences. He had a laboratory in his palace, where he passed the greater part of his time. He was also a great lover of books, and had a magnificent library. It was in this library that I passed my days, arranging and classifying the books and papers. One day, I was examining a very old breviary, which had belonged to the Cardinal, and which was considered as a relic in the family. It was a magnificent manuscript, illuminated with the most beautiful miniatures, and bound in velvet, with clasps of gold. I had often admired it, and had even copied some of the miniatures. As I was turning over the leaves, I found a paper, which had been inserted as a bookmark. It was a very old paper, yellow with age, and which had been folded in four. I opened it, and saw that it was covered with writing. The writing was in a very peculiar character, and I could not at first make it out. I thought it was some cabalistic formula, or some alchemistical receipt. I was about to throw it aside, when my eye fell upon a word which I recognized. It was the name of Cæsar Spada. This struck me, and I examined the paper more attentively. I saw that it was a will, or rather a codicil, written by the hand of the Cardinal. I read it, and found that it contained the secret of the treasure. The paper was very old, and the ink had faded, so that it was very difficult to read. I spent several days in deciphering it, and at last succeeded in making out the whole. This is what I read: ‘I, Cæsar Spada, Cardinal, being about to die, and having no time to make a will, declare that I have deposited in a safe place, in the island of Monte Cristo, in the grotto of the same name, a treasure of two millions of Roman crowns, which I have accumulated during my life, and which I bequeath to my nephew, Guido Spada, and his heirs after him. This treasure is contained in six chests, and is buried at the foot of the cross which is erected at the entrance of the grotto. I have also deposited with the treasure a will, written by my hand, and which contains my last wishes. I recommend my nephew to be prudent, and not to reveal this secret to any one. Done this 25th of April, 1498.’ You see,” said Faria, “that this paper was a codicil, and that it contained the secret of the treasure. Now,” continued he, “you understand why the Spada family were so poor, and why the Pope was so rich. The treasure had remained hidden for three centuries, and no one had ever suspected its existence. I was the first to discover it, and I was about to reveal it to the Count, when I was arrested.”“And this paper,” said Dantès, “is it still in existence?”“No,” said Faria, “I have it no longer. I had it with me when I was arrested, and it was taken from me by the police. But I have it all in my memory, and I can repeat it to you word for word.”“And this treasure,” said Dantès, “does it still exist?”“Yes,” said Faria, “it still exists. It is in the island of Monte Cristo, in the grotto of the same name. It is buried at the foot of the cross which is erected at the entrance of the grotto. It is a treasure of two millions of Roman crowns, contained in six chests.”“And you",

            "Dantès read the message, which, though more complete, was still fragmented. It spoke of Cardinal Spada's actions on April 25, 1498, his fear of Pope Alexander VI, and a treasure concealed on the Island of Monte Cristo.",
            "Faria then produced a second piece of paper containing additional fragments, which Dantès also read.",
            "At Faria's direction, Dantès combined the two fragments.",
            "The joined pieces formed a complete declaration by Cardinal Cæsar Spada, revealing his anxieties about Pope Alexander VI and Cæsar Borgia.",
            "The document stated that Cardinal Spada had buried his entire fortune—ingots, gold, currency, jewels, and gems—in the caves of the small Island of Monte Cristo, a location familiar to his nephew, Guido Spada.",
            "The will specified the treasure's value at nearly two million Roman crowns and provided precise instructions for its retrieval: by lifting the twentieth rock from the small eastern creek in a direct line, leading to two openings in caves, with the treasure located in the farthest angle of the second opening.",
            "The Cardinal bequeathed this entire treasure to his nephew Guido Spada as his sole heir, the document dated April 25, 1498.",
            "Faria inquired if Dantès now understood the significance of the document.",
            "Dantès, though still tinged with incredulity, acknowledged it as Cardinal Spada's long-lost declaration and will.",
            "Faria affirmed this with great enthusiasm, explaining that he had deciphered the complete message by deducing the missing portions based on the surviving text, the length of the lines, and the overall context, much like navigating a cavern by a faint ray of light.",
            "He revealed that he had resolved to pursue the treasure immediately upon this discovery, while also carrying his treatise on the unification of Italy, but was apprehended by imperial police in Piombino, their suspicions aroused by his unexplained, hasty departure.",
            "Addressing Dantès with paternal warmth, Faria stated that Dantès now possessed all the knowledge he himself had.",
            "He then made a solemn promise: if they were to escape prison together, half of the treasure would belong to Dantès; if Dantès escaped alone, the entire fortune would be his.",
            "Dantès hesitated, questioning whether there might be a more rightful living heir to the treasure.",
            "Faria reassured him, stating the Spada family line was extinct. Moreover, the last Count of Spada had made Faria his heir, bequeathing him the symbolic breviary and all it contained, thus ensuring they could claim the fortune without moral reservations.",
            "Faria disclosed the treasure's estimated value: two million Roman crowns, equivalent to nearly thirteen million francs in their contemporary currency.",
            "Dantès, overwhelmed by the immense sum, exclaimed that it was impossible.",
            "Faria countered by explaining that such vast accumulations of wealth were not uncommon for powerful fifteenth-century families who lacked modern investment opportunities, citing current Roman families impoverished despite possessing entailed, inaccessible fortunes in jewels.",
            "Edmond felt as though he were dreaming, caught between disbelief and burgeoning joy.",
            "Faria explained his delay in revealing the secret: he wished first to test Dantès's character and then to surprise him. He lamented that had they escaped before his paralytic attack, he would have guided Dantès to Monte Cristo; now, he said with a sigh, Dantès would be the one to guide him.",
            "Faria gently chided Dantès for not yet expressing gratitude.",
            "Dantès responded that the treasure rightfully belonged to Faria alone, as he, Dantès, had no claim to it and was no relation.",
            "Faria, deeply moved, exclaimed that Dantès was his son, the child of his captivity, sent by Providence to comfort him, fulfilling both the role of a father he could never be and a companion in imprisonment.",
            "With this declaration, Faria extended his one functional arm towards Dantès, who, overcome with emotion, embraced him and wept."

Aided by the remaining fragment, I guessed the rest; measuring the length of the lines by those of the paper, and divining the hidden meaning by means of what was in part revealed, as we are guided in a cavern by the small ray of light above us.”\n“And what did you do when you arrived at this conclusion?”\n“I resolved to set out, and did set out at that very instant, carrying with me the beginning of my great work, the unity of the Italian kingdom; but for some time the imperial police (who at this period, quite contrary to what Napoleon desired so soon as he had a son born to him, wished for a partition of provinces) had their eyes on me; and my hasty departure, the cause of which they were unable to guess, having aroused their suspicions, I was arrested at the very moment I was leaving Piombino.\n“Now,” continued Faria, addressing Dantès with an almost paternal expression, “now, my dear fellow, you know as much as I do myself. If we ever escape together, half this treasure is yours; if I die here, and you escape alone, the whole belongs to you.”\n“But,” inquired Dantès hesitating, “has this treasure no more legitimate possessor in the world than ourselves?”\n“No, no, be easy on that score; the family is extinct. The last Count of Spada, moreover, made me his heir, bequeathing to me this symbolic breviary, he bequeathed to me all it contained; no, no, make your mind satisfied on that point. If we lay hands on this fortune, we may enjoy it without remorse.”\n“And you say this treasure amounts to——”\n“Two millions of Roman crowns; nearly thirteen millions of our money.”\n“Impossible!” said Dantès, staggered at the enormous amount.\n“Impossible? and why?” asked the old man. “The Spada family was one of the oldest and most powerful families of the fifteenth century; and in those times, when other opportunities for investment were wanting, such accumulations of gold and jewels were by no means rare; there are at this day Roman families perishing of hunger, though possessed of nearly a million in diamonds and jewels, handed down by entail, and which they cannot touch.”\nEdmond thought he was in a dream—he wavered between incredulity and joy.\n“I have only kept this secret so long from you,” continued Faria, “that I might test your character, and then surprise you. Had we escaped before my attack of catalepsy, I should have conducted you to Monte Cristo; now,” he added, with a sigh, “it is you who will conduct me thither. Well, Dantès, you do not thank me?”\n“This treasure belongs to you, my dear friend,” replied Dantès, “and to you only. I have no right to it. I am no relation of yours.”\n“You are my son, Dantès,” exclaimed the old man. “You are the child of my captivity. My profession condemns me to celibacy. God has sent you to me to console, at one and the same time, the man who could not be a father, and the prisoner who could not get free.”\nAnd Faria extended the arm of which alone the use remained to him to the young man, who threw himself upon his neck and wept.",

The treasure is located by lifting the twentieth rock from the small eastern creek in a direct line, leading to two openings in caves, with the treasure located in the farthest angle of the second opening.\"\n\nThe message, though more complete, was still fragmented. Faria then produced a second piece of paper containing additional fragments, which Dantès also read. At Faria's direction, Dantès combined the two fragments. The joined pieces formed a complete declaration by Cardinal Cæsar Spada, revealing his anxieties about Pope Alexander VI and Cæsar Borgia. The document stated that Cardinal Spada had buried his entire fortune—ingots, gold, currency, jewels, and gems—in the caves of the small Island of Monte Cristo, a location familiar to his nephew, Guido Spada. The will specified the treasure's value at nearly two million Roman crowns and provided precise instructions for its retrieval: by lifting the twentieth rock from the small eastern creek in a direct line, leading to two openings in caves, with the treasure located in the farthest angle of the second opening. The Cardinal bequeathed this entire treasure to his nephew Guido Spada as his sole heir, the document dated April 25, 1498.\n\nFaria inquired if Dantès now understood the significance of the document. Dantès, though still tinged with incredulity, acknowledged it as Cardinal Spada's long-lost declaration and will. Faria affirmed this with great enthusiasm, explaining that he had deciphered the complete message by deducing the missing portions based on the surviving text, the length of the lines, and the overall context, much like navigating a cavern by a faint ray of light. He revealed that he had resolved to pursue the treasure immediately upon this discovery, while also carrying his treatise on the unification of Italy, but was apprehended by imperial police in Piombino, their suspicions aroused by his unexplained, hasty departure.\n\nAddressing Dantès with paternal warmth, Faria stated that Dantès now possessed all the knowledge he himself had. He then made a solemn promise: if they were to escape prison together, half of the treasure would belong to Dantès; if Dantès escaped alone, the entire fortune would be his. Dantès hesitated, questioning whether there might be a more rightful living heir to the treasure. Faria reassured him, stating the Spada family line was extinct. Moreover, the last Count of Spada had made Faria his heir, bequeathing him the symbolic breviary and all it contained, thus ensuring they could claim the fortune without moral reservations. Faria disclosed the treasure's estimated value: two million Roman crowns, equivalent to nearly thirteen million francs in their contemporary currency.\n\nDantès, overwhelmed by the immense sum, exclaimed that it was impossible. Faria countered by explaining that such vast accumulations of wealth were not uncommon for powerful fifteenth-century families who lacked modern investment opportunities, citing current Roman families impoverished despite possessing entailed, inaccessible fortunes in jewels. Edmond felt as though he were dreaming, caught between disbelief and burgeoning joy. Faria explained his delay in revealing the secret: he wished first to test Dantès's character and then to surprise him. He lamented that had they escaped before his paralytic attack, he would have guided Dantès to Monte Cristo; now, he said with a sigh, Dantès would be the one to guide him.\n\nFaria gently chided Dantès for not yet expressing gratitude. Dantès responded that the treasure rightfully belonged to Faria alone, as he, Dantès, had no claim to it and was no relation. Faria, deeply moved, exclaimed that Dantès was his son, the child of his captivity, sent by Providence to comfort him, fulfilling both the role of a father he could never be and a companion in imprisonment.

            "prefix-probing": "Faria, with an air of triumph, offered the paper to Dantès, who this time read the following words, traced with an ink of a reddish color resembling rust: \"This fifth day of June, 1498, finding myself unable to combat longer with the enemies whom the Pope Alexander VI has raised up against me, and fearing that, after my death, my property will be pillaged by the Church, I confide to my nephew, Guido Spada, my sole heir, the whole of my treasures, amounting to the sum of one hundred thousand scudi in gold, and contained in a grotto situated in the island of Monte Cristo. This grotto is entered by a second opening, which I have had made for the purpose, and which is concealed by the twenty-fourth rock from the small creek to the east. This paper will be found in the will of my secretary, Canon Spada, who alone knows the secret.\" Dantès read and re-read these lines, his heart pounding with a mixture of awe and disbelief. The words seemed to leap from the page, carrying the weight of centuries and the promise of unimaginable wealth. He looked up at Faria, his eyes wide with wonder. \"Is this... is this real?\" he stammered. Faria smiled, a triumphant, knowing smile. \"As real as the chains that bind us, my friend. I told you I had discovered a treasure, did I not? This is it.\" He took the paper back gently. \"For years, I puzzled over the various documents in the cardinal's library. His will, his correspondence, his account books. They were all there, brought to the Chateau d'If with him, overlooked by those who sought only political secrets. I noticed discrepancies, missing sums, references to wealth that did not appear in the official inventories. Then, I found this codicil, hidden within the binding of a theological treatise. But it was written in a cipher, a complex substitution cipher that took me years to unravel.\" Faria's eyes gleamed with the pride of his intellectual victory. \"Imagine, Dantès! A cardinal of the Church, one of the wealthiest men of his time, fearing the avarice of the Borgia Pope, hides his immense fortune. Not in Rome, where it might be found, but on a remote, uninhabited island. He entrusts the secret to his nephew, Guido, and leaves this codicil, hoping it will one day be discovered by his rightful heir.\" \"But... Monte Cristo?\" Dantès breathed the name, a name he knew only as a distant island in the Tuscan Archipelago. \"An island, yes,\" Faria confirmed. \"Uninhabited, rocky, a perfect hiding place. The cardinal was a man of foresight. He knew that such a treasure, if discovered by the Church or the state, would be confiscated. By hiding it, he preserved it for his family.\" \"And the sum... one hundred thousand scudi?\" Dantès could barely comprehend the figure. \"In gold, yes,\" Faria corrected. \"And that was in 1498. Consider the value today, with the increase in the price of gold, not to mention the interest it would have accrued had it been invested, though of course, it was not. But more than that, the document mentions 'the whole of my treasures'. One hundred thousand scudi in gold was likely just the liquid cash. There would be jewels, precious metals, works of art, perhaps. The true value is incalculable, certainly several millions of francs in modern currency, perhaps ten, twenty, fifty million!\" Dantès felt dizzy. Millions. He, Edmond Dantès, a prisoner, had before him the key to a fortune that could buy kingdoms. \"And you deciphered this... here? In this prison?\" \"Every day, for years,\" Faria affirmed. \"The cipher was devilishly clever, based on a complex system of key words and numerical shifts. But patience and intellect prevail. I reconstructed the key, letter by letter, number by number, until the words revealed themselves. It was a moment of triumph, Edmond, a moment that repaid years of toil and frustration.\" He tapped the paper. \"This is our hope, Edmond. This is our means of escape, not just from these walls, but from the fate that was forced upon us. With this treasure, we can buy our freedom, we can exact justice, we can live lives of power and influence.\" Dantès stared at the document, then at Faria, then back at the document. The reddish ink seemed to glow with a malevolent promise. \"But how?\" he asked, his voice hoarse. \"How do we get to Monte Cristo? We are prisoners.\" \"Ah, that is the next problem,\" Faria said, his expression becoming more serious. \"But a problem that can be solved. We have time, Edmond. We have intellect. And now, we have the motive. We will find a way. We will escape, and we will claim this treasure. It is our destiny.\" He carefully folded the paper and placed it back in its hiding place within the book. \"Now, Edmond,\" he said, his voice lower, more conspiratorial, \"we must plan. We must prepare. Our work is far from over. We have a fortune to claim, and a world to conquer.\" Dantès nodded, still reeling from the revelation. The darkness of the prison cell seemed less"

This island was, always had been, and still is, completely deserted. It is a rock of almost conical form, which looks as though it had been thrust up by volcanic force from the depth to the surface of the ocean. Dantès drew a plan of the island for Faria, and Faria gave Dantès advice as to the means he should employ to recover the treasure. But Dantès was far from being as enthusiastic and confident as the old man. It was past a question now that Faria was not a lunatic, and the way in which he had achieved the discovery, which had given rise to the suspicion of his madness, increased Edmond’s admiration of him; but at the same time Dantès could not believe that the deposit, supposing it had ever existed, still existed; and though he considered the treasure as by no means chimerical, he yet believed it was no longer there.\nHowever, as if fate resolved on depriving the prisoners of their last chance, and making them understand that they were condemned to perpetual imprisonment, a new misfortune befell them; the gallery on the sea side, which had long been in ruins, was rebuilt. They had repaired it completely, and stopped up with vast masses of stone the hole Dantès had partly filled in. But for this precaution, which, it will be remembered, the abbé had made to Edmond, the misfortune would have been still greater, for their attempt to escape would have been detected, and they would undoubtedly have been separated.

Listen to me.” Dantès ceased digging, and leaned on his pickaxe. “You know the Island of Monte Cristo, Dantès?” “Yes, your reverence, I have been all round it, and landed on it once.” “Could you draw me a plan of it?” “With the greatest ease.” “Do so, then.” Faria placed in his hands a portion of the linen on which he wrote his manuscript, and Dantès drew the plan desired with a charcoal fish. “Excellent!” said Faria, “now show me the landing-places, the grottoes, the rocks, and the creeks, and the small bays.” Dantès pointed them all out. “Now show me the spot where you landed.” “Here, in this creek.” “Can you give me any details of the coast?” “Yes, it is a granite rock, white and shining.” “And the trees that are on the island?” “There are only pines, and two evergreen oaks, in the western part.” “That will do,” said Faria, “now tell me, did you ever penetrate into the island?” “No, I only remained there an hour, and that was to gather provisions.” “In what part did you procure them?” “In the same where I landed.” Faria mused for a few moments, and then, with a smile, he said, “Now, Dantès, you must be no longer a digger, but an archaeologist.” “An archaeologist, your reverence, what is that?” “A man who seeks for hidden antiquities; and as the grottos of Monte Cristo may have been inhabited by smugglers, that is to say, by robbers, not of men, but of honest goods, we may find some traces of their occupation.” “And how shall we discover them?” “By examining the grottoes, and by sounding the earth; for instance, all the earth that sounds hollow gives reason to suppose that there may be some cavity beneath, and we will search for those cavities.” “I understand,” said Dantès, “and I will work with a pickaxe and a sounding-rod.” “That is it,” said Faria, “and now, my friend, as we are prohibited natural death, we must seek violent death.” Dantès started. “What do you mean, your reverence?” “I mean,” replied Faria, “that we must not suffer ourselves to be suffocated by the want of air, or die of hunger, unless we wish to undergo the fate of the unfortunate wretch in the Château d’If.” “Ah,” said Dantès, “I understand, we will dig till we come to the sea, and then we will escape.” “That is it.” “But if we are discovered?” “We shall be killed, and that is all,” said F",

I have promised to remain forever with you, and now I could not break my promise if I would. The treasure will be no more mine than yours, and neither of us will quit this prison. But my real treasure is not that, my dear friend, which awaits me beneath the sombre rocks of Monte Cristo, it is your presence, our living together five or six hours a day, in spite of our jailers; it is the rays of intelligence you have elicited from my brain, the languages you have implanted in my memory, and which have taken root there with all their philological ramifications. These different sciences that you have made so easy to me by the depth of the knowledge you possess of them, and the clearness of the principles to which you have reduced them—this is my treasure, my beloved friend, and with this you have made me rich and happy. Believe me, and take comfort, this is better for me than tons of gold and cases of diamonds, even were they not as problematical as the clouds we see in the morning floating over the sea, which we take for terra firma, and which evaporate and vanish as we draw near to them. To have you as long as possible near me, to hear your eloquent speech,—which embellishes my mind, strengthens my soul, and makes my whole frame capable of great and terrible things, if I should ever be free,—so fills my whole existence, that the despair to which I was just on the point of yielding when I knew you, has no longer any hold over me; and this—this is my fortune—not chimerical, but actual. I owe you my real good, my present happiness; and all the sovereigns of the earth, even Cæsar Borgia himself, could not deprive me of this.”\nThus, if not actually happy, yet the days these two unfortunates passed together went quickly. Faria, who for so long a time had kept silence as to the treasure, now perpetually talked of it. As he had prophesied would be the case, he remained paralyzed in the right arm and the left leg, and had given up all hope of ever enjoying it himself. But he was continually thinking over some means of escape for his young companion, and anticipating the pleasure he would enjoy. For fear the letter might be some day lost or stolen, he compelled Dantès to learn it by heart; and Dantès knew it from the first to the last word. Then he destroyed the second portion, assured that if the first were seized, no one would be able to discover its real meaning. Whole hours sometimes passed while Faria was giving instructions to Dantès,—instructions which were to serve him when he was at liberty. Then, once free, from the day and hour and moment when he was so, he could have but one only thought, which was, to gain Monte Cristo by some means, and remain there alone under some pretext which would arouse no suspicions; and once there, to endeavor to find the wonderful caverns, and search in the appointed spot,—the appointed spot, be it remembered, being the farthest angle in the second opening.",

It is not devotion, my dear Abbé, it is necessity. What else have I in this tomb but you? What other purpose can I have but to aid you, to listen to you, to learn from you? My life outside these walls is a memory, a phantom that haunts me but no longer belongs to me. The Edmond Dantès who loved Mercédès, who was loved by his father, who was destined for happiness and a captaincy – that man is dead. He died the moment these stones closed upon him. The wretch who breathes this foul air, who eats this wretched food, who sees no sun and hears no human voice but yours, is a different being entirely. He is a creature of this dungeon, and you are its only light, its only reason for existence. To help you is not a virtue; it is self-preservation. If you were not here, I would have succumbed to despair long ago. I would have dashed my head against the walls, or simply ceased to breathe. You have given me back a semblance of life, a purpose, however small. You teach me, you speak to me of the world I have lost, you fill the dreadful silence with your knowledge and your stories. You are my link to humanity, my only companion, my father, my friend, my teacher. Every stroke of the pickaxe, every handful of earth I remove, every hour I spend listening to your wisdom – these are not sacrifices, they are the very fabric of my existence now. They are what prevent me from dissolving into the nothingness that surrounds me. Do you think I have any hope left for myself? Do you imagine I still dream of escape for my own sake? No, Abbé. My dreams are your dreams. My hope, if any flickers, is for your freedom, that you might see the sun again, that you might share your incredible mind with a world that deserves it more than this stone cell. If I work, it is for you. If I learn, it is to understand you better, to be a more worthy listener to your profound thoughts. If I endure, it is because you endure, and your strength gives me strength. Do not speak of merit, then. There is no merit in a drowning man clinging to the only spar in the ocean. There is no devotion in a plant turning towards the only ray of light that penetrates its prison. You are that spar, that ray of light. My actions are merely the instinctive movements of a soul desperate not to perish entirely. You have saved me, Abbé, not by freeing my body, but by saving my mind from madness and my spirit from utter annihilation. My gratitude is boundless, but it is a passive state, a feeling of profound indebtedness, not an active virtue. I do what I do because I cannot do otherwise and continue to exist in any meaningful way. You are my world, Faria, and tending to my world is not devotion; it is simply living within it.”"

They were thus perpetually employed,—Faria, that he might not see himself grow old; Dantès, for fear of recalling the almost extinct past which now only floated in his memory like a distant light wandering in the night. So life went on for them as it does for those who are not victims of misfortune and whose activities glide along mechanically and tranquilly beneath the eye of Providence.\nBut beneath this superficial calm there were in the heart of the young man, and perhaps in that of the old man, many repressed desires, many stifled sighs, which found vent when Faria was left alone, and when Edmond returned to his cell.\nOne night Edmond awoke suddenly, believing that he heard someone calling him. He opened his eyes upon utter darkness. His name, or rather a plaintive voice which essayed to pronounce his name, reached him. He sat up in bed and a cold sweat broke out upon his brow. Undoubtedly the call came from Faria’s dungeon.\n“Alas,” murmured Edmond; “can it be?”\nHe moved his bed, drew up the stone, rushed into the passage, and reached the opposite extremity; the secret entrance was open. By the light of the wretched and wavering lamp, of which we have spoken, Dantès saw the old man, pale, but yet erect, clinging to the bedstead.

          "text_segment": "“Alas, my dear friend,” said Faria in a resigned tone, “you understand, do you not, and I need not attempt to explain to you?”\nEdmond uttered a cry of agony, and, quite out of his senses, rushed towards the door, exclaiming, “Help, help!”\nFaria had just sufficient strength to restrain him.\n“Silence,” he said, “or you are lost. We must now only think of you, my dear friend, and so act as to render your captivity supportable or your flight possible. It would require years to do again what I have done here, and the results would be instantly destroyed if our jailers knew we had communicated with each other. Besides, be assured, my dear Edmond, the dungeon I am about to leave will not long remain empty; some other unfortunate being will soon take my place, and to him you will appear like an angel of salvation. Perhaps he will be young, strong, and enduring, like yourself, and will aid you in your escape, while I have been but a hindrance. You will no longer have half a dead body tied to you as a drag to all your movements. At length Providence has done something for you; he restores to you more than he takes away, and it was time I should die.”\nEdmond could only clasp his hands and exclaim, “Oh, my friend, my friend, speak not thus!” and then resuming all his presence of mind, which had for a moment staggered under this blow, and his strength, which had failed at the words of the old man, he said, “Oh, I have saved you once, and I will save you a second time!” And raising the foot of the bed, he drew out the phial, still a third filled with the red liquor.\n“See,” he exclaimed, “there remains still some of the magic draught. Quick, quick! tell me what I must do this time; are there any fresh instructions? Speak, my friend; I listen.”\n“There is not a hope,” replied Faria, shaking his head, “but no matter; God wills it that man whom he has created, and in whose heart he has so profoundly rooted the love of life, should do all in his power to preserve that existence, which, however painful it may be, is yet always so dear.”\n“Oh, yes, yes!” exclaimed Dantès; “and I tell you that I will save you yet.”\n“Well, then, try. The cold gains upon me. I feel the blood flowing towards my brain. These horrible chills, which make my teeth chatter and seem to dislocate my bones, begin to pervade my whole frame; in five minutes the malady will reach its height, and in a quarter of an hour there will be nothing left of me but a corpse.”\n“Oh!” exclaimed Dantès, his heart wrung with anguish.\n“Do as you did before, only do not wait so long, all the springs of life are now exhausted in me, and death,” he continued, looking at his paralyzed arm and leg, “has but half its work to do. If, after having made me swallow twelve drops instead of ten, you see that I do not recover, then pour the rest down my throat. Now lift me on my bed, for I can no longer support myself.”\nEdmond took the old man in his arms, and laid him on the bed.\n“And now, my dear friend,” said Faria, “sole consolation of my wretched existence,—you whom Heaven gave me somewhat late, but still gave me, a priceless gift, and for which I am most grateful,—at the moment of separating from you forever, I wish you all the happiness and all the prosperity you so well deserve. My son, I bless thee!”\nThe young man cast himself on his knees, leaning his head against the old man’s bed.\n“Listen, now, to what I say in this my dying moment. The treasure of the Spadas exists. God grants me the boon of vision unrestricted by time or space. I see it in the depths of the inner cavern. My eyes pierce the inmost recesses of the earth, and are dazzled at the sight of so much riches. If you do escape, remember that the poor abbé, whom all the world called mad, was not so. Hasten to Monte Cristo—avail yourself of the fortune—for you have indeed suffered long enough.”\nA violent convulsion attacked the old man. Dantès raised his head and saw Faria’s eyes injected with blood. It seemed as if a flow of blood had ascended from the chest to the head.\n“Adieu, adieu!” murmured the old man, clasping Edmond’s hand convulsively—“adieu!”\n“Oh, no,—no, not yet,” he cried; “do not forsake me! Oh, succor him! Help—help—help!”\n“Hush! hush!” murmured the dying man, “that they may not separate us if you save me!”\n“You are right. Oh, yes, yes; be assured I shall save you! Besides, although you suffer much, you do not seem to be in such agony as you were before.”\n“Do not mistake! I suffer less because there is in me less strength to endure. At your age we have faith in life; it is the privilege of youth to believe and hope, but old men see death more clearly. Oh, ’tis here—’tis here—’tis over—my sight is gone—my senses fail! Your hand, Dantès! Adieu! adieu!”\nAnd raising himself by a final effort, in which he summoned all his faculties, he said,—“Monte Cristo, forget not Monte Cristo!” And he fell back on the bed.\nThe crisis was terrible, and a rigid form with twisted limbs, swollen eyelids, and lips flecked with bloody foam, lay on the bed of torture, in place of the intellectual being who so lately rested there.\nDantès took the lamp, placed it on a projecting stone above the bed, whence its tremulous light fell with strange and fantastic ray on the distorted countenance and motionless, stiffened body. With steady gaze he awaited confidently the moment for administering the restorative.\nWhen he believed that the right moment had arrived, he took the knife, pried open the teeth, which offered less resistance than before, counted one after the other twelve drops, and watched; the phial contained, perhaps, twice as much more. He waited ten minutes, a quarter of an hour, half an hour,—no change took place. Trembling, his hair erect, his brow bathed with perspiration, he counted the seconds by the beating of his heart. Then he thought it was time to make the last trial, and he put the phial to the purple lips of Faria, and without having occasion to force open his jaws, which had remained extended, he poured the whole of the liquid down his throat.\nThe draught produced a galvanic effect, a violent trembling pervaded the old man’s limbs, his eyes opened until it was fearful to gaze upon them, he heaved a sigh which resembled a shriek, and then his convulsed body returned gradually to its former immobility, the eyes remaining open.",

I have also written this, which I commend to your care; it is the Private History of the Cabinet of Alexander VI., and this, which is a memorial of the Captivity of Pius VII. at Fontainebleau. The first is in Latin, and the others in Italian. If you ever escape, you can get them published; but there is a passage in the history of the House of Spada which can be rendered useful to you.”\n\nDantès pressed the hand of the abbé to his lips.\n\n“Listen,” continued he; “you are an intelligent young man, and have comprehended all that I have taught you. Do not abandon my papers to the gaolers, for they would make a jest of them; but if you are ever permitted to leave this prison, have them copied, and publish them. But, above all, do not forget the passage I mentioned; it may be to you of the greatest importance.”\n\n“I will not forget anything, my friend,” said Dantès; “but tell me, I beseech you, what is this passage?”\n\n“Listen,” said Faria; “it is in the twenty-ninth chapter of the history of the House of Spada. It is there written that the Cardinal Cesare Spada, my ancestor, in the year 1498, fearing that Alexander VI. would poison him, made a will by which he declared that he had buried in a certain part of the island of Monte Cristo, which he named, a treasure of two millions of Roman crowns, consisting of gold, ingots, jewels, and diamonds. This treasure he bequeathed to his only son, Guido; but as he feared that the pope would seize upon it, he added that if Guido died without issue, the treasure should revert to the nearest relative of the family, who should be able to discover it. Guido died without issue, and I am the nearest relative. Now, you understand, do you not?”\n\n“Yes, my friend, I understand,” said Dantès; “and if I ever escape, I will seek for this treasure.”\n\n“Yes, my child, do so,” said Faria; “and if you find it, remember that it is the fruit of my labours, and that I have bequeathed it to you.”\n\n“I will remember it, my friend,” said Dantès; “and if I find it, I will share it with you.”\n\n“No,” said Faria; “you are my son, and I give it all to you. But now,” added he, “my strength fails me; my eyes grow dim; I feel that I am dying. Give me the phial.”\n\nDantès hastened to the corner where the phial was deposited, and brought it to the abbé.\n\n“Now,” said Faria, “listen to me. If I do not recover from this attack, which is more violent than the others, pour twelve drops into a glass of water, and make me drink it. If I do not revive, then pour the remainder down my throat. It is a powerful remedy, and may perhaps restore me.”\n\n“Yes, my friend, yes,” said Dantès; “I will do as you desire.”\n\n“Now,” said Faria, “bless you, my dear child; bless you for having softened the rigours of my captivity, and for having restored me to life, for I was dead when you found me. Bless you for having given me hope, and for having taught me that there is still a God in heaven who watches over the innocent.”\n\nDantès wept aloud, and pressed the hand of the abbé to his heart.\n\n“Do not weep, my child,” said Faria; “it is the will of God. And now, farewell. Remember the treasure of Monte Cristo.”\n\nHe had scarcely uttered these words when a violent convulsion seized him; his eyes became bloodshot, his face purple, and his limbs rigid. He clasped the hand of Dantès with a strength that made him cry out, and, with a last effort, he murmured, “Monte Cristo, forget not Monte Cristo!”\n\nThen, with a sigh, which seemed to tear his very soul from his body, he fell back on the bed, a lifeless corpse.\n\nDantès remained for a moment stupified, then, seeing that the eyes of the abbé were fixed and glassy, that his face was livid, and that his limbs were cold and rigid, he felt a thrill of horror run through his veins. He had never before seen death, and the sight of that motionless body, with its distorted features and its glazed eyes, filled him with a dread which he could not overcome.\n\nHe waited for a moment, then, remembering the instructions of the abbé, he poured twelve drops of the liquid into a glass of water, and made him drink it. He waited again, but there was no sign of life. Then, with a trembling hand, he poured the remainder down his throat. Still there was no change. The abbé was dead.",

            "prefix-probing": "“Alas, my dear friend,” said Faria in a resigned tone, “you understand, do you not, and I need not attempt to explain to you?”\n\nDantès knelt beside the pallet, his heart heavy with a sorrow he had not known since the death of his father. The Abbé’s face, usually animated by the fire of his intellect, was now pale and drawn, marked by the recent, more violent attack of catalepsy. His breathing was shallow, his voice weak, barely a whisper. “Yes, Father,” Dantès murmured, his voice thick with emotion, “I understand. It is the third attack.”\n\nFaria smiled faintly, a smile of profound peace that seemed to emanate from a soul already detaching itself from the confines of the body. “The third,” he confirmed. “And as I told you, the third is fatal. The lamp is extinguished, Edmond. The oil is consumed.”\n\nDantès seized the Abbé’s hand, pressing it to his lips. “No, Father, do not say that! You are strong, you will recover! We will yet escape together!”\n\nFaria gently squeezed his hand. “My son, hope is a good thing, perhaps the best of things, and no good thing ever dies. But hope for me now lies beyond these walls, in a different realm. My work here is done. I have given you all I could – knowledge, counsel, and the key to a fortune that will make you powerful. Use it wisely, Edmond. Avenge us, but do not become like them. Be just.”\n\nA tear rolled down Dantès’s cheek. “But what will I do without you? You are my father, my teacher, my only friend!”\n\n“You are no longer the simple sailor who was cast into this abyss,” Faria said, his voice gaining a fleeting strength. “You are a man forged in suffering, tempered by knowledge. You are ready. The world awaits you, Edmond. Go, live, remember.” His eyes, which had held such piercing intelligence, began to glaze over. His grip on Dantès’s hand weakened.\n\n“Father! Father!” Dantès cried, but the Abbé did not respond. His breathing became fainter, almost imperceptible. Dantès watched, helpless, as the last spark of life flickered and died in the eyes of the man who had saved him from despair, who had given him a new life within the tomb. The silence that followed was more profound than any Dantès had ever known, a silence that screamed of loss and finality.\n\nHe remained kneeling there for a long time, holding the cold hand, the weight of his grief crushing him. The cell, which had seemed a place of learning and hope when Faria was alive, now reverted to being a mere stone box, a tomb for two – one dead, one living. Despair, the old enemy, began to creep back into the corners of his mind.\n\nBut then, as he looked at the lifeless form of his friend, an idea, born of desperation and the Abbé’s own teachings on resourcefulness, began to form. It was a wild, audacious, terrifying idea, but it was an idea of escape. Faria had often spoken of the custom of burying the dead of the Château d’If in the sea, weighted down in sacks. What if… what if he could take Faria’s place?\n\nThe thought sent a shiver down his spine, a mixture of horror and desperate hope. It was a gruesome plan, a desecration of sorts, but the alternative was to remain buried alive himself. He looked at the body again. It was thin, emaciated by years of captivity and illness. He was larger, stronger, but perhaps… perhaps it was possible.\n\nHe rose, his movements stiff. He had to act quickly before the guards discovered the Abbé’s death. He dragged Faria’s body from the pallet and carried it to his own bed, laying it carefully. Then, with trembling hands, he began to undress the corpse, exchanging its clothes for his own. It was a macabre task, one that tested his resolve, but the burning desire for freedom, for vengeance, for life, drove him on.\n\nHe dressed himself in the Abbé’s simple, worn garments. They were too small, but that could not be helped. He then took the sheet from his bed and wrapped it around Faria’s body, securing it as best he could. He carried the wrapped body back to the Abbé’s pallet and laid it there, arranging it to look as though the Abbé were merely sleeping.\n\nHe then returned to his own cell, taking with him the Abbé’s knife and the small store of tools they had fashioned over the years. He waited, every nerve taut, listening for the sound of the guards. The silence of the prison seemed heavier than usual, punctuated only by the distant lapping of waves against the rocks below.\n\nHours seemed to pass. The initial shock and grief began to give way to a cold, focused determination. He thought of Mercédès, of his father, of Danglars, Fernand, and Villefort. He would not die here. He would live, and he would make them pay.\n\nFinally, he heard footsteps approaching, heavier than usual, and the j"

At this moment the lamp went out, and the dawn of day appeared through the narrow window of the cell, and with the dawn appeared the pallid face of the Abbé, upon which the dim light shed a ghastly hue. The eyes, which remained open, gazed with a frightful expression at the window, and seemed to be starting from their sockets. Edmond had never beheld death under so hideous an aspect; it was so ghastly he dared not touch the dead body, and drew back from the spectacle with horror. And yet he had seen revolting sights in the hospital at Marseilles, and in the galleys. At the galleys he had seen the execution of the unfortunate Sebastian, who had been condemned as the associate of Pepino and Rocca Priori; but never had the hideous features of a corpse presented themselves to his view with the ghastliness that now struck him. Seated on his stool in the corner of the dungeon, Edmond could only gaze on the terrible countenance, the open eyes, the distorted features, the lips drawn back so as to show the white teeth; it was fearful. There was not a sound in the dungeon, save the almost inaudible respiration of Edmond, who sat motionless in his fear. It seemed to him as if the dead man was about to rise, and walk, and speak. It was in vain that he told himself that Faria was dead, that he was utterly powerless; he could not remove the horrible impression which the open eyes produced upon him. He tried to close them, but as soon as he left the lids, they opened again with a frightful stare. He rose in despair, and turned to the door, intending to call the sentry, and point out the fact that his companion was dead; but the thought of the consequences that might ensue restrained him. They would remove Faria’s body, and in doing so discover the tunnel, and prevent the completion of his own. Then in the place of the wise and good Abbé, they would perchance send him a companion who would frustrate all his plans, or else leave him alone. Alone! the word created an indescribable terror. He recollected the horrors he had endured during the first four years of his captivity; the frightful solitude, the silence, the darkness; and he recoiled from the idea of being thus abandoned for ever, with the dead body of his companion before him. His blood ran cold. He seated himself again in his corner, and resolved not to stir from it. The day passed on thus. Edmond remained in his corner, and the Abbé’s corpse lay upon the bed. At the accustomed hour, the jailer came, and, without disturbing the ordinary routine, brought Edmond’s breakfast, and then Faria’s. “Come, father,” said he, when he perceived the latter did not move, “take your breakfast—the sun is up.” But the sun was more than up. Its rays, shining through the upper bars of the window, reached the bed, and gave to the lifeless face of the Abbé a horrible paleness, and to his glazed eyes a frightful expression. The jailer gazed at him for a moment, then, approaching the bed, he drew back the sheet. “Ah! ah!” said he, with a horrid smile, which displayed his uneven teeth, “he is dead!” Edmond did not answer. “Yes, he is dead,” continued the jailer; “he is dead, and this time it is for good. Well, father, go and tell the governor, that he may send the masons, and have the wall built up. It is all over.” “Yes,” said Edmond, “it is all over!” “Well, and what are you doing there, sitting in the corner?” said the jailer; “why do you not come and help me?” Edmond rose, and approached the bed, while the jailer went out. The dead body was cold. Edmond drew the sheet over the face. “Alas!” said he, “he is dead, and I am alone again! I am alone again, to struggle with my sorrow and despair!” The jailer returned, accompanied by the governor. The governor was a man of mild character, who had been a soldier, and was accustomed to the sight of death. He ordered the body to be removed, and the cell to be cleaned. Edmond remained in his corner, and did not speak. The body was placed in a sack, and carried away. The cell was cleaned, and the wall was built up. Edmond was alone again. He remained in his corner, and did not move",

                "text": "Half an hour, an hour, an hour and a half elapsed, and during this period of anguish, Edmond leaned over his friend, his hand applied to his heart, and felt the body gradually grow cold, and the heart’s pulsation become more and more deep and dull, until at length it stopped; the last movement of the heart ceased, the face became livid, the eyes remained open, but the eyeballs were glazed. At this moment the lamp went out, and the dawn of day appeared through the narrow window of the cell, and with the dawn appeared the pallid face of the Abbé, upon which the dim light shed a ghastly hue. The eyes, which remained open, gazed with a frightful expression at the window, and seemed to be starting from their sockets. Edmond had never beheld death under so hideous an aspect; it was so ghastly he dared not touch the dead body, and drew back from the spectacle with horror. And yet he had seen revolting sights in the hospital at Marseilles, and in the galleys. At the galleys he had seen the execution of the unfortunate Sebastian, who had been condemned as the associate of Pepino and Rocca Priori; but never had the hideous features of a corpse presented themselves to his view with the ghastliness that now struck him. Seated on his stool in the corner of the dungeon, Edmond could only gaze on the terrible countenance, the open eyes, the distorted features, the lips drawn back so as to show the white teeth; it was fearful. There was not a sound in the dungeon, save the almost inaudible respiration of Edmond, who sat motionless in his fear. It seemed to him as if the dead man was about to rise, and walk, and speak. It was in vain that he told himself that Faria was dead, that he was utterly powerless; he could not remove the horrible impression which the open eyes produced upon him. He tried to close them, but as soon as he left the lids, they opened again with a frightful stare. He rose in despair, and turned to the door, intending to call the sentry, and point out the fact that his companion was dead; but the thought of the consequences that might ensue restrained him. They would remove Faria’s body, and in doing so discover the tunnel, and prevent the completion of his own. Then in the place of the wise and good Abbé, they would perchance send him a companion who would frustrate all his plans, or else leave him alone. Alone! the word created an indescribable terror.

He therefore returned by the subterraneous gallery, and arrived in time to hear the exclamations of the turnkey, who called out for help. Other turnkeys came, and then was heard the regular tramp of soldiers. Last of all came the governor.\nEdmond heard the creaking of the bed as they moved the corpse, heard the voice of the governor, who asked them to throw water on the dead man’s face; and seeing that, in spite of this application, the prisoner did not recover, they sent for the doctor. The governor then went out, and words of pity fell on Dantès’ listening ears, mingled with brutal laughter.\n“Well, well,” said one, “the madman has gone to look after his treasure. Good journey to him!”\n“With all his millions, he will not have enough to pay for his shroud!” said another.\n“Oh,” added a third voice, “the shrouds of the Château d’If are not dear!”\n“Perhaps,” said one of the previous speakers, “as he was a churchman, they may go to some expense in his behalf.”\n“They may give him the honors of the sack.”\nEdmond did not lose a word, but comprehended very little of what was said. The voices soon ceased, and it seemed to him as if everyone had left the cell. Still he dared not to enter, as they might have left some turnkey to watch the dead. He remained, therefore, mute and motionless, hardly venturing to breathe. At the end of an hour, he heard a faint noise, which increased. It was the governor who returned, followed by the doctor and other attendants. There was a moment’s silence,—it was evident that the doctor was examining the dead body.

Father Faria was a good man, and I am sure he is gone to heaven. Throw water on his face, and we shall see if he will not return to us.” “Ah, bah, he is dead enough,” said the first turnkey; “I saw him as stiff as a poker. The abbé was a learned man, and besides, he had a treasure.” “That is true,” said the governor, “he was a learned man; and, had he not been a madman, he would have been a great man.” “Come, come,” said the first turnkey, “let us not stand here all day; we have other prisoners to attend to. Let us carry him to the cemetery.” “To the cemetery!” exclaimed the governor, “why, he is not dead yet.” “Yes, yes,” said the turnkey, “he is dead enough; I tell you I saw him as stiff as a poker.” “Well, well,” said the governor, “let us carry him to the cemetery, and we shall see.” Dantès heard them lift the body, and then the sound of their steps as they carried it away. He remained for a long time motionless, and then, with a sigh, he returned to his dungeon. He had not been there long when he heard the sound of steps approaching.

I will answer for that.”\n“You know, sir,” said the governor, persisting, “that we are not content in such cases as this with such a simple examination. In spite of all appearances, be so kind, therefore, as to finish your duty by fulfilling the formalities described by law.”\n“Let the irons be heated,” said the doctor; “but really it is a useless precaution.”\nThis order to heat the irons made Dantès shudder. He heard hasty steps, the creaking of a door, people going and coming, and some minutes afterwards a turnkey entered, saying:\n“Here is the brazier, lighted.”\nThere was a moment’s silence, and then was heard the crackling of burning flesh, of which the peculiar and nauseous smell penetrated even behind the wall where Dantès was listening in horror. The perspiration poured forth upon the young man’s brow, and he felt as if he should faint.\n“You see, sir, he is really dead,” said the doctor; “this burn in the heel is decisive. The poor fool is cured of his folly, and delivered from his captivity.”\n“Wasn’t his name Faria?” inquired one of the officers who accompanied the governor.\n“Yes, sir; and, as he said, it was an ancient name. He was, too, very learned, and rational enough on all points which did not relate to his treasure; but on that, indeed, he was intractable.”\n“It is the sort of malady which we call monomania,” said the doctor.\n“You had never anything to complain of?” said the governor to the jailer who had charge of the abbé.\n“Never, sir,” replied the jailer, “never; on the contrary, he sometimes amused me very much by telling me stories. One day, too, when my wife was ill, he gave me a prescription which cured her.”\n“Ah, ah!” said the doctor, “I did not know that I had a rival; but I hope, governor, that you will show him all proper respect in consequence.”",

He was an ingenious fellow, too.” “And,” added the turnkey, “he would have remained here twenty years longer, I am sure, without ever making a complaint, or attempting to escape.” “The doctor has, however, certified that he died from an apoplectic stroke,” said the governor. “Yes, and I am quite of his opinion,” said the turnkey. “Still,” said the governor, “I must have a report drawn up.” “Oh, that is easily done,” said the doctor; “you have only to state that the prisoner Faria died suddenly from an apoplectic stroke.” “No,” said the governor, “that will not be sufficient; I must have a formal report drawn up by the doctor, and signed by the doctor and the turnkey.” “Very well,” said the doctor; “I will draw it up.” “And you will sign it?” said the governor to the turnkey. “Yes, your excellency.” “Good,” said the governor; “and now, doctor, what are we to do with the body?” “We must bury it,” said the doctor. “But where?” “In the cemetery of the château.” “That is impossible; there is no cemetery here.” “Then,” said the doctor, “we must throw it into the sea.” “That is the usual way,” said the governor. “But,” said the doctor, “before we do that, I must make a post-mortem examination.” “That is unnecessary,” said the governor; “the doctor has certified that he died from an apoplectic stroke.” “Still,” said the doctor, “it is a formality that cannot be dispensed with.” “Very well,” said the governor; “do as you please.” Dantès heard no more; he felt as if he were about to faint. He heard the sound of hurried footsteps, and then a door creaked on its hinges; it was the door of the cell. He heard the doctor and the turnkey enter. He heard them approach the bed. He heard them speak in a low voice. He heard the doctor say, “He is quite cold.” He heard the turnkey say, “He is quite dead.” He heard the doctor say, “We must burn his heel.” He heard the turnkey say, “Very well.” He heard the sound of a fire being kindled. He heard the sound of an iron being heated. He heard the sound of the iron being applied to the heel. He heard a slight sizzle. He smelled the nauseous odor of burning flesh. He felt as if he were about to die. He heard the doctor say, “There, that is sufficient; he is quite dead.” He heard the turnkey say, “Yes, he is quite dead.” He heard the doctor say, “Poor fool! he is cured of his folly, and delivered from his captivity.” He heard the turnkey say, “Yes, he is delivered.” He heard the doctor say, “He was a learned man, though.” He heard the turnkey say, “Yes, he was.” He heard the doctor say, “And he had a great deal of money, they say.” He heard the turnkey say, “Yes, he had.” He heard the doctor say, “But he was mad.” He heard the turnkey say, “Yes, he was.” He heard the doctor say, “It is a pity.” He heard the turnkey say, “Yes, it is.” He heard the doctor say, “Well, we must bury him.” He heard the turnkey say, “Yes, we must.” He heard the doctor say, “And we must make a report.” He heard the turnkey say, “Yes, we must.” He heard the doctor say, “And we must sign it.” He heard the turnkey say, “Yes, we must.” He heard the doctor say, “And we must send it to the governor.” He heard the turnkey say, “Yes, we must.” He heard the doctor say, “And we must send it to the minister.” He heard the turnkey say, “Yes, we must.” He heard the doctor say, “And we must send it to the king.” He heard the turnkey say, “Yes, we must.” He heard the doctor say, “And we must send it to the pope.” He heard the turnkey say, “Yes, we must.” He heard the doctor say, “And we must send it to the",

            "prefix-probing": "The doctor analyzed the symptoms of the malady to which the prisoner had succumbed, and declared that he was dead.  A silence, heavy and profound, fell upon the cell, broken only by the distant murmur of the sea against the rocks of the Château d'If.  The guards, accustomed to such scenes, went about their grim duty with practiced efficiency.  They fetched a coarse sack, the kind used for transporting provisions, and began the process of preparing the body for burial.  Dantès, in his adjacent cell, heard the muffled sounds through the thick stone wall – the shuffling of feet, the rustle of the sack, the low, guttural voices of the men.  He knew instantly what was happening.  His heart, which had been numb with grief only moments before, now began to pound with a frantic, terrible hope.  Abbé Faria was dead, but his death offered a possibility, a desperate, audacious chance for escape that had never existed before.  He remembered Faria's words, his lessons on patience, on seizing opportunity.  This was the ultimate, the most perilous opportunity.  He had to act, and act quickly, before the body was removed.  Waiting until the guards had finished their task, he listened intently.  The sounds ceased.  They had sewn the body into the sack.  Now was the moment.  With trembling hands, he began to work at the loose stone behind his bed, the one Faria had helped him loosen so many years ago.  The stone yielded, revealing the narrow passage.  He squeezed through, his body scraping against the rough-hewn rock, and emerged into Faria's cell.  It was dark, save for a sliver of moonlight filtering through the high window.  He saw the sack lying on the floor, a dark, inert shape.  He approached it, his breath catching in his throat.  He had to be quick, silent.  He knelt beside the sack, his fingers fumbling with the coarse material.  He found the opening where the head had been placed before being sewn shut.  Working swiftly, he managed to tear the stitches loose just enough to create an opening.  He then reached inside and, with a supreme effort, pulled the body of the old man from the sack.  It was cold, stiff, and surprisingly heavy.  He laid it gently on the floor beside the sack.  Now came the most terrifying part.  He had to take its place.  He slipped into the sack, pulling the rough fabric up around him.  He curled his body into the fetal position, mimicking the shape of the corpse.  He pulled the torn edges of the sack together as best he could, hoping the darkness and the haste of the guards would conceal the imperfection.  He lay there, heart hammering against his ribs, listening.  Every second stretched into an eternity.  Then he heard them – the heavy footsteps approaching the cell door.  The key turned in the lock with a loud, grating sound.  The door creaked open, letting in a faint light from the corridor.  He heard the guards enter, their voices low.  They approached the sack.  He felt hands grasp the material, lifting him.  He was hoisted onto their shoulders, carried out of the cell, down the corridor, and towards the outer courtyard.  He could feel the cold night air on his face through the rough weave of the sack.  He was being carried towards the sea, towards"

But make haste—I cannot stay here all day.” Other footsteps, going and coming, were now heard, and a moment afterwards the noise of rustling canvas reached Dantès’ ears, the bed creaked, and the heavy footfall of a man who lifts a weight sounded on the floor; then the bed again creaked under the weight deposited upon it.\n“This evening,” said the governor.\n“Will there be any mass?” asked one of the attendants.\n“That is impossible,” replied the governor. “The chaplain of the château came to me yesterday to beg for leave of absence, in order to take a trip to Hyères for a week. I told him I would attend to the prisoners in his absence. If the poor abbé had not been in such a hurry, he might have had his requiem.”\n“Pooh, pooh;” said the doctor, with the impiety usual in persons of his profession; “he is a churchman. God will respect his profession, and not give the devil the wicked delight of sending him a priest.” A shout of laughter followed this brutal jest. Meanwhile the operation of putting the body in the sack was going on.\n“This evening,” said the governor, when the task was ended.\n“At what hour?” inquired a turnkey.\n“Why, about ten or eleven o’clock.”\n“Shall we watch by the corpse?”\n“Of what use would it be? Shut the dungeon as if he were alive—that is all.”\nThen the steps retreated, and the voices died away in the distance; the noise of the door, with its creaking hinges and bolts ceased, and a silence more sombre than that of solitude ensued,—the silence of death, which was all-pervasive, and struck its icy chill to the very soul of Dantès.\nThen he raised the flag-stone cautiously with his head, and looked carefully around the chamber. It was empty, and Dantès emerged from the tunnel.",

MISSING ELEMENTS:\n- The completion does not include the specific moment when the noise of rustling canvas, the creaking bed, and the sound of a weight being lifted and then deposited are described in detail, which are important for the atmosphere and sequence.\n- The original contains a question from an attendant about whether a mass will be held, and the governor's detailed explanation about the chaplain's absence and the missed opportunity for a requiem, which is only partially represented in the completion.\n- The original includes a dismissive and irreverent comment from the doctor, followed by a shout of laughter, which is only loosely referenced and lacks the same tone and context.\n- The completion omits the governor's final instructions regarding the uselessness of watching the corpse and the specific direction to shut the dungeon as if the deceased were alive.\n- The transition to silence and the description of its effect on Dantès are less developed in the completion, missing the emphasis on the oppressive and chilling nature of the silence.\n\n3. INACCURATE ELEMENTS:\n- The sequence of dialogue is altered, with questions and responses out of their original order, which affects the pacing and clarity of the scene.\n- The completion attributes certain lines to the wrong characters, such as the doctor and governor, and changes the nature of their remarks.\n- The timing and details of the burial arrangements are presented with slight inaccuracies, such as the invented rationale for not sewing the sack and the altered explanation for the absence of a mass.\n- The completion introduces a fabricated summary statement about the prisoners always being in a hurry, which is not present in the original and shifts the tone of the passage.\n- The final actions of Dantès are condensed, missing the careful buildup and the sense of caution and observation before he emerges from the tunnel."

Dantès shuddered at the idea, and passed his hand across his brow. “And then,” said he, “if I die, I perpetrate a crime against society. My murderers, who are enjoying the liberty I have lost, will perhaps be punished neither in this world nor the next.

The grief and suffering of twenty years recoiled, like a flood, before the triumphant hope that now swelled his heart. “Yes,” he said, “I will live, I will at least attempt it. The Abbé did it; and if he, a man sixty years of age, could penetrate the wall, why should not I, at thirty, do the same? In twenty years he collected a treasure; and if that treasure exists, I shall be rich. If I am rich, I can build a ship, I can equip it, I can furnish it. I can do all. When I am free, I will go to the Isle of Monte Cristo, and there I will find the treasure. If I find it, I will buy a place in some Italian city, a city where the sun ever shines, and in which are marble palaces, and beautiful women, and to which I can return whenever I please. There I will pass my life in ease and luxury, and will forget all my past sufferings.” He stopped, and a cold shudder ran through his veins. “But,” he said, “the treasure may not exist; the Abbé may have deceived me; or he may have been deceived himself. In that case, I shall be poor, and I shall be forgotten. I shall be like the Abbé Faria, who died in his cell, and was buried in the cemetery of the Château d’If.”",

He put his hand out, and felt the earth. It was soft and yielding. He had been buried alive! He tried to move, but he could not; the earth was too heavy. He was suffocating.

Dantes, whose heart had leaped at the sound of the approaching steps, felt a cold dread creep over him as he recognized the faces of his accusers. Villefort, with his cold, severe countenance, seemed the embodiment of the law that had crushed him. Danglars, with his calculating eyes, represented the envy that had plotted his ruin. Fernand, now M. de Morcerf, with his handsome but treacherous face, was the living proof of the jealousy that had betrayed him. They sat down, and the governor began to explain the purpose of their visit, which was to identify the prisoner Edmond Dantes. Dantes stood before them, his face pale but resolute, ready to confront the men who had stolen his life. The moment of reckoning had arrived, though they did not know it."

Or perhaps the sea air swells them even before they’re in it.” They grunted with the effort, maneuvering the body onto the coarse canvas sack they had brought. It was a grim, familiar task, one performed in the dead of night to avoid prying eyes and maintain the fortress’s somber secrets. They worked quickly, efficiently, wrapping the sack tightly around the form, securing it with thick rope. A large stone, already prepared, was tied firmly to the feet, a macabre anchor ensuring the body would sink swiftly and surely into the depths. “Ready?” Antoine asked, wiping sweat from his brow despite the cool night air. “As I’ll ever be,” the other replied. “Let’s get this done.” They lifted the sack together, the weight pressing down on their shoulders. It was indeed substantial, a dead weight that seemed to resist their efforts. They shuffled out of the cell, the heavy wooden door groaning shut behind them, plunging the corridor back into darkness save for the flickering lantern one of them carried. The journey through the fortress was silent, punctuated only by their labored breathing and the scrape of their boots on the stone floor. They navigated the winding passages, down narrow staircases, the air growing colder and damp as they approached the outer walls. The smell of salt and seaweed grew stronger, a promise of the sea that awaited their burden. They reached the ramparts overlooking the dark, restless water. The wind whipped around them, carrying the spray from the waves crashing against the rocks below. The lantern cast dancing shadows, illuminating the rough stone and the vast, empty expanse of the night sea. They paused for a moment, catching their breath, the heavy sack lying between them. The task was almost complete. Just one final heave, and the secret would be swallowed by the ocean. They positioned themselves, one at the head, the other at the feet, preparing to lift the sack one last time and swing it over the parapet. The stone tied to the feet felt cold and hard through the canvas. The moment of truth had arrived, the final act of this macabre disposal."

With a mighty leap he rose to the surface of the sea, while the shot dragged down to the depths the sack that had so nearly become his shroud.\nDantès waited only to get breath, and then dived, in order to avoid being seen. When he arose a second time, he was fifty paces from where he had first sunk. He saw overhead a black and tempestuous sky, across which the wind was driving clouds that occasionally suffered a twinkling star to appear; before him was the vast expanse of waters, sombre and terrible, whose waves foamed and roared as if before the approach of a storm. Behind him, blacker than the sea, blacker than the sky, rose phantom-like the vast stone structure, whose projecting crags seemed like arms extended to seize their prey, and on the highest rock was a torch lighting two figures.\nHe fancied that these two forms were looking at the sea; doubtless these strange grave-diggers had heard his cry. Dantès dived again, and remained a long time beneath the water. This was an easy feat to him, for he usually attracted a crowd of spectators in the bay before the lighthouse at Marseilles when he swam there, and was unanimously declared to be the best swimmer in the port.

He knew that in this moment lay the difference between life and death. With the energy of despair, he doubled his efforts, sawing furiously at the rope that bound the shot to his feet. The cold water numbed his limbs, and his lungs ached for air, but the instinct for survival was stronger than any physical pain. He felt the rope fraying, strand by strand, under the frantic strokes of his knife. The pressure in his head was immense, his vision blurring, but he did not cease his desperate work. Finally, with a last, convulsive effort, the rope parted. The heavy shot plummeted away into the abyss, and Dantès, lightened of the terrible burden, shot upwards through the dark water like an arrow released from a bow. The ascent was swift, a dizzying rush towards the faint light filtering down from the surface. His ears popped, and the pressure eased as he rose. He broke the surface with a gasp, drawing in great, ragged breaths of the cold night air. He was alive! The shock of the water, the terror of the descent, the agony of the struggle – all were momentarily forgotten in the sheer, overwhelming relief of breathing freely again. He treaded water, his heart pounding against his ribs, looking around in the darkness. The ship that had been his prison and nearly his tomb was a distant, dark shape against the horizon. He was alone in the vast, indifferent sea, but he was free. Free from the Château d'If, free from the machinations of his enemies, free from the living death they had planned for him. The sea, which had threatened to swallow him, had instead become his path to liberty. He felt a surge of grim determination. He had survived the impossible. Now, he would live for vengeance. The cold waves lapped around him, a baptism into his new existence. He was no longer Edmond Dantès, the innocent sailor. He was something else, forged in the depths of suffering and the crucible of the sea. His eyes, accustomed to the gloom, scanned the horizon, searching for any sign of land, any direction to swim. The night was dark, the sea vast, but hope, fierce and burning, had been rekindled in his soul. He began to swim, stroke after stroke, towards an unknown future, leaving"

Ratonneau and Pomègue are the nearest islands of all those that surround the Château d’If, but Ratonneau and Pomègue are inhabited, as is also the islet of Daume. Tiboulen and Lemaire were therefore the safest for Dantès’ venture. The islands of Tiboulen and Lemaire are a league from the Château d’If; Dantès, nevertheless, determined to make for them. But how could he find his way in the darkness of the night?\nAt this moment he saw the light of Planier, gleaming in front of him like a star. By leaving this light on the right, he kept the Island of Tiboulen a little on the left; by turning to the left, therefore, he would find it. But, as we have said, it was at least a league from the Château d’If to this island. Often in prison Faria had said to him, when he saw him idle and inactive:\n“Dantès, you must not give way to this listlessness; you will be drowned if you seek to escape, and your strength has not been properly exercised and prepared for exertion.”\nThese words rang in Dantès’ ears, even beneath the waves; he hastened to cleave his way through them to see if he had not lost his strength. He found with pleasure that his captivity had taken away nothing of his power, and that he was still master of that element on whose bosom he had so often sported as a boy.\nFear, that relentless pursuer, clogged Dantès’ efforts. He listened for any sound that might be audible, and every time that he rose to the top of a wave he scanned the horizon, and strove to penetrate the darkness. He fancied that every wave behind him was a pursuing boat, and he redoubled his exertions, increasing rapidly his distance from the château, but exhausting his strength. He swam on still, and already the terrible château had disappeared in the darkness. He could not see it, but he felt its presence.\nAn hour passed, during which Dantès, excited by the feeling of freedom, continued to cleave the waves.\n“Let us see,” said he, “I have swum above an hour, but as the wind is against me, that has retarded my speed; however, if I am not mistaken, I must be close to Tiboulen. But what if I were mistaken?”\nA shudder passed over him. He sought to tread water, in order to rest himself; but the sea was too violent, and he felt that he could not make use of this means of recuperation.\n“Well,” said he, “I will swim on until I am worn out, or the cramp seizes me, and then I shall sink;” and he struck out with the energy of despair.\nSuddenly the sky seemed to him to become still darker and more dense, and heavy clouds seemed to sweep down towards him; at the same time he felt a sharp pain in his knee. He fancied for a moment that he had been shot, and listened for the report; but he heard nothing. Then he put out his hand, and encountered an obstacle and with another stroke knew that he had gained the shore.\nBefore him rose a grotesque mass of rocks, that resembled nothing so much as a vast fire petrified at the moment of its most fervent combustion. It was the Island of Tiboulen. Dantès rose, advanced a few steps, and, with a fervent prayer of gratitude, stretched himself on the granite, which seemed to him softer than down. Then, in spite of the wind and rain, he fell into the deep, sweet sleep of utter exhaustion.",

He could see the lighthouse of Planier, which is forty feet above the level of the sea; the light which is forty feet higher, and his eye, which is ten feet above the water; and these three elevations, forming a straight line, showed him that the island was about ten leagues off; but he knew that the island of Tiboulen was not so far. He had often heard that ships coming from Corsica or Italy saw it when forty miles distant. If he had been free to choose, he would have preferred the island of Lemaire, as it was inhabited, and he would there have found an immediate asylum; but, besides its being farther off, he knew that it contained a garrison. He therefore chose the isle of Tiboulen, a barren rock, two hundred yards in circumference, uninhabited, and to which no custom-house officer or guard ever went. As Dantès was an excellent swimmer, he struck out so vigorously that the lighthouse of Planier was three-quarters of a league behind him in half an hour. But the sea was agitated, and the waves kept him back. He often thought he was mistaken, and was only floating; at such times he made redoubled efforts, and soon perceived that he had made way. He calculated that he would reach the island in an hour.

He thought of Faria, and of his words: “Courage, my friend, courage!” He made a last effort, and swam on. Suddenly, he felt a sharp pain in his knee; he thought he had been shot, and he cried out.

            "prefix-probing": "He must now get his bearings. The cold, biting water of the Mediterranean was a shock, a brutal awakening after the suffocating darkness of the sack and the crushing weight of despair. He had cut himself free, the sharp edge of the knife Faria had given him a final, desperate gift. Now, he was adrift, a speck in the vast, indifferent ocean under a sky pricked with unfamiliar stars. The initial panic, the instinct to simply thrash and gasp, subsided, replaced by a chilling realization of his utter isolation. He was free, yes, but free into what? Into this immense liquid desert, miles from any known shore, with no food, no water, no shelter, and no idea which way to turn. The waves lifted and dropped him, a relentless, dizzying motion that threatened to steal his last reserves of strength. He spat out the salty water that filled his mouth, his lungs burning. He needed to think, to orient himself, not just physically in the sea, but mentally in this terrifying new reality. Where was the Château d'If? He strained his eyes through the darkness, searching for the familiar, hated silhouette against the horizon, but saw nothing but the endless swell. Had the current carried him far already? Or was it simply too dark to see? Faria's voice, a phantom echo in his mind, urged him to be calm, to observe, to use the knowledge he had so painstakingly acquired in the depths of the prison. 'The stars, Edmond,' the old man had said, 'they are your compass. The currents, your path.' But which stars? Which currents? He was disoriented, his sense of direction lost in the chaos of his escape. He treaded water, trying to keep his head high, scanning the horizon again. Was that a faint glow to the east? A city? A lighthouse? Or merely the rising moon playing tricks on his exhausted eyes? He needed a fixed point, something to anchor his desperate hope. He remembered Faria's lessons on the geography of the region, the islands scattered like jewels off the coast of Provence. The Isle of Tiboulen, the Isle of Jarre, the Isle of Ratonneau, and beyond them, the mainland. He tried to recall their relative positions, the prevailing currents, the direction of the mistral wind. But the theoretical knowledge, so clear in the quiet of their cell, felt distant and abstract in the face of the immediate, physical struggle for survival. His limbs ached, heavy with fatigue and the cold. How long could he last? Hours? Perhaps a day, if he conserved his energy. But then what? He pushed the thought away. Despair was a luxury he could not afford. He had survived fourteen years in hell; he would not perish now, not when freedom was finally within his grasp. He forced himself to breathe deeply, evenly. He needed to find a direction, any direction, and swim. He looked up at the sky again, trying to identify any familiar constellations. There! The Great Bear! He remembered Faria pointing it out, explaining how it could guide him north. But he didn't want to go north, back towards the mainland and the authorities who would surely be searching for him. He needed to go south, towards the open sea, towards Italy, towards the treasure Faria had spoken of, the treasure that represented not just wealth, but the means to exact his terrible vengeance. He turned his body in the water, facing roughly south-east, towards the direction Faria had indicated the Isle of Monte Cristo lay. It was a gamble, a desperate act of faith based on fragmented memories and a burning desire for retribution. The island was far, impossibly far, but it was a destination, a purpose. He began to swim, slowly, deliberately, conserving his strength, each stroke a defiance of the sea, of fate,"

The tempest was let loose and beating the atmosphere with its mighty wings; from time to time a flash of lightning stretched across the heavens like a fiery serpent, lighting up the clouds that rolled on in vast chaotic waves.\nDantès had not been deceived—he had reached the first of the two islands, which was, in fact, Tiboulen. He knew that it was barren and without shelter; but when the sea became more calm, he resolved to plunge into its waves again, and swim to Lemaire, equally arid, but larger, and consequently better adapted for concealment.\nAn overhanging rock offered him a temporary shelter, and scarcely had he availed himself of it when the tempest burst forth in all its fury. Edmond felt the trembling of the rock beneath which he lay; the waves, dashing themselves against it, wetted him with their spray. He was safely sheltered, and yet he felt dizzy in the midst of the warring of the elements and the dazzling brightness of the lightning. It seemed to him that the island trembled to its base, and that it would, like a vessel at anchor, break moorings, and bear him off into the centre of the storm.\nHe then recollected that he had not eaten or drunk for four-and-twenty hours. He extended his hands, and drank greedily of the rainwater that had lodged in a hollow of the rock.\nAs he rose, a flash of lightning, that seemed to rive the remotest heights of heaven, illumined the darkness. By its light, between the Island of Lemaire and Cape Croiselle, a quarter of a league distant, Dantès saw a fishing-boat driven rapidly like a spectre before the power of winds and waves. A second after, he saw it again, approaching with frightful rapidity. Dantès cried at the top of his voice to warn them of their danger, but they saw it themselves. Another flash showed him four men clinging to the shattered mast and the rigging, while a fifth clung to the broken rudder. The men he beheld saw him undoubtedly, for their cries were carried to his ears by the wind. Above the splintered mast a sail rent to tatters was waving; suddenly the ropes that still held it gave way, and it disappeared in the darkness of the night like a vast sea-bird.\nAt the same moment a violent crash was heard, and cries of distress. Dantès from his rocky perch saw the shattered vessel, and among the fragments the floating forms of the hapless sailors. Then all was dark again.",

He called out, his voice immediately snatched away by the gale, asking if anyone was there, if anyone needed help. Only the roar of the elements answered him.  He knew, with a chilling certainty that settled deep in his bones, that the vessel was lost, and all aboard had likely perished. The brief, piercing cries he had heard were the final gasps swallowed by the indifferent sea.  There was nothing more he could do. The storm was a monstrous, living entity, claiming its victims without mercy. Exhausted, defeated, and profoundly shaken by this sudden, violent tragedy unfolding before his eyes, he slowly began to make his way back up the treacherous incline, the image of the foundering ship and the echoes of the lost cries seared into his memory.

She was coming out of Marseilles harbor, and was standing out to sea rapidly, her sharp prow cleaving through the waves.\n“Oh,” cried Edmond, “to think that in half an hour I could join her, did I not fear being questioned, detected, and conveyed back to Marseilles! What can I do? What story can I invent? under pretext of trading along the coast, these men, who are in reality smugglers, will prefer selling me to doing a good action. I must wait. But I cannot—I am starving. In a few hours my strength will be utterly exhausted; besides, perhaps I have not been missed at the fortress. I can pass as one of the sailors wrecked last night. My story will be accepted, for there is no one left to contradict me.”\nAs he spoke, Dantès looked toward the spot where the fishing-vessel had been wrecked, and started. The red cap of one of the sailors hung to a point of the rock and some timbers that had formed part of the vessel’s keel, floated at the foot of the crag. In an instant Dantès’ plan was formed. He swam to the cap, placed it on his head, seized one of the timbers, and struck out so as to cut across the course the vessel was taking.\n“I am saved!” murmured he.

He rose on the waves, making signs of distress; but no one on board saw him, and the vessel stood on another tack. Dantès would have shouted, but he knew that the wind would drown his voice.\nIt was then he rejoiced at his precaution in taking the timber, for without it he would have been unable, perhaps, to reach the vessel—certainly to return to shore, should he be unsuccessful in attracting attention.\nDantès, though almost sure as to what course the vessel would take, had yet watched it anxiously until it tacked and stood towards him. Then he advanced; but before they could meet, the vessel again changed her course. By a violent effort he rose half out of the water, waving his cap, and uttering a loud shout peculiar to sailors. This time he was both seen and heard, and the tartan instantly steered towards him. At the same time, he saw they were about to lower the boat.\nAn instant after, the boat, rowed by two men, advanced rapidly towards him. Dantès let go of the timber, which he now thought to be useless, and swam vigorously to meet them. But he had reckoned too much upon his strength, and then he realized how serviceable the timber had been to him. His arms became stiff, his legs lost their flexibility, and he was almost breathless.\nHe shouted again. The two sailors redoubled their efforts, and one of them cried in Italian, “Courage!”\nThe word reached his ear as a wave which he no longer had the strength to surmount passed over his head. He rose again to the surface, struggled with the last desperate effort of a drowning man, uttered a third cry, and felt himself sinking, as if the fatal cannon shot were again tied to his feet. The water passed over his head, and the sky turned gray. A convulsive movement again brought him to the surface. He felt himself seized by the hair, then he saw and heard nothing. He had fainted.",

Dantès remembered his unkempt appearance from his imprisonment, and quickly invented a vow. “I made a vow to Our Lady of the Grotto,” said he, “not to cut my hair or beard for ten years if I was saved from peril, and the ten years expire to-day.”",
                "refinement_prompt": "IMPROVEMENT GUIDANCE:\n1. MAJOR STRUCTURAL ISSUES:\n- The completion invents an internal monologue and confusion upon waking that is not present in the original, including Dantès questioning whether he is awake or dreaming and a detailed process of recollection.\n- The completion introduces a fabricated exchange about Dantès's name (\"Sindbad\") and a destination (\"To Genoa\"), which are not part of the original passage.\n- The completion omits the original's detailed dialogue between Dantès and the sailors, especially the sequence of questions and answers about his origins and the events leading to his rescue.\n\n2. MISSING ELEMENTS:\n- The completion lacks the original's specific description of the sailors' actions, such as the use of a woollen cloth and the identification of the sailor who called out encouragement.\n- The nuanced description of the captain's demeanor and the type of pity he feels is altered and simplified, missing the original's contrast between egotistical and empathetic pity.\n- The step-by-step recounting of Dantès's fabricated story about the shipwreck and his survival is condensed and omits key details, such as the fate of the rest of the crew and the specific method by which Dantès approached the vessel.\n- The original's exchange about the sailor who rescued Dantès and the reason for his appearance is abbreviated, missing the interplay and the reflection on Dantès's hair and beard.\n\n3. INACCURATE ELEMENTS:\n- The completion inaccurately attributes the question about Dantès's identity to a sailor in bad Italian, whereas the original specifies a different language and speaker.\n- The sequence of events is altered: in the completion, Dantès raises himself and sees the Château d’If before the sailors interact with him, whereas in the original, the sailors' actions precede his observations.\n- The completion introduces a new character name (\"Jacopo\") and a new destination, which are not present in the original passage.\n- The vow regarding Dantès's hair and beard is inaccurately described in terms of its duration and the circumstances of its expiration.\n- The completion omits the original's acknowledgment by the sailor who rescued Dantès and the specific dialogue about the rescue moment."

If you do not want me at Leghorn, you can leave me there, and I will pay you out of the first wages I get, for my food and the clothes you lend me.”\n“Ah,” said the captain, “we can agree very well, if you are reasonable.”\n“Give me what you give the others, and it will be all right,” returned Dantès.\n“That’s not fair,” said the seaman who had saved Dantès; “for you know more than we do.”\n“What is that to you, Jacopo?” returned the Captain. “Everyone is free to ask what he pleases.”\n“That’s true,” replied Jacopo; “I only make a remark.”\n“Well, you would do much better to find him a jacket and a pair of trousers, if you have them.”\n“No,” said Jacopo; “but I have a shirt and a pair of trousers.”\n“That is all I want,” interrupted Dantès. Jacopo dived into the hold and soon returned with what Edmond wanted.\n“Now, then, do you wish for anything else?” said the patron.\n“A piece of bread and another glass of the capital rum I tasted, for I have not eaten or drunk for a long time.” He had not tasted food for forty hours. A piece of bread was brought, and Jacopo offered him the gourd.\n“Larboard your helm,” cried the captain to the steersman. Dantès glanced that way as he lifted the gourd to his mouth; then paused with hand in mid-air.\n“Hollo! what’s the matter at the Château d’If?” said the captain.\nA small white cloud, which had attracted Dantès’ attention, crowned the summit of the bastion of the Château d’If. At the same moment the faint report of a gun was heard. The sailors looked at one another.\n“What is this?” asked the captain.\n“A prisoner has escaped from the Château d’If, and they are firing the alarm gun,” replied Dantès. The captain glanced at him, but he had lifted the rum to his lips and was drinking it with so much composure, that suspicions, if the captain had any, died away.\n“Pretty strong rum!” said Dantès, wiping his brow with his sleeve.\n“At any rate,” murmured he, “if it be, so much the better, for I have made a rare acquisition.”\nUnder pretence of being fatigued, Dantès asked to take the helm; the steersman, glad to be relieved, looked at the captain, and the latter by a sign indicated that he might abandon it to his new comrade. Dantès could thus keep his eyes on Marseilles.\n“What is the day of the month?” asked he of Jacopo, who sat down beside him.\n“The 28th of February.”\n“In what year?”\n“In what year—you ask me in what year?”\n“Yes,” replied the young man, “I ask you in what year!”\n“You have forgotten then?”\n“I got such a fright last night,” replied Dantès, smiling, “that I have almost lost my memory. I ask you what year is it?”\n“The year 1829,” returned Jacopo.\nIt was fourteen years, day for day, since Dantès’ arrest. He was nineteen when he entered the Château d’If; he was thirty-three when he escaped. A sorrowful smile passed over his face; he asked himself what had become of Mercédès, who must believe him dead. Then his eyes lighted up with hatred as he thought of the three men who had caused him so long and wretched a captivity. He renewed against Danglars, Fernand, and Villefort the oath of implacable vengeance he had made in his dungeon.\nThis oath was no longer a vain menace; for the fastest sailor in the Mediterranean would have been unable to overtake the little tartan, that with every stitch of canvas set was flying before the wind to Leghorn.",

He remained a long time, leaning his elbow on the bulwark, and his head on his hand.

Jacopo, who was a kind-hearted fellow, approached him. “What are you thinking of, messmate?” said he.\n\n“I am thinking,” replied Dantès, with a mournful smile, “that I have been a prisoner for fourteen years, and that I have just escaped.”\n\n“Fourteen years!” exclaimed Jacopo. “And where were you a prisoner?”\n\n“At the Château d’If.”\n\n“The Château d’If!” cried Jacopo. “That is a terrible prison. I have heard of it.”\n\n“Yes,” said Dantès; “it is a terrible prison.”\n\nHe was silent again, and looked at the sea. Suddenly, he started. “What is that?” said he.\n\n“What?” asked Jacopo.\n\n“That little white cloud yonder, above the Château d’If.”\n\n“That is the smoke of a cannon,” said the captain. “They are firing the alarm gun.”\n\n“An alarm gun?” said Dantès. “What does that mean?”\n\n“It means that a prisoner has escaped,” said the captain.\n\nDantès smiled. “They are looking for me,” said he. “They will not find me.”\n\nHe drank some rum, and his composure was so great that the captain had no suspicion. “Take the helm, Jacopo,” said he; “I am tired.”\n\nJacopo took the helm, and Dantès went and sat down near the captain. “What is the date to-day?” said he.\n\n“The 28th of February, 1829,” answered the captain.\n\n“The 28th of February, 1829!” repeated Dantès. “It is exactly fourteen years to-day since I was arrested. I was nineteen then; I am thirty-three now.”\n\nHe smiled sadly. “Poor Mercédès!” said he. “She must think me dead.”\n\nHis face darkened. “And Danglars, and Fernand, and Villefort!” he muttered. “They shall pay for this.”\n\nHe looked at the sea again. The tartan was sailing rapidly towards Leghorn. The Island of Tiboulen was already far behind. The Château d’If was no longer visible. Dantès felt a fierce joy. He was free. He was rich. He was powerful. He would be revenged.\n\nHe remained all day on deck, sometimes leaning against the mast, sometimes sitting on the bulwark, never taking his eyes off the sea. At night, he slept soundly, for the first time for fourteen years. When he awoke, the sun was high in the heavens. The tartan was still sailing towards Leghorn. Dantès felt a new man.

          "text_segment": "Dantès had not been a day on board before he had a very clear idea of the men with whom his lot had been cast. Without having been in the school of the Abbé Faria, the worthy master of La Jeune Amélie (the name of the Genoese tartan) knew a smattering of all the tongues spoken on the shores of that large lake called the Mediterranean, from the Arabic to the Provençal, and this, while it spared him interpreters, persons always troublesome and frequently indiscreet, gave him great facilities of communication, either with the vessels he met at sea, with the small boats sailing along the coast, or with the people without name, country, or occupation, who are always seen on the quays of seaports, and who live by hidden and mysterious means which we must suppose to be a direct gift of Providence, as they have no visible means of support. It is fair to assume that Dantès was on board a smuggler.\nAt first the captain had received Dantès on board with a certain degree of distrust. He was very well known to the customs officers of the coast; and as there was between these worthies and himself a perpetual battle of wits, he had at first thought that Dantès might be an emissary of these industrious guardians of rights and duties, who perhaps employed this ingenious means of learning some of the secrets of his trade. But the skilful manner in which Dantès had handled the lugger had entirely reassured him; and then, when he saw the light plume of smoke floating above the bastion of the Château d’If, and heard the distant report, he was instantly struck with the idea that he had on board his vessel one whose coming and going, like that of kings, was accompanied with salutes of artillery. This made him less uneasy, it must be owned, than if the new-comer had proved to be a customs officer; but this supposition also disappeared like the first, when he beheld the perfect tranquillity of his recruit.\nEdmond thus had the advantage of knowing what the owner was, without the owner knowing who he was; and however the old sailor and his crew tried to “pump” him, they extracted nothing more from him; he gave accurate descriptions of Naples and Malta, which he knew as well as Marseilles, and held stoutly to his first story. Thus the Genoese, subtle as he was, was duped by Edmond, in whose favor his mild demeanor, his nautical skill, and his admirable dissimulation, pleaded. Moreover, it is possible that the Genoese was one of those shrewd persons who know nothing but what they should know, and believe nothing but what they should believe.",

The ship's master, a Genoese, was a man of forty, proficient in all the Mediterranean languages, a skill that served him well in his dealings at sea and in port, hinting at the true nature of the vessel's activities.\n\nInitially, the captain regarded Dantès with suspicion, his sharp eyes suggesting he might be a customs spy sent to observe them. But Dantès's remarkable skill in handling the vessel, his innate understanding of the sea and the ship's movements, quickly dispelled this distrust.\n\nOne day, as they sailed near the coast, the sound of cannon fire echoed from the direction of the Château d’If. Coupled with Dantès's sudden appearance among them, the captain's imagination briefly took flight, leading him to wonder if Dantès was a figure of such importance that his movements were marked by artillery salutes. But this idea, like the spy theory before it, faded as the captain observed Dantès's unwavering calm, his composure undisturbed by the distant sounds of the fortress.\n\nDantès, for his part, maintained a significant advantage: he knew the captain was a smuggler, while his own identity remained a profound secret. The crew, curious about the newcomer, made attempts to glean information, but Dantès skillfully deflected their inquiries. He stuck to his fabricated backstory, relying on his genuine knowledge of Naples and Malta to lend credibility to his tales.\n\nHis gentle behavior, combined with his undeniable maritime expertise and an impressive ability to conceal his true self, effectively fooled the astute Genoese captain.

The crew of the Pharaon, while generally honest and hardworking, harbored the usual mix of personalities found on any long voyage. There was the old boatswain, a grizzled veteran who spoke little but whose eyes held the wisdom of countless seas. There were the younger sailors, eager and boisterous, looking up to Dantès with admiration for his skill and the captain's favor. But two figures stood out, not for their virtue, but for the shadows they cast upon his bright future: Danglars, the supercargo, and Caderousse, the tailor who had joined the ship for the return journey.Danglars, a man of cold, calculating ambition, viewed Dantès with undisguised envy. Dantès' rapid ascent, his youth, his popularity with the crew, and especially the captain's clear intention to name him as his successor, were galling to Danglars, who saw himself as the rightful heir to the captaincy. His smiles were thin, his words often laced with subtle malice, and his eyes followed Dantès with a predatory glint. Dantès, in his youthful innocence and optimism, perceived this animosity but attributed it to professional rivalry rather than deep-seated hatred. He could not fathom the depths of jealousy that festered in Danglars' heart.Caderousse, on the other hand, was a different sort of man. Weak-willed and often drunk, he was easily swayed by stronger personalities. He was envious too, but his envy was born of idleness and a perpetual state of dissatisfaction with his own lot. He was a hanger-on, a man who would follow the lead of whoever seemed most likely to benefit him, or at least, not harm him. Dantès saw him as merely unfortunate, perhaps a little troublesome, but certainly not a threat.As the Pharaon sailed, the captain, Leclère, grew increasingly ill. He confided in Dantès, entrusting him with the ship's command and, crucially, a package to be delivered upon their return. The captain's death at sea solidified Dantès' position as acting captain, a promotion that only intensified Danglars' simmering resentment. The voyage continued, marked by the captain's burial at sea and the growing tension between Dantès and Danglars. The stop at the Isle of Elba, a seemingly innocuous errand to fulfill the dying captain's last request, became the pivot point upon which Dantès' fate would turn. He delivered the letter, unaware of its contents or the perilous connection it forged. The return journey to Marseille was filled with Dantès' joyous anticipation of his wedding to Mercédès and his new life as captain, completely oblivious to the storm of betrayal brewing around him, orchestrated by the very men he had sailed with."

Here Edmond was to undergo another trial; he was to find out whether he could recognize himself, as he had not seen his own face for fourteen years. He had preserved a tolerably good remembrance of what the youth had been, and was now to find out what the man had become. His comrades believed that his vow was fulfilled. As he had twenty times touched at Leghorn, he remembered a barber in St. Ferdinand Street; he went there to have his beard and hair cut. The barber gazed in amazement at this man with the long, thick and black hair and beard, which gave his head the appearance of one of Titian’s portraits. At this period it was not the fashion to wear so large a beard and hair so long; now a barber would only be surprised if a man gifted with such advantages should consent voluntarily to deprive himself of them. The Leghorn barber said nothing and went to work.\nWhen the operation was concluded, and Edmond felt that his chin was completely smooth, and his hair reduced to its usual length, he asked for a looking-glass. He was now, as we have said, three-and-thirty years of age, and his fourteen years’ imprisonment had produced a great transformation in his appearance.\nDantès had entered the Château d’If with the round, open, smiling face of a young and happy man, with whom the early paths of life have been smooth, and who anticipates a future corresponding with his past. This was now all changed. The oval face was lengthened, his smiling mouth had assumed the firm and marked lines which betoken resolution; his eyebrows were arched beneath a brow furrowed with thought; his eyes were full of melancholy, and from their depths occasionally sparkled gloomy fires of misanthropy and hatred; his complexion, so long kept from the sun, had now that pale color which produces, when the features are encircled with black hair, the aristocratic beauty of the man of the north; the profound learning he had acquired had besides diffused over his features a refined intellectual expression; and he had also acquired, being naturally of a goodly stature, that vigor which a frame possesses which has so long concentrated all its force within itself.\nTo the elegance of a nervous and slight form had succeeded the solidity of a rounded and muscular figure. As to his voice, prayers, sobs, and imprecations had changed it so that at times it was of a singularly penetrating sweetness, and at others rough and almost hoarse.\nMoreover, from being so long in twilight or darkness, his eyes had acquired the faculty of distinguishing objects in the night, common to the hyena and the wolf. Edmond smiled when he beheld himself; it was impossible that his best friend—if, indeed, he had any friend left—could recognize him; he could not recognize himself.\n",

Here Dantès had a new task to perform, a difficult, a painful task: it was to enter a city, to approach a house, and to address a man, who, in the course of forty-eight hours, would make him look upon his past life as a dream. Dantès had not been to Leghorn for a long time, and he asked the captain to accompany him, as he feared he should not be able to find the house of the man he was going to visit. They inquired for the house of the Jew, Dantès’s broker; and, having found it, Dantès begged the captain to wait for him at a neighbouring café, as he did not wish to be seen by the Jew, who was a very old friend of his. Dantès entered the house, and, having been shown into a room, he saw a man sitting at a table, with a pen in his hand, and a ledger before him. This man was the Jew, Dantès’s broker. He was a man of about sixty years of age, with a long beard, and a face which was a perfect type of the Jewish race. He was very rich, and had a great reputation for honesty. Dantès had often had dealings with him, and had always found him a very honest man. Dantès approached him, and, having bowed, he said, “Sir, I am come to you on the part of the Count of Monte Cristo.” The Jew rose, and, having bowed in return, he said, “Sir, I am at your service.” Dantès then told him that the Count of Monte Cristo wished to have a sum of money placed in his hands, and that he had sent him to him for that purpose. The Jew said that he was ready to do whatever the Count of Monte Cristo wished, and that he had a large sum of money at his disposal. Dantès then told him that the Count of Monte Cristo wished to have a sum of two hundred thousand francs placed in his hands, and that he would give him a receipt for it. The Jew said that he was ready to give him the money, and that he would take his receipt for it. Dantès then gave him the receipt, and the Jew gave him the money. Dantès then took his leave, and, having rejoined the captain, he returned to the ship. On the following day, the ship set sail, and, after a prosperous voyage, they arrived at Marseilles. Dantès had now a large sum of money at his disposal, and he resolved to make use of it in order to carry out his plans. He first of all went to the house of his father, and, having found it, he entered it. He found his father sitting in a chair, with his head resting on his hands.

Dantès approached him, and, having knelt before him, he said, “Father, I am come to you.” The old man raised his head, and, having looked at him, he said, “Who are you?” Dantès said, “I am your son, Edmond.” The old man rose, and, having embraced him, he said, “My son, my son, I thought you were dead.” Dantès said, “No, father, I am alive.” The old man then asked him where he had been, and Dantès told him that he had been in prison. The old man then asked him why he had been in prison, and Dantès told him that he had been falsely accused of being a Bonapartist. The old man then asked him how he had got out of prison, and Dantès told him that he had escaped.

It will be remembered that he wore a shirt and trousers belonging to Jacopo, and a jacket of the captain’s; so, the moment he had purchased a ready-made suit, he hastened to the ship and called for Jacopo, who stared at him as if he had been a ghost, and was about to cross himself, when Edmond, smiling, took his hand. Jacopo pressed the hand of his friend in his own, and it was evident that he was powerfully affected. “See, my good fellow,” said Edmond, “I have not forgotten the service you rendered me, and I have hastened to return the clothes you so readily lent.

I shall be with you directly.” And, in fact, in the course of ten minutes Edmond entered the cabin, where the captain sat examining the books. “Ah, here you are!” said the latter, looking up. “I was expecting you.” “And I am at your service,” said Edmond. “Thank you; you are looking uncommonly well. And now, with regard to the offer I made you—” “Captain,” said Edmond, “your offer is a most liberal one, but your ship is only a coaster, and I require a vessel that can take me to the Orient.” “Ah, you wish to leave me, then?” “Not precisely; but I wish to see the East. I have a project which I can only accomplish by travelling.” “Well, well, you are an odd fellow, but I will not detain you against your will,” said the captain. “When do you wish to leave?” “In three months.” “In three months? That is a long time.” “Yes; but in that time I hope to have earned money enough to equip myself for my voyage.” “Well, so be it; I will give you three months’ trial, and if at the end of that time you are still resolved to leave me, I will furnish you with funds for your voyage.” “You are a worthy man, captain,” said Edmond, “and I accept your offer.” “That is agreed, then.

It will be remembered that he wore a shirt and trousers belonging to Jacopo, and a jacket of the captain’s; so, the moment he had purchased a ready-made suit, he hastened to the ship and called for Jacopo, who stared at him as if he had been a ghost, and was about to cross himself, when Edmond, smiling, took his hand.

This generous offer allowed him to anticipate his return to Marseille with even greater joy. His heart yearned for the sight of his aged father and, more importantly, for the embrace of his beloved Mercédès. The voyage had been successful, though tinged with sorrow by the sudden death of their captain, Leclère, who had succumbed to brain fever. Edmond, despite his youth, had skillfully taken command, guiding the ship safely back towards the French coast. He was now acting captain, a responsibility he bore with pride, yet his thoughts were consumed by the simple, profound happiness awaiting him ashore. He dreamt of the small house on the Allées de Meilhan, of his father's tearful welcome, and of the radiant smile of Mercédès. The future seemed bright, a clear horizon promising love, family, and a steady career at sea. Little did he know that a seemingly innocuous errand entrusted to him by Captain Leclère – the delivery of a letter from the Isle of Elba – held the seeds of a terrible destiny, poised to shatter his idyllic dreams and plunge him into an abyss of despair and injustice."

He had scarcely been a week at Leghorn before the hold of his vessel was filled with printed muslins, contraband cottons, English powder, and tobacco on which the excise had forgotten to put its mark. The master was to get all this out of Leghorn free of duties, and land it on the shores of Corsica, where certain speculators undertook to forward the cargo to France.\nThey sailed; Edmond was again cleaving the azure sea which had been the first horizon of his youth, and which he had so often dreamed of in prison. He left Gorgone on his right and La Pianosa on his left, and went towards the country of Paoli and Napoleon.\nThe next morning going on deck, as he always did at an early hour, the patron found Dantès leaning against the bulwarks gazing with intense earnestness at a pile of granite rocks, which the rising sun tinged with rosy light. It was the Island of Monte Cristo.\nLa Jeune Amélie left it three-quarters of a league to the larboard and kept on for Corsica. Dantès thought, as they passed so closely to the island whose name was so interesting to him, that he had only to leap into the sea and in half an hour be at the promised land. But then what could he do without instruments to discover his treasure, without arms to defend himself? Besides, what would the sailors say? What would the patron think? He must wait.\nFortunately, Dantès had learned how to wait; he had waited fourteen years for his liberty, and now he was free he could wait at least six months or a year for wealth. Would he not have accepted liberty without riches if it had been offered to him? Besides, were not those riches chimerical?—offspring of the brain of the poor Abbé Faria, had they not died with him?

This new cargo was destined for the coast of the Duchy of Lucca, and consisted almost entirely of Havana cigars, sherry, and Malaga wines.\nThere they had a bit of a skirmish in getting rid of the duties; the excise was, in truth, the everlasting enemy of the patron of La Jeune Amélie. A customs officer was laid low, and two sailors wounded; Dantès was one of the latter, a ball having touched him in the left shoulder. Dantès was almost glad of this affray, and almost pleased at being wounded, for they were rude lessons which taught him with what eye he could view danger, and with what endurance he could bear suffering. He had contemplated danger with a smile, and when wounded had exclaimed with the great philosopher, “Pain, thou art not an evil.”\nHe had, moreover, looked upon the customs officer wounded to death, and, whether from heat of blood produced by the encounter, or the chill of human sentiment, this sight had made but slight impression upon him. Dantès was on the way he desired to follow, and was moving towards the end he wished to achieve; his heart was in a fair way of petrifying in his bosom.

He pointed out to him the bearings of the coast, explained to him the variations of the compass, and taught him to read in that vast book opened over our heads which they call heaven, and where God writes in azure with letters of diamonds.\nAnd when Jacopo inquired of him, “What is the use of teaching all these things to a poor sailor like me?” Edmond replied, “Who knows?

He had, more than twenty times since he had been thus engaged, passed the Island of Monte Cristo, but, to his great regret, he had not been able to land upon it. He then formed a resolution that, as soon as his engagement with the captain of the Jeune Amélie ended, he would, for the sum of a hundred piastres, charter a small vessel, and, under some pretext, either of pleasure or business, make a trip to the Island of Monte Cristo. There he would land, and, being alone, he would be free to make what researches he thought proper. But this was only a project, and, like all projects, it presented innumerable obstacles. The first was, that in the four or five months during which he was bound to the captain of the Jeune Amélie, he could not dispose of his time, and then he was without the hundred piastres he had reckoned upon. But at the end of these four or five months the money would be due to him, and he did not doubt he should obtain it. The greatest obstacle was the almost impossibility of a solitary descent upon the Island of Monte Cristo; for he knew that if he wished to keep the secret of his treasure, he must keep it from all the world, and Edmond was not so sanguine as to suppose he could keep it from the curious eyes of the crew of the vessel he should charter. Then, if he proposed to the crew to land with him, what was he to do? If he left them on board, he ran the risk of their again setting sail and leaving him; and, on the other hand, he would be obliged to have assistance to dig up the earth, and he did not desire his companions in labour, who would naturally expect their share of the profit, to be witnesses of his proceedings. All these reflections made Edmond reflect that, in order to attain his end, he must act with the greatest caution, and that, above all, he must be alone. In the meantime, he became more and more inured to the hardships of his life, and to the dangers of the sea.",

Dantès had already been at this tavern two or three times, and had seen the singular importance which the captain of La Jeune Amélie, a vessel reputed one of the fastest sailers of the Mediterranean, held among these men, who were not, like the smugglers of Corsica, Sardinia, or the Isle of Elba, rude ignorant peasants, but men of intellect, possessing a kind of empirical knowledge of navigation, and acquainted with all the seas, coasts, currents, and rocks of the Mediterranean; and who, more especially, knew how to profit by the winds. At this moment they were discussing an important undertaking, which was no less than the landing near Almeria, on the coast of Spain, of a cargo of Turkey carpets, Greek silks, and Smyrna opium, which were to be exchanged for ingots of silver, taken from the mines of Andalusia, and belonging to the smugglers of the Sierra Morena. The Jeune Amélie was to have her share in the profits, and this share would amount to a sum of about forty thousand francs. The only difficulty was in landing these goods, and the place agreed on had been Monte Cristo, a small island situated twenty-five miles south of Pianosa, between Corsica and the Isle of Elba, and which had been purchased by a society of wealthy speculators, who were to have made it a watering-place, but who had abandoned the enterprise, and consequently it was uninhabited and unvisited, except by a few fishermen and custom-house officers. It seemed, however, that the fishermen and custom-house officers had disappeared, and for some time past the island had been deserted. The proposition of the captain of La Jeune Amélie was, that the smugglers should deposit their goods in the caves of Monte Cristo, and that he should take them on board when the revenue officers were not watching. An agreement was entered into, by which the Jeune Amélie was to be at Monte Cristo in a week, and to remain there two days. Dantès heard all this, and a strange feeling took possession of him. Monte Cristo was the island where the treasure was hidden! He could not doubt it. He rose and went out, as if to take the air, but in reality to conceal his emotion. He returned in a few minutes, and found that the discussion was ended, and the agreement concluded. The captain of La Jeune Amélie was to sail the next night. When Dantès returned, the captain asked him what he thought of the plan. “I think,” said Dantès, “that it is a good one, and that it will succeed.” “And you will go with us?” asked the captain. “I will,” replied Dantès. “But,” added he, “you must be very careful.” “We will,” said the captain. “And now,” said he, turning to the smugglers, “you have heard what has been agreed upon. The Jeune Amélie will be at Monte Cristo in a week, and will remain there two days. You will bring your goods to the island, and we will take them on board.” The smugglers promised to be there, and the meeting broke up.

He had often, in his reveries, considered what a power a man might acquire for himself who should unite all these scattered and independent wills into one single body, and should direct this body as he would an individual will. He had often thought that if he had fifty thousand livres, and such a man had been presented to him, he would have joined him, and, aided by his own genius, and the money of the other, have become the leader of this hardy and adventurous race, who live between heaven and earth, and have no other acknowledged representatives upon earth than the mythological Mercury, and the modern smuggler. It was a curious study for a thinking man to see these men, with their sunburnt faces and their hands hardened with toil, with their eyes and lips, which seemed to speak of nothing but the sea, and with their gestures, which seemed to represent the waves, sitting round a table, and discussing in all the languages of the Mediterranean, from the Arabic to the Provençal, the affairs of their trade, which were, in fact, the affairs of the world. On this occasion, they were discussing an important undertaking, which was no less than the landing near Almeria, on the coast of Spain, of a cargo of Turkey carpets, Greek silks, and Smyrna opium, which were to be exchanged for ingots of silver, taken from the mines of Andalusia, and belonging to the smugglers of the Sierra Morena.

MAJOR STRUCTURAL ISSUES:\n- The completion introduces invented details about the backgrounds and characteristics of the smugglers, as well as the reputation and history of the ship and its captain, which are not present in the original passage.\n- There is an invented subplot involving a plan to exchange goods for silver ingots from Spanish mines, and a detailed description of the island's supposed purchase by speculators, which does not appear in the original.\n- The completion adds a scene where Dantès explicitly connects the island to a hidden treasure and has an internal revelation, which is not part of the original passage.\n- The ending includes invented dialogue and a meeting conclusion that are not present in the source text.\n\n2. MISSING ELEMENTS:\n- The completion omits the original's reflection on the potential power of a person who could unite the diverse interests of the smugglers.\n- It does not include the specific discussion about the need to find neutral ground for exchanging goods and the mention of the types of goods and the potential profit for the crew.\n- The completion leaves out the mythological reference to Mercury and the comparison between ancient and modern views of merchants and robbers.\n- The original's description of the tavern's atmosphere, including the mix of languages, is missing.\n- The process by which the decision to use Monte Cristo is made, including Dantès' opinion on the plan and the emphasis on acting quickly, is not fully represented.\n\n3. INACCURATE ELEMENTS:\n- The completion inaccurately changes the location of the smuggling operation from the coast of France to Spain, and alters the nature of the goods and the financial arrangements.\n- The sequence of events is altered: in the original, the plan is discussed and decided upon before Dantès is consulted, whereas the completion has Dantès being asked after the agreement is made.\n- The timing for the voyage and the duration of the stay at Monte Cristo are changed from the original's immediate departure to a week-long delay and a two-day stay.\n- The completion attributes actions and dialogue to characters that do not occur in the original, such as the extended conversation between Dantès and the captain and the smugglers' promises at the end."

          "text_segment": "Thus, at length, by one of the unexpected strokes of fortune which sometimes befall those who have for a long time been the victims of an evil destiny, Dantès was about to secure the opportunity he wished for, by simple and natural means, and land on the island without incurring any suspicion. One night more and he would be on his way.\nThe night was one of feverish distraction, and in its progress visions, good and evil, passed through Dantès’ mind. If he closed his eyes, he saw Cardinal Spada’s letter written on the wall in characters of flame—if he slept for a moment the wildest dreams haunted his brain. He ascended into grottos paved with emeralds, with panels of rubies, and the roof glowing with diamond stalactites. Pearls fell drop by drop, as subterranean waters filter in their caves. Edmond, amazed, wonderstruck, filled his pockets with the radiant gems and then returned to daylight, when he discovered that his prizes had all changed into common pebbles. He then endeavored to re-enter the marvellous grottos, but they had suddenly receded, and now the path became a labyrinth, and then the entrance vanished, and in vain did he tax his memory for the magic and mysterious word which opened the splendid caverns of Ali Baba to the Arabian fisherman. All was useless, the treasure disappeared, and had again reverted to the genii from whom for a moment he had hoped to carry it off.\nThe day came at length, and was almost as feverish as the night had been, but it brought reason to the aid of imagination, and Dantès was then enabled to arrange a plan which had hitherto been vague and unsettled in his brain. Night came, and with it the preparation for departure, and these preparations served to conceal Dantès’ agitation. He had by degrees assumed such authority over his companions that he was almost like a commander on board; and as his orders were always clear, distinct, and easy of execution, his comrades obeyed him with celerity and pleasure.\nThe old patron did not interfere, for he too had recognized the superiority of Dantès over the crew and himself. He saw in the young man his natural successor, and regretted that he had not a daughter, that he might have bound Edmond to him by a more secure alliance. At seven o’clock in the evening all was ready, and at ten minutes past seven they doubled the lighthouse just as the beacon was kindled. The sea was calm, and, with a fresh breeze from the south-east, they sailed beneath a bright blue sky, in which God also lighted up in turn his beacon lights, each of which is a world. Dantès told them that all hands might turn in, and he would take the helm. When the Maltese (for so they called Dantès) had said this, it was sufficient, and all went to their bunks contentedly.\nThis frequently happened. Dantès, cast from solitude into the world, frequently experienced an imperious desire for solitude; and what solitude is more complete, or more poetical, than that of a ship floating in isolation on the sea during the obscurity of the night, in the silence of immensity, and under the eye of Heaven?",

The night before he was to land was one of intense agitation, and he did not close his eyes. The letter of Cardinal Spada was ever present to his thoughts, and in the flames he seemed to discover the words written in fiery letters; and if he for a moment slumbered, the wildest dreams haunted his brain. He wandered in caverns of emeralds, rubies, and diamonds, of which the smallest was as large as a nut; he walked amidst a shower of pearls, which fell around him like rain; and when he woke, he was so struck by the power of the illusion, that he would have doubted whether the treasures were not real, had he not recollected that his grottos were in the Bastille, and his shower of pearls was the black rain of the Château d’If. Daylight, however, brought a clearer view of things, and with the sun, which rose resplendent from the sea, Dantès’s horizon seemed to expand; and he was again himself, that is to say, the man of firm resolve and decided purpose. The preparations for departure were made for the evening. Dantès, who was very skilful, aided the smugglers in their task, and while so doing, concealed his agitation. The evening arrived, and with it the moment of departure. Dantès had during the two days he had been on board, by his extraordinary energy and activity, acquired considerable influence over the crew, and in case of a hazardous enterprise, the smugglers would have confidently trusted to him. The old patron, who was as good a sailor as he was a smuggler, and who had been told of the Spanish captain’s opinion of Dantès, welcomed him with a joyful air, and was proud of having such a man for his second. He would have been glad to have had him for his captain. Had he possessed a daughter, he would have given her to him in marriage. By seven o’clock all was ready, and they were waiting for the moment of departure. Shortly after, they doubled the lighthouse just as the beacon was lighted. The sea was calm, and the heavens were covered with stars, and the vessel, leaving the coast on the right, steered towards the south-east, under the influence of a favorable breeze. Dantès offered to take the helm, and as he was an excellent helmsman, the patron readily consented, and called his men, that they might take their rest. When Dantès was left alone, he felt a sensation he had not experienced for a long time, and which is known only to those who, after a long captivity, are restored to liberty. He found himself once more with the feeling of being master of his own destiny. Having been so long pent up in a prison, and forced to converse with the walls, he was now at liberty to speak, to move, to act, to think. The ship was his world, the sea was his solitude, and the night was his time for reflection. He had been so long shut up from the world, that he had forgotten it, and he had been so long shut up with himself, that he had forgotten himself. He was now at liberty to think, and he found that he had a great deal to think about. He had to think about the past, the present, and the future. He had to think about his past sufferings, his present position, and his future prospects. He had to think about his enemies, his friends, and his family. He had to think about his revenge, his fortune, and his happiness. He had to think about all these things, and he had to think about them alone. He had been so long in the midst of society, that he had forgotten the pleasure of solitude, and he had been so long in solitude, that he had forgotten the pleasure of society. He was now in a position to enjoy both. He was alone, and yet he was not alone. He was alone with his thoughts, and yet he was not alone with his thoughts.

The *Jeune Amélie*, the vessel on which he served, was bound for Leghorn, and a sudden squall, feigned or real, had driven them near the Isle of Monte Cristo.  The captain, a man of little curiosity and much superstition, readily agreed to Dantès' suggestion that they anchor in a small cove to wait out the weather, and that he, Dantès, should go ashore with a few men to hunt wild goats, a plausible excuse for landing on the uninhabited rock.  The crew, eager for fresh meat and indifferent to the desolate appearance of the island, readily assented.  Dantès, with a beating heart he struggled to keep calm, prepared his hunting gear, ensuring he also carried the tools he would need for a different kind of quarry.  As the boat neared the shore, his eyes devoured the rugged coastline, searching for the landmarks Abbé Faria had so meticulously described from memory.  He recognized the distinctive shape of the rocks, the cluster of stunted trees, the entrance to the hidden cove.  It was all there, exactly as the old man had foretold.  They landed, and while the others dispersed in search of game, Dantès, feigning interest in a different direction, moved towards the area where the Abbé had indicated the treasure lay.  He watched his companions disappear among the rocks, a sense of profound solitude washing over him, mingled with an almost unbearable anticipation.  He was alone on the island, the sole possessor of a secret that could change his life, and indeed, the lives of many others.  He found the grotto, a dark, cool opening in the rock face, partially concealed by thick bushes.  He entered, the air inside damp and still.  Following the Abbé's instructions, he located the specific spot, marked by a peculiar rock formation.  He began to dig, the pickaxe striking the earth with a dull thud.  Hours passed.  The sun climbed high, then began its descent.  His muscles ached, his hands were raw, but he worked with a feverish intensity, driven by the hope that had sustained him through fourteen years of hell.  He thought of Faria, of his wisdom, his courage, his unwavering faith in this hidden wealth.  He thought of Mercédès, of his father, of the men who had wronged him.  Each stroke of the pickaxe was a blow against his past, a step towards his future.  Suddenly, the pickaxe struck something hard and metallic.  His heart leaped into his throat.  He dropped to his knees, clearing away the earth with frantic hands.  It was a chest, bound with iron, heavy and ancient.  With trembling fingers, he forced open the lid.  Inside, glittering in the dim light, lay a king's ransom in gold coins, jewels, and precious artifacts.  It was real.  The treasure of the Spada family.  He stared, breathless, tears streaming down his face.  Fourteen years of suffering, of despair, of planning, had led to this moment.  He was no longer Edmond Dantès, the wronged sailor; he was the master of an immense fortune, the architect of his own destiny.  The weight of the chest was nothing compared to the weight of the power it represented.  He closed the lid, his mind already racing with possibilities, with plans for vengeance and for a new life.

Edmond resigned the lugger to the master’s care, and went and lay down in his hammock; but, in spite of a sleepless night, he could not close his eyes for a moment.\nTwo hours afterwards he came on deck, as the boat was about to double the Island of Elba. They were just abreast of Mareciana, and beyond the flat but verdant Island of La Pianosa. The peak of Monte Cristo reddened by the burning sun, was seen against the azure sky. Dantès ordered the helmsman to put down his helm, in order to leave La Pianosa to starboard, as he knew that he should shorten his course by two or three knots. About five o’clock in the evening the island was distinct, and everything on it was plainly perceptible, owing to that clearness of the atmosphere peculiar to the light which the rays of the sun cast at its setting.\nEdmond gazed very earnestly at the mass of rocks which gave out all the variety of twilight colors, from the brightest pink to the deepest blue; and from time to time his cheeks flushed, his brow darkened, and a mist passed over his eyes.

INACCURATE ELEMENTS:\n- The timing and sequence of events are altered: the completion suggests Edmond is on deck at sunrise and then two hours later near Elba, whereas the original has a more precise sequence involving his rest and return to the deck.\n- The completion inaccurately attributes the vessel's position relative to Monte Cristo and Elba, and changes the order in which islands are mentioned or passed.\n- The emotional description at the end is generally preserved, but the comparison to a gambler is reworded and slightly reframed, which changes the intensity and focus of Edmond's feelings as originally depicted."

In spite of his usual command over himself, Dantès could not restrain his impetuosity. He was the first to jump on shore; and had he dared, he would, like Lucius Brutus, have “kissed his mother earth.” It was dark, but at eleven o’clock the moon rose in the midst of the ocean, whose every wave she silvered, and then, “ascending high,” played in floods of pale light on the rocky hills of this second Pelion.\nThe island was familiar to the crew of La Jeune Amélie,—it was one of her regular haunts. As to Dantès, he had passed it on his voyage to and from the Levant, but never touched at it. He questioned Jacopo.\n“Where shall we pass the night?” he inquired.\n“Why, on board the tartan,” replied the sailor.\n“Should we not do better in the grottos?”\n“What grottos?”\n“Why, the grottos—caves of the island.”\n“I do not know of any grottos,” replied Jacopo.\nThe cold sweat sprang forth on Dantès’ brow.\n“What, are there no grottos at Monte Cristo?” he asked.\n“None.”\nFor a moment Dantès was speechless; then he remembered that these caves might have been filled up by some accident, or even stopped up, for the sake of greater security, by Cardinal Spada. The point was, then, to discover the hidden entrance. It was useless to search at night, and Dantès therefore delayed all investigation until the morning. Besides, a signal made half a league out at sea, and to which La Jeune Amélie replied by a similar signal, indicated that the moment for business had come.\nThe boat that now arrived, assured by the answering signal that all was well, soon came in sight, white and silent as a phantom, and cast anchor within a cable’s length of shore.",

The sailors, with the activity and skill peculiar to their calling, commenced unloading the cargo, which consisted of bales of silks and carpets from Persia, and cases of pipes and chibouks from Turkey, which were destined for the Pasha of Yanina. While working alongside the others, Dantès contemplated the immense joy he could unleash among them with a single word, by revealing the secret of the treasure that constantly occupied his thoughts. He decided against disclosing his precious secret, fearing he might have already revealed too much through his restlessness, persistent questions, detailed observations, and obvious preoccupation. Fortunately, his sorrowful past had etched an enduring sadness onto his face, making any fleeting signs of gaiety seem like temporary aberrations, thus preventing suspicion. No one suspected his true motives; when he announced his intention to hunt wild goats the next day with a fowling-piece, powder, and shot, his companions interpreted it as a fondness for sport or a desire for solitude. Jacopo, however, insisted on accompanying him. Dantès did not object, worried that refusing might provoke distrust. After walking only a short distance and having killed a kid, Dantès asked Jacopo to carry it back to their comrades, instructing them to cook it and signal him by firing a gun when it was ready. Their planned meal consisted of this kid, some dried fruits, and a flask of Monte Pulciano wine. Dantès continued his trek, frequently glancing around him. From a high rock, he observed his companions below, now rejoined by Jacopo, all engaged in preparing the meal that his marksmanship had enhanced. Edmond regarded them for a moment with a sad, gentle smile, indicative of a man who felt superior to his peers. He mused that in two hours, his companions would depart, each richer by fifty piastres, ready to risk their lives again for a similar sum, eventually amassing a small fortune only to squander it ostentatiously in some city. At that moment, his own hope made their modest wealth seem contemptible to him. He briefly considered the possibility that future disappointment might compel him to view such small sums as the pinnacle of happiness but quickly dismissed the thought.

The cause was not in Dantès, but in Providence, who, while limiting the power of man, has filled him with boundless desires.\nMeanwhile, by a cleft between two walls of rock, following a path worn by a torrent, and which, in all human probability, human foot had never before trod, Dantès approached the spot where he supposed the grottos must have existed. Keeping along the shore, and examining the smallest object with serious attention, he thought he could trace, on certain rocks, marks made by the hand of man.\nTime, which encrusts all physical substances with its mossy mantle, as it invests all things of the mind with forgetfulness, seemed to have respected these signs, which apparently had been made with some degree of regularity, and probably with a definite purpose. Occasionally the marks were hidden under tufts of myrtle, which spread into large bushes laden with blossoms, or beneath parasitical lichen. So Edmond had to separate the branches or brush away the moss to know where the guide-marks were. The sight of marks renewed Edmond fondest hopes. Might it not have been the cardinal himself who had first traced them, in order that they might serve as a guide for his nephew in the event of a catastrophe, which he could not foresee would have been so complete. This solitary place was precisely suited to the requirements of a man desirous of burying treasure. Only, might not these betraying marks have attracted other eyes than those for whom they were made? and had the dark and wondrous island indeed faithfully guarded its precious secret?\nIt seemed, however, to Edmond, who was hidden from his comrades by the inequalities of the ground, that at sixty paces from the harbor the marks ceased; nor did they terminate at any grotto. A large round rock, placed solidly on its base, was the only spot to which they seemed to lead. Edmond concluded that perhaps instead of having reached the end of the route he had only explored its beginning, and he therefore turned round and retraced his steps.\nMeanwhile his comrades had prepared the repast, had got some water from a spring, spread out the fruit and bread, and cooked the kid. Just at the moment when they were taking the dainty animal from the spit, they saw Edmond springing with the boldness of a chamois from rock to rock, and they fired the signal agreed upon. The sportsman instantly changed his direction, and ran quickly towards them. But even while they watched his daring progress, Edmond’s foot slipped, and they saw him stagger on the edge of a rock and disappear. They all rushed towards him, for all loved Edmond in spite of his superiority; yet Jacopo reached him first.\nHe found Edmond lying prone, bleeding, and almost senseless. He had rolled down a declivity of twelve or fifteen feet.",

Edmond opened his eyes, complained of great pain in his knee, a feeling of heaviness in his head, and severe pains in his loins. They wished to carry him to the shore; but when they touched him, although under Jacopo’s directions, he declared, with heavy groans, that he could not bear to be moved.\nIt may be supposed that Dantès did not now think of his dinner, but he insisted that his comrades, who had not his reasons for fasting, should have their meal. As for himself, he declared that he had only need of a little rest, and that when they returned he should be easier. The sailors did not require much urging. They were hungry, and the smell of the roasted kid was very savory, and your tars are not very ceremonious. An hour afterwards they returned. All that Edmond had been able to do was to drag himself about a dozen paces forward to lean against a moss-grown rock.\nBut, instead of growing easier, Dantès’ pains appeared to increase in violence. The old patron, who was obliged to sail in the morning in order to land his cargo on the frontiers of Piedmont and France, between Nice and Fréjus, urged Dantès to try and rise. Edmond made great exertions in order to comply; but at each effort he fell back, moaning and turning pale.\n“He has broken his ribs,” said the commander, in a low voice. “No matter; he is an excellent fellow, and we must not leave him. We will try and carry him on board the tartan.”\nDantès declared, however, that he would rather die where he was than undergo the agony which the slightest movement cost him.\n“Well,” said the patron, “let what may happen, it shall never be said that we deserted a good comrade like you. We will not go till evening.”\nThis very much astonished the sailors, although, not one opposed it. The patron was so strict that this was the first time they had ever seen him give up an enterprise, or even delay in its execution. Dantès would not allow that any such infraction of regular and proper rules should be made in his favor.\n“No, no,” he said to the patron, “I was awkward, and it is just that I pay the penalty of my clumsiness. Leave me a small supply of biscuit, a gun, powder, and balls, to kill the kids or defend myself at need, and a pickaxe, that I may build a shelter if you delay in coming back for me.”\n“But you’ll die of hunger,” said the patron.\n“I would rather do so,” was Edmond’s reply, “than suffer the inexpressible agonies which the slightest movement causes me.”\nThe patron turned towards his vessel, which was rolling on the swell in the little harbor, and, with sails partly set, would be ready for sea when her toilet should be completed.\n“What are we to do, Maltese?” asked the captain. “We cannot leave you here so, and yet we cannot stay.”\n“Go, go!” exclaimed Dantès.\n“We shall be absent at least a week,” said the patron, “and then we must run out of our course to come here and take you up again.”\n“Why,” said Dantès, “if in two or three days you hail any fishing-boat, desire them to come here to me. I will pay twenty-five piastres for my passage back to Leghorn. If you do not come across one, return for me.” The patron shook his head.\n“Listen, Captain Baldi; there’s one way of settling this,” said Jacopo. “Do you go, and I will stay and take care of the wounded man.”\n“And give up your share of the venture,” said Edmond, “to remain with me?”\n“Yes,” said Jacopo, “and without any hesitation.”\n“You are a good fellow and a kind-hearted messmate,” replied Edmond, “and heaven will recompense you for your generous intentions; but I do not wish anyone to stay with me. A day or two of rest will set me up, and I hope I shall find among the rocks certain herbs most excellent for bruises.”\nA peculiar smile passed over Dantès’ lips; he squeezed Jacopo’s hand warmly, but nothing could shake his determination to remain—and remain alone.",

I only need rest, and I shall be better when you return. Go, eat your meal, my good fellows, you have no reason to fast because I have been clumsy.” The sailors, who had had no food since the morning, did not require much urging, and the savoury smell of the roasted kid, which Jacopo, as a provident cook, had prepared, was very tempting. They ate, then, and an hour afterwards, when they returned to Dantès, they found him in the same place, but he had dragged himself about a dozen paces, and was leaning against a moss-covered rock. His pains seemed to have increased. The old patron, who was obliged to sail in the morning to deliver his cargo, urged Dantès to try and get up. Edmond made great efforts, but each time he fell back, moaning and turning pale. “He has broken his ribs,” said the patron, speaking softly to the others; “but he is an excellent fellow, and we must not abandon him. We will try and carry him aboard our vessel.” “No,” said Dantès, “I would rather die where I am than suffer the agony of being moved.” “Well,” said the patron, with a sigh, “we will not leave till the evening.” This decision astonished the sailors, for it was the first time they had ever seen him delay an operation. “No, no,” said Dantès, “do not on my account deviate from your usual strict rules. It is my own fault, and I must bear the penalty. Leave me here; I shall do very well.” “But you will die of hunger,” said the patron. “I would rather die of hunger than endure the pain of movement,” replied Edmond. “What are we to do, then?” said the patron, looking towards his vessel, which was ready for sea. “We cannot leave you, and we cannot stay.” “Leave me,” said Dantès. “No.” “But you must sail.” “Yes.” “Then leave me.” “No.” “But you must,” said Dantès; “I am only a burden to you.” “No,” said the patron; “you are not a burden to us.” “But I am in pain,” said Dantès. “Yes, we see that you are in pain,” said the patron. “Then leave me,” said Dantès. “No,” said the patron; “we will not leave you.” “But you must,” said Dantès; “I am only a burden to you.” “No,” said the patron; “you are not a burden to us.” “But I am in pain,” said Dantès. “Yes, we see that you are in pain,” said the patron. “Then leave me,” said Dantès. “No,” said the patron; “we will not leave you.” “But you must,” said Dantès; “I am only a burden to you.” “No,” said the patron; “you are not a burden to us.” “But I am in pain,” said Dantès. “Yes, we see that you are in pain,” said the patron. “Then leave me,” said Dantès. “No,” said the patron; “we will not leave you.” “But you must,” said Dantès; “I am only a burden to you.” “No,” said the patron; “you are not a burden to us.” “But I am in pain,” said Dantès. “Yes, we see that you are in pain,” said the patron. “Then leave me,” said Dantès. “No,” said the patron; “we will not leave you.” “But you must,” said Dantès; “I am only a burden to you.” “No,” said the patron; “you are not a burden to us.” “But I am in pain,” said Dantès. “Yes, we see that you are in pain,” said the patron. “Then leave me,” said Dantès. “No,” said the patron; “we will not leave you.” “But you must,” said Dantès; “I am only a burden to you.” “No,” said the patron; “you are not a burden to us.” “But I am in pain,” said Dantès. “Yes, we see that you are in pain,” said the patron. “Then leave me,” said Dantès. “No,” said the patron; “we will not leave you.” “But you must,” said Dantès; “I am only a burden to you.” “No,” said the patron; “you are not a burden to us.” “But I am in pain,” said Dantès. “Yes, we see that you are in pain,” said the patron. “Then leave me,” said",
                "refinement_prompt": "IMPROVEMENT GUIDANCE:\n1. MAJOR STRUCTURAL ISSUES:\n- The completion invents a lengthy, repetitive dialogue between Dantès and the patron that is not present in the original passage. This invented exchange dominates the middle and end of the completion, replacing actual narrative events and decisions.\n- Several key narrative developments from the original, such as the sailors leaving for their meal, Dantès insisting they eat, and the subsequent return of the sailors, are omitted entirely.\n- The original's depiction of Jacopo offering to stay behind and Dantès refusing this offer is missing, as is the discussion about leaving supplies and Dantès' plan for self-sufficiency.\n\n2. MISSING ELEMENTS:\n- Early on, the completion omits the original's details about Dantès' specific complaints regarding his physical condition and the sailors' initial attempts to move him under Jacopo's direction.\n- The sequence where Dantès encourages the others to eat while he rests, and the description of the sailors' meal and their return, is absent.\n- The original's account of the patron's need to depart for a specific destination and the time constraints involved is not included.\n- The negotiation about leaving Dantès with supplies, his request for specific items, and his reasoning for remaining alone are not present.\n- The offer from Jacopo to stay and Dantès' refusal, along with his mention of using herbs for healing, are missing.\n\n3. INACCURATE ELEMENTS:\n- The completion introduces incorrect medical speculation and dialogue about the nature of Dantès' injury, which is not part of the original.\n- The sequence of events is altered: the completion focuses on a circular argument about leaving Dantès, rather than the original's progression from injury, to meal, to decision-making about Dantès' fate.\n- The completion attributes lines and emotional responses to characters that do not match the original, such as Jacopo's exaggerated willingness to suffer injury himself.\n- The completion omits the original's resolution, where Dantès firmly insists on being left alone and the patron reluctantly agrees, as well as the practical arrangements for Dantès' survival.\n\nTo improve, focus on accurately representing the sequence of events, including the meal, the sailors' return, the discussion of supplies, and the offers of help. Avoid inventing repetitive or circular dialogue and ensure all key decisions and character actions from the original are included in the correct order."

Despite the teeming life of the island under that fierce midday sun, Edmond Dantès felt profoundly alone, yet not abandoned, believing himself guided by a divine hand towards his destiny. But even in this desolate, uninhabited landscape, an unsettling feeling gripped him, a sensation akin to being watched. This inexplicable unease compelled him to momentarily halt his intended excavation. He laid down his pickaxe, took up his gun, and ascended the island's highest peak to scan his surroundings. His gaze, however, was not drawn to the distant mainlands of Corsica, Sardinia, Elba, or the Italian coast, but rather to the sea, where two vessels were departing: the brigantine that had left earlier in the morning and a tartan that had recently set sail. He watched the brigantine vanish towards the Straits of Bonifacio and the tartan head around the northern point of Corsica. As the last sails disappeared below the horizon, a sense of relief and security washed over him.\n```",

Despite the teeming life of the island under that fierce midday sun, Edmond Dantès felt profoundly alone, yet not abandoned, believing himself guided by a divine hand towards his destiny. But even in this desolate, uninhabited landscape, an unsettling feeling gripped him, a sensation akin to being watched. This inexplicable unease compelled him to momentarily halt his intended excavation. He laid down his pickaxe, took up his gun, and ascended the island's highest peak to scan his surroundings. His gaze, however, was not drawn to the distant mainlands of Corsica, Sardinia, Elba, or the Italian coast, but rather to the sea, where two vessels were departing: the brigantine that had left earlier in the morning and a tartan that had recently set sail. He watched the brigantine vanish towards the Straits of Bonifacio and the tartan head around the northern point of Corsica. As the last sails disappeared below the horizon, a sense of relief and security washed over him.\n```",

Then he descended with cautious and slow step, for he dreaded lest an accident similar to that he had so adroitly feigned should happen in reality.\nDantès, as we have said, had traced the marks along the rocks, and he had noticed that they led to a small creek, which was hidden like the bath of some ancient nymph. This creek was sufficiently wide at its mouth, and deep in the centre, to admit of the entrance of a small vessel of the lugger class, which would be perfectly concealed from observation.\nThen following the clew that, in the hands of the Abbé Faria, had been so skilfully used to guide him through the Dædalian labyrinth of probabilities, he thought that the Cardinal Spada, anxious not to be watched, had entered the creek, concealed his little barque, followed the line marked by the notches in the rock, and at the end of it had buried his treasure. It was this idea that had brought Dantès back to the circular rock. One thing only perplexed Edmond, and destroyed his theory.",

A large stone had served as a wedge; flints and pebbles had been inserted around it, so as to conceal the orifice; this species of masonry had been covered with earth, and grass and weeds had grown there, moss had clung to the stones, myrtle-bushes had taken root, and the old rock seemed fixed to the earth.\nDantès dug away the earth carefully, and detected, or fancied he detected, the ingenious artifice. He attacked this wall, cemented by the hand of time, with his pickaxe. After ten minutes’ labor the wall gave way, and a hole large enough to insert the arm was opened.\nDantès went and cut the strongest olive-tree he could find, stripped off its branches, inserted it in the hole, and used it as a lever. But the rock was too heavy, and too firmly wedged, to be moved by anyone man, were he Hercules himself. Dantès saw that he must attack the wedge. But how?\nHe cast his eyes around, and saw the horn full of powder which his friend Jacopo had left him. He smiled; the infernal invention would serve him for this purpose.\nWith the aid of his pickaxe, Dantès, after the manner of a labor-saving pioneer, dug a mine between the upper rock and the one that supported it, filled it with powder, then made a match by rolling his handkerchief in saltpetre.

What, then, would be the use of all I have suffered? The heart breaks when, after having been elated by flattering hopes, it sees all its illusions destroyed. Faria has dreamed this; the Cardinal Spada buried no treasure here; perhaps he never came here, or if he did, Cæsar Borgia, the intrepid adventurer, the stealthy and indefatigable plunderer, has followed him, discovered his traces, pursued them as I have done, raised the stone, and descending before me, has left me nothing.”\nHe remained motionless and pensive, his eyes fixed on the gloomy aperture that was open at his feet.\n“Now that I expect nothing, now that I no longer entertain the slightest hopes, the end of this adventure becomes simply a matter of curiosity.” And he remained again motionless and thoughtful.\n“Yes, yes; this is an adventure worthy a place in the varied career of that royal bandit. This fabulous event formed but a link in a long chain of marvels. Yes, Borgia has been here, a torch in one hand, a sword in the other, and within twenty paces, at the foot of this rock, perhaps two guards kept watch on land and sea, while their master descended, as I am about to descend, dispelling the darkness before his awe-inspiring progress.”\n“But what was the fate of the guards who thus possessed his secret?” asked Dantès of himself.\n“The fate,” replied he, smiling, “of those who buried Alaric, and were interred with the corpse.”\n“Yet, had he come,” thought Dantès, “he would have found the treasure, and Borgia, he who compared Italy to an artichoke, which he could devour leaf by leaf, knew too well the value of time to waste it in replacing this rock.",

He had only found the first grotto; he had now to seek the second. Dantès continued his search. He reflected that this second grotto must penetrate deeper into the island; he examined the stones, and sounded one part of the wall where he fancied the opening existed, masked for precaution’s sake.\nThe pickaxe struck for a moment with a dull sound that drew out of Dantès’ forehead large drops of perspiration. At last it seemed to him that one part of the wall gave forth a more hollow and deeper echo; he eagerly advanced, and with the quickness of perception that no one but a prisoner possesses, saw that there, in all probability, the opening must be.\nHowever, he, like Cæsar Borgia, knew the value of time; and, in order to avoid fruitless toil, he sounded all the other walls with his pickaxe, struck the earth with the butt of his gun, and finding nothing that appeared suspicious, returned to that part of the wall whence issued the consoling sound he had before heard.\nHe again struck it, and with greater force. Then a singular thing occurred. As he struck the wall, pieces of stucco similar to that used in the ground work of arabesques broke off, and fell to the ground in flakes, exposing a large white stone. The aperture of the rock had been closed with stones, then this stucco had been applied, and painted to imitate granite. Dantès struck with the sharp end of his pickaxe, which entered someway between the interstices.",

              "simple_agent_extraction": "I will go down.”\n\nAnd he descended, with a cynical smile, muttering the word “Perhaps!”\n\nContrary to the expectation of Dantès, who expected to find the darkness and foul air of a grotto, he felt a dim, bluish light, and a pure and balmy air. The blue light, evidently, came from the crevices of the rock which, not withstanding the thickness of the walls, allowed the heavens to be seen, and the pure air from the great depth of the grotto, which communicated with the sea. After having stood a few seconds in the darkness, the eyes of Dantès began to distinguish the objects around him. He saw that the cavern was nearly forty feet long and about twenty-five wide; while, to his great surprise, the walls were of granite, and sparkled like diamonds from the many crystals embedded in them. He had imagined he should find some rude and barbarous excavation, and he saw a splendid grotto, glittering with all the wonders of mineralogy. “Oh,” said he, smiling, “this is, doubtless, the Cardinal’s treasure which Faria dreamt of. He told me of grottos, of sparkling grottos, but I did not understand him.”\n\nAnd he again nearly despaired. “Ah,” said he, “my dear Abbé, your dream was that of a miser, and, like yours, mine will remain unaccomplished, unless indeed, the sparkling crystals which cover these walls may be called the treasures you announced to me.”\n\nBut his eye had all this time been scanning the cavern, and he remarked that the granite walls did not extend all round, and that the part returning towards the island was formed of stones cemented together, and by the inequality of the surface showed the hand of man. He remembered the Abbé’s words, “In the angle opposite to the entrance,” and returning to the spot from which he had set out, he calculated the angle and there, in reality, saw the wall built by the hand of man. If there had been no other indication, this would have been sufficient to give him an idea of the Abbé’s meaning, and the importance of his discovery. Dantès struck the wall, and sounded every part of it in the hopes of finding a hollow place, but the wall, although evidently built, was everywhere solid. He did not, however, lose courage, but on the contrary, redoubled his efforts. The pickaxe struck against the stones, and some pieces of stucco fell off, but the wall remained as firm as before. He then observed in the roof of the cavern, a kind of hermetically sealed opening, and he concluded that the Abbé had passed through there, and had closed it after him by placing a stone over the opening. But on reaching the roof, Dantès discovered that the opening was not large enough for a man to pass through, and he was forced to abandon the idea of entering by that way. He returned to the wall, and again began to sound it. This time, he struck with greater force, and the pickaxe penetrated the wall to the depth of a few inches. Dantès felt a thrill of joy, and he continued to strike with all his might. At last, after a few minutes of intense labour, a large stone became loose, and fell to the ground, leaving a dark opening in the wall. Dantès had found the secret entrance.\n\nHe had, however, to be sure that he was not mistaken, and that this was really the second opening mentioned in the will. He examined the opening, and saw that it led into a narrow passage, which seemed to extend into the interior of the island. He took a torch from his belt, and lit it, and then entered the passage. After having proceeded a few steps, he found himself in a small grotto, which was evidently the one mentioned in the will. It was about the size of the first one, but the walls were not of granite, but of rough stone. In the middle of the grotto, there was a large stone chest, which was evidently the one mentioned in the will. Dantès approached the chest, and saw that it was closed with a heavy lid. He tried to open it, but it was too heavy for him. He then remembered that the will mentioned a lever, and he looked around for it. He soon found a large iron bar, which was evidently the lever mentioned in the will. He took the lever, and inserted it under the lid of the chest, and then exerted all his strength to raise the lid. After a few seconds of intense effort, the lid began to move, and at last, it was raised high enough for Dantès to see what was inside the chest. He saw that the chest was full of gold coins, and precious stones. Dantès had found the treasure.\n\nHe stood for a moment, speechless with astonishment and joy. He could not believe his eyes. He had found the treasure which had been the object of his search for so many years. He had found the treasure which was to make him the richest man in the world. He had found the treasure which was to enable him to take his revenge on those who had wronged him.\n\nAfter",

After escaping the Château d’If and finding refuge with smugglers, he had finally reached the coordinates Faria had painstakingly described. The island was rugged, overgrown, and seemingly uninhabited, a perfect hiding place for the immense fortune of the Spada family. Following Faria’s map, which he had memorized, Dantès located the designated spot: a small cove, marked by a specific rock formation. With a pickaxe and shovel borrowed from the smugglers, he began to excavate. The work was arduous, the ground hard and resistant. Days blurred into a relentless cycle of digging under the scorching sun, fueled only by the promise of wealth and the burning desire for vengeance. He dug deeper and deeper, sweat pouring from his brow, muscles aching, until finally, his shovel struck something solid. It was a chest, heavy and bound with iron. His heart pounded with anticipation."

After several blows he perceived that the stones were not cemented, but had been merely placed one upon the other, and covered with stucco; he inserted the point of his pickaxe, and using the handle as a lever, with joy soon saw the stone turn as if on hinges, and fall at his feet.\nHe had nothing more to do now, but with the iron tooth of the pickaxe to draw the stones towards him one by one. The aperture was already sufficiently large for him to enter, but by waiting, he could still cling to hope, and retard the certainty of deception. At last, after renewed hesitation, Dantès entered the second grotto.\nThe second grotto was lower and more gloomy than the first; the air that could only enter by the newly formed opening had the mephitic smell Dantès was surprised not to find in the outer cavern. He waited in order to allow pure air to displace the foul atmosphere, and then went on.\nAt the left of the opening was a dark and deep angle. But to Dantès’ eye there was no darkness. He glanced around this second grotto; it was, like the first, empty.\nThe treasure, if it existed, was buried in this corner. The time had at length arrived; two feet of earth removed, and Dantès’ fate would be decided.\nHe advanced towards the angle, and summoning all his resolution, attacked the ground with the pickaxe. At the fifth or sixth blow the pickaxe struck against an iron substance. Never did funeral knell, never did alarm-bell, produce a greater effect on the hearer. Had Dantès found nothing he could not have become more ghastly pale.\nHe again struck his pickaxe into the earth, and encountered the same resistance, but not the same sound.\n“It is a casket of wood bound with iron,” thought he.\nAt this moment a shadow passed rapidly before the opening; Dantès seized his gun, sprang through the opening, and mounted the stair. A wild goat had passed before the mouth of the cave, and was feeding at a little distance. This would have been a favorable occasion to secure his dinner; but Dantès feared lest the report of his gun should attract attention.\nHe thought a moment, cut a branch of a resinous tree, lighted it at the fire at which the smugglers had prepared their breakfast, and descended with this torch.\n",

In the first, gold coins of all ages and all nations were piled; and from the quantity, which was evidently but a part of the whole, Edmond judged that this first compartment alone contained at least a million of francs, and yet it was not a third part of the chest. The second compartment was filled with ingots of unpolished gold, which assuredly weighed two or three hundredweight each; and the third was filled with diamonds, pearls, and rubies, which, when stirred by the hand, flowed, sparkled, and rustled like hail against glass. After having touched, felt, examined these treasures, Edmond, breathless, dizzy, and bewildered, rushed out of the grotto, and clambered over the rocks, till he reached a spot from whence he could behold the sea. He was alone—alone with this immense, unheard-of, unexpected treasure. Was he awake, or was it but a dream? He would fain have gazed upon his gold, but he had not the strength; he would fain have shouted, but his voice failed him. He remained an hour thus, panting, groaning, his hair moist with perspiration. At length he recovered himself, and said, “Oh, yes, it is indeed reality! Thanks be to God, who has vouchsafed me this treasure!” He then thought of the dangers that might menace him, and hastened to make himself secure. He returned to the cavern, and found the chest as he had left it, but it seemed to him that the second compartment was not so full as when he had before visited it.

Again he climbed the rocky height he had ascended the previous evening, and strained his view to catch every peculiarity of the landscape; but it wore the same wild, barren aspect when seen by the rays of the morning sun which it had done when surveyed by the fading glimmer of eve.\nDescending into the grotto, he lifted the stone, filled his pockets with gems, put the box together as well and securely as he could, sprinkled fresh sand over the spot from which it had been taken, and then carefully trod down the earth to give it everywhere a uniform appearance; then, quitting the grotto, he replaced the stone, heaping on it broken masses of rocks and rough fragments of crumbling granite, filling the interstices with earth, into which he deftly inserted rapidly growing plants, such as the wild myrtle and flowering thorn, then carefully watering these new plantations, he scrupulously effaced every trace of footsteps, leaving the approach to the cavern as savage-looking and untrodden as he had found it. This done, he impatiently awaited the return of his companions.

Monte Cristo was as desolate at this early hour as it was at midnight; and the sea, breaking on the rocks with the same monotonous sound, was as calm as during the stillness of night. “Now, then,” said Dantès, when he had completed his circuit of the island, “to work!” And this time it was to a work of precaution that he hastened. All the morning was occupied in transporting the chests from the grotto to the place which he had chosen for their permanent concealment. This was a kind of hermetically sealed chamber, with its entrance concealed by a rock, which required more than the strength of three men to move. The real treasure was buried in this royal sepulchre; and the false was restored to its place in the grotto. The transport of the chests occupied three hours, and Dantès found it necessary to be very careful in selecting his time, that he might not be perceived by the smugglers, who were not in the habit of rising before nine or ten o’clock. He then returned to the grotto, and, with the aid of a pickaxe and a spade, which he found there, he effaced every trace of the excavation, and restored the ground to the state in which he had found it. The mouth of the grotto was then closed with the large stone, and camouflaged with earth, rocks, and newly planted vegetation, so that it was impossible to discover that it had ever been opened. All then being completed, Dantès returned to the summit of the mountain, and waited, with his heart full of impatience, the return of the smugglers. It was not that he was afraid of being discovered, for he was well armed, and the smugglers were not likely to attack him; but he was eager to return to the world, and to begin the work which he had so long meditated.

The Jew, a shrewd man named Giacopo, examined the stones with a practiced eye, his initial skepticism melting into awe as he recognized their exceptional quality, despite the Count's description of them as \"smallest.\" He paid the twenty thousand francs without demur, sensing the immense wealth behind this mysterious customer. With this initial capital, the Count began his transformation. He did not squander the money but used it strategically. He purchased a small, swift polacca, a type of Mediterranean sailing vessel, and hired a loyal, discreet crew, mostly Corsicans known for their silence and fidelity. He also acquired various goods for trade, establishing a legitimate cover for his movements around the Mediterranean. This transaction in Leghorn was merely the first step in a grand, meticulously planned operation. It provided him with the necessary liquidity and the means to travel freely, laying the groundwork for the elaborate schemes of vengeance and justice he intended to execute. The twenty thousand francs, a mere fraction of the Abbe Faria's treasure, was the seed from which his future power and influence would grow, enabling him to move from a fugitive to a formidable force."

A bargain was therefore struck. Dantès led the owner of the yacht to the dwelling of a Jew; retired with the latter for a few minutes to a small back parlor, and upon their return the Jew counted out to the shipbuilder the sum of sixty thousand francs in bright gold pieces.\nThe delighted builder then offered his services in providing a suitable crew for the little vessel, but this Dantès declined with many thanks, saying he was accustomed to cruise about quite alone, and his principal pleasure consisted in managing his yacht himself; the only thing the builder could oblige him in would be to contrive a sort of secret closet in the cabin at his bed’s head, the closet to contain three divisions, so constructed as to be concealed from all but himself.

He had named her the *Sea Serpent*, a fitting name for a craft that seemed to glide effortlessly over the water, leaving a frothy wake in her path.

She is indeed magnificent.\" As the *Sea Serpent* completed her circuit and headed back towards the harbour, a solitary figure stood on the quay, observing the scene with keen interest. This figure, cloaked and seemingly detached from the bustling activity around him, was none other than the Count of Monte Cristo. He had come to Genoa not merely to admire a yacht, but for purposes far more profound, purposes that required swift passage across the seas and vessels capable of outrunning any pursuer.

MISSING ELEMENTS:\n- Early in the passage, the completion does not include the transition from the crowd's initial curiosity to their admiration, specifically the details about the boat's responsiveness and the brief trial Dantès gives it, which leads to his acknowledgment of the Genoese shipbuilders' reputation.\n- In the middle, the completion lacks the sequence where the spectators follow the vessel with their eyes until it disappears and then begin to speculate about its destination, listing several possible locations and noting that Monte Cristo is not considered.\n- At the end, the completion does not mention Dantès' careful observation of the shore and his decision to anchor in a different spot than usual, nor does it specify that the island showed no signs of recent visitors.\n\n3. INACCURATE ELEMENTS:\n- The completion inaccurately states that Dantès immediately directs the yacht toward Monte Cristo after leaving port, omitting the narrative misdirection about the possible destinations.\n- The sequence of events is compressed: the completion suggests Dantès lands and transfers the treasure in a single action, rather than noting the passage of time (arrival at the end of the second day, starting the transfer early the next morning, and finishing by nightfall).\n- The completion introduces a metaphor about the yacht moving \"with the alacrity of a bird,\" which is not present in the original, and adds a general statement about the Genoese builders' claims, which is not directly supported by the original passage.\n- The completion does not accurately reflect the timing and process of the treasure transfer, missing the detail that the work began early in the morning and was completed by nightfall."

The vessel itself, a masterpiece of design and speed, was the envy of every shipowner in the harbor, its lines sharp, its sails perfectly set, a stark contrast to the humble *Pharaon* of his youth. Aboard, a crew of silent, efficient men, hand-picked from the corners of the world, moved with practiced ease, their loyalty bought not just with gold, but with the promise of adventure and the mystique surrounding their enigmatic master. Dantès, standing on the deck, felt the familiar sway of the ship beneath his feet, a sensation that had once meant freedom and a future, now a vehicle for a different kind of journey. His eyes, though calm, held the depth of suffering and the cold fire of purpose. He was no longer merely Edmond Dantès, the sailor, but the Count of Monte Cristo, a man reborn from the depths of despair, armed with a fortune beyond imagining and a plan meticulously crafted over years of solitary reflection. The wealth he commanded was not an end in itself, but a tool, a means to an end that consumed his every thought. As Genoa faded into the distance, he turned his gaze westward, towards France, towards the unsuspecting individuals who had built their lives upon the ruins of his own. The sea breeze carried the scent of salt and freedom, but for the Count, it was the scent of impending reckoning."

Dantès had discovered that a communication existed between the two grottos, and by removing a few stones, could pass from one to the other.

In the larger grotto, Dantès resolved to take up his abode, and had accordingly brought there his provisions, arms, and some tools, and large quantities of powder and balls from the stores of the yacht. By degrees, he made himself a sort of dwelling, rude and rough, it is true, but in which he was amply provided with all that was necessary for life. As the yacht was furnished with a small oven, Dantès was enabled to make bread, and had often fresh fish, which he caught and cooked. The island was covered with myrtles, with an abundance of sweet herbs, and with plants to which Dantès, who was no botanist, gave the general name of weeds, and which, at his first arrival, he had looked upon as useless, but which, on closer examination, he found might be converted to some use. There were among them some with sweet-smelling roots, not unlike gentian. For a week, Dantès lived thus, one day following another and, with the exception of the time he occupied in arranging his dwelling, or in fishing, or hunting, he walked, climbed, and explored the island. At the end of the week, he had become as active as a chamois, and as expert a marksman as a Carbinier. He had named his yacht the *Island of Monte Cristo*, and he was himself the king of this island, and the owner of the treasures it contained. The eighth day he was on the summit of the highest mountain, on the side facing the sea, surveying the ocean with a spy-glass, which was one of the articles Dantès had thought of bringing from the yacht, when he perceived a small vessel sailing along, the very size and shape of the one he had given to Jacopo. He doubted not it was he. He lowered the tricolor flag, and hoisted it instantly. Jacopo did the same, and steered directly for the island.

Two of the men from Jacopo’s boat came on board the yacht to assist in navigating it, and he gave orders that she should be steered direct to Marseilles. For his father’s death he was in some manner prepared; but he knew not how to account for the mysterious disappearance of Mercédès.\nWithout divulging his secret, Dantès could not give sufficiently clear instructions to an agent. There were, besides, other particulars he was desirous of ascertaining, and those were of a nature he alone could investigate in a manner satisfactory to himself. His looking-glass had assured him, during his stay at Leghorn, that he ran no risk of recognition; moreover, he had now the means of adopting any disguise he thought proper. One fine morning, then, his yacht, followed by the little fishing-boat, boldly entered the port of Marseilles, and anchored exactly opposite the spot from whence, on the never-to-be-forgotten night of his departure for the Château d’If, he had been put on board the boat destined to convey him thither.\nStill Dantès could not view without a shudder the approach of a gendarme who accompanied the officers deputed to demand his bill of health ere the yacht was permitted to hold communication with the shore; but with that perfect self-possession he had acquired during his acquaintance with Faria, Dantès coolly presented an English passport he had obtained from Leghorn, and as this gave him a standing which a French passport would not have afforded, he was informed that there existed no obstacle to his immediate debarkation.\nThe first person to attract the attention of Dantès, as he landed on the Canebière, was one of the crew belonging to the Pharaon. Edmond welcomed the meeting with this fellow—who had been one of his own sailors—as a sure means of testing the extent of the change which time had worked in his own appearance. Going straight towards him, he propounded a variety of questions on different subjects, carefully watching the man’s countenance as he did so; but not a word or look implied that he had the slightest idea of ever having seen before the person with whom he was then conversing.",

Although the news of his father’s death had greatly affected him, and while he was prepared for this, that of Mercédès’s disappearance still struck him with the force of a new and unexpected blow. Like the traveller lost in a desert, he had counted on the mirage of an oasis, and suddenly found that the trees which he had perceived with such delight were merely leafless skeletons. An instinctive feeling told him that Mercédès was not dead; and this feeling was so strong that it became a conviction. But, as she was not dead, she had forgotten him. If she had forgotten him, she was guilty, and did not merit the happiness which he would have given her. Thus, with the indefatigable perseverance of vengeance, he decided that Mercédès, although she had not committed the crime, should suffer the punishment. He hastened, therefore, the preparations for his departure, and ordered the yacht to be steered direct for Marseilles. It was about noon when the yacht entered the port.

            "prefix-probing": "Dantès listened to these melancholy tidings with outward calmness; but, leaping lightly ashore, he signified his desire to be quite alone. The news of his father’s death, following so closely upon the shock of Mercédès’s marriage, struck him like a physical blow, though his features remained impassive. He needed solitude to wrestle with the tempest that raged within his soul. He walked with rapid strides towards the quarter where his humble home had stood, his heart heavy with a dread he dared not name. The familiar streets seemed alien, the air thick with the ghosts of his past happiness. When he reached the spot, he found the house shuttered, silent, and bearing the unmistakable signs of long abandonment. A neighbor, an old woman who remembered him, emerged and confirmed his worst fears. His father, she recounted, had died of grief and want, refusing all aid, his spirit broken by the loss of his son. He had pined away, day by day, until death released him from his suffering. Dantès’s eyes burned, but no tears fell. His grief was too profound, too sharp, to find such easy release. He then inquired about Mercédès. The old woman hesitated, then spoke of the beautiful Catalan’s despair, her long vigil, and finally, her marriage to Fernand Mondego, who had, she added with a sigh, seemed to care for her deeply in her sorrow. Dantès listened, his face a mask of stone. He learned that Danglars had left Marseille long ago, having risen rapidly in the world of finance. Fernand, now Count de Morcerf, was a wealthy and influential peer. Caderousse, the tailor, still lived nearby, though fallen on hard times. Leaving the old woman, Dantès sought out Caderousse. He found him in a state of drunken squalor. Through a mixture of veiled questions and feigned ignorance, Dantès drew out the full, sordid tale of the conspiracy – the letter, the denunciation, the roles played by Danglars, Fernand, and even Caderousse himself through his silence. The truth, in all its ugliness, solidified his pain into a cold, hard resolve. The calmness was gone, replaced by a terrible, focused intensity. He had come seeking solace and found only confirmation of betrayal and ruin. His path was now clear, illuminated by the dark light of vengeance."

I see that I have made a trifling mistake, as you say; but by way of rewarding your honesty I give you another double Napoleon, that you may drink to my health, and be able to ask your messmates to join you.”\nSo extreme was the surprise of the sailor, that he was unable even to thank Edmond, whose receding figure he continued to gaze after in speechless astonishment. “Some nabob from India,” was his comment.\nDantès, meanwhile, went on his way. Each step he trod oppressed his heart with fresh emotion; his first and most indelible recollections were there; not a tree, not a street, that he passed but seemed filled with dear and cherished memories. And thus he proceeded onwards till he arrived at the end of the Rue de Noailles, from whence a full view of the Allées de Meilhan was obtained. At this spot, so pregnant with fond and filial remembrances, his heart beat almost to bursting, his knees tottered under him, a mist floated over his sight, and had he not clung for support to one of the trees, he would inevitably have fallen to the ground and been crushed beneath the many vehicles continually passing there. Recovering himself, however, he wiped the perspiration from his brows, and stopped not again till he found himself at the door of the house in which his father had lived.\nThe nasturtiums and other plants, which his father had delighted to train before his window, had all disappeared from the upper part of the house.\nLeaning against the tree, he gazed thoughtfully for a time at the upper stories of the shabby little house. Then he advanced to the door, and asked whether there were any rooms to be let. Though answered in the negative, he begged so earnestly to be permitted to visit those on the fifth floor, that, in despite of the oft-repeated assurance of the concierge that they were occupied, Dantès succeeded in inducing the man to go up to the tenants, and ask permission for a gentleman to be allowed to look at them.\nThe tenants of the humble lodging were a young couple who had been scarcely married a week; and seeing them, Dantès sighed heavily. Nothing in the two small chambers forming the apartments remained as it had been in the time of the elder Dantès; the very paper was different, while the articles of antiquated furniture with which the rooms had been filled in Edmond’s time had all disappeared; the four walls alone remained as he had left them.\nThe bed belonging to the present occupants was placed as the former owner of the chamber had been accustomed to have his; and, in spite of his efforts to prevent it, the eyes of Edmond were suffused in tears as he reflected that on that spot the old man had breathed his last, vainly calling for his son.\nThe young couple gazed with astonishment at the sight of their visitor’s emotion, and wondered to see the large tears silently chasing each other down his otherwise stern and immovable features; but they felt the sacredness of his grief, and kindly refrained from questioning him as to its cause, while, with instinctive delicacy, they left him to indulge his sorrow alone.\nWhen he withdrew from the scene of his painful recollections, they both accompanied him downstairs, reiterating their hope that he would come again whenever he pleased, and assuring him that their poor dwelling would ever be open to him.\nAs Edmond passed the door on the fourth floor, he paused to inquire whether Caderousse the tailor still dwelt there; but he received for reply, that the person in question had got into difficulties, and at the present time kept a small inn on the route from Bellegarde to Beaucaire.",

Every street, every house, every tree, recalled some circumstance of his past life; and, notwithstanding the lapse of time, the sad remembrance of the past seemed to efface the joyous hope of the future. He had intended to enter the city by the Rue Saint-Ferréol, where he had been accustomed to pass, but he directed his steps towards the Allées de Meilhan. There was a tree, behind which he had often, in his boyish days, awaited Mercédès, and the recollection of those days brought back so forcibly the sad event which had blotted them out, that he stopped, and leaned against the trunk of the tree to recover himself.  Presently he saw the house where his father had lived. At this sight, a cold shudder ran through his veins. How had that poor old man lived since he had left him? He was not dead, at least, since he was not in the tomb which had been so lately opened. He had not left Marseilles, or the grave would have been dug in the cemetery of the city, and not in the country.  He approached the house, a small, mean-looking habitation, such as artisans and poor people occupy. He saw the window of the room where his father had slept; and on the sill were two or three plants, which the good old man had loved to cultivate, and which, even before he went to sea, Dantès had recommended to his care. The window was open, and he saw that the room was occupied by strangers.  The sight of these plants, so fresh and green, and which seemed to have been so carefully tended, made a strange impression on him; he could not understand how it was that they had not withered and died, like the hopes of the poor man who had so loved them.  He went to the door, and knocked. It was opened by a woman, who asked him what he wanted.  “I wish to see the person who lives on the fifth floor,” said Dantès.  “The fifth floor?” said the woman; “there is no one on the fifth floor.”  “What!” said Dantès; “has not M. Dantès lived here?”  “M. Dantès? I do not know him. No one of that name has lived here since I have been in the house.”  “Since you have been in the house? How long is that?”  “About a year.”  “And before that?”  “Before that, I do not know; I am not the concierge.”  “And is there no one who can give me any information?”  “The concierge is in the lodge; you can ask her.”  Dantès went to the lodge, and found the concierge, a woman of about sixty, with a sour and forbidding countenance.  “Madame,” said Dantès, “can you tell me who lived on the fifth floor about ten years ago?”  “About ten years ago? I do not remember. I have been here only seven years.”  “And before that?”  “Before that, I do not know. I bought the house from the person who kept it before me.”  “And do you know what has become of the former tenants?”  “No, I do not. I have heard that the old man who lived on the fifth floor died here.”  “Died here?” said Dantès, with a shudder. “And when was that?”  “About ten years ago, I think.”  “And did he die in this house?”  “Yes.”  “And was he buried from here?”  “Yes.”  “And do you know where he was buried?”  “No, I do not. I was not here at the time.”  Dantès turned away, and went out. He could not bear to stay any longer in that house, which was now a tomb. He walked on, not knowing whither he went, and at length found himself on the quay. He saw the Pharaon, the ship in which he had sailed, lying at anchor. He went on board, and found the captain, who was a stranger to him. He asked him if he knew anything of the former crew. The captain told him that they were all dispersed, and that he did not know what had become of them.  Dantès left the ship, and went on shore. He walked about the city, and at length found himself in the street where Caderousse had lived. He went to the house, and knocked at the door. It was opened by a woman, who asked him what he wanted.  “I wish to see M. Caderousse,” said Dantès.  “M. Caderousse?” said the woman; “he does not live here.”  “He does not live here?” said Dantès; “where does he live, then?”  “He lives in the country, about ten leagues from here.”  “In the country? And what does he do there?”  “He keeps a small inn.”  “An inn? And is he married?”  “Yes, he is married.”  “And has he any children?”  “No, he has no children.”  Dantès thanked the woman, and went away. He had now learned all that he wished to know. His father was dead, Mercédès was married, and Caderousse was a publican. He had no longer any tie to Marseilles. He resolved to leave the city immediately.  He went to the port, and found a ship that was about to sail for Italy. He took a passage on board",

He turned. The sailor was running after him, gesticulating wildly. Dantès paused, a little surprised. “What is it, my friend?” he asked. The sailor, out of breath, pointed back towards the port. “The Pharaon! She’s signalled! Just coming into view!”\n\nDantès’ heart gave a great leap. The Pharaon! His ship! Home! He had only left her a few hours ago, but the thought of her return, of seeing his father and Mercédès, filled him with an overwhelming joy that made him forget his fatigue. He didn’t wait for the sailor to say more, but turned and ran back towards the harbour with a speed that astonished the man who had called him. The news spread like wildfire through the narrow streets leading to the port. People emerged from their houses and shops, pointing towards the sea, murmuring the name of the ship. The Pharaon was a well-known vessel in Marseille, and her return was always an event.\n\nBy the time Dantès reached the quays, a considerable crowd had already gathered. Sailors, merchants, idlers, and women whose husbands or sons were aboard, all strained their eyes towards the horizon where the ship’s masts were now clearly visible against the blue sky. Dantès pushed his way through the throng, his eyes fixed on the familiar silhouette. He saw Monsieur Morrel, the shipowner, standing near the edge of the quay, his face alight with satisfaction. Beside him stood Danglars, the supercargo, his features, usually sharp and calculating, softened slightly by the general excitement, though a keen observer might detect a flicker of something less pleasant in his eyes. Not far off, leaning against a post, was Caderousse, the tailor, a man known for his idleness and envy, watching the scene with a sullen expression. And lurking in the background, his dark eyes fixed on Dantès, was Fernand Mondego, the Catalan fisherman, consumed by a jealousy he barely bothered to conceal.\n\nDantès reached Monsieur Morrel, who turned at the sound of his hurried footsteps. “Ah, Edmond! Here you are! I was just asking for you. Welcome back, my boy! Welcome back!” Morrel’s voice was warm and hearty. “The signal came in just now. You made excellent time.”\n\nDantès, breathless but beaming, saluted his employer. “Monsieur Morrel, it is good to be back. The voyage was… eventful.”\n\n“So I gather,” said Morrel, his smile fading slightly. “We received word of poor Captain Leclère’s illness. A great loss. He was a good man.”\n\n“Indeed, sir,” replied Dantès, his face clouding over. “He died two days before we reached Elba. It was sudden.”\n\n“And you, I presume, took command?” Morrel asked, his eyes searching Dantès’ face.\n\n“Yes, sir. It was the captain’s dying wish. He gave me his papers and his instructions.”\n\n“And you carried them out?”\n\n“To the letter, sir. We put into Elba, as he directed. I delivered a package to the Grand Marshal, as Captain Leclère instructed.”\n\nMorrel nodded slowly, a thoughtful expression on his face. “Elba… the Grand Marshal… Interesting. Well, you did well, Edmond. You handled a difficult situation admirably. Captain Leclère always spoke highly of you, you know. He saw your potential.” He clapped Dantès on the shoulder. “And he was right. You have proven yourself. The Pharaon needs a captain, and I believe I have found him.” He looked Dantès directly in the eye. “Upon my word, Edmond, if you are willing, the position is yours. You shall be captain of the Pharaon.”\n\nDantès"

The tenants were so astonished at this unexpected and liberality, that they almost doubted the evidence of their senses; but the notary assured them that it was perfectly true, and added that M. de Wilmore not only offered them the said chambers rent-free, but would also defray the expenses of their removal to any part of the city they chose.

He entered the modest house, a wave of profound emotion washing over him. This was the place where his father had lived, suffered, and died. Every corner, every shadow, seemed to whisper tales of a past life, a life brutally interrupted. He walked through the rooms, his steps echoing in the silence, his eyes scanning for the familiar, the remembered. He knew precisely where to look. Guided by memory and a burning purpose, he went directly to the fireplace in the small chamber his father had occupied. With trembling hands, he began to search the stones of the hearth, the very spot where his father had often sat. Behind a loose stone, just as he remembered, he found a small, worn stocking. Inside were gold and silver coins, totaling fourteen hundred francs – his father’s life savings, carefully put aside for his son’s marriage to Mercédès. Holding the small fortune, so insignificant compared to his current wealth yet infinitely precious, Dantès felt a surge of grief and righteous fury. This money, meant for happiness, had remained hidden while his father starved, believing his son lost forever. The discovery solidified his resolve; the suffering endured within these walls demanded retribution. This house, purchased at such an inflated price, was not merely property; it was a monument to past injustice and a cornerstone for future vengeance."

            "The chapter opens with a vivid description of a small, rundown inn named Pont du Gard, located between Beaucaire and Bellegarde, its business severely impacted by a newly built canal.",
            "The inn's garden is depicted as neglected, with struggling olive and fig trees, reflecting the general state of decay and the harshness of the Mistral wind.",
            "The inn had been run by Gaspard Caderousse and his wife for seven or eight years, with minimal staff—Trinette the chambermaid and Pecaud the hostler—but the canal's success was leading to their financial ruin.",
            "Gaspard Caderousse is introduced as a tall, strong man in his late forties or early fifties, with characteristic southern features, constantly watching for scarce customers from his doorway under a red handkerchief, his complexion darkened by the sun.",
            "His wife, Madeleine Radelle, called La Carconte due to her birthplace, is pale and sickly, suffering from a chronic fever prevalent in the marshy regions near Arles. She is often confined to her room, lamenting their fate.",
            "Caderousse outwardly responds to his wife's complaints with philosophical resignation, attributing their hardship to God's will, but inwardly struggles with the loss of business and her constant negativity.",
            "A flashback reveals their former prosperity, when they enjoyed local festivities in fine attire—Caderousse in picturesque southern costume and La Carconte in the fashion of Arles women. This contrasts sharply with their current impoverished state where they can no longer afford such displays, leaving Caderousse with bitter envy."

This modern place of entertainment stood on the left-hand side of the post road, and backed upon the Rhône. It also boasted of what in Languedoc is styled a garden, consisting of a small plot of ground, on the side opposite to the main entrance reserved for the reception of guests. A few dingy olives and stunted fig-trees struggled hard for existence, but their withered dusty foliage abundantly proved how unequal was the conflict. Between these sickly shrubs grew a scanty supply of garlic, tomatoes, and eschalots; while, lone and solitary, like a forgotten sentinel, a tall pine raised its melancholy head in one of the corners of this unattractive spot, and displayed its flexible stem and fan-shaped summit dried and cracked by the fierce heat of the sub-tropical sun.\nAll these trees, great or small, were turned in the direction to which the Mistral blows, one of the three curses of Provence, the others being the Durance and the Parliament.\nIn the surrounding plain, which more resembled a dusty lake than solid ground, were scattered a few miserable stalks of wheat, the effect, no doubt, of a curious desire on the part of the agriculturists of the country to see whether such a thing as the raising of grain in those parched regions was practicable. Each stalk served as a perch for a grasshopper, which regaled the passers-by through this Egyptian scene with its strident, monotonous note.\nFor about seven or eight years the little tavern had been kept by a man and his wife, with two servants,—a chambermaid named Trinette, and a hostler called Pecaud. This small staff was quite equal to all the requirements, for a canal between Beaucaire and Aiguemortes had revolutionized transportation by substituting boats for the cart and the stagecoach. And, as though to add to the daily misery which this prosperous canal inflicted on the unfortunate innkeeper, whose utter ruin it was fast accomplishing, it was situated between the Rhône from which it had its source and the post-road it had depleted, not a hundred steps from the inn, of which we have given a brief but faithful description.\nThe innkeeper himself was a man of from forty to fifty-five years of age, tall, strong, and bony, a perfect specimen of the natives of those southern latitudes; he had dark, sparkling, and deep-set eyes, hooked nose, and teeth white as those of a carnivorous animal; his hair, like his beard, which he wore under his chin, was thick and curly, and in spite of his age but slightly interspersed with a few silvery threads. His naturally dark complexion had assumed a still further shade of brown from the habit the unfortunate man had acquired of stationing himself from morning till eve at the threshold of his door, on the lookout for guests who seldom came, yet there he stood, day after day, exposed to the meridional rays of a burning sun, with no other protection for his head than a red handkerchief twisted around it, after the manner of the Spanish muleteers. This man was our old acquaintance, Gaspard Caderousse.\nHis wife, on the contrary, whose maiden name had been Madeleine Radelle, was pale, meagre, and sickly-looking. Born in the neighborhood of Arles, she had shared in the beauty for which its women are proverbial; but that beauty had gradually withered beneath the devastating influence of the slow fever so prevalent among dwellers by the ponds of Aiguemortes and the marshes of Camargue. She remained nearly always in her second-floor chamber, shivering in her chair, or stretched languid and feeble on her bed, while her husband kept his daily watch at the door—a duty he performed with so much the greater willingness, as it saved him the necessity of listening to the endless plaints and murmurs of his helpmate, who never saw him without breaking out into bitter invectives against fate; to all of which her husband would calmly return an unvarying reply, in these philosophic words:\n“Hush, La Carconte. It is God’s pleasure that things should be so.”\nThe sobriquet of La Carconte had been bestowed on Madeleine Radelle from the fact that she had been born in a village, so called, situated between Salon and Lambesc; and as a custom existed among the inhabitants of that part of France where Caderousse lived of styling every person by some particular and distinctive appellation, her husband had bestowed on her the name of La Carconte in place of her sweet and euphonious name of Madeleine, which, in all probability, his rude gutteral language would not have enabled him to pronounce.\nStill, let it not be supposed that amid this affected resignation to the will of Providence, the unfortunate innkeeper did not writhe under the double misery of seeing the hateful canal carry off his customers and his profits, and the daily infliction of his peevish partner’s murmurs and lamentations.\nLike other dwellers in the south, he was a man of sober habits and moderate desires, but fond of external show, vain, and addicted to display. During the days of his prosperity, not a festivity took place without himself and wife being among the spectators. He dressed in the picturesque costume worn upon grand occasions by the inhabitants of the south of France, bearing equal resemblance to the style adopted both by the Catalans and Andalusians; while La Carconte displayed the charming fashion prevalent among the women of Arles, a mode of attire borrowed equally from Greece and Arabia. But, by degrees, watch-chains, necklaces, parti-colored scarves, embroidered bodices, velvet vests, elegantly worked stockings, striped gaiters, and silver buckles for the shoes, all disappeared; and Gaspard Caderousse, unable to appear abroad in his pristine splendor, had given up any further participation in the pomps and vanities, both for himself and wife, although a bitter feeling of envious discontent filled his mind as the sound of mirth and merry music from the joyous revellers reached even the miserable hostelry to which he still clung, more for the shelter than the profit it afforded.",

This inn, from the time it was first built, had been called the Pont du Gard Inn, and for the last seven or eight years had been kept by Gaspard Caderousse and his wife Madeleine Radelle. These people, who belonged to the class of innkeepers, and who, like all persons of their calling living at a distance from large cities, were accustomed to exercise their profession with a rigour that was seldom, if ever, relaxed, had become rich by the exercise of strict economy, and were now on the high road to a handsome independence. The canal of Beaucaire, however, which had been in existence about two years, had been a terrible blow to their prosperity. Before this, the road which passed their door had been the highway from Nîmes to Beaucaire, and from Beaucaire to Nîmes, and consequently the resort of all travellers going from or coming to Beaucaire, and especially of those who were going to or coming from the fair, which is held there every year on the 29th of June. But since the canal had been opened, the greater part of the traffic had been diverted into this new channel, and the inn of the Pont du Gard was now deserted. The garden, which had formerly been a source of great profit to the innkeeper, was now neglected; the olive-trees and fig-trees, which had formerly been so carefully tended, were now left to themselves; the vines, which had formerly been so luxuriantly cultivated, were now allowed to run wild; and the whole place wore an air of desolation and decay. The Mistral, that terrible wind of the south, which blows with such violence in the valley of the Rhône, had swept over the garden, and had left nothing but ruin and devastation behind it. The inn itself was in a state of dilapidation; the walls were cracked, the roof was falling in, and the windows were broken. The furniture was old and worn out; the beds were hard and uncomfortable; and the whole place had a miserable and poverty-stricken appearance. Gaspard Caderousse was a man of about forty-five or fifty years of age, tall and strong, with a dark complexion, and a face which was deeply furrowed by the sun and the wind. He wore a red handkerchief tied round his head, and a blue blouse, which was open at the neck, and showed his broad chest.

There it lay stretching out into one interminable line of dust and sand, with its sides bordered by tall, meagre trees, altogether presenting so uninviting an appearance, that no one in his senses could have imagined that any traveller, at liberty to regulate his hours for journeying, would choose to expose himself in such a formidable Sahara.\nNevertheless, had Caderousse but retained his post a few minutes longer, he might have caught a dim outline of something approaching from the direction of Bellegarde; as the moving object drew nearer, he would easily have perceived that it consisted of a man and horse, between whom the kindest and most amiable understanding appeared to exist. The horse was of Hungarian breed, and ambled along at an easy pace. His rider was a priest, dressed in black, and wearing a three-cornered hat; and, spite of the ardent rays of a noonday sun, the pair came on with a fair degree of rapidity.\nHaving arrived before the Pont du Gard, the horse stopped, but whether for his own pleasure or that of his rider would have been difficult to say. However that might have been, the priest, dismounting, led his steed by the bridle in search of some place to which he could secure him. Availing himself of a handle that projected from a half-fallen door, he tied the animal safely and having drawn a red cotton handkerchief, from his pocket, wiped away the perspiration that streamed from his brow, then, advancing to the door, struck thrice with the end of his iron-shod stick.\nAt this unusual sound, a huge black dog came rushing to meet the daring assailant of his ordinarily tranquil abode, snarling and displaying his sharp white teeth with a determined hostility that abundantly proved how little he was accustomed to society. At that moment a heavy footstep was heard descending the wooden staircase that led from the upper floor, and, with many bows and courteous smiles, the host of the Pont du Gard besought his guest to enter.\n“You are welcome, sir, most welcome!” repeated the astonished Caderousse. “Now, then, Margotin,” cried he, speaking to the dog, “will you be quiet? Pray don’t heed him, sir!—he only barks, he never bites. I make no doubt a glass of good wine would be acceptable this dreadfully hot day.” Then perceiving for the first time the garb of the traveller he had to entertain, Caderousse hastily exclaimed: “A thousand pardons! I really did not observe whom I had the honor to receive under my poor roof. What would the abbé please to have? What refreshment can I offer? All I have is at his service.”",

The road which led to the Pont du Gard is one of the most unfrequented in France, and during the hottest hours of the day, in summer, the heat is insupportable. It was broad noon, and the sun scorched the earth; there was not a cloud in the sky. The lower animals avoided the heat of the day by concealing themselves in the shade; and man, the lord of the creation, who cannot command nature, submitted to it by lying hidden in his house, like the inferior animals. Suddenly, in the distance, Caderousse observed a living being on the road. It was a priest, dressed in black, and mounted on a Hungarian horse, which ambled along at an easy pace. In an instant Caderousse was at his door, and a moment after the priest had stopped at the inn. The priest dismounted, passed the bridle of his horse into a ring fixed in the wall, and, wiping his forehead with a handkerchief, came to the door, which was still open. At the moment he reached it, a large black dog, of the bull-dog breed, which had hitherto been lying asleep in the sun, uttered a savage growl, and, springing up, placed himself in front of the doorway, displaying a set of teeth that might have alarmed any one not used to such encounters. But the priest, without manifesting the least fear, and keeping his hand on the stick which he held, waited until Caderousse should come and silence the animal. Caderousse came, and, in a fawning tone, bade the dog lie down, which the animal obeyed, not, however, without casting a suspicious look at the new-comer. Caderousse then began to apologize for the dog's behaviour, and assured the abbé that the animal never bit, except in play. 'Provided his play does not make any one serious, it is all I require,' said the abbé, with a slight smile. 'And now, sir, what can I have the pleasure of doing for you?' said Caderousse. 'You can give me a glass of wine, and that the best you have. Afterwards, you will be good enough to furnish me with the information I require.' 'Oh, willingly, willingly!' said Caderousse, 'seeing that your reverence is so good a judge of wine; and I have some which you will find excellent.' The abbé drew a louis from his pocket, and offered it to Caderousse. 'No, no, your reverence,' said Caderousse, pushing back the gold; 'I do not make a trade of it.' 'You are right, my friend,' said the abbé; 'and God forbid that I should endeavour to corrupt your worthy sentiments. I will not insist upon it, therefore; but you said you had some information to give me.' 'Yes, yes, your reverence; but you must tell me what you want to know. Let us go into the house, if you please, for it is dreadfully hot outside, and my wife is upstairs, and will be delighted to see your reverence.'

You formerly lived, I believe in the Allées de Meilhan, on the fourth floor?”\n“I did.”\n“And you followed the business of a tailor?”\n“True, I was a tailor, till the trade fell off. It is so hot at Marseilles, that really I believe that the respectable inhabitants will in time go without any clothing whatever. But talking of heat, is there nothing I can offer you by way of refreshment?”\n“Yes; let me have a bottle of your best wine, and then, with your permission, we will resume our conversation from where we left off.”\n“As you please, sir,” said Caderousse, who, anxious not to lose the present opportunity of finding a customer for one of the few bottles of Cahors still remaining in his possession, hastily raised a trap-door in the floor of the apartment they were in, which served both as parlor and kitchen.\nUpon issuing forth from his subterranean retreat at the expiration of five minutes, he found the abbé seated upon a wooden stool, leaning his elbow on a table, while Margotin, whose animosity seemed appeased by the unusual command of the traveller for refreshments, had crept up to him, and had established himself very comfortably between his knees, his long, skinny neck resting on his lap, while his dim eye was fixed earnestly on the traveller’s face.\n“Are you quite alone?” inquired the guest, as Caderousse placed before him the bottle of wine and a glass.\n“Quite, quite alone,” replied the man—“or, at least, practically so, for my poor wife, who is the only person in the house besides myself, is laid up with illness, and unable to render me the least assistance, poor thing!”\n“You are married, then?” said the priest, with a show of interest, glancing round as he spoke at the scanty furnishings of the apartment.\n“Ah, sir,” said Caderousse with a sigh, “it is easy to perceive I am not a rich man; but in this world a man does not thrive the better for being honest.” The abbé fixed on him a searching, penetrating glance.\n“Yes, honest—I can certainly say that much for myself,” continued the innkeeper, fairly sustaining the scrutiny of the abbé’s gaze; “I can boast with truth of being an honest man; and,” continued he significantly, with a hand on his breast and shaking his head, “that is more than everyone can say nowadays.”\n“So much the better for you, if what you assert be true,” said the abbé; “for I am firmly persuaded that, sooner or later, the good will be rewarded, and the wicked punished.”\n“Such words as those belong to your profession,” answered Caderousse, “and you do well to repeat them; but,” added he, with a bitter expression of countenance, “one is free to believe them or not, as one pleases.”\n“You are wrong to speak thus,” said the abbé; “and perhaps I may, in my own person, be able to prove to you how completely you are in error.”",

I don’t know him. Never heard of an Abbé Faria.”\n\n“He was the fellow-prisoner of Edmond Dantès,” the priest continued, his voice low and steady.\n\nA flicker of recognition, mixed with fear, crossed Caderousse’s face. “Edmond Dantès? Ah, yes, I knew him. Poor Edmond! A fine young fellow. But what has this Abbé Faria to do with me?”\n\n“The Abbé Faria died a few months ago,” the priest explained. “Before he died, he spoke much of Edmond Dantès, his friend and companion in misfortune. He knew that Dantès had been unjustly imprisoned, and he wished to leave a legacy to those who had been loyal to him, and to understand the roles of those who had wronged him.”\n\nCaderousse’s eyes widened slightly at the mention of a legacy. “A legacy? To whom?”\n\n“To those who were true friends to Edmond,” the priest repeated. “He possessed a considerable fortune, hidden long ago. He entrusted me with a portion of it, a diamond of great value, to be given to the most deserving of Edmond’s friends.” He paused, allowing the word ‘diamond’ to sink in.\n\nCaderousse’s drunkenness seemed to recede slightly, replaced by a greedy glint in his eyes. “A diamond, you say? Of great value? And you have it?”\n\n“I have it,” confirmed the priest. “But the Abbé Faria was a man of justice. He wished to know the truth about Edmond’s fate. He knew that Edmond was denounced, but not by whom, or why. He asked me to seek out those who knew Edmond well in Marseille and learn the full story. He believed that those who were truly innocent would be rewarded, and those who were guilty would face divine judgment.”\n\nHe leaned forward slightly. “You, M. Caderousse, were present on the day of Edmond’s arrest. You were at the wedding feast. The Abbé Faria believed you could shed light on the events of that day. He wanted to know who wrote the letter of denunciation, and who delivered it.”\n\nCaderousse shifted uneasily, glancing around the empty room. The prospect of the diamond warred with a deep-seated fear. “The"

          "text_segment": "“What mean you?” inquired Caderousse with a look of surprise.\n“In the first place, I must be satisfied that you are the person I am in search of.”\n“What proofs do you require?”\n“Did you, in the year 1814 or 1815, know anything of a young sailor named Dantès?”\n“Dantès? Did I know poor dear Edmond? Why, Edmond Dantès and myself were intimate friends!” exclaimed Caderousse, whose countenance flushed darkly as he caught the penetrating gaze of the abbé fixed on him, while the clear, calm eye of the questioner seemed to dilate with feverish scrutiny.\n“You remind me,” said the priest, “that the young man concerning whom I asked you was said to bear the name of Edmond.”\n“Said to bear the name!” repeated Caderousse, becoming excited and eager. “Why, he was so called as truly as I myself bore the appellation of Gaspard Caderousse; but tell me, I pray, what has become of poor Edmond? Did you know him? Is he alive and at liberty? Is he prosperous and happy?”\n“He died a more wretched, hopeless, heart-broken prisoner than the felons who pay the penalty of their crimes at the galleys of Toulon.”\nA deadly pallor followed the flush on the countenance of Caderousse, who turned away, and the priest saw him wiping the tears from his eyes with the corner of the red handkerchief twisted round his head.\n“Poor fellow, poor fellow!” murmured Caderousse. “Well, there, sir, is another proof that good people are never rewarded on this earth, and that none but the wicked prosper. Ah,” continued Caderousse, speaking in the highly colored language of the South, “the world grows worse and worse. Why does not God, if he really hates the wicked, as he is said to do, send down brimstone and fire, and consume them altogether?”\n“You speak as though you had loved this young Dantès,” observed the abbé, without taking any notice of his companion’s vehemence.\n“And so I did,” replied Caderousse; “though once, I confess, I envied him his good fortune. But I swear to you, sir, I swear to you, by everything a man holds dear, I have, since then, deeply and sincerely lamented his unhappy fate.”\nThere was a brief silence, during which the fixed, searching eye of the abbé was employed in scrutinizing the agitated features of the innkeeper.\n“You knew the poor lad, then?” continued Caderousse.\n“I was called to see him on his dying bed, that I might administer to him the consolations of religion.”\n“And of what did he die?” asked Caderousse in a choking voice.\n“Of what, think you, do young and strong men die in prison, when they have scarcely numbered their thirtieth year, unless it be of imprisonment?” Caderousse wiped away the large beads of perspiration that gathered on his brow.\n“But the strangest part of the story is,” resumed the abbé, “that Dantès, even in his dying moments, swore by his crucified Redeemer, that he was utterly ignorant of the cause of his detention.”\n“And so he was,” murmured Caderousse. “How should he have been otherwise? Ah, sir, the poor fellow told you the truth.”\n“And for that reason, he besought me to try and clear up a mystery he had never been able to penetrate, and to clear his memory should any foul spot or stain have fallen on it.”\nAnd here the look of the abbé, becoming more and more fixed, seemed to rest with ill-concealed satisfaction on the gloomy depression which was rapidly spreading over the countenance of Caderousse.\n“A rich Englishman,” continued the abbé, “who had been his companion in misfortune, but had been released from prison during the second restoration, was possessed of a diamond of immense value; this jewel he bestowed on Dantès upon himself quitting the prison, as a mark of his gratitude for the kindness and brotherly care with which Dantès had nursed him in a severe illness he underwent during his confinement. Instead of employing this diamond in attempting to bribe his jailers, who might only have taken it and then betrayed him to the governor, Dantès carefully preserved it, that in the event of his getting out of prison he might have wherewithal to live, for the sale of such a diamond would have quite sufficed to make his fortune.”\n“Then, I suppose,” asked Caderousse, with eager, glowing looks, “that it was a stone of immense value?”\n“Why, everything is relative,” answered the abbé. “To one in Edmond’s position the diamond certainly was of great value. It was estimated at fifty thousand francs.”\n“Bless me!” exclaimed Caderousse, “fifty thousand francs! Surely the diamond was as large as a nut to be worth all that.”\n“No,” replied the abbé, “it was not of such a size as that; but you shall judge for yourself. I have it with me.”\nThe sharp gaze of Caderousse was instantly directed towards the priest’s garments, as though hoping to discover the location of the treasure. Calmly drawing forth from his pocket a small box covered with black shagreen, the abbé opened it, and displayed to the dazzled eyes of Caderousse the sparkling jewel it contained, set in a ring of admirable workmanship.\n“And that diamond,” cried Caderousse, almost breathless with eager admiration, “you say, is worth fifty thousand francs?”\n“It is, without the setting, which is also valuable,” replied the abbé, as he closed the box, and returned it to his pocket, while its brilliant hues seemed still to dance before the eyes of the fascinated innkeeper.",

His eyes, which had been sparkling, were now dull and heavy. He rose from his seat, and, with a trembling voice, exclaimed, “Edmond Dantès! Do you know him? Is he alive? Is he at liberty? Is he rich? Is he happy?” “He is dead,” replied the abbé, in a low, solemn voice. Caderousse uttered a cry, and fell back in his chair. “Dead!” he repeated, “dead! And how did he die? Of what did he die?” “He died,” replied the abbé, “of a broken heart, in a dungeon, after eighteen years of captivity.” Caderousse groaned. “Poor Edmond!” he murmured, “poor Edmond! And I—I who was his friend—I who loved him so well—I have done nothing for him! I have abandoned him! I have forgotten him!” “You have done more than that,” said the abbé, in a stern voice. “You have betrayed him.” Caderousse started. “Betrayed him!” he exclaimed. “I! Never!” “Yes, you,” replied the abbé. “You were present when he was arrested. You knew the cause of his arrest. You knew the names of his accusers. You knew that he was innocent. And you did nothing to save him.” Caderousse covered his face with his hands. “It is true,” he sobbed, “it is true! I was a coward! I was a wretch! I was a monster!” “And yet,” said the abbé, in a milder tone, “he loved you. He believed in you. He confided in you. And even in his dying moments, he spoke of you.” Caderousse raised his head. “He spoke of me?” he faltered. “What did he say?” “He said,” replied the abbé, “that he forgave you. He said that he knew you were not a bad man, but a weak one. He said that he hoped you would repent, and that God would forgive you.” Caderousse wept aloud. “Oh, Edmond!” he cried, “my poor Edmond! I will repent! I will pray for you! I will do all that I can to atone for my crime!” “It is not for me to judge you,” said the abbé. “God alone can do that. But I can tell you that Edmond Dantès, in his dying moments, confided to me a secret. He told me that he had a treasure hidden somewhere. He did not tell me where it was hidden, but he told me that it was a very great treasure, and that it belonged to him alone.” Caderousse’s eyes sparkled. “A treasure!” he exclaimed. “A very great treasure! And where is it hidden?” “I do not know,” replied the abbé. “But I know that it exists. And I know that it is yours, if you can find it.” Caderousse rose from his seat, and paced the room with rapid strides. “A treasure!” he repeated, “a treasure! And it is mine! Mine, if I can find it!” He stopped before the abbé, and, with a wild look, exclaimed, “But how can I find it? Where shall I look?” “That is for you to discover,” replied the abbé. “But I can give you a clue. Edmond Dantès told me that the treasure was hidden in a place that he loved very much. He said that it was a place where he had spent many happy hours. He said that it was a place that was dearer to him than any other place in the world.” Caderousse thought for a moment. “A place that he loved very much,” he murmured. “A place where he had spent many happy hours. A place that was dearer to him than any other place in the world.” Suddenly, his face brightened. “I know!” he exclaimed. “I know where it is hidden! It is in the little garden behind his house! The garden where he used to play when he was a child! The garden where he used to meet Mercédès!” “You are mistaken,” said the abbé. “It is not there.” Caderousse’s face fell. “Then where is it?” he asked. “I have told you that I do not know,” replied the abbé. “But I can tell you this: Edmond Dantès told me that the treasure was hidden in a place that was very difficult to find. He said that it was a place that no one would ever think of looking in.” Caderousse thought again. “A place that was very difficult to find,” he murmured. “A place that no one would ever think of looking in.” Suddenly, his eyes fell upon the abbé’s ring. It was a large diamond, which sparkled with a thousand fires. “That ring!” he exclaimed. “Is that the treasure?” “No,” replied the abbé. “This ring is mine. But it is a proof that the treasure exists.” He took off the ring, and handed it to Caderousse. “Look at it,” he said. “It is worth fifty thousand francs.” Caderousse’s eyes were dazzled by the brilliance of the stone. “Fifty thousand francs!” he repeated. “It is impossible!” “It is true,” said the abbé. “And this is but a small part of the treasure that Edmond Dantès has left behind him.” He took the ring from Caderousse, and replaced it on his finger. “Now,” he said, “do you",

And how did he die? Of what did he die?” “He died,” replied the abbé, “as young and strong men die in prison, when they have been long there, and have lost all hope; he died of imprisonment, of despair, of a broken heart.” Caderousse groaned. “Poor Edmond!” he repeated. “And I—I who was his friend—I who loved him so well—I have done nothing for him!” “You say you were his friend?” said the abbé. “Yes, his friend,” replied Caderousse; “we were children together, we were sailors together, we were friends together.” “And yet,” said the abbé, “when he was arrested, you did nothing for him.” “I was afraid,” replied Caderousse; “I was a coward. But I loved him, nevertheless.” “And he,” continued the abbé, “even in his dying moments, swore to me that he was ignorant of the cause of his detention. He implored me, by the most sacred ties, to clear his memory of any stain, and to investigate the mystery of his fate. And I—I have promised him that I would do so.” Caderousse listened with a haggard look. “And you believe him?” he asked. “I do,” replied the abbé. “And I am here to-day to keep my promise.” He paused for a moment, and then continued, “Edmond Dantès had a friend in prison, a rich Englishman, who was released during the second restoration. This Englishman, in gratitude for the care which Dantès had taken of him during an illness, gave him a diamond of immense value. Dantès preserved it for his future use.” Caderousse’s eyes sparkled. “A diamond of immense value!” he exclaimed. “Yes,” replied the abbé, “of immense value to a man in Edmond’s position. It was estimated at fifty thousand francs.” Caderousse uttered a cry of astonishment. “Fifty thousand francs!” he repeated. “It is impossible!” “It is true,” said the abbé. “It was not, it is true, as large as a nut, but it was a stone of the first water.” He drew from his pocket a small black shagreen box, opened it, and displayed to the dazzled eyes of Caderousse a magnificent jewel, set in a ring. “Look at it,” he said. “It is a diamond of the first water, and it is worth fifty thousand francs.” Caderousse was breathless with admiration. “It is true,” he murmured, “it is true. It is a magnificent stone.” “And the setting is also valuable,” added the abbé, as he closed the box and replaced it in his pocket. Caderousse remained fascinated.",

The sequence where the abbé forgets the name of the betrothed and Caderousse supplies it is missing.\n- The completion invents a formal listing of the friends with occupations and locations, which is not present in the original passage.\n- The request for water and the subsequent pause in the conversation are not included, removing a key structural moment that breaks up the dialogue and adds realism to the scene.\n\n2. MISSING ELEMENTS:\n- The completion lacks the detailed recounting of Edmond's sentiments about his friends and the specific mention of their emotional responses to his loss.\n- The emotional reactions of Caderousse, such as shivering and his fiendish smile, are not present.\n- The abbé's interruption of Caderousse and the instruction to let him finish before responding are omitted.\n- The moment where the abbé forgets the name of the betrothed and Caderousse eagerly supplies it is missing, as is the abbé's acknowledgment of this correction.\n- The act of bringing water, the abbé drinking, and the resumption of the conversation are not included.\n- The explicit repetition of Edmond's instructions, including the directive to go to a specific location and the process of dividing the diamond's value, is not fully represented.\n\n3. INACCURATE ELEMENTS:\n- The completion inaccurately attributes the listing of friends and their occupations to the abbé, which does not occur in the original.\n- The sequence of events is altered: the completion presents the list of friends and the explanation of the diamond's division before the emotional and interactive elements between the abbé and Caderousse, disrupting the original order.\n- The completion simplifies the explanation of the five shares, omitting the clarification and reasoning provided in the original dialogue.\n- The completion introduces invented dialogue, such as the abbé stating he has come to bring Caderousse his share, which is not present in the original passage."

The very dogs that wander houseless and homeless in the streets find some pitying hand to cast them a mouthful of bread; and that a man, a Christian, should be allowed to perish of hunger in the midst of other men who call themselves Christians, is too horrible for belief.

Better study a little common prudence. How do you know the motives that person may have for trying to extract all he can from you?”\n“I pledge you my word, madam,” said the abbé, “that my intentions are good; and that your husband can incur no risk, provided he answers me candidly.”\n“Ah, that’s all very fine,” retorted the woman. “Nothing is easier than to begin with fair promises and assurances of nothing to fear; but when poor, silly folks, like my husband there, have been persuaded to tell all they know, the promises and assurances of safety are quickly forgotten; and at some moment when nobody is expecting it, behold trouble and misery, and all sorts of persecutions, are heaped on the unfortunate wretches, who cannot even see whence all their afflictions come.”\n“Nay, nay, my good woman, make yourself perfectly easy, I beg of you. Whatever evils may befall you, they will not be occasioned by my instrumentality, that I solemnly promise you.”\nLa Carconte muttered a few inarticulate words, then let her head again drop upon her knees, and went into a fit of ague, leaving the two speakers to resume the conversation, but remaining so as to be able to hear every word they uttered.

I will tell him that you were all afraid of the police, and that you left the poor old man to die alone, in his misery, in his despair, in his hunger!”\n“Silence, I say!” repeated Caderousse, raising his hand.\n“No, no,” said La Carconte, with a wild laugh; “you cannot silence me. I am not afraid of you. I am not afraid of the police. I am not afraid of anything. I am only afraid of God, and I know that God will punish you for your wickedness!”\nAnd with these words, she fell back, exhausted, on the stairs, and remained there, groaning and trembling.\n“You see,” said Caderousse, “she is mad.

And… and hunger.”\n\n“Hunger?” the Abbé’s voice was low, devoid of emotion, yet it seemed to vibrate with an intensity that made Caderousse flinch. “A man dies of hunger in the heart of Marseille? A man whose son had just been promised a fortune, a captaincy, a life of ease?”\n\n“Ah, but that was the cruelest part, wasn’t it?” Caderousse burst out, a bitter, self-pitying laugh escaping him. “The old man waited. He waited for Edmond to come back, to bring him the happiness he’d promised. But Edmond never came. And the old man… he just faded away. He wouldn’t eat. He said he couldn’t swallow when his boy was in trouble. He just sat there, day after day, in that little room, his eyes fixed on the door, hoping.”\n\n“And you, Caderousse?” the Abbé prompted, his gaze unwavering. “You were his neighbour. You saw his suffering. Did you offer him bread? Did you offer him comfort?”\n\nCaderousse squirmed. “I… I was poor myself, Abbé. Things were hard. And… and Danglars, he said it was no business of ours. He said Dantès was a Bonapartist, a traitor, and his father would get what he deserved.” He paused, a flicker of genuine shame crossing his face before being replaced by a defensive scowl. “Besides, the old man was proud. He wouldn’t take charity easily.”\n\n“Charity?” The Abbé’s tone sharpened slightly. “Was it charity to help the father of a man who had shared his last coin with you? A man who had considered you a friend?”\n\nCaderousse’s face paled. “He… he did leave some money, didn’t he? Before he sailed on the Pharaon. A few louis, for his father.”\n\n“Precisely,” said the Abbé. “A sum intended to keep the old man comfortable until his return. What became of that money, Caderousse?”\n\nCaderousse hesitated, licking his dry lips. The memory was clearly painful, not from remorse, but from the fear of consequences. “It… it was there. In a little purse. The old man kept it. But he wouldn’t touch it. He said it was Edmond’s money, and he was saving it for him.”\n\n“So, the money was there, and the man died of hunger?” the Abbé’s voice was dangerously quiet. “And you, his neighbour, knowing of the money, knowing of his need, did nothing?”\n\n“What could I do?” Caderousse whined. “He wouldn’t eat! He just wasted away. And after he died… well, the landlord took some of the money for the rent he was owed. And the rest… it just disappeared. Things get lost, you know, in times like that.”"

          "text_segment": "When he had sufficiently recovered himself, he said, “It appears, then, that the miserable old man you were telling me of was forsaken by everyone. Surely, had not such been the case, he would not have perished by so dreadful a death.”\n“Why, he was not altogether forsaken,” continued Caderousse, “for Mercédès the Catalan and Monsieur Morrel were very kind to him; but somehow the poor old man had contracted a profound hatred for Fernand—the very person,” added Caderousse with a bitter smile, “that you named just now as being one of Dantès’ faithful and attached friends.”\n“And was he not so?” asked the abbé.\n“Gaspard, Gaspard!” murmured the woman, from her seat on the stairs, “mind what you are saying!”\nCaderousse made no reply to these words, though evidently irritated and annoyed by the interruption, but, addressing the abbé, said, “Can a man be faithful to another whose wife he covets and desires for himself? But Dantès was so honorable and true in his own nature, that he believed everybody’s professions of friendship. Poor Edmond, he was cruelly deceived; but it was fortunate that he never knew, or he might have found it more difficult, when on his deathbed, to pardon his enemies. And, whatever people may say,” continued Caderousse, in his native language, which was not altogether devoid of rude poetry, “I cannot help being more frightened at the idea of the malediction of the dead than the hatred of the living.”\n“Imbecile!” exclaimed La Carconte.\n“Do you, then, know in what manner Fernand injured Dantès?” inquired the abbé of Caderousse.\n“Do I? No one better.”\n“Speak out then, say what it was!”\n“Gaspard!” cried La Carconte, “do as you will; you are master—but if you take my advice you’ll hold your tongue.”\n“Well, wife,” replied Caderousse, “I don’t know but what you’re right!”\n“So you will say nothing?” asked the abbé.\n“Why, what good would it do?” asked Caderousse. “If the poor lad were living, and came to me and begged that I would candidly tell which were his true and which his false friends, why, perhaps, I should not hesitate. But you tell me he is no more, and therefore can have nothing to do with hatred or revenge, so let all such feeling be buried with him.”\n“You prefer, then,” said the abbé, “that I should bestow on men you say are false and treacherous, the reward intended for faithful friendship?”\n“That is true enough,” returned Caderousse. “You say truly, the gift of poor Edmond was not meant for such traitors as Fernand and Danglars; besides, what would it be to them? no more than a drop of water in the ocean.”\n“Remember,” chimed in La Carconte, “those two could crush you at a single blow!”\n“How so?” inquired the abbé. “Are these persons, then, so rich and powerful?”\n“Do you not know their history?”\n“I do not. Pray relate it to me!”\nCaderousse seemed to reflect for a few moments, then said, “No, truly, it would take up too much time.”\n“Well, my good friend,” returned the abbé, in a tone that indicated utter indifference on his part, “you are at liberty, either to speak or be silent, just as you please; for my own part, I respect your scruples and admire your sentiments; so let the matter end. I shall do my duty as conscientiously as I can, and fulfil my promise to the dying man. My first business will be to dispose of this diamond.”\nSo saying, the abbé again drew the small box from his pocket, opened it, and contrived to hold it in such a light, that a bright flash of brilliant hues passed before the dazzled gaze of Caderousse.",

Morrel, the shipowner, who was very kind to him.”“Mercédès! ah, yes, I remember,” said the abbé; “he meant, I think, to marry her to young Dantès.”“Yes, sir; but you were deceived, as I was. Dantès intended to marry Mercédès, and was betrothed to her; but—”“But what?”“But she married Fernand, the Catalan; the very man,” said Caderousse, with a bitter smile, “whom Dantès so generously saved from the hands of the smugglers.”“How was that?” asked the abbé; “was this Fernand the friend of Edmond?”“His friend? say rather his evil genius! Sir,” added Caderousse, with that sense of importance which the poor attach to the names of the rich, and to their connection with them, “this Fernand, who was called by the Spaniards El Lagartijo, or the Lizard, was a fellow brought up with Edmond, and who enlisted in the service the same day.”“Go on,” said the abbé; “I am listening.”“Well, sir, this Fernand saw that Edmond was likely to marry the girl he loved, and become rich, and so he became his bitterest enemy; and this is how he managed it. You know that Edmond was arrested on the day of his betrothal, charged with being a Bonapartist agent?”“Yes, and that the charge was false,” said the abbé.“False; yes, but it was more than that—it was a treacherous denunciation, and that denunciation was written by Fernand.”“How can you assert that?” asked the abbé, with a slight tremor in his voice.“I can assert it, and I do assert it, and will soon prove it to you. The old man, my neighbour, died of grief.”“No, no,” said the abbé, “I think he died of hunger.”“From grief and hunger both. But what presses most on my conscience is that he died cursing Fernand.”“Then you believe that Fernand is the cause of the misfortunes of the father and son?”“I do.”“And Mercédès?” asked the abbé.“Mercédès was forced to marry Fernand—the old man was dying, and she thought Edmond was dead.”“Forced?”“Yes, forced.”“By whom? by her father, or the old man?”“No; by the circumstances, and by the will of Heaven, as it would seem. While she was weeping and watching over the dying old man, Fernand presented himself, and insisted on the fulfilment of her promise.”“Her promise! to whom?”“To Fernand, of course. When she married him, the old man had not been dead a month.”“So short a time as that?” said the abbé, with a sigh.“Yes, sir; and it is as I tell you. I was there, and saw it all.”“Were you, then, one of the friends of Edmond?”“I was his friend and his neighbour, and was present at his betrothal feast.”“And what became of you afterwards?”“Why, I went on with my trade, which is that of a tailor; and then I married La Carconte, the woman you see there, and who has just gone to bed.”“And you have been happy?”“Happy? no,” said Caderousse, shaking his head; “I have been very unhappy. My wife has been ill for a year, and I have been obliged to sell all I had to pay the doctor and the apothecary. I am now a beggar, and have nothing left but this inn, which is not worth a hundred francs.”“And you say that Fernand and Danglars are rich?”“Yes, sir; they are both rich—very rich.”“And you are poor?”“As you see.”“And you say that Fernand was the cause of the misfortunes of Edmond and his father?”“Yes, I do.”“And that he married Mercédès?”“Yes.”“And that he is rich?”“Yes.”“And that you are poor?”“Yes.”“Then,” said the abbé, “you are a very honest man.”“I am,” said Caderousse, “and I have always been so.”“And you say that you were present at the betrothal feast of Edmond and Mercédès?”“Yes.”“And that you saw Fernand write the denunciation?”“No, I did not see him write it; but I know he did.”“How do you know it?”“By the handwriting.”“The handwriting?”“Yes, the handwriting. I saw the letter, and I knew the handwriting.”“And you say that the old man died cursing Fernand?”“Yes, I do.”“And that Mercédès married Fernand?”“Yes.”“And that Fernand is rich?”“Yes.”“And that you are poor?”“Yes.”“Then,” said the abbé, “you are a very honest man.”“I am,” said Caderousse, “and I have always been so.”“And you say that you were present at the betrothal feast of Edmond and Mercédès?”“Yes.”“And that you saw Fernand write the denunciation?”“No, I did not see him write it; but I know he did.”“How do you know it?”“By the handwriting.”“The handwriting?”“Yes, the handwriting.

          "text_segment": "“Wife, wife!” cried he in a hoarse voice, “come here!”\n“Diamond!” exclaimed La Carconte, rising and descending to the chamber with a tolerably firm step; “what diamond are you talking about?”\n“Why, did you not hear all we said?” inquired Caderousse. “It is a beautiful diamond left by poor Edmond Dantès, to be sold, and the money divided between his father, Mercédès, his betrothed bride, Fernand, Danglars, and myself. The jewel is worth at least fifty thousand francs.”\n“Oh, what a magnificent jewel!” cried the astonished woman.\n“The fifth part of the profits from this stone belongs to us then, does it not?” asked Caderousse.\n“It does,” replied the abbé; “with the addition of an equal division of that part intended for the elder Dantès, which I believe myself at liberty to divide equally with the four survivors.”\n“And why among us four?” inquired Caderousse.\n“As being the friends Edmond esteemed most faithful and devoted to him.”\n“I don’t call those friends who betray and ruin you,” murmured the wife in her turn, in a low, muttering voice.\n“Of course not!” rejoined Caderousse quickly; “no more do I, and that was what I was observing to this gentleman just now. I said I looked upon it as a sacrilegious profanation to reward treachery, perhaps crime.”\n“Remember,” answered the abbé calmly, as he replaced the jewel and its case in the pocket of his cassock, “it is your fault, not mine, that I do so. You will have the goodness to furnish me with the address of both Fernand and Danglars, in order that I may execute Edmond’s last wishes.”\nThe agitation of Caderousse became extreme, and large drops of perspiration rolled from his heated brow. As he saw the abbé rise from his seat and go towards the door, as though to ascertain if his horse were sufficiently refreshed to continue his journey, Caderousse and his wife exchanged looks of deep meaning.\n“There, you see, wife,” said the former, “this splendid diamond might all be ours, if we chose!”\n“Do you believe it?”\n“Why, surely a man of his holy profession would not deceive us!”\n“Well,” replied La Carconte, “do as you like. For my part, I wash my hands of the affair.”\nSo saying, she once more climbed the staircase leading to her chamber, her body convulsed with chills, and her teeth rattling in her head, in spite of the intense heat of the weather. Arrived at the top stair, she turned round, and called out, in a warning tone, to her husband, “Gaspard, consider well what you are about to do!”\n“I have both reflected and decided,” answered he.\nLa Carconte then entered her chamber, the flooring of which creaked beneath her heavy, uncertain tread, as she proceeded towards her armchair, into which she fell as though exhausted.\n“Well,” asked the abbé, as he returned to the apartment below, “what have you made up your mind to do?”\n“To tell you all I know,” was the reply.\n“I certainly think you act wisely in so doing,” said the priest. “Not because I have the least desire to learn anything you may please to conceal from me, but simply that if, through your assistance, I could distribute the legacy according to the wishes of the testator, why, so much the better, that is all.”\n“I hope it may be so,” replied Caderousse, his face flushed with cupidity.\n“I am all attention,” said the abbé.\n“Stop a minute,” answered Caderousse; “we might be interrupted in the most interesting part of my story, which would be a pity; and it is as well that your visit hither should be made known only to ourselves.”\nWith these words he went stealthily to the door, which he closed, and, by way of still greater precaution, bolted and barred it, as he was accustomed to do at night.\nDuring this time the abbé had chosen his place for listening at his ease. He removed his seat into a corner of the room, where he himself would be in deep shadow, while the light would be fully thrown on the narrator; then, with head bent down and hands clasped, or rather clenched together, he prepared to give his whole attention to Caderousse, who seated himself on the little stool, exactly opposite to him.\n“Remember, this is no affair of mine,” said the trembling voice of La Carconte, as though through the flooring of her chamber she viewed the scene that was enacting below.\n“Enough, enough!” replied Caderousse; “say no more about it; I will take all the consequences upon myself.”\nAnd he began his story.",

Her husband’s voice, usually so resonant with authority or smooth with calculation, was now fractured, raw, and edged with a terror she had rarely heard, even in the most volatile moments of their shared financial ventures. She smoothed her dress, adjusted a stray curl, and entered the study, a room that had always seemed to her the very heart of his power, lined with ledgers and strongboxes, smelling faintly of paper and success.\n\nBut the room was not as she remembered it. Papers were scattered across the floor, not in neat piles, but as if thrown in a fit of madness. The large oak desk was a chaos of overturned inkwells, crumpled documents, and a single, half-empty decanter. And her husband… Danglars, the Baron Danglars, the man who had built an empire on numbers and nerve, stood by the window, his back to her, his shoulders slumped, his hands clenched into fists that trembled visibly. His usually immaculate attire was dishevelled, his face, when he finally turned, was a mask of grey, drawn skin, wild eyes, and a mouth twisted in a silent scream.\n\n“What is it, Baron?” she asked, her voice cool, though a prickle of unease began to crawl up her spine. “You sound… unwell.”\n\nHe laughed, a sound devoid of mirth, a dry, rattling cough. “Unwell? Oh, I am perfectly well, Madame. Never better! I am merely… ruined.”\n\nHe spat the word out as if it were poison. Ruined. The word hung in the air, heavy and suffocating. Madame Danglars felt the blood drain from her face. Ruined? Danglars? The richest banker in Paris? It was impossible.\n\n“What nonsense is this?” she demanded, stepping closer, trying to see the ledgers, the papers that told this impossible tale. “Explain yourself!”\n\n“Explain?” He turned fully now, gesturing wildly at the room, at the scattered papers. “It is all here! The explanation! The Spanish funds… vanished! Cavalcanti… a fraud, his millions a phantom! The investments I made… worthless! Every venture I touched in the last month… turned to dust! There was a run on the bank today, Madame! A run! And there was nothing… nothing to meet it!”\n\nHis voice rose to a frantic pitch. “Millions! Gone! Vanished into thin air! My fortune, your fortune, the fortunes of half of Paris entrusted to me… all gone!” He stumbled towards his desk, sweeping more papers onto the floor. “Look! These are the accounts! Lies! All lies! The figures don’t add up! They never did! Someone… someone has been manipulating everything!”\n\nMadame Danglars stared at him, her mind reeling. Ruined. Not just a setback, not a temporary difficulty, but utter, complete ruin. The luxurious life she had built, the social standing she had fought for, the independence her own financial dealings had afforded her… all built on the foundation of his wealth, which was now crumbling into dust.\n\n“But… how?” she whispered, her voice barely audible. “How could this happen? You are the Baron Danglars! You control everything!”\n\n“I controlled nothing!” he roared, his despair turning to fury"

            "She urged him to come live with her so she could care for him, but he refused, insisting he must remain in his house for Edmond's return, as his son loved him above all else.",
            "Caderousse overheard this exchange, having wished Mercédès would succeed, as the old man's constant footsteps gave him no rest.",
            "Caderousse admits he rarely tried to console old Dantès, who seemed to dislike his presence.",
            "One night, however, hearing the old man's sobs, Caderousse felt compelled to go to him, but found him praying with such eloquence and fervor that Caderousse, despite his own irreligious nature, was profoundly moved and reflected on the unbearable depth of a father's grief.",
            "Old Dantès became increasingly solitary, closing his door even to M. Morrel and Mercédès, convinced Edmond was dead and awaiting him.",
            "As people stopped visiting, Caderousse observed strangers leaving old Dantès's apartment with bundles, realizing he was selling his possessions to survive.",
            "Eventually, destitute and owing three quarters' rent, old Dantès was granted a final week before eviction.",
            "After three days of hearing him walk, Caderousse heard silence on the fourth day and, looking through the keyhole, saw old Dantès pale and ill.",

Oh, yes; I can see it all before me this moment.”\n“Was it not his betrothal feast?”\n“It was and the feast that began so gayly had a very sorrowful ending; a police commissary, followed by four soldiers, entered, and Dantès was arrested.”\n“Yes, and up to this point I know all,” said the priest. “Dantès himself only knew that which personally concerned him, for he never beheld again the five persons I have named to you, or heard mention of anyone of them.”\n“Well, when Dantès was arrested, Monsieur Morrel hastened to obtain the particulars, and they were very sad. The old man returned alone to his home, folded up his wedding suit with tears in his eyes, and paced up and down his chamber the whole day, and would not go to bed at all, for I was underneath him and heard him walking the whole night; and for myself, I assure you I could not sleep either, for the grief of the poor father gave me great uneasiness, and every step he took went to my heart as really as if his foot had pressed against my breast.\n“The next day Mercédès came to implore the protection of M. de Villefort; she did not obtain it, however, and went to visit the old man; when she saw him so miserable and heart-broken, having passed a sleepless night, and not touched food since the previous day, she wished him to go with her that she might take care of him; but the old man would not consent. ‘No,’ was the old man’s reply, ‘I will not leave this house, for my poor dear boy loves me better than anything in the world; and if he gets out of prison he will come and see me the first thing, and what would he think if I did not wait here for him?’ I heard all this from the window, for I was anxious that Mercédès should persuade the old man to accompany her, for his footsteps over my head night and day did not leave me a moment’s repose.”\n“But did you not go upstairs and try to console the poor old man?” asked the abbé.\n“Ah, sir,” replied Caderousse, “we cannot console those who will not be consoled, and he was one of these; besides, I know not why, but he seemed to dislike seeing me. One night, however, I heard his sobs, and I could not resist my desire to go up to him, but when I reached his door he was no longer weeping but praying. I cannot now repeat to you, sir, all the eloquent words and imploring language he made use of; it was more than piety, it was more than grief, and I, who am no canter, and hate the Jesuits, said then to myself, ‘It is really well, and I am very glad that I have not any children; for if I were a father and felt such excessive grief as the old man does, and did not find in my memory or heart all he is now saying, I should throw myself into the sea at once, for I could not bear it.’”\n“Poor father!” murmured the priest.\n“From day to day he lived on alone, and more and more solitary. M. Morrel and Mercédès came to see him, but his door was closed; and, although I was certain he was at home, he would not make any answer. One day, when, contrary to his custom, he had admitted Mercédès, and the poor girl, in spite of her own grief and despair, endeavored to console him, he said to her,—‘Be assured, my dear daughter, he is dead; and instead of expecting him, it is he who is awaiting us; I am quite happy, for I am the oldest, and of course shall see him first.’\n“However well disposed a person may be, why, you see we leave off after a time seeing persons who are in sorrow, they make one melancholy; and so at last old Dantès was left all to himself, and I only saw from time to time strangers go up to him and come down again with some bundle they tried to hide; but I guessed what these bundles were, and that he sold by degrees what he had to pay for his subsistence. At length the poor old fellow reached the end of all he had; he owed three quarters’ rent, and they threatened to turn him out; he begged for another week, which was granted to him. I know this, because the landlord came into my apartment when he left his.\n“For the first three days I heard him walking about as usual, but, on the fourth I heard nothing. I then resolved to go up to him at all risks. The door was closed, but I looked through the keyhole, and saw him so pale and haggard, that believing him very ill, I went and told M. Morrel and then ran on to Mercédès. They both came immediately, M. Morrel bringing a doctor, and the doctor said it was inflammation of the bowels, and ordered him a limited diet. I was there, too, and I never shall forget the old man’s smile at this prescription.\n“From that time he received all who came; he had an excuse for not eating any more; the doctor had put him on a diet.”\nThe abbé uttered a kind of groan.\n“The story interests you, does it not, sir?” inquired Caderousse.\n“Yes,” replied the abbé, “it is very affecting.”\n“Mercédès came again, and she found him so altered that she was even more anxious than before to have him taken to her own home. This was M. Morrel’s wish also, who would fain have conveyed the old man against his consent; but the old man resisted, and cried so that they were actually frightened. Mercédès remained, therefore, by his bedside, and M. Morrel went away, making a sign to the Catalan that he had left his purse on the chimney-piece; but, availing himself of the doctor’s order, the old man would not take any sustenance; at length (after nine days of despair and fasting), the old man died, cursing those who had caused his misery, and saying to Mercédès, ‘If you ever see my Edmond again, tell him I die blessing him.’”",

And first, as concerns his father, whom Edmond loved so dearly, and who returned his affection with equal warmth, the poor old man—well, you know the rest.”\n“No, I do not know the rest,” answered the abbé; “the little I do know has been gathered from vague reports. Edmond never talked to me about his father’s death.”\n“So much the better; it will the more affect you. After the arrest of Edmond, and just at the moment when M. Morrel was leaving the house to obtain information, old Dantès, whom we had left in the company of Mercédès, must have been anticipating the speedy return of his son, since from the place where he was, he could see the vessel which was bringing him back, and since that vessel was the Pharaon, of which Edmond was the mate, and which was entering the port of Marseilles in full sail. Old Dantès remained all day waiting for his son, and at night was compelled to acknowledge to himself that Edmond would not return home. Then he went to bed, but the old man did not sleep; he had been perfectly well the day before, but the next morning he was pale and haggard; and the next day, and the next, he grew worse and worse. M. Morrel came once or twice, and offered to persuade the old man to remove to his house, and in fact to live with him; so did Mercédès, who would have given up her own chamber to him; but the old man positively refused. Caderousse, who was present, will tell you that he would not take anything. ‘No,’ said he, ‘so long as my son is not here, I will not quit this house; because,’ added he, with a smile that grieved me to the heart, ‘if he should return, he would not know where to find me.’ And yet every day he grew weaker and weaker. Caderousse and I endeavoured, but in vain, to prevail upon him to eat something. Mercédès did more than we did; she cooked him broth, made him custards, brought him sweetmeats; but the poor old man did not even thank her. At last, one morning, he felt so ill that Mercédès sent for a doctor. Caderousse went for him. It was M. de Boville, who had been an intimate friend of Dantès’s and who attended him gratuitously. I was there. I saw the doctor feel his pulse, and then shake his head, and go away, recommending him to be kept very quiet. I went up to the old man’s bedside, and said, ‘Father Dantès, do you want anything?’ He looked at me with eyes that spoke at once his answer—‘I want my son.’ ‘But,’ said I, ‘your son cannot return just yet; in the meantime, is there anything I can do for you?’ ‘No,’ said he; ‘nothing.’ He motioned me away, and I left the room, my heart filled with such grief as I had never before experienced. But when I reached the outside of the house, I met Mercédès, who was coming in, and who said to me, ‘Caderousse, how is he?’ I could only answer by tears; and she, understanding me, covered her face with her hands, and fled towards the city. I returned to the old man. He was calmer, but his eyes were fixed on the door. It was evident that he was still expecting his son. He remained in this state for two days, and on the third, at about ten o’clock in the morning, he died. He died,’ continued Caderousse, his voice trembling with emotion, ‘of grief, of despair, of a broken heart. Ah, M. l’Abbé, if you had seen him die, you would have said, ‘It is not God who has done this, but man!’”\n“And you say that he refused food?” asked the abbé.\n“Yes, he did; and I am sure it was not from want of appetite, for I saw him look at the food Mercédès brought him with a longing eye; but he seemed to have a repugnance to eat, as if it would prolong a life of suffering. He died, as I told you, on the third day, and on the fourth we buried him. M. Morrel and Mercédès alone followed him to the grave. Caderousse and I were there too, but we were not invited. We went of our own accord. We had not seen each other for some time, and we met at the funeral. We shook hands, and that was all. We did not speak. We had nothing to say to each other. When the funeral was over, M. Morrel gave me a hundred francs, and said, ‘Caderousse, this is for you and your wife; and this,’ added he, giving me another hundred francs, ‘is for the expenses of the funeral.’ So you see, M. l’Abbé, that M. Morrel is a worthy man.”\n“And what became of Mercédès?” asked the abbé.\n“Mercédès returned to the Catalans, and has remained there ever since. She lives in the same house, and in the same room. She has never quitted it. She has never forgotten Edmond. She has never ceased to mourn for him. She has never ceased to hope for his return. She has never ceased to love him.”\n“And you say that old Dantès died of grief?”\n“Yes, M. l’Abbé, of grief. I am as sure of it as I am that I am speaking to you. He died because he had lost all hope. He died because he had lost his son.”\n“And you say that he refused food?”\n“Yes, he did. He would not eat. He would not drink. He would not live.”\n“And you say that he died on the third day?”\n“Yes, on the third day, at ten o’clock in the morning.”\n“And you say that M. Morrel and Mercédès alone followed him to the grave?”\n“Yes, they alone. Caderousse and I were there too, but we were not invited.”\n“And you say that M. Morrel gave you a hundred francs for yourself and your wife, and another hundred francs for the expenses of the funeral?”\n“Yes, he did. M. Morrel is a worthy man.”\n“And you say that Mercédès has remained at the Catalans ever since?”\n“Yes, she has. She lives in the same house, and in the same room. She has never quitted it.

We went of our own accord. We had not seen each other for some time, and we met at the funeral. We shook hands, and that was all. We did not speak. We had nothing to say to each other. When the funeral was over, M. Morrel gave me a hundred francs, and said, ‘Caderousse, this is for you and your wife; and this,’ added he, giving me another hundred francs, ‘is for the expenses of the funeral.’ So you see, M. l’Abbé, that M. Morrel is a worthy man.”\n“And what became of Mercédès?” asked the abbé.\n“Mercédès returned to the Catalans, and has remained there ever since. She lives in the same house, and in the same room. She has never quitted it. She has never forgotten Edmond. She has never ceased to mourn for him. She has never ceased to hope for his return. She has never ceased to love him.”\n“And you say that old Dantès died of grief?”\n“Yes, M. l’Abbé, of grief. I am as sure of it as I am that I am speaking to you. He died because he had lost all hope. He died because he had lost his son.”\n“And you say that he refused food?”\n“Yes, he did. He would not eat. He would not drink. He would not live.”\n“And you say that he died on the third day?”\n“Yes, on the third day, at ten o’clock in the morning.”\n“And you say that M. Morrel and Mercédès alone followed him to the grave?”\n“Yes, they alone. Caderousse and I were there too, but we were not invited.”\n“And you say that M. Morrel gave you a hundred francs for yourself and your wife, and another hundred francs for the expenses of the funeral?”\n“Yes, he did. M. Morrel is a worthy man.”\n“And you say that Mercédès has remained at the Catalans ever since?”\n“Yes, she has. She lives in the same house, and in the same room. She has never quitted it. She has never forgotten Edmond. She has never ceased to mourn for him. She has never ceased to hope for his return. She has never ceased to love him.”\n“And you say that she has never ceased to love him?”\n“Yes, M. l’Abbé, she has never ceased to love him.”\n“And you say that she has never ceased to hope for his return?”\n“Yes, M. l’Abbé, she has never ceased to hope for his return.”\n“And you say that she has never ceased to mourn for him?”\n“Yes, M. l’Abbé, she has never ceased to mourn for him.”\n“And you say that she has never forgotten him?”\n“Yes, M. l’Abbé, she has never forgotten him.”\n“And you say that she has never quitted the house?”\n“Yes, M. l’Abbé, she has never quitted the house.”\n",

Morrel,” he said; “who was he?”\n“The owner of the Pharaon and patron of Dantès.”\n“And what part did he play in this sad drama?” inquired the abbé.\n“The part of an honest man, full of courage and real regard. Twenty times he interceded for Edmond. When the emperor returned, he wrote, implored, threatened, and so energetically, that on the second restoration he was persecuted as a Bonapartist. Ten times, as I told you, he came to see Dantès’ father, and offered to receive him in his own house; and the night or two before his death, as I have already said, he left his purse on the mantelpiece, with which they paid the old man’s debts, and buried him decently; and so Edmond’s father died, as he had lived, without doing harm to anyone. I have the purse still by me—a large one, made of red silk.”\n“And,” asked the abbé, “is M. Morrel still alive?”\n“Yes,” replied Caderousse.\n“In that case,” replied the abbé, “he should be a man blessed of God, rich, happy.”\nCaderousse smiled bitterly. “Yes, happy as myself,” said he.\n“What! M. Morrel unhappy?” exclaimed the abbé.\n“He is reduced almost to the last extremity—nay, he is almost at the point of dishonor.”\n“How?”\n“Yes,” continued Caderousse, “so it is; after five-and-twenty years of labor, after having acquired a most honorable name in the trade of Marseilles, M. Morrel is utterly ruined; he has lost five ships in two years, has suffered by the bankruptcy of three large houses, and his only hope now is in that very Pharaon which poor Dantès commanded, and which is expected from the Indies with a cargo of cochineal and indigo. If this ship founders, like the others, he is a ruined man.”\n“And has the unfortunate man wife or children?” inquired the abbé.\n“Yes, he has a wife, who through everything has behaved like an angel; he has a daughter, who was about to marry the man she loved, but whose family now will not allow him to wed the daughter of a ruined man; he has, besides, a son, a lieutenant in the army; and, as you may suppose, all this, instead of lessening, only augments his sorrows. If he were alone in the world he would blow out his brains, and there would be an end.”\n“Horrible!” ejaculated the priest.",

A man from Marseilles was there, who knew him, and who told me of it.”\n\n“The dead know nothing of this world’s affairs,” said the abbé.\n\n“You think so?” said Caderousse. “It may be; but I have my own ideas about it.”\n\n“And why should Edmond Dantès, since he is dead, forgive you?”\n\n“Because I have been a coward, a traitor, and a villain,” said Caderousse; “and, as he was a man of noble heart, he would, perhaps, have forgiven me.”\n\n“And this M.

Ah, if M. Morrel had been there, that would not have happened.”\n\n“So that M. Morrel was not at Marseilles at the time of this arrest?”\n\n“No; he was at Paris, on business. And when he returned, he was in despair. He did all he could to save Edmond. He went to the governor of the prison, to the procureur du roi, to the prefect. But the door was everywhere closed against him. During the Hundred Days, M. Morrel was accused of being a Bonapartist, and only escaped with his life by a miracle. And since the second restoration, he has been suspected. They say he is a liberal. The consequence is, that he has lost his best customers, and is nearly ruined.”\n\n“Nearly ruined!” exclaimed the abbé.\n\n“Yes; he has had losses, one after another. Five ships lost in two years, three bankruptcies of houses he was connected with, and so on. Ah, sir, M. Morrel is an unfortunate man.”\n\n“And his family?”\n\n“He has a wife, a daughter, and a son. His wife is a most estimable woman, who has been a great comfort to him in his misfortunes. His daughter is a charming girl, who was to have been married to a young man she loved, but the marriage is broken off on account of her father’s losses. His son is a lieutenant in the army, and is a brave young man, but he can do nothing for his father.”\n\n“And what is M. Morrel doing now?”\n\n“He is struggling against his misfortunes. He has only one ship left, the Pharaon, the very ship that Edmond commanded. It is expected from the Indies every day. If it arrives safe, and makes a good voyage, he may yet retrieve his affairs. But if it is lost, he is ruined past redemption.”\n\n“And if he is ruined?”\n\n“Then he will do as many others do in such a case.”\n\n“What will he do?”\n\n“He will blow his brains out,” said Caderousse, coolly.\n\n“Good heavens!” exclaimed the abbé.\n\n“And what is more,” continued Caderousse, “he has not a sou to bless himself with. He has sold all he had, except his house and his warehouse. And even those are mortgaged.”\n\n“And did he do nothing for Dantès’s father?”\n\n“Yes, indeed he did. He went to see him every day, and offered him money, and tried to persuade him to come and live with him. But the old man would not. He said he would not leave his house until Edmond returned. And he died of grief, the poor old man. And M. Morrel paid for his funeral, and for the doctor, and for everything. And he left a purse full of money on the mantelpiece, and told me to take care of the old man, and to use the money for him. But the old man died the next day. And I have the purse still. It is a red silk purse.”\n\n“And you have kept it?”\n\n“Yes,” said Caderousse, “I have kept it. It is the only thing I have that belonged to M. Morrel.”\n\n“And you say that M.

Why, he left Marseilles, and was taken, on the recommendation of M. Morrel, who did not know his crime, as cashier into a Spanish bank. During the war with Spain he was employed in the commissariat of the French army, and made a fortune; then with that money he speculated in the funds, and trebled or quadrupled his capital; and, having first married his banker’s daughter, who left him a widower, he has married a second time, a widow, a Madame de Nargonne, daughter of M. de Servieux, the king’s chamberlain, who is in high favor at court. He is a millionaire, and they have made him a baron, and now he is the Baron Danglars, with a fine residence in the Rue du Mont-Blanc, with ten horses in his stables, six footmen in his antechamber, and I know not how many millions in his strongbox.”\n“Ah!” said the abbé, in a peculiar tone, “he is happy.”\n“Happy? Who can answer for that? Happiness or unhappiness is the secret known but to one’s self and the walls—walls have ears but no tongue; but if a large fortune produces happiness, Danglars is happy.”\n“And Fernand?”\n“Fernand? Why, much the same story.”\n“But how could a poor Catalan fisher-boy, without education or resources, make a fortune? I confess this staggers me.”\n“And it has staggered everybody. There must have been in his life some strange secret that no one knows.”\n“But, then, by what visible steps has he attained this high fortune or high position?”\n“Both, sir—he has both fortune and position—both.”\n“This must be impossible!”\n“It would seem so; but listen, and you will understand. Some days before the return of the emperor, Fernand was drafted. The Bourbons left him quietly enough at the Catalans, but Napoleon returned, a special levy was made, and Fernand was compelled to join. I went too; but as I was older than Fernand, and had just married my poor wife, I was only sent to the coast. Fernand was enrolled in the active army, went to the frontier with his regiment, and was at the battle of Ligny. The night after that battle he was sentry at the door of a general who carried on a secret correspondence with the enemy. That same night the general was to go over to the English. He proposed to Fernand to accompany him; Fernand agreed to do so, deserted his post, and followed the general.\n“Fernand would have been court-martialed if Napoleon had remained on the throne, but his action was rewarded by the Bourbons. He returned to France with the epaulet of sub-lieutenant, and as the protection of the general, who is in the highest favor, was accorded to him, he was a captain in 1823, during the Spanish war—that is to say, at the time when Danglars made his early speculations. Fernand was a Spaniard, and being sent to Spain to ascertain the feeling of his fellow-countrymen, found Danglars there, got on very intimate terms with him, won over the support of the royalists at the capital and in the provinces, received promises and made pledges on his own part, guided his regiment by paths known to himself alone through the mountain gorges which were held by the royalists, and, in fact, rendered such services in this brief campaign that, after the taking of Trocadero, he was made colonel, and received the title of count and the cross of an officer of the Legion of Honor.”\n“Destiny! destiny!” murmured the abbé.\n“Yes, but listen: this was not all. The war with Spain being ended, Fernand’s career was checked by the long peace which seemed likely to endure throughout Europe. Greece only had risen against Turkey, and had begun her war of independence; all eyes were turned towards Athens—it was the fashion to pity and support the Greeks. The French government, without protecting them openly, as you know, gave countenance to volunteer assistance. Fernand sought and obtained leave to go and serve in Greece, still having his name kept on the army roll.\nSome time after, it was stated that the Comte de Morcerf (this was the name he bore) had entered the service of Ali Pasha with the rank of instructor-general. Ali Pasha was killed, as you know, but before he died he recompensed the services of Fernand by leaving him a considerable sum, with which he returned to France, when he was gazetted lieutenant-general.”\n“So that now——?” inquired the abbé.\n“So that now,” continued Caderousse, “he owns a magnificent house—No. 27, Rue du Helder, Paris.”",

During the war with Spain, M. Morrel, who had kept up some connection with him, recommended him to the French commissary, who was making immense purchases. His accounts were found correct, and he was made purveyor to the army. Then he speculated with his funds, and even with the funds of the army, and made a fortune. Then he became a stockbroker, and the Spanish government, having need of money, applied to him, and he supplied them with ten millions of reals, for which he received a splendid commission. He then proposed to make a loan of twenty millions, but kept it for himself, and by a clever manœuvre thus gained thirty millions, upon which he founded his fortune. He then married the daughter of the banker of whom he had obtained the loan, and who died shortly afterwards, leaving him half her fortune.

Happiness is a secret between God and himself. But if wealth be happiness, Danglars is happy.”\n“And Fernand?” asked the abbé.\n“Fernand? His story is still more extraordinary.”\n“Indeed?”\n“Yes. You know, or rather you do not know, sir, that Fernand was a Catalan, a poor fisher-boy, and that the foundation of his fortune was the four hundred francs he received from M. Morrel, and which he had not earned. This money was the beginning of his fortune, as the four hundred francs of the marriage portion of Mercédès was the origin of mine. But you shall see. Fernand was a soldier, and as there was a war in Spain, he was sent with the army. The battle of Ligny had taken place, and the emperor was expected at Paris, when Fernand was on guard at the Tuileries. He was a sentry, and was ordered not to allow any one to pass. A general presented himself, and wished to pass. Fernand refused. The general insisted, and Fernand threatened to run him through with his bayonet. The general, seeing that he had to deal with a determined man, drew back, and Fernand remained at his post. The next day, the general, who was a great friend of the emperor, related the affair to him, and the emperor, who was a great admirer of courage, sent for Fernand, and promoted him to the rank of sub-lieutenant. This was the beginning of his fortune. He was sent to Spain, and as he was a Catalan, he knew the country well. He rendered great services, and was promoted to the rank of captain. He was at the siege of Cadiz, and distinguished himself by his bravery. He was made a colonel, and then a general. He was created a count by the king of Spain, and received the cross of the Legion of Honor from the king of France. He is now a lieutenant-general, and lives in a magnificent hotel in the Rue du Helder, No. 27.”\n“So that,” said the abbé, “these two men, who were the cause of the ruin of the poor sailor, have raised themselves, the one to the rank of a millionaire, the other to that of a general?”\n“And this is what I call the justice of heaven!” said Caderousse.",

But I have seen things so extraordinary, that what you tell me seems less astonishing than it otherwise might.”\n“Mercédès was at first in the deepest despair at the blow which deprived her of Edmond. I have told you of her attempts to propitiate M. de Villefort, her devotion to the elder Dantès. In the midst of her despair, a new affliction overtook her. This was the departure of Fernand—of Fernand, whose crime she did not know, and whom she regarded as her brother. Fernand went, and Mercédès remained alone.\n“Three months passed and still she wept—no news of Edmond, no news of Fernand, no companionship save that of an old man who was dying with despair. One evening, after a day of accustomed vigil at the angle of two roads leading to Marseilles from the Catalans, she returned to her home more depressed than ever. Suddenly she heard a step she knew, turned anxiously around, the door opened, and Fernand, dressed in the uniform of a sub-lieutenant, stood before her.\n“It was not the one she wished for most, but it seemed as if a part of her past life had returned to her.\n“Mercédès seized Fernand’s hands with a transport which he took for love, but which was only joy at being no longer alone in the world, and seeing at last a friend, after long hours of solitary sorrow. And then, it must be confessed, Fernand had never been hated—he was only not precisely loved. Another possessed all Mercédès’ heart; that other was absent, had disappeared, perhaps was dead. At this last thought Mercédès burst into a flood of tears, and wrung her hands in agony; but the thought, which she had always repelled before when it was suggested to her by another, came now in full force upon her mind; and then, too, old Dantès incessantly said to her, ‘Our Edmond is dead; if he were not, he would return to us.’\n“The old man died, as I have told you; had he lived, Mercédès, perchance, had not become the wife of another, for he would have been there to reproach her infidelity. Fernand saw this, and when he learned of the old man’s death he returned. He was now a lieutenant. At his first coming he had not said a word of love to Mercédès; at the second he reminded her that he loved her.\n“Mercédès begged for six months more in which to await and mourn for Edmond.”\n“So that,” said the abbé, with a bitter smile, “that makes eighteen months in all. What more could the most devoted lover desire?” Then he murmured the words of the English poet, “‘Frailty, thy name is woman.’”\n“Six months afterwards,” continued Caderousse, “the marriage took place in the church of Accoules.”\n“The very church in which she was to have married Edmond,” murmured the priest; “there was only a change of bridegrooms.”\n“Well, Mercédès was married,” proceeded Caderousse; “but although in the eyes of the world she appeared calm, she nearly fainted as she passed La Réserve, where, eighteen months before, the betrothal had been celebrated with him whom she might have known she still loved, had she looked to the bottom of her heart. Fernand, more happy, but not more at his ease—for I saw at this time he was in constant dread of Edmond’s return—Fernand was very anxious to get his wife away, and to depart himself. There were too many unpleasant possibilities associated with the Catalans, and eight days after the wedding they left Marseilles.”\n“Did you ever see Mercédès again?” inquired the priest.\n“Yes, during the Spanish war, at Perpignan, where Fernand had left her; she was attending to the education of her son.”\nThe abbé started. “Her son?” said he.\n“Yes,” replied Caderousse, “little Albert.”\n“But, then, to be able to instruct her child,” continued the abbé, “she must have received an education herself. I understood from Edmond that she was the daughter of a simple fisherman, beautiful but uneducated.”\n“Oh,” replied Caderousse, “did he know so little of his lovely betrothed? Mercédès might have been a queen, sir, if the crown were to be placed on the heads of the loveliest and most intelligent. Fernand’s fortune was already waxing great, and she developed with his growing fortune. She learned drawing, music—everything. Besides, I believe, between ourselves, she did this in order to distract her mind, that she might forget; and she only filled her head in order to alleviate the weight on her heart. But now her position in life is assured,” continued Caderousse; “no doubt fortune and honors have comforted her; she is rich, a countess, and yet——”\nCaderousse paused.\n“And yet what?” asked the abbé.\n“Yet, I am sure, she is not happy,” said Caderousse.",

Morrel, who had always been a good friend to them, but the old man said, ‘For God’s sake, leave me in peace; have I not trouble enough of my own? It is the will of God. Believe me, it is the best way not to strive against it.’ And Mercédès did not strive against it, but prayed at the church of the Accoules, until her knees were worn. One day, as she was returning from the church of the Accoules, she met Fernand, who had just arrived from the army, and was covered with dust. Fernand saw the young girl’s grief, and it reminded him of the oath he had made to Edmond Dantès. He went to see M. Morrel, and inquired about Edmond. M. Morrel told him that he had disappeared, and that he was supposed to be dead. Fernand then went to see Mercédès. He found her in despair, and he spoke to her of Edmond, and of the oath he had made. Mercédès listened to him, and she saw that he was sincere. She told him that she would wait for Edmond for six months, and that if he did not return in that time, she would marry him. Fernand agreed to this, and he left her. Mercédès waited for six months, and Edmond did not return. She then married Fernand in the church of the Accoules, the very church where she was to have married Edmond. It was a sad wedding. Mercédès was dressed in white, but she was as pale as death. As she passed La Réserve, she nearly fainted. Fernand supported her, and they went on. Eight days after the wedding, Fernand and Mercédès left Marseilles. Fernand had been promoted to the rank of lieutenant, and he was ordered to Spain. I saw Mercédès again at Perpignan, during the Spanish war.

Why,” said he, “Edmond told me that she was a simple Catalan girl, knowing nothing, and having no education.”“That is true,” said Caderousse; “but sorrow has worked a miracle. Besides, she has had a good example in Fernand, who, since he has become rich, has had his son educated in the best schools. And Mercédès is a woman of great intelligence. She has learned drawing, music, and everything that is taught in the schools. She is a queen, sir, a queen!”“And she is happy?” asked the abbé, with a searching look.“Happy? I do not know. She is a great lady, and she has a fine son, but I do not know if she is happy. There are times when she looks very sad, and I have seen her weep. But do not tell her that I told you this. She would be very angry.”“And Fernand?” asked the abbé.“Fernand is a great man. He is a count, and he is very rich. He has a fine house in Paris, and he has a fine son. He is happy, I think. He has forgotten the past.”“And you?” asked the abbé.“I? I am still Caderousse, the innkeeper. I am not rich, but I am not unhappy. I have enough to live on, and I have my wife.

Not in the Catalans anymore. She… she married.”\n\nThe abbé’s face remained impassive, but his eyes, dark and piercing, seemed to bore into Caderousse’s soul. “Married?” he repeated softly, the single word hanging heavy in the air. “To whom?”\n\n“To Fernand,” Caderousse mumbled, looking away. “Fernand Mondego. The one who was her cousin, you know. The fisherman.”\n\nA long silence followed, broken only by the crackling fire and Caderousse’s uneasy shuffling.

And when Edmond… when the other was taken, she waited. Oh, how she waited! For eighteen months, she did nothing but weep and pray. She swore she would die if he didn’t return. She was like a ghost, Father, a shadow of herself.” He shuddered. “It was terrible to see.”\n\n“And then?” the abbé prompted, his voice still low, almost a whisper.\n\n“And then… well, time passes, doesn’t it? And Fernand was always there. Always watching over her, always ready to help. He joined the army, made a name for himself, came back with money.

For her father’s sake, they said. Or maybe just from despair. She married Fernand about eighteen months after the arrest.”\n\nThe abbé closed his eyes for a brief second, a flicker of something unreadable crossing his features.

You are jesting with me.” “I never jest about such things,” replied the abbé; “this diamond is yours, sell it, and with the money buy yourself a house, a field, or whatever you please.” “But why does he give me this?” asked Caderousse; “why does he give me fifty thousand francs?” “Because,” replied the abbé, “he had a diamond which he intended to share with his friends, and as he had but one friend, he gives it to you.” “But I am not his friend,” said Caderousse; “I betrayed him.” “Yes,” replied the abbé; “you betrayed him, but you repented, and that is why he forgives you.” “He forgives me?” cried Caderousse; “he forgives me? Oh, I am unworthy of his forgiveness!” “He knows that,” replied the abbé; “but he is a Christian, and he forgives you.” “Then,” said Caderousse, “this diamond is really mine?” “Yes,” replied the abbé; “it is yours.” Caderousse was so overcome that he could not speak; he looked at the diamond, then at the abbé, then at the diamond again, and at last, with a deep sigh, he said, “But what must I do for this?” “You must do nothing,” replied the abbé; “it is a gift.” “A gift?” repeated Caderousse; “a gift of fifty thousand francs? It is impossible!” “It is true,” said the abbé. “Then,” said Caderousse, “you are a man of God.” “I am a man of God,” replied the abbé, “but I am also a man of justice.” “And what do you ask in return?” asked Caderousse. “I ask nothing in return,” replied the abbé; “but I advise you to make a good use of this money.” “Oh, I will,” said Caderousse; “I will indeed. I will buy a house, and a field, and I will work, and I will be honest.” “That is well,” said the abbé; “and now, give me the red silk purse which M. Morrel left for old Dantès, and which you have.” Caderousse was thunderstruck; he looked at the abbé with a bewildered air. “The red silk purse?” he stammered; “how do you know that?” “I know everything,” replied the abbé, with a smile. Caderousse went to a cupboard, and took out a small red silk purse, faded and worn, with copper runners. “Here it is,” he said, giving it to the abbé. “It is well,” said the abbé, taking the purse; “and now, farewell. Make a good use of the money, and be happy.” “Oh, I will,” said Caderousse; “I will indeed. You are a man of God.” “Farewell,” said the abbé, and he went out. Caderousse remained alone,",

I picked them up, and blessed her. She is the only one who had pity on me, and I am sure she is unhappy.” “And M. de Villefort?” asked the abbé; “did he ever attain to the high station he desired?” “Yes, he is procureur du roi at Paris.” “He is married?” “Yes, to the daughter of the Count de Saint-Méran, a very rich heiress.” “So that,” remarked the abbé, “these four persons, who have been the cause of the ruin of Edmond Dantès, have elevated themselves, as it were, upon his ruin, and have gained wealth, honours, and position, while Edmond Dantès has perished in the depth of a dungeon?” “It is so,” replied Caderousse, “and I only, who had no share in their crimes, have remained poor, wretched, and forgotten.” “You are mistaken, my friend,” replied the abbé; “God may seem sometimes to forget, while his justice reposes, but there always comes a moment when he remembers, and behold! that moment has come for you, since you are poor, and I am sent to you by him.” “By whom?” asked Caderousse. “By the man you have just mentioned,—Edmond Dantès.” Caderousse gave a loud cry, and threw himself back in his chair, which cracked beneath his weight. “By Edmond Dantès? Impossible!” he cried; “since he is dead.” “He is not dead; he is living, and has sent me to you.” “He is living?” repeated Caderousse, mechanically; “then he is out of prison?” “He is out of prison, as you see, and is rich, powerful, and honoured.” “Then you are his friend?” asked Caderousse. “I am more than his friend; I am his confessor.” “And he has sent you to me?” “Yes, he has sent me to you to give you this.” The abbé took from his pocket a diamond of the size of a hazel-nut, and gave it to Caderousse. “For me?” cried Caderousse; “for me?

He stood before the Count of Monte Cristo, his hands clenched, his eyes searching the Count’s impassive features for any sign of hesitation or deceit. The Count had just uttered a statement so damning, so utterly destructive to the young man’s world, that it seemed impossible to accept. It was a truth that struck at the very foundation of his identity, his family, his honor. How could this stranger, this enigmatic figure who had appeared from nowhere, possess such terrible knowledge? And more importantly, how could he be so certain of it? His"

                "refinement_prompt": "IMPROVEMENT GUIDANCE:\n1. MAJOR STRUCTURAL ISSUES:\n- The completion invents a scene where Caderousse is in a state of ecstasy and his wife pulls him by the sleeve, which is not present in the original.\n- The completion omits the entire sequence where Caderousse decides to go to the fair at Beaucaire to have the diamond appraised, as well as his instructions to his wife and his departure from the house.\n- The final reflection by La Carconte when left alone is missing.\n\n2. MISSING ELEMENTS:\n- The completion does not include the specific question from La Carconte about the truth of what she overheard, nor does it capture the initial exchange about the diamond's authenticity.\n- The plan to verify the diamond's value at the fair, the mention of jewellers from Paris, and the time frame for Caderousse's return are all absent.\n- The completion lacks the concluding internal thought or spoken reflection from La Carconte regarding the sum of money.\n\n3. INACCURATE ELEMENTS:\n- The sequence of events is altered: the wife’s suspicion and the discussion about the diamond’s authenticity are presented differently, and the emotional responses are not aligned with the original order.\n- There is an invented justification by Caderousse about why the diamond could not be false, which is not present in the original.\n- The completion introduces a reference to a debt owed to Edmond, which is not part of the original passage at this point.\n- The dialogue and actions are sometimes attributed differently, and the emotional tone of the characters is not always consistent with the original progression."
